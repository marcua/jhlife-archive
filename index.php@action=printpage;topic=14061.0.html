				How awful; that poor woman!&nbsp; <br /><br />Did they ever catch the guy who was seen on camera wearing a mask and hiding in the bushes before he followed and raped the woman walking home from work? <br />

				I don&#039;t know. But I think it&#039;s time for a town hall with the precinct to check on what happened with all these cases and let them know that we care.

				So sad. I see some of these women pushing baby strollers and shopping carts with bottles. I wonder if it is the same rapist from the 84 street incident. I think there should be a neighborhood watch group or perhaps get the guardian angels here!

I second this! How do we go about arranging something like that? We need to reaffirm that we aren&#039;t going to tolerate hate and rape in our neighborhood.

				There are a lot of people on Facebook expressing concern as well:&nbsp; https://www.facebook.com/jacksonheightspost/?fref=ts&nbsp; I do think we need a Town Hall.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been hearing of way too many crimes in this neighborhood in the last 5 months.

				Has anyone seen a police officer in the last few months?&nbsp; There used to be officers on Roosevelt and 37th Ave. on foot patrol as well as officers on horseback.&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot recall seeing any except the ones doing bag check at the subway stations. <br />

				These cases of violence are very upsetting, I feel very sorry for the victims.<br /><br />I felt compelled to look for statistics. Despite the recent reports, it appears that crime level is about the same as last year and remain low by city standards.<br /><br />You can see an interesting crime map here: http://maps.nyc.gov/crime/<br /><br />You can find information about 115th precinct, responsible for Jackson Heights, here:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_115.shtml<br /><br />The link above includes contact information. Recent stats for the precinct here:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-115pct.pdf<br /><br />Citywide stats by precinct here:<br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml<br /><br />

				Thanks for this information.&nbsp; While the recent incidents are totally horrific, it does put things in perspective. It doesn&#039;t mean we should ever tolerate such acts of violence.&nbsp; I think the idea of having more cops or a community patrol is a good idea, and hope there is a town hall meeting regarding this.
