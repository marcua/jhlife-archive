				Does anyone have suggestions for general contractors who are familiar with installating IKEA kitchen cabinets? We&#039;re looking for someone who can demo the old cabinets, as well do some other general contracting work in the kithchen, and install new IKEA cabinets for us. <br /><br />Welcoming any and all suggestions for contractors who are familiar with working in co-ops and the IKEA cabinet system!<br /><br />Thank you!

				I just used Andrew Bartels for my kitchen renovation in my JH co-op with IKEA cabinets (Semihandmade fronts). http://www.bartelscarpentry.com/about<br /><br />He demo&#039;d the old cabinets and floor and installed a very complicated tile floor, did the cabinets, backsplash, installed shelves, hooked up all new appliances, expanded a doorway and built an archway to match the original archway, painted the whole apartment, and refinished all the wood floors.&nbsp; He has a small crew and may be booked up but I was very happy with the final outcome.

				Hi Rory, <br /><br />I just finished my kitchen using Ikea - everything but the doors, which I had made custom. <br /><br />(http://i65.tinypic.com/w71kcy.jpg)<br /><br />Sync construction in Jackson Heights did the work. Aleks is the founder and general contractor on my job: 917-365-3727 or Aleks@syncconstruction.com<br /><br />They did a great job. I&#039;ll use them again.

				NicoleS, Sweeten introduced me to Aleks at Sync. It was a bonus that he lives in Jackson Heights - we were often able to meet in the morning before work and go over things.

				We used the Ikea Kitchen couple (link above) and they were great. Because the partners used to work at Ikea, they know everything you need to order and will schlep to different stores if one place runs out of something. She respected my design, but also tweaked it, making changes I would&#039;ve never thought of doing. It looks great and unlike most of the asshole contractors I dealt with, it was nice to have a woman running the show since she would actually listen to my ideas and speak to me like I was an actual human being. Unlike most of the dudes we got bids from, who directed all talk to my husband, even though I was the one in charge of the project.
