					Dear Community Member:<br />As part of their community service mission, Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) continues to provide low fee and free psychological, psychosocial, and educational programs to benefit the community directly. Below are some of the services available this Fall (2018).&nbsp; Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.&nbsp; Thank you. <br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Skills Group for Boys (ages 7-8) with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) QCPC is offering a social skills group for 7-8 year old boys with ASD.&nbsp; Using evidenced-based techniques, children will be taught critical skills&nbsp; to improve social interactions.&nbsp; The group will also offer a parent training component so that parents can continue practicing these skills at home with the child.&nbsp; The groups are scheduled for Wednesdays 5:30pm-6:30pm for 12 sessions. The cost of group participation is $250.00 which includes the application, screening, child group sessions,&nbsp; parenting sessions and feedback session.&nbsp; (The fee is subsizdized by the college and may be further or completely reduced in the case of financial need. No one will be turned away for inability to pay.) If interested please call Queens College Psychological Center at (718) 570-0500.&nbsp; Interested participants will be administered a brief phone screen, followed by an in-person interview to ensure that the child’s needs can be met by the group.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) for Adolescents (13-17) QCPC has an opening for two Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) slots for adolescents ages 13- 17. TF-CBT is an evidence-based approach to treating and resolving symptoms that can occur after traumatic experiences. This treatment involves the child and caregiver in building coping and safety skills and in creating a narrative of the traumatic experience. This treatment is provided free of charge as a service to the community.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuropsychological Testing for Children: Again this year, we will have a very limited number of low fee slots for comprehensive Neuropsychological Testing of children. (Due to demand that far exceeds available openings, children with medical/neurological issues will be given priority). Please contact QCPC for information.<br /><br /><br />For more information please contact us at <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or&nbsp; 718-570-0500. Visit us at <a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;QCPC is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-21 Main Street, Flushing, Queens.&nbsp; Mental health problems are treatable and QCPC&#039;s mission is to implement effective, compassionate, culturally responsive, and accessible (free and low fee) psychosocial treatment and educational programs to benefit the community directly.&nbsp; Treatment is provided by doctoral candidates in the Clinical Psychology at Queens College Doctoral Program who are closely supervised by experienced and licensed faculty. All services are confidential and available to the community regardless of ability to pay. <br /><br />

					Dear Community Member:<br /><br />Friendship is an important part of every child’s development – having even one or two close friends can help to increase a child’s self-esteem, independence, and confidence. Making (and keeping friends) for boys who struggle with ADHD can be difficult. They may struggle to pick up on verbal and nonverbal cues or to remain calm and regulated when social situations get difficult.<br /><br />Queens College Psychological Center is currently offering a social skills group aimed at boys ages 8-9 with these difficulties. Treatment is evidence-based, breaking down peer social interactions into discrete skills and helping parents develop strategies so they can maintain progress at home and for the long term. Some sessions will also be devoted to practicing the skills that have been taught. The group is comprised of once weekly group sessions held in tandem for both parent and child. Individual feedback sessions will be held for each participant after the last group session. Interested participants will be offered a brief phone screen, followed by an in person interview to ensure the child’s needs can best be met by the group. As a community service, most of the cost will be subsidized by the college, and the fee is $250.00 (this includes the application, group screening, child group sessions, and parenting sessions). The fee may be further reduced in the case of financial need. No one will be turned away for inability to pay. Groups will tentatively run on Tuesdays at 5:00 beginning Tuesday January 16th&nbsp; and run for twelve sessions through April 17th.&nbsp; The group will meet every Tuesday in between these dates, with the exception of Tuesdays February 20th and April 3rd. <br /><br />For more information regarding our children&#039;s Social Skills Group for 8-9 year old boys with ADHD, please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or call 718-570-0500.

The clinic continues to offer treatment for problems such as depression, stress, anxiety, interpersonal/relational issues, dissatisfaction with current personal or interpersonal life choices, grief and bereavement, coping with medical illness or disability, trauma, self-esteem and body image concerns, parenting issues and adjustment to changing life circumstances. For children, typical problems may include separation anxiety, school refusal, social anxiety, fears, phobias, social skills deficits, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), tantrums, aggression, depression, moodiness, impulsivity, defiance and disobedience.&nbsp; The clinic team works closely with our child clients’ schools and does school visits when necessary. Fees for these services are based on a sliding scale from zero to fifty dollars (average fee is $10) that takes into account personal and/or family income and circumstances. This community mental health service is a training and research center operated by the Ph.D. program in clinical psychology. Advanced doctoral candidates in the college’s Clinical Psychology doctoral program provide treatment to patients under the close supervision of experienced, licensed psychologists on the Queens College faculty.
