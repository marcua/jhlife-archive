The matter was resolved when my classmate&#039;s mother visited the school, entered into conversation with Miss Katz in the hallway outside our classroom and, somehow, was unable to prevent our &#039;teacher&#039; from falling down a flight of stairs. The mother had survived Hitler&#039;s extermination camps and, quite apparently, knew how to deal with the Miss Katz&#039;s of this world in a definitive manner.<br /><br />I did not possess such skills, however, and Miss Katz simply terrified me as was her intent. I travelled to school each morning in great fear of what would happen to me that day and wended my way home in fear of the day to follow. Finally I decided to run away. I left a note for my parents and walked from 90th St. and 34th Ave. all the way to Flushing Meadow park where I spent the day thinking what I might do next; the thought of suicide was not absent from a child&#039;s mind. Finally it began to grow dark and so, like many another runaway -- Beaver Cleaver comes to mind -- I began to walk home. That week I was taken out of Miss Katz&#039;s classroom and placed into a more hospitable -- and sane -- environment but I never forgot Miss Katz or the terrors which she had caused to well up inside me.<br /><br />At seventy four years of age I&#039;m very glad to have the opportunity to tell this story to whomever reads or writes here. I&#039;ve never told it before -- ashamed to I guess -- and it strikes me that it may help some others, with similar experiences, to make a certain peace within themsleves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I thought it might be useful -- for so many of us -- to have a place in which we might record some of the hurts which came along with being &#039;educated&#039; inside the NY Public School System of long, long ago; A sort of catharsis where we could relate -- perhaps for the first time in our lives -- what it was like to be &#039;taught&#039; by some who should not have been teaching at all, but who wound up as &#039;teachers&#039; in Jackson Heights. Whether you attended PS69, PS148, or any of the other public schools, here is a place where you can rid yourself of some very bad memories while sharing them with your fellow sufferers. <br /><br />Please change their names in order to protect the innocent or, perhaps, the not-so-innocent.

All the xxxridges had yet to appear and the places where they now stand were open fields, some of which still bore plow marks. We children called them, collectively, &quot;the lots,&quot; and did not realize, until too late, how fortunate we were to have them in which to play. Northridge did come along in 1954 -- I think -- and that marked the beginning of the &quot;red canyons.&quot; All of those buildings started life as rental apartments... You probably knew that.<br /><br />Did you live in that very nice building with the two tower &#039;dunce-caps?&#039; &nbsp;As a child I always wished that I could live there.

If it were possible I would surely take you up on it. My own experience in the PS environment (PS149,148) was child shattering and I actually do remember wishing that I could attend that pretty school up on that lovely hill... At age seventy four I suspect that they would no longer have a place for me. <img src="Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" />

					It wasn&#039;t in Jackson Heights but we used to take the elevated train -- a nickel then -- from 90th St. and Roosevelt to (can&#039;t remember the stop --- was there a Sunnyside stop?) where, for twenty five cents you got a locker, a key (with an elastic band that went around your wrist), and could swim all day... A lot of kids from Jackson Heights went there. The only other pool we knew about was in Whitestone, a long ways off.<br /><br />A girl my age (about 10 or 11) -- her name was Janet -- used to run around the pool and shove me in when I was standing at the edge. I would angrily ask my friend,Jackie Dugan, why she was doing this and he replied that he thought &quot;She&#039;s nuts! She likes you.&quot; &nbsp;Girls matured more quickly than boys in those days. <img src="Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
