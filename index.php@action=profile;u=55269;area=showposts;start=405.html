					As an addendum to the private email which I have just now sent to Lillybell, commenting on the Wikipedia attachment, regarding the &quot;proper&quot; use of Capital Letters, within Internet communiques, which I recently received from this person, I suggest that everyone who reads all of the back/forth (one such note is absolutely false, untrue and dishonest, mind you) on my recent posting above, including Lillybell, should carefully read and take note of the comments, which follow the clip. I find one comment in particular here, which specifically echoes my sentiments on the use of Capital Letters across varied modes (not only Internet) of writing, in general. A Side Note To Lillybell: Really, Wikipedia as a respected source of anything??? I find absolutely shocking the fact that you would think to even use something like this website as a marker for anything, let alone the type of attachment which you believe is so important to send on to me, obviously, which you believe is a key as a learning lesson on the use of Capital Letters for Internet Postings. I am quite surprised. Please Note that as a College Professor, I would never allow any student of mine to ever use a non-peer reviewed source, such as Wikipedia. Perhaps as you have twice commented on my use of Capital Letters, you would be equally well founded and well taught to do your homework, in terms of the type of research and poor understanding of the kinds of websites, information, etc., which you believe are proper, appropriate, truthful, peer-reviewed, etc. I hope that I have made my point loud and clear. Enough said. Adrienne

					I appreciate everyone&#039;s remarks; I shall be more mindful in future. As a magazine editor, I simply am used to writing this way, but apparently for the readers of JHL who are annoyed, upset, et al, about my use of upper case letters in my postings, I shall definitely take note going forward. I surely hope&nbsp; that&nbsp; nobody would take all of so seriously as to bypass any Flea Market, event, which I have posted. Merci encore. Adrienne&nbsp; &nbsp;
