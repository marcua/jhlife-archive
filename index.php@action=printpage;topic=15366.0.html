				I&#039;m not an expert in the different coops but I would say that if low maintenance and location are priorities then Hampton Court and the Greystones might be good choices for you.&nbsp; They are both walk-ups so you don&#039;t have the expense of an elevator.&nbsp; Both&nbsp; are located just north of 37th Avenue so are very central in the Historic District.&nbsp;

				Both of those coops have apartments that size.&nbsp; Of note, each building is it&#039;s own coop in those complexes.&nbsp; So there are only about 10 apartments in each one.&nbsp; Hampton Court has a large central garden while the Greystones have gardens behind each building.&nbsp; There are definitely other good options around especially if you prefer an elevator building.&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested to hear other people&#039;s thoughts.&nbsp;

				Let me preface this by saying I do not yet live in JHs. And I have no idea what your budget is for two-three bedroom. But I&#039;ve been looking at one bedrooms quite a bit since the start of the year and I really liked Colonial Court...an elevator building. Yes it was built in 1940 so is it pre-war? That is borderline. Spaces seem to be a good value for the maintenance. Great location.<br /><br />Now do I live there? No I don&#039;t. And I have not yet seen a three bedroom listed there at all. The two bedrooms look pretty nice.

				LOL lalochezia!!!<br /><br />Each entrance at the Greystones is its own co-op and is managed separately.&nbsp; A few of them have 10 units (two apartments per floor), but most have 15 (3 apartments per floor).&nbsp; The Greystones do have a large central garden in the back......not individual gardens behind each building.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If your order of priority is as you state -- amenities, location and financials (low maintenance) - I imagine you will be a daily commuter to Manhattan which makes the buildings on 34th Avenue such as The Towers, Chateau and Terrace View off-putting because of the 15-20 min walk to the subway. <br /><br />Some of the buildings which I like are:<br />1) Colton - this is a condo with a great rooftop terrace, doorman and a bike room. Located on 35th Avenue and 76th St so less than 10 min walk to the subway.<br />2) Hawthorne Court - private elevator into your apartment, wood burning fireplaces, private garden courtyard<br />3) Belvedere East and West - great private garden with a live fish pond, large apartments and also close to the subway.<br />4) Linden Court - on 37th Ave, also a garden apartment complex, and great historic details.<br /><br />The biggest issue you will run into is inventory. Three bedrooms don&#039;t come up often and when they do, expect jaw-dropping pricing ala http://www.mpcproperties.com/queenscooplistings.php?cid=196&amp;m=1&amp;i=390<br /><br />As far as maintenance goes, if you are paying &lt; $.85/psf, then I would say it is pretty reasonable.

				I&#039;ll throw in a vote for The Fillmore here! We love our building. It&#039;s had a bunch of recent improvements (new laundry room, new landscaping/garden) and is close to 7 train, organic grocery store, 24 hr Rite Aid. Really nice pre-war architectural features, and big bedrooms. Hawthorne Court and Belvedere are nice too.

				I would add the Berkeley and Warwick to the list.&nbsp; They both look like very well maintained buildings.&nbsp; The Berkeley has a nice internal garden but I don&#039;t know much else about them.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s interesting that in these discussions that location often becomes mostly about proximity to the 74th Street subway station.&nbsp; It&#039;s great to be close to so many subway lines but I also think that there are other considerations aside from subway access.&nbsp; For example, I think 80th street between 37th Avenue and 33rd Avenue is one of the nicest streets in New York City.&nbsp; It might be a bit more of a walk to the subway but has the advantage of living on a really lovely block.&nbsp;

				In terms of subway access, there&#039;s also the buses to get you there. I have to admit I don&#039;t use them during rush hour but when I take them at other times they are usually on time and most have a GPS for apps. I&#039;m less enamored of the Q32 and Q33 just because the route they take has more traffic and is often a little slower, but both get you to the 82nd St. station on the 7. 74th St. is a terminal for the Q49, Q32, &amp; Q33, so a quick check on an app on your phone can tell you whether or not a bus that goes near your building is leaving soon, or if taking the escalator up to the 7 train is a better option.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the buses that run along Northern or where they take you (likely down to Queens Plaza, no?)

				Cyril108 I guess it&#039;s different strokes for different folks. We chose Hawthorne because it was the closest complex in the historic district to the subway hub at 74th St, plus we loved the layout of the apartments and the garden and yes, the working fireplace. The block is not as pretty as the one you mention, or as others in the neighborhood, but the proximity to the big grocery stores, post office, dry cleaners, E77 etc, is the other reason we love the location. Grocery store is on my way home from work and just half a block from my apartment. Good deli right on my corner. JuJu&#039;s across the street. We love being so close to everything--closer than we were in our former apartment in a different part of NYC, where everything but the subway (which was right next door) was a 15 minute walk. The convenience of this location is something we are still excited about five years after moving here.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s all personal preference. but could&#039;t be more happy with Linden Court here.&nbsp; Beautiful pre-war with lots of character with a wonderful block long yard.&nbsp; It&#039;s close to all shopping on 37th and Roosevelt, less than a 5 minute walk to 82nd street station (and its only 12 to 74th street).&nbsp; The two and three bedrooms have four exposures and three beautiful windows in the living room makes for a wall of windows.&nbsp; All units have a large storage area (ours is 6&#039;x9&#039;x9&#039;) with no wait list.&nbsp; There are garages, but those do have a wait list.&nbsp; Walls are plaster and lathe, which makes reno&#039;s more expensive, but give nice solid soundproof walls.<br /><br />Maintenance is kept low (low 600&#039;s) because we are self managed, own the land, have no elevator and get rental income from the basement rental unit and garage rentals.<br /><br />I also give it a plus because there is a strict no Airbnb thing here.&nbsp; Last thing I want is a mini-hotel running from my neighbors place.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Do you really think a renovation affects only that apt.?

Some co-ops state in their rules as soon as you do ANY renovation you have to bring utilities up to scratch.

				My only comment is on financials.&nbsp; You should not look to whether the maintenance charge is low or high.&nbsp; Many factors lead to a low monthly maintenance.&nbsp; In a good building, it means that the underlying mortgage is paid and that the building has a healthy reserve account in the event that a major repair is needed (new boiler, etc.).&nbsp; In a bad building it means that the building has not been adequately maintained over the years because the building could not afford to do so, and that increases (or assessments) will be forthcoming to deal with this issue.&nbsp; Likewise, a higher maintenance charge could mean that you get more amenities (elevator, well curated garden), as well as a end-of-year tax break for your percentage of mortgage interest paid.&nbsp; Of course, it could also mean that the underlying mortgage carries a heavy debt burden, or that the building has a high sponsor presence.<br /><br />Long and short, ask questions before you decide, and don&#039;t base your decision merely on the monthly maintenance.&nbsp; Do your due diligence before purchasing.

				Hi everyone - <br /><br />New here and as my name indicates, I&#039;m looking in JH so this topic is of particular interest to me. As an anonymous board, I&#039;m hoping to get some information to help in my search and weigh against what I&#039;m getting from realtors and my friends who own in some of these buildings. I love the apartments in JH! What you can get for your money in terms of space, charm, history makes it pretty ideal to me. <br /><br />My favorite buildings would be: The Towers, Hawthorne, Chateau, Elm, Fillmore, The Colonials, The Delano. <br /><br />With regard to the Hawthorne - I see 2 are for sale right now: a 2 bed on 77th and a 3 bed (3rd is sunroom) on 76th. I understand the 3 bed would of course be more, but what I cannot understand is it being $250K more than the 2 bed. If I&#039;ve been told correct, all the Hawthorne&#039;s are individually managed by building - surely this can&#039;t be a reason for such a huge variance in pricing? The maintenance fees are comparable enough and all things being equal, I can&#039;t fathom an extra $250K for the extra room. Am I missing something? <br /><br />Itsit mentioned the board at the Towers - as this is my preferred/favourite building in JH, any chance you could expand? My understanding is unlike the Chateau, Hawthorne, Elm, and Greystones that the Towers is managed as a single unit with a single board vs separate management and boards for each building. <br /><br />As I travel a few months a year on business, I&#039;ve been advised not to disclose this unless asked as boards don&#039;t like it. Based on experiences, can any of you offer whether this may be true?&nbsp; Its not like I&#039;d be renting it out or anything. Another potential &quot;stumbling block&quot; as one realtor put it, is that I&#039;m one person looking for a 2 or 3 bedroom (1 bed for me, 1 for guests/home office or 1 guest and 1 office). Again, I wouldn&#039;t be sharing, so at a loss why that&#039;s an issue. <br /><br />Finally - as you all live here, what is your opinion -- local JH realtor or no? I&#039;ve seen units with realtors from larger Manhattan based firms, but even tho friends in neighborhood advise against, I&#039;m thinking local guys may have more influence with boards and/or hold pocket listings? Thoughts?

				Hi, I&#039;m running out the door so I can&#039;t write much right now, but have you thought about Washington Plaza?&nbsp; It&#039;s right on the border of the historic district and the prices are similar to The Towers/Chateau, etc.&nbsp; (but is closer to the 74th street transit hub). It&#039;s a rental building undergoing a conversion to luxury coops - but please note that the owner has already raised prices once and the maintenance fees are pretty high. <br /><br />It might be worth a look since there&#039;s no board approval necessary (if you are worried about your travel hurting you in an interview)<br /><br />www.wplaza.nyc.com (http://www.wplazanyc.com)<br />&nbsp;

				Hey LookingInJH.&nbsp; Jackson Heights is a wonderful neighborhood.&nbsp; I moved here for the same reasons.&nbsp; I think the long list of buildings being discussed shows that you have lots of good options.&nbsp; Nothing is going to be perfect but you have to find the trade offs that work for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would say that the local brokers, who get most of the listings, prefer buyers to work directly with them and not through an outside broker (that way they get the full 6% commission).&nbsp; This obviously has some risk as you would not have a broker working on your behalf.&nbsp; But if you know the area and pricing well, which it sounds like you do, then it might open up some additional possibilities. <br /><br />One reason for a large difference in price between apartments might be the condition of the apartment.&nbsp; As these are older buildings, some apartments have been well maintained and upgraded and others have not.&nbsp; Renovations can be very expensive and a big headache.&nbsp; So if the apartment is larger and in better condition, I can see that type of price difference.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the listings you mentioned but that is one possibility.&nbsp; <br /><br />You are correct that the Towers and Fillmore are each a single coop and each building of Hawthorne, Elm, and Chateau are individual coops.&nbsp; So each entrance is it&#039;s own coop.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about the Delano or Colonials.&nbsp; So you would essentially be on the board in Hawthorne, Elm, and Chateau.&nbsp; Especially with your travel schedule this might be something for you to consider.&nbsp; Your travel might also be a negative during a board interview for these smaller coops.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, I don&#039;t think anyone cares if you live in a large apartment by yourself.&nbsp; As long as you have the financial ability to cover the maintenance, I don&#039;t see a problem.&nbsp; They might make assumptions but I don&#039;t see it as a reason not to get the place you want!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Lilybell - Thanks for your reply! I am familiar with WP as I&#039;ve friends who have lived in the buildings. One couple moved out about six years ago to buy a house up in the 80&#039;s. They loved it and speak highly of WP still. Another was a single gent, he just moved out I want to say in May - another who loved WP, but did not love the conversion process or pricing. There&#039;s still a couple I know there and they are buying their apt, but I&#039;ve gotten one read from one of them, and a different one from the other! I have to say the rooms in WP are huge! The buildings themselves are well cared for - I would have thought they were co-ops already to be honest. I have looked at their site and seen ads in NYT for them but I&#039;m leery about the pricing and the conversion. A sponsor holding the majority on the board can be nightmarish. Also, I can&#039;t get past 73rd street -- it just always looks so dirty and seems kind of chancy at night. For the prices WP is asking, I&#039;d be as happy spending it in one of the other buildings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cyril - thanks for your response and input! I&#039;m long enough in the tooth to not have this impossible wish list of &quot;must haves&quot; - trust me! ;-) Ideally, a 2 or 3 bed with 2 baths would suit me just fine. Renovations wouldn&#039;t scare me away either - though one hopes the board requirements for renos aren&#039;t overly onerous either. As was touched on earlier in this thread, renovating back to and/or keeping the original features would be right up my alley vs &quot;modernizing&quot; an apt and losing all that charm. <br /><br />W/R/T the disparity in pricing, the pics on NYT site show two well kept even updated apts - if you search &quot;11372&quot; and 2 beds on NYT site, you&#039;ll see the two Hawthorne Court apts - one on 77th and one on 76th. Even with one needing a reno (which it doesn&#039;t appear to) and one with an extra bed, $250K difference in price still seems like A LOT to me. <br /><br />I agree with you - the smaller co-ops would view travel/absence as a negative as they need &quot;all hands on deck&quot; so to speak to run the co-op. Honestly, that wouldn&#039;t be for me. Providing the building is run well, finances managed, etc. I&#039;m happy enough to be a regular shareholder. I suppose I should narrow my search on this criteria now and reach out to some local brokers in JH hoping they have some listings not on NYT (I&#039;ve seen the one in the Towers for sale and not for me). <br /><br />I only asked about 1 person buying a large apt as one of my good friends in the Chateau warned that some boards &quot;don&#039;t like that&quot; -- something about being afraid who could be moving in with me or such. Silly I thought.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again for your replies!!

				There are two 3bed/2bath apartments in the Hawthorne.&nbsp; One is $975,000 and the other is $1,100,000.&nbsp; Check the MCP site to see both.&nbsp; http://www.mpcproperties.com/queenscooplistings.php <br /><br />The 2 bed/ 2 bath apartment is $725,000<br />http://www.nytimes.com/real-estate/usa/ny/queens/jackson-heights/homes-for-sale/35-28-77th-street/46-2523757<br />The 2nd bedroom of the 2/2 apartment is listed as &quot;bedroom/den&quot; -- could this be a clue as to why it&#039;s lower priced?&nbsp; Also the maintenance of this 2/2 is higher (at $1300) than the maintenance of the other two 3/2 apartments, one of which is only $1000.<br /><br />The floorplan of the $1.1 million 3/2 apartment very clearly shows three bedrooms with doors and closet.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 2/2 apartment floorplan seems a little odd to me.&nbsp; The second bedroom doesn&#039;t have a door or a closet.&nbsp; There is clearly space to utilize it as a giant bedroom with ensuite bathroom, and even to put in a built-in closet; why wouldn&#039;t they just close off the wall?&nbsp; It seems the current owners are using the 2/2 as a one bedroom/two bathroom apartment, and the floor plan matches up to that usage.&nbsp; I find it a bit strange, but it must be luxurious to have all that space for two living rooms and a dining room, especially if the owner is just a single person (or couple).<br /><br />Maybe the coop would forbid the wall to be built to close the &quot;den&quot; off to make it a proper bedroom?&nbsp; So many questions!!<br /><br />

				Hi Shelby - I hadn&#039;t looked at (or known about) the MPC site - thanks for the direct! I&#039;m curious about the $1.1M apt - says call broker/owner, I&#039;m taking that to mean its his own apt. In any event, I&#039;ve been in both 3-beds and 2-beds apts in the Hawthorne as a guest -admittedly none of these- and my understanding is that every other bldg on both 77th and 76th streets alternate between 2-beds and 3-beds. I also recall being told that the apts originally were designed as 1-bed and 2-beds with a sunroom (the 2nd or 3rd bed as currently marketed). That makes sense to me, as this room is right off the dining room, accessed via French doors and have two walls of windows. In the 2-bed I was a guest in, the bedroom was given to the kids when they came along and the parents used what was the TV room (sunroom) as their bedroom. The 3-bed I was in had the sunroom as a kind of den/tv room as well. The ensuite in this room was also fairly small, bordering on tiny. I see what you say about the layout on the 2-bed in NYT -- looks like to me at some point the doorway to the sunroom was expanded and the French doors removed, so one would need to put that all back in order to make it a proper bedroom. The 2-bed as I remember my friends - that closet in the dining room, the entrance door was actually in sunroom. I agree with you, as it is now, the layout is pretty odd and would require some reno to bring it back to how it was to utilize as a proper 2-bed. But as you say, all depends on whether the board would allow it. <br /><br />As far as the maintenance, I suppose that&#039;s what happens when each building is individually managed - you get the same apts with different monthlies based on the bldg you&#039;re in as there don&#039;t seem to be any additional amenities one bldg offers over another. <br /><br />Thanks again -- I continue to look...

In New York State, brokers are required by law to disclose this. It&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing. In those instances, the broker&#039;s fee is usually reduced a little bit (from 6% to 5%, good for the seller!) since the broker doesn&#039;t have to split the commission. And while your broker is also representing the seller&#039;s interests, your broker also knows a little more to get the deal done (what&#039;s the seller&#039;s real number to sell, and what&#039;s the buyer&#039;s real number go buy).<br /><br />The benefit of the local broker is he or she is more likely to have insight in to a building&#039;s financials and know the board requirements (income requirements; debt to income ratio; financial reserves required after closing). I wasted time and money with my first broker when she steered me to an apartment in a building I later found out required buyers to have significantly more money in the bank after closing than I would have had (also suggesting to me problems down the road with big assessments). I made an offer on that apartment and paid a lawyer to review minutes for a building I simply didn&#039;t have enough money saved to pass the board requirements. My second broker got a solid sense of my financial temperament, and really knew a lot about how the building&#039;s were run, their financials, and board requirements. I&#039;d be happy to give you a referral via PM is you&#039;re interested.

				Totally agree CaptainFlannel.&nbsp; The local brokers know a lot about the different coops that can really help someone find the right fit for their needs.&nbsp; However, the culture is different here compared to Manhattan where people go around with a &quot;buyer&#039;s broker&quot; and look at places.&nbsp; In Jackson Heights it seems to work much better to reach out to the various local brokers or go to their open houses and inquire about their listings.&nbsp; They often have listings about to go on the market and you can often get in early or even before they hit the market.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Thoughts? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe that the 3-bedrooms with the sunrooms are really &quot;classic six&quot; apartment layout; a design that is more prevalent in pre-war buildings.&nbsp; The &quot;third&quot; bedroom is really a maid&#039;s room, which is connected to the dining room or kitchen while the other bedrooms are on the other side of the apartment.&nbsp; Moreover, the maid&#039;s room normally has its own bathroom and closet.&nbsp; Hence, the layout is of a different era that does not make sense to us today, i.e., most people do not want their maid living in their 3 bedroom apartment when the maid can go home at night and report for duty the next day.&nbsp; In any case, the prices seem to be dictated by what people are willing to pay for them.&nbsp; With that being said, if I were willing to pay over $1,000,000, I would start my search in Manhattan!<br /><br />With respect to brokers, local brokers can get you inside information to the extent that they have specialized in this neighborhood as professionals and live here as well.&nbsp; They know the quirks associated with each individual coop, whether 14 different coops that make up the Hawthorne or a single large coop representing all the shareholders in the entire complex.&nbsp; Local brokers can also set realistic expectations (i.e., the amount of time it takes to get a meeting with a coop board) and have more sway with the coop boards to the extent that they often have personal relationships with other members of the community.&nbsp; And, as others have mentioned, the local brokers know which listings are coming up, i.e., they live in the neighborhood and hear of apartments becoming vacant as a result of estate sales - people do not tend to move out of the neighborhood voluntarily.&nbsp; If a broker knows you are serious, that inside information can be invaluable and can mean the difference between getting or not getting the apartment you want.&nbsp; <br /><br />As to buildings in JH, the Towers is an awesome complex, if you do not have to take the train.&nbsp; If you have to take the train, it is a bit of a hike to 74th Street (where all the express trains are) or 82nd Street (where the 7 Train runs).&nbsp; If you do not have to take the train to work, I would say that the Towers is an awesome building - especially because there&#039;s tons of food options nearby on Northern Blvd.

				That Hawthorne Court apartment with the sunroom made into a den was altered from the original Hawthorne Court layout. All the apartments in Hawthorne Court&#039;s 14 buildings have the same layout--as someone said, alternate buildings have either the larger size or the smaller size. The sunroom is the second bedroom in the smaller ones, and the third bedroom in the larger ones. Many apartments, though, have been altered in various ways over the years. The reason for the large price differential between the 3 bedrooms and the 2 bedrooms is simple: low supply and high demand for larger apartments. Prices are what the market will bear. If there are people willing to pay that much more for 3 bedrooms, those units will be priced that high. There is no real estate judge sitting on high somewhere deciding what&#039;s a fair price for a 3 bedroom in JH. Prices in these buildings have shot up just in the past year or so, I assume due to low supply and high demand. Lots of young couples priced out of Manhattan and Brooklyn who want a couple of kids and need that much space.<br /><br />The thing about these small individual coops is--they are all different based on their individual histories (was the building well maintained over the decades, and well run?) which is the reason for the differing maintenance figures. Some of them have replaced their roofs and done other expensive work that has raised the maintenance, and others have not--which means that expense may be upcoming. <br /><br />And who will your neighbors be--do they get along or are there difficult personalities in the building, making it hard for people to work well together to run the building? That is something that&#039;s impossible to know in advance--and it&#039;s a risk you take going into a small coop. <br /><br />Do NOT go into a small coop if you are not willing to help run the building. If that&#039;s the case, go into one of the larger coops in JH. In a small coop, everyone must be willing to help--at least that&#039;s the way it should be. In reality, it&#039;s often just a few residents who do all the work, which is unfair and causes resentment. <br /><br />If it sounds like I speak from experience--I do. I&#039;m in Hawthorne Court, having arrived here 5 years ago. It&#039;s worked out well for us--we love the apartment and the garden--but it&#039;s definitely something to get used to, living in a small coop where you have to help manage things, and where there can be personality conflicts that can affect that process. <br /><br />We came from a much bigger coop in Manhattan, with a management company and a unionized staff. A very different living situation. And yes, a small coop will want residents who are around most of the time for that very reason. To handle some of the responsibilities. That&#039;s the ideal, although in practice that&#039;s often not the case. In my coop we have two absentee owners, people who have owned apartments here for decades, but who now live elsewhere and are rarely on the premises. Subletting is not allowed, so those apartments are almost always empty. The good thing about that is we use less water in the building (lower maintenance), and there is less demand for the laundry machines and less use of the elevator. But the downside is that there are fewer people to help with building management. So on the rare occasions when an apartment does turn over, we really do stress to a potential owner that we want whoever buys the apartment to be willing to pitch in and help. Just to explain why it really is an issue, at least in the small coops.

So, as a buyer you are free to go to open houses, make inquires, etc. I think it would be exhausting to try and keep straight which apartments you initiated contact on your own and which the broker you are working with showed you, and potentially quite awkward (and unethical) if your broker showed you an apartment you had already made inquiries about. The ethical thing to do is if you are working with a broker, you let all seller&#039;s agents know you are working with X broker. If you don&#039;t mind being the kind of person who cuts out the broker who is working on your behalf out of a commission and are comfortable doing all the negotiations yourself and don&#039;t think you need information prior to making a bid about the building&#039;s financials, board requirements, etc., I&#039;d say there&#039;s no reason to work with a broker in the first place, so don&#039;t waste his or her time.<br /><br />I will say there are some seller&#039;s agents who are difficult if you let them know you are working with an agent. But that&#039;s just unprofessional behavior and says a lot about the agent being more interested in getting the full commission than the agent&#039;s interest in their client&#039;s best interests.

We came from a partly self-managed building in brooklyn. A management company handled billing and daily maintenance like garbage but owners were expected to give time to major projects (three sewer pipes collapsed in the time I was there!). It was pretty exhausting being on that board and having a FT job.<br /><br />We went for a larger co-op when we moved here, and that was one of our considerations. <br /><br />RE: the smaller co-ops, where each building has a different history, this is an area where I think a buyers agent can be very helpful -if you find one who really knows the neighborhood. We didn&#039;t use one and I&#039;m not in the business, but that&#039;s my observation.
