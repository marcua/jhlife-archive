				Interesting, I wonder if they bought the place? From a bartender, I thought it was the same owner bringing in new people. Of course, he didn&#039;t say anything about closing completely for a period. Is it still called Legends? <br /><br />I kind of hope it&#039;s a new owner and the have a better tap list. That would be awesome.

				alchemy is run by a different person than the previous owner of the bbq operation. he rents the back space from the owners, same arrangement that&#039;s been in place since robert pearson moved the original pearson&#039;s there from LIC back in the &#039;90s.<br /><br />if it&#039;s the john brown&#039;s folks, the food is going to be excellent. they have a really good smoker setup and all in place, the last crew just lost a little mojo over the past couple of years.

				texas bbq is primarily beef -- brisket and ribs -- and is usually served unsauced/with sauce on the side. north carolina, memphis are pork-centric, and there&#039;s a really specialized kentucky strain (hard to come by in this area) of mutton/lamb.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8218.msg48058.html#msg48058">Quote from: 83Street on March 29, 2013, 01:12:09 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m glad to hear that barbecue will remain available in the neighborhood.

				Went to the Grand Opening tonight.&nbsp; Brisket was off the hook.&nbsp; Homemade BBQ sauce was super tasty, and on the spicy side.&nbsp; Same went for the slaw.&nbsp; Also had the chicken, which was a little intense on the smokiness and spice for my taste (however perfectly cooked), but others seemed to enjoy.&nbsp; Also sampled the wings, which were nice and had a sweet and spicy taste.&nbsp; The owner says once they get their kitchen fully up and running they are going to offer Tex Mex meals in addition to the Texas style BBQ.&nbsp; The crew there seem eager and willing to please and welcome feedback and suggestions.&nbsp; Looking forward to returning.&nbsp; Next time I think its ribs...

				This place is the truth!<br /><br />I also tried the goat ribs. I really don&#039;t think there&#039;s a practical way to bbq goat without being chewy--- that&#039;s why it&#039;s always in stews. But yeah, this is something new for JH. and awesome. If they can do well, other similar places will come too.

				re: the culture clash aspect.<br /><br />i find it amusing that NYC &#039;cue aficionados who get a little -- or a lot -- miffed about not being able to get a 90 minute IPA or a nuanced Belgian at a place like this would not lodge the same complaint upon pulling into a roadside place in East Texas.

				Finally went to try out Alchemy... It was phenomenal! Honestly, some of the best brisket I have had, and possibly the best in NYC. Also enjoyed the prime rib, pork ribs, sausage, and wings. Sides were decent as well. The cole slaw was really tangy and cut the richness of all the meat really well. The beans weren&#039;t your typical, sweet, baked beans, they were savory with no sauce to speak of, almost a bean mash. Very tasty. We were given some prime rib chili to bring home and try, so looking forward to a taste of that today.<br /><br />Ron, the chef, is very enthusiastic about the food he is making here, and really eager to build a solid customer base. He is really embracing the neighborhood, and wants to try lots of new recipes that appeal to and reflect the diversity found in JH. He&#039;ll be experimenting more with sides as well. In general, it sounds like he&#039;ll be testing out more new recipes on the weeknights, so if you want to be the guinea pig (which, based on all the samples he had us try last night, is a good thing), that&#039;s when to go. <br /><br />He also mentioned that their regular hours will be Tuesday-Thursday 6-10; Friday-Saturday 6-11; and Sunday 12-5; closed Mondays. For take-out, you can call in orders and pick them up for now; they hope to be delivering soon, as well as on Seamless and/or GrubHub.<br /><br />This is such an awesome addition to the neighborhood, and I really couldn&#039;t be happier about it!

				I went to Alchemy yesterday.<br /><br />The owner is a complete sweetheart, wants to be part of the neighborhood, and seems to be full of ideas and friendliness. I want to make it clear that the whole staff are real assets and were great people when I was talking to them.<br /><br />But the food ... meh. Maybe part of my downer is that I can&#039;t have any of the sauces because of my damn celiac damn disease dammit, but I had the brisket and it was ... eh. Moist, but blandish. They didn&#039;t have any of the pulled-anything that I so loved at Ranger, just brisket and ribs. I had a sweet potato side, and it was whipped sweet potatoes. I went all neurotic about the gluten free, and they gave me Texas toast too. (That is not gluten free.) I don&#039;t hold the Texas toast against them because nobody should have to monitor this gluten free insanity, but the other food was just ... boring.<br /><br />Everything was serviceable, but a bit expensive, and I probably won&#039;t repeat; that&#039;s a pity, because I love barbecue (or I guess I did, before my diagnosis.) Whatever.

				Had my first taste of the new bqq, half pound of brisket and pork and beans. I have to say, I probably wouldn&#039;t order the brisket again. It was too fatty and a bit chewy. The flavor was okay but had a lot of pepper. The pork and beans were very different with a lot of pepper, but I did like them. The lone sauce was a strange choice for your only sauce, again very peppery. For the price ($16), it was not worth it. For that kind of money you should at least get a couple of sides. They need to expand the menu with some cheaper sandwich options. As it is right now, everything is by the pound and a meal will run you $15. I do want to try their ribs before passing judgment.

				taste isn&#039;t a matter of right or wrong, so there&#039;s no sensible way to say &#039;no, really, that brisket was awesome&#039; (which was my thought). you may have gotten a bad plate, and it sounds like you don&#039;t care for the recipes they use for their sides, which is fair enough.<br />but in terms of cost, i don&#039;t think you can find any legit, good quality bbq (not fast food places like the Dallas chain) for much less than what Alchemy charges. John Brown, their LIC location, is about the same, places like Hill Country and Mighty Quinn&#039;s a few bucks more on average.

				I&#039;d agree with dssjh on the brisket, although everyone&#039;s taste is different, and I&#039;m certain I prefer the fatty end of the brisket, which is what I got the other night. And I thought the cost was commensurate with the quality of food and service I got, but that is probably subjective as well.<br /><br />As for expanding the menu to include sandwiches, just ask... There is free white bread with every order. Depending on how hungry you are, I&#039;d say 1/4-1/3 lb. of any of the boneless meats would make a great sandwich, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;d even prepare it on the bread for you. And, if there is a protein that you want to see that they haven&#039;t had yet, again, just ask. The menu is a big experiment, but they want to please those who might be frequent customers too, so if you want pulled pork, it&#039;s worth a mention to the chef. If he hears it enough, I&#039;d bet we&#039;ll start seeing it show up here and there.<br /><br />Now, the facebook page says they&#039;ll have lamb belly tonight. I&#039;m intrigued enough to go give it a shot... Will report back!

				I definately wasn&#039;t going to write them off after this one time.<br /><br />And I did like the side of pork and beans. On it&#039;s own it was very good. Large chucks of pork, spicy pepper flavor and unique. It&#039;s just combined with the large amounts of pepper in the sauce and brisket rub, it was too much.<br /><br />And the brisket wasn&#039;t marbled fatty, it was big chunks of fat. A few of the pieces I got were half meat, and then a large layer of fat on the outside. I got a corner piece that was all fat. It just looked like they didn&#039;t trim the fat cap before smoking.<br /><br />I guess I should of said something, but I&#039;m not like that. What I got wasn&#039;t worth the money.

				&nbsp; First off, we&#039;re thrilled to have them so nearby. Then we ventured slowly into the waters with some chicken<br />and the beef ribs. Both tasty! But different from the BBQ that we know with more peppery smokey denser<br />flavors. The plan now is to work through the menu before settling on a regulars type of order.

				We&#039;ve gone 3 times now and it gets better every time - I think they are just getting used to the equipment and the setup of their new place.&nbsp; I tried the beef rib, which was too chewy for me, and the sausage, which I was hoping to be like the kielbasa that I have had in Texas bbq places, but it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; The pork ribs were really good, juicy and tender, and the brisket is great, better than they do it at John Brown.&nbsp; <br /><br />Re sandwiches: they were making a brisket sandwich on a roll for someone last night when we were there - just ask them and I&#039;m sure they will do what they can.

				well, jeff, we all know that yelp can be kinda ridiculous sometimes. a dozen or so one-star reviews for 11 madison square park, including at least two saying it was the worst restaurant the reviewer had ever been to -- and a slew of horrible reviews for john brown, hill country and the other top bbq places in town.

				We&#039;ve been twice now - once on a Friday, and once on a Wednesday for take-out. We&#039;ve sampled everything but the chicken at this point, and haven&#039;t really had a bad bite of food. The beef ribs are tougher than one would expect of BBQ, but by no means inedible, and that is the nature of the beast, in my experience. The brisket was excellent (we got it both times), the pork ribs great, the sausage nice and moist, the prime rib and lamb belly both tender and delicious. <br /><br />I think the negative reviews come down to a matter of taste, honestly. I prefer a dry-rubbed, smoky BBQ; I rarely use sauce; I like fatty cuts. If someone is used to a leaner cut drenched in sauce, they&#039;re probably going to take issue with the style of BBQ served here. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible, too, that there have been cuts here and there that miss the mark (I haven&#039;t had any, but it&#039;s possible), but I&#039;d be shocked if the chef didn&#039;t replace any piece of meat that was deemed unsatisfactory. He seems to take a lot of pride in what he does, and I imagine he&#039;d be as disappointed as you to find he served a sub-par piece of meat.

				Alchemy was chosen as one of the best new BBQ restaurants by TimeOut New York:<br /><br />&quot;The meat-peddling counter at the back of Legends Sports Bar—once home to Pearson’s and Ranger Texas Barbecue—changed hands yet again in April. Its newest iteration is a smoke lab helmed by Josh Bowen of John Brown Smokehouse. The Queens pit master nods to his Hill Country training with Lone Star State standards, reimagining the usual salt-and-pepper rub with fenugreek, guajillo and pasilla chilies. He pulls offbeat creations from a J&amp;R smoker: beef ribs ($28/lb) mopped with foie gras vinegar; pork-and-beef sausage laced with fiery paprika ($9/lb). But you can also find traditional bites, like moist pork ribs ($12/lb). Cap-wearing teens and local businessmen tackle the mounds of meat at red-and-white-checked tables, moaning or cheering at games playing on hi-def TVs. Even if your team doesn’t win, Bowen’s jazzed-up Texan goods certainly score.71-04 35th Ave between 71st and 72nd Sts, Jackson Heights, Queens (718-803-8244, facebook.com/alchemytexasbbq‎)&quot;—Patty Lee<br /><br />http://www.timeout.com/newyork/food-drink/best-new-bbq-restaurants-nycs-top-smokehouses<br /><br />(http://media.timeout.com/images/resizeBestFit/100689827/660/370/image.jpg)

				On SeriousEats:<br /><br />http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/06/alchemy-texas-barbecue-queens-jackson-heights-review.html<br /><br /><strong>Smoke Signals from Jackson Heights at Alchemy, Texas</strong><br />The first thing to notice in your average New York barbecue joint is the design. Earth tones. Distressed wood. Painstaking efforts to make the place feel more casual than its position in the ruthless New York restaurant world would suggest.<br /><br />That&#039;s not the case at Alchemy, Texas, a barbecue joint in the back of an old man sports bar in Jackson Heights. The wood&#039;s been there for a while. So have the balding men drinking at the bar. I get the impression that the plastic red-checker tablecloths were bought to fancy up the place.<br /><br />And the &#039;cue? On a good day, it&#039;s up there with some of New York&#039;s great smoked meat. On other days it disappoints. As the two-month-old spot settles into a groove with its customers and works through the quirks of its smoker, that success seems likely to improve. In the meantime, go early in the evening. And spring for the beef. (click link for full article)<br /><br />(http://newyork.seriouseats.com/assets_c/2013/06/20130604-alchemy-texas-primary-thumb-500xauto-330805.jpg)

				I&#039;ve been back a couple times, first with the beef ribs and then another try at the brisket. The brisket was better this time, but strangely the rub wasn&#039;t as aggressive...almost swinging to the other side of the spectrum more than I would’ve liked. For sides I had the coleslaw, which was excellent. It was more of a vinegary, tangy style with no mayonnaise. The Mac N Cheese grew on me, to where I thought it was pretty decent. It’s not the real rue-based baked variety that I prefer, but it had a more interesting cheese flavor that the standard Velveeta based style. I&#039;ll probably frequent once every couple weeks at least because I really want this option to stick around in the neighborhood.

				The article perfectly describes the need for YOU to go, and it gives you an excuse to invite your friends over to the neighborhood.&nbsp; The place is totally up and down, but&nbsp; <strong>&quot;if we want Alchemy to improve its quality and consistency, we owe it our patronage.&quot; </strong><br /><br />you can&#039;t just sit back and expect people to love your neighborhood.

				We finally made it here this past Friday evening and loved it! Some of the best chicken I&#039;ve ever had. The pork ribs were great too. My wife is not a huge fan of duck, but even she gobbled it up at Alchemy. While &quot;vinegary cabbage salad&quot; is a better descriptor of the coleslaw, the tang and crunch were a really nice balance to all the meaty, fatty goodness. The creamed spinach was also really great, though a bit heavy for me within the context of the rest of the meal. <br /><br />We&#039;re lucky to have this place in the neighborhood. We&#039;ll most certainly make return trips. And really, I can&#039;t say enough about the half chicken - it was amazing!

				I also tried it this weekend for the first time and loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I found it very interesting how different the food tasted from both Ranger and Pearson&#039;s, given that they all used the same smoker.&nbsp; Alchemy uses delicious and very peppery rubs, and the meat tastes less smoky than Pearson&#039;s did.&nbsp; The chicken was the best I&#039;ve had anywhere, and the pork ribs were delicious too.&nbsp; I still need to return to try the brisket.<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope they continue to experiment with the sides... they could use some more work.&nbsp; (I&#039;d certainly prefer collards over creamed spinach)<br /><br />

				Glad to hear Alchemy is picking up steam. A friend of mine dropped in last week and was chatting with Drew, the gentleman that mans the smoker and carves the meat. According to him, he&#039;s being relocated soon to John Brown in LIC, and his replacement at Alchemy will be Josh Bowen himself. If true, this could be mean an even better menu (and if we&#039;re lucky, some new sides too)!!

				I had made two failed attempts to try Alchemy out after they opened (Once I was there too early, not realizing that they were not open for lunch. The second time, the smoker was broken). Finally, a few weekends ago I was able to try their BBQ. I went around 7:00PM and I found a nice sized crowd of both people that were there to dine as well as those that were there to drink. I had the brisket and pork ribs and both were amazing! Alchemy definitely desrves all of the great reviews it has been receiving. I will definitely be bringing some friends along the next time I go.

				Made to Alchemy this week and it does deserve all the raves.&nbsp; Had the BBQ brisket, chicken, and duck.&nbsp; All delicious.<br />The sauce was great--on the spicy side.&nbsp; Both side dishes were great--especially the meaty baked beans.&nbsp; Everyone I was with left content.&nbsp; Bar was busier than the restaurant, but expect this to do well.&nbsp; The Stella was crisp and served in cold glass...perfect with the meal.&nbsp; Spent some time in Texas, Arkansas, and KC last year...and this was every bit as good as the barbecue I had out there.&nbsp; Great addition to Jackson Heights.

				I tried it out over the weekend. Had Brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs. Friends had brisket and Chicken. Sides were creamed spinach and potato salad.<br /><br />The brisket and pork ribs were excellent. I also really dug the creamed spinach and potato salad. The beef ribs were just OK, I think I&#039;m just more of a pork rib fan. Everyone liked their stuff and we agreed a return trip will be in order. Seems like it would be a good place to watch some football on sunday when the season kicks back up.

I was annoyed last time I asked for a half pound of pork ribs, they gave me three ribs which seemed like a lot. I thought they were just being nice and it was a bonus rib, but when I went to pay they charged me more than a half pound. Turns out two ribs was just below a half pound, and adding another rib cost me something like $5 more. They should of at least told me this before they put the extra rib on there.

				When I leave the neighborhood, it is not uncommon for me to spend around or over $20 for a meal. I don&#039;t know why people are complaining, you&#039;ve been wanting this type of class of food in the area for a long time. (I know it may be hard to believe BBQ can be in a higher class, but it is (same problem but to a lesser extent with people selling Chinese food))<br /><br />We are very lucky that Pearson&#039;s set up here 20 years ago and left that giant smoker or else Alchemy would never have come. This is not a neighborhood that a consultant would recommend putting a higher end American food place --- You can either agree and protest b/c you are spending Carroll Gardens prices, or prove them wrong and see the neighborhood get better.

				Finally made the four-block hike to Alchemy last night and just caught them before closing (Yelp said 10pm, but apparently it&#039;s 8pm on Sundays). They were out of most items and all ribs but my wife and I split a pound of brisket that I mightily enjoyed. I want the place to thrive. I&#039;ll certainly be back on the earlier side to catch some ribs and frog legs.

				yeah definitely - you shouldn&#039;t pay that much for something you don&#039;t like. Go as early as possible and you&#039;ll get the freshest stuff - 6pm they open.

				Finally got around to visiting Alchemy tonight. Got there around 7pm and ordered beef ribs &amp; some cole slaw to go. Enjoyed a cold beer and got to sample my order. Very nice people behind the counter and we discussed the sister restaurant John Browns in LIC which i&#039;ve been to. The ribs at John Browns are Kansas city style, vs Texas style at Alchemy. I let them heat up in my oven for an hour at 200 degree&#039;s and turned off the oven after 20 min. Very good flavor and tender meat on the thicker ribs.

				I&#039;m going to take a guess here.<br /><br />It&#039;s about demographics.<br /><br />My guess is that immigrants here in JH most often like to eat in their own cultural restaurants.<br /><br />Non immigrants in Jax Heights are often couples with young families who mostly I imagine order in...or cook!...or go to diners where there are kiddie friendly meals.<br /><br />The population of young or older couples and singles who might frequent this establishment...is here...but not in the numbers that exist in NYC elsewhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jax Hts was built for families.&nbsp; And continues, I believe, to serve that function.<br /><br />And so the market for an establishment like this just may be kinda limited in Jax Hts.<br /><br />Not that it isn&#039;t appreciated. Just that the population who might frequent it... may simply not be here...and so the buzz isn&#039;t there. <br /><br />And then there&#039;s the vegetarians....like me...who are no help at all.

				I know that Alchemy has been mentioned in some online mags and blogs, and seriously talked about on this forum, but do the owners do any advertising other than that? why not in Metro or Boro mag, or even local neighborhood ads?&nbsp; If you dont read the posts on this website, or come by those few restaurant reviews, how would anybody really know they are there?&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t, and I only live 3 blocks away from it! I feel like its a problem of marketing, i really don&#039;t think its a cultural thing.&nbsp; I would venture to say there are tons of meat-eaters in these many many co-ops and residences that would love to know about this place.&nbsp; Why not have a friday or Saturday specials, or coupons or anything to entice people to come in?&nbsp; I think it would be likely to drum up business.&nbsp; &nbsp;and a website people!!&nbsp; (not just a facebook thing) Also, honestly, if you walk by the place, it doesn&#039;t look like anything would be remotely outstanding going on inside...those tarp signs strung onto the awning actually look kind creepy to me (just my opinion, no need for any comments on superficiality of signage).&nbsp; but seriously, if a place looks inviting, people will feel invited.&nbsp; and thats my two cents :)&nbsp;

				I think all these things are a factor.&nbsp; Demographics, advertising, signage, etc.&nbsp; I think its location off the beaten path as well as in the back of a bar not known for the sprightliest of clientelle (don&#039;t get me wrong, i like it, but hip it is not).&nbsp; If you go to astoria, which is a neighborhood more suited to foodies interested in this type of cuisine, there are three bbq places, not to mention the strand, a block long giant with indoor and outdoor seating and live music.&nbsp; I just dont know what would draw out of towners (except die hard bbq lovers).

				Also I might point out that while we were there the bar crowd consisted of six men, none of whom ordered food while I was there.&nbsp; Maybe if Alchemy included, like its predecessor, a pulled pork or bbq chicken sandwich (they did have a burger for $10)for $7 rather than pounds of meat (they do offer quarter or half pounds, but this isn&#039;t advertised) for $25, the built in clientele may be more likely to order food there.&nbsp; Like Jeff alluded to in his semi-controversial &quot;culture clash&quot; comment, it&#039;s improbable to have rented food space in the back of a bar be successful that doesn&#039;t cater to the built in crowd of that bar, at least a little bit.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think demographics are really an issue. This space has served barbecue for at least a decade: they must have been serving food to someone. <br /><br />I agree with ptbass75 about the menu. Fixed-price sandwiches might be more accessible to some than by-the-pound meat. Maybe their menu would be more attractive if it resembled the one at John Brown Smokehouse, where each meat is available as a platter, sandwich, or by-the-pound.

				I think Alchemy is in trouble.&nbsp; They were closed unexpectedly today and won&#039;t reopen until Friday.&nbsp; A similar occurrence happened last week.&nbsp; Potential customers who came in tonight and were told they were closed may never come back.&nbsp; &nbsp;Staffing is one issue but business is&nbsp; also very slow as of late and they need a better business plan.<br /><br />I have been a regular customer of Legends for many years and are friends with many people&nbsp; there and most customers who sit at the bar would love to have a sandwich or burger not a 1/2 lb. of meat.&nbsp; &nbsp;Their menu needs some improvement to capture the people who are already inside and they need some signs or marketing to get people from outside to come inside.&nbsp; I&nbsp; like their food but I don&#039;t see them making it with their current business plan.&nbsp; I hope I am wrong.

				This is sad to read. I&#039;ve enjoyed the food there on several occasions. My wife and I ate there with our infant son in tow. I actually think that on the early side of dinner, the bar is an ideal spot to take a kid. I&#039;ve also stopped in to pick up food to take home. But I have to agree with much of what has been said here. Unless you keep tabs on this site, or read a handful of food sites, there is no way to know that the place exists. Alchemy should do more neighborhood outreach/marketing, like hand out flyers at the Greenmarket that play up the connection to John Brown Smokehouse. <br /><br />The idea about including a couple fixed-price sandwiches on the menu is very smart. <br /><br />And they do need to be consistent. The first time I tried to eat there, they were out of everything we really wanted to try, so we got nothing. If I showed up and the place was closed, I wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to return. <br /><br />It&#039;s only been a few months and no business can really establish itself in such a short amount of time. If they aren&#039;t able to stick it out for at least a year, that&#039;s bad planning on their part. Which is a shame, because the BBQ is excellent and a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp;

My wife and I were regular customers at Texas Ranger - those pulled pork sandwiches were our go-to guilty pleasure.

				The food they had there was excellent and a MASSIVE upgrade over the previous owners&#039; fare (I still shudder at the memory of the soggy, overcooked clumps of cheese-free macaroni from the macaroni-and-cheese out of a box there).<br />Unfortunately, it seemed like they thought merely being there was enough. They never did, to my knowledge, add delivery or accept credit cards and they failed to do things like add sandwiches or, well, not randomly close for a night...or a weekend...or whenever.<br />It was great to have an option for that kind of food without having to leave the neighborhood. It&#039;s a shame that the business and the neighborhood didn&#039;t support each other. Because it should have become a go-to staple.<br />In the meantime, it&#039;s dollars I&#039;ll spend elsewhere because that&#039;s where I&#039;ll have to go to get good barbecue.

				Well, I hope someone else takes up the space, with that smoker already there. Legends has a pretty decent customer base, but fancy $30/meat was out of place. I wasn&#039;t terribly impressed with John Brown&#039;s Smokehouse either; burnt ends very good but pull pork was dry and mac n cheese oily. Of the Q I&#039;ve had here so far, Fette Sau and Mighty Quinn&#039;s were better.

				What I&#039;m pretty sure happened here is that you have a guy who loves making good BBQ that found an awesome smoker and wanted to try something exciting in our hood.&nbsp; Unfortunately, experimental BBQ and Legends bar on 35th Ave were not a match.&nbsp; I remember on one of my visits hearing the &quot;regulars&quot; heckle the menu because it seemed strange to them.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think they were ordering the BBQ Frogs Legs, that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; So, this leaves the owner two choices, either change your business plan to appeal to the regulars and with greater mass appeal or shut down and try somewhere else that might be a better fit.&nbsp; They are choosing the latter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still think Jackson Heights can support a good BBQ place, but at this point there have been three different renters of the smoker at that place and once again it has closed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Working in the restaurant business for 5 years I learned that profits are mostly from booze, not food.&nbsp; <br /><br />It may just not be a sustainable model for a business.&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; Either way, sad to see them go.&nbsp;

				If you haven&#039;t tried Slide BBQ in maspeth, which is close to us (they actually delivered to JH) they aren&#039;t bad at all. The Brisket was good but a little fatty (we happen to favor leaner brisket, I know some people don&#039;t actually.. ) and I got the rib combo and those were really good. The mashed potatoes were good, the beans were also good. The Carolina mustard based bbq sauce tasted like King&#039;s BBQ Sauce we used to buy when I was a kid. So good.<br /><br />Give em a shot.. We&#039;re going to try chicken and ribs next time. The wings also sound good, eager to try those.<br /><br />http://slidebarbqmaspeth.com/

As a side note, I found this interesting: &quot;The restaurant finally opens after a three-year licensing saga with the Department of Buildings. Bowen, whose business partner owns the Dutch Kills building, says that the delay-ridden approval process would have put them out of business before the restaurant opened if he had been leasing the space.&quot; Sounds familiar!

His BBQ is great, but I&#039;ll go elsewhere now. And it should be added the reason he threatened JVB was because of Amazon deciding not to build their 2nd headquarters in LIC. They probably never intended to, despite saying they would.

				Yes, they meant to. Amazon signed an MOU, which they wouldn&#039;t have done if they weren&#039;t serious.
