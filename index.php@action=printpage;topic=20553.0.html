				I know exactly how you feel. Honestly the only silver lining of the pandemic was the end of these terrible, horrible Saturday mornings. Then the moment the city declares it&#039;s reopened it&#039;s like LGA and the FAA are like &quot;wait a minute, we haven&#039;t made the residents of Jackson Heights miserable in a while; better get on that!&quot;<br /><br />But seriously, I&#039;ve never been able to understand the need for this. They claim it&#039;s runway maintenance/renovation; well, haven&#039;t they had a year and a half to do exactly that? Also, even just one more hour of sleep would go a long way towards not completely ruining my entire weekend. The noise seems to have stopped; why couldn&#039;t they have let me sleep until 7 or 8am before jolting me awake like I&#039;m in some kind of war zone?? It is truly psychological torture.<br /><br />On a side note, has anyone found a successful means of getting through this? I turn my AC unit to high and jam earplugs in my ears so deeply I get ear pain. It doesn&#039;t really make any difference.

				to the question of why they&#039;re doing maintenance, runways have it far rougher than roads, which get maintained on a regular basis -- and the workers can&#039;t exactly just slap down a metal plate as a temporary fix.<br /><br />and, having lived here for decades now, and experienced this on and off since almost day one, i can vouch that it sucks every now and then. considering how close we are to LGA, i&#039;m surprised we get the blast as infrequently as we do. <br /><br />for advice on how to handle it, perhaps ask someone in one of the surrounding neighborhoods that deal with the noise 90-plus percent of the year, year in, year out. that&#039;s not sarcasm -- maybe there are sites like this one in the other neighborhoods impacted by LGA.

My bigger problem with the noise is actually not that it wakes me up, but when it continues throughout the day, I start to feel like I can&#039;t take it anymore when it&#039;s every 90 seconds. Today&#039;s must have stopped very early because I never heard it at all. Also I should mention I live in the 80s streets, not the 70s, and it&#039;s not as loud up here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never quite understood why they can&#039;t find some way of alerting the public when they are scheduling this maintenance. Some people might want to plan a day out of the apartment in order to avoid hearing it. Unless it&#039;s due to a sudden weather condition, the runway change is scheduled since it&#039;s scheduled maintenance, not emergency maintenance, as far as I know.

				I think I heard 5 or 6 planes this morning, one right after the other, and then it was done.&nbsp;
