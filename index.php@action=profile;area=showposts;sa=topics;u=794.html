					I am going to post this every few weeks, because I&#039;m not sure when the ideal time is. It&#039;s probably still too early!<br /><br />Just in case someone has relatives or friends who might be interested in coming for an extended stay I thought it was worth mentioning our sublet.<br /><br />I have a fellowship that will take us abroad for 8 months.<br /><br />We have a modest 1 bedroom coop -- i.e., no garden or granite counter tops! But it&#039;s convenient (81st and 37th) and quiet (faces the back of the building). We would be willing to give it for a reduced rent for someone who is responsible, known to someone in the neighborhood and who would be willing to keep an eye out for important mail. ($1100 or so, unless you need us to completely -- as opposed to partially -- empty it.)<br /><br />The apartment will be available from about May 23 to Jan 20. (Exact dates TBD -- but we will know for sure in about 6 weeks.)<br /><br />I will re-post closer to the time, of course. But I know I would&#039;ve jumped at something like this last year when my Dad was contemplating an extended visit from India, so I thought, why not put it out there now?<br />

					I&#039;ve been going to Manhattan to an origami meet-up where people just fold together. It is very relaxed -- no formal teaching, just lots of friendly exchanges of information, and folders of all levels from total beginners to professionals, from kids to the retired and everyone between.<br /><br />However, I don&#039;t always want to get on the subway. I have recently met several other people in JH who like to fold, and it occurs to us that maybe we need a local meet-up!<br /><br />We are thinking about starting with one Saturday afternoon per month.<br /><br />The big question is location. If there are just a handful of us, we could meet at one of the usual cafes. <br /><br />If you think you might come on occasion, if you can think of a good place to meet, or if you are connected to a business that would welcome folders, send me an email offlist.<br /><br />thanks!<br />

					I was awarded a Fulbright to study the mathematical thinking of expert kolam-makers in Tamil Nadu. (If you can help me, you most likely know what what a kolam is!) <br /><br />I will be starting the project in about a year.<br /><br />Before then I would like to work on spoken Tamil. I will have a collaborator/translator in Chennai, but to do a creditable job I need to be able to understand the gist of what is being said.<br /><br />I was able to converse about daily life 10 years ago, but have since forgotten all but a few words. So I have to start over.<br /><br />I can pay, or else help you and/or your kids with math -- either enrichment or tutoring for school. <br /><br />In particular, since you are presumably interested in things Tamil, you might be interested in the series of math activities I have created that use kolams. I have given many workshops on this material (mostly to K-12 teachers &amp; students, but also to students at the college level) both in Chennai (sponsered by the Math Sciences Institute) and in the U.S. (sponsored by various university Math/Asian Studies departments and/or school districts).<br /><br />ciao,<br /><br />Sunita<br />

					I have seen news reports that the city is going to start collecting other plastics besides the jugs and bottles currently on the list. But a quick perusal of the official recycling website didn&#039;t yield any more information -- in fact, it still says they have no plans to expand plastic recycling. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/resources/plastics_nyc_add.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/resources/plastics_nyc_add.shtml</a><br /><br />Is there anyone else who is frustrated at not being able to recycle their yogurt containers, take-out containers, etc.? I&#039;ve cut way back on what I buy, but haven&#039;t been able to rid myself of them completely.<br /><br />I saw that Whole Foods collects them for Gimme5, and I have a fantasy of doing a mini-recycling program with neighbors -- take turns taking them into the city every few weeks. Of course that would only work if it was just a few people, in which case, one might ask, what is the point?

					Hi folks --<br /><br />I have started a group reading project: Joyce&#039;s Ulysses. We meet for about an hour and take turns reading out loud to each other, stopping to discuss when inspired to do so.<br /><br />The second meeting is Monday 9/13: arrive at 7 pm, start reading at 7:15, finish by 8:15. Approx. location is 81st and 37th. (And yes, you should try to bring a copy of the book if you can get it in time.)<br /><br />Email me offlist if you want to join us, want more details before you decide, etc.<br /><br />FYI -- We are still debating the virtues of Mondays vs. Wednesdays, every week vs. every other week. Final decisions TBA.<br /><br />ciao<br />Sunita<br />

					I always had cats growing up, but my husband is very allergic.<br /><br />He grew up with dogs, and so we have been thinking for a few years about getting a dog. We&#039;ve hesitated so far because we know that dogs don&#039;t like being left even for a few days, and we tend to take frequent short trips out of town, and every couple of years we go to India for 3-4 weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking of the possibility of sharing custody with another person/family. That would solve our problem, but I am wondering about the effect on the dog.<br /><br />Does anyone know enough about dogs to know how adaptable they are -- i.e. if they had 2 loving homes instead of one, would that be likely to cause confusion/problems?<br /><br />thanks in advance for advice!<br /><br /><br />

					<br /><br />I just heard that there is a warehouse available on 37th Ave. and 58th St. (just about 1 mile down from Espresso 77).&nbsp; It is 5500 square feet, and the rent is $6500/month. I haven&#039;t seen it yet, but the other person who is looking for space with me has, and he says it looks like it has a lot of potential.<br /><br />If there is anyone out there who is interested in sharing space who hasn&#039;t responded yet? We don&#039;t have enough people yet to fill such a large space, but I am still hopeful that there are more of you out there who might be interested.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					A few neighborhood artists have been talking about/looking around for space for a few months, and now that the artist community is starting to get organized (thanks Deb!) we are moving forward on our dream of finding some shared studio within walking distance of Jackson Heights. <br /><br />At the meeting last week we talked about using the space to provide a gathering place for local artists whether or not you have your studio there.<br /><br />We hope to find an unfinished space with a long lease that has heat, water, ventilation, a freight elevator and 24/7 access. Light would also be a plus obviously.<br /><br />Here are some ideas, <span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">and some questions for you</span>, if you are interested in being part of our studio or community. I know itâ€™s a lot of questions! But the more you tell us, the better able we will be to meet the needs of as many people as possible.<br /><br />Question: is there some way for folks to answer privately?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Idea #1 â€“ Private studio vs. Shared Space vs. a combination of both</span><br /><br />The studio I am leaving (too far away!) has a combination of private studios and an open/shared studio space. It works well for us, because some people come in less often and don&#039;t need to leave their work lying around. They pay less to come and work in a shared space. Others have their own private space that they can use how they like (except for toxic fumes and loud music that might disturb their neighbors). <br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">So question #1</span> -- would you want your own personal space for you to set up&nbsp; and furnish as you like, or would you prefer a lower priced option of shared workspace, with the additional option of renting a storage area for your tools and works in progress? <br /><br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Idea #2 â€“ Different types of artistsâ€™ studios + meeting space?</span><br /><br />* A few people posted on JHFamilies saying they would like to share a darkroom.<br />* several folks at the meeting on Sept 13 were print-makers<br />* I am planning to have a kiln and wheel at minimum, and other ceramics equipment (slab roller? extruder?) if there are others interested in sharing costs. <br />* There was talk at the meeting about having some kind of shared meeting/performance space -- which we could use ourselves for art shows, concerts, meetings and rent out for others in the neighborhood to use for the same purpose.<br />* We could include writers in the neighborhood -- I know of spaces in Manhattan where writers can sign up for blocks of time to get away from their families (!) and do some serious work.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">So group of questions #2 -- </span><br />What is your artform? <br />What kind of equipment do you need? <br />Are you willing to share any of it or are you willing to share costs with others who need the same equipment?<br />Are you willing to be the point person/organizer for the shared space for your art form?<br /><br />If you donâ€™t want to be a â€œregularâ€ (i.e. rent space, or pay for more limited access to shared equipment/space) do you think a meeting/exhibition/performance space is needed in the neighborhood?<br />Would you avail yourself of it?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: maroon;" class="bbc_color">Issue #3 â€“ cost!</span><br /><br />We were told commercial rents are less than $2/square foot, and that we can probably find a place for significantly less than that. But remember, that includes the hallways, the bathroom, the interior wallsâ€¦ AND our share of the hallways, etc. for the whole building. <span style="color: maroon;" class="bbc_color">So the per square foot cost of your actual studio will be higher than the listed price!</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: maroon;" class="bbc_color">Group of Question #3 </span><br /><br />What is your minimum space requirement? <br /><br />What is the upper limit of your budget? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />(You would need to come up with a deposit + brokerâ€™s fee of 2-3 monthâ€™s rent as well as your first monthâ€™s rent right at the start. We are hoping for the lower amount, but it will depend on the landlord.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Any issues that are important to you that we havenâ€™t thought of yet?</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Your commitment level:</span><br />(Circle one)<br /><br />Interested&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very Interested&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checkbook at the ready<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Name:</span><br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">How to reach you (email and/or phone):</span><br /><br />
