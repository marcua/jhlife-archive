			Have you ever picked up used furniture from the street that has been discarded as trash?&nbsp; It is a great way to get used furniture for free. I picked up a computer table, wooden cart, wooden chairs, wooden table, and drawer.&nbsp; I use Lysol disinfectant spray to clean them first.

			Be aware that this neighborhood has a bed bug problem. Lysol won&#039;t kill them. <br />Free furniture probably isn&#039;t worth the risk.

			I don&#039;t pick up mattresses or sofas or anything like that.&nbsp; I only pick up hard wood tables, or metallic carts.&nbsp; I am using a metallic cart as a shoe rack.

			Just to clarify, this CITY has a huge problem with them.<br />In regards to what type of furniture you pick up:<br />They can hide anywhere a business card can fit, so<br />you won&#039;t necessarily see them. And they can be <br />on any type furniture.

			Actually, every major city and many smaller cities are now having problems with them as well.&nbsp; Add to that some dormitories at colleges, hotels, public schools, nursing homes, etc.&nbsp; In NYC I believe there has not been a major education campaign because of the issue of the number of tourist dollars potentially being lost if people think they will have to deal with them if they visit here.<br /><br />But one of the top things that should be in an education campaign (if there ever is one) would be not to trash-pick furniture.&nbsp; Those days are over, at least until a better pesticide can be found.&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s still possible to pick things from the trash and not get bedbugs, but I agree with cybgrand - it isn&#039;t worth the risk to you or to your neighbors.
