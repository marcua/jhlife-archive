				Two requests. I was wondering if anyone had a recommendation for a garden landscaper who would be able to repave a patio and path as well as build a base for a fountain. Not so much interested in having someone do planting. I know that Fillmore Hall just recently did their garden and it looks great. Someone had told me that there is a guy who lives in the building that also does this kind of work.<br /><br />Secondly, I currently use Milliar as my gardener to do the weekly grass cutting and property clean up. Although they are reliable, I was wondering if anyone has someone better.

				The company that just did the Belvedere did a beautiful job on the hardscape but I don&#039;t live there and cannot recommend. Maybe someone will post that info. <br /><br />I use Turf &amp; Garden for landscaping and patio work. They did a great job with pavers.&nbsp; The owner&#039;s name is Bob Orestano 718-746-8873.

				I was wondering if someone could recommend a gardener/landscaper who does work in Jackson Heights. I&#039;ve heard the name Millimar, but was hoping for more than just one to choose from.
