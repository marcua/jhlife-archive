				LIC and Astoria - particularly Queensbridge and Ravenswood -- skew this dramatically. most of the murders and a lot of the most violent crimes happen in those confines. <br /><br />lower crime rates, across the board, of course, would be good.

				According to https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/find-your-precinct.page, the area that most people would consider Jackson Heights is really in the 115th Precinct, not the 114th Precinct. So the article seems misleading.

				The crime stats are just as bad, for the most part, in the 115th pct.
