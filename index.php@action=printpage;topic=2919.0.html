				I&#039;m looking for a place nearby that serves good brunch... preferably like the places in Manhattan with food and all-you-can-drink mimosas for $10-$15... does this exist in JH?&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it does in Astoria, but I wouldn&#039;t want to drink and drive, and the subway trip to Astoria is more of a hassle than the subway trip to Manhattan..&nbsp; So, anywhere within walking distance?

				I saw a sign for brunch recently at Armondos... can&#039;t say if they have all you can drink mimosas, but it could be what you&#039;re looking for. 75th and 37th ave

				Armondo&#039;s claims to have a brunch, but I&#039;ve never tried it, and I&#039;m not sure if it has booze. (cross-posted with sb103)<br /><br />For a not-horrible subway ride there&#039;s Dillinger&#039;s in the Astoria/Woodside area, on 30th Avenue and 49th (I think) Street. You can take the R/V/G (is the G still running?) to 46th Street and it&#039;s a short walk (or it takes about a half an hour from 34th and 80th if you want to actually walk- I hop-stopped nearby yesterday, and that&#039;s what it suggested). On sunday only they have an all you can drink prix fixe brunch, 11:30-2:30 (http://www.dillingersny.com/brunch.htm)<br /><br />I bet some of the bars in Woodside have brunch, but I&#039;ve never tried. You can look here (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/507544) and see if anything strikes your fancy. <br /><br />Good luck! That&#039;s the thing I miss the most about Astoria- brunch!

				You could try La Flor in Woodside.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been, but I know many people like it for brunch.<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-flor-bakery-and-cafe-woodside

				the r into astoria is actually quite simple from roosevelt...7-10 minutes perhaps? blackstone&#039;s on bway just off steinway is nice and i am sure that intersection has many other options (lived there until i moved to JH&nbsp; in 1997). the 46 st stop is closer but probably a little less likely.....will see if i can rustle up another option or two<br /><br />and fwiw armondo&#039;s brunch is nice and does have booze. not all you can drink....that&#039;s a concept pretty much limited to manhattan and the parts of brooklyn that like to pretend they are in manhattan....but a solid bloody mary for sure<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2919.msg19399#msg19399">Quote from: C11106 on June 15, 2009, 03:47:36 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m looking for a place nearby that serves good brunch... preferably like the places in Manhattan with food and all-you-can-drink mimosas for $10-$15... does this exist in JH?&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it does in Astoria, but I wouldn&#039;t want to drink and drive, and the subway trip to Astoria is more of a hassle than the subway trip to Manhattan..&nbsp; So, anywhere within walking distance?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				We had Brunch at Novo today. For $13.95, you get bottom less coffee and a complimentary drink and a main course. It is definitely worth a try. Please let me know what you think.<br /><br />Take care,<br />Ryan

				Tried the brunch at Novo today. &nbsp;I can&#039;t remember all the offerings from the brunch menu...maybe someone else can fill in the gap here if they&#039;ve been. &nbsp;Anyway, my order was $13.95 and it included a beverage (coffee, tea or juice), I believe a drink such as a mimosa, eggs cooked any style, bacon, home fries and two wedges of toasted ciabatta bread. &nbsp;It was very nice and quite different from the typical coffee shop/diner style breakfast/brunch. &nbsp;A small basket of mini scones was also included.&nbsp; Portion size was generous too.

				I had three brunches at Cavalier at 85th &amp; 37th Ave the last being well over a year ago and enjoyed all three.&nbsp; I had steak, eggs &amp; potatoes with a drink and coffee for $11.95 but it could be more now.&nbsp; I had a vodka &amp; orange juice as a drink and it was strong so they didn&#039;t skimp on the liquor.&nbsp; I had a beer for a second drink.&nbsp; It came to about $20 with tax &amp; tip.&nbsp; Excellent service &amp; atmosphere.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Wow!&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many posts for brunch places on this thread, so I&#039;m adding one of my favorite spots located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn...&nbsp; a hop, skip and a jump away by car.<br /><br /><strong>Cafecito BogotÃ¡</strong><br />1015 Manhattan Ave<br />(between Green St &amp; Huron St)<br />Brooklyn, NY 11222<br />(718) 569-0077<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to Cafecito BogotÃ¡ a few times with my husband and friends, and have enjoyed both the brunch and dinner selections.&nbsp; Their Colombian brunch is served on weekends from 9:00 am - 6:00 pm, so late birds don&#039;t miss out!&nbsp; It&#039;s my favorite spot for tender and moist arepas con queso or montadas, huevos pericos, jugos naturales and other traditional Colombian favorites.&nbsp; The owners and staff are super friendly.&nbsp; Pleasant, unpretentious ambiance, fresh ingredients, vegetarian options and nice wine selection too!&nbsp; Check them out for breakfast, lunch or dinner when in that area.<br /><br />Check out Cafecito&#039;s website and menu at:<br /><br />Cafecito BogotÃ¡ (http://www.cafecitobogota.com/)

				I agree - this place is great. (Plus, one of the owners lives in Jackson Heights).<br /><br />Their website seems to be down right now, but you can follow them on Facebook here: http://www.facebook.com/cafecito.bogota or on twitter at: http://twitter.com/cafecitobogota<br /><br />**EDIT** their website is back up, so never-mind. But I still highly recommend them!
