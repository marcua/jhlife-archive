					I live in the 90th St/Elmhurst section of JH and I&#039;ve seen them come around numerous times in the past 4 years that I&#039;ve lived here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen them multiple times this year, and in fact, they just came to my apt this evening.&nbsp; Tonight was the worst instance in that there were 4 of them(!) at my door - all of them looked about 16 yrs old.&nbsp; They asked if I have certain verbiage on my electric bill, to which I responded no because I didn&#039;t care, was hoping they would leave quickly, and I already knew this was a scam.&nbsp; They then responded that since I didn&#039;t have it on my current bill, it meant I didn&#039;t have a service provider (huh??).&nbsp; They asked to see the bill and claimed they could save me money.&nbsp; Needless to say I did not show them anything and declined their offer.&nbsp; Ridiculous that these people are getting into the building so frequently and that there are KIDS involved in this scam!&nbsp; <br /><br />This has happened one too many times now.&nbsp; Next time I will tell them that I know this is a scam and that unless they can prove otherwise, I will call the police if they do not immediately leave the building.&nbsp; I suggest that everyone else do the same.

					Purchase it online at Bunnybale!&nbsp; It&#039;s the ONLY thing I use for my lionhead rabbits.&nbsp; It is better quality than anything you can get at a pet store and your bunnies will seriously love it.&nbsp; It is greener and it doesn&#039;t shatter as easily.&nbsp; It is supposedly healthier for your buns as well since it is so fresh (it&#039;s straight from a farm!)&nbsp; It is ultimately also cheaper than getting int he store because it comes in bulk.&nbsp; If you have indoor only rabbits, go with the Timothy Hay variety - it has less calories for your bun.&nbsp; If your bunny is very very active or an outdoor rabbit, then use the Alfalfa variety.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bunnybale.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bunnybale.com/</a><br /><br />If you totally run out of hay and can&#039;t get bunnybale in time or you just don&#039;t like bunnybale for some reason, then I&#039;d go with the Oxbow brand...but it&#039;s quality still isn&#039;t as good as Bunnybale and it will ultimately cost you more in the long run.<br /><br />I have also used Kaytee brand in the past, but it is largely less desirable...the quality just isn&#039;t there...and it shatters everywhere (meaning it breaks into a million pieces and your buns tend not to eat those as much - that means you are wasting money).

					I used to have 2 bunnies.&nbsp; If you want your bunny to lose weight, you don&#039;t necessarily have to take him for walks outside.&nbsp; You can just create a pen for your bunny to run around in for a little bit each day.&nbsp; Also be mindful of your bunny&#039;s temperament when taking him outside, you wouldn&#039;t want to make him too nervous (unless he&#039;s used to the outside).&nbsp; But otherwise...it&#039;d be really cute to take your bunny for a walk.&nbsp; Just be sure you have the proper harness/leash for him.

					I must also comment on Dr. Cesar Tello.&nbsp; I think he is FANTASTIC.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t think Noah&#039;s Ark Pet Clinic is particularly cheap, I also don&#039;t think it is overpriced - especially for the kind of service they provide.&nbsp; Dr. Tello ALWAYS spends ample time talking with me when i bring in my 2 cats.&nbsp; He answers all of my questions and is really helpful - even to the point of explaining specifics about diagnosis, etc (he always likes to show examples of things in medical books, which is helpful and is reassuring to me that he knows his stuff).&nbsp; And it also doesn&#039;t hurt that he has an ivy league degree from Cornell. <br /><br />The facilities, while perhaps are rather small, are still kept very clean.&nbsp; The staff is very pleasant and accommodating and they almost ALWAYS follow up with me by phone to see if my cats are responding well to medication, treatments, etc.&nbsp; They also are very good at reminding me of necessary vaccines and check-ups that are coming up (which some could view as being a money-making strategy for them...but nevertheless, I find it helpful).<br /><br />I really can&#039;t say enough good things about them...you can&#039;t put a price on having a really smart vet who is good at diagnosing problems and truly cares about your pets.
