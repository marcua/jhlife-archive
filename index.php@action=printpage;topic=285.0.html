				Just curious. Very little has been said anywhere about a reletively new place called cafe 89 on Northern Blvd next to CVS. I&#039;ve gone in there for breakfast many times, and found it pretty decent. It&#039;s always full in the morning as well. I believe the owners are South American, however the menu is very Greek diner/American Style (for a lack of a better way to phrase it) I think they also throw some South American dishes in for diner. Never went there past breakfast though. Interesting because they have the Maya Cafe (formerly known as El Rancho) that has some Mexican style dishes as well as typical diner food in the same basic location. I wonder if that&#039;s a trend in the area. I&#039;d also like to say that Maya/El Rancho is another favorite breakfast place for me. I like these combinations. I think it is what makes Jackson Heights very unique. <br /><br />

				I had a wrap at Cafe 89 this past weekend.&nbsp; It was pretty good flavor wise, but I have to say that the people that work there are super friendly.&nbsp; While I was waiting for my order, the girl behind the counter offered me a free cup of coffee.&nbsp; Great customer service and decent chow.&nbsp; I would definitely go back

				The answer to this question may be obvious, but is Cafe 89 on Northern Blvd. and 89th Street?&nbsp; I ask because I know there&#039;s a CVS in the low 70s on Northern.&nbsp; I&#039;m a wrap loving person and am always on the hunt for a good wrap!

They breakfast and lunch/dinner wraps. The place gets very busy on weekends. There are 2 CVS stores on Northern Blvd. The one in the 70&#039;s is next to IHOP.

				The wrap selection isn&#039;t anything crazy, but the food is good and very reasonable.<br />I&#039;m curious about their more &quot;ethnic&quot; food (not quite sure how to say that and be pc).&nbsp; Has anyone tried anything besides sandwiches/wraps and breakfast food?

				went to grab a bite here today with a friend from JHLife - chuckster.&nbsp; cute little place.&nbsp; we each tried a wrap.&nbsp; I liked mine: grilled chicken with a bit of avocado (they could have put more - sigh).&nbsp; <br /><br />but the best is THEY HAVE TABLES OUTSIDE.&nbsp; So if you don&#039;t mind sitting on Northern Blvd. directly in front of a bus stop, here&#039;s another place to eat.<br /><br />chuckster and I lasted&nbsp; - oh maybe five seconds outside.&nbsp; NOISY.&nbsp; One bus after another pulling up and the traffic coming from the City.&nbsp; ugh!&nbsp; But if that doesn&#039;t bother you...

				I tried the smoked turkey wrap with avocado, but found it a bit dry.&nbsp; I asked for a bit of honey mustard dressing on the side, and that did the trick.&nbsp; It was very good!&nbsp; Like Buddy said, there&#039;s outdoor seating, but the outdoor area is so tiny and it happens to be right in front of the very busy Q66 bus.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be going back though...breakfast next time.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing this place out Kate!
