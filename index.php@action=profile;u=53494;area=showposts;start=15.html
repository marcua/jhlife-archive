					I&#039;m just curious for those of you who are more politically connected or may be closer to Mr. Dromm or the JHBG, has a discussion ever come up about changing out the hideous street lights around our more beautiful blocks in the historic district for something more respectful to the era of our buildings? Even the block on 82nd Street between 35th and Roosevelt has nicer ones. Does anyone know if this has been proposed before? <br /><br />Thanks!

					I feel that far too often, the comments and topics on this site trend negative. I want to say something nice. Today I walked out of my apartment to the green market. It was bustling. The taco/ empanada-cart ladies were in full swing. There was a pumpkin patch right here on the play street. The fall harvest was represented in all its glory. There was a group of kids doing some kind of interactive cooking class . The breeze and the sunshine was just right- streaming through the canopies of our beautiful mature street trees and landscapes. I walked to 37th Avenue and found the Jackson Heights Art Club showcasing their works on the iron fencing of P.S. 69- an extra bonus for walking the neighborhood. Yes- the Jackson Heights Art Club is STILL ALIVE despite their website being down.<br /><br />Days like this we get to appreciate the beauty of our neighborhood. The architecture, the design, the history and the community that lives here today. The diversity here makes it an interesting, vibrant place to be. Jackson Heights may not be what it once was, but there are moments of pure beauty here.

					Queens is beautiful. Just walk down to Travers park on a weekend. As the sun is setting you will see children and families from countless ethnic and racial backgrounds- playing together, chasing each other, fighting, dousing with super soakers, eating.......just being who they are. Queens is full of hard-working people that make this city great and in turn, relish the fact that their homes here in Queens are also great. Jackson heights is a wonderful community for countless reasons.<br /><br />Queens is not trying to be something (ahhem....Brooklyn). Queens is something. Queens is authentic. Queens is real. Queens is where real working people live. I&#039;ve lived in numerous neighborhoods in Queens and appreciate the fact that you don&#039;t need an attitude to live here (who has energy for that)-&nbsp; Just be who you are - this is the place to be.

					I&#039;ll take this as a sign of better things to come- this is better than vacant storefronts. This is better IF Banana Republic allots budget to repair the old building façade while maintaining integrity. Commenting on the actual store is besides the point, it&#039;s what the profile of this store means in this setting (factory or no factory outlet). <br /><br />The problem with &quot;mom and pop&quot; shops is not only rents which appear to be a big issue, it is also the city in general. Don&#039;t put this all on the landlord.....btw if you were the landlord of a commercial property, you would want to bring in the highest return on your investment too.<br /><br />NYC makes all businesses pay UBT tax which is a slap in the face tax on top of all income taxes. The chunk of money small businesses and self employed individuals can put into building their business, paying their rent and hiring employees is significantly affected by this tax. It all stems back to the same root of all evil- millionaires not paying the proper percentage on their pied a terre investement properties- so NYC looks to the next victim- small businesses. It&#039;s a vicious cycle. <br /><br />Like it or not &quot;Mom and pop&quot; shops are on their way out. Not just because of rents. NYC does not do enough for small businesses to give them a fair chance

					I appreciate all of the efforts that went into bringing a town hall together and am sure that coordinating all of the offices and representatives took a lot of work, but that was a bit of a joke. Overall it was not well organized and it could have been moderated a lot more efficiently. Frankly I don&#039;t think that it was appropriate to have the building landlord there. This should have been a conversation between the residents of Jackson Heights and our senator and other representatives.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would have liked to hear the senator respond more thoroughly about ways to solve issues we face with our commercial real estate and our local businesses as opposed to hearing the landlord say &quot;he will do his best&quot; to ensure we are satisfied with his decisions. He is entitled to do whatever he wants with his private property and he has every right to. Focusing on ways to help support small businesses is something I want to hear more about. We have real problems that need specific solutions right here in our community.&nbsp; De Blasio surely isn&#039;t focused on helping small businesses and it sure isn&#039;t the problem of a landlord.<br /><br />There were a few bright moments -such as the young gentleman who proposed the idea of a shared office space in the upper levels of the building which is a realistic and achievable thing that could be added to our community. We need to focus on drawing young professionals, young families and couples into our neighborhood. We already have talent, entrepreneurs and money in this neighborhood- it&#039;s just that we don&#039;t have the capability to use their talents or operate their businesses here. Why can&#039;t we get it together? We need to continue drawing in new life to build a healthy community. Our commercial real estate is a legitimate problem for the continued health of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Mr. Bruno, I have to say that the fact that you showed up at all is commendable. Why didn&#039;t we get to hear from the real estate agents? I would have liked to hear his thoughts regarding salable square footage in the building. Surely they could tell us what their sales pitch is since they would have to give the pitch to anyone who calls. <br /><br />Honestly, we could have gotten so much more from that meeting. It was almost demeaning to continue dwelling on the random complaints we all have.....because if there is one thing we can agree on, it is that there are many things missing from this neighborhood to complain about. And no one needs to hear that again. It seemed like there were many important things missing that could have been said.<br /><br />

					@cornflake<br /><br />I like the category ideas thus far. Remember simplicity is key for something like this! Wordpress has become much more difficult to use in my opinion- 3 years ago it was much more user friendly- today I get lost in their system whenever I try to post something..... good luck with that, wish I could help. <br /><br />

					First of all welcome to the neighborhood! the blog is a great idea. Once it is off the ground what about making a scavenger hunt or get people to make posts in specific categories so that it has some kind of structure, that might make it more readable or more interesting than free for all photo posts (though there is nothing wrong with that). <br /><br />There are so many beautiful blocks in this neighborhood that are easy to overlook in the hustle and bustle <br /><br />Cheers!

					We desperately need a place that serves brunch in the hood- huge market that is missing here!<br /><br />1.serve brunch in addition to solid lunch dinner menu- consider having grab and go food in addition to sit down service <br />2. Make it really good, we know prices at most places on 37th ave aren&#039;t cheap so if u have good food you will have a buyer<br />3 we are dying for a place that we actually want to sit in to eat....,atmosphere is everything - it will set you apart from the standard neighborhood places- invest in good design at the beginning<br />4.the neighborhood is changing- reach for a new strategy for your business here- there are so many food options missing from the area that younger families and couples really want to see!<br /><br />Best wishes!

					Does anyone know if there is a group in Jackson Heights that does dramatic arts? Is anyone interested in this? I figured since we have an orchestra and so many community groups, there must be people who would be interested in theater/acting. Would love to know if anyone has any leads. Thanks!
