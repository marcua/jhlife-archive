				<br />I know there are older threads here regarding the topic of the violent crimes being primarily around Roosevelt, near the 90th st station. I am pretty sure I recall reading several yrs ago that it&#039;s due to the fact that the gangs are located&nbsp; in that region of the neighborhood.

				deja vu, posted here in 2013:<br /><br />&quot;Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced on September 29 that Pedro Silva, 20, a purported member of the M18 street gang, has been charged with fatally shooting a 33-year-old Corona man beneath the elevated Roosevelt Avenue train tracks in Jackson Heights.<br />Brown said, “In another unfortunate example of the senseless gun violence that seems to more and more permeate our society, the defendant is accused of chasing after the victim with others and fatally shooting him in the head while he was lying helplessly on the ground. His alleged actions were violent and ruthless and the charges against him will be vigorously prosecuted.”<br />The district attorney identified the defendant as Silva, of 33-32 89th St. in&nbsp; Jackson Heights.  Silva, who is presently awaiting arraignment in Queens Criminal Court, is charged with second-degree murder, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and tampering with physical evidence.  If convicted, Silva faces up to 25 years to life in prison. <br />Brown said that, according to the charges, Silva, along with several other gang members, was chasing the victim, Ivan Rodriguez, 33, of Corona, at approximately 6:00 p.m. on September 20.  When Rodriguez fell in front of 89-08 Roosevelt Avenue, Silva shot him, striking him in the head and neck – before fleeing and discarding his weapon in a pile of garbage near 37th Avenue. Thereafter, police allegedly recovered a .22 caliber firearm, five spent rounds and one live round from a pile of garbage located in front of 37-61 88th Street.<br />Rodriguez was transported to a local Queens hospital where he was pronounced dead.&quot;

				Guys, I know gang violence happens every day but I feel so anxious and literally nauseous from watching that vid on the NY Post. I&#039;d suggest people don&#039;t watch the footage unless you&#039;re mentally strong because this has ripped me up. <br /><br />What I&#039;m having trouble dealing with in JH right now is that there is NO VISIBLE POLICE PRESENCE. We need uniformed cops patrolling the area RIGHT NOW. Have you SEEN how many cops sit in their idling cars when it&#039;s cold outside? Don&#039;t go into the Force unless you&#039;re willing and able to patrol these streets. Sitting in your police vehicles is NOT ENOUGH.<br /><br />If the 115th Precinct is reading this, BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS. You don&#039;t care about our neighborhood. You don&#039;t care about brown people. You take our tax dollars and laugh it up as our kids are dying. THIS NEEDS TO END.

				It is is upsetting and very worrisome that gangsters are feeling free enough to settle their disputes in broad daylight in a crowded train. <br /><br />The suspect was 26 and had 12 prior arrests. The &quot;victim&quot; was 20 and had already been arrested seven times (he also seems to be have been the one pulling the gun in the first place). At least I get some comfort knowing that one went to hell and the other went to prison.

				Regarding complaints about the 115th, I think this crime technically falls into MTA police jurisdiction. I don&#039;t think the 115th police the platforms.<br /><br />The City had announced an antigang initiative last year, and Dromm had advertised gang buses to be parked in gang territories, a place where gangsters could go and talk it out. <br /><br />I promise you, I&#039;m not smirking.

But, I don&#039;t expect that to happen again.<br /><br />http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48271/<br /><br />I lived in a major gang turf cross section in LA and one of those gangs was involved in this shooting (18th st). Three of the cities largest gangs intersected at my cross streets. There was a lot of &quot;activity&quot;.&nbsp; It seems that culture has spread to our city. <br /><br />That particular LAPD precinct at the time was one of the most militarized but, also notoriously corrupt. So, there you have a combination of resources and corruption. I respect most police officers but, the job is also not attracting the very best people. It&#039;s the same with the MTA and NYCHA workers. <br /><br />Tax dollars need to be audited and that can be an issue with a bureaucracy. Of course &quot;LESS&quot; government would only make the issue worse. DeBlasio has spent a lot on beefing up the police. There is no simple solution. Some citizens take to added resources and opportunities and others squander them and continue to commit crimes. It&#039;s not a black and white issue. Crime in this city has also fallen to record lows.

				There&#039;s a lot of police presence in that area. Until recently, we had a bucket satellite parked on 89th and 37th for YEARS. Undercover cops are everywhere. But they can&#039;t break the allure of gangster life. It&#039;s part of pop culture: in movies, the music, gangland and gun culture is celebrated. How to reach young people (the victim was only 20!) who start on this path so young, so innocently, merely seeking fun, excitement, belonging, recognition?

				I&#039;m posting a Fox article which contains the photos of two persons of interest, which I hadn&#039;t seen before. They are not great pics, but better than nothing. <br /><br />I notice, though, that their clothes don&#039;t match up well to the clothes in the video. Can&#039;t explain that.<br /><br />https://www.foxnews.com/us/alleged-nyc-subway-shooter-suspected-ms-13-member-was-in-us-illegally-ice-says
