				Haven&#039;t tried them for breakfast, but I&#039;m pretty sure that I&#039;ve seen huevos rancheros on Taqueria Coatzingo&#039;s menu.&nbsp; Coatzingo is on Roosevelt Ave., between 75th and 76th (I believe).

				Coatzingo has a second location as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s on 82nd St. just steps away from the 7 train stop, on the Elmhurst side.&nbsp; The address is 40-18 82nd St. Elmhurst<br /><br />Chowhound recently had a long thread called Taqueria Coatzingo - Why it is my favorite Mexican (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/247808)

				Sorry to go off-topic.&nbsp; This thread reminds me that in Berkeley, CA there used to be a breakfast place called Buttercup that served a delicious dish called &quot;Huevos Kathmandu.&quot;&nbsp; It was huevos rancheros, but with curry instead of salsa.&nbsp; Absolutely delicious.&nbsp; It would be a perfect fit for Jackson Heights.

				La Flor -- 53-02 Roosevelt -- has huevos rancheros on the breakfast menu. I haven&#039;t ordered it but everything else I&#039;ve had there has been delicious (including, today, a surprisingly tasty carrot and butternut squash frittata).

				How about <strong>De Mole in Sunnyside</strong>?<br /><br />This thread on Chowhound includes a comment from someone who says that the huevos rancheros at De Mole&nbsp; are the best he&#039;s ever had. http://www.chowhound.com/topics/484075

				Oh, no, no worries. I didn&#039;t take it personally at all. I think a good part of the fun of chatting about restaurants is tossing back and forth about when they&#039;re good, when they&#039;re bad, and so on. I just wish you had hit it during one of their dynamo moments -- it&#039;s too bad the culinary stars didn&#039;t align with your visit.
