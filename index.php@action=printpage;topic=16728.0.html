				I was informed it should take about a month.<br /><br />I forgot to ask, but I got the impression it will be open during the renovation.

				It could certainly use it, especially the floors! It&#039;s not my favorite supermarket but there are things I do buy better priced than elsewhere.

				Any updates on this? The store didn&#039;t look much different when I stopped by the other day.

				The store needs a major overhaul!&nbsp; The CTowns in Astoria are fairly nice.&nbsp; Sad to say, this one is a dump.

				The store is beginning to look much nicer. They put in all new floors and it makes quite a big difference in the appearance.

				If the store significantly improves business will increase.&nbsp; I know several who live very close to C Town but refuse to shop there and instead shop (with their carts) at Foodtown &amp; Food Dynasty.&nbsp; &nbsp;

My sense is that it&#039;s ongoing. However, even if they make it look extra spiffy, they are still going to have to do better on the fresh food quality. The fruit area always looks very depressing. I only usually go there to pick up a few staples and things like yogurt or milk.

				The face lift is continuing at C Town and it&#039;s looking much better. They are rearranging some of the food items as well. All the floors are new, which makes a big difference. Now they seem to be working on shelving and signage and some other updates. Hopefully more food and product improvements will follow.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/o0Kgak4.jpg?1)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/pV9WzDu.jpg?1)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/oBUJfGl.jpg?1)<br />
