				Hello Folks-<br /><br />I&#039;m new to Jackson Heights and love the historic architecture surrounding us. As we all know,&nbsp; Jackson Heights is the best example&nbsp; of the garden apartment movement in the U.S., so I wanted to create a blog where potential members like you would contribute photos of buildings and architectural elements from your camera phone as you walk around.&nbsp; The purpose of the blog is to create an architectural and visual presence of Jackson Heights on the web. Let me know if you are interested in contributing photos&nbsp; and if you have any ideas to make the blog more interesting... More info on the blog to come ( I am still in the process of launching it).<br /><br />Thanks! :D

				&nbsp;Are you familiar with Daniel Karatzas? He has literally written the book on Jackson Heights and it&#039;s architecture,<br />gardens and planning. I would consult or join heads with him as he has a fabulous collection of historic photographs<br />and seems to always be wanting to profile Jackson Heights architecture in the same way you describe. If I am not<br />mistaken, he is singlehandedly responsible for the Historic District designation and the vigilance needed to make<br />sure this is taken seriously in the neighborhood. His spring tours through the historic district are a must so look<br />for them through the JHBG group.<br />&nbsp; Plus he has a great wry sense of humor and champions Jackson Heights like no one else. Works in real estate here somewhere also and would be easy to collaborate with I think. Check out this link which is a little older _<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.jhbg.org/history/history.html<br /><br />

				Welcome to the neighborhood! I agree, this is a great idea.<br /><br />You should take a look at this past JH Life Post regarding original real estate brochures for many of the buildings in the neighborhood: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=6461.msg41283#msg41283 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=6461.msg41283#msg41283)<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think this is <em>the</em> book that Taggie mentions, but it is a book about Jackson Heights released last year:<br /><br />Images of America: Jackson Heights by Jason D. Antos. <br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130715/jackson-heights/new-book-details-jackson-heights-past-through-historic-photos (http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130715/jackson-heights/new-book-details-jackson-heights-past-through-historic-photos)<br /><br />

				Thanks for the feedback-<br /><br />And yes, I am in touch with Dan Karatzas and I did finish reading his informative book!&nbsp; I also came across&nbsp; the Columbia University website with all the building brochures of the various garden apartments- amazing stuff. I&#039;d like to see this blog span the modern times and document through people&#039;s cameras the buildings, interior lobbies, interior private gardens, street scape scenes and interior spaces. The blog would document how people adapt these historical spaces in &quot;modern times&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s an interactive blog where people can easily post their photos, add blurbs, and categorize their photos into various sections: garden apartments, garden homes, interior court yards, public parks or commercial spaces. We&nbsp; could begin to start an online&nbsp; dialogue on the spaces and buildings we love around the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post a link in this thread as soon as I&#039;ve launched the site.

				First of all welcome to the neighborhood! the blog is a great idea. Once it is off the ground what about making a scavenger hunt or get people to make posts in specific categories so that it has some kind of structure, that might make it more readable or more interesting than free for all photo posts (though there is nothing wrong with that). <br /><br />There are so many beautiful blocks in this neighborhood that are easy to overlook in the hustle and bustle <br /><br />Cheers!

				@ queensplantboy- We&#039;re on the same page. I&#039;m thinking the blog would be divided into categories.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my (tentative) list:<br /><br />Garden Apartments (clearly the most obvious)<br />Apartment Courtyards<br />Streets/ Public Spaces<br />Interior Spaces (like apartmenttherapy.com photos)<br />Interior Lobbies<br />Commercial Spaces<br />Neighborhood Events<br />Vintage Jackson Heights (Old Photos)<br /><br /><br />(Do you guys suggest any other categories?)<br /><br />Now for the difficult part- I&#039;m trying to design the blog page on wordpress and it looks like it&#039;ll take me awhile&nbsp; to get it up and running and make it easy for people to add photos.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				@cornflake<br /><br />I like the category ideas thus far. Remember simplicity is key for something like this! Wordpress has become much more difficult to use in my opinion- 3 years ago it was much more user friendly- today I get lost in their system whenever I try to post something..... good luck with that, wish I could help. <br /><br />

				There is a nondescript building on 81st between 37th and 35th Ave.<br /><br />The side that faces the Methodist Church playground is incredibly decorated in brick.&nbsp; Remember, this side of the building used to overlook a garden and so was made to look better because it commanded a better view.

				@ homeowner-&nbsp; please post your pics of new renovations under the&nbsp; corresponding building type. I&#039;m sure this will create some comments on the blog instead of devoting a section entirely to renovations.

				&nbsp;A for effort here. It&#039;s a great new addition and am sure many will follow. Personally, would love to see clearer<br />photographs. Suggestions even for iphone pics are to try and take the photographs at times of day when light<br />is bright- 10am and 2pm this time of year might be good. Steady yourself by maybe leaning on a car if you <br />can&#039;t use some kind of mini-tripod. Check out gorilla pods for example. Other than that this is a project that<br />showcases what a lot of us love about Jackson Heights but strong content has to be there. Big thanks!
