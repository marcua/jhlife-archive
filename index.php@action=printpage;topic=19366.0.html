				<strong>Aged Salice Salentino!</strong><br /><br />This week we are featuring a dynamic red from Puglia (the heel of Italy’s boot). Cosimo Taurino’s family has been making wines using the ancient grapes of southern Italy for seven generations. His Salice Salentino is made from a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia, which is aged at the winery until it is ready to drink.<br /><br />The “current” vintage is from 2010 and shows a wonderful balance of earthy, spicy and fruit flavors. It&#039;s a wonderful opportunity to savor a wine that has been allowed to properly age, a luxury which has disappeared for most wine drinkers in our modern age.<br /><br />The Queensboro will be featuring the 2010 Salice Salentino by the glass starting Wednesday night. Because of its balance, it matches a range of food - pizza, burgers, pastas- but we especially like it with Chef Tony’s Double-Cut Pork Chop with grilled peaches… delish! Come on down and try and glass- we love it and think you will too!<br /><br />Not only are we offering this wine by the glass today, but if you get a bottle we&#039;ll knock 25% off the price, and as the Italians from Puglia say, <em>&quot;that&#039;s a heel of a deal!&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Thursday at 8:30 - the Teej Trio perform!</strong><br /><br />We have another new local band for everyone to enjoy this Thursday!<br /><br />TJ Adorno is a local guitarist and song writer from Jackson Heights, Queens. He has been active throughout New York&#039;s creative music scene since 2014, performing in genres such as: Jazz, Hip-Hop, Neo Soul, Rock, and more. Also known as TEEJ, he is the frontman and band leader of his projects The SidePocket and TeeJ Tr3o. For more information, booking, or other inquiries, visit teejmusic.com.<br /><br />Fancy checking them out? Make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-19&amp;seats=2)!<br /><br /><strong>Even more events!<br /></strong><br />We&#039;re always busy at The Q coming up with fun stuff, new food and great drinks. We will go into more details another time but here&#039;s a sneak peek at some upcoming events:<br /><br />Friday - Gallery Opening for the awesome Annabel Poppa, from 6-9PM<br /><br />This weekend - the start of Oktoberfest!<br /><br />Tuesday - A Cheese &amp; Beer night with Stand Alone Cheese Shop!<br /><br />Next Thursday - The inimitable Ed Fuqua and Jim Hershman perform!
