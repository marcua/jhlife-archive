				While everything moves slowly, slowly in Jackson Heights...and debates about minor changes leading to GENTRIFICATION...

				i was going to post about this place a few days ago when i saw the storefront while exiting Fay Da. The mirrored windows and decor i could sneak a peek at look pretty cheesy. not that you can necessarily judge a book by its&#039; cover, but i&#039;ll be interested to see what the owners&#039; definition of &quot;gastropub&quot; might be.

				Peered through the window coverings of Duo the other day, looks like a good space. Seemed small from what I could see, but eh, so what? The location is RIGHT next to Fay Da &amp; a subway entrance, so they shouldn&#039;t have problems getting customers. Seems like they&#039;re pretty close to opening up. Doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s upscale or anything frou-frou, but it definitely looks nice enough. Just as an aside, has anyone tried Lungta yet? It&#039;s kitty corner to Duo.

				<strong>IT’S OPEN</strong><br /><br />Went in a few days ago.<br /><br />Location: 40-37 75 St&nbsp; on the south side of broadway. <br /><br />Less a gastropub (and by less, I mean &quot;ZERO&quot;),<br /><br />..... more an incredibly loud sports bar. (6 giant tvs all playing sports, bright neon/lights).<br /><br />Drinks list is all InBev, no&nbsp; (zero) craft beer. Wines and spirits pretty generic/mass market too. Some funky cocktails, but nothing you couldn&#039;t get in the neighborhood already.<br /><br />Not sure if they have food yet…..(apparently they have popcorn)<br /><br />Very convenient for stumbling in/out of the Roosevelt ave station. <br /><br />Don’t think anyone has to worry about gentrification with this one…..<br /><br /><br />
