				If you would like to become a subscriber to my quarterly report on all residential real estate transactions in Jackson Heights (11372 zip code), please visit my website:&nbsp; www.jhrealestatereport.com&nbsp; &nbsp;Please contact me should you have any real estate needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dan Karatzas...<br /><br />Hello and Happy New Year!<br /><br />2015 was a very good year for real estate in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Record prices were achieved in virtually every category of residential real estate.&nbsp; For houses, sales volume was down, due to so few properties coming to market.&nbsp; For the full year, average sales prices climbed 21.7% to $857,733 for one-family houses, and 7.2% to $870,737 for two-family houses.&nbsp; Three-family houses saw their average sales price decline by 16.8% to $905,833.&nbsp; Three one-family houses sold for over $1 million.&nbsp; &nbsp;Two were properties with commercial potential, the third was one of the largest English Garden Homes on 86th Street, and closed at $1.33 million.&nbsp; While many two-family houses sold in the $900s, the one that closed at $1.3 million on 72nd Street will likely be used as part of a new residential development.<br /><br />Apartment sales climbed by 10.8% to 482 units, up in all categories except prewar elevator cooperatives.&nbsp; Average sales prices rose between 6.7% and 16.1% in the four categories: to $226,233 for postwar elevator cooperatives, $339,453 for prewar elevator cooperatives, $363,480 for prewar walkup cooperatives, and $391,947 for condominiums.<br /><br />Records were broken at many of the original garden cooperatives:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1.075 million for the largest four-bedroom, three-bath at The Towers<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$865,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath at Hawthorne Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$695,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath at Hawthorne Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$542,500 for a two-bedroom, one-bath at Hampton Court<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$405,000 for a one-bedroom at Hampton Court<br /><br />At prewar cooperatives (converted in the 1980s):<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$637,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath at Fillmore Hall<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$603,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath at The Berkeley<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$401,500 for a one-bedroom at The Berkeley<br /><br />At postwar cooperatives:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$405,000 for a three-bedroom, one-bath at Roosevelt Terrace<br /><br />And condominiums:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$692,410 for a two-bedroom at Stratford Hall<br /><br />Finally, as you probably are aware, Jackson Heights has received much media attention of the last year or so:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of four “The Hunt” columns in the New York Times real estate section<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Block by Block” video (in which I appear!) also on the New York Times’ website<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A profile in the Wall Street Journal<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A documentary by Frederick Wiseman<br /><br />We’ll see what 2016 has in store as the year proceeds.&nbsp; Again, should you have any real estate needs, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />Cell: 646 285 7762<br />www.beaudoinrealty.com<br />www.jhrealestatereport.com<br /><br /><br />

				the most amazing one to me is the stratford hall 2 bedroom for 692k. Are those units huge or something? Why so expensive? Also noticed another 2 bed currently for sale in that building at $649k and it doesn&#039;t look remarkable at all from pictures.

				You can check Stratford&#039;s typical floorplan here: http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/projects/view/25589<br /><br />I would assume F8 is on the last floor with pretty views on the Chateau garden and the Towers... Looks fairly big. I&#039;d rather avoid commenting on price tags, ultimately if they can afford it, good for them!

But the folks buying these, at these prices, are not looking for cash-flow or even a good &#039;investment&#039; in the traditional sense. They are looking to offset the potential risks of 1) their home currency, 2) political stability in their home nation, and (possibly) 3) launder questionable earnings. Condo&#039;s provide that ability to do that and Co-ops do not. So even if a buyer is paying 50-60% more than a similar co-op, it&#039;s just a cost of doing business.
