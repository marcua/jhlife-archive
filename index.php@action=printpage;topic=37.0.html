				This NY Times blog article starts out talking about JH luring suburban customers to its ethnic stores.<br />http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/are-ethnic-shopping-strips-luring-suburban-customers/<br /><br />It puts only a positive spin on it from the point of view of bringing money into the city from the suburbs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it mentions the strain on the neighborhood from the congestion/traffic point of view.

				Can&#039;t have everything. Lots of new people moving into JH seem to complain about this (at the same time, they love the food). Most who have lived here for some time have become desensitized about it. Best best, drive down 35th or 34th ave. if you want avoid congestion/traffic.

				I&#039;ve lived in new york all of my life and I&#039;m tired of hearing people say, &quot;That&#039;s life in the big city. There&#039;s nothing you can do.&quot; Being &quot;desensitized&quot; is just another way of saying &quot;hiding your head in the sand&quot;. People in every neighborhood have a responsibility to protect the things they love and fight against the things that take away from their quality of life.

				JH is becoming a popular town. People are going to come like it or not. It helps bring in money to the community which helps in vitalizing the community.&nbsp; It just so happens that the &quot;main street&quot; area happens to run across two streets which is Roosevelt and 37th ave, unlike areas like Corona which run down Junction Blvd. Yeah, 37th ave was a very street say 20 years ago. I say if people are that upset about it, I would suggest speak up at your next community board meeting. That why we have public officials. They&#039;re not their to make appearances at annnual Halloween parades.<br /><br />

				Speaking up is exactly what I&#039;m talking about. I have no problem with people coming in to Jackson heights to shop, eat or live. My problem is with people who disrespect the neighborhood by selling drugs, writing graffiti, or double parking and honking their horns illegally.

				I have been living in 73rd street for years and the traffic is getting worse and worse.&nbsp; You see the entire blocks from 37rd to 35th ave (sometimes up to Northern Blvd) is filled with congested track every evening for a couple of hours.&nbsp; During the time, you are suffering from the constant aggressive car honking.&nbsp; This is totally unacceptable state considering the 73rd street is RESIDENTIAL street.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a classic&nbsp; issue: Business Interest vs Protecting Environment.&nbsp; Basically, our quality of life has been sacrificed by the business interest on 73rd street and 74th street.&nbsp; And there is even plan to add more stories on the buildings on 73rd street for business.&nbsp; The owner of the building is a millioner who owns lots of property on this area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many long time residents have been speaking up about this issue to our district council member for a long time.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the city has not been so active about controlling the overdevelopment and improving our quality of life.&nbsp;
