			Friendly low key place &amp; service. Food is fresh &amp; made with care. Don’t seem to have a liquor license yet. Like that it’s not too “sit down-y.” Got the fried calamari &amp; it was quite tasty, not at all rubbery or greasy. It’s a welcome addition &amp; I’m looking forward to many more cozy meals there!
