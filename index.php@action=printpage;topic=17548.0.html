				Does anyone have more information on the Con Ed construction taking place on 35th Avenue.&nbsp; I was away for two weeks and came back to the war zone...I received emails from Con Edison, but do not see any information on the Community Board website etcetera.&nbsp; <br /><br />Noise on Feb 20 was very excessive near 84th/85th street for long periods of the day.&nbsp; I emailed Coned for more information so I can plan around the noise and work.<br />With all the parking restrictions, would have been nice to eliminate alternate side parking in the area as well. <br /><br />I know upgrades are needed to the electrical grid and the project cuts through a lot of Western Queens, but if Coned or community reps could provide more information on large construction projects that impact quality of life.&nbsp; Any information on how long and noisy this work will be...

				our building is on 35th, spanning 76th and 77th. several days of ear-splitting noise, starting very early, punctuated by pungent hot asphalt scent that seeped through closed windows.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been getting emails on a regular basis from ConEd, and i&#039;d imagine they know more about what theyre doing than CB3 does. it sucks, but it&#039;ll end soon.

				I&#039;ve heard that it&#039;s infrastructure upgrades that are needed due to the LGA expansion. Shrug.<br /><br />Any improvements are good so we don&#039;t have what happened to our area in the summer of 2006.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Queens_blackout

				Today they started making noise a little after 6:35 am even though Con Ed email said work starts at 7 am.&nbsp; If I need to close my windows and use air condition, maybe Con Ed should not charge for the inconvenience.&nbsp; Hopefully the upgrade will be worth it.

				Did anyone else hear an incredibly loud banging and dragging sound this morning, starting before 5am and lasting nearly an hour? I think it was related to this construction (around 85th St &amp; 35th Ave). Heard at least a few people yelling things out the window in response.<br /><br />There was a manhole fire (according to the NYPD &amp; FD on scene at around 6:30), perhaps linked to the construction, so not sure if the early sound had anything to do with that, but I made a 311 complaint anyway. Apparently some people lost power, too.

Especially since Coned negligently cut a gas main two weeks ago on that same block and hundreds of residents are going to be without cooking gas or gas dryers for 5 months on 85th st. These are the same apartments that have no electricity today due to this man hole fire. I think coned is just trying to get out of their responsibility and not have to pay for damages. Just my theory of course.
