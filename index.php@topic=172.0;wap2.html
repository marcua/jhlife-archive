			Hey everyone, curbed.com (a great news/rumor source for NYC real estate) is having a best NYC neighborhood contest called the &quot;Curbed Cup&quot; and Jackson Heights is in the running! <br /><br />Go to http://www.curbed.com and scroll down to vote for our nabe. Right now JH needs the votes (JH 43.7% vs. FiDi 56.3%) so pass it along to your friends! <br /><br />In the previous round, JH beat Bushwick(Brooklyn) so FiDi may be a bigger challenge but we have more personality so there&#039;s a good chance we could make it!

			&nbsp;:(<br />Oops, I think the poll may be over. It seemed like the voting was still on. Oh well, still good to be recognized by Curbed IMHO.<br />

			The comments on Curbed are very degrading towards Jackson Heights and immigrants in general. The zip code envy in this city is sad, bordering on deranged.

			I agree. It is shocking to see such blatant hatred and ignorance esp. from other New Yorkers. There were several comments though that were very supportive about JH and I think showed the ridiculousness of the negative comments.

			If this was your first time reading comments on Curbed posts, I can see why you&#039;d be surprised and disappointed.&nbsp; But the truth is that the comments always tend to be this way - no matter what the topic.&nbsp; For some reason, it&#039;s just the nature of the beast.
