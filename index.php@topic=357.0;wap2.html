			Curious if anyone out there knows anything about what&#039;s happening with the Polk Theater on 93rd St. and 37th ave. <br /><br />I know it was built in the late 30&#039;s, and served the neighborhood for quite a long time as a regular movie theater. At some point it transitioned over to Adult Films and sank in to ill-repute and disrepair (as many porn theaters do). Somewhere in Mid 2006, the building was bought by developers and has since been closed to the public (perhaps for the better)<br /><br />A series of stores adjacent to The Polk have also been closed for a significant amount of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems as if the developers are planning on waiting out all the remaining commercial tenants and may proceed with demolishing the property entirely.<br /><br />I ventured in to the Polk once while it was still open and discovered that under the layers of grime and smut there was a beautiful old 30s style theater with a large auditorium. It seems to me that Jackson Heights could benefit from a visible arts space that supports local arts groups and community functions. <br /><br />Much like the Eagle (or Earle) theatre was transformed in to a unique Bollywood Gem for the neighborhood, wouldn&#039;t it be great to have another space that brings the arts and culture closer to our community? <br /><br />Anyway, I was jsut curious to see if any one out there knew anything about what&#039;s happening on that block ? <br /><br />-<br /><br />Andrew&nbsp; &nbsp;

			unfortunately that whole block has been demolished.&nbsp; I was hoping that at least the theater could have been saved.

			I checked on the Department of Buildings database to see if I could figure out what&#039;s going to be built here.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I know how to interpret the documents, but they seem to indicate this will be a 6-story building, with ground floor retail, medical offices on the second floor, and four floors of residences (with a total of 32 units).&nbsp; It will also include a two-level underground parking garage with space for 83 cars.&nbsp; The initial application was rejected, but only because the filing fee was for an improper amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not find any pictures of what this building will look like.
