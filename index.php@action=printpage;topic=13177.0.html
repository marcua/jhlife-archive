				http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150427/jackson-heights/astoria-boutique-lockwood-opening-second-outpost-jackson-heights<br /><br /><br />Lockwood, the Astoria boutique, is coming to JH. If youve ever been to their other shop in Astoria, Lockwood, you&#039;ll know that they have quality stuff for kids of all ages. They definitely get a warm welcome. <br /><br /><br />It&#039;s replacing an eyebrow place, I think that&#039;s an upgrade.

				Lockwood is great.&nbsp; A true sign of higher quality stores on 37th.&nbsp; But, if I was the new age store, i don&#039;t know if i would be happy about this, as there would be some crossover.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope the neighborhood could support both.

				Went in to make a &quot;welcome to the neighborhood&quot; purchase today. Very nice, eclectic selection of merchandise (nice jewelry that I intend to go back and look at again) and I must say, it&#039;s the sort of shop you would expect to find in the Village or Chelsea. There were lots of customers speaking lots of different languages when I was there. A very good sign that this place is destined for success in JH. I came home with two interesting looking coffee mugs and a bag of that &quot;Native&quot; coffee someone was writing about. I&#039;m very happy about this store! Go see it!

				I&#039;m the odd one out on this thread but someone has to play devil&#039;s advocate. Honestly, it looks like another crap store to me. They don&#039;t sell anything I need or could use. Odd plates and mugs, pass. Blank notebook, pass. Patchouli, definitely pass. Novelty books, maybe as a Christmas gift. I wish them luck though.

				i stopped by yesterday - loved it! the store has a great assortment of quirky, fun every day items like mugs and bowls, jewelry, kids toys/back packs, a lovely shelf arrangement of scented candles, and cards. some things were on the pricey side ($16 for a coffee mug seemed pricey to me, for instance). overall, a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and i wish Lockwood well! i hope this is the beginning of more boutique, carefully curated, aesthetically pleasing shops to 37th ave&nbsp; :)

				It&#039;s a nice store, but the kind of place I might only shop in once or twice a year unless they are big on rotating their inventory with special &quot;seasonal&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;holiday&quot; items. (And it definitely gave me a flashback to my days as a renter back in Park Slope!)

				I&#039;m so happy to have a place where I can buy non-Hallmark cards nearby! The store is super cute and the staff seems great. Yeah, a $16 mug is a little pricey, but there are plenty of cheapo options right down the street. I&#039;m so glad I no longer need to leave the neighborhood for little gifts and good scented candles. (As opposed to the gross Febreze ones you can get in the supermarket.) Welcome!

				How come there&#039;s been no mention of Inner Peace? This store used to have a much wider selection, and I think they had to reduce it because they weren&#039;t getting as much business.<br /><br />They&#039;ve been around for the good and the bad times. I may not shop there that often, but if you&#039;re looking for little giftable items and children&#039;s things, I think they deserve our business too.

				Inner Peace is most deserving of our support. You can&#039;t beat it for quality, thoughtful gifts and a lovely shopping experience. I am hoping that Lockwood will attract new people that may then wander into IP. With the improved Espresso 77 and Swim Two Birds, Mimi&#039;s Yoga and a few other gems, we may be in for a real destination strip. The start of good things to come. I am optimistic.

				I totally agree that there is room for both stores. I think Inner Peace has a devoted clientele, and their merchandise has a different style than what I saw at Lockwood. More new age-y and spiritual, versus kind of camp and edgy at Lockwood. I think they appeal to different types of people, to a certain extent. I sure hope they both continue to do well. We have so very many pharmacies, and restaurants offering similar food, and sari stores, and dollar stores, etc...why not two cute little gift shops (with stuff for kids) in the bustling neighborhood of JH?

				i for one am very happy about this addition to the nabe! (ugh, nabe sounds vaguely obscene, and overtly douchey yet i used it anyway). i&#039;ve been a fan of this store since even before its lockwood namesake opened up and it was called site. this will be dangerous for my wallet, as before i could safely walk the streets without being tempted by pretty things. for those who might be lamenting the gentrification that this (or other things) signifiies, let&#039;s remember that the rate of gentrification seems to be slower here than most other neighborhoods...first we got espresso 77, then starbucks, then table wine...then a long, long, lull, a revamped arunee, and now, lockwood. at this rate, jackson heights will be the next park slope in about...never.

				I don&#039;t think of Starbucks as upscale;&nbsp; I think of it as evidence that a large, multinational corporation sees the neighborhood as one in which it could thrive selling $4 cups of coffee despite the fact that DD sells the same coffee for half price.&nbsp; That tells me that their market research indicates that our neighborhood can support stores that, in the past, corporations did not feel it could support.

				I missed this entire thread but came across Lockwood yesterday on my way home from the Italian market. Lovely shop, very nice salesclerk, cool items, and good prices. Nothing like this exists in Jackson Heights, so it&#039;s a very welcome addition. Welcome, Lockwood! I hope you&#039;re here for a very long time to come! BTW, this is far more than just a children&#039;s shop. They happen to sell items for children, but they also sell wonderful household items and a great selection of artists&#039; cards for all occasions, plus much more.

				Walked by and saw the signs saying &quot;Epic semi-yearly sale—50-75% off select items.&quot; Went in and noticed some empty shelves. Could the store be on its way out already? Empty shelves are not a good sign. Makes it look like the store is closing. Just wondering.

Odd.

				Three days ago they posted on FB that they&#039;re hiring for both the JH and Astoria stores, so I don&#039;t think they&#039;re closing.<br /><br />CL Link:<br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/ret/5432468259.html<br /><br />

				They have &quot;epic&quot; clearance sales all the time in Astoria.&nbsp; It&#039;s a way of clearing out stock to make room for all new stock items.&nbsp; I made some really sweet purchases there a few weeks ago.

				I hope they make it, but I don&#039;t know how they and Inner Peace survive, considering our high rents. With the exception of holidays they don&#039;t seem busy enough. Hope I&#039;m wrong.
