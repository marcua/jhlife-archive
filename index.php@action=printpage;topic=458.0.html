				Does anyone have any recommendations for dog boarding places?&nbsp; I want to find a place that does not crate our puppy for most of the day.&nbsp; And although he loves other dogs, he thrives on human contact.&nbsp; An outdoor playground would be a plus.&nbsp; Far Fetched Acres is a bit pricey for me and I&#039;m also looking into Eva&#039;s Play Pups in Brooklyn which charges $40/day.

				rainbow pets boards but first they &quot;interview your dog&quot; to make sure he/she&#039;s friendly and will get along with others nicely. You also need all shots etc.<br /><br />They let dogs loose in large grooming area and enclosed back yard.&nbsp; There are photos on their site.&nbsp; I take my toy poodle there for monthly grooming and shop there.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice, modern, clean, friendly.<br /><br />http://www.rainbowpetsupplies.com/<br />

				Pet Chauffeur is a pet transportation service that also has a boarding facility.&nbsp; They are based in Long Island City<br />and you have the option of either dropping of your pet or paying to have them do the transport.&nbsp; Dogs have an outdoor play area where they can socialize.&nbsp; The website has pricing information.&nbsp; I had a good experience with them<br />recently and would use the service again.<br /><br />http://www.nypetboarding.com/<br /><br />http://www.petride.com/

				We checked out Rainbow. Not impressive. The area they crate the dogs was very depressing. Instead, we&#039;ve considered Eva&#039;s Play Pups. It seems pretty good, much brighter. We&#039;re going to check out NY Pet Boarding as well.

				Thank you for the suggestions.&nbsp; I think kennels anthropomorphize our dogs to begin with by requiring interviews!&nbsp; Anyways, I went over there and I think it&#039;s nice that they have the backyard and allow the dogs the freedom to roam.&nbsp; However, I was turned off by the location of the kennels which were in the basement and the ventilation seemed poor.&nbsp; Plus they put the dogs in the kennel from 8pm until 8am the next morning, which I think is too much for our puppy in one sitting.&nbsp; The rate is affordable at $25/night.<br /><br />LordB, I called Pet Chauffeur and they gave me a rate of $55 for a one way transport from JH to LIC.&nbsp; Is this the rate that you were getting?&nbsp; <br />

				I&#039;ll be surprised if any one doesn&#039;t put the animals in the kennels from approx. 8pm to 8am since most businesses are closed then.&nbsp; I am curious to see if you guys find something different.&nbsp; The flip side of the argument is that the dogs are free roaming in Rainbow&#039;s grooming area or back yard from 8am to 8pm.&nbsp; And whenever I&#039;m there shopping I see happy dogs. <br /><br />But, again, I never saw the kennels since I haven&#039;t needed to board my dog.&nbsp; The one time I went away for three days, I hired a dog/house sitter to spend the night at my place (in addition to walking my dog 3 to 4 times a day) so my dog got to sleep in the bed with the sitter.&nbsp; I prefer that if given the option.

My dogs are fairly low maintenance. They only need to be fed. Although they are used to human companionship, they don&#039;t require human interaction as they play with each other. They don&#039;t need to be walked, &#039;cause they know how and like using the wee-wee pads or newspaper. I rarely have them show clipped, so their puppy cuts don&#039;t even require any maintenance brushing or combing.<br /><br />The way I see it, dogs are going to miss their people no matter what. So at least keeping them in their own home will make it a little easier and less traumatic for them. A few times, in an emergency, I&#039;ve taken in a little furball who&#039;s Mom or Dad has to go to the hospital for a while. I spent hours carrying them around to keep them as stress-free as I could while they try to adjust to a new environment.

				NYC- Why the abrasive attitude?<br /><br />I think the staff are hanging out with the dogs, not sitting in the office. And I believe there is only one overnight person. If you want to disagree, you&#039;re free to, but please do not insinuate that I am for some reason or another lying. I am merely passing on information that was conveyed to me. From my very short encounter with this facility, I did find them to appear very trustworthy and I do plan to leave my previous dog there when I cannot take him with me on vacation. As much as it hurts me to not take him with me, I find this facility the best option so far.

I am merely passing on information that was conveyed to me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>My problem is not with you. It is with them. <br /><br />Let me tell you why.<br /><br />Last summer I got a phone call at 7:05 in the evening. It was one of my sons telling me that his twin brother had had a heart attack and was in surgery. I still have a lot of friends in the airline industry, so I knew I would be able to book the NFO from JFK to LAX. That would have given me a little over 2 hours to get packed and to the airport. I called a few friends and found that I would be lucky enough to get someone to stay at my house for however long it would take me to return. <br /><br />Since then I have been looking for a place that I could contact 24/7 to have my pups taken in in the event of another emergency. I am not even thinking about another incident with one of my children, I am thinking more of myself. <br /><br />I visited http://www.evasplaypups.com/ and read:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At Eva&#039;s Play Pups, we provide 24 hour loving care and supervision as well as around the clock emergency veterinary care if needed. As long as we know your pooch will be kind to his or her fellow boarding mates, they are welcome to sleep out anywhere they like in our facility - on the sofa, in the bed with our overnight staff, on a bench or even just on the floor on a comfy Mutt Matt!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> So, I wanted to ascertain if there really was a 24 presence on site. Having someone there, who is sleeping in a bed, used to dogs barking and jumping on them, is not the kind of facility that would offer me any comfort. Having someone there who does not answer a ringing telephone, and does not respond to any messages left, is quite disturbing to me. <br /><br />I have had medical emergencies that put me in the hospital for a few days. I&#039;ve had outpatient surgery that left me totally helpless/incapacitated for a week of 24 hour private duty nursing home care. I would very much like to find a pet care facility that can take in my pups when I need them to be taken care of. Medical emergencies simply cannot be scheduled during regular business hours!

				I&#039;m curious to hear more about Eva&#039;s.&nbsp; Even though I don&#039;t need anyone now, it&#039;s good to have back up options just in case. I agree with homeowner that the person who stays overnight is not answering phones probably because they&#039;re not supposed to.&nbsp; But I would ask to make sure.&nbsp; And no Mac I don&#039;t think that just because someone wants to call at midnight, some employee HAS to answer the phone.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the policy is that the dogs are taken care of 24 hours a day that&#039;s not the same thing as as saying a person has to answer phone calls 24 hours a day.&nbsp; And yeah, emergencies happen in the middle of the night but that doesn&#039;t mean a business has to be open to deal with them IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO BE.&nbsp; I&#039;m a huge believer that people have the right to live their lives, run their business any way they want.&nbsp; If their policy doesn&#039;t fit into your needs or anyone else&#039;s for that matter, go else where.&nbsp; But you come off so strident and argumentative some times.&nbsp; For God&#039;s sake, I can&#039;t believe you kept calling as many times as you did.&nbsp; And if you wanted to know why no one was answering the phone, why didn&#039;t you just call them during their business hours and politely ask.&nbsp; They may have given you an explanation or said they have a different number you could call for emergencies. But you get all huffy and ready to fight.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that exhausting?<br />&nbsp;

				So our dog stayed at Eva&#039;s for 3 nights.&nbsp; He must have had a lot of fun running around because he slept all next day at home and then back to his usual hyper self.&nbsp; My only dislike is that he greeted us with pee smelly paws and in need of a serious bath which indicates to me that clean-up at the place could be improved.&nbsp; But in the end, I&#039;d rather have him running around dirty than crated and isolated.&nbsp; I plan on boarding him there again but will probably request that they give him a bath during the middle of his stay.&nbsp; Oh, and while out of town, I called Eva&#039;s and they gave me an update, so the communication is there.

				More on Long Island City&#039;s Camp Bow Wow (http://www.campbowwow.com/us/ny/longislandcity%2Dnyc/) from the <strong>Queens Gazette.</strong><br /><br /><strong>The Queens Gazette</strong><br />Camp Bow Wow Is Worth Barking About (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2008/0820/features/040.html)<br />BY VICTORIA CHU<br /><br />The camp counselors watch over the campers as they frolic through the six giant play yards. Some take a dip in the two pools available, while others run through the jungle gym. After the campers spend a long day playing with their friends, the camp counselors give them special &quot;campfire&quot; treats before tucking them into bed. Then the counselors play classical music that lulls even the most excited camper off to sleep to get ready for another fun-filled day.<br /><br />There&#039;s one distinct difference between the camp described and any other resident camp: the campers are dogs.<br /><br />Big and small, long haired and short haired, all dogs, with the exception of pit bulls, are welcome to have the time of their lives at the newly opened Camp Bow Wow in Long Island City. As long as they are at least four months old, spayed or neutered if over six months old, flea and tick free and current on vaccinations for Bordatella, distemper and rabies, the dogs can all enjoy Camp Bow Wow&#039;s 10,000- square-foot facility located at 47-16 Austell Pl. in Long Island City.<br /><br />Stephen Neagus opened the facility just over two weeks ago and already has more than 50 clients. He owned a dog-walking service for six years, saving money for a bigger and better project. Neagus saw an advertisement for Camp Bow Wow, a franchise based in Colorado, and eventually opened his own branch a year later, the first Camp Bow Wow in New York state. The campers come from many Queens neighborhoods, including Astoria, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Long Island City, Roosevelt Island, Sunnyside and Woodside. Neagus is currently considering opening another facility, perhaps in Manhattan, and other camps will be opening at other New York locations such as Staten Island in the near future. Ironically, Neagus owns only cats. &quot;I spend all day with dogs,&quot; Neagus explained. &quot;There would be no one to take care of my dogs while I&#039;m at work.&quot;<br /><br /><strong><em>Follow above link for complete story.</em></strong>

				We &quot;interviewed&quot; at Camp Bow Wow today. It was really nice and clean (well, they *have* only been open for 6 weeks) and the people were incredibly nice. They have an amazing space (the GM took us on a tour of the facility) and a good staff-to-dog ratio (15:1), though when we were there, I don&#039;t think there were more than 10 dogs. The kennels are a very nice size, and dogs are only in them for meals, &quot;naps&quot; and bed- the rest of the time they are in two areas- an &quot;outdoor&quot; area and an &quot;indoor&quot; area. Their whole facility is indoor, but each dog area- small, medium and large- has a section that&#039;s cement (indoor) and sand/gravel (I&#039;m not sure which) area that has a small pool (outdoor). <br /><br />The people who worked there were extremely nice and dedicated; and our dog seemed to have a great time. We checked up on him a few times via webcam (addictive), and when we picked him up (interview day is free!) we got a &quot;report card&quot; of his activities. When it eases into winter, and the dog parks aren&#039;t someplace we want to spend a ton of time, I think it will be really good place for our dog to get some socialization and exercise! <br /><br />Their prices seem a bit more than Eva&#039;s ($32 v. $28/day), but I think that might even out eventually- there&#039;s no charge for food, etc. (though we would provide our own food)- plus, if you buy packages it ends up being the same (though I didn&#039;t check if Eva&#039;s had a similar policy). There is *not* someone on premise the whole night, but for me, that&#039;s not an issue. Our dog came home happy and pooped, so I walked away quite content!

				Our pup was interviewed at Camp Bow Wow, and we were very impressed with the facilities and the staff. So many other borders we&#039;ve taken him to don&#039;t give him the attention that Camp Bow Wow did. They even gave us a follow up phone call to check in on him and see how his first stay was. We were very pleased and already scheduled a stay over Thanksgiving when we&#039;ll be out of town. Highly recommended!

				Here&#039;s another recommendation for Camp Bow Wow. Blackjack loves it! Like Abee&#039;s dog, he came home exhausted from his interview day. We also checked in on him several times via webcam (Yes, it is addictive!) and he was having a ball. We brought him back for their grand opening party and he had a blast again. (His team won the &quot;dunking for hot dogs&quot; contest.&nbsp; ;D ) He&#039;s going to be staying over with them this Saturday night. When you consider that the $50 overnight rate includes two days of &quot;doggie daycare&quot; (pick up by 6:00 PM on Sunday), it&#039;s really quite reasonable.

				We were at the grand opening too! Wasn&#039;t it cute? We&#039;re finally using them again tomorrow night for an overnight visit. I&#039;m just so impressed with their level of care and attention. When we went to the grand opening, Elizabeth- one of the owners, recognized us (and more importantly, our dog!) right away and came over to say hello, even though that was the first time we visited since the interview. They are such nice people!

				I stand firmly by my recommendation for Camp Bow Wow. I know exactly what I need with regard to dog care and they satisfy those needs. The web cam provides much more than fun entertainment. It provides an inside look at what your dog is doing as well as what care and supervision is being provided. We used this feature to evaluate the suitability of Camp Bow Wow for Blackjack&#039;s needs before we ever went through their doors. Naturally, we also use it when he is in their care. What we invariably see is staff either in the play areas with the dogs or immediately outside the play areas. We have seen them intervene when they judge that play may be becoming too rough and we have seen them also provide frequent hands-on affection to the dogs in their care. A web cam is the best alternative to actually being on the premises and watching your dog play in person. <br /><br />Blackjack himself provides evidence of how well Camp Bow Wow is satisfying his needs. Although he normally walks nicely at heel &amp; sits waiting to be invited before passing through doorways, he pulls at the leash as we approach their facility. As we said earlier, he loves it!<br /><br />I feel that the subject of inoculations is a bit off topic and would have been better addressed in a separate thread where opposition to inoculation might not be seen as self-promotional. Nevertheless, since it has been brought up here, I feel compelled to respond. As someone who lost a puppy in the past to distemper (he was infected before receiving the vaccine), spends a considerable amount of time in the woods upstate (i.e., possible rabies exposure), and who allows my dog frequent access to other canines, his health and well being is of primary concern. Both the North Shore Animal League &amp; our private vet recommend inoculations, including semiannual bordatella. However, since the recent posts did cause me concern, I asked a friend who is a vet in New Hampshire to comment. The following is his response:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi, Brian.<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid the poster you quoted is a bit off-base.<br /><br />1. Bordatella vaccination is given one of two routes- intranasal (drops in the nose) or injection.&nbsp; I personally prefer injection, but both routes are safe.&nbsp; I have never heard of the vaccine causing lymphoma.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Dogs get lymphoma as a result of genetics (some breeds are prone to it), or just as a case of shit happens.&nbsp; Just like people.&nbsp; <br /><br />2. Bordatella (kennel cough) is basically &quot;croup&quot; for dogs... infectious tracheobronchitis.&nbsp; It spreads like wildfire in a doggie daycare or kennel.&nbsp; I vaccinate dogs yearly for it.&nbsp; Some kennels require vaccination every six months!&nbsp; (I personally do not, but I will give the vaccine twice a year if the facility requests it).<br /><br />3. I don&#039;t believe in Every Single Dog getting Every Single Vaccine yearly.&nbsp; There are a few new 3 year vaccines which have been released (canine distemper vaccine and canine/feline rabies vaccine)... After the first year, I begin putting dogs on a 3 year vaccination protocol for these specific shots.<br /><br />4. Some vaccines require yearly administration... Lyme vaccination, Bordatella vaccination, Leptospirosis.&nbsp; Those I give yearly, every year, after evaluating each dog on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; a hunting dog in NH that spends a lot of time outside but is never sent to doggie daycare, I would recommend Lyme, Lepto, rabies (by law), and 3 year distemper.&nbsp; I would not require kennel cough vax.&nbsp; A shih-tzu couch potato that never goes outside and has been litter box trained, I would recommend rabies (by law), distemper, and kennel cough vaccination (because everyone knows those dogs will get boarded if the owner goes on vacation).<br /><br />Unfortunately, there&#039;s a lot of folks on the internet with an agenda to push... namely that veterinarians are in a conspiracy to over-vaccinate pets because of being greedy, or that vaccines cause cancer (or any disease of the week).&nbsp; Bottom line:&nbsp; I vaccinate my own personal animals with the same schedule and frequency using the same products.&nbsp; If anything I was using was tied to cancer, I simply wouldn&#039;t use it.<br /><br />Example- certain feline distemper FVRCP vaccines have a higher than normal rate of causing cancer at an injection site (any vaccine administered to a cat could possibly do it, but the odds are minuscule).&nbsp; Some, however, have been implicated with having higher rates of vaccine induced sarcomas.&nbsp; I refuse to administer those.<br /><br />There are some vaccines out there which I believe are worthless.&nbsp; And you can QUOTE me on this.&nbsp; Giardia vaccine, Ringworm vaccine.&nbsp; Feline Infectious Peritonitis vaccine.&nbsp; Those are all a No Go at my station.&nbsp; A veterinarian that recommends them is either working for a corporation that requires them or hasn&#039;t done their research.&nbsp; Period.<br /><br />Of course, I get to make my own rules about vaccines because I own my own veterinary hospital.&nbsp; However, these guidelines I&#039;ve described are common practice among modern veterinarians.&nbsp; I meet a lot of people who believe that you shouldn&#039;t vaccinate your pets... or children.&nbsp; And now polio is re-emerging as an infectious disease in the world.&nbsp; I occasionally see parvovirus because people don&#039;t get the early puppy shots when the dogs turn 6-8 weeks old because they thought &quot;their dog weren&#039;t exposed to it&quot; in the environment.<br /><br />Most of the stuff you read on the internet is a personal opinion of the person posting it and cannot be backed up with double-blinded scientific trials and solid data, even if they say &quot;it&#039;s common knowledge.&quot;&nbsp; If someone tells you that you&#039;ve been raising dogs wrong for the last twenty years and THEIR way is the one true right way, why should you believe them without solid data?<br /><br />But then again, I&#039;m a scientist and not a member of a conspiracy.&nbsp; I hope this helps.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I know exactly what I need with regard to dog care and they satisfy those needs. The web cam provides much more than fun entertainment. It provides an inside look at what your dog is doing as well as what care and supervision is being provided. We used this feature to evaluate the suitability of Camp Bow Wow for Blackjack&#039;s needs before we ever went through their doors. Naturally, we also use it when he is in their care. What we invariably see is staff either in the play areas with the dogs or immediately outside the play areas. We have seen them intervene when they judge that play may be becoming too rough and we have seen them also provide frequent hands-on affection to the dogs in their care. A web cam is the best alternative to actually being on the premises and watching your dog play in person. <br /><br />Blackjack himself provides evidence of how well Camp Bow Wow is satisfying his needs. Although he normally walks nicely at heel &amp; sits waiting to be invited before passing through doorways, he pulls at the leash as we approach their facility. As we said earlier, he loves it!<br /><br />I feel that the subject of inoculations is a bit off topic and would have been better addressed in a separate thread where opposition to inoculation might not be seen as self-promotional. Nevertheless, since it has been brought up here, I feel compelled to respond. As someone who lost a puppy in the past to distemper (he was infected before receiving the vaccine), spends a considerable amount of time in the woods upstate (i.e., possible rabies exposure), and who allows my dog frequent access to other canines, his health and well being is of primary concern. Both the North Shore Animal League &amp; our private vet recommend inoculations, including semiannual bordatella. However, since the recent posts did cause me concern, I asked a friend who is a vet in New Hampshire to comment. The following is his response:<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><em>Hi, Brian,<br /><br />I&#039;m glad that Camp Bow Wow is working out so well for you and Blackjack.&nbsp; I hope that it continues to serve your needs.&nbsp; For a variety of reasons, however, it may not serve the needs of other dogs or satisfy the requirements of every dog-person, and options are always nice.<br /><br />What I can offer, by way of response to your assessment of the overall quality of what this venue provides, is to tell you that you, as a kennel customer, present your (limited) experience, whereas I, as a dog-care professional, with extensive experience, going back decades, present the benefit of cumulative information, from a vast variety of sources.&nbsp; I will also assert that unless you are a behaviorist, a qualified dog-care provider, or an experienced dog handler, you have no way of recognizing &quot;risky business&quot;, when you observe it.&nbsp; You have also made mention of &quot;intervention&quot;, in situations that were becoming aggressive - - but then what?&nbsp; You have not told us what their solution is, in this situation.<br /><br />You have only commented on a single aspect of the Camp Bow Wow offerings, that being the dogs running around a great deal, which seems to please you entirely.&nbsp; But you do not mention many other things that are crucial to proper dog care.&nbsp; Since we are talking so much about how much the dogs *run around* - - WHAT - - for example - - ARE THEIR PROTOCOLS AROUND THE ISSUE OF *BLOAT*?&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you know anything *about* bloat, and how common it is in connection with *kennels*?&nbsp; Do you know how important cleanliness of feed and water pans is?&nbsp; How and when, what temperature, and what amount, of *water* is given to a dog that&#039;s been exercised that way?&nbsp; When, relative to such exercise, dogs may be *fed*, without incurring risk?&nbsp; What are the feeding protocols?&nbsp; What are the sleeping arrangements / supervision?&nbsp; What do the dogs do when they&#039;re *not* running around, and how and where and in what way do they do it?<br /><br />You come forth with your one instance, regarding your, individual, dog.&nbsp; I bring the knowledge accrued by association with *thousands* of dogs and case histories.&nbsp; How do you compare that?&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a *neighborhood*-oriented website, but have this discussion on a *dog*-oriented site, and at the mention of &quot;kennels&quot;, &quot;bloat&quot;, or &quot;innoculations&quot;, the tragic horror stories would begin to *pour* in!&nbsp; I hear them all the time, because ot the business I&#039;m in.<br /><br />As I have caused you sufficient concern for you to have inquired with your vet, I feel that I owe you address of both your reply to what I wrote, and to your vet&#039;s response.<br /><br />And oh, my!&nbsp; First I must comment on something (else) that you might think should be in another thread - - but it is just a quickie response:&nbsp; the North Shore Animal League IS BY NO MEANS AN AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE ON *ANYTHING*!&nbsp; The North Shore Animal League is a *tax shelter* for the Lewett family, that owns part of the town of Port Washington, and among those who have done rescue (as I have, for over forty years) well-known to be outright charlatans, with a disgraceful record.&nbsp; The A.S.P.C.A., when under contract to the city, had a dossier on them as long as your arm (even though they then, incongrously, out of desperation, released purebreed animals to them - - and that is *another* story!).&nbsp; My personal experience with North Shore was that when they irresponsibly handed out animals to anyone at all who would take one, at one of their &#039;free-dinner-free-watch-free-tank-of-gas&#039; promotional come-ons, and those animals were then *dumped*, still wearing their North Shore tags, and North Shore was contacted, in regard to the return of these animals&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; *they patently refused to take them back*!<br /><br />That being said, I see that your veterinarian friend has attempted to discredit me &quot;a bit&quot;, but has, essentially, done a lot of hedging and double-talk, including condoning a harmful procedure, because it is &quot;common practice&quot;, yet has revealed a half-way admission of the veracity of what I have told you.<br /><br />As for the veterinary take on this subject, I see that this vet (whom, for the sake of clarity, I shall refer to as &quot;he&quot;, though it may very well be a woman; if so, my apologies) has been quite prudent and careful in rendering his response to your inquiry, and has misinformed more by condescention, casting of aspersion, and gross omission, than by flagrant untruth (although there is some of that, as well, particularly as regards Bordatella vaccine).&nbsp; This practitioner straddles the fence on the truth pertaining to the issue of vaccines, and suggests that I am an &quot;extremist&quot; (which I am *not*; I did not say that I object to innoculations; I object, with *&quot;scientific&quot;* reason, to *repeated*, *unnecessary* vaccines on an animal already with immunity; I object to *improperly administered* vaccines, and improper administration schedules that harm animals) to distract from the fact that he subtly and grudgingly *agrees*, to some extent, with what I have told you, to the degree that he will render an admission.&nbsp; It is a very non-definitive statement.&nbsp; I will not make the same.&nbsp; I will make definitice statements about those things that I know definately.<br /><br />Veterinarians make 24% of their yearly income on unnecessary innoculations, and who knows how much more as a result of the illnesses they cause.&nbsp; I do not.&nbsp; My business caters to the well-being of animals; it relies on *well* animals, not sick ones.&nbsp; Therefore, I have no vested interest in promoting harmful innoculations.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are also highly respected *homeopathic* veterinarians , surely also &quot;scientists&quot; - - an entire cadre of them, from Martin Goldstein on - - who would oppose such casual regard to the consequences of yearly, unnecessary, incorrectly- administered innoculations, and who would cite *comparative* analysis, of the number of animals that die of a disease, against the number who die as a result of the vaccinations for that disease.&nbsp; Surely your vet does not mean to discredit *those* *scientists* (Goldstein is a microbiologist).<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little SCIENCE lesson for you (run this by your vet):&nbsp; YOUR DOG CAN ONLY BE 100% IMMUNE TO SOMETHING.&nbsp; HE CANNOT BE ANY MORE THAN 100% IMMUNE TO ANYTHING.&nbsp; THERE IS *NO MORE* THAN *100%* IMMUNITY.&nbsp; *100%* IS *AS* *IMMUNE* AS YOU CAN BE.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said that four different ways, just to make sure you really *get* this.<br /><br />Now - - *that being the case* - - when your dog is 100% immune to something&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; *why* is your vet calling you in for a yearly innoculation for that?<br /><br />If your vet is your dog&#039;s health-care advocate, even if you beat his door down, *asking* for more shots - - *why* would he agree to administer them to an animal he *knows* has *100%* immunity to that disease, *particularly* when he *knows* that by doing so he hazards permanently damaging or destroying your animal&#039;s health?&nbsp; (And then charging you for that!)&nbsp; And *why* is your kennel participating in this unconscionable scam, that puts your dog at risk?&nbsp; (The reason is *self-interest* via *no* legal liability, based on *outdated* standards).&nbsp; Moreover, why would this vet allow a *kennel* to dictate health-care protocols to *him*, when *he* is a *veterinarian*???<br /><br />If your dog has had the standard vaccination series, even once, let alone twice and three times, or more - - HE IS *100% IMMUNE* TO THOSE DISEASES, and all you need to prove it is a yearly *BLOOD TITER* READING.&nbsp; Let any veterinarian contest this!<br /><br />As for Bordatella vaccine - - there most definitely *has* been a link found between intranasal application and the instance of lymphosarcoma, starting in the gland mass beneath the jaw, in even very young dogs, *not* &quot;genetically predisposed&quot;, and *why* is this vet vaccinating *&quot;yearly&quot;* for it when he has admitted that the vaccine onlly imparts a 6-month (alleged) &quot;immunity&quot;?&nbsp; Why vaccinate for it at *all*, then???&nbsp; Cha-ching, cha-ching!&nbsp; (That&#039;s the cash register you hear, folks!&nbsp; This is how vets are *trained* - - not only to practice medicine, but to do so in such a way as insures a thriving *business*).<br /><br />Regarding leptospirosis, the classic form of the disease does not require yearly re-administration.&nbsp; The *new* form of the disease, that emerged a few years ago, is something I alerted my clients to, and recommended innoculation for, with extreme care taken in proper administration, that being *no other vaccines given for at least ten days, if not two weeks, before or after that vaccine*.&nbsp; <br /><br />Considering the fact that one of the aspects of my profession is to stand in judgement of veterinary management, I am not surprised at all by the tone of this response.&nbsp; But I have been doing what I do for many years.&nbsp; I wonder how, relatively, experienced your vet friend is.&nbsp; &quot;Shit happens&quot; is a very poor disgnostic response from a medical practitioner.&nbsp; I do not pay my medical practitioners to tell me that &quot;shit happens&quot;.&nbsp; It most certainly *does*, particularly in the event of gross mismanagement of care.&nbsp; Then shit *really* happens.<br /><br />I am *not* a veterinarian.&nbsp; I do *not* have to lie to protect or justify the protocols of the veterinary profession.&nbsp; I have no interest in pushing unnecessary, injurious, costly veterinary procedures, and I have not been trained to include harmful practices to ensure vigorous business.<br /><br />Perhaps this veterinarian has missed the fact that I am an animal behaviorist, when he refers to &quot;scientists&quot; versus &quot;a member of a conspiracy&quot;; surely a veterinarian would understand that my branch of *science* requires a through knowledge and understanding of *all* matters pertaining to the animal, *starting*, first and foremost, with the *health* and *nutrition* of the animal, and issues thereof.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is not a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to be up-to-date in clinical knowledge, in the best interests of the subject of that knowledge, for which one advocates, and to educate the relevant public, in regard to these matters.&nbsp; Accusers of &quot;conspiracy&quot; assume an adversarial position to challenge, frequently because they have something to conceal.&nbsp; Abuse, and generation of business by unnecessary innoculation, is the veterinary industry&#039;s dirtiest little secret.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take my word for it; check out the subject yourself, in something of substance, for the layman, like the Whole Dog Journal, a highly competent and significantly respected publication, that would be difficult to discredit as being &quot;conspiracy propaganda&quot;.<br /><br />But, whatever you do - - remember the vital questions: &quot;IF MY DOG IS 100% IMMUNE TO THESE DISEASES, *WHY* DO YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM MORE SHOTS?&quot;&nbsp; And, &quot;IF YOU GIVE HIM MORE SHOTS, HOW MUCH *MORE* IMMUNE WILL HE *BE* THAN 100%?&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; And ask them of your vet, next time yearly innoculation time rolls around.&nbsp; <br /><br />THEN - - *ASK FOR A *BLOOD TITER* PANEL, INSTEAD - - and you will see, by the antibody readings, that your animal needs NO MORE SHOTS, and nothing more than that yearly blood titer to prove immunity.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for dog care facilities - - anyone who is worthy of your trust should be sufficiently concerned about the animals they care for, to be knowledgeable, and *currently* informed.&nbsp; That means that they should be asking for nothing more than a BLOOD TITER panel, for dogs that have already been immunized.<br /><br />People should not be compelled to put their dogs at serious and unnecessary risk in order to board them; it&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; It is unnecessary, it is irresponsible, and it is not in the best interests of the clients (or, customers, in the case of a kennel, as opposed to a service business), canine or human.<br /><br />Finally, regarding the assertion of &quot;self-promotion&quot;, I most certainly *do* promote myself!&nbsp; I am one of the most competent, qualified people in my field of endeavor, and I see no reason to be coy about this, or to be shy about offering my services.&nbsp; I know what I offer clients, and, most importantly, as this is my primary interest, their dogs.&nbsp; I am *not* in competition with boarding kennels.&nbsp; I run a *service* business, with which boarding kennels cannot in any way compare.&nbsp; Boarding kennels are commercial operations; they have *customers*; my business serves *clients*.&nbsp; There is a great difference.<br /><br />I want people to know the options that exist for them, and how to make informed decisions.<br /><br />Given the many years that I have devoted to the well-being and humane treatment of animals, and the caliber of the business that I run, those who know me understand very well why I am self-confident, and always, first and foremost, acting in the best interests of those animals I serve, that being the mission statement of my practice.&nbsp; I run a full-service business, where I *teach* my clients how to read a dog food label, what to expect by way of vet care, how to ascertain the quality of those businesses and practices that serve them and their dogs.<br /><br />As for *any*thing &quot;spreading like wildfire&quot;, this has never occured in (either my erstwhile rescue facility or in ) my home, in the many years that I have cared for animals - - and that is not a matter of lucky happenstance, but of expertise, conscientious attention and effort, and immaculate protocols.<br /><br />The only &quot;agenda&quot; I have, to &quot;push&quot; is the well-being of creatures who cannot speak for themselves, that they not be exploited in cruel ways, for convenience or the sake of someone&#039;s pocketbook.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to make animals *sick* to make my living; I make a decent living *advocating* for them.<br /><br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; If anyone wishes to cast aspersions on my credibility?&nbsp; First - - find something I&#039;m *wrong* about!&nbsp; &nbsp; </em>

				I have nothing to prove, am not by any means a dog expert, am not affiliated with any camp here (no pun intended), and have not been trying to fight. I was simply offering my stance on my singular anecdotal experience. I am done with providing that opinion and will not be turning in for &quot;part two&quot;. Don&#039;t worry, I have not been offended and do not have anything against boarding your dog in a home with a highly qualified professional if that is what works best for you. If I have in any way implied that was bad, I apologize. I&#039;m out of this conversation. Bye.

- - PART 2<br /><br />As I have been confronted with the assertion that I know &quot;nothing&quot; about a specific venue that has become the topic of this discussion, and I, in return, have accused some of you of not doing your &quot;homework&quot;, I felt it fair to do a little research on CBW; research that took me all of *five* minutes, to find the truth about the operation of this establishment (that you, too, can research for yourselves, in the same five minutes; you don&#039;t have to take my word for anything).<br /><br />The results of my five minutes of research were quite disturbing, but not uncommon.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take a look; shall we?&nbsp; (And I&#039;ll play this backward, just to keep it interesting, as a mystery should be).<br /><br />&quot;Camp Bow Wow - - North America&#039;s Premier Doggy-Day And Overnight Camp&quot;, is the header on the homepage of the Long Island City CBW website.&nbsp; And let&#039;s STOP RIGHT THERE for a moment, to examine this claim!<br /><br />WHO says this about them?&nbsp; Other than the *hype* that they, themselves, generate, WHO makes this claim about CBW?&nbsp; (And, by what criteria, in any case?!).&nbsp; *NO ONE*!&nbsp; NO ONE says this about them, other than themselves!&nbsp; There is *NO* ENDORSEMENT to back this spurious claim!&nbsp; *No* humane society, *no* animal-advocacy organization, *no*animal-oriented association, no animal-oriented publication!&nbsp; ABSOLUTELY NO ONE connected with anything that has anything to do with *animals*.<br /><br />They, further, say that they have been &quot;featured in newspapers, magazines, and on television shows&quot;, as &quot;a wonderful alternative to the traditional kennel&quot; (I, personally, fail to see the difference).&nbsp; BUT THEY DON&#039;T SAY *WHICH ONES*!!!&nbsp; *WHAT* newspapers?&nbsp; *WHAT* magazines?&nbsp; *WHAT* t.v. shows?&nbsp; Do you know how quick and eager commercial businesses are to cite specifics, in regard to such things, when they have something to tell, and names to drop?&nbsp; Holy cow!&nbsp; This is *why* businesses seek publicity - - so that they can promote themselves with it - - *specifically* and *by name*!!&nbsp; *WHY* would *this* business make such claims - - yet be so vague?&nbsp; The mystery deepens!&nbsp; Until you look into their &quot;PRESS&quot; section.&nbsp; But let&#039;s save that, for a moment; shall we?<br /><br />First, let&#039;s go back and look again at that home page, and what it advertises, which is contrary to one of the issues we&#039;ve been discussing:&nbsp; bloat.&nbsp; They say that they feature *&quot;ALL DAY PLAY&quot;*, and they show, in one photo shot, a small, inflatable, child&#039;s wading pool, filled with water.&nbsp; For all intents and purposes, that&#039;s some big, available water dish, probably loaded with bacteria, too, and BANG!&nbsp; Your &quot;bloat protocol&quot; is dead!&nbsp; The lecture and the handout on the subject?&nbsp; That&#039;s *their* liability disclaimer; demonstrably, it has no bearing on the true nature of the situation, or care of your dog.&nbsp; (Add a little something, here: Giardia.&nbsp; Small, common pools like these can be a hotbed of Giardia.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re not lucky, *you* and your dog can get to share something known as &quot;ping-pong Giardia&quot;!&nbsp; What fun!!).<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look into that &quot;Press&quot; section on that website, and see where those mentionable &quot;features&quot; have been.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve pointed out, there haven&#039;t been any endorsements from any sort of *dog* or *animal* associations; with all their elaborate internet *crap*, they fail to be endorsed by ONE valid source - - so what &quot;newspapers&quot;, &quot;magazines&quot;, and &quot;television shows&quot; are they talking about?<br /><br />And it&#039;s just *UNBELIEVABLE*!&nbsp; *ALL* of their &quot;press&quot; has been in *BUSINESS* publications!!!!!!!&nbsp; NOWHERE are they touted as animal-care specialists - - - but as *BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS*!&nbsp; <br /><br />They are referred to as a &quot;franchise SYSTEM&quot;; they&#039;re an &quot;industrial&quot; system, that boasts &quot;over 200 CBWs across the country!&nbsp; (All staffed by *incompetents*!!&nbsp; HOW do I know this?&nbsp; No one competent would work in a system like this!).&nbsp; <br /><br />All you see on their websites is the word &quot;BUSINESS&quot;, over and over again!&nbsp; *They&#039;re selling FRANCHISE BUSINESSES*; *that* is their primary interest, not dog care!&nbsp; That is what their websites are designed for.&nbsp; That is what their de facto businesses are designed for.&nbsp; They are a *pyramid* operation!&nbsp; (More on this, shortly).<br /><br />And it gets better.&nbsp; Curtis Moore, the guy behind this &quot;entrepreneurial business&quot; is a retired marketing strategy / entrepreneurship expert from Lucent, a giant technologies conglomerate.&nbsp; He worked there until 1996.&nbsp; He is assisted in his endeavors by his wife, who retired from MCI Technologies in the year 2000.&nbsp; NEITHER OF THESE PEOPLE WERE IN ANY PROFESSIONAL FIELD CONNECTED WITH ANIMAL OR DOG CARE, *EVER*.&nbsp; (Except for a summer, long ago, during which this character worked as a kennel-boy).&nbsp; HIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE IS NOT ANIMAL CARE, BUT BUSINESS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES.<br /><br />But that&#039;s not all.&nbsp; He has some very interesting side-line businesses, that may shed some light on the operations of CBW, as a corporate entity.&nbsp; *Brian, pay attention; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be thrilled!*<br /><br />If you follow the very clear and frank path (this guy isn&#039;t hiding anything; he relies on your ignorance; he&#039;s right in your face, and insulting your intelligence!) you will find that he is also running a *puppy mill*!&nbsp; That&#039;s right!&nbsp; He breeds poor specimens of lousy, probably unsound, dogs (Bichons [unrecognizable as Bichons, by the way; looking like Maltese!] and Corgis) that are not exhibited (shown) or tested for genetic disease.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t go to the trouble or *EXPENSE* of having good stock, or exhibiting his dogs, but he does charge the unaware and unwary &quot;show quality&quot; prices for them!&nbsp; AND, he boasts, on his website, that he uses *Diamond* dog food (the very first brand to poison so many dogs, with terrible ingredients from China!) - - *meaning* that *he doesn&#039;t even so much as pay to *feed* his puppy-mill dogs*; for that mention, he gets his feed without charge from the company that makes it!&nbsp; (I&#039;m liking this guy less and less!).<br /><br />But it&#039;s not over yet!!!&nbsp; Because our CBW developer has yet another sideline business he&#039;s been working on!&nbsp; He&#039;s cashing in on the craze for organic beef, by breeding &quot;organic&quot; Lowline Black Angus cattle, for consumption!!!&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; know what &quot;organic&quot; means, when you live in Texas, and you&#039;re raising cattle?&nbsp; It means that they live outdoors and eat grass, which grows for *free* in the great state of Texas, where there&#039;s hardly any winter, and the costs of such an operation amount to not much more than the cost of the land itself, yet have high yields in the marketplace!&nbsp; (While we&#039;re at it, for those who think &quot;green&quot;, raising cattle is one of the most exploitative, planet-violating things you can do!). <br /><br />So - - a pattern emerges:&nbsp; here we have someone (who specializes in *marketing strategy* and *entrepreneurial development*) who runs three separate businesses that all *EXPLOIT* animals, and makes his income at the *expense* of animals.&nbsp; And his crowning achievement, thus far, is CBW, cited and written up, for being a marvelous entrepreneurial pyramid-system franchise *industry*, that has generated &quot;over 200 locations across the country&quot;, since 1996, started with income from his puppy mill (the &quot;breeding program&quot; referred to in the warm, fuzzy story of how Moore turned certain aspects of his business over to his wife, when she retired, in 2000).&nbsp; <br /><br />Returning to the issue of Mr. Moore, and CBW&#039;s press, I would direct you to the coverage that they&#039;ve gotten on Merchant&#039;sCircle - - *not* &#039;DogCircle&#039;, or &#039;AnimalCircle&#039; - - *MERCHANT&#039;s*Circle.&nbsp; (It&#039;s always about business, never about dogs!).&nbsp; And there we have a videotape, from YouTube - - CBW&#039;s *advertisement*!&nbsp; As such, the *BEST* view of their business that they have to offer!&nbsp; Take a look at that, and I&#039;ll be back soon with my assessment of that video, and the final chapter (and it isn&#039;t good news). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s time to get this thread back on track after it was so annoyingly hijacked.<br /><br />Anyway, over the Thanksgiving holiday, my friends put their dog into Eva&#039;s boarding place in Brooklyn.&nbsp; They had friends who were happy so decided to give it a try.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was so over crowded, due to the holiday, that they felt their dog was lost in the shuffle.&nbsp; I think they said Eva&#039;s had to board some of the dogs somewhere else because of over crowding.&nbsp; That may have been just a holiday thing but I would check to see how many dogs are going to be boarded at the time I have to leave my dog.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now this Christmas another friend put her toy poodle in a boarding place.&nbsp; After the holiday, I&#039;ll find out how that went.&nbsp; I think, it&#039;s PAWS, but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m remembering the name correctly. Anyway, it&#039;s in the City.&nbsp; To be continued......
