					I just want to alert everyone about this if you don&#039;t already know:<br /><br />There is an ongoing pattern of burglaries in our area.&nbsp; They hit 4 apartments in a building at 82nd and 37th on Saturday night March 8th and the night before they hit a building at 83nd and 37th. They pry open fire escape windows or make entry through open windows.&nbsp; <br /><br />These tend to be occurring in the evening hours just after dark.&nbsp; The police think the scumbags are accessing roofs and making their way down the fire escapes to look for empty apartments and open windows or windows not reinforced for security.&nbsp; <br />Basically everyone needs to reinforce their fire escape windows. Just get one of those security bars that extends between the frames on the inside.&nbsp; They&#039;ll probably just see it and move on.&nbsp; Also, leave lights on and maybe a radio so it appears someone is inside.&nbsp; They&#039;re looking for empty apartments so if someone appears to be home they&#039;ll probably just move on.<br />Hoping they get busted soon.&nbsp;

					I&#039;m pretty sure a business like a pizzeria can ask the city to make food vendors move from right in front of their business. Not totally unreasonable.&nbsp; I do love how it took Famiglia about 3 years to open, I wonder what the deal was with that? I can&#039;t imagine ever getting food there, the taco trucks are delicious. I didn&#039;t move here to eat subpar chain pizza. If you want good pizza go to Louie&#039;s on Baxter Ave.&nbsp; The Sabor cart that used to be there has been replaced by a larger truck which is usually parked a block East on the same side of Roosevelt. I don&#039;t know if the truck says Sabor on it but it is undoubtedly the same food and same people working. (can you tell I eat lots of tacos?)&nbsp; Gallo Giro is another block further East, same side of Roosevelt.&nbsp;

					So....because I haven&#039;t been able to watch either the Knicks or Rangers since the first of the year AND because they&#039;ve started charging me near 150 a month for standard Roadrunner and 1 cable box with basic service and no movie channels I wanted to dump Time Warner.&nbsp; I was about to place an order for Verizon/DirectTV when&nbsp; I was informed by my super that he could not provide roof access to the installer because my building management company only allows Time Warner in this building and has had this policy in place for many years.&nbsp; &nbsp;How is it possible that I can SEE Direct TV dishes on the roof next to me, but I&#039;m not allowed to switch? Has anyone else had this problem? I&#039;m honestly pretty aggravated that my building management company can ban me from selecting the TV provider I want.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if Time Warner knew this when I called them up...it would totally explain the pay up or f**k off attitude they gave me when I called because my promotional pricing had expired.&nbsp;

					There are a number of statements from that News article that don&#039;t really make much sense.&nbsp; First of all...I realize that parking is an issue around here, but if people are really traveling from out of state to shop here am I to believe that the loss of 20 spots means they drive out, get frustrated and just turn around and go home?? Second, the business owner quoted in the article states that the pedestrian area is both a deserted &quot;ghost town&quot; and filthy with garbage.&nbsp; Well, clearly the garbage didn&#039;t just appear....someone is using the area, so it&#039;s not exactly a ghost town.&nbsp; This pedestrian area is great, it just needs to be fully implemented with more garbage cans, trees and some benches like it&#039;s part of the green streets thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, if that guy opens a supermarket and food court on that block i&#039;ll be eating there regularly.&nbsp;

					I can shed some light on this as I work for an auction company that does business like this.&nbsp; Generally we handle bankruptcy and public administrator auctions so a straight foreclosure might be slightly different. Here&#039;s how for example a bankruptcy property auction would work...The debtor either vacates the unit immediately or is given until the date of the auction to vacate.&nbsp; We, the auction company would generally take photos of the unit, post them online along with the terms of the auction, bylaws of the co-op and other pertinent documents. We&#039;d also usually schedule at least two times where people could come and look at the place like an open house.&nbsp; Next the unit goes to auction.&nbsp; In the case of bankruptcy auctions the high bid is subject to the approval of the trustee....for a foreclosure I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s at the discretion of the bank. (So this should cover the &quot;if the bid is too low&quot;)&nbsp; Also, any time we&#039;ve ever auctioned a co-op the high bidder is subject to the approval of the co-op board before the sale can go through.&nbsp; (and this should cover &quot;if the buyer is a corporation&quot;)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly wouldn&#039;t be too concerned with this situation...sadly it happens all the time whether it be foreclosures, bankruptcies, public administrator properties, guardian ordered etc etc.&nbsp;

					Ok,&nbsp; So I&#039;ve had Time Warner for about a year now and I&#039;m at that point where they jack up your bill because the promotional pricing is over.&nbsp; I have no premium movie channels or anything and they want to increase my bill for internet and TV from 115 a month to around 140....and of course add to that the fact that I haven&#039;t been able to watch a Knicks or Rangers game since the first of the year.&nbsp; <br />I contacted Verizon and they can offer me non-FIOS Enhanced High Speed Internet (DSL) and DirectTV for what seems like a much better deal.&nbsp; Does anyone have any experience with this service?? I&#039;m primarily concerned with the speed of the internet service compared to Roadrunner.<br /><br />IF anyone else is interested in this Verizon has offered me &quot;Enhanced High Speed Internet&quot; and DirectTV Premier for like 80 a month for the first year and about 110 a year for the second year.&nbsp; Both of these are less than I currently pay for Time Warner and Premier includes like every movie channel (HBO, Showtime etc) and a bunch of sports channels I currently don&#039;t get.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anyone has any helpful suggestions I would highly appreciate it.&nbsp;

					Thanks for the link.&nbsp; A sandwich shop is what it looked like to me, hopefully it&#039;s good.&nbsp; Such a gamble to open a business around here with the rents.&nbsp; Since i moved here I&#039;ve wanted to open a business on 37th Ave but when I started looking into rents they&#039;re outrageous...as has been discussed most recently regarding the departure of Rudy Volcano to the East Village.&nbsp; I have to hand it to some of these niche specialty stores I see on 37th....if they can make money with these crazy rents, good for them.&nbsp;

					Does anyone know what that new place on the North side of 37th Ave. is?&nbsp; It&#039;s in the location that used to be called Sophia&#039;s Jewelery?&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell what kind of place it is...looks like they&#039;re almost ready to open.

					I&#039;ve pretty much tried all the Chinese takeout in Jackson Heights and unless I missed something better I&#039;ve ended up going back to Woks on 37th Ave the most.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure everyone has an opinion on this but I think the food there is good.&nbsp; They have great boneless spare ribs.&nbsp;

					I agree...I go to the PF on Steinway St. in Astoria.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#039;ll jog or bike there but taking the subway to the gym is sort of annoying.&nbsp; Having a decent gym in the neighborhood would be awesome.

					Hey All,<br /><br />Just found this topic searching to see if anyone had thought of this and although old I&#039;ll reply.&nbsp; I go to the PF in Astoria and although I like it, I def think we could use one here in JH.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think the proximity to the Astoria location is really an issue, I know they have a number of locations out on the island really close together in areas that are waaay less densely populated.&nbsp; Even if it&#039;s fairly self serving to want a PF within close walking distance, I do really think it would be pretty successful here.&nbsp; I think one on Roosevelt Ave would be ideal because of the subway...I know they wanted some amount of parking spaces according to the website but you gotta figure that component goes out the window in NYC.&nbsp; Northern Blvd would also be a good idea.&nbsp; Bottom line is we don&#039;t have many gyms here and I feel like a 10 bucks a month gym would be pretty popular around here.&nbsp;
