				No wonder the property tax assessments for the historic district coops are increasing by 15% per year. <br />I&#039;m going to be priced out of living in this neighborhood soon.

				I live in a historic district coop and am unaware of any yearly 15 percent property tax increase. Do you have some sort of proof of that? Tax is part of our maintenance, which has not increased at all in the past 7 years. In the coop where we used to live--in Manhattan--the maintenance did go up every year. This has not been the case here in JH.&nbsp;

				As long as Roosevelt Ave exists in its current form, nice things in JH will be moderated by the nearby suck.

(It really should come as no surprise that property taxes are increasing when you consider that just 3-4 years ago it was possible to buy a post war one-bedroom in JH for $160K, and today you might be able to get a similar apartment in rough shape for just under $300K)&nbsp; Your coop may have found a way to avoid an increase in maintenance through other savings or generating income in another way (renting parking spaces, flip taxes, etc.). The place to look for that info is your coop&#039;s financial statements. The last one you probably have at this point is for 2016, and you can compare 2016 numbers to 2015.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an article from 2015 noting that 33 neighborhoods in NYC saw property taxes increase by 20%, so a 15% increase here doesn&#039;t seem that outlandish. I guess we&#039;ll all know for sure in a few months.<br />https://nypost.com/2015/01/16/city-property-tax-bills-soar-amid-surging-real-estate-market/ (https://nypost.com/2015/01/16/city-property-tax-bills-soar-amid-surging-real-estate-market/)<br />
