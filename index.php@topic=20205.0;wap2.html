			Hello!<br /><br />I am looking for a contractor or a knowledgeable handyman to do some interior and possible exterior work in a townhouse.<br />We need to re actor some windows to the structure and replace some interior drywall as well to sole a humidity issue. We will continue to make changes and reparations to the house so there is a big possibility for more work if interested.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Eduardo
