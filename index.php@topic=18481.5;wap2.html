			Yes, you can have one. Two people in my building have emotional support dogs and there is nothing the coop board can do about it so long as it is recommended by a doctor. <br /><br />If it is necessary, do it. And don&#039;t feel bad. Other people can have cats and screaming, stomping children, but you can&#039;t have a dog? please. enjoy
