				The best places to get good beer in the neighborhood are definitely UFC and Little Tibet. The latter has a pretty good (momo) burger too. Too bad, a burger at UFC is fast-food bad.

I&#039;ve had the burger at Sean Og&#039;s a few times and it is pretty good. In JH, though, I like the burgers at Jax Inn. <br /><br />My favorite burger: Jackson Hole on Astoria Blvd. It&#039;s totally worth the walk!

				I bet they do a good burger at Cuckoo&#039;s Nest, they do everything good. <br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t be impartial bc I work with them, but the Momo Burger at Little Tibet is made with grilled momo meat as the pattie, topped with tomato, frizzled onions, homemade mayo, inside a buttered, grilled, steamed tingmo. Forget being ethnic, it&#039;s a good burger, period. It&#039;s not on the menu, you have to ask for it. There are a few other secret menu items too, the ones I know are the desserts - Tsampa cake which is pretty much like pie crust with ice cream on top, and then this balled dough with paneer, butter, and sugar.

				Okay, regarding the Momo Burger ----- you have to go when they are not busy. There&#039;s no griddle so it has to be made in the wok, hhaha. Such a small kitchen...
