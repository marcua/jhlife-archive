				Dictatorship???<br /><br />That seems like a rather harsh word. <br /><br />But if you mean being able to say whatever you want, however you want, or whenever you want, that isn&#039;t politically correct either.

				this site is a long way from being a dictatorship -- and that is a term i&#039;d use for a couple of sites that i drifted away from because of moderators&#039; iron fists. i would agree that some people are a little too sensitive about debate, and that makes it a little less &quot;alive&quot; than i might like, but overall, it&#039;s very well run. <br /><br />(i&#039;m just sayin&#039;&nbsp; ;D)

				This is for Griswold Contessa and Really4rob...<br /><br />I have to admit that even I laughed at your responses. Yes, I do have a sense of humor.<br />But at least DSSJH &amp; Foxy Wiles made an attempt at a serious answer with a little tickle in the ribs - thank you ladies!<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s the &quot;jump on the bandwagon&quot; type of responses that would make people think that there is no PC here or a dictatorship.
