				&nbsp;https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/01/23/andy-byford-nyc-transit-president-resigns<br /><br />New York City Transit President Andy Byford announced Thursday he is stepping down from his post.<br /><br />The decision comes months after he had submitted a letter of resignation and then retracted it following reports of tension with Governor Andrew Cuomo, who oversees the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.<br /><br />In a statement, Byford said, &quot;I’m very proud of what we have achieved as a team over the past two years and I believe New York City Transit is well-placed to continue its forward progress now that the MTA has a record breaking $51.5 billion Capital Program in place. I’m very grateful to Governor Cuomo, Chairman Foye and members of the Board for giving me the opportunity to serve New York and to head up North America’s largest transit system.&quot;

				Oh man, my hopes were pinned on him, and I think he&#039;s made good progress over the past 2 years. The NYT implies that Cuomo is the reason he resigned, and I can believe that. That&#039;s not good news.

				i definitely pin it on Cuomo. he&#039;s a micro-manager, and that&#039;s the worst thing someone with thousands and thousands of projects to manage can be.

				He is probably tired being blamed for a system that is falling apart, cost overruns on repairs, faulty equipment, and the new bus elimination scheme. The MTA is looking to cut costs by eliminating service to politically disenfranchised neighborhoods. Look at the outrageous meetings he just went to.

				I thought he was doing well but I&#039;m sure working with idiots like Cuomo and DeBlasio was less than ideal.&nbsp; A big loss for NYC Transit.

				I have a feeling Andy Byford was the only one listening to and taking seriously complaints about the new Queens bus plan.<br /><br />And now he&#039;s gone, I&#039;m assuming any input from the community will fall on the deaf ears of the faceless committee now in charge of bus changes.<br /><br />

				Exactly, now that he is out of the picture, the MTA will implement service cuts without having an actual person responsible. Also there is the new committee looking to economically divide Queens from Manhattan by imposing the new “congestion pricing” that will impose a tale of two cities solution to traffic. I believe that Queens dollars will stay in Jackson Heights and other neighborhoods near Manhattan when many people vote with their feet to eat and drink locally.&nbsp; I predict many businesses in Manhattan will close six months after the plan is implemented.
