				Hi,<br />I&#039;ve been asked to contribute to a report on how various neighborhoods have fared during the pandemic. It doesn&#039;t seem to me that Jackson Heights has had A LOT of store/restaurant closings because of the pandemic -- am I mistaken? I&#039;m not saying no place has closed, but I wouldn&#039;t call it a &quot;rash&quot; of closings - like, there aren&#039;t a bunch of blocks with rows of empty storefronts. (Not counting ones that closed pre-pandemic.)<br />Please let me know if your impression differs, and which locations/businesses in particular you know shut down because of the pandemic.

				The most significant closing - for me, at least - was Farine, which wasn&#039;t able to pivot well enough for whatever reason. I think we may have lost fewer restaurants than most Manhattan neighborhoods because a good number of our eateries already relied heavily on takeout and delivery, rather than sitdown meals with extensive cocktail service. The latter element is a big part of the average mid to mid-high priced restaurant. I&#039;m happy to see that our nicer sitdown places - La Fusta, Armondo&#039;s come to mind - did survive. I&#039;d like to know how they weathered this.

				Until at least a few weeks ago, it seemed JH was actually thriving compared to most of MH. Between working from home, in addition to many Manhattanites and/or transplants decamping to second homes and/or hometowns, especially Midtown looked like a ghost town. Though that&#039;s recently changing again for the better there, our demographics here have apparently kept JH going more than other neighborhoods (IMHO).

				I have the same impression that thankfully JH seems to doing ok compared to the city. I work on the Upper East Side in Manhattan and there are over 50 empty stores on Madison Avenue alone from 76th To 56th Streets.<br />It’s very sad to walk around the city as it’s the same everywhere there. It’s so nice when getting off the 7 train after work to hear the lively music from the restaurants on Roosevelt Ave, the street venders on 82nd Street and the traffic and people on 37th Avenue with all the stores and restaurants opened!
