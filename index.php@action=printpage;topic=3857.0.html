				Hello neighbors!!!!<br /><br />OK, maybe you all can help me out here I was going to open a wine shop but, was beat to the punch... :&#039;(<br /><br />So, now I am going to the community to ask you what do you want to have hear that you will enjoy going too and shop. I have read some posts about too many hair/nail salons/pharmacies and I agree..<br /><br />I would love to have some feed back, after all it is our neighborhood, and has potential to roll back to what it use to be, after all JH rivaled Forest Hills. <br /><br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />77

				I was thinking a cheese shop with lot&#039;s of diversity would be lovely. A few other choice items- good mustards,<br />crackers and breads, teas, whatever. Or a real butcher with the same angle. Or a fish store. Seems like a <br />long shot but while you&#039;re asking- book store, quality shoe store and arty movie theatre. Sorry but it&#039;s so <br />close to Christmas I got carried away...

				How about a gyM or movie theatre. JH is in dire need of both! There are two movie theatre spaces and I think the empty retail space on northern in the 70&#039;s would make a great spot for a gym.

				A gym would be too costly the insurance I am certain would be killer, and to maintain the machines would be costly as well.<br /><br />In addition to the cheese what else you would like to see, I am sure an assortment of cracker&#039;s, how about caviar as well... I&nbsp; recently have become a fan and learned like wine caviar need not be expensive to enjoy!! <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t stop at that guys come on, what else....<br /><br />PS Chuckter thanks for the thread ;)<br /><br />Merry Christmas to all...<br /><br />77th

				If there is one business that Jackson Heights lacks and would be very successful is a gym. There isn&#039;t a decent gym in the entire neighborhood, but the population and the demand exist for it. As for machines, I think most gyms I&#039;ve been to have too many weight training machines and not enough racks, benches, and weights. The only machines that should be in a gym are treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes.

				Hi,<br /><br />I really would like a small women&#039;s clothing store that carried tailored suits and cocktail dresses in addition to casual wear.&nbsp; The idea of going out to one store and getting a beautiful dress, sandals, a bag to match, and a beautiful necklace would be ideal.&nbsp; Sort of like a one stop shopping boutique.&nbsp; <br /><br />The option of having several small and large sizes for those of us that are not size 8 or 10 would be appreciated as there aren&#039;t many stores that carry the larger sizes.<br /><br />Another great service to the women in the community would be the option to order whatever is on the floor in another size or color.<br /><br />Art work and photography could be displayed as part of the decor.<br /><br />To be continued . . .<br /><br />Best,&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d love to see a doggie day care - I miss the one we used to go to when we lived in Manhattan: Coco and Toto http://cocoandtoto.com/store/ (http://cocoandtoto.com/store/) It doesn&#039;t require much street frontage, but they have a little organic pet food, pet supply boutique up front, grooming, doggie day care, walking service, trainers, etc all operating out of a relatively small store (they do use their backyard in good weather for the dogs to exercise outdoors). <br /><br />Other places that do this (as a chain in Manhattan) are Biscuits and Bath http://www.biscuitsandbath.com/index.php (http://www.biscuitsandbath.com/index.php) and The Wagging Tail (they have a live video feed of their play area) http://thewaggingtail.com/services.html (http://thewaggingtail.com/services.html) <br /><br />

				As I attempted to do as much of my holiday shopping locally this year, it became really clear to me that we desperately need a bookstore in Jackson Heights. Actually, I would have loved to have had a good place to buy books, DVDs <span class="bbc_u">and</span> music CDs right here in the neighborhood. I know this has been discussed in other JHL threads before, but I just wanted to state it again. &nbsp;:)

				Jackson Heights has an amazing assortment of ethnic restaurants, but what it could really use is a place that serves what I call &quot;pub food&quot; - burgers, salads, pasta and a few entres.&nbsp; The kind of neighborhood place you could eat in several times a week and never tire of.&nbsp; Manhattan has many places like this.&nbsp; Good luck on whatever you choose to do!

You live next door to Woodside. Jackson heights could use a bar dedicated to music[rock] . You could draw from not only JH but Woodside and Sunnyside, LIC&nbsp; as well. Astoria has a few of these type places, but you have to take 2 trains to get there. <br /><br />Book store<br /><br />Music store..JH had 2 of the best in the past ..record room and Numbers &amp; tapes<br /><br />and a deli..Jewish , German&nbsp; whatever ..just a old fashioned&nbsp; type place..good cold cuts..good salads [potato, macaroni&nbsp; etc]&nbsp; I mean me and my friends travel to JH to get Chinese&nbsp; food [King Wah and JJ Garden] so people will travel <br /><br />anyways thats my 2 cents

				Thanks to all those who responded and gave good ideas, however I do not think there would be enough clientele to sustain such businesses like Jewish Deli, bookstore.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also the rents are through the roof at $4000 a month and up. For some reason the building owners think that because there is so much foot traffic people will be stopping in from morning till night, not so...If the price of goods is too low you will not be able to pay your cost and still make a profit. Then again if your cost is too high you still lose because know one can afford to pay. <br /><br />I am all about profit, but not to the point where I make people feel that they cannot afford anything, and leave feeling uncomfortable... Get this on 82ND St. a Verizon store is opening soon, when I inquired about the space the owner was asking for $8500 per month...So my brainstorming still continues.<br /><br />Thanks 77

				About two or three years ago my partner and myself were looking to open a French bistro in JH and found the same to be true. Rents totally too high to make a profit.&nbsp; While the demographic is changing, it wasn&#039;t enough to substantiate the financial investments. Believe it or not, we opened a place in the West Village. While our place is small, the rents were cheaper. What interested me is how some of the existing businesses continure to operate.

				The direction of this thread seems to suggest JH landlords limit the neighborhoodâ€™s potential by charging rents that primarily certain types of businesses, including chain stores like Starbucks and McDonaldâ€™s that already have money, can afford. Any business that doesnâ€™t serve the lowest common denominator in terms of services desired by the majority of residents and workers in the neighborhood seems doomed to failure. If landlords didnâ€™t charge such outlandish amounts for rent, small specialty businesses might be more likely to thrive, or open at all without closing in a year or two.<br /><br />I wonder if thereâ€™s a correlation between this and the fact that some of our most successful venues like Espresso 77 and Terraza 7 Train CafÃ© (actually in Elmhurst) are so tiny. And any business that is evidently successful presumably runs the risk of having its rent dramatically increased by a landlord who wants a bigger share of the businessâ€™s profit for no other reason other than being their landlord, and is willing to charge the venue into financial ruin to get it.
