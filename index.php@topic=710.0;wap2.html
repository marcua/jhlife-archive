			Is someone in the neighborhood is interesting in adopting a dog:&nbsp; don&#039;t know his real name but I call him Eddy, he&#039;s a beautiful young boxer maybe 2 years, very well manner.&nbsp; My dog can&#039;t get along with Eddy and I don&#039;t want to give him to ASPCA since he will be killed.<br />If interested please send me an email and we can arrange for you to see him

			The ASPCA is a no kill shelter that takes very good care of its animals.&nbsp; We just adopted a kitten two weeks ago and all the dogs there are well cared for.&nbsp;
