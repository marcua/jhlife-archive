			Just recently discovered this site.<br /><br />Lived in Jackson Heights from birth in 1941 until end of 1956, 86-10 34th Avenue, when we had to move after my father’s death. Watched as the tennis club disappeared plus the empty lots where lots of sports were played. In the end, schoolyards and streets were the playgrounds. Lots of good memories of fun and friends.<br /><br />Schools:<br />K-5: P.S. 149<br />6-8: Garden Country Day School - basketball plus a couple operettas<br />9-10: Trinity School in Manhattan<br /><br />Attended St. Mark’s for church and Cubs.<br /><br />Friends - I’m sure I’ll leave some out:<br /><br />Neighborhood friends: Billy Nussbaum, Lance Gaude, the Lyons brothers<br /><br />GCDS:<br />Male-Doug Floren, Tommy Thulin, Ray Liggio. <br />Female- Dee Layer, Val Curtin, Mary Anne M.<br /><br />Trinity- Went together with Doug Floren and Tommy Thulin from GCDS<br /><br />I was sad to leave JH, but, obviously, my life changed dramatically.
