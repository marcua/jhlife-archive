				I just happened upon this website http://www.ciarastore.com/main.sc<br /><br />The designer, who lives in Sunnyside, sells t-shirts and other products that have Queens themes.&nbsp; So far under the neighborhood category she only has Astoria, Long Island City and Sunnyside, but maybe she will add Jackson Heights if there&#039;s sufficient interest.<br /><br />Otherwise, there are plenty of Queens (non neigbhorhood specific) products.

				That seems to work fine. However, when I click the NEIGHBORHOOD STORE link from you main homepage, I&#039;m directed here: http://jhartstudio.com/store.jhartstudio.com which is a dead link and doesn&#039;t work.
