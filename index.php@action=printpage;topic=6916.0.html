				<strong>Jackson Heights Life Banner Contest #5- Winter 2012</strong><br /><br />It has been far too long since our last contest, so please join us for the Fifth Jackson Heights Life Banner Contest! We are looking for an excellent photograph or other original artwork to use on the banner of our website. &nbsp;Here are the rules for our contest:<br /><br />1. Three submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />2. Images should be in digital format, taken with at LEAST a 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality.<br />3. Photos should not portray identifiable individuals.<br />4. Submissions should have a horizonal composition to look good as a banner. &nbsp; <br />5. A small version of the image should be posted or linked to this thread with a brief title or description.<br />6. The contest starts immediately and will run until January 15, 2012. At that time the contest will be closed to new entries.<br />7. After the submission period is closed, the JHLife community will vote on the submitted images.<br />8. In February, a winner will be announced and the graphics will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />By your submission, you are giving us permission to use your image on the Jackson Heights Life homepage. &nbsp; <br /><br />If selected, your image will run for several months to a year. &nbsp;It should capture some aspect of Jackson Heights... images that capture a sense of the season are especially welcome. &nbsp;<br /><br />There is no need to crop photos before posting them for this contest. &nbsp;If your submission is selected, we will work with you to turn it into an appropriate banner. &nbsp;The final banner size is usually 998 pixels wide, and 110-150 pixels tall. &nbsp; We will put your name, username or email on the banner so people can contact you.<br /><br />FYI, there are two ways to post images on this site. &nbsp;The first way is to upload them to another site, like Flickr or Photobucket, and link to the image from here. &nbsp;An explanation of how to do this is over here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=374.msg1700#msg1700).<br /><br />The second way is to attach a file directly to your post. &nbsp;At the bottom of the page, click on &quot;Additional Options,&quot; and then enter the filename in the box next to &quot;Attach:&quot;. &nbsp;Files must be smaller than 128 kB.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><em>signed,<br />Moderators shelby2 and chuckster<br />and Calendar Editor toddg</em><br /><br />P.S. Thanks to CrabbyPatty for the excellent collage we have been using for the past several months.<br /><br />P.P.S. For a trip down memory lane, here are the past winners:<br /><br />Photo Contest #1 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=550.0):<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2186/2418653711_77d9d2c2b3_o.jpg)<br /><br />Photo Contest #2 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1678.0):<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/3577078347_722b638d96_o.jpg)<br /><br />Photo Contest #3 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2829.0):<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3714529431_870032a826_o.jpg)<br /><br />Photo Contest #4 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4495.0):<br />(http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4063/4626206918_98a2bc957a_z.jpg)

				Just a reminder -- we are looking for new art/photography for the Jackson Heights Life banner!&nbsp; This thread has been sleeping on the second page for a while, so I&#039;m extending the deadline to <strong>January 22nd</strong> just in case people haven&#039;t seen it.&nbsp; Please consider whether you have any Jackson Heights photos you&#039;d like to submit&nbsp; -- or nominating one of the banners from a previous contest.&nbsp; I like the &quot;Doors of JH&quot; banner a lot, but it&#039;s time for a change!

				Two photos are attached as submissions for the banner. <br />They are uncropped, (though I have definite thoughts on how to crop them).
