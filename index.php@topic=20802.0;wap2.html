			We are about to lose our health insurance and are looking into ACA.<br />I&#039;ve looked at the NY ACA site. There is a lot of info but it is a bit confusing.<br />Are there any consultants in the JH area who know the system well that i could talk to?<br />Many thanks, David

			I haven&#039;t used this service, but New York State publishes a list of &quot;Navigator&quot; agencies that help people sign up for health insurance.&nbsp; You can find a list here: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/ipanavigatorsitelocations <br /><br />Good luck!

			We went through this years ago. My best advice is to find out which insurances your doctors accept and look into the companys&#039; prescription formularies to see which companies meet your needs. To make an informed decision you&#039;ll have to figure out how much you&#039;ll have to pay out of pocket in addition to the monthly fees.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s better to have a larger deductible if your annual cost goes down because your maximum out of pocket is reached sooner. Take your time and figure out what&#039;s best for your family&#039;s health and peace of mind.
