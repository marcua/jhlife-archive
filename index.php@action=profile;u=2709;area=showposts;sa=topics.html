					A friend of mine was coming home late yesterday, around 2am, and stopped to get a falafel from the cart on 37th Ave near 80 or 81 Street.&nbsp; The guy asked if she had a boyfriend and started making vulgar hand gestures asking if he &quot;sexed her real good&quot; then grabbing and touching himself through his clothes.&nbsp; She&#039;d already paid so she simply left and hurried home.&nbsp; She said she was in such shock she wasn&#039;t sure what to do and if it was something worth reporting to the cops<br /><br />Just thought I&#039;d put it out here for awareness and see if anyone else has had an obscene encounter with that particular cart. Also, does anyone have suggestions for anything she could still do now even though its a day later? Is there someone we could ask who could encourage an investigation of this particular vendor or something?

					My mother is coming to visit in April!!!&nbsp; She&#039;s a polio survivor and has trouble walking long distances and stairs.&nbsp; This is my 4th apartment and I have an elevator now so she&#039;s finally able to come visit my home... I&#039;m crazy excited - after all these years she&#039;ll see that I do actually clean my room and vacuum without having to be threatened with being grounded first :2funny:<br /><br />She&#039;s been to NYC before so she doesn&#039;t need to do a lot of sightseeing and will mostly be visiting with friends and family but we will want to go out some.&nbsp; Does anyone have suggestions for wheelchair rentals? And anything besides taxis and zipcar (both of which I&#039;ll be using) to ease getting around?&nbsp; she CAN walk its just with a couple canes, and since she&#039;s such a trooper she keeps going long after she should.... a scenario I want to avoid.<br /><br />Ideas for things to do would be appreciated too..<br />We are thinking dinner cruise around Manhattan (she loves boats and water) - anyone have any suggestions regarding those just in general?<br />She wants to see Ellis Island... I know a limited number of wheelchairs are available but I&#039;d rather not be at the mercy of first-come-first-served&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br />

					So, some friends of mine that want to move here found an apartment they are really interested in but they found a complaint online stating that the whole building was infested with bedbugs... 311 has closed out the complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone here know if 7410 35th Ave indeed did have bedbugs and if they are completely gone now?&nbsp; Any other inside scoop on the building would be really appreciated as well

					So I&#039;m seriously in love with my new apartment and Jackson Heights and have been actively recruiting all my friends to come join me in paradise.... and I actually convinced someone!&nbsp; <br /><br />Now we just need to find a place.&nbsp; They want a top floor (light sleepers and had a miserable experience when a partying DJ moved in above them and have swore off ever living below anyone again).&nbsp; &nbsp;Its a couple and one well behaved cat. Would prefer to avoid a broker fee if at all possible.&nbsp; Up to around $1,700 depending on the unit but would prefer to stay in the 1,300 - 1,600 range.&nbsp; Move by March 1st<br /><br />any tips?<br />&nbsp;

					I just moved into the Hampshire House last week and can&#039;t figure out why this thing is in my wall. I&#039;ve asked an electrician, google, the real estate agent (unfortunately the seller left the country and is hard to reach and he also had tenants after he moved out so he&#039;s not a sure answer anyway) as well as all my facebook friends and no one has a clue as to what this is for.<br /><br />Bad cellphone photo: <img src="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a2/ABedelia3/circuit.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Its a circuit board, hardwired directly into the electrical system.&nbsp; My friend uninstalled it and nothing adverse has happened... yet.&nbsp; The facebook consensus was that it was a government or organized crime listening device (albeit a rather conspicuously placed one&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" />). The one serial number I could get off one of the things on the board brought up timers on google.<br /><br />Someone went to some trouble to install it, make a plate cover and etc. for it so I&#039;d hate to toss it if it has some practical purpose... I just can&#039;t figure what purpose that might be.&nbsp; Misc details that are probably unrelated but since it was on my electrical system... I think this building was built late &#039;30s, I have no phone jack in the place, no electrical outlets in the bathroom but I have 7 circuit breakers for a 1 bedroom and while this was installed in the entryway it happened to be on the same breaker as my refrigerator.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone here have an answer or theories?<br />

					I just moved in and need a locksmith. Anyone have any recommendations and a guesstimate for prices?<br /><br />The set of keys I got from the seller is lacking a key to the deadbolt... But he did include a random key to nowhere to make up for the missing key.&nbsp; And the door knob is on wrong so I have the potential to get locked into my apartment... Which would be an interesting reason to call out of work I suppose :-)<br /><br />So, a cylinder change, reconfigure the knob and perhaps change that lock too. Any ideas what that will run me?<br /><br />Thanks!
