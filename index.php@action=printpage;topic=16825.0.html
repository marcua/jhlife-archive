				<strong>850 SQ FT 1-BEDROOM WITH OFFICE/GUEST ROOM (JUNIOR 4) in Hampton Court (78th St and 35th Ave) @ $475,000. To schedule an appoint for viewing the apartment call the owner&#039;s number (917-545-6416). </strong><br /><br /><strong>Details on Zillow: </strong>https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/house,condo,apartment_duplex,mobile,townhouse_type/124151123_zpid/1-_beds/0-600000_price/0-2209_mp/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.807767,-73.795681,40.69411,-73.980217_rect/12_zm/?view=public<br /><br />Hampton Court is in the heart of the Jackson Heights Historic District, and is one of the most coveted pre-war cooperative buildings. This traditional four-room layout (one formal bedroom) has been artfully updated to have a second bedroom or office with pocket French doors, leaving ample dining and living space. Classic details abound with 9+ foot ceilings, original oak floors, hallway arches, transom windows, and picture rails. The apartment was recently renovated with new lighting, bathroom tiles and fixtures, and an updated kitchen with white granite countertops and stainless steel appliances (including an energy efficient Blomberg refrigerator). The apartment boasts plenty of storage with four full-height closets with built-ins.<br /><br />The building has a newly installed laundry room (cost of use is part of monthly maintenance), and the apartment comes with a spacious floor-to-ceiling storage bin in the basement, at no additional charge. The maintenance is $684 per month. A 25% down payment is required at purchase and there is a 1% flip tax at sale. Cats are allowed, but dogs are not.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has a vibrant culture, with great food and an active civic life. Open on Sundays, the excellent Jackson Heights Green Market is just down the block. The apartment is close to transportation, including the 7/E/F/M/R trains from Broadway/74th Street.<br />

				Hi yotake! Just as a head&#039;s up, I sent you a private message. You don&#039;t have to respond, of course, I just wanted to make sure you knew it was there.<br />Thanks!
