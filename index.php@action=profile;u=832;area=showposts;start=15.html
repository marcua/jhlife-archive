Blackjack loves it! Like Abee&#039;s dog, he came home exhausted from his interview day. We also checked in on him several times via webcam (Yes, it is addictive!) and he was having a ball. We brought him back for their grand opening party and he had a blast again. (His team won the &quot;dunking for hot dogs&quot; contest.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /> ) He&#039;s going to be staying over with them this Saturday night. When you consider that the $50 overnight rate includes two days of &quot;doggie daycare&quot; (pick up by 6:00 PM on Sunday), it&#039;s really quite reasonable.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Please read my response to Tigoillo!</em>

I&#039;ve forgotten lots of these places.---bred in Jackson Heights ---over 30 years total.<br />Let&#039;s see some that may have been missed.<br /><br /><strong>Green Theme Florist</strong> on the corner of 75th and 37th ..northside...very dubious place...all sorts of plants and &quot;herbage&quot; could be purchased there. I was too young..just rumours <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><strong>Raja&#039;s </strong>candystore which was located where the city cafe is now..across the street from PS69. Old guy who was really grumpy and wore an old white smock would sell all the&nbsp; baseball card, fake bubblegum cigarettes, handballs, bazooka gum and milkshakes you ever wanted ...(may be that the furniture in City is part of the original Rajas...looks familiar).<br /><br /><strong>Ferns!! </strong>on 74th street!! good call on that one...BUT do you remember that beautiful black wooden saddled..and when I say saddle I mean I think it was a real saddle-- coin operated horse?<br /><br />Don&#039;s on the corner of 80th street and 37th avenue ...where the bodega is now.&nbsp; Candystore soda shop with video games at the rear!<br /><br /><strong>The Pit!</strong> the arcade in the lower levels of the 74th street station. Great stamp collectors shop across the hall and that sketchy bar right by the bus terminal on the 74th and Roosevelt.---had to pass the bar to get to the stairs leading to the arcade.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Discount Bookstore</strong><br />Tons of old comic books, and I remember when they first opened they had 1000&#039;s of promotional movie photo BW stills..25 cents each.<br /><br /><strong>Barrs </strong>across the street from the Post office...a toystore and gift shop. Had great boardgames in the back!<br /><br /><strong>Numbers Records and Tapes</strong> (and 8 tracks...dad bought Saturday Night Fever there)...used to be on the corner where Ingrids is now on 78th street.<br /><br />Of course the Colony...snuck into my first rated R movie there.&nbsp; Conan the Barbarian....starring Gov,. Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />There used to be a store joined to ShopWise on the 76th street side. I think it was a toy store of sorts but my memories about that place date me to about 3 years old so a little foggy.<br /><br />There was&nbsp; a great Chinese restaurant where that Atlantis 2000 club is now. It was Chino Latino..as they all spoke Spanish and my 1st Communion party was hosted in the rear social room!<br /><br />Speaking of social clubs...right there on 37th road and 77th street..a real sketchy social club that was eventually closed by the police..big raid and all.<br /><br />Concha D&#039;Oro was the name of the pizza place next to the&nbsp; Eagle ..and I swear they had the Best slice I have had to this day. I really miss that pizza. Was not very busy.<br /><br />Guilllietas Pizza was the name of the present Thomas&#039; on 77th. Slice for 5o cents sicilian 55.<br /><br />If I remember anything else....<br /><br /><br />HEY if anyone has any photographs of these shopfronts please let me know. I just posted something about Toy City which is cited somewhere here im sure. I&#039;m working on a little Jackson Heights memories project.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Oh my God; it&#039;s all coming back to me!&nbsp; That was no rumor about the Green Theme; they *did* sell interesting things, in there!&nbsp; And I only originally remembered buying plants in there!&nbsp; You have jogged my memory!!</em>

I&#039;m a newcomer; I moved here six years ago from California when my wife and I were expecting our first child.&nbsp; We chose JH because it was diverse, vibrant, child-friendly, and affordable (we chose well -- we have no regrets, and are planning to stay here for the long term!).&nbsp; Other neighborhoods comparable in price like Forest Hills and various neighborhoods in Brooklyn were less interesting to us because they lacked the diversity that JH had to offer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard similar stories from many of the other newcomers I&#039;ve encountered.<br /><br />And you might be surprised by a visit to 74th Street!&nbsp; Erase from your mind any image of a ghetto of poor immigrants.&nbsp; This is the top South Asian shopping district in the U.S. -- store after store of fine jewelery and expensive saris, catering to Indian brides from all over the U.S. stopping in N.Y. to shop before returning home to India for their weddings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Neighborhoods in NYC need constant change, or they become stale.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has seen many waves of immigrants... over the years, these have included many different ethnic groups.&nbsp; Our latest wave is an influx of Mexicans, Tibetans and Nepalis.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians, Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Koreans before them, they&#039;re adding to our neighborhood&#039;s tapestry, and many of us welcome them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Hi, ToddG,<br /><br />In the early 1980s, I lived in the building in which I grew up, for a year, in a neighborhood that had become innundated with an Asian population, that clearly despised non-Asian culture and people.&nbsp; I lived there for a *year*, and for a year, I greeted my neighbors, every day, with a smile, and an appropriate greeting.&nbsp; When I left, after a *year*, I was still smiling and saying &quot;hello&quot;,and still *no one was returning the greeting*!&nbsp; Those people looked through me as if I weren&#039;t even there.&nbsp; They behaved as if I were an unwelcome intruder in *their* neighborhood.&nbsp; It was *not* &quot;coming home&quot;, as I had expected it to be.<br />As we are expressing personal opinions, and memories and impressions of the neighborhood in which we all grew up, I take the liberty of saying that it is disheartening for me to hear the only place I ever considered &quot;home&quot; being described as the &quot;top south Asian shopping district in the U.S.&quot;!&nbsp; And that, as such, your comment only magnifies the impression I get that Jackson Heights only remains in name - - and that the entire purpose and flavor of that neighborhood has been entirely destroyed.&nbsp; No longer is it a world away from the city; a safe, peaceful haven, away from the madding crowd.<br />Might I also point out to you that there is no such thing as &quot;*fine* Indian Jewelry&quot;, and that rows and rows of saree shops don&#039;t exactly transform J.H. into Beverly Hills.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t please me that Indian brides from all over the U.S. crowd into Jackson Heights and clog the neighborhood with that kind of traffic.&nbsp; What you are describing is *commercial*, and does not belong in a neighborhood, where people raise their families.&nbsp; The congestion of Manhattan is not what former residents of that neighborhood were aiming for.&nbsp; I have looked at the traffic reports for J.H., and seen that there was, a few years ago, an attempt to change a certain traffic routing, that was deemed to be *too much* for that neighborhood to accomodate.&nbsp; That was a very good indication of how much things have changed there.&nbsp; <br />The country has changed, and neighborhoods have changed with it - - for the worse!&nbsp; Oh, wouldn&#039;t you have loved to have been able to leave your back door unlocked, as we did, so that your children could run in and out, as they played, unguarded and without threat, in that neighborhood?&nbsp; Once - - it was heaven.&nbsp; I cannot help but mourn the loss of that.&nbsp; <br />One error that you make is in your combinations of immigrants, that you cite.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t as you say, you see.&nbsp; The Irish, Germans, Greeks, Italians, and Jews, who lived in J.H., all lived there at the same time.&nbsp; This was *European* culture - - and it was *compatible*.&nbsp; There *were* NO Puerto Ricans in Jackson Heights - - this was part of Manhattan&#039;s culture; not ours.&nbsp; &#039;West Side Story&#039; wasn&#039;t happening in our neighborhood - - unless it was playing at the Jackson.&nbsp; And Hispanic immigrants who came were from Cuba, Spain, and Columbia, and were entirely embracing of European culture; they were not distaff to the existing culture.&nbsp; And the neighborhood did not change to accomodate them.&nbsp; As you can see, from the descriptions of the stores and shops of yesteryear, Jackson Heights had its own culture, and when you came to live there, you became part of that neighborhood - - it didn&#039;t change to accomodate you.<br />I now live in a neighborhood where you have to have a car, and drive for miles, on shopping *expeditions*, to be able to access food and products you might want - - unless you are black, Hispanic or south Asian.&nbsp; Is that a *comfortable* neighborhood for me to live in?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (And *where* is the comfortable, convenient neighborhood for me to live in, that I can afford???)&nbsp; Again I will repeat, that were I to visit India, and discover that an entire neighborhood had been taken over by former residents of Jackson Heights, and made to entirely resemble that neighborhood, I would say - - &quot;What a shame!&quot;.<br />P.S.&nbsp; Nothing &quot;stale&quot; about a place that is reliably the sort of neighborhood that I knew J.H. to be!</em>

Also sold discount shampoo/cosmetics before the CVS&#039;s and Walgreen&#039;s of this world.<br /><br /><strong>Northern Lanes</strong> on 75th Street of Northern, (bowling lanes were bumpy) Now part of the car dealer.<br /><br />There were industries on the west side of the Heights near the Connecting Railroad. Place that did plating, a surgical instrument maker and a printer. White Castle District Office still remains.<br /><br />You could actually play with ALL your schoolmates in PS69&#039;s and IS 145&#039;s school yards<br /><br />Cafe 77 was a real Chinese Laundry, took many of my Grandfathers shirts there (and each regular customer had a mark)<br /><br />The <strong>Jackson Heights Library</strong> actually had BOOKS in it. Rows and rows of books. Didn&#039;t have to wait for inter-branch loans to come in.<br /><br />Brown&#039;s Army and Navy Stores still survive!<br /><br />Grandmother used to make the trek to <strong>Pick-n-Pack</strong> down on 37th and 85th(?) for discount meat and then complain about all the red food dye they used. <br /><br />The Big Delicatessen on Roosevelt between 82nd and 83rd, (German Potato Salad).<br /><br />The movie theater on Northern had big holes in the roof but would let you in to see the &quot;R&quot; rated movies.<br /><br /><strong>The Roman Cave </strong>was the place to go for Italian Food and treated little kids like kings!<br /><br /><strong>The Old Barn</strong> on Roosevelt and 80th(/) served family sized meals. You could buy your furniture at <strong>Jackson Furniture</strong> across the street.<br /><br />The <strong>Garden School</strong> had guard dogs in their yard. They were the type that would let you in, but then you could not leave. (Great &quot;kid&quot; fun petting the guard dog then having your buddy distract the dog so you could get your hand out of the fence holes) The car dealers had dogs too.<br /><br />You can now add the Q19B to the list of things &quot;gone&quot; at least in name.<br /><br />There was no 115 Pct. You had to deal with the 114 Pct. or 110 Pct. and wait FOREVER for a patrol car. Heaven help the person who had an auto accident on Northern. They might still be waiting&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /> <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Went to Garden School for primary grades, before they had guard dogs (but yes; I remember, years later, them installing them).&nbsp; At that time, the entire block was green and suburban-looking - - they didn&#039;t call it &quot;Garden&quot; for no reason!&nbsp; There was a springtime carnival on the front lawn, before there was any fencing, there (or the dogs, that came even later).&nbsp; I remember the school cafeteria had murals on all the walls, scenes from Alice In Wonderland.&nbsp; Jackson Heights was very lovely then.</em>
