				Curious if anyone out there knows anything about what&#039;s happening with the Polk Theater on 93rd St. and 37th ave. <br /><br />I know it was built in the late 30&#039;s, and served the neighborhood for quite a long time as a regular movie theater. At some point it transitioned over to Adult Films and sank in to ill-repute and disrepair (as many porn theaters do). Somewhere in Mid 2006, the building was bought by developers and has since been closed to the public (perhaps for the better)<br /><br />A series of stores adjacent to The Polk have also been closed for a significant amount of time.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems as if the developers are planning on waiting out all the remaining commercial tenants and may proceed with demolishing the property entirely.<br /><br />I ventured in to the Polk once while it was still open and discovered that under the layers of grime and smut there was a beautiful old 30s style theater with a large auditorium. It seems to me that Jackson Heights could benefit from a visible arts space that supports local arts groups and community functions. <br /><br />Much like the Eagle (or Earle) theatre was transformed in to a unique Bollywood Gem for the neighborhood, wouldn&#039;t it be great to have another space that brings the arts and culture closer to our community? <br /><br />Anyway, I was jsut curious to see if any one out there knew anything about what&#039;s happening on that block ? <br /><br />-<br /><br />Andrew&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I checked on the Department of Buildings database to see if I could figure out what&#039;s going to be built here.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I know how to interpret the documents, but they seem to indicate this will be a 6-story building, with ground floor retail, medical offices on the second floor, and four floors of residences (with a total of 32 units).&nbsp; It will also include a two-level underground parking garage with space for 83 cars.&nbsp; The initial application was rejected, but only because the filing fee was for an improper amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not find any pictures of what this building will look like.

				<br /><em>I found this article on the jhfamilies site and thought it was relevant here.</em><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Groups meet on landmarking celebrated Queens sites</strong><br />By David Freedlander<br />dfreedlander@am-ny.com<br /><br />It&#039;s too late for the 19th-century parsonage at St. Saviour&#039;s Episcopal Church â€” it was leveled in December â€”&nbsp; and Long Island City&#039;s Hackett Building, a structure built in 1884, was torn down last year for condos. Before any more of Queens&#039; history disappears, a group of activists and preservationists is organizing to save what&#039;s left. The Queens Civic Congress, an umbrella organization of more than 100 civic groups, will host a workshop at 7:30 tonight at TheShops at Atlas Park in Glendale to build interest in landmarking in a borough where protected sites number less than 20 percent of Manhattan&#039;s. &quot;We need to get the landmarks commission to pay the same attention to Queens that they pay elsewhere,&quot; said Corey Bearak, president of the organization. &quot;We have a history that goes way back, and we have places that merit protection before the wrecking ball comes.&quot;<br />

				Looks like the proposed building is still having trouble getting approved...<br /><br />Times Ledger<br />&nbsp;Jax Heights&#039; Polk Theatre razed (http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19429698&amp;BRD=2676&amp;PAG=461)<br />By Jeremy Walsh<br />03/27/2008<br /><br />A vintage movie theater dating back to the Great Depression has been torn down in Jackson Heights and the plans for a new mixed-used building to fill the vacant lot are in limbo.<br /><br />The Polk Theatre, located at the corner of 93rd Street and 37th Avenue, had become an adult theater before closing in 2006.<br /><br />The building was demolished sometime in February. Property owner Henry Zheng now hopes to construct a six-story, mixed-use building on the site, but his plans have been challenged by the city.<br /><br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete story)</em><br /><br />

				I actually looked in to what it would take to landmark that theatre after I learned that it had been sold. The problem there is you need owner consent to landmark a building. I don&#039;t think the developers would have agreed to that as it would have gotten in the way of their plans. <br /><br />Even if The Polk was landmarked it would then have to be repaired, and it this day and age I imagine would have takena several million dollar capital campaign to restore it to a safe and useable condition. <br /><br />Oh well... let&#039;s hop we don&#039;t lose the Eagle theatre to developers anytime soon.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
