					It is really too bad that this forum is dominated by people who either are disgruntled for whatever reason or just don&#039;t like the majority of the community here because they aren&#039;t white and posh. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I did anything wrong at all in addressing racist and classist comments, especially knowing that the writers of these comments live here in JH. It gets annoying to read after all while, but apparently the majority of those who have posted on this thread don&#039;t see it the same way. In any case, I do apologize for the use of profanity and my tone turning harsher, but I certainly don&#039;t apologize for calling out the comments I did. <br /><br />

It&#039;s unreasonable to say someone can&#039;t want their favorite kind of restaurant to open nearby their home.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t there a store or cuisine that you wished would come to Jackson Heights?

Thanks for your comment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />I too think it&#039;s unreasonable to not have every effing thing one wants in life within 5 steps of walking distance! What the hell, where is the justice in that! If I want Senegalese, why the fuck isn&#039;t that restaurant parked right on my curbside?<br /><br />There IS a Greek restaurant right in our neighborhood, so if you didn&#039;t notice that, I pointed that out, and you feel attacked, then the fault is on you as you&#039;re stupid and you didn&#039;t use the Internet which you obviously have access to. Where in the fuck is that MY fault?<br /><br />At the end: GTFO. Seriously. You people that are bitching about JH&#039;s residents who are not white or European enough for you, there are other places that offer that, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALREADY OFFERED HERE IN JH OR WITHIN/LESS THAN ONE MILE RADIUS.

You want a freaking burger, not that hard to find. &quot;New American&quot; is an effing joke because what that is is taking &quot;international cuisine&quot; and making it palatable for non local eaters. Why not just eat the actual &quot;international cuisine&quot; itself? Everything that people have whined about on this thread is found within a mile radius of the JH Roosevelt train station, I know this because I have frequented all these places. I simply cannot believe anyone that says they cannot find what they want. <br /><br /><br />PS. Middle Eastern and South Asian are not the same thing. <br /><br /><br />

					--dssjh, thank you for your replies. I didn&#039;t mention your other ones\ because I was trying to focus on the egregious ones. But I&nbsp; do certainly appreciate your input, and I agree with you. This is what I mean--a very, very vocal minority is giving a very skewed idea. The majority of JH residents somehow don&#039;t seem to count. <br /><br />I was also going to post about a cute bookstore, it doesn&#039;t have to be alternative or anything, just would be nice to have books, until I was impelled to address the racism on this forum. <br /><br /><br />--Dkaplan, OMG, WUT A CUTE GIF! OMG, ISN&#039;T RACISM CUTE!<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you think it&#039;s funny! And I think you&#039;re funny too! Do you have any thoughts on this, though?<br /><br />

Or there is always Staten Island. Just steer clear of the nonwhite immigrant communities there. <br /><br />On a serious note, I am genuinely curious as to why those who dislike JH and find other neighborhoods attractive remain here. JH native? Failed to make it in the neighborhood of your choice? Like the affordable property prices affordable, but now that you&#039;re here, you don&#039;t like the very people whose presence kind of made it affordable for you in the first place? I really want to know.

I remember those anti Muslim comments and if I remember correctly, only one person spoke up. I am sorry, but if one writes certain things, I would hope others counteract that. What&#039;s this nonsense of people having a free pass for talking gibberish against any kind of people?
