				That video is very disturbing.&nbsp; But let’s take sexual orientation out of it.&nbsp; We should be a bit more concerned it was gang style beating.&nbsp; What’s goin on here?

				Place is near to me so I&#039;ve gone here in the past.&nbsp; Never again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read some of the comments made by employees.&nbsp; These guys didn&#039;t start anything - and to have management tell then to eat and leave is insulting.&nbsp; Screw this place.

				&quot;Franco said she reviewed surveillance video of the fight that indicates the couple started the fight, contrary to what activists claimed at their press conference outside the restaurant.&quot;<br />So what <strong>actually</strong> happened?&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to tell what truth is these days.
