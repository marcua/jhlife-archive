			Has anyone tried the Jackson Heights flavor &quot;Mangodesh&quot; made by 5 boroughs? http://www.5boroughsicecream.com/flavors.html<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but find it odd that the ice cream is unavailable (as pints anyway) in this neighborhood especially when we have a flavor named after us!&nbsp; The website lists several stores in Manhattan and a couple in Astoria but nothing here. I was thinking of getting it for a dinner at my home but it seems I will have to go out of my way to acquire it.&nbsp; I had heard at some point that Espresso 77 carries it or planned to carry it but I&#039;m not sure that helps me unless they sell pints.<br /><br />

			Espresso 77 does sell pints, but every time I&#039;ve asked they&#039;ve been sold out of that flavor.&nbsp; Instead, I&#039;ve tried the South Bronx Cha Cha Chocolate, which is amazing.&nbsp; But be warned: it is not mildly spicy, it is very spicy!
