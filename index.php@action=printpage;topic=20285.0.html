				How is the&nbsp; quality of inpatient care at Elmhurst Hospital?&nbsp; I know at one-time the&nbsp; ER trauma services were very good.&nbsp; Do they have good coronary and cancer care?&nbsp; I know the city hospitals tend to get overwhelmed by the uninsured but I was curious to know if the hospital had quality inpatient&nbsp; care.&nbsp; About a week ago&nbsp; a friend of mine thought he was having a heart attack and he insisted on being taken to a Manhattan hospital because he didn&#039;t think he would get the same level of care at Elmhurst Hospital.

				I don&#039;t know about Elmhurst, but I was hospitalized at Flushing Hospital, Main Street back in February and received very caring and professional treatments. Thank my lucky star my freak accident occurred before the Covid outbreak, otherwise I couldn&#039;t imagine how long the ER wait were going to be.

				Several years ago my husband was taken by ambulance to Elmhurst Hospital, to be checked for possible heart attack. I am not usually a germaphobe type, but I was horrified by the dirtiness of the ER there, to the extent that I wouldn&#039;t sit in one of their seats. The intake process was also alarming--at first we could not get anyone&#039;s attention. I got on the phone with one of my husband&#039;s outpatient doctors and told him I was unhappy with Elmhurst and could we leave and go someplace else? He said no, if it&#039;s suspicion of heart attack you have to stay put. I was also a bit freaked out by the visible fact that this is a hospital used for prisoners. It was kind of upsetting to see patients chained to beds. At one point, I helped my husband go to the bathroom, and when we came out we found a shackled prisoner escorted by a policeman waiting to get in. At a time when I was already upset and scared--honestly, to see this sort of thing I found added to my distress. However--and this is a big however--once my husband was in a room and being cared for by doctors, he was happy and pleasantly impressed with his care. Later, we were told by several people that Elmhurst is a designated trauma center, and since it&#039;s only a few blocks from our apartment, in an emergency we definitely should go there. (This was before our present healthcare situation, of course, which has made going to any healthcare setting a bit fraught.) And happily, my husband had not had a heart attack, but they wanted to be sure and kept him overnight. All in all, it&#039;s not a pretty place, but the word is that it&#039;s a good hospital staffed by very good doctors.

				&nbsp;Thanks for asking this question and the current answers, ljr. I wondered the same thing since we once clocked an emergency drive to Elmhurst at 4 minutes in the middle of the night. The dirtiness is off putting and the prisoners too. We were told not to sit near certain people who had bedbugs by security. But the medical care was very good in my estimation and the same or better as some Manhattan hospitals. We know of a sad circumstance where a death may have occurred because of snobbery at the conditions at Elmhurst. This makes me think twice now before going on a trek to another hospital, if time is of the essence.

				Yes, we had a subsequent occasion to go to an ER, and I asked the doctor we had called if in this case it would be okay to go into Manhattan instead of to Elmhurst. We ideally wanted to go to the hospital most of our doctors are affiliated with, Weill Cornell. In that case it was okay to go further (different health issue). No ER is in any degree pleasant, but the issues that bothered us at Elmhurst did not exist at Weill Cornell.

				In August of 2018 my husband had a major heart attack and was taken by ambulance to Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; I was so concerned about the level of care he would get there; however, they saved his life. He went directly into the ER and was in a great deal of pain. The only issue we had was that we had to wait for the cardiac surgeon, who did the procedure to clear the clot and put in a stent, as he was not on the premises and had to be called.&nbsp; One would think that there should be a cardiac surgeon in the hospital ER for all shifts.&nbsp; We had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes for him to arrive, and with a &quot;widow-maker&quot; heart attack, time is of the essence. However, that was our only issue.&nbsp; My husband was treated as soon as the surgeon arrived and spent 4 days in the CICU, where again, we had no complaints about his care. My husband is a doctor himself, so he can be a bit critical when it comes to medical care and he has high expectations. Under the circumstances and considering that Elmhurst I believe is considered a trauma center, it was the right place to go when time was of the essence, especially since were were about five blocks away. However, we were not particularly happy with the after care provided by the cardiac clinic and he has since switched to a cardiologist in Manhattan.&nbsp; We are very grateful for the life saving care he received at Elmhurst Hospital though, and he would return there if another emergency of this type took place. Hopefully we won&#039;t have to do this again, especially now in the time of COVID.
