				I am in market for a JH apartment and was curious to see how locals comment on which side of buildings to live on. Garden side provides quiet atmosphere and green view that can&#039;t be beat but I am more concerned with the amount of light go into apartment. BTW I specifically look into the Berkeley.&nbsp; TIA

				I&#039;m not positive, but I believe many apartments in Jackson Heights have both street and garden views with one side getting more light in the morning and the other side in the afternoon.&nbsp;

				If light is paramount, choose a higher floor.

				It&#039;s a toss-up. Something about the way these blocks were designed make them perfect echo chambers. I&#039;m amazed, not bothered, by how clearly i hear foot traffic and conversation from my sixth-floor, front-facing apartment. I am closer to 37th ave though. <br /><br />Also don&#039;t assume a window facing the back is guaranteed serenity. Parents, especially on the board, have a tendency to try to turn backyards into personal playgrounds for their children. <br /><br />If you want great lighting, pick a higher apartment, eastern exposure, especially facing a building with only 5 floors.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Indeed, many have both. Most Towers apartments have the living room/dining room facing the street while the bedrooms are in the garden, in the back of the apartment.

				In the Belvedere facing 35th Street, apts have one or the other.&nbsp; We have 2-1/2 exposures but to two streets.&nbsp; Others look toward garden. Check out our friend&#039;s apt for both street and garden views and LOTS of light.<br /><br />https://corenyc.com/property/37-28-85th-st-2-3230042/

				OP, you&#039;ll also want to consider southern exposure versus northern exposure. Most of my windows have a northern exposure, which leads to little direct light about 7 months out of the year. The only direct light I get consistently all year comes for 20 minutes each day, at an angle that shows every bit of dust and cat hair. <br /><br />I rented an apartment on 37th Ave years ago facing the little courtyard. It was certainly quieter than the apartments facing 37th Avenue, but I also missed being able to look at and gauge the weather and what to wear from pedestrians.
