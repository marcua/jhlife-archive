				An extremely important policy and planning issue may soon be coming to our community...<br /><br /><strong>Queens leaders hope to bring some livability back to Queens&#039; &#039;gold coast&#039; with new affordable housing push (http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-leaders-hope-bring-affordability-back-queens-gold-coast-article-1.1893228)</strong><br /><br />Community Board 2 chair Joseph Conley is proposing a plan to create four small zones within the district where developers will be allowed to build denser and higher if they create below market housing. Mayor de Blasio has said that potentially allowing larger buildings is an important component of his ambitious plan for 200,000 affordable apartments in the city.<br /><br />BY ELI ROSENBERG&nbsp; NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, August 5, 2014, 9:36 PM<br /><br />Hey Mr. Mayor! Build it here!<br /><br />Leaders in Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside are inviting the city to look their way to put up some of the 200,000 affordable apartments the de Blasio administration has promised to create or preserve.<br /><br />“The neighborhood has become too pricey,&quot; said Community Board 2 chair Joseph Conley. “In Hunters Point and Long Island City, the rents are astronomical and people are being priced out.”<br /><br />Conley penned a letter to city officials proposing four swaths of land that could be rezoned to allow for taller buildings and potentially denser developments with affordable housing set aside.<br /><br />They include part of Queens Plaza in Long Island City, a triangle in Woodside — bound by Broadway, Northern Blvd. and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway — and an area in Sunnyside near Northern Blvd. between 43rd to 48th Sts.<br /><br />Conley also proposed building on top of the Long Island Rail Road tracks on Woodside Ave. between 63rd and 65th Sts.<br /><br />Developers taking advantage of the new zoning would have to make at least 30% of their buildings’ units affordable, Conley said.<br /><br />“No requirement for affordable housing will have our district continue to gentrify unchecked,” he wrote to Department of City Planning Commissioner Carl Weisbrod, referring to Long Island City as a &quot;new Queens &#039;Gold Coast.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />Rents continue to climb in much of the district.<br /><br />In Long Island City, one-bedroom apartments can rent for between $2,800 and $3,200 a month.<br /><br />Two-bedrooms go up to $4,000 a month, according to real estate expert Rick Rosa, the executive vice president of Douglas Elliman&#039;s outpost in the neighborhood.<br /><br />“New York has become so unaffordable that it’s hard for people to live in good neighborhoods,” Rosa said.<br /><br />Rents in Sunnyside are generally more affordable due to the area’s concentration of rent-stabilized units, according to broker Harvey Heit, who noted a one-bedroom averages between $1,500 and $1,700.<br /><br />Officials were receptive to the proposal.<br /><br />“We appreciate [the community board’s] willingness to discuss the important goals of expanding housing that will be affordable to a range of incomes,” a Department of City Planning spokeswoman said.<br /><br />“We continue to evaluate the appropriateness of areas that can meet the goals of the mayor’s housing plan,” she added.<br /><br />Development advocates also cheered the effort.<br /><br />“This speaks to a new paradigm,” said Moses Gates, a planning director at the Association for Neighborhood &amp; Housing Development.<br /><br />“Communities and the administration are working together for the best way to figure out affordable housing.”<br /><br />erosenberg@nydailynews.com

				Dear neighbors,<br /><br />This is an extremely important issue that merits our attention.<br /><br />Development of affordable housing at transit-accessible locations throughout the city is a top priority for our new Mayor.&nbsp; The area proposed by the CB2 chair for rezoing in Woodside is, by many measures, an ideal location for more housing development, since the area is underdeveloped relative to surrounding areas, and it is near transit lines with surplus capacity (the M and R lines under Broadway).&nbsp; I&#039;ve attached a map showing the location mentioned in the article.&nbsp; This area could potentially support quite a lot of new housing if the city chooses to rezone it at a high density.<br /><br />The impacts of this on our neighborhood could be significant.&nbsp; On one hand, it has the potential to further burden our already overcrowded schools and parks.&nbsp; On the other hand, an influx of new people and businesses in the development of what could effectively be a new neighborhood center could be a great benefit to our community.&nbsp; If the city decides to take action on this, there will be an extended period of public debate (as mandated by the city&#039;s rezoning and ULURP processes).<br /><br />No doubt, there will be many in our community who will oppose the proposal, whatever it may turn out to be, because they don&#039;t want to see more housing development in our neighborhood.&nbsp; But I see potential in it.&nbsp; If we organize as a community and reach out early to our elected officials, we can help shape this proposal to ensure that it helps improve our community.&nbsp; We can and must demand that the plans provide for more park space and school seats, to ease the chronic shortages of both faced in the surrounding area.&nbsp; And I think we should demand that the plans provide for a of mix of land uses, including neighborhood-serving retail along Broadway and Northern, as well as opportunities to preserve some of the light industrial space in the area for neighborhood-compatible studios and workshops.&nbsp; All of this will cost some money, and my personal view is that we should jump at a chance for denser development in order to secure these community benefits (especially new green space).<br /><br />That&#039;s just my view.&nbsp; Does anybody else agree, or have a different vision they want to share?&nbsp; Is anybody interested in collaborating on a letter we might send to our elected officials laying out some benchmarks for what we believe a viable proposal needs to include?&nbsp; The Department of City Planning is actively working on rezoning proposals right now, so time is of the essence if we want to have our ideas considered in the initial proposal.

				Hi Todd,<br />I agree that this is an extremely important and potentially beneficial opportunity. If the community gets organized early, we&#039;re much more likely to end up with a development that makes western Queens a pleasant place to live. I&#039;m definitely up for contributing to a letter, coming to meetings, etc.

				&nbsp;Thanks for the heads up here. We should as a community get organized on this one. Otherwise we will have a ring of <br />super high rises surrounding the neighborhood. We have no natural breathing area like a coastline to lessen the impact. <br />Schools are very crowded in most areas already along with a number of other services.<br />&nbsp;Here&#039;s one spot to watch out for - the White Castle offices on 34th Ave and 69th/70th sts look like they are closed.<br />A contractor would have a full block of 34th ave to work with and most likely see little opposition as most people crap up <br />this area with excess trash anyway (even though JHBG had made huge progress cleaning the street up). The bowling <br />alley and pool hall are nicely run establishments though and the kidney dialysis and Regal Heights centers make for all<br />day presence in the neighborhood. BUT having this type of land available is exactly the precedent we should be concerned about.

You live in New York City. But seriously - this is beyond NIMBY, this is NIMNBY (not in my neighbor&#039;s back yard?)<br /><br />I for one enthusiastically support affordable high-rise development on or next to dense transit hubs. The area immediately around the 61st Street hub could certainly use some improvement, and frankly, any building that blocks the 7 Train tracks between here and Sunnyside would probably be of benefit to the neighborhoods by cushioning train noise. Northern Boulevard, meanwhile, is utterly unlovely and is built way too low considering the huge street width, as is the part of Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside/Woodside.<br /><br />What the community needs to get organized on is not to stop the residential development that we so desperately need in a city where people are living in basement rabbit warrens because there aren&#039;t enough affordable apartments - but to make sure that development targets the working-class New Yorkers who actually need to live here, as opposed to the global economic elite or international absentee owners looking for places to park their money (cough cough, Vin Chu Towers).

				Is it NIMBY to want development to scale and not the atrocious scenarios that have played out in Long Island City <br />and Williamsburg with oversized high-rises going to the highest bidders? How about some lower scale townhouses <br />or more 6story Jackson Heights style housing? More towers like our original Towers. Or more Phipps apartments<br />who still gets frequent visits from architecture students for their inventiveness and affordability?

				I&#039;d be happy to take a first cut at drafting something.&nbsp; But first, are we agreed on the key principles?&nbsp; Here are my suggestions:<br /><br />1. No net increase in the area&#039;s elementary school seat deficit.<br />1a.&nbsp; Specifically mention expanding PS 152?<br />1b.&nbsp; Also call for more middle school seats?<br /><br />2. Substantial new park space, addressing a longstanding need for the surrounding area<br />2a.&nbsp; Be more specific, e.g. stating that the park should include a turf play field like at Bushwick Inlet Park?&nbsp; (Since it appears that Travers Park will be moving in the direction of less active play space in the upcoming redesign)<br />2b.&nbsp; Propose a location for the park? (My fantasy location for this is between Northern and 34th, 62nd Street and the CSX tracks, with 64th Street demapped for that block)<br /><br />3. Neighborhood-serving retail corridors along Broadway and Northern, with curb cuts and parking lots prohibited.<br />3a. Must make provisions for a supermarket within nearby walking distance<br /><br />4. Zoning should preserve some of the light industrial space in the area for neighborhood-compatible studios and workshops. <br /><br />5. Other community wants/needs?<br />5a. Expand scope to include community-oriented rezoning of Northern Blvd. in the 60s and 70s?<br /><br />6. In exchange for the above, we&#039;d be willing to accept significantly higher densities in the area indicated.<br /><br />Do people think these are reasonable and feasible requests?&nbsp; Does anybody think the details should be different?&nbsp; Post your comments, and then I&#039;ll try my hand at drafting something early next week.<br /><br />

Rail is the best way to move large numbers of people. That said, Northern between 74th and 79th is pretty awful, and there have got to be better ways to use that space. Considering that the community was unable to even figure out how to give Travers Park the rest of its block, though, that may be a hopeless cause.

				That&#039;s a really interesting point, dssjh.&nbsp; &nbsp;The times have certainly changed, at least in some parts of NYC.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what&#039;s happening now on previously-cleared land on the Lower East Side:<br />http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/302-13/mayor-bloomberg-plans-major-mixed-use-development-long-vacant-seward-park-area-on#/0<br />Absolutely massive development.<br /><br />The market won&#039;t support anything of that scale in Ironbound Woodside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think high-rises are a real possibility there.&nbsp; But there&#039;s a middle ground, like the wonderfully livable, high-density urban forms we have in Jackson Heights.

I remember when I was a kid people were talking about *shrinking* the city&#039;s housing stock.

				I&#039;d also say that any housing created have a good mix of &quot;affordable&quot; and middle income apartments because &quot;affordable&quot; generally only refers to low income.&nbsp; That&#039;s not good for anyone because it either remains highly subsidized or its owners neglect it because it&#039;s not adequately profitable.&nbsp; In the end, you end up with the equivalent of poorly run housing projects.&nbsp; That&#039;s not even getting into the negative social issues.<br /><br />I think what the city also needs is another massive round of Mitchell Lama housing as the old developments continue to leave the program.
