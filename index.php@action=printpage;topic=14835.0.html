				&nbsp;This is v. bad. I hope they take another look at the redesign of the park and take police protection into consideration. <br />The Northern Blvd side of the park has fewer people around and can feel desolate especially near these basketball courts. <br />Hope he recovers quickly and this is a one-off incident. But gang recruitment looks to be alive and well at the middle <br />schools in the area.

				That&#039;s awful!&nbsp; I&#039;m glad he&#039;s ok.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t even that late when it happened and there are usually children playing in that park.&nbsp; I hope the police being to crack down on the gangs here and step up patrols as well.&nbsp; This certainly isn&#039;t a very safe area to live, as far as gangs, drugs, and sex trafficking are concerned.

				After the double stabbing a few months ago, police at the monthly meeting mentioned that cameras were successful at deterring gang activity.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping considering this recent development, coupled with that they know Travers is home to gang activity, that they consider cameras.

				This is NOT an isolated incident. There have been at least three others in the immediate vicinity within the last month or so. The 115th has done nothing. I live near there and have not seen a police presence (aside from them going to 711 to get coffee). I&#039;ve lost faith in our precint years ago. They do not care about this community.

				Couldn&#039;t agree with you more Bella. They&#039;re good at giving lip service and that&#039;s about it. I love when I see cars double parked and making illegal turns with cops in their cars doing nothing. This stabbing is serious but if they can&#039;t address the little things how can we expect them to address something like this.

				http://jacksonheightspost.com/town-hall-on-gang-violence-scheduled-after-stabbing-in-travers-park/<br /><br />May 16, By Michael Florio<br /><br />An uptick in gang violence will be discussed at a town hall meeting next week.<br /><br />The town hall will take place May 26 at 6 p.m., at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights (37-06 77th St.). The meeting comes after an 18-year-old was assaulted and stabbed while playing basketball last week at Travers Park (34th Avenue between 77th and 78th Streets).<br /><br />The teen was playing basketball at 8 p.m. on May 9, when seven to 10 men in all black surrounded him and asked if he was a member of a local gang, A.B.K. (Always Banging Kings), according to the NYPD.<br /><br />The victim said “no” and was assaulted by the men. He was stabbed in the back, which punctured his lung, according to police. He was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.<br /><br />The attack is being investigated as gang-related. No arrests have been made at this time and the investigation is ongoing.<br /><br />“We are deeply concerned by reports of a teenager who fell victim to a gang related crime in Jackson Heights earlier this week,” Council Member Daniel Dromm and State Sen. Jose Peralta said in a joint statement. “We urge anyone with information on the suspects’ whereabouts to call the police immediately.”<br /><br />“The city recently added 1,300 additional police officers to the force this year in order to further reduce crime in our neighborhoods,” they continued. “We will continue to do all that we can to put an end to gang related violence. We are working closely with the NYPD to bring this culprit to justice.”<br /><br />There have been a number of possible gang related incidents in Jackson Heights in the past couple of months.<br /><br />A 16-year-old was walking his dog at the intersection of Northern Boulevard and 80th Street on March 12, when two men stopped him and asked if he was “down with A.B.K.” before stabbing him in the abdomen and his dog in the back.<br /><br />Just hours later, a 23-year-old male was stabbed in the back by an unknown male with a sharp object, in front of 80-03 Northern Blvd., according to police. The victim was approached from behind. The suspects also referenced A.B.K. in this incident, police said.

				Come tonight to the 115th Precinct Council Meeting. <br />It&#039;s at 7pm at the Precinct.<br /><br />Hear from the Inspector and other officers about what is happening, ask questions and discuss your concerns.<br />This is the right place to collaborate and give your opinion.<br />Let&#039;s work together to make JH the place you want it to be.<br />This is the proactive approach.

				Tonight is a regular 115th Precinct Council Meeting.<br />The last one (last month) the big topic was the Salvation Army Church Block Party. The event was fun however, there was a major issues that impacted the residents in the area. This month I suspect a major discussion will be the recent events including gangs, attacks and neighborhood safety.<br /><br />The leader of the Precinct is an appointed Inspector and he attends. Also other officers who are involved with youth services, gangs and other issues. There are also representatives from the Community Board and the various elected officials. First there are reports from the Precinct and the residents who attend become involved with the topic. I am sure there will be lots of discussion tonight. I also feel that this will be important meeting to attend.<br /><br />The Townhall on the 26th, will also be a place to discuss the recent issues (i.e.gangs). There will be some review of the issues and events. There will also be some reporting of actions taken and plans that will be put into place.<br /><br />The Precinct Meeting is always a good one to attend. I highly recommend attending tonight and on an ongoing basis.

				<strong>The 115th Precinct Council Meeting summary:</strong><br /><br />The Police reviewed the situation. They mentioned that there are several gangs in the surrounding area. There were members of one gang harassing a young man in the park. They thought he was a member of another gang. At this point there was nothing to report regarding any gang membership for the young man who was stabbed.<br /><br />The plan going forward is to increase patrols around Travers park as well other other sites in the area using the gang unit, the drug unit, other special units and regular patrols. Some of these patrols will be in plain clothes to be unidentifiable but they will be there. <br /><br />There will another meeting next month.<br />

				The Precinct shifts their deployment of officers daily depending on events and need. Until the recent event with the stabbing, there were other areas thought to have a more pressing need. However with this event Travers has become a more of a hot spot so they are changing the pattern of deployment. <br /><br />Since this is a daily decision, I an not say for how long Travers will continue to get the extra patrols. But for now, there are many eyes of the park.

				What this means is that there is no permanent source of surveillance/ protection for a densely populated area.&nbsp; Better to put the rookies there then no one at all.
