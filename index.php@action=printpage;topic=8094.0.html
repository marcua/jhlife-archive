				We&#039;re looking for wings for the game on Sunday. I&#039;m personally rooting for UFC, but I think my husband is hoping for a more traditional buffalo wing. So,which pizza place, diner or chinese food joint serves the best hot wings? And hopefully delivers?<br /><br />Thanks!

				UFC really does serve the best, and the hot are pretty hot. none of the pizza places serve up anything other than frozen stuff you could get at met food.<br /><br />cassidy&#039;s on 31st/75th might be an option, but that&#039;s a go to place, not a bring-to-you place.

				I&#039;m a regular at American Chicken at 78-07 37th Ave but never had the Buffalo Chicken Wings.&nbsp; You may want to pick up just one order today and see if you like them.&nbsp; If you do, you can order for Sunday and they do deliver.&nbsp;

				American Chicken&#039;s buffalo wings are not &quot;buffalo-style,&quot; made with hot sauce &amp; butter and served with celery &amp; blue cheese dressing. <br />They are breaded and fried. Not bad, but not traditional Buffalo chicken wings.

				I am not a fan of UFC either, I just can&#039;t get into it - though plenty of people love it. Agreed with Cassidy&#039;s, but they ARE really good. There&#039;s Merit farms, which aren&#039;t as good as they could be, but it&#039;s cute that they have them. Louie&#039;s pizza is closed on Sunday. <br /><br />Maybe the new Mr Bruno&#039;s next to Canelle??<br /><br />Lots of the chinese take-outs actually have great wings and quite cheap. They are just fried wings, and if you put hot sauce on them, they are quite good. I once had a chicken wing competition thing around here, and the results were that the differences weren&#039;t that noticeable.

				Yeah, I was looking on seemless at Yummy Taco (chinese mexican) and they have 50 buffalo wings for $21.19, which is pretty cheap. I&#039;ve never eaten there, so I can&#039;t vouch for them.<br /><br />I love me some UFC, but they&#039;re pretty pricey at $18 for 20. I usually get the half chicken, Soy Garlic and BBQ Mustard.
