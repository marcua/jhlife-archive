				City: Travers Park rebuild won&#039;t completed until 2018 <br />NYC Parks has completed the design phase of the long-awaited Travers Park renovation about a year behind schedule, according to the Jackson Heights Post. The Travers Park reconstruction attempts to unify Travers Park, the 78th Street Pedestrian Plaza and Staunton Field into one, much-greener recreation area with a minimum of fences separating it from the surrounding streets and community.<br /><br />update from JHBG

				Unfortunately, the construction has been delayed again and now won&#039;t start until 2018. Just heard this from NYC Parks&#039; District Manager for our area of Queens. It&#039;s supposed to be done in phases so some of the park is open at all times, but that also means the work will take longer since they are not working on all of it at once.

				Government procurement is a slow, broken process. A simple thing like one small portion of an insurance certificate expiring can cause a delay until it&#039;s renewed. There are usually multiple agencies involved, which makes things even slower. There are so many little things that cause major delays that I personally think it&#039;s a miracle any time a project gets completed. There is just so much red tape. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				IMHO. there are lots of reasons why Travers Park reconstruction is slower than hoped for, and I don&#039;t think any of them are union related.<br />&nbsp;First was the dispute between Park and Transportation Department over control/responsibility for play street, (which is transportation property.) That may sound silly to us, but when you have a department and a certain amount of money to spend, you don&#039;t want to get stuck with an open-ended financial liability, which brings us to the mysterious infrastructure beneath the ground that needs to be scouted out.<br />Also, government is slow compared to private industry because there is no need for public oversight there.<br />Finally there is the requirement that at least part of the park remain open throughout the reconstruction. Back in the early-mid 1990s the park was rebuilt all at once and the contractor defaulted. The park was closed for three years if I correctly recall.<br />&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t think NYC Parks ever said it was going to take less than 18 months to renovate Travers Park. The department always said they would renovate in phases so that some part of the park is *always open. <br />I don&#039;t see how the &quot;Great Lawn atop Mount Jackson Heights&quot; could possibly be open this year. The sod needs to be rolled out and have a growing season to properly root before people do what they do atop it. I don&#039;t know if that means it can open in the fall or next year. <br />To answer someone else&#039;s question, there is to be a completely seperate renovation of the kiddie area under a plan announced, I think, early last summer at the park. This came ab out when new funding became available.<br /><br />*Back around 1994, the entire park was closed for 18 months to two years due to a problem with the contractor who had started the work and the job had to be rebid. We may justifiably complain about somethings, but NYC Parks is much better run the last couple of decades.

				&nbsp;Sadly, there was a fight in the first week of this part of the park being opened with middle schoolers from different schools. No<br />serious casualties but there was a knife and a baseball bat involved. Some people did not think closing the street was a good <br />idea based on police getting to the area from Northern Blvd and am part of that group.Hope this was a one off problem but <br />am wishing for more police presence in Travers Park- even though that has opposition too. I think the open areas are a <br />skateboarders dream but am wondering if that was the intent? Kind of doubt it.

				I don&#039;t wander around that time of the morning either. Two nights last week I was awakened by fights between two groups of what sounded like drunken men celebrating the closing of the local bars by moving their party to the park benches. When I went to work at 6 AM there were still a few rowdies passing a bottle and arguing, but no longer as loud. I did notice a couple of nervous dog walkers that were closer, so they might have a better report of what went on. I don&#039;t believe these people bothered to read the sign with the hours of operation. It&#039;s a convenient place to party if you don&#039;t mind waking the neighborhood.

The dealership is owned by Howard Koeppel, who has long been cozy with politicians such as Mayor Giuliani and Queens power broker Joe Crowley, the former congressman.<br /><br />“We are working on some minor revisions to the design … in order to provide for limited vehicular access,” said Parks Department spokeswoman Meghan Lalor. “Once those revisions are finalized, we will share them with the Community Board.”</em><br /><br /><strong>[Click on above link for full article]</strong>

				Anyone know what happened today at Travers park with police and ambulance coming? I saw few kids playing on a tennis court when two men with two aggressive dogs came, one dog was biting pants of one of the men. When police came one man (on 77th street) was taken by ambulance and they didn&#039;t even talk to the guy with the dogs. He was then laughing when they just went through the park not caring about anything! <br /><br />If anyone knows what happened, please share. I thought it was great to finally see kids playing on the court instead of dogs, but it didn&#039;t last long. I complained to 311 but I guess no one cares. <br /><br />

				As a long-time park and environmental sustainability advocate, I&#039;m a little conflicted about this matter.<br />If were starting from scratch on that site, I would prefer all of 78th Street to be closed down for the park. As someone who was involved in the park expansion from the beginning, I&#039;m kind of mystified by the changes here. I remember that the the Garden School and the car dealership, originally Queensboro Toyota, would have access to the northern most segment of the street. Clearly something changed and the entire street was to become parkland. And then it wasn&#039;t. <br />I think we need to remember that Jackson Heights and it&#039;s organizations won a huge victory to expand and recreate the park. I&#039;m concerned that closing the northern-most end of 78th Street would cause an undo burden for the school and car dealership that will not provide a substantial benefit.<br />This is not to criticize those working to extend the park all the way to Northern Boulevard, but personally I think we&#039;d be better off spending our energies looking for new park/open space in Jackson Heights; opportunities to make our neighborhood more environmentally sustainable, AND&nbsp; helping NYC Parks maintain Travers Park.<br />JHBG&#039;s Friends of Travers Park is revving up again after the park&#039;s two year shutdown. If you are interested in participating in Friends of Travers Park, contact me at lenmaniace@gmail.com with FOTP in the subject line, Thank you.<br />And Happy Earth Day! <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Haha ... what travers park advocates are on the side of a car dealership vs more park space.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who even wants a car dearlship in the hood?&nbsp; They take up tons of parking and illegal park all over an overcrowded northern making driving sight-lines more dangerous.&nbsp; They never get ticketed. <br /><br />In fact that road in question is a no parking or stoping anytime.

Finally a modicum of clarity. The dealership/building owner originally agreed to the park design and then changed his mind about using the 78th street entrance half way through the park renovation. After their own renovation I figure.<br /><br />It is a legal matter I guess. And will need to be fought in court. <br /><br />Did the Park Dept get the original acquiescence in writing?<br /><br />I hope so.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Questions to ask of this discussion thread:<br />- If this protest were to take place in July, how many of the people that were there would be <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;vacationing elsewhere and how many of the people in the park at that time would want that<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;street inset closed? I suspect you would have a vastly different answer. The inset has been <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;used as I have seen it for PreK drop offs, NYC Dept of Parks workers, NYPD and others who<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;need to pull of Northern Blvd as well as the dealership. There is a sizable group who oppose<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;closing this street and as they are not running for office, they would like to see this stay<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;functioning as is. They also remember times when the park was not so safe and that police<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;access, particularly on hot summer nights, was wanted. Many of my friends and their children<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;have had &quot;incidents&quot; of some degree in the park. Theft, assault, verbal abuse, etc and as<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;most users know, there is little oversight within the park. This is only one of many reasons<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;that people like this inset available- safety.<br /><br />- Who/what aspects of the community are represented here? The people who live on 77th street<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;buildings and will be tremendously effected? Rainbowland Nursery School? Bus riders on <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Northern Blvd? The huge amount of school children on 77th, 78th, 79th and 80th streets? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The many teachers who are commuting from out of the neighborhood to this area which <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;has long been used by a number of schools for little kids to 12th grade? The big answer is<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;the majority of those opposing here are only focused on getting this teeny tiny weird space <br />&nbsp; (two big walls and a street on 3 sides space) for the park. Whoever thinks this wouldn&#039;t <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;immediately become a&nbsp; sports venue (makeshift soccer/cricket field)&nbsp; hasn&#039;t been at Travers Park <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;at 4:00 on a stinking hot Saturday in July. And who in their right mind would add to the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;traffic on 79th street on a school day? Have you ever been there when school lets out?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;We need every possible outlet at that time.<br /><br />&nbsp;- Why is all the lead focus on these few sq yards of 78th Street on Koeppel? Because of the profile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; they have and yes, I have bought cars at Koeppel, as have so many of my neighbors which<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; is why they have the successful business they do here. And they have lawyers that the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; renters on 77th street won&#039;t be able to afford as their street would be adversely affected <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by this change too. Do not work there but like them as a business- which like others in <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; the vicinity are dealerships, schools, drugstores, restaurants, convenience stores, etc. who<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; pay taxes which make things like parks more viable on top of our real estate and sales taxes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As Koeppel&#039;s is a gay-owned business in a diverse neighborhood and a business that has <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; been HUGELY supportive of neighborhood activities, I think that the attack on them is not <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; civil. It smacks of someone with a thin resume who needs to pad it somehow and has picked <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; this as a &quot;W&quot; to put beside their name. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully, we will have many people who are planning to run for Danny Dromm&#039;s seat<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and they will treat all of the residents and businesses whose lives and livelihoods are<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;changed by neighborhood projects, not just those who are fully &quot;networked&quot; as the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;one side. Be civil. Hear all sides of the story. Be on the ground asking peoples opinions<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;and knock on doors of all the locals. This is two sided debate and wish both sides would be <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;respected here. This goes for the DOT, Danny&#039;s office and Parks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Encouraging lots of new candidates here to run for Councilman!!

				i&#039;m still curious about what, if any, financial interest ItsIt has in this matter. <br /><br />and, yes, a multitude of candidates should come forward. we&#039;ve had a wonderful rep in Danny Dromm (who&#039;s far more receptive to the community than recent predecessors were) and i hope that run continues with whoever is elected next.<br />

				Dromm comes across as a big idiot bully who obviously has no understanding of property rights. That curb cut is in front of a wide garage door that enters a service garage. Toyota used to use it and they moved a few blocks away. So the service center was closed till Mazda reopened it. There are many hydraulic lifts installed behind those doors. It is a approved DOB driveway for over 50 years. The NYC DOT knew that it was because they left the street there. The city should of contacted the owner of the property and bought his rights to use his curb cut and garage access. This would need to be in writing and recorded. Then the city could remove the curb. Dromm states openly “take it and let them sue the city to try to take it back”. He is advocating the government seizure of land without any compensation. That is what was done in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. That land will be worth much less without that crucial side entrance for the service department. Clearly this land is worth over $10 million. I believe this whole controversy is over a small section of street that should remain as it is. This street also allows cars to safely move off Northern Blvd for dropping off children. It is really a shame that our elected official is nothing more than a mindless tyrant.

				I noticed the owners of this dealership are illegally storing their cars in front of their property. The law is pretty clear on this. I would be more concerned about safety with them&nbsp; DRIVING ON THE ACTUAL SIDEWALK TO STORE THEIR CARS, than the legal driveway they use. Has anyone called 311 to report this illegal situation? I have, but the more calls, the more enforcement.

				Let&#039;s be serious. The garage exit poses no threat to children playing in the park. This used to be a much more heavily trafficked street before the park took over the rest of the street. I don&#039;t recall there being any problems then. Why make a big deal of it now? I&#039;m more concerned with the loss of the playing field. We used to have tennis, softball, soccer and cricket (sometimes all at the same time) in addition to the soccer games in The Garden School&#039;s schoolyard. Plus roller hockey years ago. Now just tag and Frisbee, I guess.

By the look of it, seems it will end at the driveway to the chop shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />i don&#039;t personally mind, the park still looks great.&nbsp; the dealership has a legit gripe.&nbsp; <br />I feel it should never have came to this.&nbsp; It was a major miss by our sleeping local politicians to have not eminent domain the dealership when it was for sale.&nbsp; would have been a perfect place for a library or something.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;I was wondering the same thing. There has been radio silence lately. I think the park looks <br />great and all the older folks now have a place to sit even if most of the athletics are gone.<br />It will be easier now to get monies for Jackson Heights becoming more of a NORC- naturally<br />occurring retirement community- as we have few resources for seniors now. <br />&nbsp;The last I heard was that it became less of a community decision and more of a political<br />thing so we will see what that falls. The police presence on the corner of 34th and 77th<br />with the squad car is a welcome and less intrusive presence. Am not sure how to feel about<br />all the vendors though and who will ultimately win the territory.

				Spotted on a cold winter morning ... the new tennis court seems be an off season large drug run.&nbsp; We have about 6-8 medium to large dogs off leash pissing and shitting about the nice huge fenced in yard <br /><br />These deplorable dog owners are like roaches.&nbsp; You just can’t keep them away
