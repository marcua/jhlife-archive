			Hi Neighbors --<br /><br />My cousin recently passed away during this health crisis and l need to find a new home for her dachshund mix. Patrick is 13-years-old and a complete couch potato. He likes nothing more than hanging out at home with his owner and going out for walks. He&#039;s healthy, is up to date on his vaccinations, micro-chipped and neutered. He would best suit a home without other pets and small children as he doesn&#039;t like to be fussed with or overly handled. He&#039;s a great dog for a single person or a couple.<br /><br />
