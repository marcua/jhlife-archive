				which is your place in maspeth? joeys? rosas? Ive heard good things about rosas and was just so so with joeys. I am a big fan of Johns though. I think they are one of the best in the borough. THE best though, in my opinion, and this might start a firestorm of pizza opinions, is Amore in flushing. That place is something else.

				Great topic.&nbsp; Our last conversation like this died out a year ago (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=138.0), so it&#039;s about time to revive it!<br /><br />As I wrote in that other thread, I&#039;d love to see a good Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why Steinway St. should have a monopoly!&nbsp; It would be welcomed by people in our neighborhood looking for healthier and/or vegetarian options, as well as people looking for Halal alternatives.&nbsp; <br />

				forgive me but other than pizza, i don&#039;t want a single one of those things creeping in.<br /><br />why?<br /><br />because i lived on the lower east side before it was a theme park<br /><br />i lived in greenpoint before it was a silly suburb of williamsburg -- where the residents would have urinated on your foot if you used the word &#039;billyburg&#039;<br /><br />and i lived in bed stuy before it was &#039;adorable&#039;<br /><br />when you bring in homogenizing elements like wine bars, von dutch pickup joints, french bistros run by idiots from pasaaic and the like, you displace the pillars of what makes a community a community. no more deshi biryani. no more tacolandia. no more tibetan fast food. no more arunee. just street after street of what&#039;s made south brooklyn both insanely expensive and thoroughly worthless.

				I don&#039;t know dsshj, most of the things people are posting are not exactly things that would turn the neighborhood into Smith Street.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see people mentioning french bistros or twee little shops.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m easy - all I want is a nice, big supermarket (doesn&#039;t have to be fancy, just clean and well stocked) and an express bus that goes to Wall Street.&nbsp; The only express bus here is useless for my needs.&nbsp; A bookstore would be great too but I don&#039;t think it would make it here.&nbsp; Rents are way too high.&nbsp;

				oh, i guess i was painting with a broad brush...but i was referring to the initial list that was heavier on &#039;hipster rock and roll bar&#039; and things of that ilk.<br /><br />i&#039;d love a bookstore, actually.<br /><br />and as far as an express bus, i understand your desire for one, and it wouldn&#039;t be bad, but it&#039;s not really feasible if you think about it -- no other outer borough neighborhood this close to manhattan has one (park slope is the same distance from downtown -- maybe even further -- than we are from midtown) and i doubt the area really has enough residents willing to pay double the subway fare for express service....<br /><br />just my two cents

				&nbsp;I was born on the LES lived in brooklyn for a number of years and in JH for around 20 yrs or so. It is not asking too much for a place that plays english music (no offense I speak fluent spanish) this neighborhood does not have a place like that. What makes it a community? 99c junk stores and chicken places?&nbsp; The neighborhood is changing and going up in price and with that there are demands for things we don&#039;t have what is the big deal?? I&#039;d rather buy in my community than go to say Forest hills or astoria.

				my list:<br />1. a really fantastic grocery store - clean, inviting, and with great offerings. While Met is a step up from the C-Town near me, in which there are birds living on the rafters, it isn&#039;t quite as appetizing as I wish it were.<br />2. a pub with good beers on tap, nice atmosphere, and a good burger wouldn&#039;t hurt, either<br />3. yes to the bookstore<br />4. nice brunch so I can stop pretending that Jahn&#039;s is anything other than a greasy spoon with old-time, day-glo orange character<br />5. more green space, and yes, I know Flushing meadows is out there, but it is <em>out there</em>, and not easy to get to<br />6. ditto to the Mediterranean restaurant (and yeah, I like Plaka, but it isn&#039;t close - at least not to me)<br />7. a clothing store that didn&#039;t sell hoochie shirts<br />8. a good pizza place. I am hopeful about the pizza/fresh pasta place going in on Baxter street, which technically is Elmhurst, but still only a 5 min walk for me. The guy told me there will be no freezers there and that they will be only using fresh mozz on their pizzas.<br />9. a place to buy some quality home things (other than the candles and soaps at Inner Peace)<br />10. a cellphone store<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />just kidding on #10

Governors Island style I mean, using golf cart to move people around the neighborhood bicycle sharing, collectivo and so on.<br /><br />Walkable 37 street with benches and food court&nbsp; outdoor in the summer, kind of The High Line - Meatpacking District <br /><br />Less trash on the floor and locked recycle collectors. <br /><br />More trees.<br /><br />Solar Panels on top of each roof.<br /><br />Huge community garden to grow edible food.<br /><br />Public Drinkable water in the streets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Paint the subway above Above Roosevelt Ave with serious Graffiti (no taggers please).<br />&nbsp;<br />Less pigeons.<br /><br /><br />

				okay, i know i risk getting flamed here and i really really really am not trying to be contrarian, but.....<br /><br /><br />perhaps i have lived in new york city too long (as in 25 years), but i remember a time when people didnt expect every single neighborhood to have every single possible amenity within a five block walk. where we actually celebrated the fact that neighborhoods had their own character, as opposed to a nice, neat &quot;one from columns a,b, c, d, e&quot; and so on kind of thing. the character is the reason i moved to and continue to live in jackson hts as opposed to one of the completely cookie-cutter neighborhoods that make up a good chunk of brooklyn. <br /><br />am i saying a 99 cent store is inherently better than a wine bar? no. but in reality -- not in pie in the sky theory -- there&#039;s a domino effect. replace one too many storefronts providing needed services and you lose those services for good. commercial landlords have proven, again and again and again, that they are both greedy and short sighted, and usually end up evicting the hardware store paying &quot;x&quot; per month for the imported tea emporium paying three times that, only to have the latter go under in six months and have a) a vacant storefront and b) a public that needs to take a subway to buy paint.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know about you, but in reality, i need dry cleaning more than i need mesclun.<br />

				This is a great topic that is worth bringing back.<br /><br />I think we now have some of the things that people were longing for over a year ago. I know we definitely have a dog run! I noticed recently that Armondo&#039;s has a Sunday brunch but I&#039;m not sure if this is a new thing. Unfortunately it does not begin until noon on Sundays. Personally, I really hate the word brunch and prefer to breakfast or lunch.<br /><br />Like just about everyone else, I&#039;d love to see more public green space. I definitely would not advocate to replace Travers Park&#039;s pavement with grass as it is a heavily utilized space the way it is but maybe somewhere, somehow, there could be more green space. One thought is the two lots that are on the corner of 74th Street and 34th Avenue, across from one another. One of the lots has an abandoned house written about here before. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4415.0 (ftp://http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4415.0)<br /><br />I&#039;d also love to see some of our restaurants along 37th Avenue offer outdoor eating on the sidewalks. I&#039;m sure this is a zoning issue and may require the sidewalks to be widened. I think it is one of those subtle things that increases the sense of community - you may be walking down 37th and come upon a friend or acquaintance having a meal outdoors, etc.<br /><br />I lived for 11 years in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn and there was a community based organization that was focused on Myrtle Avenue that did a lot of good things - and some things that could definitely be argued not so good. In any case I&#039;m sure there are some good ideas that could be applied to 37th Ave and Roosevelt Ave: http://myrtleavenue.org/<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">The last thing I wish for would be to make JacksonHeightsLife.com more easy to search for topics of interest!</span> If there is a way, can someone please tell me what it is. I&#039;d definitely use this site more.

				I only want two things as I&#039;ve given up on the grass and the bookstore.<br /><br />-I&#039;ve probably mentioned this five times. But I would love a soup/sandwich/salad place. Does someone know of a place where I can get a loaded salad that&#039;s not Wendy&#039;s?<br /><br />-A bar. A bar that I don&#039;t feel weird going into by myself as a young, non-Spanish speaking woman. One with decent wine, craft beers and/or cocktails. And by cocktails, I mean something more than twelve different types of sweetened martinis. And no, I&#039;m not asking for a hoity toity place where drinks are $15.<br /><br />I would probably spend a lot more money within the neighborhood if we had these things instead of going to Astoria or Brooklyn or Manhattan.<br /><br />I would also love some behavior problems fixed, but I know that&#039;s impossible. Such as honking, illegal u-turns in intersections, hand bills (does that really work as a form of advertising? maybe for the free-eye-exam dude?), public urination (why so high in JH?), less cars and more bikes, etc.

				Thanks for the welcome dssjh. I&#039;ve been a member for a while but I have not really utilized the site. I&#039;ll try to keep my eye on it more than I have in the past as there is a lot of great info here. I had a few days off recently that coincided with a cold that kept me in my apartment, leading me eventually to JHLife.<br /><br />I read about the abandoned house belonging to the school. Perhaps they will never get around to their expansion and someday they will want to sell the land. <br /><br />Since I don&#039;t have a car I don&#039;t mind less parking - without a doubt, I&#039;m sure some will disagree. The office I work in faces Broadway in Manhattan and overall I think it is really great what has happend with the new pedestrian plazas that have been made by narrowing the area for automobiles. I do wish they were more permanent looking but I suppose that will come with time. Perhaps something similar could be done on 37th or on a smaller scale on 82nd between 37th and Roosevelt.<br /><br />I hope this topic stays active as I&#039;d love to hear what people desire in the neighborhood. I also hope that Foxy gets a soup/salad/sandwich place and a different option to get a drink - I think they would be welcome additions to the neighborhood.

				I&#039;d LOVE LOVE LOVE a bookstore in the neighborhood. I&#039;d also like more restaurant options north of Northern...I know it&#039;s residential but sometimes I am too lazy after work to go to 37th Ave ;D I am really happy with the diversity of food options though. <br />El Coyote has a great brunch special but it would be nice to have a few more options.<br />And for those looking for a great burger, there actually is a place in the neighborhood for awesome burgers...Cassidy&#039;s on 75th &amp; 31st Ave. <br />I think that most people who desire these things really have to put their money where their mouth is if/when places we desire open up...I suspect that many of the places we say we&#039;d like to have in the neighborhood would close for lack of consistent steady business. I know I am guilty of not shopping as often as I should or would like to at great local places.<br />I&#039;d also really like a great public high school in Jackson Heights although by the time that ever happens, my daughter will probably be in college. It would also be great to have more public school options in general, it seems like every school is overcrowded.<br />&nbsp;
