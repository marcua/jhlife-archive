				Is it just me, or are there alot of co-ops for sale in the area lately? I know there&#039;s usually an increase in listed properties in most areas during the summer, as sellers try to capitalize on increased foot traffic.However, after perusing listings on Craigslist, Streeteasy and various broker sites, there seems to be quite a bit of inventory. Is it just the summer rush? Or are people fleeing the area?

				That report is definitely recommended reading if you want a general sense of trends in the hood.<br /><br />Notwithstanding those who would argue that real estate defies generalization, a casual browsing of recent ads suggests that the price/sq ft is down 5-10% year-over-year, unfortunately.&nbsp; Perhaps the glut in inventory has contributed to this...

				i think that the data is also depressed, fairly or not, by the monumental number of apartments in the northridge/southridge complexes. look at MLSLI listings, sort low to high, and the first several pages of listings are all clustered there -- since those places simply don&#039;t move at all.<br /><br />if we confine the search to units that are actually sellable, the market does look a bit healthier.

				Our experience thus far has shown that keeping inventory low in a building helps its sale prices. Therefore selling quickly is key to keep the availability low.<br />Here is a recent article on Colonial Court: <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/colonial-court-sees-a-spike-in-sale-prices/<br /><br />Warmest regards,<br />Armen J.

				Hi rhydewithdis<br /><br />The short answer is yes. We do have statistics on individual Coops. Sales and active listings are on public record, so they are easy to access at any point in time on the web. We have a roster of 25 buildings which we try to keep up to date. Look at it this way, if most buildings in the neighborhood have between complexes have approximately 120-160 units 4% turnover isn&#039;t that big of a number, we are talking 5-7 units per year. There are buildings like The Manchester that are just under 100 units, that are more effected by the general statistic - Manchester had 7 sales last year, that already puts them at over 7% turnover, but they have no units available for sale now. So once a unit comes to market there, it will most likely command a healthy sale price. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had to do statistical analysis for a client recently who brought multiple charts from Trulia.com, Red Fin and Property Shark, all of which had conflicting data. Why? it&#039;s because the web statistics do not break down Studios, One Bedrooms, 2 Bedrooms or Renovated or Unrenovated, low monthlies or high monthlies and based on square footage estimates in listings give a number per square foot that real estate can sell for in Jackson Heights. As a real estate professional I know first hand when there is a shortage of certain inventory. 2 bed + apartments and anything larger are in short supply, therefore there is a great price difference between at 950 sf one bedroom and a 1080sf 2 bedroom (100-125k to be exact). If they were priced on per square foot basis like the statistics suggest this would not be the case, do you agree?<br /><br />In my opinion as 2012 slowly comes to a close, and I say this is because most transactions going into contract now will close and register their sales in 2013, the inventory in Jackson Heights has diminished as the new unit owners truly believe in the neighborhood as we do. So inevitably we are going to see an improvement in all areas, prices included. <br />

				I wonder if more people are headed towards Astoria and LIC -- they seem to be getting the most attention lately. -- and lots is being built in LIC. JH doesnt seem to have that much hype lately, other than the annual article saying that it&#039;s a hidden gem.

				LIC is a difficult comparison to make as itâ€™s mostly consists of condos and is less known for a competing market share for coops. Astoria however is a good comparison to examine in order to understand how it compares to the heights in terms of itâ€™s buyer market share. <br /><br />Letâ€™s look at a very basic example based on what weâ€™ve seen prices in both markets:<br />2 Bedroom 1 bathy in Jackson Heights â€“ approximately $370,000 with monthlies of approx $850/mo - a 2 Bedroom 1 Bath Coop in Astoria on an average $470,000 with monthlies about 1000/mo.&nbsp; <br /><br />Letâ€™s presume that 80% financing is allowed for both scenarios. To maintain an approximate 25% debt to income ration on housing payment alone, buyer looking in Jackson Heights would need to make 6,500 gross per month and have assets of $80,000 for down payment and closing costs. Buyer in Astoria would need to make 10,750/month and have assets of $100,000 for down payment and closing costs.<br /><br />Now letâ€™s look:<br /><br />Buyer One:<br />Income $6500/month - $78,000 annually<br />Assets: $80,000<br /><br />Buyer Two:<br />Income: $10,750&nbsp; &nbsp;$129,000 annually<br />Assets: $100,000<br /><br />Jackson Heights is likely to be looked at by buyers from both buyer pools, but a buyer that can only afford Jackson Heights based on their income level are only likely to buy in Jackson Heights. In current economy we are more likely to find buyers that fit the profile of Buyer One, and it is common knowledge that Jackson Heights properties offer more living space. So for me there is really no need for hype or articles calling the area a gem to validate what is already a healthy market place that is in the league of its own. <br /><br />I hope you find this helpful. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen J.

But I do think from a buyer&#039;s perspective, you can certainly approach a sale in a building where there is inventory available and negotiate pricing per square foot basis (as you well could at the new developments in LIC). <br /><br />The caveat and where I would agree with you on this would be for apartments that are very atypical and desirable. For example a 2/3 bed 2 bath <span class="bbc_u">with</span> a terrace overlooking the garden <span class="bbc_u">and</span> on the top floor <span class="bbc_u">with</span> NYC views, etc.<br /><br />@Jeffsayyes, I would say that for the most part, the buyers looking at LIC and Jackson Heights, don&#039;t overlap very much. Most LIC&#039;ers wouldn&#039;t even consider JH b/c the are shopping at a $700-1000/sq. ft. price point and are looking for new+amenities+condo&#039;s, which is easily double the pricing in JH. There is also no buildings in JH that compare to a luxury building in LIC. Not that there aren&#039;t units/buildings which a subset of buyers would appreciate wayyyy more than any building unit/building in LIC, but overall, there is very little overlap.<br /><br />Astoria is mostly renters, inventory for buyers is mostly multi-family houses. Very hard to compare the co-op apartment&#039;s in Astoria b/c the inventory is tiny.<br />
