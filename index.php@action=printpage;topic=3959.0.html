				Shereen Mahal Restaurant at 37-56 74th St is gone, and Tawa Tandoor is moving in.&nbsp; At first, I hoped this might be an expansion of the Tawa Deli on 72nd Street that is a great place to buy Indian breads, but it appears that this is related to another Tawa Tandoor (http://midtownlunch.com/2009/12/21/tawa-tandoor-takes-over-old-soul-fixins-space/) that opened recently in the Theater District.<br /><br />

				Not that Shereen Mahal was amazing or anything, but I will miss the -24hour, catch me at the end of a long night, I need food - place it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, this will be a chain?&nbsp; Something tells me the new place is not going to catch me at 2am.

				I&#039;ve never been to Tawa Tandoor, so I don&#039;t have an opinion about it. &nbsp;But in fairness, I think it&#039;s important to note that many of the businesses in the neighborhood are &quot;chains&quot; in the sense that they have multiple locations in the region, or even internationally. &nbsp;The higher-end jewelery and sari shops have locations in London and India. &nbsp;Patel Brothers. Subzi Mandi, Apna Bazaar, and Rajbhog have multiple locations in the region. &nbsp;So does Jackson Diner (although under different names), Kabir&#039;s Bakery, Afghan Kebab House, Nanking, and probably others. &nbsp;Even Sripraphai is opening a new location! &nbsp;Multiple locations doesn&#039;t necessarily sacrifice quality.<br /><br />But I agree with you, citizenjane, I will miss Shereen Mahal, and will be very disappointed if its replacement is run-of-the-mill.

				I was really surprised when I learned that Patel Brothers had another store in Massachusetts.&nbsp; Even more surprised when I looked at their store locator online and saw that they have more than 30 stores located all throughout this half of the country and into Canada, including Texas, Chicago, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio.&nbsp; http://www.patelbros.com/ourstores.html<br />There is even one listed in Flushing.<br /><br />Some of them are called &quot;Cash and Carry&quot; so maybe those are convenience stores.

				shereen always struck me as near the bottom of the food chain (no pun intended) in the area. but it had its moments. if you want 24 hour south asian food, i think merit dumpling house on 74th is open 24-7 as well. very good kebabs and, in the back, ace momo.

				According to the following site, Tawa Tandoor is owned by the same people behind Nanking.&nbsp; Is it safe to assume that this is the Nanking we have a location of in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; By the way, we also have a thread on Nanking here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1046.0).<br /><br />Tawa Tandoor (http://newyork.metromix.com/restaurants/indian/tawa-tandoor-midtown-west/1686896/content)

				you guys are right, I shouldn&#039;t be so dismissive. I just don&#039;t expect much from an foreign food place coming out of Manhattan (except japanese, maybe korean). <br />I wonder what they did with that oven they cooked the naan in. I&#039;d love to have that thing in my apt. make pizzas on it.

				Shelby- Cash and Carry stores are restaurant supply outlets.&nbsp; It allows retail food operators to buy in bulk without having to buy too much of anything.&nbsp; Its good for smaller retailers who dont have stellar credit or tons of cash on hand.&nbsp; Costco operates this way for both resale and non-resale consumers.&nbsp; <br /><br />:)&nbsp;

				interesting, as mehfil is far and away my least favorite south asian in the neigborhood. i&#039;ve found very little to like in the east 20s array of indian places. by no means does jackson hts offer the best stuff -- southern spice in flushing and a few of the places in floral park are better by leaps and bounds -- but i&#039;d say that some of the dishes (chicken 65, chicken chettinad) at delhi heights are amazing. kababish offers an amazing bang for the buck, the chat (pani puri, especially) at bombai chat on 37 road is very very good as is the mysore masala dosa at dosa place.<br /><br /><br />btw, editing to indicate this is a response to marky mark :)
