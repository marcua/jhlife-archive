				I noticed in the CB3 agenda that there&#039;s a liquor license application for &quot;Tomo Japanese Cuisine Inc., 86-12A 37th Avenue&quot;.&nbsp; A quick web search turned up this site for a Japanese restaurant on Queens Blvd that is opening a second location in our neighborhood:<br />http://www.tomojc.com/index.html<br /><br />This sounds exciting!&nbsp; Has anybody tried the original location?

				Haven&#039;t tried the original location but did happen to notice it the other day on my long walk back from the NYSC in Rego Park!&nbsp; Looking forward to having more sushi options here.&nbsp; Thanks for the heads up.<br /><br />And it gets pretty decent reviews (3 of them) on yelp. http://www.yelp.com/biz/gige0Bps68Lk974vKytbGQ

				I find Happy Kitchen mediocre at best. We&#039;ve ordered delivery from East 21 and it was much, much better. Happy Kitchen&#039;s Udon Noodles have no flavor. They don&#039;t use much spice in their dishes.

				I will tell you all a secret about Happy Kitchen, besides high prices, the co-owner makes the sushi to cut down on costs, and they also take the waiters tips for themselves.<br /><br />Also notice it is cash only, thats a bit shady

				what does that have to do with shady?&nbsp; I&#039;m not a huge fan of HK, but plenty of places are cash only, due to the fact that credit cards cost the restaurant money.<br /><br />And the owner making the sushi to cut costs?&nbsp; Big whoop!&nbsp; What restaurant owner doesn&#039;t want to cut costs?&nbsp; If she is capable and willing to do it, what does it matter?<br /><br />Again, not a fan, but the only thing that seems bothersome is taking the waiters&#039; tips....but then, what waiter would stand for that and not quit immediately?<br />

				HK may not be the best sushi in the world but it&#039;s decent. The spicy crunchy rolls (especially the shrimp and eel) are actually very good. I don&#039;t order as often as I&#039;d like cause it&#039;s a bit pricier than it should be but when I&#039;m craving sushi, it&#039;s worth it. One dish I love from them is the hijiki -- very tasty.<br /><br />As for the people who work there, they&#039;re all incredibly nice (especially the delivery man -- he&#039;s a total sweetheart). If you ever want to know anything about the history of Jackson Heights, ask the guy who takes orders on Saturday night. He loves to talk about the neighborhood.

				I agree.&nbsp; Happy Kitchen serves decent sushi and some excellent other dishes, especially for such a tiny place.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s wonderful to have them here, and am especially grateful for their proprietors&#039; efforts on behalf of the historic district.&nbsp; &nbsp;I enjoy East 21 too, but have found their quality inconsistent at times.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to Tomo because I enjoy sushi best in a real restaurant setting, but unless their offerings are qualitatively different, I will probably continue to patronize Happy Kitchen for takeout.

				I think the best sushi by far in the neighborhood is at the Korean/Japanese place on 74th street where Broadway and Roosevelt all merge.&nbsp; It caters primarily to a Korean crowd, and a lot of the stuff on the menu isn&#039;t even properly translated.&nbsp; But the food is FANTASTIC.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I would be delighted to have sushi closer to home.&nbsp;

				KC - thanks for the tip about the place on 74th and Broadway, next to Thai Son (the latter of which has excellent food).<br /><br />I had been in the sushi place once to request a menu for my menu book at home.&nbsp; not only did they not have a take away menu, but the place smelled so fishy that i wrote the place off.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to give it another shot!

				For some reason, I never end up ordering sushi in a Korean restaurant.&nbsp; Everytime I think of it, I get deterred by the prices, which I have found to be on the expensive side.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll give it a try!<br /><br />My favorite Korean restaurant in the neighborhood is Hae Woon Dae at 75-32 Broadway, but I like the one on 74th Street as well.<br />

				3 of us went for an early dinner.&nbsp; Nice looking inside even with all that fake looking wood. (Maybe it&#039;s real wood varnished to death.&nbsp; Nevertheless, attractive interior.&nbsp; Red stained floors, pale green bamboo style mats on the benches in the booths.&nbsp; Attractive serving dishes.&nbsp; Me likey.)&nbsp; &nbsp;So we ordered a ton of food:&nbsp; to start we shared edamame (I like more salt), chicken yakitori (very tender chicken, nice sweet sauce) and veggie tempura entree as an appetizer.&nbsp; Tempura was very good: sweet potatoes, yellow squash, eggplant etc.&nbsp; For entrees, my friends who don&#039;t like seafood (but were still game to come with me and check out the new place in town) had chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki.&nbsp; Both chicken and beef dishes were large portions and the meat was very tender and not fatty at all.&nbsp; Lots of sauteed onions,&nbsp; broccoli, rice.&nbsp; Tasty.&nbsp; They were both happy.&nbsp; I had salmon, tuna, yellowtail and shrimp sushi plus a Queens Blvd Roll which was king crab, avocado with spicy tuna and crunchy flakes.&nbsp; For dessert, ice cream tempura.&nbsp; 4 beers (Sapporo and Kirin are $3.00 each) plus a coke.&nbsp; Grand Total: $81.00&nbsp; SICK.&nbsp; We had left overs there was so much food.&nbsp; Boy, am I a happy little piggie.&nbsp; Oh and grand opening prices are $1.00 for sushi per piece.<br /><br />HURRAY!!!!!

				Got delievery tonight. Plenty of good sushi at $1 a piece. Rolls pretty good also. The salmon teriyaki was ok - fish a bit dry but tasty with veggies and rice.<br /><br />Pleasant staff and fast delivery.<br /><br />The bill was $45 - not bad.<br /><br />Will do this again.

				I had lunch here today. While the place is quite pleasing, I felt the food was just okay. We had the bento box for $7.75, which was a bargain. It came with miso soup/salad/california rolls/shumai and your choice of entrees. I had the chicken teriyaki. The shumai were fried and were a bit heavy on the dough, they were also quite fishy.(shrimp) The&nbsp; chicken was a little on the dry side. I did really like the ginger salad dressing. The people are quite nice and we were given green tea.

				Although I&#039;m glad we now have a reasonably-sized sit down Japanese restaurant in our neighborhood, I&#039;m pessimistic it is any better than its sister site on Queens Boulevard, which I only thought was ok.&nbsp; I plan to take advantage of their $1 sushi special tomorrow night, so we&#039;ll see.&nbsp; I&#039;m a sushi/sashimi snob and their takeout menu shows they have a limited variety of a la carte sushi.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been to their other location as well and while not as good as Yama on Houston St, I think it&#039;s perfectly fine. We went to the 37th Ave location two nights ago and had a very good meal. It was worth the long walk. We live very close to Happy Kitchen and I never go there anymore as the food is too bland, in my opinion.

				I went the other day <br />I don&#039;t really have any standards for the area, so I don&#039;t know what they are up against. <br /><br />for 1 dollar a piece, that is hard to beat.&nbsp; the sushi itself was less than special though. Everything was fresh I guess, but maybe the initial quality isnt as good as what I am used to. <br /><br />Can it matter that much to have non-japanese at the helm? The chefs were okay. They shiould really be more engaging though, it&#039;s supposed to be like a real bar, you know... <br /><br />Prices can&#039;t be beaten though. <br /><br />I told the chef to give me 8 pieces of whatever he wanted. he gave me salmon, tuna, white tuna, fluke, yellowtail. I was nonplussed. Only the white tuna was truly satisfying, and that&#039;s hard to mess up.&nbsp; Next time I will have to hold his hand to see what they can do.

				If you guys want some really amazing sushi not too far from home get on the 7 or walk to 52nd Street, Sunnyside and walk down to Skillman by 52nd street, TJ Asian Bistro is Awesome!!!!! I&#039;m not kidding, I go every single Friday night now, the owners and staff are so sweet, the place is very nice and upscale and the sushi is really incredible, try the Kimono Roll, you&#039;ll love it.

				My husband and I tried Tomo two nights ago and really enjoyed it.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t try any of the seafood due to an allergy, so I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki.&nbsp; The chicken was moist and flavorful and served on a bed of sauteed onions and shredded carrots and accompanied by a bowl of rice.&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; I also found the decor aesthetically pleasing and the staff was very friendly.&nbsp; Overall, a nice addition to the neighborhood.

				Hubby and I tried Tomo recently and it&#039;s ok sushi (a la carte).&nbsp; I may stick with the Americanized rolls next time since my expectation for those is lower.&nbsp; I like my sushi restaurants to be authentically Japanese and this isn&#039;t it.&nbsp; Not even counting the staff, the place is sooooo Chinese with its fish tank by the entry.&nbsp; Japanese restaurants don&#039;t do that.&nbsp; Funny that someone would mention Ariyoshi.&nbsp; I used to live around the block from that place.&nbsp; Even though it&#039;s five times more Japanese than this place, it&#039;s still not Japanese enough for me.&nbsp; Anyway, I don&#039;t mean to belittle this place.&nbsp; The decor is better than many restaurants around here and it fills a niche that was poorly lacking.&nbsp;

				Based on a tip on the JH Families listserv, my wife and I decided to try TJ Asian Bistro (http://www.tjsushi.com/) on Skillman and 52nd in Woodside.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak to &quot;authenticity,&quot; since I don&#039;t know what that means in this context.&nbsp; But TJ has among the best sushi I&#039;ve had in New York, and that includes more expensive places in Manhattan.&nbsp; Definitely worth a visit!&nbsp; (And make sure you try the Striped Bass, I&#039;ve never had it before and it was delicious!)<br /><br />That said, I also tried Tomo recently, and found it an excellent addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Delicious food and family friendly.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be going there regularly.

				about the authenticity thing-- <br /><br />My sister is temporarily living in JH and she recently went to Tomo.&nbsp; We lived in Japan for a few years as kids so we have a bit of extra knowledge about Japan and we also can pronounce Japanese words pretty well (but neither of us speaks Japanese).&nbsp; <br /><br />She told me that at Tomo she ordered the Age Tofu - which should be pronounced Ah-geh Tofu.&nbsp; She ordered it by calling it Ah-geh but had a bit of a funny miscommunication with the waitress or cashier, who said, &quot;you mean the Age tofu&quot; pronouncing it Age as in &quot;what age is your child&quot;.&nbsp; Anyway, after not understanding the question at first, finally my sister just backed down and said yes, I mean the Age tofu.<br /><br />and btw, she enjoyed the Age tofu but she wasn&#039;t impressed with the salmon sushi, which she said she felt was kind of tasteless.

				Tomo, not bad. Price is good, lots of good teriyaki box deals. The Miso Eggplant appetizer was perfect and not greasy.Love the peppered tuna salad. They do a creamy miso carrot salad dressing. For local it is good.

				I finally got to see/try Tomo.&nbsp; I just got take-out, did not sit down.&nbsp; I thought the salmon/avocado roll was quite nice, the yellowtail sushi fine, but the tuna sushi was not great - it seemed slimy.&nbsp; But that said, I am still really happy the place is there.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; The interior is pretty nice looking and I will definitely be back, at least for more salmon avocado rolls.

				Wife and I went to ToMo for lunch yesterday.&nbsp; She is not a lover of Japanese food but is always open to trying a new place, it turned out she really enjoyed the sashimi and the avocado roll and thought the decor was great.&nbsp; We&#039;re looking forward to a return trip soon.

				There is a new japenese place between 86th and 87th on 37th Road and it is good! I am not a big japenese food fan, but this place is great. The best is the lunch box - I got Tempura chicken and vegatables, and it comes iwth soup, slad, rice and those little dumpling things, for $7.95, I believe. Huge portions and the restaurant itself is very nice.

				It looks like there may be a new Japanese restaurant opening on Northern Blvd. near the corner of 48th Street.&nbsp; Geographically speaking, would that be considered Woodside?&nbsp; In any case, it&#039;s not too far from here.&nbsp; The restaurant front has a large &quot;opening soon&quot; banner advertising Kumo Sushi Bar at the location that was temporarily occupied by the Halloween costume shop on Northern.<br /><br />Anyone have more info on this to share?<br />

				Linn in Astoria is the most authentic Japanese I&#039;ve had in Queens.&nbsp; It has an interesting vibe in that it is also an art studio with movies projected onto a wall.&nbsp; Beyond the artsy stuff, the food is very good --I think the chef/owner worked at Masa--and very legit.&nbsp; The address is 29-13 Broadway.&nbsp; It&#039;s an area that is now home to a small, young Japanese population, mostly college students.&nbsp; There is a cute little Japanese food store right next door.
