					Picnicking isn&#039;t really the same thing as using gardens as a playground, though. I&#039;m not terribly old but I also don&#039;t care for the sound of children shrieking and yelling. I might just be sensitive because I work from home. That said, I can only think of a few instances in my short two-and-a-half years here where I&#039;ve heard children even come close to what I consider shrieking in my co-op garden. I lived for eight years in ground floor apartment directly across from a middle school, so I understand true noise.

					Because it was so cheap and is only one block from me I went ahead and joined Planet Fitness figuring it can&#039;t be worse than Blink, which actually raises my stress levels. On day #2 in business it was 100x better, but I suspect that&#039;s just because not everyone realizes it&#039;s open yet. I could actually use the weight machines, which I never can at Blink, though the downstairs area where they are located was fairly busy (and already male-dominated). The cardio equipment on the main floor was only about 10% occupied. I would say there is roughly the same amount of equipment and machines as at Blink but it seems like more because it’s spread over two floors. I have a feeling this easygoing atmosphere won&#039;t last long, as there was a line 20+ deep to sign-up around 4:30pm.

Maybe that&#039;s what they mean. In general the backsplash wall will need at least some patch repair when you pull off the counter.<br /><br />But it&#039;s so worth it. When you are on a budget, and looking at replacing a really hideous Formica, I really love wood. It&#039;s inexpensive and great looking. You just need to treat it with a wood oil. And if it&#039;s going over a dishwasher, apply foil backing to that spot.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Some of the cabinets are installed around the Formica so they would have to be removed and put back, assuming they don&#039;t get damaged in the process. The amount of Formica in my kitchen is sort of astounding, so replacing it will change the whole feel. <br /><br />The strange thing about butcher block counters is that they seem very popular on design blogs and I know they are sold inexpensively at Ikea, but the two contractors I&#039;ve met with seem to think wood is a specialty item and didn&#039;t seem crazy about working with it. I really dislike granite and quartz is pricier than what I&#039;m looking for right now. If I were doing stone at all, I would choose marble (which I&#039;ve been warned against).

					I&#039;m in a similar situation and am weighing whether I&#039;m going to do cosmetic upgrading or something more serious. I&#039;m having my cabinets painted (I have 38 doors and drawer faces in a kitchen of similar size to the one posted, so it&#039;s a bigger project than I feel like dealing with diy) and am changing the hardware myself. <br /><br />I would like to do a new countertop and backsplash too, but currently there is Formica covering nearly every surface of this kitchen and I was told it would be tricky, i.e. more expensive, to remove it all without destroying cabinets. <br /><br />I tried Sweeten recently with mixed results (only one contractor responded and he doesn&#039;t seem to get my aesthetics and wants to do way more than I would like). One thing to keep in mind with that service is that the minimum suggested budget is $10,000 and that&#039;s more like my absolute maximum, including new appliances. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious if anyone here has had success with contractors and smaller projects. This is more than a handyman job (I&#039;d also like to install a dishwasher where there has never been one). I&#039;ve reached out to some mentioned here on past threads and have had a hard time getting any responses.

I went to End of the Century Bar opening weekend and asked the bartender if they had considered Jackson Heights and he said the neighborhood was too Mexican (he was also Mexican and I&#039;m half, for what it&#039;s worth). Whether this is true or not, I do think there&#039;s a perception that nothing non-Latino could flourish here.

But it might be lower key on a weeknight.

					I have zero business sense or the funds, but the notion of starting a local bar with wider appeal has also crossed my mind. <br /><br />I like Ready Penny and Terazza 7 fine but there is not really anyplace in the neighborhood where a woman on her own could get a drink, or possibly socialize with friends, and not draw unwanted attention. (Despite many mentions, UFC and Espresso 77 just don&#039;t fit the bill.)<br /><br />I just chalk it up to neighborhood demographics--this is a very family-centric neighborhood where residents are mostly settled down or retired (which I&#039;m not). I recently escaped the extreme opposite (Williamsburg where everyone is under 28 and unencumbered) so that&#039;s not what I&#039;m calling for. It would just be nice to have a cocktail on a weeknight without having to hop on a subway.

					I&#039;ve only been here a few months, so I&#039;m still sussing out what I can and can&#039;t find in the neighborhood. I would say I leave for:<br /><br />Cheese<br />Cocktails. Bars with women in them beyond the staff.<br />Pizza<br />Middle Eastern food/ingredients<br />Haircuts<br />Movies<br />Clothing and shoes (though I buy 90% online anyway)<br />Medical services<br /><br />Er, I guess pretty much everything that doesn&#039;t involve Asian or Latino food or a drugstore or bank?

					I was initially excited to have a new, inexpensive gym nearby (despite reports of overcrowding) and assumed I’d be fine since I go during off-peak hours. Not so. I’ve never been to a gym before where no matter what time of day, nearly every weight machine is in use (and more often than not, being hogged by men, even though the clientele is pretty mixed gender). The last time I went at 3pm on a weekday, there wasn’t even a free treadmill –and there are a ton of treadmills. <br /><br />I live much closer to the supposedly horrible gym that used to be in the Blink space. I’m wondering if it’s really all that bad?<br />

					There&#039;s also a Don Alex on 95th and 37th, though it&#039;s not clear if the two were related. The website only mentions NJ branches, not a second Queens location. <a href="http://www.donalexrestaurant.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.donalexrestaurant.com/</a>
