				It&#039;s not an issue for me, at least not at the moment, but all buildings need to be in compliance of these laws. Hoping she wins her suit.<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-mom-sues-building-lack-wheelchair-access-article-1.2564066

				I live in the Southridge Complex and each unit has a wheelchair accessable ramp. While it is somewhat steep (not sure if ADA mandates a slope degree?) it&#039;s certainly there. The super lives in the complex and is outside at 6 am with each and every snow storm. I certainly wish the lady and her son the best but the notion that the bldg wasnt responsive is not accurate.<br /><br />Shame that as a society we have become such a sue happy culture where the only people who win are the lawyers.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The definition of compliance changes depending on when a building was built. Most of the buildings in Jackson Heights, having been built before these laws were in place, will only have to make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; for residents with disabilities. Sometimes, what&#039;s reasonable, especially with such a vague collection of laws determining accessibility, is best decided by courts.

				I&#039;d like to point out that there are four separate Southridge sections, and each one is owned &amp; run independent of the others. I&#039;m pleased to say the one I live in appears (to the best of my knowledge) to be wheelchair accessible. Automatic doors were just put in the rear entrance, and the passageway to the sidewalk seems fairly smooth. <br />Reading the Disabled Foodie&#039;s column have made me a bit more tuned in to how a small thing like a bump or high door saddle can be a big problem to someone in a wheelchair.

				I grew up in that building. The ramp is VERY steep. I&#039;m sure its not to ADA standards. I hope she wins.

				State and City law goes well beyond the ADA requirements.&nbsp; Slope is always an issue, and even if you&#039;re an old building, you typically must show that it is architecturally (e.g., making a walk-up accessible) or financially (e.g. if you are a small low income co-op) impossible to avoid compliance with city law.&nbsp; As it should be.

				I&#039;d love to hear from someone who is truly knowledgeable about such things. There&#039;s a lot of housing stock built pre-ADA (actually, most of it), and retrofitting many of the coops to become fully accessible would cost a pretty penny. Maybe even bankrupt them. And what does that mean anyway? I&#039;m doubtful any coop is required to make all doorways in the building accommodate a wheelchair, since I didn&#039;t see a single coop in my apartment hunt with doorways that wide. Or is it reasonable accommodation, which is a much lower bar than full compliance.
