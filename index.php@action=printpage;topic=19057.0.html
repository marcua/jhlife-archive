				FOR SALE BY OWNER<br /><br />I am interested in selling my one bedroom apartment at 77-12 35th Avenue, in the Berkeley Building.&nbsp; The apartment is about 925 square feet and has a full eat-in kitchen (which can also be turned into a flex room for a small extra bedroom or office), a spacious foyer, a large living room, a bathroom with a separate shower stall, and a large master bedroom with a lovely bay window.&nbsp; The apartment is in good condition, has plenty of storage, and wonderful neighbors.<br /><br />The Berkeley is one of the most sought after buildings in Jackson Heights, very close to the Roosevelt Avenue train station and 37th Avenue restaurants and shopping.&nbsp; Our building has a beautiful garden, storage units, laundry in the basement, and a bike storage room.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please contact me if you are interested in purchasing my apartment.&nbsp; Serious buyers only and no realtors please. <br /><br />Best,<br />Rachel

				An eat-in kitchen that can be turned into a bedroom? Hard to imagine what that would look like. I suggest you list on Streeteasy or another real estate site, then link to your fuller listing on JH Life. Include photos, layout, and a price, and include the maintenance fee for the apartment. There is not enough information here to prompt anyone to respond.

				Sounds like it&#039;s like the first listing linked to here--and the small dining area is what can be turned into an office or small second bedroom. I would think of that space as a dining area--it is separated from the kitchen-- and would think of the space the layout calls a dining room as the foyer. I had a layout like that in my former apartment, where we used the large foyer as an office space and the small, raised dining area as just that--though some people did make it into a baby&#039;s room. Nice apartments at the Berkeley.
