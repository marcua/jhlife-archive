				It seems like procuring food might be an issue. Any luck with good times to go to supermarkets, alternatives, delivery options?

				Shop on cold, rainy days.<br /><br />Delivery is a concern for seniors. Instacart workers may go on strike tomorrow.<br /><br />Foodtown offers online delivery: https://www.foodtown.com/shopping/#!/ (https://www.foodtown.com/shopping/#!/)<br />Fresh Direct: https://www.freshdirect.com/ (https://www.freshdirect.com/)<br /><br />A tip is to schedule your delivery for the morning if you can get a slot. The stores are cleaning and restocking at night, so your shopper is more likely to find the items you want first thing in the morning rather than at 4 pm for a 5 pm delivery.<br /><br />Expect to not be able to get delivery before 5-7 days. Build some flexibility in your choices. If you want to tofu and the store is out, have an alternative go to for protein (beans), because you are&#039;t getting the tofu.

				Has anyone used foodtown&#039;s online order with pick up option before? If so can you advise, does one need to stand in the line to collect their order or can you just speak to the door person to alert someone to bring the goods outside?<br /><br />Just a heads up, I filled an online cart on their website yesterday. At that time there were no slots for pick up or delivery available. I just rechecked and there were three pick up time slots for next Thursday so I pulled trigger. We shall see how that goes. They did have a pretty substantial &quot;provisional hold&quot; amount added on. Not sure what that money goes. They also stated that they will charge me for their reusable bags since plastic bags are now prohibited. Personally I wish they&#039;d just load up boxes they would recycle anyway and send me away with that.

				normally, &quot;provisional hold&quot; means a place adds extra in case they need to/want to change items for more expensive ones. it&#039;s usually removed as a charge after the fact. kinda like restaurants that require you to give a credit card number to guarantee a reservation.&nbsp; at least i hope that&#039;s the case here.

				Thank you dssjh. That&#039;s great news. They did have a pick up charge on there already too so hopefully I&#039;ll reclaim some of that cash. <br /><br />A general note: the cool thing about this Foodtown online ordering is if something you chose is not available, you can actually select if you want the item substituted or not and can prioritize replacement items by brand, size or price + a place to make a note. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing how well this whole thing works out.

				jh_foodie, I&#039;m using the 37th ave Foodtown. You can plug in the zip to check the foodtown store locator page to see if that Baxter store is still affiliated. When I look there it seems like it not. https://www.foodtown.com/my-store/store-locator#!/<br /><br />

Also, shout out to Mango Rico where I bought a ton of affordable produce a little earlier. Really well-versed and courteous with the social distancing.

				The Queensboro is doing something interesting - I got this email from them today:<br /><br />Dear friends and neighbors, we hope that you&#039;re healthy and also that if you&#039;re at home, you aren&#039;t going too stir-crazy.<br /><br />One of the more pedestrian challenges of this strange world we now live in is regular, plain shopping. Waiting in long lines, spotty supplies, limited hours, some stores that don&#039;t do an amazing job on social distancing...<br /><br />We here at the Q thought we might offer a small service to ease this burden. Q Care Packages are pre-packaged boxes of staples for your home kitchen. In normal times you might just pop out to the store for a gallon of milk or some eggs, but these are not normal times. The Q Care Package isn’t meant to replace your grocery store trip, but we hope it will give some of you a convenient option to space those trips out a little more.<br />&nbsp;<br />A quick technical note: Our online ordering system is a little limited, so it doesn&#039;t let us schedule orders in advance the way we need this to work, so it will look as if you&#039;re ordering for right now, but please ignore that and come pick up on Tuesday between 12-2PM.<br /><br />So how does it work? We assemble a box of staples - milk, eggs, butter, flour, juice, leafy greens, fruit and some value-added extras from The Q (this week granola!). Order in advance, pay online and then show up during the designated window to pick up. Your box will be waiting with your name on it - just grab and go.<br /><br />This is a pilot program, so depending on the response and any feedback from you, we will be determining the frequency, size and variety in the boxes. For the first day it is a one size fits all for $50.<br />&nbsp;<br />Order by 5pm on Monday and pick up between noon and 2pm on Tuesday.<br />&nbsp;<br />(Please ignore that it looks as if you&#039;re ordering for right now, this is for Tuesday!)<br /><br />This week’s box includes:<br />&nbsp;<br />Milk, butter, eggs, ground coffee, yogurt, bacon, potatoes, onions, leafy greens, fruit, granola and some TOILET PAPER.<br />&nbsp;<br />No more hoarding, folks!

				I went to Food Town this morning during the designated senior hours. The line to pay snaked around the store all the way to the frozen food aisle: I&#039;d guess it would have taken 45 minutes to get to the cashier. I walked out in frustration and found that Lemon Farm has just reopened. I got almost everything I needed there, with a quick stop also at Mango Rico. Both shops had masked and friendly cashiers.

				Just heard about Pepper Pantry, which has several delivery options for 11372 -- for example, Manhattan Fruit Exchange, free delivery by 9 pm same day, minimum $75 and Aqua Best, seafood delivery on selected date, minimum $60.<br /><br />Shop Pepper Pantry (https://shop.usepepper.com/pages/greater-nyc-area-nyc-nj-ct?fbclid=IwAR0Fg3PILKS1HF2eokZ4GtzIMU88MNkjhZKIMM3G6j9Wt3C3N0X9SleEmjU)<br /><br />Here&#039;s an article about them: Pepper Groceries Pivots to Help B2B Food Suppliers Sell Direct to Consumer (https://thespoon.tech/pepper-groceries-pivots-to-help-b2b-food-suppliers-sell-direct-to-consumer/?fbclid=IwAR39F9_EPEs_BpA3y7hLDUpwPdRHNT9diekG43W9peG540i7diyl8zGXmBo)<br /><br />article:<br />There are two consistent stories that we are seeing unfold during this time of global pandemic and massive restaurant closings. First is that the traditional ways of the restaurant business are gone for now and any company that wants to survive in that space needs to pivot into something new. The second is that all the food that would have been used by those now shuttered restaurants needs somewhere to go.<br /><br />Pepper sits right in the middle of that venn diagram. A few months ago it was a startup that helped restaurants streamline their food buying from multiple suppliers. With restaurants closing, Pepper’s original business plan was kind of shot. But because Pepper was working with food suppliers, it knew even though so many restaurants slowing down or ceasing operations, those suppliers still had food to sell. So Pepper did what any smart startup does in challenging times: it pivoted.<br /><br />It quickly transformed its platform from business-to-business to direct-to-consumers. Pepper’s first market is the greater New York City area, and people in the five boroughs there can visit PepperGroceries.com to purchase seafood, produce, meat, cheese and even kitchen and janitorial supplies from the companies that used to supply restaurants.<br /><br />Each of these suppliers has their own delivery trucks, and orders are turned around in a couple of days. Pepper currently works with four suppliers and is in talks to bring on more. For now, all the money a shopper spends on Pepper goes directly to the suppliers.<br /><br />“All the proceeds are going to pockets of the suppliers,” Bowie Cheung, Co-Founder and CEO of Pepper told me by phone this week. “The general thing is to see how much relief we can provide to these [suppliers]. Drum up as much demand as we can.”<br /><br />Cheung said that while the service is only available in the New York/New Jersey area right now, the platform can easily scale up and go nationwide. Pepper is venture-backed with an undisclosed seed round investment from Greylock Partners and Box Group.<br /><br />Like so many things being upended by the coronavirus right now, one has to wonder whether this will be a temporary pivot for Pepper or a new normal both for the startup and the food suppliers it works with. As Cheung summed it up, “How and where does the industry go in a couple of months? I have no idea.”<br />

				Anybody know whether Downtown Natural Market ever re-opened?&nbsp; If so, how bad is the line to get in. Be nice to get some stuff from there.

				Not sure if it’s been mentioned yet, but Food Universe over by the Cannelle Patisserie strip mall is a good option for basic groceries. I don’t shop there regularly, but stopped by early this morning, approx 7:30 AM. There was only one person on line, so the attendant let us in. While inside, I noticed that the small amount of people shopping were varied in age. BTW, the store was pretty well stocked. Another plus is that the market is next door to Cannelle, and yes, it was open. I didn’t go in, but there was a line of about 7-8 people waiting to enter.

				Anyone know if Despana open? <br />I went there twice in March, both time they display new opening hours. The front door is locked but when knock on the door they will allow you in.<br />I went again two weeks ago but closed with no notice. I even call the number on the door but no one pick up.

				I don&#039;t know if anyone has the ear of the manager over at Foodtown, but they have lost so much business from me over the past 6 weeks because of the long lines to get into their store. One Saturday I waited in line for 30 minutes without moving one spot forward, so I walked that day to Food Universe instead. Today, Food Dynasty got $60 of my business when I saw another line going around the corner and halfway up the block at Foodtown. I was in and out of Food Dynasty before I would&#039;ve gotten my foot in the door across the avenue. It&#039;s a shame, because Foodtown was always my go-to supermarket since I moved into Jackson Heights.

				I was there about 10.30, no line to get in. I guess it depends on the time of day. Same at Key Food across the street and Trade Fair at 90th. Downtown Market no line (around noon) but had to wait a couple of minutes for someone to open the door. Didn&#039;t even try for Patel!

				Steven, I was at Food Town this morning at 7:05 and there was no line.&nbsp; I went inside and noticed very few customers. No line at the deli.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I was ready to check out, no line.&nbsp; It was an incredible food shopping experience.&nbsp; Yes, 7:05 is very early in the morning to be food shopping but its worth not having to wait on line.&nbsp; The down side is that the bread had not been delivered which I didn&#039;t need and the fish department was not open also not a problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I have not been able to get into Patel Bro’s on 74th, but it was easy to visit the veg/supermarket on 73rd St &amp; 37th Ave (SUBZI) <br />The Indian yogurt is terrific and a very good price, and they also sell long green squash (cuzzuzza)
