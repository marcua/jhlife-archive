				Hi all!<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if this is a known fact or even anything cool to look at, but while walking to the 7 train to head to school I noticed something near THIS building:<br /><br />http://x.lnimg.com/photo/poster_1920/0f11e40ce0d44eb88b377730deddc785.jpg<br /><br />This store (formerly KB Toys, now it looks like someone threw white paint on it), has some interesting history and fun facts to it that I gathered and felt like it&#039;d be cool to share! :)<br /><br />So, I found out on another forum from 5 years ago on this forum (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=64.180) that there was a store called Clark&#039;s back in the 60s and 70s that sold women&#039;s clothing. Then I found this picture - https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/06/80/6b/06806b294b3997cd89da8cc59e5779d1.jpg<br /><br />I guess those weird oval rings aren&#039;t there for nothing! What I noticed when walking by the building was that the original store&#039;s insignia &quot;CLARK&#039;S&quot; is in the concrete in front of the store. Always asked myself what the hell was there. Is the store thats there now related to the original store or something? It seems like a women&#039;s clothing store judging by the clothing display outside but I never bothered to go inside because I&#039;m not purchasing anything.... and I&#039;m not a woman... so yea. Cool history I guess!<br /><br />Anyone have any pics of the neighborhood from the 70s and 80s? Would have loved to grow up back then! <br /><br />Thanks for reading! I hope this post didn&#039;t seem messy! :P<br />

				Back in the 50&#039;s and before Clark&#039;s was a very fancy store. I once held the door open for Mrs. Louis Armstrong. Yep. I was wowed that she would shop in JH! But then, they only lived about 20 blocks away.
