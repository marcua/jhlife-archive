				My boyfriend and I have been struggling to find out the answer to this question as well. Juju on 76th seems to have decent bagels but I think the best ones are at Brooklyn Bagel (the closest one being on 35th and Broadway).

				Not great, but decent is the JH bagel shop at 86th and 37th Ave.&nbsp; They are not consistent, but I often enjoy the bagels there.&nbsp; I am not a fan of Brooklyn Bagels and its hard finding a great bagel.&nbsp; Absolute Bagels on the UWS are great.&nbsp; I like Murray&#039;s Bagels in Chelsea, but they don&#039;t toast them.&nbsp; Want to explore some better bagel options in Queens--I heard there are great bagels out by Utopia Parkway...

				JH Bagels on 37th and 86th and Juju&#039;s on 76th and 37th are probably the closest things you can call to being a bagel in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; When I want good bagels, I go out to Bagels &amp; Brew on B-Way and 43rd Street.&nbsp; Nice shop, owner operated, their Whole Wheat Everything Bagel cannot be beat and their sundried tomato cream cheese is fantastic.

				It might be a hike for you, but the Bagel House at 89th &amp; Northern does a decent job.

				Bagel House is my favorite in Jackson Heights. Out of the neighborhood, I&#039;m a fan of Lot&#039;s Bagels in Astoria, but I&#039;m also not willing to travel too far for bagels... Bagel House has good, hand rolled, boiled bagels.

				Place on 86th and 37th is mediocre but probably the best option.&nbsp; Just threw out bagels from jujus, they were so unecessarily salty.&nbsp; Jujus bagels are par baked, as in they get them frozen, like dunkin donuts.&nbsp; Id prefer dunkin over jujus.&nbsp; Anyone know someone who wants to open a bagel place in the hood??

				JuJu&#039;s hands down. Sami and his family are a great presence in the hood and he has good bagels. I also fancy both the low and high fat tuna, he makes a mean tuna.

				I agree Juju&#039;s is very good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, they&#039;re not baked in-house, but they are dense and chewy, with a firm crust, like good bagels should be.&nbsp; And their pumpernickel tastes like pumpernickel.&nbsp; Even in Manhattan, it&#039;s getting harder and harder to find good quality bagels, so I&#039;m grateful to have Juju&#039;s here.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I agree with hfm, the family that owns the shop is delightful and have created a wonderful addition to the community.

				i actually really like both Slims (on 86th and 37th Ave) and Jujus bagels.&nbsp; The guys at Slims are super friendly as well, and I&#039;m always happy to see them smiling when we go there. I do like bigger fatter bagels, which Slims has usually, but Juju&#039;s multgrain are just so tasty. I might be against the crowd saying I think Brooklyn Bagels are just grossly and unnecessarily huge.&nbsp; I am very happy with the JH bagel scene, and yes, i am a new yorker, so a self-proclaimed bagel expert :)

				I live off 34th and 87th so usually go the bagel store on Northern and 87th Street corner.&nbsp; Have no idea what bagel store people are talking about on 86th and Northern unless they just got the block wrong.&nbsp; I think the bagels are better though at the Northern/89th Street bagel store but since neither one is like Murray&#039;s or H&amp;H in the City, it&#039;s not worth the two extra blocks.&nbsp; A toasted sesame at 87th Street is just fine enough for me.<br />
