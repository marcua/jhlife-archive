				I lived in Jackson Heights from 3rd grade at PS 69, Joseph Pulitzer JHS 145 and onto Bryant for 2 years before I moved to Long Island with my father. If I am remembering correctly, I left sometime in 1966. I have so many great memories from living in Jackson Heights and remember having a great circle of friends through the years. I missed them terribly after I had left.<br /><br />Here are some of the things that I remember: Toy City on 37th Ave., PS 69, Mrs Levi who flunked me in 3rd grade....who does that to a new kid coming in mid term, geez, and my favorite teacher Eli Jacobowitz who inspired me in 5th grade, candy store right across the street from PS 69, pizza store close to school (slice for .15), Hamburger Express which was my favorite (with Al cooking the hamburgers at lunchtime), Toddle House, Fish store on Roosevelt Ave that sold the best french fries that I have ever had in my entire life, Tito Puente sign in the window of a place on 37th Ave, Jahn&#039;s where my mother and I would eat dinner after her work, JHS 145, St Joan of Arc school where some of my friends went, Record store on 82nd street where I bought my first Beatles record, Fields department store, Jackson theater, Boulevard theater where I saw the Beatles movies and James Bond movies with my favorite guy back then, Vladimir Zea, and the 77th street park where I spent a lot of my time playing handball or just meeting up with friends from all around.<br /><br />Does anyone remember any of those things? Is there anyone in this community that was in Jackson Heights during the 60&#039;s that remembers going to the park on 77th street, playing handball...or just meeting friends there? It was a wonderful time. Would love to hear from someone from back then who remembers any of this.<br /><br />I could probably list a lot more but maybe someone could list what they remember which would stir some other memories from back then. They were all good times and good memories.

				Hi Lynn,<br /><br />I&#039;m not a long-timer of JH (been here less than 10 years) but thought I would find you a couple of threads to read where people were discussing some of their memories.&nbsp; Welcome to the board and feel free to browse around!<br /><br />Any long time Jackson Heights residents out there? (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=64.0)<br /><br />Anybody from 34-58 90 street jackson Heights in the 1950- 1960 era (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=12523.0)<br /><br />Toddle House (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=3124.0)

				Loved the Toddle House.&nbsp; Also the pizza place; two slices and a coke for forty cents.&nbsp; Most of all, the fries at the fish store were the best I ever had.&nbsp; Those were the days!

				I lived on 76th and 34th ave and the baseball diamond was right outside my window. I was in Mr Hartsteins class in 1964, PS 69 and used to go to the Pizza Place and Hamburger Express all the time. That park used to have sprinklers where I went as a small child. The monkey bars up the ramp and see saw too. The handball court below wasn&#039;t something I was into. Don&#039;t know if you knew that in the warm months they would have a band on occasion playing on the base ball field at night. So many friends that I can&#039;t locate. I moved to L.I. in 1965.<br />Vicki Unger

				Morris twins - No mention of Budd&#039;s on 37th Avenue?&nbsp; Attracted kids from all over Queens. Summertime you&#039;d run into beach goers from Rockaway who came to Budd&#039;s after a day at the beach.&nbsp; Now that&#039;s a popular watering hole.

				I lived at 75th Street &amp; 35th Avenue from the mid 50&#039;s until 1972, a year after i got out of the service.<br /><br />Do you remember Molly&#039;s candy store at 75th Street &amp; 37th Avenue I worked there at 13 doing the Sunday papers.<br /><br />When I turned 16 I went to work for Bohack a few stores down.

				Yes, I remember a LOT. We lived here on 89th st from 1948-51 and my father was the local Doctor, office in Woodside, surgeon in Physicians Hospital and almost all the other (now gone) Queens hospitals. I went to Garden School for 5th grade and PS 89 for 6th (horrible teacher) and 7th (fabulous teacher, Mr. O&#039;Neill). He probably was the greatest influence that led me into teaching. I subsequently taught university, secondary and primary school Movement in the UK and this country.<br /><br />We all played punchball in the street near our homes, hung out in vacant lots (remember those?), walked the neighbors&#039; dogs and went to some Carnival each Spring down by Northern Blvd (ferris wheel and lots of rides). All were a dime each ride, if I recall correctly. <br /><br />I have just moved back and would love to meet other long-ago residents.<br />Yes: Fields&#039; dept store (small by today&#039;s standards but very posh to my immigrant family&#039;s mind). Jahn&#039;s was in Forest Hills, not here, in my day but everyone had their local corner candy store and ice cream counter. Near PS 89 was Hampton&#039;s, where they let us read the comic books for free providing we put them back nicely, while we had lunch at the counter.<br /><br />We had BMT (now N,R) and IND (now E/F) and it wasn&#039;t the 32 bus but it Was the 15 double-decker bus that went from Manhattan to JH. We took it home a lot from my dancing lessons. I became a dancer and graduated from HS Performing Arts in 1956!<br /><br />I have recently dissolved my animal rescue organization but am always interested in meeting like-minded people with animal concerns, or interests in the Healing Arts. I am a certified yoga, Pilates instructor and a Yoga Therapist. I hope to meet new friends here, now that I am finally (more or less) moved in.

				I lived at 34-41 77th Street from the late summer of 1950 until I left for the Army in &#039;65. I moved back, briefly, while I served. My first wife lived there with my mother while I was overseas.<br /><br />The park was just down the street and I played handball and used the playground equipment there and also the shallow pool with the spray when it was hot. I went to some of the live music events and rode through one of them with the guys from the Black Rebel M//C club, with whom I hung out when I took a year off from school at 15.<br /><br />I was watching TV one night in the &#039;70s and saw the surveilence film of a shooting on my block. The vehicle, driven by a Columbian drug dealer, came to rest against the back-stop of the ballfield. I called my mom and asked her why I had to learn that there were drug dealers living across the street from my old apartment building.<br /><br />Reading this site for the last several hours has brought back a lot of memories. I went to PS 69, JHS 145 and then Bryant where I was in the Honors Program. When it turned out that we still had 40 kids in class, not enough desks and not enough books, I got my shrink to get me out.<br /><br />I went to McBurney School, a boy&#039;s school run by the YMCA in Manhatten. I dropped out and ended up finishing at Rhodes School. I graduated, with honors, in &#039;63.<br /><br />I hung out at Moss Rexal Drugs on 37th Ave. where some of us attended Sunday Moss, having breakfast with the other kids playing hooky from church. Around noon, when Jahn&#039;s opened, we moved our base there.<br /><br />I was a regular at Bud&#039;s on 37th Ave. from before I could legally drink - NY was an 18 to drink state at that time. Since I was a regular, I could get in on weekends, even when there were lines. And, we could bring girls from the line in with us, making us popular.<br /><br />I have a lot of fond memories of The Heights. If anyone is interested, I will share them.

				I was born in Physicians hospital in 1950, lived on 84th Street and Roosevelt Ave till we moved to Bayside in 1969.&nbsp; Went to Garden School from 1955 to 1967, and we spent a lot of time in the park across 78th Street!&nbsp; Spent a lot of recesses there and remember being a crossing guard in 5th and 6th grade, and having the crossing from Garden as my post.&nbsp; Do they still allow kids to climb on Monkey Bars over asphalt? Remember in High School that&nbsp; Garden Varsity Home Soft Ball games we’re held in the Park. Also remember taking Driver’s Ed and starting and ending driving sessions at the park.&nbsp; Anyone remember Nick’s Coffee Shop on the north side of Northern Blvd?&nbsp; A long time ago!!

				LOL I have no idea who you, Lynne Brophy are but we have the exact opposite tastes/memories concerning the teachers you named. I had Mrs. Levy in the 4th Grade (I think it was 1961) and she was one of the nicest, kindest teachers I ever had. I had Mr. Jacobowitz&nbsp; who changed his name to Javits in the beginning of the 5th grade and he was one of the nastiest most miserable vile people I have ever had the misfortune to know. I had forgotten about him till now- thanks for reminding me of a truly evil human being I had forgotten about for over 50 years! Luckily after a few months they transferred part of the class including me to Mrs. Millstein&#039;s class. who was so-so. Jacobowirz was such a nasty work of art he tried to get a kid transferred out of the school (I don&#039;t remember if he did) because he lived a few blocks out of the district. The rest of your memories I share good thoughts on but that fish store that sold French Fries was not open that long or kids were forbidden to buy French Fries their or something- Maybe my nutso mother whose still living forbade me to go there in one of her insane actions. I have memories of being insane myself of going to the 78 street park in the middle of a freezing winter with ice on the ground &amp; playing basketball on the courts when I was 14 a few times.<br /><br />
