			A member with the name Kelso444 posted back a few years ago a question asking if anyone knew of a JH Bartender of the 50&#039;s &amp; 60&#039;s by the name of Billy Brennan. Here&#039;s my reply: I knew Billy Brennan very well if you are referring to the BB that came from a great Irish family located on the north side of Northern Bvd in the low eighties or high seventies. I&#039;d been to his hours once or twice but can&#039;t remember the street. I was friends with him though our high school years and totally lost track after I went into the service in &#039;52. I heard something vague about him moving to Texas but have never confirmed that. If you have any update on him since 1952, I&#039;d love to hear about it. I&#039;m going on 86 so Billy has to be around that age, if he&#039;d still living. Contact me on my email address: greatpoobah@aol.com&nbsp; Be sure to put Billy Brennan in the subject box. My Name is Howard Giordano<br />

Here&#039;s my reply: <br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />Howard, did you send your message directly to Kelso444&#039;s email inbox? If not, then go back to Kelso&#039;s post and click on Kelso&#039;s name at the top of the post, which will take you to the poster&#039;s cover page. To the left under the name, you will see in blue font &quot;Send PM&quot;. Open that, type in the subject, and type or paste your message in the text box &gt; hit &quot;send&quot;. <br /><br />Hope you get a response.<br /><br />~Jeanette

			Jeanette<br />Thanks for your response. I did send the msg to his email address, but after reading your note, I sent it again as a PM. If Kelso444 is still active on this site, he should get one or the other. Thanks again.
