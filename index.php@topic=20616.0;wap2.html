			there&#039;s signage up outside the old medical supply store at Roosevelt and 75th, and it&#039;s going to be a restaurant called Gury&#039;s (or maybe Gary&#039;s -- it&#039;s written in script). looks like it could be nice and it&#039;s definitely quite large. they&#039;ve installed porthole windows and replaced or cleaned the brickwork. could be close to opening.

That place was an eyesore. Almost anything well maintained will be an improvement.

			I literally came back on here after like two years of dormancy to find out the 411 on this place, having just noticed the new facade today. Having a second kid does terrible things to your priorities. Hahaha.
