					^The ACRIS database has property records. You can keep tabs on how much all your neighbors paid for their homes. <br />&nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Best way is to look up the BBL# (Borough, Block, Lot) of the buildings. I don&#039;t remember how to do it, but we used this database extensively when looking to buy and we were narrowing in on which apartments and buildings we liked enough to consider an offer on. It was really helpful to have some actual data to work from.<br /><br /><a href="https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/CP/</a><br /><br />I don&#039;t know if realtors have better databases to get the same info, but they may have more time/resources to target the buildings along 34th Avenue and then compare them to sales off 34th to see if what I think has been a bit of a price decline since the pandemic began. I know one or two units closed in my building last summer at prices that suggested they went in to contract before the Covid shutdown, and since then there&#039;s been a price slump.

There have been many, many opportunities for people to share their concerns and hopes for the space with DoT. There have been visioning sessions, in-person meetings with residents along 34th Avenue, community board meetings, etc. DoT has said they are planning multi-lingual meetings as well. The groups that want to keep it 12 hours a day/7 days a week, as well as the groups calling for permanent design changes to the space that could potentially eliminate the need for barricades, are all advocating for their position. The group that is calling for a reduction in length and hours is hardly unheard. <em><strong>There is a conversation happening right now.</strong></em><br /><br />The redesign DoT is presenting isn&#039;t going to be the final design. Like you say, other spaces have had continual tweaks, and I don&#039;t know why anyone would assume 34th Ave OS would not also have continual tweaks until it reaches its final form, whatever and whenever that is.

					There&#039;s been a solid year of OS now, with apartments going on the market post shutdown for at least six months. I&#039;d rather hear from an actual real estate agent with the time/resources to crunch the data -- since after all, coop sales are public information -- on the subject of property values on 34th Avenue compared to property values elsewhere.

					my hunch is that if/when we reach herd immunity, a lot of restaurants will ditch the outdoor set ups. They seem like they are expensive, have to be maintained, and need to be changed for weather (the ones that still have up the plastic paneling on all four sides might be better suited for a sweat lodge at this point in the year), which may not be worth the expense and hassle if the extra seating doesn&#039;t generate enough income.<br /><br />In the meantime, I surely wish the city would make the restaurants either maintain their outdoor set up or get rid of it all together.

					My guess is it&#039;s either a vinyl laminate or engineered hardwood (really, a different kind of laminate.) My understanding of parquet floors is that it&#039;s thin, so my guess would be the current owners decided it was better to just float another floor on top of it. (they might have ripped it out though) If you want to rip everything up and add a hard wood floor, I think you&#039;re going to need the space for a subfloor, which may not be there. <br /><br />From the photos, it looks fine and in good condition. I probably wouldn&#039;t bother replacing what already looks pretty decent considering the cost and hassle of replacing floors. You&#039;ll likely be putting down rugs anyway, if only to dampen sound within the apartment and add some softness (if they floated a floor, there&#039;s probably already an underlayment there that meetings the coop&#039;s floor covering rules), so my guess is unless it&#039;s really awful, you won&#039;t even notice the floor all that much if you buy and move in.

From watching the most vocal ones online, it largely seems like they have the impression that if they don&#039;t get what they want, they have not been listened to. <br /><br />

					^realistically, a contractor will find the job a lot more attractive to take on if there are multiple things for them to do. Especially if it&#039;s a successful contractor with a lot of work. <br /><br />The real estate agent you work with should be able to give you a general idea. <br /><br />When I was looking, after talking with our&nbsp; realtor, I was pretty clear based on our budget and how much money we would need to have in the bank once we closed to pass most of the coop boards&#039; requirements (and our own comfort level) that while we couldn&#039;t afford redoing a whole kitchen and bath before moving we, we could swing putting in a new floor and some electric work. We ended up with an apartment with a pink tiled bathroom, and a largely mostly 1950s kitchen that was functionally adequate and we could live with for a few years while we saved up for a renovation.

					^^I am sorry you are going through that. Children make noise, and if someone doesn&#039;t want to hear the normal sounds of children, they should go buy a house in the middle of nowhere with the nearest neighbors being a mile away. (And that being said, people out in the country figure out ways to be loud and annoy their neighbors. I knew people whose neighbors let their teenagers run their ATVs up and down the hills all hours of the night.).<br /><br />I hope you&#039;ll reconsider moving. Eventually your cranky neighbor will stop and your kid will get bigger and stop being so loud (but kids are loud sometimes), and if you have to go to the coop board and management company and explain that you are being harassed to get him or her to do so, I hope you&#039;ll do it (document all the nonsense - dates/times, description). There are things of course you can do to make sure your kid isn&#039;t exceptionally loud - put down carpet, use those spongy tile things in the play area, every body wear slippers in the house (that might be a big ask for a toddler, I realize), take your kid out to a playground every day to burn energy, do your best to not let them run all over until after 8 am. <br /><br />Given the level of escalation (and Covid), it might be hard to do, but you might consider asking your neighbor to take a walk/coffee with you to discuss as kindly as possibly how you can both live near each other peaceably.<br /><br />Good luck!

					I&#039;m in a pet friendly coop, and our House Rules mostly cover dogs, but I know we have owners with cats and parrots. The rules are basically what you would expect - your dog can&#039;t be left to bark all day long, keep the dog on a leash at all times, don&#039;t let the dog in the landscaping (our board is particularly nasty and fined a shareholder who distractedly didn&#039;t notice that her tiny little dog peed on a fence rather than just sending a notice to remind the shareholder of the rule), owner is financially responsible for any damage your pet causes the coop, etc. We are expected to register pets iand have an emergency contact on file and dogs have to be up on their vaccinations.<br /><br />I heard there was talk maybe a decade ago about going pet-free, but people who buy in to a pet-friendly coop would be more likely to want the option of getting a pet in the future even if they don&#039;t currently have one, and I think making that change (which I guess is just a house rule) would probably lead to board members who voted in favor of changing the rules being voted out.

					My SO and I will be fully vaccinated in a few weeks, were just talking about how once we were indoor dining would no longer be scary to us - though we will consider to cast a side eye at every business that built Covid sheds - so the timing on this looks promising. I&#039;d love to have a place in the neighborhood where we can get a pint with some food that goes well with beer. (South Asian and beer is a good pairing, but most of those restaurants either don&#039;t serve alcohol or serve by the bottle, I think)
