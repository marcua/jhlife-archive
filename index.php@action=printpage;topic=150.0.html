				Have you ever picked up used furniture from the street that has been discarded as trash?&nbsp; It is a great way to get used furniture for free. I picked up a computer table, wooden cart, wooden chairs, wooden table, and drawer.&nbsp; I use Lysol disinfectant spray to clean them first.

				Be aware that this neighborhood has a bed bug problem. Lysol won&#039;t kill them. <br />Free furniture probably isn&#039;t worth the risk.

				I don&#039;t pick up mattresses or sofas or anything like that.&nbsp; I only pick up hard wood tables, or metallic carts.&nbsp; I am using a metallic cart as a shoe rack.

				Just to clarify, this CITY has a huge problem with them.<br />In regards to what type of furniture you pick up:<br />They can hide anywhere a business card can fit, so<br />you won&#039;t necessarily see them. And they can be <br />on any type furniture.

				Actually, every major city and many smaller cities are now having problems with them as well.&nbsp; Add to that some dormitories at colleges, hotels, public schools, nursing homes, etc.&nbsp; In NYC I believe there has not been a major education campaign because of the issue of the number of tourist dollars potentially being lost if people think they will have to deal with them if they visit here.<br /><br />But one of the top things that should be in an education campaign (if there ever is one) would be not to trash-pick furniture.&nbsp; Those days are over, at least until a better pesticide can be found.&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s still possible to pick things from the trash and not get bedbugs, but I agree with cybgrand - it isn&#039;t worth the risk to you or to your neighbors.

				Bedbugs hide in all types of furniture, not just beds, so I too would avoid picking up any furniture off the street no matter how nice it is.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sad state of things, but oh so true and a problem that is best avoided.

				My friend had a new mattress delivered from Sleepys that was infested with bed bugs when it arrived. They refused to admit it, but I bet it&#039;s from them taking away old mattresses in the same truck they deliver new ones.

				Here is a link to a series of articles from the New York Times on them:<br />http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/bedbugs/index.html?8qa<br />Under the multi-media section you will see an interactive map of complaints in NYC.<br />Our area has a high concentration of complaints.<br />
