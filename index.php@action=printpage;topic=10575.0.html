				I&#039;m a little baffled by the lemon farm on the corner of 78th and 37th ave. I have been frequenting this corner spot because of the appeal of the produce out front and the clean store inside. As of recent or maybe because I have been anal at looking at labels etc but I have been noticing expired and moldy products. How do we know that the produce is organic?<br /><br />I&#039;ve asked many employees where they get there produce from, answers varied from around the world ha...I asked them directly if it is grown locally and most answered no. <br /><br />This leads to my next question, other then the farmers market on Sundays does Jackson Heights have a CSA ( community supported agriculture) program in place? I did some preliminary research and couldn&#039;t find any info, I know forest hills, lic, Glendale have them..<br /><br />Thanks

				I typically buy at the Growing Farm (?) one block down; on average they have cheaper and better quality produce. I always get the names confused...Lemon Tree and Growing Farm? The Lemon tree is great for fancy canned goods, cheese, bulk coffee, dried fruit/nuts, etc. They seem to have the biggest selection of &quot;gourmet&quot; products in the neighborhood. My grocery routine is Lemon Tree for speciality items, Growing Farm for produce and Met food for everything else.

				I like the selection of products Lemon Farm has, but I have also noticed out of date products hanging around for long stretches. I don&#039;t want to accuse anyone of anything, but I find it hard to believe with that small of a store and the number different people I see running it that it goes unnoticed (few different cashiers, couple guys looking like owners and a few other workers, that&#039;s a lot of eyes for a two aisle store). I would imagine it&#039;s not a high profit venture. Strange for sure. Just check the packaging when you&#039;re buying.

				Just a heads-up about some good new products they&#039;re carrying: Justin&#039;s Peanut Butter Cups, Prosciutto di Parma, Eli&#039;s Hot Dog Rolls, Newman&#039;s Own Baked Goods, an expanded line of Rustic Bakery crackers, and Eleni&#039;s cookies.

				i like lemon farm a lot, but i&#039;ve had three separate instances of bringing home cheese/meat that was well past -- like four weeks -- the sell-by date. i know i should check, and they&#039;ve been apologetic and willing to replace each time, but the pattern is a little bit disturbing at this point.

I even posted about it in this thread then forgot. Bought some rather far out of date cheese, and it was too far past and tasted a little sour (was the mozz in water in a bag). You definitely have to be sharp checking the dates.<br /><br />I still find it hard to believe with the number of people working there they can&#039;t check dates, it has to be purposeful trying not to lose money on spoiled stock, either that or gross negligence. Both are a serious red flag. <br /><br />They have great products it&#039;s a shame, they need to do something about it. Way too many workers for such a small store there&#039;s no way they don&#039;t have time for it. I&#039;ve seen the owner just standing around outside many times. GO CHECK YOUR PRODUCT DATES. I&#039;m assuming you are purposefully selling out of date product.

				After buying expired things too many times at Trade Fair (which I never go to anymore!) I ALWAYS check dates, even when I&#039;m at Stop &amp; Shop. I guess Lemon Farm doesn&#039;t have too high turnover on some of their products? This weekend I was looking at the boxes of nuts &amp; dried fruit in the front of the store and some of the containers were covered in dust.

				lack of turnover can explain away a few days or a week past expiration date. but three, four, five weeks past? that&#039;s intentional.
