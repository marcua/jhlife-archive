						<span class="smalltext">&#171;&nbsp;<strong>on:</strong> September 09, 2010, 06:37:49 AM&nbsp;&#187;</span>

					<br />&nbsp;<br />Good news! The very much awaited art classes are here! <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Background:<br />&nbsp;<br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (The Jewish Center) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Philosophy and curriculum:<br />&nbsp; <br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Classes will start in October.&nbsp; They will run parallel to the public school schedule. Additional classes may be offered during the holidays while the kidâ€™s ore out of school.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Classes will run Mon-Thursday. Length of classes: 1 hour&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. After School: 2 classes each afternoon: 3:15-4:15, or 4:30-5:30. Classes are divided into ages:&nbsp; 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 <br />&nbsp;2. Morning Toddlers (with parents or nannies), ages 3-4: 10:00AM-11:00AM, 11:15AM to 12:15AM. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Subjects to explore throughout the year: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. Techniques in drawings <br />&nbsp;2. Painting techniques <br />&nbsp;3. Sumi drawing <br />&nbsp;4. Collage techniques <br />&nbsp;5. Sculpture and 3-d <br />&nbsp;6. Puppet making. <br />&nbsp;7. Bookmaking classes (with parents) <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Charge: The charge is $15 for a one-hour class. The monthly fee is $60.<br />&nbsp;Materials included.<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Deborah Wasserman&#039;s biography:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and raised in Israel, Deborah Wasserman is currently living and working in Queens, NY.&nbsp; She is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program.&nbsp; Deborah Wasserman has received grants from the Experimental Television Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Aljira Center for the Arts and the America-Israel cultural foundation. Her work has been exhibited in the USA, Brazil, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel, in such venues as The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Tel Aviv Museum of the Arts, The World Wide Video Festival, White Columns, Gale Gates Gallery, GenArt and A.I.R gallery.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;To see my teaching resume, please go to my we site at:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html</a><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Looking forward to working together,<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Deborah<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.deborahwasserman.com</a> &lt;http://www.deborahwasserman.com&gt; <br /><br />&nbsp;If interested in enrolling, please contact me at: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

					Hello everybody!!!<br /><br />A workout group has started a week ago in Traver&#039;s park.&nbsp; Leading us is a very experienced and incredible trainer (his name is Kiki) who worked with me before.&nbsp; You will see and experience results very fast (from my own experience). We do some cardiovascular and we exercise almost every part of our bodies.&nbsp; It&#039;s not too hard, but it&#039;s also not too easy. It is perfectly fit to your level!.&nbsp; The goal is to help everyone (whatever level, age) to get fit, lose weight and feel GREAT! Working out in the fresh air really makes you feel so energized and satisfied.<br /><br />This is our second week and we already have a set schedule for next week.&nbsp; We will stick to this schedule until more people will join.&nbsp; Then we will open up more classes.&nbsp; All of you are welcome to come by, try it out (first trial class is for free), and join!<br /><br /><br />Weekly schedule:<br /><br />Monday Evenings at 7:15PM-8:15PM<br /><br />Wednesday mornings at: 10:00AM-11:00AM<br /><br />Saturday mornings at&nbsp; 12:00PM-1:00PM<br /><br />Sunday mornings at: 10:00AM-11:00AM<br /><br />The price for each class is $15.&nbsp; You can purchase class cards.&nbsp; A 12 class card comes with 2 bonus classes. <br /><br />Please remember not to eat two hours prior to class.&nbsp; Drinking a smoothie or a protein drink two hours prior to working out is a great idea!<br /><br />Please bring along: A jumping rope, water and yoga mats. Do wear good shoes so you don&#039;t harm your feet. If you do not have all this equipment, come with whatever you have.&nbsp; we change locations in the park according to whatever activity is taking place.&nbsp; we will be recognized easily, though.<br /><br /><br />Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at 10:00AM and next week on Mon evening and Wed morning.<br /><br />If you are interested, please email me and let me know when you think you can attend, or just show up.&nbsp; I am just helping Kiki organize this and keep track of the students, schedule etc...<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Deborah<br /><a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br />

					Hello friends,<br /><br />Our third JH Artists meeting will take place on Sunday, November 23rd at<br />Terraza CafÃ©. We will meet at 4:30 (which allows parents to make it to the<br />meeting).<br /><br />We are planning on screening videos by members of the group (some of them<br />works in progress that need feedback), discussing some hot issues<br />(deadlines, opportunities, Studio spaces...) and hanging out with a nice<br />drink.<br /><br />Please bring along any information that you would like to share: an exhibit,<br />a workshop, an application to a show or a grant, and some personal cards.<br /><br />For those of you who still want to submit a video to the screening, please<br />get in touch with me ASAP.<br /><br />Please spread the word amongst your artists friends. &nbsp;Those meetings are not<br />only for visual artists. &nbsp;Writers, movie makers (obviously) and musicians<br />are very welcome!<br /><br /><br /><br />Terazza CafÃ©<br /><br />40-19 Gleane Street between Baxter and Britton Avenue (just around the<br />corner from Roosevelt Avenue and 83rd Street)<br />718-803-9602<br />Terraza serves a variety of coffee, juice, and tea drinks, as well as wine,<br />beer, and mixed drinks. It features live music, art exhibitions and<br />workshops, and screenings of independent and foreign-language cinema. Time<br />Out New York describes Terraza as a &quot;Williamsburgish lounge.&quot; The Queens<br />Gazette says &quot;Terraza is the brainchild of Freddy Castiblanco, who wanted to<br />create a multi-media, multi-cultural experience in the most diverse city in<br />the world.

					JHâ€™s MIDSUMMER HAILED IN<br />SHOW BUSINESS WEEKLY<br />FINAL WEEK!!!<br /><br />From the Review...<br />â€œI stepped into the theater and was swallowed wholly by the world of the<br />play, and was shaken only by violent fits of laughter.<br />The production&#039;s modern take proves once and for all that Shakespeare&#039;s<br />words are compelling even when his characters are rapping...this<br />production pulls Shakespeare&#039;s timeless themes into real life, but does it<br />without losing the surrealism of A Midsummer Night. The light design<br />accentuates the magical quality of a play in which most characters think<br />they are merely dreaming...The combination of one of Shakespeare&#039;s<br />funniest works, a fresh cast and Kristin Skye Hoffman&#039;s direction makes<br />this A Midsummer Night well worth a trip to Queens.â€<br />A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream<br />COMDEY by William Shakespeare<br /><br /><br />FINAL WEEK!!!<br />Thursday â€“ SOLD OUT<br />Friday â€“ Saturday 8pm<br />Saturday Matinee 3pm<br />Professional Production<br />inside the Garden School<br />33-16 79th Street near Northern Blvd<br />TIX at the door<br />Or at Espresso 77 (35-57 77th Street) or <a href="http://www.SmartTix.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.SmartTix.com</a>.<br /><a href="http://www.QueensGardenStage.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.QueensGardenStage.org</a> â€“ 718-874-9431<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

					Hello there!<br /><br />I posted this on JH families and someone suggested that I post it on this site.&nbsp; Here is the original posting:<br /><br />My husband and I are in the process of applying for a Coop in JH, and hopefully we will be moving in soon.&nbsp; We are Williamsburg &quot;refugees&quot; in the sense that we are priced out of our lovely neighborhood (constructions everywhere) where we have spent almost 7 years of our lives(did not buy the dream loft when it was still possible). We have been looking at JH for a while, since it seems like a friendly, affordable, dynamic and good neighborhood for us and our children.&nbsp; I hope we are going to love it.<br /><br />Anyway, I am a painter and one of the things I liked about Williamsburg was the arts community and working spaces.&nbsp; Although the commute is not far, I would probably like to relocate my studio to JH.&nbsp; I know that many of you artists work in L.I.C., but are there any spaces in the &#039;hood? If there are, are they &quot;living spaces&quot; or commercial spaces? If I was going to rent an apartment and share it with other artists, would anyone be interested?<br /><br />I am also curious to know a bit about the art scene.&nbsp; I heard about Gallery Y and a know a bunch of really good artists living and working in JH.&nbsp; I am wondering if many of the artists meet somewhere, is there a centralized feeling about it, are they connected or dispersed? These may seem like dumb questions, but coming from a neighborhood with over 25 galleries and a hot art scene you would understand where I am coming from. I feel like it would be nice to meet other artists in the area and create a &quot;salon&quot; type of thing, if people are interested, where we can do studio visits, critics etc...<br /><br /><br />Since I posted the above email a dynamic discussion followed on the internet and the outcome of that is that we will be holding an artist meeting in the neighborhood in a few weeks.&nbsp; We want to discuss: working spaces, opportunities for showing work and creating a vibrant arts community.&nbsp; I have received many responses to my email and my feeling is that there are many artists in the &#039;hood who are looking to connect.&nbsp; I will keep you informed about the location of the meeting, time and date etc...<br /><br />I hope that we will get organized as an arts community and enjoy and share everyone creativity!<br />Best,<br />Deborah<br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.deborahwasserman.com</a><br /><a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a>
