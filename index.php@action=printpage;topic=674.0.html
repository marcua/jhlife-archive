				I saw Shelby2&#039;s post on a language exchange program and was intrigued. I&#039;m just wondering how many languages the people on this board speak. For myself: Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Spanish, and a tiny bit of Amharic. I would love to learn some Arabic and Russian.

				I&#039;m a language dunce, and am generally proud of myself if I can speak English fluently (yes, that&#039;s my native tongue).<br /><br />yt28--Now I&#039;m curious... how did you learn Amharic?&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in two neighborhoods with large Ethiopian populations (Adams Morgan in DC and North Oakland) and loved the food &amp; shops, but never managed to say anything that&#039;s not on a menu.&nbsp; But there&#039;s not much of a population here in NYC, as far as I can tell.

				yt - that&#039;s impressive!&nbsp; Great thread.&nbsp; Maybe even more interesting would be the stories behind why people speak the languages they do.<br /><br />I speak French well enough to live in France and get by just fine, but never achieved fluency.&nbsp; Right now I am learning Spanish but still am pretty much a total beginner, though it&#039;s great to live here where I can try out my new vocabulary a little bit every day, hear it on the street every day and try to decipher the signs in Spanish.<br /><br />I have also had the opportunity to learn complete sentences in Japanese, Twi, and Arabic.

				I worked in Ethiopia last summer, and could communicate fairly well by the time I left - now, not so much. I&#039;ve also lived near U Street in DC and was pretty familiar with all the Ethiopian joints...I love Ethiopian food :) It&#039;s too bad Queens doesn&#039;t have an Ethiopian restaurant...or does it? I&#039;ve tried all the ones in Manhattan. There is a fairly large Ethiopian presence here but they&#039;re not concentrated together like in DC.

				I agree that this is great thread.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice opportunity to see how diverse we all are, in addition to reading how some of us have learned different languages given our own personal experiences.<br /><br />Having been born in Ecuador, my first language is Spanish.&nbsp; I can speak, read and write in Spanish, but have noticed over the years that unless one&nbsp; practices it regularly, you do tend to lose some of your skill.&nbsp; As a result, my husband and I have made efforts to speak Spanish more frequently at home.

				I did a lot of traveling for my employer, and at one point I accepted a sub-contractor position overseas, so my language skills had to be on par with the local residents or my ability to perform my duties would have been diminished.<br /><br />From my parents I learned Hungarian, Hebrew and Yiddish.<br /><br />To survive the business world I learned French, Italian, Spanish, German, Danish, some Norwegian and Portuguese.<br /><br />To be able to order and purchase from local Astoria restaurants and green grocers my Greek has become better than just sufficient!

				I am competent in Spanish, but get very confused when conjugating verbs.&nbsp; At least as a teacher I know how to say &quot;su hijo esta cortando la clase de ciencia.&quot;&nbsp; I probably say that about five times a week. :)&nbsp; I think all teachers around here eventually pick up a little Spanish.&nbsp; It really helps during parent-teacher conferences, which by the way for high schools are this Thursday and Friday!

				Prester, although I have traveled back to Ecuador a few times, none of my trips have been within the past few years.&nbsp; I have so much family living in Ecuador today, that when I have visited, most of my time is spent house hopping rather than touring the country.&nbsp; In a strange way, I can almost say that I&#039;ve taken Ecuador for granted by not partaking in what is offered by some of the country&#039;s most renowned attractions.&nbsp; I&#039;ve traveled through Cuenca, enjoyed the Fiestas de Ambato, shopped the markets at Otavalo and enjoyed the sites of Quito.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most visits have been rushed because we always have had to make time to go and visit family.&nbsp; Hmmm...come to think of it, that&#039;s not so unfortunate all!&nbsp; My next trip will mostly likely be something that is planned with the specific purpose of seeing the sites and familiarizing myself with my homeland.&nbsp; Nariz del Diablo...anyone?<br />

				Unfortunately I can&#039;t speak or understand Spanish very well&nbsp; :(, but I did study it here in New York and in Buenos Aires and there are definitely some different pronunciations.&nbsp; I think Argentines say they say they speak Castellano, hence the vos.&nbsp; <br /><br />The biggest differences of pronunciation that I recall are the â€œyâ€ as in &quot;yo,&quot; and the double-l as in â€œpolloâ€ each has a â€œshjoâ€ sound (for lack of a better way to express it phonetically).&nbsp; Some people also seemed to swallow their â€œs,â€ as in â€œOscarâ€ the s would somehow be expressed but not actually vocalized if that makes any sense, and that was hard to get the hang of understanding but Iâ€™m not sure if that was just more of a very localized accent from certain neighborhoods.&nbsp; <br /><br />They also have a slang called &quot;lunfardo&quot; but I&#039;m not sure how widely that&#039;s actually spoken.
