				Many of you have heard about our program.&nbsp; We are now entering our seventh year!<br /><br />We are passionate about art and art education and we offer excellent art classes for students ages 4.5-15.<br /><br />Our program focuses on creativity, experimentation and skill building while learning about art movements and artists, and experimenting with different techniques.<br /><br />Our classes are fun and engaging as we believe that art is a joyful expression of our creativity.<br /><br />Check out our website (www.artforastartny.com) for more information and you can read some testimonials.<br /><br />We were mentioned in Mommy Poppins as &#039;30 Fun Things To Do With Your Kids In Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Fall registration is still going on. Our starting date is the first week of January.<br /><br />Email us at:&nbsp; ;)deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br />ART FOR A START 2018 ACADEMIC YEAR SCHEDULE<br /><br />All regular classes are one hour long. We create a thematic and well-planned curriculum and send weekly emails informing parents about our plan for the week. All classes are taught by artist and educator Deborah Wasserman. Our program is considered by many to be exceptional, and we have students who are now registering for their fifth year.<br /><br />Spring semester 2018<br /><br />Art for a Start offers five sessions per week at P.S. 69 (37th Avenue between 77th and 78th Street).<br /><br />The 4:00PM classes are geared towards younger students and the 5:00PM classes are geared towards older students&nbsp; If your child&#039;s schedule cannot accommodate these particular age groups, we suggest that you still take one or two trial classes, as many students end up thriving with younger/older peers.<br /><br />Tuesdays:<br /><br />&nbsp;4:00PM-5:00PM, Ages 4-7, Location: P.S. 69. (class is full capacity)<br /><br />&nbsp;5:00PM-6:00PM, Ages 7-10 Location: P.S. 69. <br /><br /><br /><br />Wednesdays:<br /><br />4:00PM-5:00PM, Ages 4-7, Location: P.S. 69. <br /><br />5:00PM-6:00PM, Ages 7-10 Location: P.S. 69. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thursdays:<br /><br />5:00-6:00PM, Ages 7-11, Advanced class for outstanding students. (class is full capacity)<br /><br /><br /><br />Fees:&nbsp; We require a first month and last month payment for each semester, based on $20.00 class fee plus a $20.00 material&#039;s fee per semester. Students can take up to two trial classes before you make a full commitment for one semester. Trial classes are paid classes.<br /><br />​<br /><br />Saturdays Portfolio Prep Classes:<br /><br />Saturday classes take place at Mondo Studios in Woodside (55th Street between 37th Ave. and Broadway).<br /><br />Saturday classes run from: 11:00-12:30AM-12:00PM. Fee: $40.00 per class <br /><br />​<br /><br />We have been successfully preparing students for High School admissions in the areas of Film, Fine Arts and Fashion design. Our students are accepted to schools such as Frank Sinatra, High School of Fashion Industries and La Guardia School of the Arts.<br /><br />We work with each student individually, assessing their talents and needs and then we build an original and unique portfolio, based on the school&#039;s requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br />Private Classes:<br /><br />We are available to schedule private classes throughout the year.&nbsp; Please contact us if interested in arranging a meeting to discuss the possibility of a private art class.&nbsp; &nbsp;We offer portfolio preparation class for teenagers and young adults who are applying for art schools and are seeking to build a strong presentation. We also offer private classes for young students who are interested in more focused, artistic training.<br /><br /><br /><br />Deborah Wasserman<br />Artist, Museum Professional and Educator <br /><br />www.artforastartny.com<br />www.deborahwasserman.com<br /><br />

				&nbsp;These classes are a neighborhood treasure. If your kid has any art inclination, most likely they will enjoy these<br />classes. Deb W., the instructor, is the real deal which matters with any early introduction to creative fields.
