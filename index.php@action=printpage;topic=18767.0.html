				Thank you Paul 11372.&nbsp; I read the article.&nbsp; Very disturbing but not shocking considering decades and possibly centuries of Catholic Priest abuse against young boys.&nbsp;

				as a semi-lapsed Catholic who attends Joan of Arc on occasion, it saddens me. but, yes, does not surprise. well into my 30s, i discovered that the kindest, gentlest priest from the parish i grew up in had been implicated and defrocked. the ubiquity of this criminal behavior is jaw dropping.

				Remember, all you need to do to get a payout from the wealthy Catholic Church is say that you too were abused by Otto Garcia. Who could ever prove that this didn’t happen? You just need to have been around him or any of the other priests named during the time period. It is better than a lottery. 100% win. Millions in payouts.

I know of several parents who have taken their children out due to some suspicious (non sexual) activity of staff that was reported and nothing was done about it. I totally believe this and this&nbsp; church and school should be investigated for embezzlement as&nbsp; well.

				How do you prove if a priest rubbed himself on a child twenty years ago? People make up stories all the time to get a paycheck. Remember the Supreme Court hearings. Ridiculous lies and politicians were quick to repeat them.

				Dssjh, you seem concentrated on personal attacks. You obviously speak from your own criminal mindset. <br /><br />The reason we have the concept of statue of limitations is prevent people being exposed to accusations twenty or thirty years after something has happened being forced to defend yourself. Children also have poor memories and eyewitness testimony is unreliable after such time. I have no idea if any of these allegations are true or not but just exposing that they is an other motive to invent these stories. A huge payout.

				The latest news regarding sexual abuse inside the Catholic Church is an article in today&#039;s NY Post about Nuns sexually abusing other Nuns.&nbsp; A former Nun who grew lived in Woodside has a lot to say about this issue.&nbsp; In every religion and profession you have undesirables.&nbsp; Its disturbing that we have to read about this almost everyday.&nbsp; I have less of a problem with a Nun attempting to violate another Nun who is an adult but for a Priest to attack an innocent child who is defenseless is deplorable.&nbsp;

				Absolutely DISGUSTING, but not surprising. Who wants to rally around his safe little rectory demanding justice? Nobody? Oh, we&#039;re just gonna complain on a forum? Oh, ok.
