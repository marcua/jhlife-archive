				Great video. This is a typical JH galley kitchen. I&#039;ve grown to love ours. At first I had grand plans to rip it all out and have an &quot;open floor plan&quot;. But all the budget was going to the bathroom, which was in much worse shape. So we did what we thought at the time would be a temporary DIY. Paint, additional cabinets, subway tiled backsplash, fixtures. Here&#039;s a before and after:<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/LBZ08Cfl.jpg)<br />(http://i.imgur.com/ckpaKHel.jpg)<br /><br />Now, having lived with it a while, I love a galley kitchen. Keeps cooking smells in the kitchen, and after dinner dishes out of sight until we&#039;re ready to deal with them.
