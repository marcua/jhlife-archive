				The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund recently went public with details on the assault of Leslie Mora on Roosevelt Avenue at 72<sup>nd</sup> Street on 19 June. She was beaten with a belt buckle until a passerby threatened to contact the police. In my â€™blog (http://elyaqim.blogspot.com/2009/07/anti-transanti-gay-assault-in-jackson.html), I collected a little bibliography of the first articles I encountered on the subject. See http://elyaqim.blogspot.com/2009/07/anti-transanti-gay-assault-in-jackson.html.

				Was this the same woman who was on NY1 news yesterday?&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall the location being JH (which I would have remembered).&nbsp; This is terrible.. it&#039;s bad enough to have 1 incident, I really hope there were not two...&nbsp; Maybe the news said Elmhurst and it was really JH.

				it was in JH<br /><br />the district attorney treated the assault as a joke and let the dung beetles off on their own recognizance, signaling his approval of their actions and freeing them to assault again.<br /><br />perhaps if he were on the other end of the weapons, he&#039;d think differently. we shall see
