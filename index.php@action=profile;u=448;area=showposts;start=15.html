					Woodside is the next hot neighborhood in Queens (see the articles below from the NY Daily News, NY Times, and Crain&#039;s). We have a large, bright, loft-like workspace available (1680sf) located on the 2nd (top) floor of a commercial building in Woodside. The space is safe, secure and very quiet, with 24/7 access. <br /><br />Our building is conveniently located 1.5 blocks from the M and R Northern Blvd. subway station, three stops from Manhattan. There are many small businesses that are popping up nearby (for example, there are upholstery, wood-working, and shipping companies all next to us). This unit has a sink, dishwasher, marble counter, bathroom and shower, with washer/dryer hook-ups.<br /><br />We are looking forward to renting this unit to a small business, or a company with friendly people. It can be possible to subdivide the unit for a shared workspace. You have a private entrance, and the rest of the floor is occupied by artist / creative studios--cool neighbors! <br /><br />Please get in touch with me directly (off the list) if you are interested in more information and/or scheduling a viewing.<br /><br />Thanks,

					Good afternoon to all of you and happy 2014 !!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />Have you considered registering your child to art classes? If so, why not do it NOW? ART FOR A START Spring semester is starting this week!!! Attached is the class schedule.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries you may have.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Yours,<br />Deborah<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartnyc.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.artforastartnyc.com</a><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I recently read an article in the NYTimes entitled: Art Makes You Smart <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0</a>) and I could not agree more.&nbsp; Working as an art educator for over fifteen years, I&nbsp; witnessed how exposure to art has contributed to the overall well being of my students and to their mental, verbal and creative development. Having tutored art students for high schools and universities, it&#039;s evident that the development of drawing capabilities and design tools from an early age is invaluable.&nbsp; My arts program is Inquiry-based, no crafty and cookie-cutter projects, no rigid emphasis on techniques. The curriculum emphasizes&nbsp; explorations, skill building, creativity and experimentation. My life&#039;s mission is to share my passion for the arts through my artwork and teaching. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />ART FOR A START 2014 SPRING SEMESTER<br />&nbsp;<br />*Spring Semester starts on January 7th and will end on June 25th.<br />&nbsp;<br />All regular classes are one hour long and the fee is $15.00 per class, including materials. We create a thematic and well-planned curriculum and send weekly emails informing parents about our plan for the week. Subjects to explore throughout the year:<br />&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in drawings<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in painting<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Collage techniques<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sculpture and 3-d<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watercolors<br />&nbsp;<br />All classes are taught by artist and educator Deborah Wasserman. Our program is considered by many as exceptional, and we have students who are now registering for their third year.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Regular weekly classes<br />Art for a Start offers four sessions per week at P.S. 69<br />(37th Avenue between 77th and 78th Street):<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wednesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM.<br />&nbsp;<br />The 4:00PM classes are geared towards younger students (ages 5-7) and the 5:00PM classes are geared towards older students (ages 7-9). If your child&#039;s schedule cannot accommodate these particular age groups, we suggest that you still take one or two trial classes, as many students end up thriving with younger/older peers.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Students can take up to two trial classes before you make a full commitment for one semester. Trial classes are paid classes.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Fees: We require a first month and last month payment for each semester when registering plus a $10.00 registration fee. The last month payment covers the fee for the month on which the semester ends.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the program before it ends, you will lose your last month payment. We are open to make exceptions to this rule in the case of an emergency or any unplanned circumstances.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Enrollment is capped at 10 students per class. Keeping our classes small allows us to give more personal attention to each student.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Make up classes are available.

					Good afternoon to all of you and happy 2014 !!!!<br /><br />Have you considered registering your child to art classes? If so, why not do it NOW? ART FOR A START Spring semester is starting this week!!! Attached is the class schedule.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries you may have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yours,<br />Deborah<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartnyc.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.artforastartnyc.com</a><br /><br /><br /><br />I recently read an article in the NYTimes entitled: Art Makes You Smart <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0</a>) and I could not agree more.&nbsp; Working as an art educator for over fifteen years, I&nbsp; witnessed how exposure to art has contributed to the overall well being of my students and to their mental, verbal and creative development. Having tutored art students for high schools and universities, it&#039;s evident that the development of drawing capabilities and design tools from an early age is invaluable.&nbsp; My arts program is Inquiry-based, no crafty and cookie-cutter projects, no rigid emphasis on techniques. The curriculum<br />&nbsp;emphasizes&nbsp; explorations, skill building, creativity and experimentation. My life&#039;s mission is to share my passion for the arts through my artwork and teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />ART FOR A START 2014 ACADEMIC YEAR SCHEDULE<br />&nbsp;<br />*Spring Semester starts on January 7th and will end on June 25th.<br /><br />All regular classes are one hour long and the fee is $15.00 per class, including materials. We create a thematic and well-planned curriculum and send weekly emails informing parents about our plan for the week. Subjects to explore throughout the year:<br />&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in drawings<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in painting<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Collage techniques<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sculpture and 3-d<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watercolors<br />&nbsp;<br />All classes are taught by artist and educator Deborah Wasserman. Our program is considered by many as exceptional, and we have students who are now registering for their third year.<br />&nbsp;<br />SPRING SEMESTER 2014<br />&nbsp;<br />Regular weekly classes<br />Art for a Start offers four sessions per week at P.S. 69<br />(37th Avenue between 77th and 78th Street):<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wednesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM.<br />&nbsp;<br />The 4:00PM classes are geared towards younger students (ages 5-7) and the 5:00PM classes are geared towards older students (ages 7-9). If your child&#039;s schedule cannot accommodate these particular age groups, we suggest that you still take one or two trial classes, as many students end up thriving with younger/older peers.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Students can take up to two trial classes before you make a full commitment for one semester. Trial classes are paid classes.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Fees: We require a first month and last month payment for each semester when registering plus a $10.00 registration fee. The last month payment covers the fee for the month on which the semester ends.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the program before it ends, you will lose your last month payment. We are open to make exceptions to this rule in the case of an emergency or any unplanned circumstances.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Enrollment is capped at 10 students per class. Keeping our classes small allows us to give more personal attention to each student.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Make up classes are available. Tuesdays and Wednesdays classes are very similar in age and content.&nbsp; You are welcome to bring your child to any of these classes if he or she missed their regular class. <br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes<br />Saturday classes take place at Mondo Studios in Woodside<br />(33-55 55th Street between 37th Ave. and Broadway, one block from the M/R Northern Blvd subway station).<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:00AM-11:00PM<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11:00:00-12:00 <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12:00 to 1:00PM<br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes are one hour long, specialized lessons with no more than five students per class.

Please contact us if interested in this class.<br /><br />About ART for a START:<br /><br /><br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (P.S. 69) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children and adults for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum, Rotunda Gallery, The College of New Jersey) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br /><br />Deborah Wasserman&#039;s biography:<br /><br />Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and raised in Israel, Deborah Wasserman is currently living and working in Queens, NY.&nbsp; She is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program with a Masters and a Post Masters degree.&nbsp; Deborah Wasserman has received grants from the Experimental Television Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Aljira Center for the Arts and the America-Israel cultural foundation. Her work has been exhibited in the USA, Brazil, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel, in such venues as The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Tel Aviv Museum of the Arts, The World Wide Video Festival, White Columns, Gale Gates Gallery, GenArt and A.I.R gallery.<br /><br /><br />To see my teaching resume, please go to my we site at:<br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for choosing ART for a START!<br />We are very excited to work with you once again!<br /><br /><br />Deborah<br /><br />ART for a START<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.artforastartny.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.deborahwasserman.com</a><br />Contact me at: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

					Hello everyone!<br />&nbsp;<br />First of all I am delighted to share with you that four of our ART for a START students have won an award or a mention at the Queensboro Bridge art contest at L.I.C. Open. There were total of about sixteen kids who won an award and there were HUNDREDS of entries. <br />&nbsp;<br />Since we launched ART for a START in October we had a wonderful year of creativity and skill building with over 40 students enrolled (ages 3-20). All of ART for a START classes will end in June and will resume classes in mid September 2011.&nbsp; Registration will start in the beginning of August.<br />&nbsp;<br />We will be offering, however, an exclusive Sumi Workshop in our Woodside studio for three consecutive Saturdays in July:<br />&nbsp;<br />What is Sumi Painting? Sumi Ink and wash painting is an East Asian type of brush &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_brush&gt;&nbsp; painting &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting&gt;&nbsp; also known as wash painting or by its Japanese name sui-boku-ga.&nbsp; On a spiritual level, Sumi attempts to capture the spirit of nature with ease and flow, while depicting landscapes or still life.&nbsp; On a technical level, the artist must work with confidence and ease while applying ink unto rice paper.&nbsp; Itâ€™s a very precise and yet improvised technique, which teaches concentration and â€˜Going with the flowâ€™ at once. Itâ€™s like meditation!!! I have been â€˜testingâ€™ these workshops with my older students (8-13 years old) and they all fell in love with it (not to mention that the results are beautiful and SO rewarding!). <br />&nbsp;<br />This three weeks course will consist of:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. A short background, Power Point presentation, explaining and introducing the art of Sumi.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Enhancing drawing skills in order to train the hand-eye coordination in order to perform quick sketches with ink. <br />&nbsp;<br />3. Sumi wash paintings on traditional rice paper with ink and Sumi brushes (all materials are non toxic).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Information about Sumi Classes:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Classes will consist of no more that 6 students at a time (I will group them by age) and will be 1.5 hours long. They will take place in our Woodside studio (55th Street between 37th Ave and Broadway). Dates for classes: Saturdays: July 5th, July9th and July 15th.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Ages: 7 and up. The price per class will be $25 and that includes materials.&nbsp; Classes will be offered in the morning time (9:30AM-11:00AM, 11:00AM â€“ 12:30PM depending on enrollment). Registration fee is required which will go towards the last class.&nbsp; &nbsp;The total for this three weeks workshop will be $75.00.&nbsp; <br />I am offering siblings discount, and a special discount for currently enrolled ART for a START students.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. We may decide to add a field trip in the end of the class to Asia Society so we can examine original Sumi paintings. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />If interested, please get in touch with me via my web site (listed below) . I will be happy to send you images of my studentâ€™s work.&nbsp; I posted one on my web site under â€˜class schedule/Pricingâ€™.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you!<br /><br />Deborah Wasserman<br />ART for a START<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.artforastartny.com</a>
