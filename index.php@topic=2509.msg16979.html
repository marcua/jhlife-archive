								<div class="inner" id="msg_16967">Hi everyone,<br /><br />My family and I closed on a co-op in JH in November 2008.&nbsp; &nbsp;During 2008-&#039;09 our building had about 60 rental units that were converted to co-op status and sold by a sponsor, so a significant fraction of the co-op residents are new owners.<br /><br />Earlier this year the co-op informed everybody that the maintenance fees would increase by 5% starting in April to cover a higher tax assessment.&nbsp; Even though the RE market has flattened or dropped in the area, the tax assessments apparently take a few years to catch up.&nbsp; Fair enough.<br /><br />This weekend everyone received a letter along with their maintenance bill stating that we are being charged an additional tax assessment this month of about $0.65 / share.&nbsp; In our building that works out to almost a double maintenance fee for the month of April.&nbsp; This is on top of the 5% increase in maintenance that kicked in this month.<br /><br />Here is where things get really confusing.&nbsp; Most of that additional assessment fee will be covered by the $400 NYC tax abatement, STAR , senior citizen programs, etc, <strong>EXCEPT FOR NEW RESIDENTS</strong>.&nbsp; The managing agent claims that new residents are not eligible for the tax abatement if we bought after Jan 1st 2008, so we will have to pay the full assessment.&nbsp; The management also suggests that they are taking the tax abatements to &quot;balance the budget&quot;, and not necessarily to cover higher RE taxes (although this point is not at all clear in the letter).<br /><br />If you have read this far, then I would like to request your opinion on the following questions:<br /><br />1) Does it seem right to charge an additional tax assessment if the maintenance has already been increased 5% to cover the higher tax bill?&nbsp; And maintenance fees in our building are higher than what I&#039;ve seen in RE ads for Jackson Heights, even though the building finances seem to be in good shape.<br /><br />2) If new residents are not eligible for the tax abatement because they weren&#039;t owners during the full period the abatement covers, then why are new residents &quot;eligible&quot; to be charged a full tax assessment?&nbsp; It seems like the management is having it both ways, but only in the ways that favor taking more money from us.<br /><br />My suspicion is that someone on the board or at the management agency saw a one-time opportunity to make a windfall off of the ~60 new owners in the building by charging this assessment when they knew the abatement was not available.&nbsp; Back of the envelope calculations would suggest that this additional tax assessment amounts to $40,000-$60,000 for the co-op.<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; Other similar experiences?</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_16973">As a former board member, I can say that would never fly in my building- you don&#039;t assess everyone at such a high amount the same month they&#039;re being billed.&nbsp; Usually there&#039;s 1 or 2 month&#039;s notice and a clear explanation in the letter that the assessment is occurring at a certain month in the future because the STAR will help offset the assessment (and therefore impact residents the least).&nbsp; I read somewhere that it&#039;s common for co-ops in NYC to coincide assessments with STAR and other rebate programs.&nbsp; Why did your building not give you advance notice?&nbsp; Sounds like they slipped up somewhere.<br /><br />Also, you make a good point that residents who haven&#039;t been in the building for a full year are unfairly impacted by the tax assessment.&nbsp; If this is a real sticking point, you could call for a special shareholder meeting to discuss this with the board.&nbsp; Or you can get yourself elected on the board next year and try to change the rules so that you can help out future residents- maybe prorate future assessments (and believe me, there will be more!) by months in residence during the year, etc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s even reasonable but you can try.<br /><br />One more thing, I&#039;m pretty sure the assessment was not to target the 60 new owners.&nbsp; If the sponsor still owned the 60 units today, the sponsor would have to pay the assessment just like everyone else (and I know the sponsor isn&#039;t eligible for STAR because you have to live in the apt you own to be eligible).&nbsp; The only thing I would question is what is being balanced with your assessment- higher energy costs?&nbsp; You have a right to know this.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_16979">As a current board member I would like to share my opinion with you.&nbsp; I agree that an additional tax assessment on top of a recent 5% maintenance increase was ill-timed, however, there is a very short window of time when you can assess back the tax abatement, which is what your building is doing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, new owners like yourself do not qualify for the tax abatement and therefore have to pay the full assessment out of pocket, but there is nothing that can be done about that because the assessment has to be applied equally across all shareholders. (please remember that this assessment is not really a tax assessment but rather an normal assessment timed to coincide with the tax abatement in order to limit the financial impact on shareholders).&nbsp; In cases like yours, if it is a real financial burden, I would suggest that you ask for the assessment to be broken up into a few payments.&nbsp; We are currently assessing back an amount equivalent to the general tax abatement that our coop received, however we have divided it up over 5 months, so it is only an additional $20-40 dollars a month, depending on the number of shares owned.&nbsp; I think that most buildings in this neighborhood assess back the tax abatement in order to cover general operating expenses or to put towards a much needed capital improvement project.&nbsp; In our buildings we are putting the money towards the operating costs as a way to defer a much needed maintenance increase that we are trying to hold off implementing.&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that the members of your board are not out to get you or any other new owners. On the contrary, they are trying to keep your building afloat and in the black.&nbsp; They have a financial obligation to do what is best for the corporation and all of the shareholders and you should also keep in mind that they are paying the exact same maintenance increase and assessment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Without knowing what coop you are in and without seeing the books for your coop I can not give completely accurate advice, however, I can tell you that 40,000-60,000 dollars is nothing for a coop and that the cost of a minor elevator repair, garbage compactors, leaks on the&nbsp; roof, etc... would eat up that extra money immediately!&nbsp; It is incredibly expensive to properly operate and maintain a coop and a coop that does not have a very large reserve will always need to assess back tax abatements and apply other assessments just to keep the buildings afloat.&nbsp; <br />As cumbersome and unfair as these as assessments seem, the coop board is just trying to do what is in the best interest of the building(s).&nbsp; If the buildings are not fiscally sound then your property values will drop and everyone will have a hard time selling their apartments.&nbsp; <br /><br />In conclusion, I agree with the other poster who said if you don&#039;t like it, then run for the board.&nbsp; Although I think that once on the board you will see that it is not so black and white and you will see what a thankless and burdensome job it is to be on the board.<br /><br />Best of luck and welcome to the Jackson Heights!</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17013">Thank you for your responses...they include a lot of useful perspectives!&nbsp; I posted here hoping to get information rather than just popping off uninformed!&nbsp; I called our co-op accountant yesterday to find out what is going on, but he didn&#039;t even know what was in the letter so was going to call me back.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t, so I&#039;ll pursue again this morning.<br /><br />I still maintain that all shareholders are not being treated equally if the same assessments are levied against shareholders that have lived in the building for only 1/6th of the time period the assessment putatively covers, versus shareholders that have been there for the whole year (and are eligible for the assessment).&nbsp; Giving three days notice of a bill for hundreds of dollars also seems like bad practice.</div>
