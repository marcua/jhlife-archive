				I have recently been introduced to a line of products that are designed for wellness, that are environmentally safe<br />&nbsp;( no child caps requires), highly effective - daily vitamin packs = 33 daily Centrum or 15 One A Day due to super absorbency in the blood stream ,and are not meant to add to your monthly shopping.&nbsp; You simply replace products you bring home from the supermarket ( i.e. laundry detergent, dishwasher liquid, soaps, creams etc.) with these eco friendly products - did you know that&nbsp; most dishwashing liquids have chlorine bleach in them. Products are bio degradable and concentrated so the resulting throw away plastic bottles is less. Plus you have an opportunity to save money by buying direct or even to make money by selling to friends, family and associates.&nbsp; It is a no brainer for me and I was skeptical but the products are great.&nbsp; Go to their website www.melaleuca.com <br /><br />If anyone is interested in getting involved to buy the products or learn how to make extra cash or even turn it into a business. Please email me @&nbsp; &nbsp;jhinjh@gmail.com and I would be glad to meet or chat with you.&nbsp; This coming Thursday evening a woman who has made this a career and is very successful&nbsp; $200,000+ per year is in NY and if enough peple are interested she will give a presentation at my apartment on 78th street.&nbsp; You are welcome to contact me and see if it is a fit for you.&nbsp; My personal business has taken a hit and this is an opportunity to contribute to the environment as well as supplement my income......I look forward to hearing from you.

				Thanks for the links.&nbsp; I have read them all and of course there are going to be people who are not happy.&nbsp; But I am trying to assess the overall benefits less the detriments. Whether it be because of the concept of how it is marketed or a customer service order&nbsp; complaint or the concept of buying things that you have not tested is hard for people to wrap their heads around.&nbsp; The fact that you are replacing things you normally buy with their brands and that the brands, from those that I have tried, are good quality is important.&nbsp; The eco friendly, bio-degradable, non toxic issue is important as well.<br /><br />The company has won the Bettter Business Bureau Blue Torch&nbsp; award and has been listed in Fortune 500 fastest growing companies for 5 years, they have no debt and have won the Blue Chip Enterprise Award from the US Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />Thanks for the reply and I am being honest if I did not think they were good products and if I find down the line that it is shoody or a scam&nbsp; I willo drop it in a sec.&nbsp; I am just hearing from people who use the product with positive feedback and I have also heard about the things they don&#039;t like...All comments are welcome!

				Thanks for the links.&nbsp; I know there are going to be people who are disatisfied and there are also people who praise the products and the company.&nbsp; Here are a few reviews, in the sake of fairness I did not edit them, here is the good with the bad.&nbsp; BUT a veryi nteresting statistic is that they have a 95% reorder rate every month.<br /><br />http://www.mlmreview.com/mlmreview/melaleuca020.html<br /><br />http://www.viewpoints.com/Melaleuca-Whitening-Tooth-Polish-Cool-Mint-reviews<br /><br />http://sharedreviews.com/review_search?keyword=Melaleuca<br /><br />http://www.mlmreviewkings.com/melaleuca/Loading...

				Just a quick follow up.&nbsp; I have been using their cleaning and laundry products for a month now and the stuff is great!&nbsp; Al eco friendly biodegradable, less than supermarket brands and delivered to your door.&nbsp; Everyone who has used them and I have introduced the products to loves them.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to &quot;sell&quot; the products or refer anyone if you don&#039;t want but the opportunity to use the green products and patented vitamins and health supplements and if you wish to pursue it as a business to supplement income is great. So far no complaints only kudos!&nbsp; No brainer for me - good products + good price + convenience + extra $$$ if I want it....anyone interested let me know, be glad to meet with you or call you.....

				Melaleuca has some great products, and really good customer service in my experience. You can find whatever it is you&#039;re looking for. &nbsp;If you go to a complaint site like those listed above, guess what you&#039;re going to find? &nbsp;Visit www.MelaleucaScam.com (http://www.MelaleucaScam.com) and guess what you&#039;re going to find? <br /><br />You can find can find outlandish complaints from everything from the Red Cross to Best Buy and everything in between. &nbsp;That doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re a scam. &nbsp;Here&#039;s some information I&#039;ve found on the company you might find useful:<br /><br />MelaleucaAwards.com<br />SaferForYourHome.com<br />www.inc.com/magazine/20041015/hidi-vandersloot.html<br />Melaleuca.org<br />Melaleuca Hurricane Katrina<br />http://www.melaleucaawards.com/2005-hall-of-fame.php<br /><br /><br />I think it is fair to look at reviews as well - You might want to also look at www.melaleucascam.com (http://www.melaleucascam.com)

				Just to follow up on the most recent posting....I have now been using a number of the products since February and the majority of them are outstanding in terms of what they do and what they cost in comparison to supermarket brands.&nbsp; The eco friendly aspect is a huge component.&nbsp; There are some products that are just good, but taking the above factors into account I will continue to use them.<br /><br />So far I have been able to supplement my income by recommending them to people and no one has had any complaints. Again, good products, bio degradable, child friendly, cheaper than the supermarket and delivered home....add the opportunity to make extra $$ only if you wish -- it is a no brainer to me!

				And unfortunately for you , you seem to be closed minded and a tad on the negative, and skeptical side with a need to criticize, suggest we stop it&nbsp; - it&#039;s not productive nor useful ----- peace!
