				Anyone have theories as to why The Colonials (82nd between 34th and 35th) tend to be so affordable compared to other co-op buildings in the historic district? Full disclosure: I live in one of the buildings and have been curious about this ever since we moved here in 2015. I&#039;ve got some theories but am curious to hear what others think.

				the biggest drivers of that would be:<br />1) flip tax <br />2) monthly maintenance compared to other buildings on a per square foot basis? i.e. I pay $0.72 per square foot per month <br />3) building condition <br />4) building financials

				For me, it was the apartments themselves.&nbsp; We never got to the financial aspect of the co-ops.&nbsp; It&#039;s been more than 10 years, but during our search, we saw two apartments here, and from my memory, both were on the small side.&nbsp; The kitchen was much smaller than what we ultimately bought, and one of the two bedrooms was tiny.&nbsp; We&#039;d often pass by these buildings and, since the living room is right up in front, we thought they&#039;d be bigger.&nbsp; <br /><br />We did love the living rooms (large, tons of light), and both kitchens that we saw had those European washer/dryer all in one units, but that&#039;s where the love ended.

				I also live in The Colonials. As others have mentioned--no garden and no elevator. And the second bedroom is small. Also, they are organized as small coops (similar to the Greystones, I think).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On the other hand, each unit has a huge living room and a huge dining room with lots of light. And unlike some buildings, these rooms are really separate while still flowing into each other. There&#039;s great details and moldings, and what I think is a good layout (the layouts are identical in all the units): the living room and master bedroom are at opposite ends of the units and the master bedroom is not facing the street. The kitchen is not a galley, which should appeal to some, with the possibility of having a washer/dryer which should make a big difference to many. <br /><br />I wonder if more diversity in terms of the real estate agents representing properties here would have an effect on the pricing.&nbsp;

				Thanks for chiming in, everyone! My theories were along the lines of what Cliffjumper suggested. We don&#039;t have the alluring gardens of many of the buildings in the historic district, and the lack of elevator could be a turnoff. I was also wondering if being zoned for 212 as opposed to 69 might be a flag for some couples with young kids. I hadn&#039;t actually considered the noise issue with the school abutting our back yard, though I can imagine this would be frustrating for anyone who worked from home. I was also wondering if the fact that the buildings are individually managed (as Dodger mentioned) might be a concern for some people. When we do have an assessment, I&#039;m guessing the cost per apartment is higher since there are only 10 units per building.<br /><br />That said, we pay pretty close attention to the listings in the neighborhood and are shocked that the 2 bed/1baths going up for sale now are often priced at a 50% or greater premium compared to what similar units in the Colonials go for. We don&#039;t have a flip tax and maintenance in our building is right in line with others on a per-square-foot-basis. Our building, while more than a century old, is in great shape, and as others have mentioned we love the layout of our apartment. I guess I better check out some of the open houses this weekend to see for myself how all these new listings compare!

				From what I recall from looking at this Colonials apt, the maintenance fee is considered still very high for a walkup apartment (this is on the 4th floor) and there is a monthly assessment of $200-300 that run for a few years.&nbsp; With maintenance fees and assessment fees this high, I would prefer a building with an elevator and a private garden! And isn&#039;t 82nd St quite noisy with the Q33 and Q32 buses and cars running along it? Also PS212 is not as strong a school as PS69 in my opinion.<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/building/34_39-82-street-jackson_heights/41

				Actually, the maintenance is pretty in line with other two bedrooms. The Colonials&#039; units are 1000 square feet and in our building at least the maintenance is under $800. And we&#039;ve never had an assessment since we&#039;ve been there. (But of course that depends on the particular building--they are six individual cooperatives.)<br /><br />When we were buying our choice basically came down to an apartment in a building with a communal garden where an in-unit washer-dryer was not allowed, versus the one we chose--with in-unit laundry and no garden. It wasn&#039;t a hard choice for us, because having a garden was not worth having to schlep to the basement every week to use the shared laundry facilities. <br /><br />I think the bottom line is it all comes down to personal preferences. I love that Jackson Heights is famous for the coops&#039; gardens, and I&#039;m sure there are pleasures associated with those gardens that I underestimate. But they are not a priority for us. I&#039;d rather be in either a fully public park or a completely private garden. (Alas, the latter option is not feasible given the price of real estate in NYC.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Lastly, while it&#039;s true, Hot2015, that 82nd street can be noisy from time to time when traffic backs up and people start honking, the nice thing is both bedrooms are in the back, so you never hear the street when you&#039;re trying to sleep.

				I still think the monthly maintenance fees for the Colonials are high compared to the Greystones and Hampton Court walkup apartments, for example, and these coops have interior gardens and I believe some even allow washers and dryers! The one I highlighted is on the 4th floor and is still $777 (Colonials) - I thought the higher the floor in a walkup, the lower the maintenance fee.<br /><br />Have you been to 82nd St near the Colonials during morning dropoffs and afternoon pickups at PS 212? It&#039;s hectic and noisy.<br /><br />The Saybrook and Belvedere with 2 BR and 1 bath with 1K square footage have maintenance fees in the 700-800s and those buildings have an elevator and garden. Granted, those apts are priced in mid-high 500K (550-595K) vs 420-440K in the Colonials. Where do you see the 50% markup?<br />

				Agree that stairs are good exercise--the problem comes when you develop arthritis or bad knees and are stuck having to walk many stairs up and down. When we moved to JH we were in our 50s, and it seemed crazy to consider a walkup building unless it was a ground floor apartment. As you get older, the chances increase that you might have trouble negotiating stairs at some point.

				Amused by the conversation I started here. When you are young, you don&#039;t even think about this sort of thing and you assume that things like painful joints, or broken bones, or surgeries will never, ever happen to you. In fact, you don&#039;t think about it till it happens and then it comes as a shock that such a thing COULD in fact happen to forever-young you. I already had that in mind when shopping for our JH apartment, but later it was underlined when I met a new neighbor who told me she moved from the Greystones because she had broken a bone or something and no longer wanted to live in a walkup. I&#039;d feel the same if I were to move to a house--I&#039;d want minimal or no stairs at this point in my life, now in my 60s. And yes, I do work out at a gym, but that&#039;s entirely different from having to deal with stairs on a daily basis no matter what the state of my body.

				Wait!&nbsp; Is there anyone young on this forum?<br /><br />Or only older folk with knee issues?<br /><br />(I&#039;m 30-something)<br /><br />I&#039;m figuring walk ups can be starter apartments...for young folks...and that&#039;s why they might be less expensive...and when folks get old and their knees collapse...they move on...<br /><br />Also...a genuine question...<br /><br />What happens in the subway? For older folks with knee problems?&nbsp; Does the subway become out of bounds for them?&nbsp; So many stairs in the subway system...and often escalators are in disrepair, I notice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thinking about it now...The whole of NYC ain&#039;t easy for knees-afflicted individuals!<br /><br />

				at the prices we&#039;re seeing these days I wouldn&#039;t buy a walkup higher than 2nd floor.<br /><br />It&#039;s just an inconvenience, not only for yourself, but for deliveries and guests and if you have kids, a bike, stroller, groceries... moving in and out...etc.<br /><br />and of course when you&#039;re older it poses more issues.

				^^^Knee issues and arthritis have been on my mind since my early 30s. By the time I was 38, my parents had four knee replacements.

				Yes, subway stairs will eventually become an issue--and then there are buses and of course now Ubers and all the other car services. Still better than having to drive everywhere at that older age, so the city still has a big advantage over suburban living for older people. As for WeWork--in my new job I&#039;m working at one. I had no idea there were so many of these places all over NYC now--lots of WeWorks and also other similar co-working spaces. It just makes so much sense really. Shared working spaces and living spaces--I do think that is the wave of the future, and I&#039;m all for it.

				Well this thread took an interesting turn! I&#039;m glad it ultimately circled back to the factors people prioritize when looking for apartments. For us, having lots of natural light, space, and character in a great location at a reasonable price were the deciding factors, which is why we chose the Colonials. Fortunately, we are both young to be able to get our groceries (and daughter) up the five flights without much trouble, though I recognize that is a challenge for many.

				I was curious about elevators and so I read this online...<br /><br />As a very rough guide, the cost of a full-scale elevator upgrade will run roughly $15,000 per floor, per elevator. Your agreement with the contractor should include a regular preventive maintenance program, which usually entails twice-per-month visits and servicing. (Maintenance programs are not included in the upgrade cost.)...<br /><br />And it says that elevators must be upgraded every 25 years or so.<br /><br />Could that be right?<br /><br />Wow, not cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suppose that&#039;s why maintenance for elevator buildings is always so much higher than walk-ups...<br /><br />Anyway, I suppose in life you pay for what you get.

				Abcdefghijk etc...you seem to really, really,really want to confirm that it&#039;s much cheaper to live in a walk-up, and that these low maintenance figures I and another person are citing must be misleading. No, in fact, there have been just a few assessments--two or three-in the six years we have been here--totaling (over six years) maybe $2000 tops, when something came up that needed some extra funding--and it was not anything related to the elevator, which is serviced and maintained via the maintenance fees. The $650 maintenance figure includes a portion that goes directly to the reserve fund every month.

We have a super who gets a free apartment in exchange for cleaning duties mostly--and the management we do ourselves. It&#039;s a thrifty model that so far has worked out well for us. No big assessments, no big expenses, and the maintenance has gone up just once (by $50) in the six years we have lived here. We came from a building in Manhattan with hundreds of apartments and a full staff--so maintenance there was around $1300. We saved a lot by moving to JH and into one of the small garden coops. And we chose one that does have an elevator.

				When I was looking for an apartment, I was sorely tempted by some of the low maintenance fees I was seeing at the walk ups. But we decided that unless it was a first floor apartment, it wasn&#039;t a wise decision in the long run given a family history of serious arthritis issues (on both sides). And from a safety perspective, I wasn&#039;t excited about a first floor unit. <br /><br />If you take a look, you&#039;ll find some elevator buildings in the neighborhood have pretty low maintenance. Most seem to be post-war buildings.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a two bedroom on a higher floor for $763 <br />http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/35-51-85-St-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-200931874][url]http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/35-51-85-St-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-200931874 &nbsp;(http://[url)[/url]<br /><br />Here&#039;s a three bedroom at Southridge with even lower maintenance. <br />http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/33-05-90th-St-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-198805866 (http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/33-05-90th-St-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-198805866)<br /><br />Here&#039;s a two bedroom at Washington Plaza with a maintenance for less than $900 (which surprised me to find. I&#039;m guessing the second bedroom is itty bitty and it&#039;s a low floor)<br />http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/73-12-35th-Ave-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-200517928 (http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/73-12-35th-Ave-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-200517928)<br /><br />Here&#039;s a junior 4 with maintenance less than $750<br />http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/77-11-35th-Ave-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-198042635 (http://www.mlsli.com/homes-for-sale/77-11-35th-Ave-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372-198042635)

				I wonder how low your maintenance payments might be if you didn&#039;t have an elevator, or stairs?&nbsp; Of course, it may be a pain in the neck climbing up and down the fire escape everyday.........especially on a cold, snowy day........and with a new TV in hand.........with a broken arm!

				I’ve been watching this string get very off topic and don’t love to see the name of our building as the subject of a string of mostly negative comments. Forgive the long reply, but I wanted to share my experience with The Colonials, which is the original subject of this string.<br /><br />We live in The Colonials, this is our 3rd co-op purchase. We bought here 3 years ago. We are not rookies, we are middle-aged and our knees are ok so far.<br /><br />Having bought 2 times before in 80+ unit co-ops in Brooklyn with garden areas, we had all of the questions that have come up in this string and can answer most of them now that we live there.<br /><br />Why are the prices so low?<br /><br />They are walk-ups, on a bus/fire dept route and share their block with a school. Yes, yes…yes.<br /><br />It is true, walk-ups aren’t for everyone, but one good way to stay in great shape is to live in one, as the elderly and pregnant tenants here will tell you. I haven’t noticed the 6 children born and living in our building whining about the stairs either.<br /><br />With this NYC real estate explosion you do see a lot more buyers who are not looking for their “forever” apartment. They are priced out of Brooklyn and they are buying a place that they will move on from within 7-10 years. Family histories of arthritis are not so much of a deal breaker any more. <br /><br />A 5th floor walk-up in The Colonials, for a couple who wants top floor living, wants a home office or wants to start a family is a steal in this market and this neighborhood. <br /><br />The schools &amp; the busses?<br /><br />We can hear children saying the Pledge of Allegiance in the school yard in the mornings, and we can hear them playing at recess for a half an hour, but that is the extent of it.<br /><br />There are a lot of city busses, but that is true on 81st + 83rd&nbsp; streets too.&nbsp; Louder are the cars blaring music that you could hear on any block. Louder are the planes you&#039;d be bothered with much more so if you live in the 70’s blocks around here.<br /><br /><br />The lack of “garden” space?<br /><br />The Colonials don’t have the gorgeous courtyard gardens this neighborhood is known for. Their “garden” areas out back are modest, with one or two picnic tables.&nbsp; Children play and families and neighbors grill their suppers and eat together. They are actually quite heavily used in this regard, so don’t count them out for “outdoor space.” <br /><br />I think you will find, as we found living in larger co-ops with gardens, that the garden spaces have rules and are for quiet, reflective activities, not playing and grilling.&nbsp; In many ways, the outdoor spaces in The Colonials are more family friendly. <br /><br />Note, the houses on 83rd street, behind The Colonials are 2 stories tall, so the gardens have great sunlight as do the apartments. It is also pretty quiet back there which is great for sleeping.<br /><br /><br />Building Finances?<br /><br />It is true, the Colonials are each run separately, so&nbsp; one building may have better finances than the next.<br />They are small co-ops, just 10 units, so the cost of building repairs is covered by fewer people and can add up to more per head. <br /><br />We have experienced roof and brickwork repairs, which didn’t add up to a lot of extra cost, ultimately. Assessments are preferred to raising the maintenance in nearly all co-ops.<br /><br /><br />The Maintenence?<br /><br />For 2 bedrooms The Colonials have average maintenance, not high, not low.<br />Our building is self-managed, it works fine. It is wise to get along with your neighbors, as you will have to go to them with any problems you are having, not a management company.<br /><br />Keep in mind most Brooklyn and Queens properties have not been reassessed since the real estate explosion. Our maintenance costs are determined largely by property taxes that are based on property values on record. The records are old. When the values are reassessed and the property taxes increase, I think it is safe to say we can all look forward to maintenance increases across Queens and Brooklyn.<br /><br /><br />

				...one more note on why the prices are so low, which I think is useful :<br /><br />In our building alone, 2 tenants in their 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s passed away over the last 5 years.<br />Their units sold at very low prices, because their units were in need of complete upgrades.<br />There are many long-time, elderly tenants on this block living in The Colonials.

That changed with Gen X as it&#039;s been defined by low birth rate years, but that doesn&#039;t really change that generations within a family have been historically separated by on average about 20 years. Using the typical understanding of what a generations is, Boomers are typically defined as 1946-1965; Gen X is 1966-1985 (even if &quot;generational consultants&quot; have tried to define it as ending earlier). After Gen X because the consultants have changed the definition of a generation to include cultural and economic influences, the dates start to shift, but if you use the 20 year span, Millennials are 1986-2005 and Gen Z is 2006-2025. However you define it though, the oldest members of Generation Z are either teenagers graduating high school now or college kids.
