					The whole equation doesn&#039;t make sense to me. &nbsp;Low volume (and low margin stores) should not equal high rents. &nbsp;I&#039;m not questioning your friend&#039;s research - I just don&#039;t understand how such a market is sustainable. &nbsp;If JH residential apartment rents were higher, people wouldn&#039;t rent the apartments and would live elsewhere in the city, creating vacancy and leading to lower residential rents.<br /><br />On the other hand, 37th avenue doesn&#039;t appear to be low volume to my untrained eye and perhaps the dollar stores have a higher profit margin than I might guess. &nbsp;I&#039;ve never taken an economics class, but there must be a demand for the rents to remain high and there must be potential profit - at least for some types of stores - for there to be demand.

					And Sunday is the easiest day BY FAR to find parking - probably because the meter rules are suspended on the commercial streets.&nbsp; Even in the 70&#039;s finding a spot is typically a cinch on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; Weekend evenings are another story.<br /><br />Parking difficulties are all relative though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t actually own a car these days (just borrow one from time to time), but I once had a car for 2 months while living in Manhattan. The residential streets there were generally alternate side, with two cleaning windows per week on each side (i.e. one side Mon/Wed, the other side Tues/Thurs).&nbsp; I lived in walking distance to my office and used to take lunch in my car two days a week from 11:30 to 1pm during the street sweeping so that I didn&#039;t have to move my car 4 days in a row (and spend 1/2 hour or more each evening looking for a new spot).

					In addition to the other daycare locations mentioned, there is also Rainbowland by Travers Park.&nbsp; It is cheaper than Little Elms, but they don&#039;t take babies under 8 months of age (and they group 8-18 month olds together).&nbsp; Little Elms on the other hand starts young - maybe 6 weeks? - and groups the non-mobile infants together.&nbsp; My wife and I have a 3 month old and currently have family helping out during the day, but we are planning to make the transition to daycare when our daughter is around 6 months old.

					I used to run along 34th avenue between broadway and junction blvd, which has a bike lane (these days i&#039;m lazy).&nbsp; It&#039;s about 1.5 miles each way or 3 miles roundtrip.&nbsp; I used to head out around 6am when traffic was light and run in the bike lane, which was great to avoid pedestrians on the sidewalk and there aren&#039;t many bikes out that early.&nbsp; I always tried to be curtious and move to the sidewalk if I saw bikes coming my way (I run opposite the bikes and traffic) and never got any dirty looks, but have always been curious what bikers think of runners using the bike lanes.

					I&#039;m on board with those yearning for improved quality of life. &nbsp;Some parts of J.Heights are just beautiful and a big part of what sucked me in 5 years ago when I moved here. &nbsp;But other parts are often so dirty and unpleasant - namely the areas closer to the subway. &nbsp;That dumpster on the west side of 75th between Roosevelt and 37th avenue that is right on the walk to the subway and out most mornings is perhaps the worst consistently bad smelling thing (during the summer) I&#039;ve ever encountered. &nbsp;My wife and I love taking long walks around the neighborhood, but rarely do we venture south of 35th avenue and we increasingly walk north of Northern for variety (though 34th avenue in the 70&#039;s &amp; 80&#039;s is still my favorite including some of the adjoining blocks). &nbsp;I&#039;ve lived in Hell&#039;s Kitchen, Manhattan&#039;s Chinatown, the East Village, and Williamsburg - and I don&#039;t mind gritty as an interesting change of pace, but our neighborhood just has the wrong kind of &#039;grit&#039; for me I guess.<br /><br />With regards to comparisons to Williamsburg or Astoria, Jackson Heights may be missing some of the cool restaurants and outdoor cafes, but the architecture in Jackson Heights (north of 37th Avenue at least) is so much nicer. &nbsp;Williamsburg to me was one of the ugliest places I&#039;ve ever lived. &nbsp;I work in Manhattan so I can get my fix of trendy shops and restaurants there (not that I&#039;d mind a few more here). &nbsp;I&#039;d just rather my neighborhood at home be a little cleaner. &nbsp;I mean, littering is against the law, right?

					Went in earlier today.&nbsp; Produce section had good selection and GREAT prices.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if this is just an introductory thing since they just opened, but will definitely go back to find out.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t look around rest of the store too much but it was pretty clean and nice.

					I think the transit ranking is the biggest crock, but if you look at how the other queens neighborhoods stack up (change the priority of every other category to zero) it appears to do the ranking based on how far the neighborhood is from Manhattan.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty narrow minded.

					i use time warner, but i get flyers in the mail from RCN all the time (and the offers seem to get cheaper and cheaper). &nbsp;from the flyers it doesn&#039;t seem like it has to be building wide, but i&#039;ve never really looked into switching so i don&#039;t know. &nbsp;i did look into verizon fios 1.5 yrs ago, but they still hadn&#039;t run their fiber optic cables through JH. &nbsp;that may have changed by now, so may be worth checking them out too.
