				JJ Garden (located at 75-21 31 St Avenue Jackson Hts, NY 11370) serves amazing authentic Chinese food with reasonable price, and it offers FREE delivery. Its Peking duck is delicious and fantastic, and they serve different style of noodles including cellophone, thin Cantonese noodles, lo mein, chow fun, and mei fun. JJ Garden serves many delicious appetizers including B.B.Q Honey Spare Ribs, and Roast Duck. Additionally, their Dim Sum menu includes popular items such as Crystal Shrimp Dumpling, and Juicy Little Pork Buns. Finally, they serve Spa Menu with dishes specially prepared for health-conscious diners, steamed without oil, cornstarch nor salt. This is one of few authentic Chinese restaurants with great dishes in Jackson Heights, NY area.<br /><br />Previously, you can only order food from the restaurant by calling JJ Garden by phone or going to the restaurant to order your food. Now, we can download an easy-to-use app called &quot;mifan&quot; from Apple Store or Google Play on our smart phones to check out JJ Garden&#039;s menu, and place our orders for delicious, authentic Chinese dishes for pick-up or delivery using the &quot;mifan&quot; app. This app is so cool that it allows us to track our order status, to see whether it is ready for pick up, or if our food is out for delivery to our place. For additional information about the &quot;mifan&quot; app, visit www.eatmifan.com

				While I am sure you think your restaurant is the best I don&#039;t. We have had both takeout and dined in many times over the years. The servers are very sweet and when you eat in the portions are huge. Takeout was horrible the last time we ordered. No flavor, took forever, missing items etc. It is a shame because JJ gardens has a large space for dining in but it doesn&#039;t wow us. Sorry George.

				George, you should really outsource the spamming to someone who does it well. the same post, word for word, as a newly registered &quot;reviewer&quot; on Yelp? surely, you could have tried a little harder than that.

				likewise, all kidding aside, JJ Garden has been my go to delivery place for ages. consistently good shrimp dishes and - an unusual offering for the area - chicken dumplings, made with white meat that somehow retains some juice.

				This is not a personal recommendation because I&#039;ve never been, but I have read about <strong>Sweet Yummy House</strong> in Elmhurst.<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/sweet-yummy-house-serves-up-sichuan-taiwanese-style-6437499<br />http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/michelins-bib-gourmand-awards-elmhurst-s-chinese-and-thai-restaurants-7767489<br /><br />(http://images1.villagevoice.com/imager/u/745xauto/6437498/8575649.0.jpg)

				I am partial to Uncle Zhou&#039;s<br /><br />the &#039;dial oil noodles&#039; are delish AND&nbsp; if you like your dumplings robust, they have good ones! the &quot;cold appetiser tray&quot; is lipsmackeroony.<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/dining/reviews/uncle-zhou-in-queens-nyc-restaurant-review.html?_r=0<br />http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2012/09/slurped-knife-peel-noodles-uncle-zhou-elmhurst.html<br />http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/uncle-zhou-restaurant/<br />

				Is there anywhere in the Elmhurst area to get Shanghai style soup dumplings, or do you have to go to Flushing for that?

				Sweet Yummy is a very good Sichuan restaurant. Not quite up to the level of Spicy and Tasty in Flushing, but definitely very good. Their lunch specials are a great bargain, most of them around seven dollars.

				Thanks for all the suggestions, I look forward to trying them out.&nbsp; I must say, though, I wish there were good Sichuan, Hunan and/or Cantonese places closer to me than a 20-minute walk away.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the very few things that makes me a bit sad about where I live.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll just have to make a habit of hanging out in Flushing more!

				Also in Elmhurst, Uncle Zhou has fantastic noodle soups. I like the knife-shaved noodles the best. It received a Michelin &quot;Bib Gourmand&quot; award along with Sweet Yummy House and Zabb Elee. (Last year Ayada got the award too.)
