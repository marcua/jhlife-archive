				We&#039;ve been buying our trees from the fruit/veggie market located on the corner of 78th and 37th Avenue for the past few years.&nbsp; If you live nearby, they&#039;ll schedule free delivery for you.&nbsp; All you have to do is add a nice tip to the delivery guy.&nbsp; Have also had positive experiences with the guys that set up shop near the florist next door to Jahn&#039;s also on 37th Avenue. <br /><br />The times that we&#039;ve purchased trees from the vendors along Northern Blvd. near Home Depot, we&#039;ve been attracted by the signs advertising 6 ft. trees for $19.95.&nbsp; By the time we got home, we had spent $60 to $80 instead.&nbsp; Call us suckers!&nbsp; &nbsp;:embarassed:

				The corner of 78th and 37th usually has a great variety to choose from.&nbsp; The service is great as well.&nbsp; An employee/vendor assisted my family well.&nbsp; They were able to modify the tree for me and molded the trunk to shape into my stand at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I just picked up a tree at Fruitel on 78th and 37th Ave. yesterday- only $30. They were really friendly and tied up the tree for me. <br /><br />I just watered it and put some lights up and it looks great. Hopefully it doesn&#039;t dry out before Christmas&nbsp; :P
