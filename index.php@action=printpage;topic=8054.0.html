				Hi<br /><br />After living in Jackson Heights for one year, I&#039;ve decided to buy a coop in Jackson Heights. The most difficult part is to negotiate the price as in many situations my buyer agent will not be represented due to the exclusive listing. If I&#039;d like to use the the existing sales for the comparison,&nbsp; what year should I be using? <br /><br />I understand that the price in Jackson Heights moves differently from Manhattan (the streeteasy condo index can not help me) and&nbsp; the price trend of coop is different from condos and houses. After studying the same layout of the apartments sold in the same buildings of the past 10 years, it seemed to me that the price goes up significantly from 2003-2008, and decreases significantly at 2009, 2010, and then comes back to 2011, and 2012.&nbsp; It seemed that&nbsp; the coop price in Jackson Heights come back to the pre-Peak level (say 2006), I&#039;m wondering if this is a valid observation, can you guys give some input on the price trend of coop in jackson heights?<br /><br />Thanks, a first time jackson heights coop purchaser.<br /><br />I realize that&nbsp; the majority of the apartments in Jackson Heights COOP are Junior 4 or one bedroom apartment, which can have a lot of comp sales and more or less are easy to determine the fair market price. However, there are very few real two bedroom apartments where the second bedroom (11x15 or 13x13) should be just a tiny bit smaller than the master bedroom (12x18), is this going to be 10% price more than junior 4 where the second bedroom is more like 8x14 or even 8x12?&nbsp; how about an extra half bath (another 5% more) or an extra full bath (another 10% more)?<br />&nbsp;

				When making comps for my clients, I generally like to use the most recent sales as my basis for coming up with an offer price. Usually I&#039;ll look back six months to a year at most, though I&#039;ll also include older listings if there&#039;s a specific reason to do so.<br /><br />Another important thing to look at is the Price Per Square foot. Sometimes coop listings won&#039;t include this, but through some careful sleuthing you can often find a similar apartment in the building that will have it listed from a previous sale. I also examine the maintenance per square foot. If this number in significantly higher than other properties in the area, it may be an indication of financial distress in the building. I also look at the percent difference between the listed price and the actual sale price, and the amount of time the apartment was on the market. If apartments are closing at or around their listing price, and quickly, it indicates that we may have less room to negotiate. <br /><br />Regardless, I think that your experience here speaks to a post I made yesterday. <br /><br />Sellers agents not cobroking their listings brings buyers who are unrepresented. This does a huge disservice to not only the buyer, but the seller as well.<br /><br />Buying a home is one of single greatest investments that a person can make. Why would anyone want to go into a situation where they are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a home, and yet are not represented by a competent real estate professional? It doesn&#039;t make sense to me. <br /><br />Regardless, feel free to read through the post I made yesterday.<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0<br /><br />And feel free to ask any more questions! <br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Aram<br /><br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br />aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com<br />www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian

				Thanks Aram the reply.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, your method is quite good to find a fair market price for a junior 4 or one bedroom apartment as there are many recent sales data available. <br />Also for the public listed sale such as mls or streeteasy, it is easy to check the price history. However, for the exclusive listing, the trace of the price history has lost.<br /><br />I have to say if co-brokering is going to result in a higher price, then co-brokering is definitely a good choice for the buyer, but a good choice for the seller.&nbsp; The buyer just needs to do a little bit of more homework when he is unrepresented to get a good price.<br /><br />The real challenge is to price real two bedroom apartments, or with extra half bath or an extra full bath, which do not come to market frequently as in a typical six story building, there is probably one apartment with this size on each floor.&nbsp; The dollar per square foot in a real two bedroom is definitely higher than a junior 4 in the same building, but the question is how much the premium should be.<br /><br /><br />

				Exactly! Determining how much of a premium should be paid for things like an extra full bath vs extra half bath, and things of this nature can often be more difficult to ascertain than coming up with comps for a standard 1br or 2br apartment. I once did comps for a client in Manhattan who was buying a condo with a large balcony. It was very interesting to see how much of a premium was paid for a balcony. I believe at the time, it was less than one would have thought, and we were able to use that info to competitively and aggressively negotiate with the seller. I saved my client over $100,000 on that deal.<br /><br />However, I will also say that with details like these when there is not a lot of closed sales data, it often comes down to an &quot;educated guess.&quot; One can look at data from other neighborhoods. For example, in Sunnyside, or Woodside, how much of a premium does an extra half bath vs full bath get?<br /><br />Perhaps those percentages will give you more data with which to make an &quot;educated guess&quot; on what to offer.<br /><br />Regarding your statement about unrepresented buyers, I stand by my statement that it is beneficial for both the buyer and the seller to have the buyer be represented. <br /><br />If you disagree, then that&#039;s great! Certainly people buy apartments in NYC all the time and are unrepresented. But I do think that there is much more involved with buying a COOP in NYC than most people think. And I can&#039;t see any negative to having responsive, intelligent and diligent broker who deals with sales on a day to day basis on your side.<br /><br />Aram<br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br />aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com<br />www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian<br />

				Thanks for your suggestion of looking into other buildings to find out the premium. <br /><br />My previous statement is that a HIGHER price introduced by co-brokering is not good for the buyer.<br />The buyer and the seller are always on the two sides. A higher price is always good for the seller and a lower price is always good for the buyer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would have to say co-brokering may introduce more market efficiency due to the transparency and the fair market price can be determined very quickly so that both of the seller and buyer can have a good idea of the fair market price to have the sale closed quickly.

				I still respectfully disagree!<br /><br />Let&#039;s say that the median price for an apartment in the neighborhood is $300,000, and that listing brokers are only getting paid 3%. <br /><br />Now let&#039;s say there&#039;s a massive uprising in the neighborhood among sellers and they demand that listing agents start cobroking. They agree to pay an additional 3% for a buyers broker but increase listed prices for their apartments by 3% to make up for this. So now the price becomes $309,000. And let&#039;s say that they want to have a bit more of a cushion, so they increase the price to $315,000, or $320,000.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s say that your buyers broker, through negotiation, is able to get 5% off the price for you. That&#039;s $16,000 off. And you end up closing at $304,000.<br /><br />We&#039;re talking about a $4,000 difference on the price of the apartment. If it were up to me, and I was investing $60,000 (20% down), I&#039;d be willing to take out an extra $4000 on my loan so that I could be represented by someone who is experienced.<br /><br />Now obviously scenarios can easily be made where there is a greater savings, but in general, I would say that the difference is often less than one would assume. <br /><br />At our firm, we go over each offer with the partners of the firm. Often times I&#039;ll discuss it with my managers at great length. We all work as a team. The two partners of the firm are Harvard and Columbia grads who both worked in investment banking for years. They have a great deal of financial savvy, to say the least. We hyper analyze each deal to make sure that we&#039;re coming in with an offer that will get our clients the apartment they love at the best price possible. <br /><br />My strong belief is that for a buyer, it is certainly worth it to have this kind of team on your side when making the single greatest investment of your life. <br /><br />Aram<br />______________________________<br />Aram Bajakian<br />Senior Associate Broker<br />Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate<br />Residential Sales &amp; Rentals<br />341 West 38th Street, 10th Floor<br />New York, NY 10018<br />O: 212.864.4555<br />C: 917.348.0704<br />F: 212.706.2939<br />aram.bajakian@coopercooper.com<br />www.CooperCooper.com/AramBajakian<br /><br />

				Comping in Jackson Heights can be tricky as there are units that on paper fit the profile but may differ in condition by a mile. Unless you get visuals with the data it&#039;s hard to see it as a true comp. If you are buying a renovated unit, it&#039;s important that you find renovated units to compare your purchase to, and be sure to make proper adjustments for the floor and monthly maintenance. Same goes for fixers (which can be tricky because boards may take issue with low sales price) - find similar fixers to compare them to. My partner and I specialize in renovated units, and go to great lengths to find comps in order to supply them to the appraiser later on...<br /><br />With every building that you get interested in find out who it&#039;s managed by, and call the management to get the list of recent sales - MANY OF THEM ARE NOT PROPERLY RECORDED IN PUBLIC RECORDS - don&#039;t ask me why, but it still helps to see public records on a building before you consider bidding on one. Management keeps completer records, and they will assist in giving you an idea as to what the range the unit can sell for (hopefully you&#039;ll get someone friendly :). <br /><br />Having a buyer broker always helps in this regard, and I agree with Aram that it&#039;s not always cost efficient, especially in a non-cooperative deal. But getting a deal to stick is at the best price is understanding exactly how much leverage you have in the negotiation and how far you can push the envelope not to upset the coop board. <br /><br />I say use every resource available, get as much information as you can to raise your comfort level, and proceed forward.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br />www.jacksonheightslistings.com<br />

				Note that to make a fully informed decision as to the relative value of units of comparable size/amenities in different buildings, you (or your attorney) should take steps to become informed about the coop&#039;s finances, particularly the amount and terms of the underlying mortgage and any outstanding lines of credit or other encumbrances on property.

				Higher than average maintenance fees will often (though not always) reflect a larger than usual underlying mortgage.&nbsp; In most coops, I would say that debt service on the mortgage and property taxes are the two big ticket items.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note that a high underlying mortgage is not necessarily a reason not to buy -- just something to be generally aware of given that a building with a higher mortgage will have relatively less equity in the property.&nbsp; A higher underlying mortgage is also slightly riskier in the sense that if there is a maintenance default by a significant number of shareholders (or a single shareholder with multiple units, such as a sponsor) this will put a greater financial burden on the other shareholders, who will have to pick up the slack.&nbsp; <br /><br />When evaluating the building&#039;s underlying debt, you should consider this figure in the context of the number of units in the building -- for example a $2,000,000 mortgage on a building with 125 units would be a reasonable debt load.&nbsp; The same amount in a building with say 50 units would be more of a concern.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, the amount of the underlying mortgage is less of an issue now than it was back in the 90s, when property values were so much lower leaving some buildings with very little equity in the property (this was also a time when many buildings faced a real risk of sponsor default).&nbsp; <br />

				This is certainly a fun subject to flex a real estate intellectual muscle &nbsp;:) but it&#039;s no secred that all buyers share the concern of a secure investment and some kind of sense as to where their montlies are headed after purchase. &nbsp;If they start high their exposure is certainly higher. High maintenance is not only a red flag but a buyer repellant in most cases especially in a marketplace where lower maintenances are generally expected. <br /><br />There is a difference in several building rules such as sublet or pet policies, which ultimately affect them on resale. It&#039;s also NOT common for buyers to retain attorneys before there is an accepted offer or a contract, so having a broker familiar with the buildign and a skill set to do some due diligence to provide an opinion helps at least in the pre-screening stages. The attorneys always have the last say in NY anyway. A lot of information is public and we have complete data on 27 prime buildings on our site alone: http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/buildings/<br /><br />We put up more updates as we do deals or have to repull information on each individual building. We also had our partner in lending screen them for financing approval, and even though bank approvals have expiration dates, they look quite strong. <br /><br />What I would do if I were the buyer, I would select the section of Jackson Heights that I want to be in, draw a target parameter, identify the buildings in it and have them all researched, and then look for individual units in the pre-screened buildings. It will save A LOT of time and will ultimately raise buyer confidence. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br />www.jacksonheightslistings.com

				Hi Armen<br /><br />I admire your efforts to make fancy pages on the web site at www.jacksonheightslistings.com. Somehow, the trick of misleading information or stretching the facts too much turns me away immediately. For example, you have listed the apartment 35-36 76th Street, #323 as a two bedroom apartment.&nbsp; Anybody looking at the floor can only consider it as &quot;ONE&quot; bedroom apartment. The dinning area can not be considered a separate bedroom (the flex room is such a fancy word). Even for a junior 4 in most jackson heights coop buildings, the dinning room that can be also served as a bedroom has its own walls and its closet and the kitchen has its own window. <br /><br />The floor plan is attached here so other people may examine it. I am hoping the reply does not get eliminated and you may revise your list to make my claim sounds unfounded and this is the last post I will comment on you web listing.

				I agree that you should look at the last 6 months and no more than 1 year when researching comparable apartments sold in the area. This is what appraisers do. I know this can be difficult if the apartment you are doing the research for is not typical of the neighborhood but you should be able to get an idea.<br /><br />I find the residential reports from REBNY to be very helpful in giving an idea of the sales trend in a particular neighborhood. They can be found here: http://www.ny1residential.com/Content/Content.aspx?ContentID=1405995 (http://www.ny1residential.com/Content/Content.aspx?ContentID=1405995)<br /><br />They do a good job of breaking the information down from very general (all sales - coops, condos, single family homes, etc.) to more specific, having a report for each type. <br /><br />Unfortunately, I only see the first 2 quarters listed for 2012, I&#039;m not sure when the 3rd and 4th will be posted.<br /><br />Also, if there is a specific building you are interested in, you can research city records easily here: http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/Coverpage.dll/index (http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/Coverpage.dll/index)<br /><br />As mentioned above, this information may not be up to date, and if possible, it would be a good idea to contact the building&#039;s management company for information on recent sales.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also found this site helpful: http://www.redfin.com/<br /><br />Although it does not cover all of the city, it does cover Queens, including Jackson Heights. You can research both current listings and past sales in the neighborhood.

				Thanks Matt for the information<br /><br />In terms of recent sale data, the best resource is the department of finance http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/rolling_sales_data.shtml where you can download all of the sales data for from 2003-2012. I believe that&nbsp; is where Daniel Karatzas obtained the data to work on his report (http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/). For any one who wants to buy coop in jackson heights, he needs to seriously read Daniel Karatzas&#039; report (He just released this morning for Q4 2012). If you want to play the data like me, downloading all of the data from the department of finance and extract the data in your area to study them, that&#039;s where I found the price trend in my first post.<br /><br />For an average person,&nbsp; the acris mentioned by Matt http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/Coverpage.dll/index is the best place to go or read Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report.<br /><br />redfin is a little bit useless for price comp as a lot of apartments in jackson heights are exclusives and are not even advertised there because the local realtors don&#039;t want co-brokering. I heard stories that only difficult sell apartments will be advertised at<br />redfin or mlsli. <br /><br />All of the these info can not help myself as&nbsp; there are very few apartments in that building with that size, so the sale history is almost nonexistent. Using the relative price premium of adding one bathroom or half bathroom compared to a junior 4 from the same building at nearby location is the only way to guess the price of the apartment I am interested in. <br /><br />

Most owners of these lines have gone through great effort to create custom doors in effort to transform them into guest bedrooms, offices or baby rooms. It&#039;s that property that&#039;s safely a one with an eat-in kitchen but understated, or a property that is being used in its current configuration as a flex 2 and obviously overstated as a 2 bed. As you know 1.5 bed is not an available search engine option :) Wish it was. In case of this unit, this flex bedroom functions as a baby room. We&#039;ve done our best to convey the propertie&#039;s descrition in the copy and by providing detailed visuals, including big bold FLEX 2 in the headline. It&#039;s priced and comped against 1 bedrooms. The suggestion of that section being used as a bedroom also came from the building&#039;s original plan which I will attach. The description of flex two that I found reads as follows: &quot;A Convertible 2-Bedroom or &quot;flex 2&quot; is a large 1-bedroom with a dining room or enough space to create a wall for a second bedroom.&quot; <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/?attachment_id=2946

I particularly used this idea a lot in Manhattan when I had college roommates who couldn&#039;t afford a true 2br. <br />They would take a 1br, put a wall in the living room and turn it into a 2br.<br /><br />And I think the intention is similar here. I know of a lot of families in JH that use this layout with the dining &quot;room&quot; as a baby room. It&#039;s a great option for people who may want some of the benefits of a 2br (separate room, some added privacy for guests, baby room) but can&#039;t afford a true 2br. <br /><br />Does that make sense?<br /><br />I too have often seen clients feel like this was misrepresentation, and I can certainly understand how it comes across that way. But by listing it as a 2br, it opens up options that some people might not have initially considered if it was listed as a straight 1br. &nbsp;

As far as I know, they do post on MLS and are willing to work with a buyer&#039;s broker. The way things have been done in the past in the neighborhood appear to be changing.

				Hi Matt,<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I can post Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report unless I can first obtain his permission or he can post it by himself. &nbsp;Daniel Karatzas is a well regarded local realtor as other people (for example, Shelby2 just confirmed) in this forum have said. He only emails me once in three month for his real estate report and never emails me anything else.<br /><br />The floor plans of many of the well known buildings in Jackson Heights can be found at the Columbia real estate brochure <br />http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/neighborhoods/view/QN28<br />In this way, you will precisely know the layout of almost all apartments of the building. As I said, combining rolling sales data and the building floor plan is not for an average joe, that is where Daniel Karatzas&#039;s report can help you.<br /><br />I will check out the RENBY later.<br /><br />Regarding redfin or mlsli or other big companies, you have exactly restated what I said: their price are over inflated and these apartments are difficult sells.<br /><br />Reply to Armen&#039;s comments, the junior 4 (larger than your stated flex 2 or whatever) can be found in Jackson Heights for around 250K even at redfin, mlsli or streeteasy or NYT times. &nbsp;Some shady brokers in craigslist can even stretch your listing to be as a three bedroom as one can wall off the living-room as a separate bedroom. I believe most buyers in Jackson Heights want to live like a family. Do we seriously like to live like a dorm town in Manhattan so the brokers can jack up the price as high in Manhattan? &nbsp;If that happens, most family will go to other areas for example (Forest Hills, Rego Park, Elmhurst) to find real homes.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi jh_coop_buyer,<br /><br />That is a good idea to cross-reference the floor plans from Columbia&#039;s website with the rolling sales data. Keep in mind that the real estate brochures on Columbia&#039;s site are historical and the apartment configurations may have changed. These also leave out the current condition of the apartment and many do not list the floor plans with dimensions. Many of the local brokers will list on their websites apartments they have sold, leaving the original listing with photos but not listing the price the apartment sold at. You can cross-reference this information with the rolling data or with Acris.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8054.msg47135.html#msg47135">Quote from: jh_coop_buyer on January 21, 2013, 01:30:30 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Regarding redfin or mlsli or other big companies, you have exactly restated what I said: their price are over inflated and these apartments are difficult sells.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

If you are finding the information in the rolling data from the Dept. of Finance valuable then you must acknowledge that the information found on websites such as Redfin or StreetEasy are part of that data. The Dept. of Finance records all sales, regardless of what brokerages took part in the sale.<br /><br />I disagree that there is a difference in the listing prices of the large NY brokerages and the local brokers. I definitely have seen apartments listed for unusually high and low prices but these seem to be equally divided among both types of brokerages. I think this may have more to do with the individuals selling either believing their home is worth much more than it is (high asking price) or they really need to sell their home (low asking price). Although the brokers provide guidance, it is the seller that sets the price.<br /><br />If what you believe is true that there is a considerable difference in asking prices between the larger NY companies and the local brokers, then the opposite argument could be made: the local brokers are keeping the prices in the neighborhood artificially low. Good for the buyer, but not for the seller.<br /><br />Anyone reading this post can decide for themselves which information is most valuable for their needs.

My belief is that if a seller wants to sell quickly at a reasonable price, then he should go to a local broker to price it right. If a seller wants to maximize the profit, he wants to go to the big companies (who has no clues of the local market and just prices what the seller wants), but he needs to be patient and may wait a long time (maybe several yeas) for a non-market savy purchaser to buy his apartment as the big companies want to copy the Manhattan experience to jackson heights. I feel sorry for the non-market savy purchaser, who doesn&#039;t consider the re-sale price carefully. If the purchaser is going to stay at the apartment for more than ten years, everything is working for him.&nbsp; However, if the purchaser has to sell the apartment in several years down the road due to job move or bigger family size or better school for the kids, it will be very challenge to sell his apartment at the price he has bought, even worse, if the interest rate is increasing back to normal (say 6%) after the government stops keeping the interest artificially low,&nbsp; the price of the coop will probably be going to come down as fewer people are able to afford the mortgage. Is the first real estate bubble going to happen a second time?<br /><br />

Fair Housing practices dictate that as licensees we don&#039;t make a distinction in the familial status, same way as race, gender, profession etc... We qualify our buyers based on credit worthiness and the boards make the ultimate determination. <br /><br />I want to be clear that I see jh_coop_buyer&#039;s point of view, and that the presumption is that the price is being inflated by the marketing description. Let me assure you again, the asking price of the unit is exactly equal to the recent sales of a similar 1 bedroom unit in the same building, which my partner and I sold 4 units in the last year, and the highest sale of a one bedroom is attributed to another broker whom we highly respect. The work was done by a building approved contractor, and similar conversion was done in the unit one floor below and&nbsp; in one other listing we currently represent, so it&#039;s not an anomaly or an inflation by any measure. <br /><br />My advice to all buyers is - BUY. There are very qualified buyers coming into Jackson Heights with an average household income of $120,000-160,000, and inevitably you will see owners looking for higher premium for their apartments as the demand increases. And as long as the banks appraisals support the values, prices will rise. With the feds continuing to buy 40 billion dollars in mortgage loans from the agencies, the rates will continue to stay low continuing to aid the increase in values. <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br />www.jacksonheightslistings.com<br /><br />

If there is no deal, the buyer agent gets nothing.&nbsp; The buyer agent will try to close the deal as quick as possible, there is no motivation for him to negotiate the best price for the buyer.<br /><br />Any buyer should ride the rollercoaster before he makes a decision to buy.<br />http://www.flixxy.com/real-estate-prices.htm<br /><br />I was looking at the closed sale at redfin<br />http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-2G/home/20637289<br />The layout can be seen in the Columbia real estate brochure (http://nyre.cul.columbia.edu/items/view/44081)<br />or from http://www.redfin.com/NY/Jackson-Heights/7215-37th-Ave-11372/unit-5G/home/20630657 <br /><br />From the layout, Armen (agentarmen) and his friend Aram will list this as three bedroom two bathroom apartment since the dining room can be converted to a third bedroom. <br /><br />The owner of apartment 2G paid the price of&nbsp; 345000 in April 2008 (probably by following Armen&#039;s advice to always buy). <br />For some reasons he can not control (probably due to job relocation), in Sept 2012, he had to sell it for 285000, with a loss of 60000, adding the broker fee and closing costs of buying and selling and having to pay the maintenance fee for one year and a half for the apartment on the market. His total loss is at least 90,000.<br /><br />As I mentioned yesterday, if one has a very stable job (tenured professors, doctors and government jobs), he definitely should buy an apartment by taking advantage of the low interest rate as he can stay in the apartment forever. For the rest of us, we have to worry if job relocation or family size growth&nbsp; or a better school for the kids require us to move to another place, we need to consider carefully the re-sale price (on average, an American family moves home once in every 7 years).&nbsp; &nbsp;The low-interest rate of today will bite us several years down the road when the interest rate increases and the coop price comes down as fewer people can afford the mortgage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m still struggling whether I should keep renting for a couple of years and then jump to the market after the government stops buying mortgage bond to keep the interest rate artificially low. <br /><br />

It&#039;s actually quite important that other people reading this know that this is normal, and in fact GOOD!

				I&#039;ve also been thinking about buying since I&#039;m not satisfied with any of the rental postings in this neighborhood. I&#039;ve been on craigslist, trulia, zillow, the pictures are always depressing images of emptied out apartments vacated by owners who quickly found something better, and apparently, with no one too eager to take over. And boy are the postings repetitive! Every other ad is capitalized, with superlative adjectives. &quot;Beautiful! Going Fast! Stunning!&quot; (&quot;posted by owners&quot;, but scroll down, there&#039;s a fee) - can we say desperate with a capital &#039;D&#039; ?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been living here probably for the past 6 years and no closer to affording the *real* 2 bedrooms judging by these sale prices I&#039;ve seen, 350 - 600K, with mortgage on top of maintenance (i&#039;ve see 1200/month!! Can&#039;t residents pitch in to maintain the gardens to save some money?) will probably come out to a manhattan rental, defeating the purpose of living in Jackson Heights, which by the way, does not have the same restaurants or schools or businesses as park slope.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster about dangling a carrot and stick in the ad descriptions. Imagine my disappointment when I click a 2 bedroom ad, only to find out it&#039;s actually a ONE bedroom with a 50 square foot space&nbsp; &gt;:( for storage or dining or office, not fit for an adult to sleep in. I simply cannot put my elderly mother in a space like that to sleep in, so I think at least putting &quot;1.5&quot; in the text description field (where there&#039;s no preset pulldown menu for bedroom numbers) is at least more honest. <br /><br />Good luck to OP buyer. I think I should start looking at Jersey instead. Oy.

I know that many people actually prefer this type of layout for a Junior 4 because it creates a split bedroom. The bedroom is separate from the living area and other &quot;true&quot; bedroom and gives some privacy if it&#039;s being used as a guest room.<br /><br />It also allows parents to be active in the living area while the baby is sleeping - the kitchen provides a bit of a buffer. Junior 4 layouts where the &quot;4&quot; part is like an extension of the living room do not provide this privacy. Case in point, I have some friends in Brooklyn who recently had a baby, and converted the &quot;4&quot; part of their apartment to a nursery. The nursery opens up into the living room, and they can no longer watch TV after the baby goes to sleep. If they had an apartment similar to Armen&#039;s listing, this wouldn&#039;t be a problem. <br /><br />emkayoh, I have certainly seen some listings that say &quot;1.5 bedroom&quot; instead of Junior 4, or Flex 2. But again, Flex 2 is a standard term that&#039;s used in the city, so you&#039;ll probably see that more than 1.5 bedroom. <br /><br />And while I understand how it can be frustrating within your own search parameters, I know from experience that many clients would click on that same ad and have a positive experience. An &quot;A-Ha&quot; moment if you will, because they realize that they can have some of the benefits of a 2br at a lower price point. <br />As you stated, the fact remains that true 2brs are often much more expensive in JH. These flex 2&#039;s are great options for people who want to buy but can&#039;t afford a true two bedroom.<br />Someone stated in a previous post &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot; And while I understand that sentiment, unfortunately, not everyone has the means to spend $500K at the Chateau. <br /><br />Regardless, I feel like I&#039;m beating a dead horse here. <br /><br />jh_coop_buyer let us know where you end up!

				I was looking at 2 bedrooms for 3 people to live in, but cannot imagine how a flex 2 can allow 3 people- any board would definitely reject this idea. Besides, isn&#039;t converting a dining room into a bedroom against most co-op board rules? wouldn&#039;t you have to go through their converted bedroom to either reach the kitchen or living room? The concept sounds very odd. <br /><br />If anyone would rather rent their 2 bedroom (real 2 bedroom) co-op than sell, please give me a shout.

				I think the layout above could work for some people: 3 unrelated young adults, a family with a teenager, or an older parent living with a family. It depends on your needs. <br /><br />Every co-op board is different, but I know my board would NOT allow the use of a dining room for a bedroom.

				For a much more accurate assessment on sales and price trends in Jackson Heights there is one very reputable source. &nbsp;You can simply subscribe to my quarterly &quot;Jackson Heights Real Estate Report&quot; by going to www.jhrealestatereport.com and I will send you the fourth quarter 2012 report.<br /><br />My assessment: After three weak years, sales have started to increase, as have prices, although condition always plays an important role, and can have a strong effect on realized prices. &nbsp; &nbsp;With mortgage rates at historic lows, and the economy stabilizing, many renters are finally considering taking the plunge. &nbsp;Inventory across all property types is low, and with demand increasing, especially for larger units and houses, prices are likely to trend upward in 2013. <br /><br />By the way, per the REBNY report, I would be vary wary of price/square foot calculations, because I don&#039;t know who is reporting the square footage, especially for cooperatives.<br /><br />Please keep me in mind should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />646 285 7762

				Hi Daniel,<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realize that you contributed to JH Life. Your report was brought up earlier in this thread by jh_coop_buyer. If you scanned through this thread it is possible that you overlooked this mention of it as the conversation here was progressing into more of an argument between people. I had asked jh_coop_buyer at the time if it would be possible to post an example of your report here so that people can determine for themselves if there is value in it. Since this is your report, could you do this? I&#039;ve been trying to cut down on the amount of emails I get and I have been avoiding signing up for any additional ones. <br /><br />Based on the REBNY reports, I would agree with your assessment. The archive of past REBNY reports can be found here for anyone interested: http://www.ny1residential.com/Content/Content.aspx?ContentID=1405995 (http://www.ny1residential.com/Content/Content.aspx?ContentID=1405995)<br /><br />Also, it would be great to have your opinion on another thread here pertaining to real estate as I feel it would be beneficial to hear from one of the smaller brokers that are focused primarily on Jackson Heights. Topics include: co-brokering, the pros and cons of listing on MLS and RLS, and whether one should work with a local broker or a larger citywide company when selling or buying a home. Your colleague, Michelle Beaudoin was mentioned (good things only) so it may be of particular interest to you.<br /><br />Here is a link to that conversation: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0)

				Thank you for your kind words Matt.&nbsp; Honestly, I try to stay out of the fray.... the regular back-and-forth on blogs.<br /><br />Should anyone have any questions on Jackson Heights real estate, the can call or email me.&nbsp; That is my job.&nbsp; My contact information is on www.jhrealestatereport.com<br /><br />Final comment: co-brokering benefits the seller, since it opens the property to other firms and agents, and will hopefully allow the seller to obtain a better sales price, faster.&nbsp; Listing agents have a fiduciary responsibility to work in the best interest of their client, the seller.&nbsp; Unless the seller specifically requires that the listing remain exclusive to the firm, the real estate professional would be doing a disservice to the client by not co-broking the listing with other licensed agents.
