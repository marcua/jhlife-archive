				So when can we relax the mask rules for kids here in NYC?&nbsp; 2/3 of the health organizations (UNICEF &amp; WHO) recommend no masks ever for kids 5 and younger, kids 6-11 shouldn&#039;t wear them either except if there are around someone at high risk.&nbsp; So now that most adults are vaccinated, or have had the chance.&nbsp; What are we waiting for?&nbsp; When can the community start to relax the rules a bit?&nbsp; <br /><br />For whats its worth, i not even talking about inside, I just mean walking the streets and the playgrounds.&nbsp; let see some faces again.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you leave the NYC metro area, its like a whole new smiling world...<br /><br />

				The answer, unfortunately, is that it&#039;s way too soon.&nbsp; There is emerging evidence that some of the new variants, like B.1.1.7, are a lot more transmissible among kids in school and other congregate settings and some variants may be associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. (https://khn.org/morning-breakout/kids-play-huge-role-in-spreading-b-1-1-7-variant-osterholm-says/)<br /><br />What we are waiting for is more data on variants and for a larger proportion of our population to be vaccinated.&nbsp; We have made it so far and I know we are tired, but this is not the time to start relaxing on the proven core-4 measures (masking, social distancing, hand washing, stay home when feeling sick).<br /><br />There&#039;s no rush.

				Over time, mask guidance has evolved, but one concern has always been that frequently touching masks negates the benefits and can even increase exposure to germs (dirty hands touch dirty faces and then other people or surfaces and so on). The younger the child, the more likely they are to fiddle with their masks (and they’re unlikely to be infected or contagious anyway). <br /><br />But realistically, given what the community has been through, their typical political leanings, and the trust placed in Dr. Fauci, I don’t expect any change until Fauci makes a call. And that will be based on some mixture of science, public health intuition, and politicking. I would guess it doesn’t change until 2022 but would love for things to move faster in alignment with mass vaccination.

				sorry, my last response was sloppy and ranty...<br /><br />My main point, is when can we start acting like the rest of the northeast?&nbsp; In school, of course wear a mask; going into grocery store, of course; but take it off when your outside.&nbsp; We have to begin weighing the physical harm (inhaling plastics, flame retardants, vo2max) and physiological harm of prolonged mask wearing.&nbsp; I can not overstate how refreshing/calming it is to see people&#039;s faces every time I leave NYC.&nbsp; <br /><br />From the beginning and continues today the driver of infection is indoor congregate settings, not being outside on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Its been recently reported only 1 out over 1000 case is from outside exposure.&nbsp; &nbsp;So when will &quot;the science&quot; catch up to our brains?&nbsp; <br /><br />Look, i understand everyone is not fully vaccinated yet, but the reality is some adults will choose not to do it. I do not think it is fair to make the children wait indefinitely.&nbsp; At some point (mid may?!?!?!) I hope a critical mass of parents will start to agree with me and we can collectively take the masks off these poor kids...

				Once everyone who wants to get vaccinated has done so, then it’ll make sense to reduce precautions. That way, everyone has gotten the chance to make their choice about how careful they want to be, while recognizing that once you’re as protected as possible, you have to return to a more normal life (unless you intend to continue living with those precautions forever). <br /><br />Let’s hope mid-May is the ticket!

				Might I humbly suggest that many kids still want to wear masks, their parents support them wearing masks, and we could do without the “poor kids” framing on something that doesn’t harm you and in fact is probably helping to keep you safe.<br />We’ve gotten used to it but Covid is still spreading at very high levels in NYC and these new variants are no joke. <br />

				Masks are in no way harmful to children except possibly the strings getting caught on playground equipment and causing an injury. If you would like to learn more, you can check what Healthy Children says at https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Mask-Mythbusters.aspx (https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Mask-Mythbusters.aspx)

				to paraphrase those who oppose rules about wearing masks and such, if you don&#039;t like masks and social distancing, simply stay home. don&#039;t go outside. don&#039;t let fear of the rest of us keep you from taking part in society.

				The question I have is why anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are always trying to get others to go along with them? Do what you think is right for your children if you must, but leave my children and other people&#039;s children alone. In answer to your question, it will be safe for everyone to go without masks once we have herd immunity. That will occur when enough people are vaccinated or survive Covid that it can&#039;t spread through the community. To live in a neighborhood where thousands have died from this virus and have someone suggest that seeing the smiling faces of children is somehow more important than saving lives dismays me. How many children have died from wearing masks as opposed to how many children have died or been orphaned by people not wearing masks? Show me the math.

The new variants spreading in NYC are far more contagious than the old one, and even if they don&#039;t kill you they can mess up your life, or that of your child, for a long time to come.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stanford is officially disavowing this article and it turns out the author hasn’t even been affiliated with the Palo Alto VA since 2016!

When your children are fully vaccinated, you can tell them to take their masks off when outside. That might be some time in the fall. I believe they are going to request emergency authorization for children in the 12 to 16 age group sooner.

				Seemed like 90 percent of the people walking on 34th Ave. today were wearing masks. Please be tolerant of them for not being so quick to &quot;trust the science&quot;-- a once-size-fits-all CDC recommendation covering everything from Wyoming to the sidewalks of NYC -- a lot of them are basing their behavior on the lived experience of seeing loved-ones and neighbors die from the pandemic.

Honestly I don&#039;t know why I keep bothering to respond here because I feel like 80JHer is just trolling at this point, but you are so right, why do they care so much whether other people continue to feel it is a sign of respect for others? Or it if gives them a sense of security after the awfulness of this past year?<br /><br />This &quot;masks cause brain damage&quot; argument is really mind-boggling to me. 80JHer, do you truly believe all the doctors, nurses, and other health care workers who have been working in N95s throughout the pandemic are now brain damaged from all this mask wearing? Who do you intend to get your medical care from in the future? I guess you can ask a never-masked rando off the street take your appendix out since their brain is more intact than these hypoxic, hypercarbic, CO2-poisoned doctors, but that seems unwise.<br /><br />The one thing we do agree on is that the vaccination rates and infection rates are great news. Keep it up JH!!

Due to resistance to the Test and Trace Corps efforts, there is limited information about the source of infections in New York City. I have seen estimates that 10% of infections were from outside, but there is no hard evidence either way. It is clear that vaccinated people can still get infected, so unvaccinated people should continue to be careful. Wearing a mask is a social courtesy to others, so those who are socially responsible may still want to be considerate of their neighbors. Also instead of telling others to take off their masks and trust the science, you may want to urge them to get vaccinated.

Telling people to move on from a traumatic experience in a way that makes <em>you</em> feel comfortable is problematic. You don&#039;t tell someone they&#039;ve &quot;grieved long enough&quot; or had &quot;enough time to move on&quot; after a loss, and if you do, well you ARE an asshole (your word) even if you don&#039;t mean to be.<br /><br />I am vaccinated, my young kids have had covid, and we still wear masks when we are outside and around others. We feel it is a sign of respect for our community which has been through a lot, we don&#039;t want our older or unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable neighbors to have to wonder why we don&#039;t have them on. There is some serious projecting going on to say it&#039;s because we are &quot;crippled by fear.&quot; My kids are happy, well-adjusted, and understand that this is a temporary thing we are doing to be able to see friends and do activities they love.<br /><br />Look, I am a doctor have professional training in public health as well. There are individual behaviors that primarily harm the individual, like smoking or eating junk food. There are individual behaviors that have a real risk of harming others and thus should be regulated, things like driving drunk, having unsecured guns in your home, or not wearing a mask during a pandemic. And then there are individual behaviors that you might find weird or stupid but they don&#039;t hurt anybody, so you just let people live their lives and do what makes them happy, things like washing pre-washed lettuce. You&#039;ve tried hard to argue that wearing a mask falls into the 1st or 2nd category, but it doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s the last one. I&#039;m quite sure it will be easier just to explain this to your kids than it will be to convince our neighborhood to get over their pandemic trauma on your schedule.

				In other countries around the world (yes -not the USA) if someone has already had covid they are not required to get the vaccine.&nbsp; So if you look at the % of population that has already had Covid plus the % that are fully vaccinated - it stands to reason that nobody has to wear a mask.&nbsp; I am left of Bernie Sanders &amp; AOC, but it is time to move on.&nbsp; <br />I received my vaccine and because I trust science I believe I will be safe going forward.&nbsp; <br />It seems like 90% of people in JH are wearing masks outside on the street for no real reason. <br />My hope is that schools open up 100% the day after Labor Day.&nbsp; 100% in person teaching.&nbsp; <br />Once that happens most things can go back to pre-pandemic normal..<br /><br />
