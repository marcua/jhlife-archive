					The dairy sign, a finely made relic of the past, was visible until about 20 years ago until it was covered over.<br />With any luck the landlord is paying to have many new signs installed in the sign-band portion of the building, where the dairy sign was situated, and maybe signs that aren&#039;t bad looking either.

					Happy you are enjoying the Post Office garden and thank you for noticing. <br />There were many plants we would have loved to use, but in working with a volunteer NYC parks landscape architect and neighbor, we focused on several strategies:<br />* plants that will provide close to four seasons interest, as well as a variety of colors and shapes.<br />* Shrubs and long-lived perennials so we don&#039;t need to replant every year, including natives and drought-tolerant species to the extent possible. <br />* Plants that will attract beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, especially butterfly weed and milkweed, the only plant that monarch butterflies lay their eggs on.<br />As for fragrance, we have Russian sage in there which has an amazing scent.<br />We will be doing some fine-tuning; for instance, the nursery will replace 20 Black-eyed Susan plants because they are not the variety we ordered. They have tiny flowers and are way to big for the front of the garden, blocking the view of other plants.<br />

I&#039;m pretty sure you know that and are jut being provocative.<br />Also, the city provides mental health services, but the big problem is some of these folks are pretty resistant to help. The city can pick people up against their will only if they pose a hazard to themselves or others, and it is only for a short period. This is a nationwide problem, not just NYC.

					Thank you, all.<br />Our goal is environmental sustainability, not just making JH look good, although there&#039;s nothing wrong with that.<br />Our curbside gardens create a hospitable environment for the trees they surround to grow and thrive. In turn, trees -- especially big mature trees -- significantly reduce street temperatures, and even that in our homes, through shade and transpiration (basically cooling by evaporation.) And that reduces the need for AC, meaning less energy consumption and less planet-warming carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere.<br />What&#039;s more these tree gardens, and the larger Post Office garden, are habitats for beneficial insects, hence our slogan, Bringing Mother Nature back to the city.<br />Many of you have participated in our efforts. Thank you. For those who haven&#039;t, we hope you will join us once, you just might enjoy it. If not you don&#039;t have to do it again, promise.

					Selling a Thule X-Cargo Xtreme roof carrrier that is was one my smartest purchases. I needed big-van storage space for long family trips, but also needed a smaller car that got good mileage for my daily work commute to the suburbs. <br />The cargo carrier has a long and low profile that does very harm to gas mileage. See link for what it looks like and details. It also has customer reviews. <br /><span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong><a href="https://www.sears.com/x-cargo-xtreme-car-top-carrier/p-02872016000P" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.sears.com/x-cargo-xtreme-car-top-carrier/p-02872016000P</a></strong></span><br />The carrier works great and looks good with only a few superficial scratches. The only reason I&#039;m selling is because we no longer need to pack as many people in our car for long trips.<br />Dimensions: 76&quot; (L) x 33&quot; (W) x 16&quot; (H) You will need a roof rack, which comes with many cars. I purchased a Mazda roof rack, but I&#039;m not sure if it works on non-Mazdas.<br />Please contact me at <a href="mailto:LenManiace@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">LenManiace@gmail.com</a>. I&#039;m local (on 80th Street) so you can have it in time for a weekend trip. Price $75, but will negotiate.&nbsp; I paid a little under $200, if I correctly recall.

					Jackson Heights resident, attorney, and member of the NYC Planning Commission Larisa Ortiz voted no on the zone change. She made the following comments on the proposal, which would allow the developer to build 13 stories rather than the maximum of nine now permitted. Her main concerns were ambulance access to the hospital and the city&#039;s archaic 1961 zoning revision&nbsp; calls for far more parking than would be needed in an area only one block from the subway. This excess of parking runs counter to the city&#039;s goals to cut the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.<br /><br />&nbsp;<em><br />First I would like to say that I support density - and certainly affordable housing - at transit rich locations.&nbsp; Our city&#039;s robust economic growth depends on supporting a growing population and in ensuring that people of all incomes have healthy, safe places to live. <br /><br />I have two issues with this proposal. The first is not unique to this site. The original 1961 zoning undercuts the city’s sustainability goals with high parking requirements – and then allows even more parking beyond the requirement – all at transit rich locations.&nbsp; As a result, under this rezoning, we will have 120 units and 128 parking spaces (above the required 48) only ½ block from a subway station.&nbsp; I know this zoning text predates all of us here, but it behooves us to revisit it in light our collective OneNYC goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. <br /><br />My bigger concern is the impact this project will have on emergency vehicles to Elmhurst Hospital, a Trauma 1 Medical Center and one of the busiest in the nation, whose emergency entrance is located along Baxter 1 block south of the site. I understand that an as of right scenario would also result in a loading dock at the intersection of Baxter/83nd, however, under the rezoning, we are doubling the size of this development. The commercial alone will go from about 20k sf to over 76k sf, a nearly fourfold increase which will result in more frequent loading/unloading and more 18-wheelers that will need pull forward, block 83nd Street - and emergency vehicles - and then pull back into the dock.&nbsp; And the cars entering and exiting the lot at this same intersection, serviced only by two elevators I might add, will further exacerbate congestion.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that the traffic analysis did not take into account the buses that ring this awkward triangular site. When asked about these routes, the development team wasn’t aware of the routes or their frequency. Nor did the analysis take into account the fact that the street pattern, where two street grids clash, mean that 83nd Street provides the ONLY direct north/south connection for nearly 1/2 mile between 77th and 85th Streets. The traffic study states only that sufficient alternative access is available to the east, south and west. Well, there are over 8,000 people who live in the ten block area directly north of the hospital. For them, those reassurances are no consolation.<br /><br />While the hospital inexplicably chose not to weigh in on this matter, the Uniformed EMT Union did. I wish they had spoken at the hearing. They said this at a recent press event and I QUOTE “There are times this turns into a bottleneck and people can’t get through. We’ve sometimes waited 5-6 minutes to get into the ER. We’ve pulled patients out of the ambulance and walked them in from off the street.&quot; END QUOTE<br /><br />If this project is to advance in its current form, I urge City Council to incorporate restrictions on loading/unloading, reduce the size of the parking facility in line with the city sustainability goals, and require a set aside for car-share vehicles that some studies have indicated replace as many as 15 personal vehicles for every one car-share vehicle.&nbsp; <br /><br />With that I vote no.<br /><br /></em><br />

					The NYC City Planning Commissioner approved a spot zone change yesterday, allowing four extra floors on the &quot;Target&quot; building (the old Jackson Theater) on 82nd Street. Clearly a blatant give-away to the real estate industry (the folks who run NYC.) This building will create a traffic nightmare, jamming up a key ambulance access road to Elmhurst Hospital. And make no mistake, this will be followed up by similar redevelopment of other smaller buildings in the area.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Now the zone change request goes the the City Council where if tradition holds, the Council member in whose district the zone change resides gets the final word. (Francisco Moya.)<br /><br />In this case, however, Elmhurst Hospital sits in Councilman Dromm&#039;s district and some believe he has reasonable cause to speak out in opposition to the zone change. We are talking about the major medical institution for a good chunk of Queens; what&#039;s more a major part of the city&#039;s hospital system. <br /><br />Don&#039;t have time to comment much more now since I&#039;m at work.<br />

					Whether you count that as JH or not, the point the area is in danger of a building boom no seen since the &#039;50s and 60s. And as I&#039;ve noted, we (11372) are one of the densest zip coede in NYC and the densest outside of of Manhattan. <br />BTW, the CPC approved four extra floors on the &quot;Target&quot; building yesterda. Now it goes the the City Council where tradition holds that the Council member in whose district the zone change resides gets the final word. In this case, however, Elmhurst Hospoital sites in Councilman Dromm&#039;s district and some believe he has reasonable cause to chime in.&nbsp;
