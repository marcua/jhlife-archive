					Yes, we had a subsequent occasion to go to an ER, and I asked the doctor we had called if in this case it would be okay to go into Manhattan instead of to Elmhurst. We ideally wanted to go to the hospital most of our doctors are affiliated with, Weill Cornell. In that case it was okay to go further (different health issue). No ER is in any degree pleasant, but the issues that bothered us at Elmhurst did not exist at Weill Cornell.

					Several years ago my husband was taken by ambulance to Elmhurst Hospital, to be checked for possible heart attack. I am not usually a germaphobe type, but I was horrified by the dirtiness of the ER there, to the extent that I wouldn&#039;t sit in one of their seats. The intake process was also alarming--at first we could not get anyone&#039;s attention. I got on the phone with one of my husband&#039;s outpatient doctors and told him I was unhappy with Elmhurst and could we leave and go someplace else? He said no, if it&#039;s suspicion of heart attack you have to stay put. I was also a bit freaked out by the visible fact that this is a hospital used for prisoners. It was kind of upsetting to see patients chained to beds. At one point, I helped my husband go to the bathroom, and when we came out we found a shackled prisoner escorted by a policeman waiting to get in. At a time when I was already upset and scared--honestly, to see this sort of thing I found added to my distress. However--and this is a big however--once my husband was in a room and being cared for by doctors, he was happy and pleasantly impressed with his care. Later, we were told by several people that Elmhurst is a designated trauma center, and since it&#039;s only a few blocks from our apartment, in an emergency we definitely should go there. (This was before our present healthcare situation, of course, which has made going to any healthcare setting a bit fraught.) And happily, my husband had not had a heart attack, but they wanted to be sure and kept him overnight. All in all, it&#039;s not a pretty place, but the word is that it&#039;s a good hospital staffed by very good doctors.

					Also tried it Friday for dinner. Very tasty! There were lots of customers, so it took a pretty long time to get the order--but I&#039;m happy they are off to a good start. They were out of baba ganoush (sp?) by the time we got there (late afternoon) so they definitely have to work the kinks out, but that&#039;s to be expected. It&#039;s also at a good price point. I hope it&#039;s a hit!

					Yes--I hope this is a big hit --I&#039;ve always wished Sami would be open late enough for us to get takeout for dinner from him. His cooked food was always excellent, but we never wanted a big meal for lunch. Love this menu and with delivery offered, it&#039;s perfect.

					Yes there was a thread on this, or it was included in another thread? It seems that JuJu&#039;s owner is retooling the place into a Lebanese restaurant or takeout operation--that was the rumor I heard. I have seen him outside the shop while work was being done, so it does seem it is him who is renovating, not a new owner. I hope it happens--though I will miss JuJu&#039;s having a Lebanese place there would be great.

					How exactly does the fact that the supermarket is busy with a certain clientele relate to the eyesore it has become, which posters are describing here? Is the suggestion that for a certain clientele the appearance of the store is fine, and we who are not that clientele (ie, according to the post, residents of the historic district) have no right to complain? How do you know that the store is only patronized by non-residents of the historic district? How do you know that the patrons of the store are not also bothered by its appearance? <br /><br />Interestingly, Farine&#039;s attracted a very wide swath of neighborhood people, with customers of all ethnic backgrounds, dressed in all sorts of garb, lining up and filling its tables. The owner created special halal and holiday menus, I believe. Which was so great, and seemed so unusual for a place like that. I think it&#039;s a false contrast to portray it as a gentrification issue, where Farine&#039;s was the gentrifier, and now the supermarket is giving the spot back to its rightful owner, the immigrant community. I think a lot of immigrants were in fact patronizing Farine&#039;s, and I&#039;m sure there are non-immigrants who shop at the supermarket.

					Agree with Chingwa. We&#039;re not lamenting that there is a newly expanded grocery store. We are lamenting that it replaced something unique and very valuable to the neighborhood, whereas there already are multiple grocery stores that all offer the same products. It&#039;s the same complaint that is made about the many chain pharmacies that are everywhere, offering the same products. I haven&#039;t seen the new lighting yet but it sounds dreadful.

					We liked Delhi Heights--loathed Jackson Diner. Too bad about Indian Taj--we did go there sometimes. Have yet to try Angel. I fear more and more restaurants might be throwing in the towel. Delivery and good weather outdoor dining is not enough to keep them going, alas.

					Thanks KDGHP. Exactly. Saying that people wanting to know the status of a local business they value and have been supporting with their dollars and patronage is &quot;entitled&quot; is like saying someone wanting to know why their romantic partner suddenly disappeared without a word of explanation is &quot;entitled.&quot; Of course you want to know what is going on--you&#039;ve had a sort of relationship with them and you want to know: will they come back? Why did they close? It&#039;s perfectly natural and not &quot;entitled&quot; and also perfectly natural to be pissed off when you find out that they lied to you about it.&nbsp; At a time like this when businesses are closing left and right for obvious reasons, why NOT be transparent and communicate that you are trying to work things out so you can re-open (if that&#039;s the case at a point in time) or you have to close, and thanks so much to our loyal customers, and we hope to be back someday. That&#039;s just good PR and good business. It was disappointing that they handled it the way they did.
