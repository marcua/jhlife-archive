			Dear Members,<br /><br />Please see the new guideline for Classifieds.&nbsp; Click on &quot;rules&quot; under the masthead, or just read the following.&nbsp; <br /><br />Classified boards (Apartments, Sublets &amp; Roommates; Community Trade and Classifieds; and Business Listings and Services Directory): These sections are for posting classified and local business listings and are not discussion forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Simple questions can be asked in the Classified boards, but please limit commentary and discussion to the appropriate board under &quot;Get Connected.&quot;<br /><br />Thank you for your cooperation and participation!
