			<strong>newbie</strong>:
			<br />
			I am thinking of buying at Washington and so I&#039;m reaching out to the hive mind for information about the building and neighborhood.&nbsp; Is the building the type of place where neighbors know each other, or the kind of place where people keep to themselves?&nbsp; Is the shared basement safe?&nbsp; What is the noise situation--some buildings just allow sound to carry more than others. Did the building finally get FIOS? How long does a typical commute to midtown take (I have all the apps, but sometimes the real experience is different). Do you usually get a seat?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen that 34th Ave is currently an open street due to the pandemic, and I&#039;ve read of efforts to make that permanent.&nbsp; Does 34th Ave usually have heavy vehicular traffic?&nbsp; I&#039;m concerned all the cars would be re-routed to 35th Ave if 34th becomes an permanent open street.<br /><br />Jackson Heights seems like a nice neighborhood, and I’m looking forward to exploring there, even if I don’t end up moving! I appreciate any other tips or information any of you can provide.&nbsp; Thank you!

Whether the neighbors are friendly or not depends on which floor you live on since there are few apartments per floor. <br /><br />There is Fios. The service is good but Verizon will try to cheat you. <br /><br />The basement is safe.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hear that the side streets 73rd and 74th are noisy. 35th avenue has more traffic because of the closing of 34th avenue but it is not bad. Queens has bad planning. They do one thing without thinking of the ramifications.<br /><br />The subway is quick to Manhattan. The apps would be accurate as to timing. You might get a seat on the subway. <br /><br />The renovations of the co-ops has been going on for YEARS. I am now listening to BANGING from some construction that has been going on for days (weeks?). It may stop some years into the future. <br /><br />The water is filthy, and there are bugs. <br /><br />The people get argumentative in the laundry room. Everyone is an expert, and they will tell you why. <br /><br />The residents usually wear masks. <br /><br />I will open a can of worms, but, the newer residents have a great deal of attitude. The building was calmer and more pleasant before it became co-ops.

			The neighborhood is phenomenal! The buildings vary -- some are very well run, and people are friendly; others aren&#039;t. I live in a small coop that&#039;s part of a larger complex, and there&#039;s a fantastic sense of community. <br />Good luck.

			Thank you everyone for your responses.&nbsp; jh35, it&#039;s hard to know what to make of &quot;it&#039;s a very nice building&quot; along with &quot;the water is filthy.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe due to the ongoing construction?&nbsp;
