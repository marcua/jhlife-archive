				Gamewise of course we have seven pages of games, mostly brain teaser type things (like UNBLOCK ME) that the resident genius in my house loves to solve.<br /><br />Still haven&#039;t figured out an app to let me download my .lit file soff the computer to my phone for train and bus reading though.<br /><br />

				I like the Urbanspoon App for finding places to eat depending on cuisine, price and location.&nbsp; You can use GPS to pinpoint where you are so for example I am in Long Island City and am in the mood for sushi but don&#039;t know where a sushi place is I can find one in 30 seconds and click on reviews to see if it is well regarded. <br /><br />Showtimes Apps for movies.&nbsp; Also, uses GPS and tells me what is playing and the times at cinemas closest to me.<br /><br />New York Times App a must for reading on the bus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Google Reader is great for their New York thread which includes Curbed, Gawker, Gothemist etc...<br /><br />Translator useful when looking at menus and you don&#039;t know what certain ingredients are.<br /><br />Wikipedia app - perfect for when you need to bet your friend $$$ and look something up quickly<br /><br />Trivia Pursuit - great for long train rides by self.&nbsp; Does not require internet.<br /><br />Voicenotes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use it much but good to have in the event that you need to record something.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				My new favorite app is Stanza, which, when open and the shareware from lexcycle is open and shraing on my desktop, can send any old .lit or other e-book file to the phone to be read like a Kindle.&nbsp; As well as buy new ones as the other apps do.<br /><br />Finally catching up on reading without lugging around books.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				On a seperate note, I saw on the latest iPhone commercial an app that has phonics cards you scroll through, like for the pre-K set.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to get that one for the kids at school for on the bus waiting ... anyone know the name?<br /><br />I&#039;m also still looking for a guru/partner to help me make other special ed apps ..

				If you go to the apps store, there are about 50 &quot;phonics&quot; apps. You could go there and see if the picture looks like the one on the commercial. The one that came up the most in my google searches was ABC Pocket Phonics. They have a free version, so you could try it out and if you think it&#039;s worth it buy the .99 version

				I did find out the one on the commercial was ABC Animals, I liked it because it was similar to the Fundations cards most schools, like mine, employ.<br /><br />I also downloaded ABC Tracer, for the kids who want to write letters.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s wild to think that a generation of 3 year olds has things on phones that 6 year olds learned the &quot;old school&quot; method ... technology booms make &#039;generation designations&#039; shorter ... look how long we were Gen X before Gen Y, etc.<br /><br />Still, I want to design one where I can set up a series of uploaded pictures that when you tap them, names are said.

				Nice.&nbsp; Thsi might the alternative I was looking for on my phone.<br /><br />I like scrabble, but didn&#039;t install the actual app on my iPhone because it ties to Facebook.&nbsp; See on Facebook I play and a lot of people there won&#039;t play iPhone folks because the version that ties it gives hints and other advantages.&nbsp; They even get labelled with a little iPhone icon online, so it&#039;s not worth the hassle.&nbsp; I almnost wish it didn&#039;t link, then I&#039;d buy the proper Scrabble app, I even had it on my old Sony phone.
