					Radical Tenderness YOGA Workshop Series:<br />Three Sundays this Summer 2015<br />6/28, 7/26, and 8/23<br /><br />Details for Radical Tenderness YOGA Workshop Series:<br /><br />For everyone. <br /><br />In this dynamic series of three workshops participants learn how to:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soothe the nervous system through retinal sensation of the thermal delight of color and through patterned breath-sound.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Practice mandalic yoga poses that open the heart through the breath, the gaze and flowers<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heal mental clutter by sweeping the breath across specific nerve endings of the roof of the mouth, dentals, and lips.<br />&nbsp; <br />Sunday 6/28 2:30-4:30pm<br />Workshop 1. Radical Tenderness: Breath<br />Learn to let go of the five main factors of negativity through the five yogic breath &amp; tongue positions. Give your lungs full permission to generate joy from their innate function of oxygenating the muscles to redress selfishness, anger, depression, fear, and self-doubt.<br />&nbsp; <br />Sunday 7/26 2:30-4:30pm<br />Workshop 2. Radical Tenderness: Hands<br />Learn to harmonize the five yogic breath positions with ancient hand postures to make a beautiful, positive feedback loop of alpha brain-waves to redress selfishness, anger, depression, fear, and self-doubt.<br />&nbsp; <br />Sunday 8/23 2:30-4:30pm<br />Workshop 3. Radical Tenderness: Rest<br />Experience the grace of the involuntary heartbeat in the precise supine position called corpse pose in yoga. Workshop uses the guided meditation text prescribed by Nobel Peace Prize Nominee Thich Nhat Hanh (nominated by Dr. Martin Luther King, 1967). <br /><br />Each workshop is $25.

The 90-minute special Saturday sessions are gentle, sequential Himalayan Hatha Yoga cleanses that provide an unabridged, three-fold preparation for meditation: yoga asana (body posture flow), pranayama (breath flow), and deep stillness (mind flow). Each turn of season is prime time to rest, recharge, and meditate through yoga!<br /><br />Questions? Call the teacher, Suran Song at (646) 240-2823 or email <a href="mailto:suran@suransong.com" class="bbc_email">suran@suransong.com</a>

Suran really enjoys teaching.<br /><br />Suran Song is a visual artist who, in 1999 when she took her first yoga class in Princeton, could not bend to touch her knees without tightness. Upon moving to New York City in 2002 she found Himalayan Yoga. Because Himalayan Yoga is transmitted with a strong visual art component, she found it instantly recognizable, which had not been the case in her previous encounters of yoga taught by dancers and gymnasts. In 2004, she undertook an intensive three-year Himalayan teacher-training course, one-to-one with her Guru, where she studied the classical sun-salute forms A, B, C, and D and poses in Sanskrit through the lens of body, speech, and mind: anatomy of movement, art of energy management, and loving-kindness meditation with the emphasis of yoga not only as limbering aerobic exercise, but also as holistic therapy for healing.<br /><br />Her video bio is available courtesy of Ogilvy <a href="http://suransong.com/videobio.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://suransong.com/videobio.html</a>

					YOGA FOR ALL Affordable Private Yoga Sessions, $10 per 45-minute session, with Suran Song, and subsidized by an honorarium from Create Change. For women in Jackson Heights. All ages and experience levels welcome! Ideal for absolute beginners and students who want yoga sequences tailored to their individual needs. Call (718) 505-0978 to schedule.<br /><br />Since 2008, Suran Song has served yoga in diverse settings to a wide range of students: from Olympic swimmers at Asphalt Green and senior citizens at Lenox Hill House in Manhattan, to spas such as Swept Away, Negril, Jamaica, and Canyon Ranch, to private and public schools on the Upper East Side and East Brooklyn. Her certification program was an intensive three-year program (2005-2008), one-on-one with Pema Chakan in which she learned the classical namskaras and poses in Sanskrit, as well as traditional yoga philosophy and therapeutic procedures. She is influenced by yoga teachers Pema Chakan, Isaac Pena, Jude English, and Dechen Thurman. She is certified to teach Himalayan Yoga in the lineage of Krishnamacharya through Yoga Alliance, as well as to teach Elementary School, Grades 1-6, and Art Specialty, K-12 through a consortium of Parsons School of Design, Teacherâ€™s College, and Bank Street. This summer, Suran has concurrent yoga arts exhibits at Duke University, Center for Advanced Hindsight, and New York Cityâ€™s The Laundromat Project, Create Change. Her work has been given numerous accolades including the invitation to launch Ogilvyâ€™s YouTube Arts Channel: Create or Else (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Ogilvy" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/Ogilvy</a>) Her art is held in both private collections and public institutions including Feminist Art, Special Collections and University Archives Gallery, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. Her Korean father was a Professor of Eastern Philosophy and Library Director at Bryn Mawr College, and avid lover of art and archaeology. He fostered Suranâ€™s creative investigation into the unnatural order of things. Her Greek mother was also an educator and librarian. She gave Suran the love of democracy and reading.&nbsp; <br /><br />Suran is very excited to be able to offer yoga for all this summer in her neighborhood, and very thankful to The Laundromat Project, Create Change for the impetus and funds to do so.

					Dear Curious:<br /><br />Hello! Thank you for asking --I just put up pictures of some lovely students doing the yoga class during the very first session at <a href="http://suransong.com/createchange" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://suransong.com/createchange</a> Please scroll all the way down that page to view them. So far, there has been good space. Weâ€™ve had nice, regular attendance this month, so I will continue to offer it this summer as long as it is useful to the neighbors.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT</strong><br /><br />THIS SUMMER! FREE YOGA ARTS FOR ALL<br />Himalayan Yoga - Learn to combine a slow Vinyasa (flowing) style with attention to physical alignment and the breath. All levels. Himalayan Yoga has a rich visual arts approach; its teachers tend not to be dancers.<br /><br /><strong>WHEN</strong><br />Wednesday mornings beginning 6/6/12 from 8-9 a.m.<br /><br /><strong>WHERE</strong><br />JH Laundromat<br />85-15 37th Avenue<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br /><br /><strong>NOTES</strong><br />Please wear comfortable clothing.<br /><br /><strong>TEACHER BIO<br /></strong><br />Suran Song is a visual artist who, in 1999 when she took her first class yoga class, could not bend to touch her knees without tightness. She came to yoga skeptically and slowly: her Korean father was Professor of Eastern Philosophy at Bryn Mawr College where he taught a critical history of Asian religions outlining institutionalized misogyny and hypocrisy. As his approach was not popular in the atmosphere of the 1960&#039;s, he resigned his post to serve as Associate Director of the college library. Suran&#039;s Greek mother, also a librarian, merrily maintained Greek Orthodox traditions in the household.&nbsp; Always curious about the sublime and civics, Suran majored in visual art, and traveled extensively for 10 years making performance art rock music.&nbsp; In 2004, she found her yoga teacher, Pema Chakan, and Himalayan Yoga. Suran has taught yoga to people of all ages in many settings: at Trevor Day School, Asphalt Green, Middle Collegiate Church, Matrix Fitness, Oasis After-school, and Lenox Hill Neighborhood Center. The Himalayan Yoga Teacher training was an intensive three-year long course, which Suran completed in 2008. Suranâ€™s art and yoga practice is about bringing together opposites and the keeping sympathy: Suran makes art that uses yoga as medium. The inspiration of Sanskrit and the civics of politics influence her work as a painter and performance artist.&nbsp; She is very excited to be awarded the 2012 Create Change Artist in Residence &amp; Honorarium at The Laundromat Project here with JH Laundromat.<br />
