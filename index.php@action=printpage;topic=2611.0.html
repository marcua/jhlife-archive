				Should tenants be permitted to keep smaller pets despite a landlord&#039;s No-Pets rule on a lease?&nbsp; One elderly woman won a case allowing her to keep her two cats in her rent controlled apartment.&nbsp; This win begs the question of whether current laws and no-pet lease clauses contribute to pet overpopulation in the City.&nbsp; The article basically supports the idea that non-nuisance pets should be permitted to remain with their owners when discovered by landlords, and when a pet dies, a new pet be allowed.<br /><br /><strong>New York Daily News</strong><br />A court ruling could make it harder for landlords to evict tenants with cats (http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2009/04/18/2009-04-18_nopet_rule_declawed.html)<br />BY Amy Sacks<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER<br /><br />Saturday, April 18th 2009, 4:00 AM <br /><br />For the last five years, 73-year-old Siiri Marvits has been fighting her landlord in court for the right to remain in her rent-controlled West Village apartment with her feline companions, Athena and Apollo.<br /><br />But the state&#039;s second highest appellate court recently ruled that the landlord could not kick the elderly tenant out, despite a no-pets clause in her lease. Marvits had won the case in a lower appellate court last year but the landlord appealed.<br /><br />Animal law experts said this case would pave the way for other tenants whose pets are not a nuisance to neighbors.<br /><br />&quot;This decision should allay concerns of people with cats, small dogs and other animals who do not routinely or ever leave their apartments that they can still get protection under New York City&#039;s pet law,&quot; says Elinor Molbegott, legal counsel for The Humane Society of New York. &quot;It&#039;s a decision of the Appellate Division and lower courts should follow it.&quot;<br /><br />In 2004, Marvits was threatened with eviction from the two-room apartment where she has lived for 47 years. She has shared the Manhattan apartment for more than a decade with her timid cats - a mother and daughter she adopted.<br /><br />Marvits is protected under a 1983 Pet Law aimed at stopping landlords from using no-pet rules as an excuse to evict tenants so they can hike up the rent.<br /><br />The provision is waived if the landlord fails to take legal action within three months of the tenant&#039;s open and notorious harboring of the pet, according to the law.<br /><br />Marvits&#039; landlord, 184 W. 10th St. Corp., argued that she didn&#039;t &quot;openly and notoriously&quot; have the cats, because she didn&#039;t take them outside and they hid whenever someone entered the apartment.<br /><br />But the court agreed that their litter box and food bowls were plainly visible over the years to the building&#039;s superintendent and to various contractors who entered her apartment to fix leaky pipes and circuit breakers.<br /><br />Marvits was not required to display the cats in public, and the cats&#039; shy nature and tendency to hide from strangers also kept them out of sight.<br /><br />&quot;What I&#039;m hoping is we get to the stage where the only pet case we see is because of nuisance,&quot; said Marvits&#039; lawyer, Steven DeCastro.<br /><br />He is currently defending another client who has lived in her Manhattan rental condo unit for 34 years. Her landlord claims her cat smells and is a nuisance to neighbors, but she suspects they want to sell her valuable apartment.<br /><br />Experts are calling upon the City Council to pass legislation to expand the right of tenants to share their lives with companion animals. That includes the right of elderly tenants to get a new pet when one dies.<br /><br />No-pet clauses play a part in the tragedy of the city&#039;s pet overpopulation crisis, said Molbegotte, the animal shelter lawyer. She said the law limits the people who can keep pets in the city, and those threatened with eviction relinquish their pets to animal shelters.<br /><br />Some rules are about to become even more restrictive. Beginning May 1, the New York City Housing Authority will prohibit its tenants from having certain breeds of dogs, including Boston terriers, and will change the weight limit for adult dogs from 40 pounds to 25 pounds.

				I understand that some shareholders have had to move from their property upon the board finding out that there is a pet in the house.&nbsp; If the house rules indicate no pets are allowed, and you sign them the board expects you to abide by the house rules.&nbsp; My building allows dogs, but up to 30 lbs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some real estate agents have put ready, willing and able buyers through the board interview, knowing the house rules themselves, to then find out that their 50 lb. dog will not be allowed to live in the apartment.&nbsp; Not sure why those with pets want to move into a non-pet friendly building, but I always encourage those looking for property that are pet owners to move into pet friendly buildings to avoid any unpleasantries.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley6600:&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think what also happens sometimes is that people will live in a particular rental building for many years without being aware of specific rules outlined in leases.&nbsp; New building ownership will come in and enforce the no-pets rule.&nbsp; For example, I have friends that live in a rent stabilized apartment building for over 30 years.&nbsp; Their lease does contain a no-pets clause, yet the landlord was very lax about enforcing the rule.&nbsp; A new owner came in and immediately informed all tenants that only grandfathered pets would be allowed.

				If a pet is living in an apartment and it&#039;s not hidden, but no formal complaint is made about the pet, the no-pets clause in the lease is void. I&#039;m sure this law is not valid for a shareholder in a coop, but it is true for a renter.

				I agree, people should abide by the rules in place.&nbsp; However, I do think that boards need to be more open minded about their rules and reevaluate their rules and see if they do indeed make sense.&nbsp; For example, a lot of buildings have these archaic 30 lbs dog rules in place.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing that I learned through adopting my dog at the ASPCA is that a dog&#039;s behavior is based on energy level and not weight.&nbsp; For example, a Jack Russell (10 lbs) can create 4 times the amount of noise and destruction as a Greyhound (80 lbs). Wonderfully docile, large, well behaved dogs are needlessly euthanized in New York. In addition, a lot of dog&#039;s behavior is based on the owner&#039;s education and commitment (or lack there of) and not the dog breed.&nbsp; For example, some of my neighbor&#039;s have the nastiest Chihuahuas whereas I know many dog owners who have very laid back well behaved Pitbulls, Rottweilers and Mastiffs.&nbsp; Education, education, education is key. For both dog owners and non-dog owners.<br /><br />Also, pet ownership and the pet market is big business and increasing.&nbsp; I think buildings will find that being pet friendly these days is more of a bonus than a hindrance.&nbsp; You broaden your pool of prospective owners / renters.

A well trained dog is a good dog, no matter the size, and a poorly behaved dog will run rampant and cause trouble, even if it&#039;s only 10 pounds. If people don&#039;t properly train and exercise their animals, that&#039;s poor pet ownership, not a bad animal.

				I agree that there are irresponsible dog owners out there.&nbsp; Today I heard on the news that the New York Housing Authority will be issuing new regulations banning large breed dogs like Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, etc. in public housing.&nbsp; These are breeds they believe to be dangerous.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the dogs are not the problem, and it&#039;s a shame that these poor animals are trained by people to behave aggressively thereby creating bad raps for them.

				I think any dog can be trained to be aggressive.&nbsp; Somewhere on another thread I told a story of how I was once approached by a guy asking if I was interested in teaching my dog aggressive behavior.&nbsp; I have a small dog, so obviously, he didn&#039;t see that as a hindrance.&nbsp; My guess is that if the NYCHA tops the weight limit at 25 lbs., then these people would still aim for the larger sized dogs.

				No-pets rules make absolutely no sense to me.&nbsp; They are knee-jerk responses to hypothetical problems. If there is a problem with a pet owner - deal with THAT.&nbsp; Blanket rules on dogs under a particular weight is ridiculous.&nbsp; People often make more noise and damage common areas than dogs - two reasons boards often cite as to the rationale for the bans.&nbsp; My large dog is and always has been a good neighbor and good canine citizen.&nbsp;

But since one cannot foresee all annoyances that may occur in multi-unit housing, prohibiting pets, is a &quot;solution&quot; to what could be a non-existent problem.&nbsp; Plus by the time these rules are made effective, the offender often already lives there and it only serves to keep out newcomers.&nbsp; It seems like an easy vote for boards to appear pro-active.&nbsp; If a person would make an irresponsible pet owner, they will likely be an inconsiderate neighbor in other ways so why ruin it for people with well-behaved pooches? <br /><br />What about residents who play certain musical instruments, sing, cook aromatically strong food or smoke cigars?&nbsp; How many boards prohibit those activities?&nbsp; Recently, some retirement communities in Florida moved to prohibit children from living there which resulted in a huge uproar.&nbsp; Residents were concerned that children would make noise and be disruptive.&nbsp; Would your response be for the newcomers to find a building that permitted children?&nbsp; Finding a building that accepts pets seems to be more and more difficult for prospective buyers and renters. Dogs are part of our community and shouldn&#039;t be excluded arbitrarily.

				<strong>Every one has an opinion based on their particular position or experience.&nbsp; I&#039;m a pet owner and have served on boards in the past.&nbsp; As per weight limits there are legitimate reasons why a Board would limit weight or size for dogs.&nbsp; There are very many people that will not get on an elevator with a large dog, I&#039;m one of them.&nbsp; I have had several pets in my lifetime and I love dogs.&nbsp; I have been bitten twice by large dogs (once when I was 8 in PR as well...LOL) in my life and while I won&#039;t run away from a large dog in the street nor will I show fear I will think twice before getting into an elevator with a large or mean looking dog that I don&#039;t know. ..but that&#039;s my experience.&nbsp; There are 2 buildings I work in and I have seen children and adults become fearfull of a large dog in an elevator.&nbsp; I believe buildings should not have blanket rule either but it is their right to do so because many residents are not willing to manage special interest issues.&nbsp; If a building has a liberal pet rule than that&#039;s fine too.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In my experience few boards are willing to change a No Pet policy and when they do it is often one that would only allow cats.&nbsp; Creating a pet friendly environment in a Coop is difficult but not impossible if the Board or a committee is willing to work on it.&nbsp; If a building has a couple of irresponsible pet owners it will create an environment of animosity towards dog owners.&nbsp; If uncomfortable pet scenarios are not addressed in a responsible and official manner it may mushroom into a &quot;no pet policy&quot; for future residents.&nbsp; If you are a pet owner in a pet friendly building I would strongly recommend creating a committee that deals with pet issues.&nbsp; Make sure that the rules are clear and that they are being followed and I would strongly recommend that the committee is headed by a pet owner.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is always good to place ourselves in the other residents shoes before we go and demonize those that frown upon pet&#039;s in a coop.&nbsp; For those that do not like or own pets in a coop you should know that pets bring love and companionship to many of us.&nbsp; Taking that away from someone is cruel and inhumane but by the same token you shouldn&#039;t have to put up with constant barking and filth so pet owners should be responsible.&nbsp; Playing the devils advocate is what need to be done when it comes to pet policies.&nbsp; If a building is pet friendly it often makes it easier for a seller and in my experience can sell faster and maybe for more because a pet owner will be willing to pay more for a property since many coops wont allow them.&nbsp; On a last note, buildings with weight limits can explore a NO LARGE DOGS in elevator rule so they can welcome larger dogs into the building (just a thought) </strong>
