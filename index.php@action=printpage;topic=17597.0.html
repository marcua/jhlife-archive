				A very large one bedroom with a nice layout and from the floorpan it looks like nice closet space.&nbsp; If I was looking to move back to JH I would&nbsp; definitely find out more.&nbsp; Is $2,200&nbsp; the market rate for a one bedroom now I was thinking more around $1850&nbsp; but no fee is a big plus.

				The average market rate for a one bedroom in Jackson Heights (or any size) is $26.00 a square foot.&nbsp; The one bedroom at Stratford Hall is fairly priced at $2198 especially considering there&#039;s no broker fee and it&#039;s on the top floor.&nbsp; This will move quickly.
