			City Lore, a great non-profit promoting preservation of NYC&#039;s cultural heritage, has as interesting new web project called City of Memory.&nbsp; It&#039;s a map browser that lets you read stories about specific places throughout the city.&nbsp; Or, as the website says, &quot;a grand new repository for all of New York City&#039;s stories and experiences.&quot;&nbsp; It lets you add your own stories, too, but these don&#039;t show up on the site immediately.<br /><br />The site is currently highlighting a tour of Jackson Heights by Madhulika Khandelwal, Director of the Asian American Center at Queens College.
