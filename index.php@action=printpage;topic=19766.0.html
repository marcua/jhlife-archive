				Gloves aren&#039;t even that sanitary. Do you think they change gloves for every order? No, and do they ever wash their gloves? No. And can you feel if you get something wet on the gloves you are wearing? No. It&#039;s a topic that always occurs with sushi restaurants. I think at this time, masks for restaurant workers should be used, especially just to put the customers at ease.

				I&#039;m with Jeff on that. I passed by the Queensboro yesterday and was heartened to see that they had masks. A few days ago PioPio didn&#039;t, which was a problem. <br />Be a really good idea if all restaurant workers were wearing masks.

				<strong>Table Wine</strong> is open for pickup and delivery and has a good system in place - order by phone - <strong>718 478 9463</strong> - and either have delivered or pick up from their shop. If picking up, you don&#039;t enter the store, just get their attention, give your name and they leave your purchase on a bench outside. You must pay by credit card over the phone, so they do not come in direct contact with customers.<br /><br />I also noticed <strong>American Chicken</strong>, <strong>Emoji Burger</strong>, <strong>Just Made 4 You</strong>, and <strong>K&amp;L Deli</strong> open. More and more restaurants are closed. <br /><br />There were fewer vendors at the farmers market today as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely torn between staying home and going out in public to support our local businesses. I generally don&#039;t use delivery and feel stranger about doing so now. If you are vulnerable, then I think delivery or relying on neighbors makes sense. Don&#039;t hesitate to reach out to people you know for help if you need it!

				Ordered from Emoji Burger tonight for pickup. It was ready in about 12 minutes. I liked the burger, they make it medium well but the meat had a nice char and was still juicy. I wasn&#039;t crazy about the brioche bun, and fries were cold by the time I got home, but your mileage may vary. I was grateful that they were open. Their online menu was limited, but they handed our their usual order with the meal, so if you have a favorite burger, ask for it.

				Adding to the list, Gino&#039;s pizza at 39-63&nbsp; 61 street is quite good. My son had it delivered(the Sicilian) and I thought it was better than Louie&#039;s or Sam&#039;s.

				Saw on the JH facebook group that 969 Coffee was still open and stopped by today. The salmon sushi I got was fresh, tasty, and satisfied a Japanese food craving I&#039;ve had for weeks. The guy in front of me got some onigiri sandwiches that also looked amazing.

				969 Coffee is a neighborhood gem. It&#039;s always one of our top options for takeout.<br /><br />Pho Bac on Broadway is still open for takeout - not sure about delivery. Last time we ordered, they seemed to be out of broken rice and had only regular rice, though.<br /><br />Mama&#039;s Empanadas on Northern is also open for takeout and delivery. We ordered a ton and froze them for future snacks.<br /><br />La CaleÃ±ita Bakery/tacos on 83rd is also open for takeout, but they&#039;ve remodeled and have a limited menu. Any idea if they changed owners or what&#039;s going on there? They were the only place in the hood to have birria :(

				i&#039;m sure it&#039;s not open right now, but Birrialandia cart on Roosevelt has amazing birria. Coatzingo also has a pretty decent birria de res, but again, not sure if they&#039;re open.

				We were lucky enough to be away for the winter.&nbsp; Our original plan was to return to JH on or around April 1st.&nbsp; But - Since the news at that time was so sad, we decided to visit my sister in NC.&nbsp; After a few weeks there we decided that we are basically treading water, and we can do that at home in JH.&nbsp; <br />Since arriving, I have been happy and relieved to see basically everyone wearing masks. The shopping has been pretty good, and overall it feels like â€˜thereâ€™s no place like Homeâ€™.&nbsp; <br />While we were away we were missing a lot of the fantastic food here!&nbsp; Since arriving we have been cooking daily, with the exception of a Delivery From : Ayata (Thai), Tacos Morelos (Mexican) and Asian Taste 86 (Indonesian) <br />Everyone here is so lucky to have easy access to incredibly delicious food!&nbsp; <br /><br />If you ever leave JH, you will miss it!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Please give our small local restaurants business during this difficult time
