				On the early morning of 8/26/2013 at about 3 am, I heard gun shots or fireworks outside of 82nd St and 37th ave. It was quite a scare and sent me jumping out of bed with my heart racing. Did anyone here this noise?<br /><br />Does anyone have any information?

				I didn&#039;t hear sirens after. I am thinking they were very loud fireworks right outside the window. I heard skateboards shortly thereafter.

				I heard fireworks a couple of days ago, but early afternoon.&nbsp; It&#039;s odd to hear them so late, post July 4th, but I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what it was.

				Superintendent of the building said police fired shots at someone at 1:30 am. Super jumped out of bed and said he saw the street blocked off. I haven&#039;t found any news reports or police blotter reports to confirm or debt what happened.

				Earlier this year, my husband and I were awoken by what we knew was gunfire. My husband looked out the window and saw people runiing down the street. They turned towards Roosevelt and were gone. When the police arrived, they treated us like we made up the entire thing, although we went downstairs in our pajamas to talk to them in the cold. I understand that they probably couldn&#039;t track down those involved at that point, but let&#039;s just say, someone was lying wounded somewhere, wouldn&#039;t hey have wanted us to contact them? Apparently not so much.
