				For those who think closing 34th Avenue permanently to traffic is a fantastic idea I ask you to please consider what this will do to traffic on 35th Avenue. It will create a nightmare for people walking, driving and trying to park on this residential avenue. In addition,&nbsp; it will make it slower for the Q49 bus to travel, you know the bus line we were all trying to save months ago. I&#039;m all for keeping 34th closed as long as COVID keeps people out of school and work and the weather is nice but seriously,&nbsp; everyone is going to go back at some point, the weather will turn colder, the street will be emptier and 35th Avenue will be swamped. Please don&#039;t sign petition to keep it open. It&#039;s a nice fantasy, let&#039;s keep it that way.

				Closures like these should be part of an integrated transport planning process. <br /><br />It&#039;s legit if a proposal to close a street has mitigation factors worked in.&nbsp; <br /><br />The outcomes you suggest are not inevitable if closures are conducted in that way.&nbsp;

				If the closures on 37 and 34 become permanent then they would need to remove all parking from 35. The traffic on 35 is insane now, and idiots keep double parking making it even worse.

				I have to agree with Bel84. I also live on 35th Avenue. The overflow from Northern Blvd. that was on 34th Avenue is now on 35th which is also narrower than 34th. I&#039;m glad to see the renovation of Travers Park, we really needed that. I said nothing when Travers took over 78th Street permanently, it adds to the park. When that was done people was upset about loosing a south bound street. The result was changing the direction of 75th Street to south bound. Now there is more traffic, noise, etc. on 75th.&nbsp; Closing 34th permanently is a mistake. As a temporary closure it has benefits. <br /><br />Enhancing the community needs to mean the community as a whole.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have been saying since the start of the Historic District that the boundaries of it need to be expanded. For the moment we see what happens to the non district parts of Jackson Heights. Maybe people think it is unimportant, but we loose those buffer zones that make this neighborhood what it is and can be.

				&nbsp;Finally! I have been saying this from the onset of the 34th ave closure. <strong>It&#039;s not the right avenue to be closed permanently - weekends might work though- as it&#039;s a vital artery in the flow of mobility in Jackson Heights. </strong>Bikes, cars, school buses, trucks, etc are able to navigate through the length of JH fairly smoothly. Taking 34th Ave out forces overcrowding on Northern Blvd and worse, real congestion on 35th Ave which is already too busy and has the important bus route. If any street in JH could handle a semi-permanent closure, it&#039;s 37th since traffic there is a nightmare already and anything would be an improvement with the crazy turns and double parking. Deliveries there to businesses on 37th Ave would be from the side streets or at night. Feasibility study anyone?<br />&nbsp; For the real and practical betterment, keep 34th Ave open to traffic!

				Definitely a bummer to lose 34th ave completely. The community should at least have it open on weekends and perhaps in the evening (5-8) on Fridays.<br /><br />It’s a great asset to the community and allows children and adults to exercise and bike safely (for most part) down the median which is helpful for families that have no car.<br /><br />Travers Park is great, but honestly too small and overcrowded for this community and that’s become more obvious as you see all the people using the median everyday.<br /><br />Would love to see a study done on the increase in traffic on 35th ave to see how badly it gets affected. And how much is data versus perception.

				Ummm I am not aware there is a petition, I will sign up. But yeah, I think we should at least keep it close on the weekend for start.<br /><br />I think we just not tackle this smartly, 35th ave should be enforce to no double park during certain hours or no parking during certain hours to speed up the flow. Every time I see a UPS, Fedex or FreshDirect or any other truck double park the whole traffic is backed up.<br /><br />I am also one of those as described here, that I bough a car during this lock down. I own a car for over 10+ years, then last 4 years I went car free. Parking does seem a lot tougher, but I don&#039;t think 35th ave traffic are as bad as what it is before 34th closure, or other post about Northern Ave, as it is always bad even before lock down.<br /><br />I am also noticing a lot people moving out as well, at least in my building 4 of my neighbor already move out and selling or sold their apartment already.

				Hi, I use 34th Ave as a place to ride my bike, as well as walks - and I love that it is closed to traffic for now. <br />One point I want to make is that all the parades that usually take place almost every Sunday have been cancelled this year.&nbsp; <br />In the past, if we had to drive on one of the parade days, the traffic all around was severely impacted in a negative way.&nbsp; <br />If + when the pandemic crisis is behind us, we cannot have 37th Ave And 34th Ave closed.&nbsp; It will be complete and total gridlock.&nbsp;

We could also close 37th too and maybe all the side streets while we are at it. We can all walk from Northern or Roosevelt, and ask deliveries to do the same.

				If it’s for recreation, then that’s fine.&nbsp; Keep it open.

				I think the state of the economy means we should be trying to encourage residents to stay instead of moving out of the city or out of the state. I don&#039;t know whether permanently closing 34th Ave is a good idea or a bad idea overall, but there needs to be some analysis and community feedback, which didn&#039;t appear to happen for the initial closure.<br /><br />The cost of having more open space / green space has to be paid by someone and at the moment it is being paid by anyone who has a car. Instead now might be a good time to acquire some land from businesses which no longer make financial sense to operate in the &quot;new world&quot;, and turn that into a park.

				35th is regularly gridlocked now and it will only get worse as the economy continues to open up. I literally got out of a Lyft and walked along 35th last week because cars were not moving at all. That had never happened before.

Drivers can use 34th Ave as long as someone leaves the barricades open enough to pass through slowly. Parking is plentiful during the day. Pedestrians may throw things at you and call you vile names, but it&#039;s not as bad as I feared it would be.<br />But 35th Ave has become impassable at times, particularly between 74th St and Leverich St. With all the double parked cars near 73rd St, buses turning, Amazon, UPS and ConEd vans double parked everywhere, you might have to wait a few red lights to pass 4 or 5 blocks at a time. Get someone to clean up the double parking and I think leaving 34th Ave closed during the day might be sustainable.

				Summer camp needs are not the same as permanent shut down of the Avenue.<br />Depending on the needs of the Summer camp Travers has space including 78th already permanently shut.

				&nbsp;As someone who is outside and on 34th Ave a lot, there isn&#039;t enough need to keep the street closed permanently. There are a number of times a day now where the use level is low. Low enough that just using the sidewalk would be adequate for exercise. When the gyms reopen, the schools reopen, the parks that are currently under construction in Travers and on 61st in Woodside and St Marks Church gardens, there will be many more places to exercise. It&#039;s funny to me that the only people who seem to be left out the conversation are those it might impact the most. I have seen a number of seniors, medical staff, delivery people and other residents mightily inconvenienced by the closing.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s one thing if its in the highly contagious time of Covid19 transmission but now that things have subsided - not gone yet- it feels like the street need not be closed as much. Certainly weekends could be an asset to the JH community for getting outdoors on those days when most of us have more free time but the rest of the time, it will be a waste of a resource for those needing to use the streets and who may be using cars, not bikes, to do the jobs, activities and errands our families need.

				&quot;I have seen a number of seniors, medical staff, delivery people and other residents mightily inconvenienced by the closing.&quot;<br /><br />That sounds like a bunch of nonsense. The streets are still accessible to delivery people, medical staff, and the elderly, even with a vehicle. I suppose if you are a snowflake and consider being mightily inconvenienced having to drive 5 mph for one block or possible having to get out of a vehicle to move a metal barricade over two feet then maybe. Most of the time the barricades can be passed without even moving them.

				For real data, someone should evaluate the usage at different times. I loved having the open streets during the height of pandemic and in summer, but there are times when it doesn’t seem to be used and creates more inconvenience and increased traffic on other Avenues. (I live on 35th). I biked today Sunday at 4 pm and there were very few people on the Avenue between 84th and Junction.&nbsp; Can see a compromise and keep the Open Street on Sunday, maybe part of Saturday. As we go back to some normalcy, don’t see a need for this to be permanent...

				&quot;He said its success is largely due to the dedicated residents who care for what has become an ad-hoc linear park. The entire community comes together to make sure the space works and is a safe place for neighborhood kids to play, Restrepo said.&quot;<br /><br />As much as I advocate for more open space in our neighborhood and am one of the folks using the street everyday for walks, I think this article is somewhat misleading. The above quote from the article is a broad statement making it seem like there is some active work going into making 34th Street cleaner and safer. Besides JHBG and residents maintaining the median gardens, the street is just as filthy (perhaps more) and just as safe as the rest in the neighborhood.

There&#039;s something to be said for the difficulty and complexity of managing a large group of volunteers so I can understand tha, but at the same time we&#039;re now almost 4 months in to Open Streets being the norm. I would think some of the volunteers might need a break.

				Queens Pol Makes It Official: Demands 34th Avenue Open Street Be Made Permanent<br /><br />https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/09/14/queens-pol-makes-it-official-demands-34th-avenue-open-street-be-made-permanent/?fbclid=IwAR3gAl7K07BLzGABf1G1Ox9pOvLjVCvg-NJvFWr3rAphfI3f_ASW9oHEXrQ (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/09/14/queens-pol-makes-it-official-demands-34th-avenue-open-street-be-made-permanent/?fbclid=IwAR3gAl7K07BLzGABf1G1Ox9pOvLjVCvg-NJvFWr3rAphfI3f_ASW9oHEXrQ)<br /><br />A Queens council member has jumped on the popular effort to turn the city’s best open street into a “permanent public space for the community” — the first salvo in a debate that will likely grow to include other neighborhoods that don’t want to lose their well-used gathering places once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.<br /><br />In calling for permanence, Council Member Danny Dromm cited “overwhelming positive response” from residents of Jackson Heights and Corona, whose neighborhood is second-to-last in per capita open space. He also cited the “wonderful impact” the open street between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard has had.<br /><br />“Children from the surrounding cramped apartments safely propel their scooters down the street,” he wrote. “A small group takes a salsa dance lesson in the open. Two older women pull out lawn chairs and bask in the sun.”<br /><br />The benefits go far beyond those three constituencies. Whether by kismet or design, the de Blasio administration’s 34th Avenue open street has long been described as the best one in the city — and several factors make it so: It runs entirely through a residential neighborhood with very little open space; it is parallel to the much busier Northern Boulevard, which provides drivers with a better route than a residential street; it has the strong support of volunteers who put out barricades every morning and remove them at night; it is very widely used by pedestrians, which deters drivers from using the roadway for local trips.<br /><br />Dromm’s letter was partly responding to a massive effort to focus attention on this particular open street. Earlier this summer, Streetsblog covered the initial failure of the project, which succumbed to the weight of overpolicing by the NYPD, only to become a uniquely popular space after cops stood down.<br /><br />Next, Streetfilms got both Dromm and State Senator Jessica Ramos to commit to the permanent car-free proposal. And Transportation Alternatives started a petition drive shortly thereafter — one that has already garnered 1,236 signatures (it’s online if you want to sign it). People who have volunteered to gather petitions have noticed how eager residents are to sign.<br /><br />“Being out on the street asking my neighbors to sign the petition is the best volunteer gig I’ve ever had,” said Angela Stach, who lives in Jackson Heights and has been collecting signatures for several weeks. “There is literally no need to explain why the city needs to make this open street permanent — because it’s completely self-evident. It has brought joy to our neighborhood during a very traumatic time, especially for the kids. And people really want to hold on to that. It’s almost surreal how easy it is to have these conversations with neighbors who have never before considered that the way in which cars monopolize public space is not the ‘natural’ order of things.”<br /><br />Stach believes that unlike other public space battles in her neighborhood, this one will be easier to win because people can see the benefits, rather than have to imagine them, as in the case of a new bike lane or residential loading zone that hasn’t been created yet.<br /><br />“Having experienced how the open street has transformed our everyday lives has dramatically broadened the constituency for challenging the dominance of cars in our community,” she said.<br /><br />One of the main organizers of the volunteer effort, Jim Burke, added that the community involvement was the key.<br /><br />“Many of us came together to demand open streets and then to open and close them together each morning and each evening,” he said. “We were hungry for connections, for exercise, for space and fresh air. Thirty-fourth Avenue enables all of that. So many of our neighbors plant the medians, clean the avenue and make sure drivers respect our open streets.”<br /><br />That’s not to say Jackson Heights and Corona residents are all holding their hands in a Kumbaya moment for a car-free roadway. The neighborhood is home to many car owners who have expressed frustration to petitioning volunteers and on a neighborhood Facebook page about how difficult it is for them to find free storage for their private vehicles.<br /><br />Others point out that there are many schools on the strip — then make the counter-intuitive point that a car-free street is somehow more dangerous for the school-age pedestrian commuters.<br /><br />“There are many schools on 34th Avenue, therefore weekdays, it should not be a permanent walk way,” wrote Barbara Goldman. “Also, it makes it difficult for teachers to find parking.”<br /><br />Another resident, who gave the name Nina Starz, gave the Marie Antoinette response: Let them move to the suburbs!<br /><br />“I’m sorry, I understand that people want outdoor areas, but if that’s the case consider moving out of the city,” she wrote. “You have so many sidewalks to walk your little hearts away, so it is not fair to limit traffic for cars when you have much space to walk.”<br /><br />Many residents responded back that sidewalks represent a tiny fraction of the neighborhood’s public space — and are certainly no replacement for true open space in a neighborhood with but one central gathering place, the small Travers Park.<br /><br />“We are so grateful for the open road!” wrote Rebecca Mehan. “With two young kids, it is difficult to stay inside all day. The open road gives us a safe place to walk/run/scoot/bike outside without needing to leave the neighborhood. Moreover, it connects us with our community . It is so uplifting to see and move with all of our neighbors. We will use it in the heat, rain, and snow. I hope it can remain open to pedestrians long past our current situation.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, the debate over 34th Avenue will likely grow to include other neighborhoods. In Inwood, for example, a local mom got 600 signatures on her petition to restore Margaret Corbin Drive to car-free status after the city unceremoniously ended the open-street program there in August. And members of Community Boards 2 and 4, which cover adjoining sections of the West Side and Lower Manhattan, have long advocated for more streets to be made off limits to cars.<br /><br />Meanwhile, several groups are working on petitions calling for the open streets on Avenue B in Manhattan and Berry Street in Brooklyn to be permanently car-free.<br /><br />The Meatpacking Business Improvement District showed off what such a street could look like this weekend — to rapturous support from residents, visitors and local businesses, as Streetsblog reported.<br /><br />The Department of Transportation did not respond directly to Dromm’s letter, but told Streetsblog in an anodyne statement, “We are excited about the success of the open street, and we look forward to working with the community on the future of 34th Avenue.”<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The way that the street was initially closed without any debate or consultation has created the perception that the topic was not open to debate. <br /><br />And the way that some people are asking for the street to remain closed indefinitely but still without any consideration or consultation with the people who are negatively affected by the closure is just making things worse. <br /><br />I actually think having an open street is a pretty cool idea but the way this has been done so far makes me very distrustful of some of the open street campaigners. They seem very selfish to me.

They don&#039;t seem to need 34th as a through street to serve the residents on that avenue.

				I hear a lot of discussion about how double parked cars need to be better managed across the board in Jackson Heights. Clearly this has been a long standing issue that predates 34th Ave being closed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently I noticed a sign for a neighborhood loading zone. It was a large two or three car parking space on 74th St somewhere between 37th Ave and 31st Ave that was designated to ease double parking. More here: https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml This space was on a residential block nowhere near any businesses. I believe it was for a window of time like 6am to 6pm maybe? Why can we not have more of these throughout the neighborhood? <br /><br />And to the person who called open street campaigners &quot;selfish,&quot; I would counter that people who own and park their cars for free on these streets are the selfish ones. Why does a group of individual drivers feel entitled to the rights of that space, over an entire&nbsp;community benefiting from it being open?&nbsp;

				I agree emphatically with those last two posts.&nbsp; Delivery trucks safely and legally park in the intersection, an even better solution than the usual double parking on busy streets.&nbsp; The very few parking spaces are also easily accessed by locals who choose to seek them out.&nbsp; And the traffic on Northern and 35th Avenues hasn&#039;t been all that bad and might reduce the non-locals who choose to use our neighborhood as a major thoroughfare.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The tradeoff for a negligible and much overstated inconvenience on all three fronts is that parents can take their kids for safe walks and bicycle rides, safe from both cars and unsafe and potentially unhealthy proximity to others.&nbsp; It means fresh air, exercise, mental health, safety and community during a time when we&#039;re cooped up and those qualities are desperately needed in ways we could have never imagined.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t really seem like an unfair tradeoff at all.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that our locally elected officials will keep 34th Avenue safe, open, regulated and allow it to continue to be the immeasurable gift to the neighborhood that it has been this past summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;We desperately need and deserve it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Mount a phone campaign to their local offices so people like you have their voices heard.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like the program, and didn&#039;t like it back in March and April when this discussion was happening, perhaps it&#039;s worth considering either that your side didn&#039;t have as big a voice or it&#039;s not as big as you imagine to be. <br /><br />There absolutely was a process - one involving a pilot program in march, which was initially opposed by the mayor. People spoke up and advocated to their local representatives at the city and state level that it was a good idea and organized local community groups to manage the closed street. Those folks prevailed. People who didn&#039;t like it, didn&#039;t. Maybe there&#039;s some insight to be drawn from that about the relative support your position has in the neighborhood.<br /><br />

I am not against them, I am saying we should do something to make it better for everyone, especially those complaint about closure. Maybe something similar to Zipcar spot, section some spot off on few street for standing delivery vehicle only. It seem like most of the congestion occurs 74 to mid 80s, so maybe we restrict no parking on one side during certain hours, so similar to Northern where no parking during rush hour.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;With so few people actually using the 34th Ave Open Street in many hours of the day, even on some of the nicer days, closing the street from 8am- 8pm seems like a big ask from the city and not exactly strategic.

				So two things.<br /><br />temujin, This program you describe already exists here and elsewhere in the city, though only on one JH block so far (74th St from 37th Ave to 31st Ave) at different intervals. I did an earlier post about this in this thread, but here&#039;s the link to the neighborhood loading zones program. Why not add more of these? https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml<br /><br />Secondly, 34th Ave and JH is highlighted in this NYT story checking in about where we are as a city at the six month mark of the Covid pandemic.&nbsp; https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-six-months.html

				Does anyone know what the latest is on this? Perhaps I missed it somewhere in this thread. <br /><br />But when is 34th Avenue scheduled to re-open to car traffic? Or has the closure been extended indefinitely? I know there was a petition, but not sure what happened with that.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know where to get the latest concrete info on this.

				I do think that for a decision to make sense it has to be thought out and studied. <br />As an Urban Designer and neighbor or JH I think it is very important to increase the open public spaces <br />that prioritize de pedestrians and not cars. But this does not mean that transportation should be integrated or thought about.<br />It should be an integrated planning process without a doubt.&nbsp; With that said Parking in the streets have to be<br />thought about as well as we have seen an increase in delivery services that should have designated areas so they don&#039;t block avenues or streets.<br />I have seen many Amazon, Fedex, UPS and USPS trucks block a whole street while ambulances or buses need to go through. <br />The streets should not prioritize single user transportation. It should prioritize the community, its services and our neighborhood

				I wouldn&#039;t say everyone wants this!&nbsp; i enjoy using the open streets, but it is often NOT crowded and it does create congestion on other streets certain times of the day.&nbsp; Hopefully DOT does a thorough review along with our community leaders.&nbsp; Traffic violations with double parking, horn honking, the increase in delivery trucks--all are impacting quality of life and the closure of 34th Avenue is making it worse (not better).&nbsp; As winter approaches, and people are getting on with school and work, not sure if having the street closed every day makes the most sense...perhaps weekends is a better compromise.&nbsp;

				i believe that holding the meeting is legal, as the committee meets on a regular basis. i also believe that the meeting has been on the board&#039;s calendar for a full month (if not longer -- i tend to look at the calendar at the first of the month). i also don&#039;t see how you&#039;ve figured the shopping stretch of 73rd and 74th -- nowhere near 34th avenue -- into your argument, which seems to be growing more and more strident with each passing day.

				The opinions of people who do not live adjacent to the closed street should not matter.&nbsp; This is an attraction to them, but a nuisance to many who live along 34th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like all public projects, there should be an environmental study done at monumental cost to ensure no native endangered species are affected, like the Jackson Heights hawk and the tamed squirrels.<br /><br />Then it should be sent to committee and tabled.&nbsp; Once it comes up for a vote in 4 or 5 years, the people using it now will have sold and moved out to the next hot neighborhood and the real residents can decide.<br /><br />Extending the pilot program for further study is fine with me, but making it permanent without making better arrangements than expecting a committee of volunteers to maintain it is not OK.&nbsp; Every time I move my car for the stupid alternate side annoyance I have to move the barricades aside by myself, and I still worry about emergency vehicles getting access to 78th Street and now 79th Street on Sundays.<br /><br />Of course if you want to move the open street to your own street, feel free.<br />

				I LOVE Open Streets, and yes, I signed the petition to make them permanent, in whatever way makes sense (e.g., seasonal, on a schedule etc.). I see a lot of people who live on 34th enjoy it daily, and I don&#039;t see insurmountable problems with traffic etc. I see people embracing the open space and owning their streets, as opposed to ceding them to traffic. It&#039;s beautiful.<br /><br />I also want to remind everyone that similar comments appeared when it was proposed to have 78th street close, when it was proposed to make that permanent, to have the park extended, to have the market there etc. A vocal minority at the time also raised all kinds of concerns but I think the results speak for themselves.
