				I&#039;ve heard from two different sources that the bagel shop owner on 37th Ave. (80s) is considering converting the shop into a Greek restaurant with outdoor seating.&nbsp; According to what I was told, permits for the conversion are pending.&nbsp; Does anyone have more information on this?&nbsp; It would be great for the community, as the only local option for Greek food is Plaka in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s true!

				The way I heard the owner explain it, it sounded like it was going to be a Greek diner.&nbsp; This was several months ago, and at the time it seemed like the change was imminent, but there has been no outward progress.&nbsp; I am hopeful though

				Do you mean Bagel store on corner of 86th and 37th Street?<br /><br />Also, does anyone know what is coming in on the opposite corner that is under (where Dragon Seed was)?

				Great if he expands so there&#039;s outside seating; I just hope I&#039;ll still be able to pick up one of his bagel sandwiches on Saturday and Sunday mornings.<br /><br />Like earbears, curious about what&#039;s happening with the fairly major construction project on the other side of 86th Street.

				I hope it&#039;s more restaurant, less diner. I actually can&#039;t conceive of a diner with outdoor seating.

				It seems a little small to expand into a restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been wondering how they can stay in business. I would be happy if we just had a good bagel place there - 3 bagel places in the neighborhood and not a bagel worth eating,&nbsp; even in Forest Hills, the bagels are hit and miss.&nbsp; A good Greek restaurant would be wonderful too.
