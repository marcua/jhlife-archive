				The IKEA Brooklyn ferry is back in service and they now have one going from Midtown, at W 39th and 11th. This is on weekends only https://www.nywaterway.com/ikea.aspx<br /><br />Despite having to go much further to the IKEA Brooklyn, I still think it&#039;s a better bet than the small one in Queens.

Depends on whether you enjoy ferries, I guess. I personally enjoy ferries, and bonus points for free ferries. The 7 train goes to 34th and 11th Ave, and the Midtown ferry location is 39th and 11th. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like ferries, then be my guest and sit on the F train for 45 minutes, and then when you get off the F, still have to wait for a shuttle bus or walk 20 minutes to get to IKEA. The ferry, on the other hand, goes directly to IKEA.<br /><br />

				I agree that ferries in NYC in summer are amazing<br /><br /><br />Please don&#039;t let a few folks who can&#039;t find joy in simple pleasures dissuade you from posting cool stuff. <br /><br />I thank you for letting me know about the free ferry returning. And I look forward to the ride.

Yes, now the link is working.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for posting information in this forum to share resources. It may work for some people and may not work for other people, but it is OK.
