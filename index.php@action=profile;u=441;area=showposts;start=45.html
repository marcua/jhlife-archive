					We actually know quite a bit about SARS. We have dealt with SARS coronaviruses before -- in 2003 SARS-CoV and MERS in 2012 prior to SARS-CoV-2 (the disease is COVID-19).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/424121a" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/424121a</a><br /><br />The above article from 2003 is general public information, but if you prefer a more scientific read, the works cited are research articles.<br /><br />SARS(2002-2004) did in fact wane drastically as seasons changed. China is currently reporting fewer and fewer new infections.<br /><br />Children especially babies are either not infected or experience little to no distress from COVID-19. I think the link to plumbing/aerosol-suspension of virus (see Nature article) should be further explored, as Italy has extensive use of bidet toilets and is infected widely, well beyond the aged. Babies and young children don&#039;t use the bidet toilet fixture. That&#039;s my take (I get a lot of flack on this forum for thinking outside the box). Beyond that, we know respiratory droplets is key to transmission of the pathogen, but COVID-19, the disease, was spread through travel: planes and ships took COVID around the world.<br /><br />The BIG question is immunity going forward. Will COVID act like flu and mutate enough each season so as to reinfect people yearly.<br />

					At the Elmhurst meeting the MTA provided a new version of our proposed bus map. There&#039;s no online link provided and it&#039;s hard to read (very teeny tiny print), but it scopes Queens in its entirety. The routes are in color and it is plain to see:<br /><br />One bus, the QT61, goes into Manhattan over the 59th Street Bridge. <br />As you know, most Queens lines go north-south. The major lines, LIC and Astoria-- QT1 and QT2 respectively, run the entire N-S corridor to Brooklyn. <br />The QT4 also goes to Brooklyn, but does not run the full NS Qns corridor. Ditto for QT6, QT58 and QT52. You&#039;re in luck if you&#039;re traveling to Brooklyn. <br />Most of Queens is full of short, straight, N-S routes that serve as connectors.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a ballsy social engineering plan.

					Here&#039;s a friendly reminder to submit a Queens Bus Redesign complaint or suggestion.<br /><br /><a href="https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus</a><br /><br />So far the MTA has received ~800 online comments from the JH area. Handwritten comments are being collected but based on what was said by a representative at the Elmhurst meeting, the MTA is focused on the online feedback. The rep chose a few to read out loud to the audience, but all contained some words of positive reinforcement of their plan.<br /><br />You might want to shy away from making positive comments. We all want to be nice about this, but unless you absolutely love the redesign, don&#039;t play into their hands. The host of the recent Elmhurst community meeting did just that. <br /><br />Per an email, this is Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz&#039;s position: <br /><br />About <strong>Slow Service and the Need for Improvements to Their Commutes</strong>...to share information about the redesign and facilitate constructive feedback from the riding community....<strong>Queens buses are slow and unreliable</strong>.<br /><br />Cruz&#039;s voice is powerful. These are her words. She repeated them forcefully at the meeting. Please think about whether it&#039;s in your best interest to echo them. <br /><br />Thank you.<br />Jeanette

					I&#039;ve been to Salchi-Taco a few times for their fries and coffee. <br /><br />The owner, Roberto, who is very welcoming, says he is not just a restaurateur, but also the hot sauce creator and entrepreneur. I don&#039;t eat hot sauce, but it sounds like it would be good if that&#039;s your thing. Roberto emailed me this cute documentary about his business. He is very prideful and earnest, and was disappointed in reading a negative review about Salchi-Taco on this thread. He told me he plans to set up a full hot sauce bar in the restaurant. It&#039;s a work in progress.<br /><br />Give him a chance; his story is compelling.<br /><a href="https://vimeo.com/333556964/c0b1afa328" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/333556964/c0b1afa328</a><br /><br />Three tidbits: Roberto&#039;s a friend of Dominic/Sacs; Salchi-Taco does sell salchipapas; they offer all-day breakfast/egg dish fare.

					The next feedback session involving this area and some of our bus routes will be next Wednesday, March 4th, 6 to 8 PM, Elmhurst Hospital, 79-01 Broadway 11373. I believe the Q49&#039;s replacement would be the QT74, which travels to Elmhurst Hospital. The Q33 is an Elmhurst route. Many others, I&#039;m sure, but the maps are confusing to me.<br /><br />April 1st is the last public session, so presumably all communities can continue to provide feedback throughout March.<br /><br />Sarah Feinberg, Byford&#039;s replacement, takes over the post next week just days after the Elmhurst meeting. <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/25/mta-announces-interim-bus-and-subways-chief-sarah-feinberg/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2020/02/25/mta-announces-interim-bus-and-subways-chief-sarah-feinberg/</a><br /><br />Final note: if you only made your voice heard via petition(s) or politician&#039;s staff, please repeat your feedback directly onto this page: <a href="https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus</a><br />It can be a general comment or specific to a bus number. <br />Tell your neighbors how/where to comment.

The room was full. The attendees were not happy. The MTA reps were unconvincing. Again, we were told that MTA has already surveyed riders and concluded that we don’t like our buses, to which the entire room exploded with “liars” “never” and “WHY are you doing this?”<br /><br />What I learned and some additional points:<br /><br />1. As is the case in Jackson Heights, Sunnyside’s East-West routes are being decimated. LIC/SS will lose the Q32 to Manhattan.<br /><br />2. The new LIC/Sunnyside grid is North-South and the best and most frequent routes travel to Brooklyn. Looking at the map, it is obvious that redistribution of services is the goal.<br /><br />3. When terror attacks, blackouts, bad weather, crumbling infrastructure, sick passengers/crimes, and protests (apparently the new favorite youth pastime) occur, Queens needs an alternative to the 7 train.<br /><br />4. Not one attendee said they had been approached, informed, surveyed or leafleted by MTA/CTA.<br /><br />5. One of the two MTA reps used a very telling term. She called the plan “’transformative’ to accommodate the future” (something to that effect). Sure would be nice if they would just clue us in on their plans for our future.<br />&nbsp; <br />6. St. Sebastian’s RC Church may do something to advertise its dissatisfaction with MTA’s Queens Bus Redesign. I will post here if any plans materialize that you might want to participate in.&nbsp; <br /><br />Feel free to use anything I typed here for your feedback to MTA. <a href="https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus</a><br /><br />Thank you.<br />Jeanette

					Last Thursday’s JH/Corona feedback session was extremely well attended (packed). Hearing neighbors’ concerns was helpful, I think. Will it impact MTA’s bus redesign? I don’t know. Be wary of the power of suggestion. It bothers me that in MTA’s opening salvo we are told how unhappy we are with our buses-- ridership is down, and that their plan is what we really want. It should be put to us: “Are you willing to forgo your buses in exchange for such and such benefit?” Keep a clear head. Half the people at my table echoed MTA’s leading introduction, giving the MTA exactly what it wanted to hear.<br /><br />Some additional or clarified ideas I gleaned from the session:<br /><br />1. The proposed new routes are on dark leafy sleepy residential streets and warrant longer walking distances. The DOT will need to provide better lighting. With less people and no businesses to encounter, traveling in the wee hours will expose travelers to heightened risks, not just to crime but also for some--injuries and for the elderly--exhaustion. <br /><br />2. Revenue neutrality is a deceptive construct when reduced services are actually paying for the new fleet of buses including $2.2milllion (each) for electric buses.<br /><br />3. What guarantees are there that buses will no longer be crowded and bunched? Are they proposing double-deckers or accordions? If so, how will that impact our beloved trees?<br /><br />4. Don’t confuse faster buses with faster commutes. I previously posted a thorough explanation on bus stop distancing and travel speed by a former MTA bus planner: <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19619.msg97413#msg97413" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19619.msg97413#msg97413</a><br />*Adding input from a participant in a wheelchair: <strong>the increase in wheelchair transfers will be a true burden for disabled riders</strong> as well as strip away any seconds you think you saved. <br /><br />5. The draft looks to me like it will LOWER bus ridership (it will in my case), defying one of the main objectives.<br /><br />6. By bypassing our shops, places of worship, local doctors/dentists in favor of Manhattan and destination routes, group segregation and social stratification will intensify and negatively affect the vibrancy, allure and potential expansion of the landmark district.<br /><br />7. Build the elevators first, then talk about local train destinations. Because if they don’t work, are smelly, dangerous, scratch-itti’d, and you have to wait for what seems like an eternity, that’s not doing those who need them any favors. <br /><br />8. “MTA&#039;s proposed redesign is the result of a serious research and planning effort.” This is wrong. I ride the buses. I was never approached, informed, surveyed or leafleted by MTA/CTA. There has been no outreach to people whose first language is not English. That is FACT.<br /><br />9. As we know, carless routes (14th Street Project) and/or elimination of parking is firmly affixed in the frontal lobe of politicians, yet is not being broached whatsoever by the MTA.&nbsp; Such transformation is expected and should be considered as part of the equation. To not do so is dishonest.<br /><br />10. Ask yourself, how will MTA maintain anything while expanding reduced fares and with the fare-less/fare theft mindset of an increasingly socialist society?<br /><br />11. Personally, unless MTA/NYCTA proves it cares about increasing ridership OR our comforts, or rather admits that this bus redesign is for the sake of climate change/GND, I have no faith that MTA is being forthright.<br /><br />Please consider the above as an expansion of the concerns previously posted by Earbears:<br />-The elimination of the Q49, Q33 and Q32 bus routes will have drastic negative impacts on the Jackson Heights community.<br />-There will no longer be any busses going east-west to take people to and from the 74th Street Roosevelt ave subway station. It will prohibit people living within a wide neighborhood from traveling east-west.<br />-This will be a severe detriment to the entire neighborhood and especially to older adults, people with disabilities, people with young children, and families taking their children to and from our local schools.<br />-This redesign will create inequity in our neighborhood and leave vulnerable populations stranded, unable to access the subway and the wider community.<br /><br />Feel free to use anything I typed here as your feedback. Please post your feedback more than once. Post often. The sooner the better. <a href="https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/comments_queensbus</a><br /><br />Thank you.<br />Jeanette<br />PS I typed this whole thing out early this morning and just as I was about to send, I lost it all, lol. Had to recreate it. (I’m still missing one of my points.)<br />

Another protest against fares, the MTA, and cops is scheduled for 5-p.m.-or-so this evening in Grand Central and other locations.<br /><br />As an alternative, the Q32 travels through midtown along Madison Avenue and will bring you to the heart of Jackson Heights.
