				Just read a post that Maram pharmacy on 37th avenue is closing. If this is true it is a big loss for the neighborhood. One of the few places left where people know your name.

				Sorry but I have to confirm that Maram is closing on Sunday, The large chain stores and the rents were too much and they couldn&#039;t continue. A great loss for JH.<br /><br />We stopped by the other day and thanked them for everything them did to keep us healthy. It would be great is all who see this stop by and tell them they will be missed.<br /><br />Andrienne will be at Rite Aid on 83rd and 37th. All prescriptions are being transfer there also.<br />

				Oh, no! I thought they were just changing the window display. I really appreciated that place, and kept a regular prescription there rather than do the cheaper mail-order for which my insurance gave a better rate. With all the new pharmacies popping up in the neighborhood, this one has to close? And with no announcement?

				I really like B&amp;B, located between 81st and 80th on 37th. They are an independent drug store. They fought with my health insurance/medicare company when they (United Health) decided I didn&#039;t exist. Obviously, I do. <br /><br />They also&nbsp; give good advice and discounts if they think the drugs are too expensive.<br /><br />Elena, the pharmacist is great and very knowledgeable. I give them 2 thumbs up.

				I loved Maram but I think it is total BS that Rite Aid purchased customer&#039;s prescription information and possible insurance history. Customers should be given the opportunity to opt out of this transfer of what most people believe to be confidential information.

				they&#039;re saying &#039;we&#039;ve chosen rite aid for you.&#039;<br /><br />not for them to decide. <br /><br />yeah, it&#039;s simple enough to avoid using the chain with an effort, but why not simply inform the customer of your choice to go out of business -- guessing they didn&#039;t simply decide 24 hours before-- and let him or her choose?

				Yes I have.<br /><br />And I think he could have told customers in a mailing or when they came in for refills. Maram was always a nice place and they will be missed . Just think he could have sent people to another mom and pop rather than reward the chains that hurt his business

				I believe that up until a few years ago some chain pharmacies were selling <br />&quot;anonymous&quot; bundles of customer records to marketing groups who would then target the consumer with this information. This is no longer legal (not what Maram did) just mentioning what some pharmacies used to practice. It could simply be that refills are on file at Rite Aid (which is a major convenience for some people) a sick or unwell elderly person does not want to lose their refills and have to go to back to the doctor or deal with insurance info again which can be confusing. However, some people have their reasons to not want that information accessible at every pharmacy within their network and even larger databases. The ability to opt out should be respected by rite-aid.

				If I remember correctly, the former Maram site was actually comprised of 2 or 3 smaller storefronts.&nbsp; So, given this is Jackson Heights, I imagine the old rent was probably $10,000 to $15,000 per month.&nbsp; Either the property owner will re-divide the space, or find the next business (we must wait with baited breath to see what that is) who is willing to pay that freight. It is a very busy corner with a lot of foot traffic, which is why our commercial landlords can command such huge rents.&nbsp; Let us all pray.&nbsp; At least it is in the historic district so we won&#039;t have a huge awning, and 25 signs attached to the parapet.
