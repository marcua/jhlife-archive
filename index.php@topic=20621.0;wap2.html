			The International Animal Clinic was established in 1984 in Jackson heights. Ever since then we have been committed to providing quality health services to pets and owners. <br />We specialize in dogs and cats. <br /><br />Our services include routine physical and wellness examinations, vaccinations, diet consultations, general and specialized surgeries, and routine dental cleanings. We also provide surgical consultations (secondary opinions). Not only that but we have our own inhouse diagnostics, including digital x-ray and sonograms.<br /><br />For the convenience of our patients and clients, the clinic has it&#039;s own pharmacy that is stocked with carefully selected health products. We also sell an assortment of Hill&#039;s Prescription Diet food for both dogs and cats. We accept walk-in patients during the hours of operation, but scheduling an appointment is highly suggested.<br /><br />The address is 3233 Junction Blvd Jackson Heights, NY 11369<br />Our instagram page is @iacurgentcare<br />Call (718) 507-5600 for consultations.<br />Speak English &amp; Spanish<br />Our vet is Dr. David Arias DVM
