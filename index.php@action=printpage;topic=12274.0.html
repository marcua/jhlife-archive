				Title: <strong>Seeking P/T nanny for 4yo girl</strong><br />

				We are looking for a p/t nanny for our 4-year-old daughter. We are hoping to find someone who can stay with us for at least one year and possibly 2 or 3 years. This position could be ideal for a responsible P/T college student studying to be a teacher, or a SAHM with one child who lives in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Our daughter is very exuberant, energetic and passionate. She loves to read (and reads fluently), play games, do gymnastics, and play outdoors at the playground. She has been raised according to the parenting style described on the site ahaparenting. com, and our nanny would be willing to employ this style of compassionate discipline. Our daughter is very sociable, well liked by her peers, and would be a good fit for a nanny that enjoys spending time with other children and sitters/moms, and is proactive about arranging after school playdates / going to the playground 1 or 2x a week. Our daughter is strong willed and would do best with someone with patience, calm, and kindness. <br /><br />We have two cats in the home. Candidate must be ultra-reliable and be willing to take care of our daughter if she is sick, as I am a violin teacher who cannot cancel lessons. Our previous nanny candidate didn&#039;t work out, so we are looking to find someone who can start by 8/15. <br /><br />4:00- pick up from school<br />4:30 - home or afterschool playdate/playground<br />7 - 7:30 dinner<br />7:30 - bedtime routine / play<br /><br />Some light housekeeping is involved -- merely leaving the home in the condition in which you arrive. Ideally, the nanny would help the child develop her own clean up skills in a fun, loving way.<br /><br />We are looking for a caregiver who is loving and affectionate, someone who clearly takes on the adult role, but who is flexible and reasonable. Someone who has good emotional regulation skills. Responsibilities would include meal prep (heating up a prepared meal, making sandwiches). <br /><br />We would consider a nanny who wants to watch our daughter alongside her own similar-aged child. <br /><br />We have a strong preference for a local candidate (Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Woodside, Sunnyside, East Elmhurst, Corona, Astoria).
