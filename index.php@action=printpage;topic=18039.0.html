				It seems that the site located at 73rd and Broadway has been sold. The developer plans to demolish the site. I guess he liked the new Diversity Plaza because he paid over $50 million.

				I think it is more proof that the spike in land prices in LIC has caused developers to study the subway map and look at land one subway stop over. The rents in LIC are out of control so it really was just a matter of time before more development came to Jackson Heights.

This site is very expensive and Sterling is not doing the kind of volume that Long Island or Astoria did in the same location. The overhead in JH is tremendous with all the counterfeit bills being passed and the drug money being laundered. I&#039;m fairly certain Sterling will move to a smaller location with lower taxes or rent. I think this is just another case of a property being worth more than the business and Sterling having a hard time competing with the larger banks. But this is just a hunch on my part. Maybe they really are closing because the restaurant next door is parking his customers&#039; cars in the lot after banking hours.

				It costs too much in property taxes to operate that location. Banks are in the business of lending money not developing real estate. Can’t wait for all those food carts to be gone. Hopefully it will control the rat population and clean the area.

				73 and 74th are not exactly on the flight path but even 15 or 20 floors would change the area. It is interesting that to note that the local government has recently prohibited hotels in LIC because they are not allowed in Manufacturing or Residential zones. So since this area in JH is zoned Commercial, developers looking to build hotels are coming to these streets. I heard that there are three hotels already in the works. This change in the zoning law pushed by our mayor means that JH will be overrun with hotels. Also note we have the bus nearby&nbsp; to the LGA.

				The area in blue is where hotels can now and after the new regulations take effect can be built “as a right”. The new regulations will close huge areas where there are new hotels just opening up (like in Ravenswood) to further hotel development. Since most of the land in East Elmhurst is already built with hotels, the only place I see that could see a hotel boom is Jackson Heights 72nd Street to 74th Street as shown on the map. The city has record tourists visiting (65 million a year) and the new Airbnb Law will drastically reduce illegal listings. As to height, the area can easy see 15 ( as being built on 72nd ) to twenty stories and is not at all on the flight path to LGA. Most people think that all of JH is closed to tall buildings but that is false.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It will be a commercial 6 story office building with stores. A hotel is always a possibility given the changes in zoning law as above. Also the size would allow a hotel. The owner also owns the triangle building across the street with the law firm. Expect something very big because $14 million is a lot of money to invest in that piece of land and the owner surely will expect a return.
