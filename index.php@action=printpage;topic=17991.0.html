				Let&#039;s assume<strong> most generously</strong> that the going rate for a<em> basement </em> JH 2br with all utilities is $2,300 pm.<br /><br />That&#039;s $27.5k..... but as it&#039;s a &quot;before tax&quot; value, that corresponds to say, $35k gross wages in nyc. Still! Do they think this is a full-time job?<br /><br />----<br />Perhaps they intend to pay them off the books....because they ain&#039;t getting a real super for that. <br />----<br /><br />Realistically, For a 10 unit building to have a super live in, I would expect maintenance costs of for <strong>every </strong>apartment to increase by $200pm (if they were lucky) <strong> just to pay for the super and their benefits.....</strong><br /><br />Also: lenniefeldman@gmail.com : you are googleable with that email!<br />

				No, it&#039;s not a joke--it&#039;s the way many coops in JH have operated for many years. The super gets a free apartment in exchange for basically janitorial duties. The super often has another job and performs the cleaning/maintenance duties on the side in exchange for the apartment. It is not a full time job--it&#039;s a side gig: free rent in exchange for cleaning duties. It&#039;s a good enough deal for many people, who can often save enough this way to be able to put a down payment on a house somewhere else (our former supers did that) after a few years. We are also seeking a super, as a matter of fact. Private message me if you know of --or are--a possible candidate. We are also a 10-unit building, but our job specs might be a bit different than what the OP listed.

				No--it&#039;s not a full time job--it&#039;s free rent in exchange for cleaning duties. Many supers stay in these jobs for years, and the jobs are always in demand. <br /><br />It&#039;s not terribly time consuming--the super can hold down a separate job somewhere else. The buildings are small and they don&#039;t need a full time staff. <br /><br />Why is this so surprising? We are not talking about the super for a building with hundreds of apartments. The deal involves putting out the garbage and mopping down the hallways and other common areas, and shoveling snow as needed. Anything else the super does is generally compensated separately. It is not intended as a full time job. Some buildings hire an off-premises super to come in and perform the duties, and rent out the super apartment. Others--like ours--do the free apartment in exchange for cleaning duties deal.

				Didn&#039;t expect this to be a controversial post, but I guess you never know with this site! LJR did a good job of explaining the logic.&nbsp; Sorry if I was insufficiently clear that this was not a full-time job. I thought the list of duties and the number of units in the coop would make that pretty clear.

				I scrolled through the posted law and see that the free rent can be considered part of the minimum wage. And that the law still ties the amount of rent allowed for this to average rents in 1975! That&#039;s pretty crazy.

Sometimes I wonder why it is even in the wage order.

				I moved out of a 28 unit cooperative building in Jackson Heights in 2006 where the Super had a 2BR 1BA unit plus was paid $250 a month.&nbsp; After I left the Super resigned and the apartment was furnished and rented.&nbsp; They hired a replacement who worked a few hours a day x 5 days a week.&nbsp; The rental income covered the new super plus there was a substantial surplus.&nbsp;
