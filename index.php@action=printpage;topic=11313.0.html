				The sabor taco truck was my favorite tacos ever and now it&#039;s gone. Did Famiglias push ten out if their spot?&nbsp; This is very depressing as the tacos were miles above some chain pizza crap. Anyone know where they moved to?<br /><br />Thanks

				famiglia drove all of the mexican trucks off, which makes sense, given the poor quality of the pizza they sell. i think sabor moved a block up, and to the other side of the street, at 76th. not sure where el gallo giro or the third one (with tamales, which was my favorite) ended up.<br /><br />try the place in front of chase. they have some excellent offerings, especially the quesadillas.

				Hmmm. The good truck (sabor) is nowhere on Roosevelt. It was on 76th/Roosevelt for a couple weeks but has since disappeared. The one you mentioned is still there but was too salty for my tastes. There&#039;s a larger truck now that used to be by chase on Roos/75th. Maybe I&#039;ll try that one. Corporate America screws us again!!

				I am curious: what does that mean that the pizzeria &quot;drove them off&quot;? Did they report them for violations? Or threaten to? Anybody know?

				I&#039;m pretty sure a business like a pizzeria can ask the city to make food vendors move from right in front of their business. Not totally unreasonable.&nbsp; I do love how it took Famiglia about 3 years to open, I wonder what the deal was with that? I can&#039;t imagine ever getting food there, the taco trucks are delicious. I didn&#039;t move here to eat subpar chain pizza. If you want good pizza go to Louie&#039;s on Baxter Ave.&nbsp; The Sabor cart that used to be there has been replaced by a larger truck which is usually parked a block East on the same side of Roosevelt. I don&#039;t know if the truck says Sabor on it but it is undoubtedly the same food and same people working. (can you tell I eat lots of tacos?)&nbsp; Gallo Giro is another block further East, same side of Roosevelt.&nbsp;

				on the bright side, i&#039;ve never seen more than three or four tables occupied at famous famiglia. guessing they have 9-12 months.

				Wow, harsh!&nbsp; I&#039;d rather have a mediocre chain than a huge empty space.&nbsp; And they employ a lot of people from our area who would probably like to keep their jobs.

				i definitely don&#039;t want an empty space. but i&#039;d prefer either<br />a) a mediocre place that doesn&#039;t muscle out decent food<br />or<br />b) actual decent food in the space.

				For me? I&#039;m thrilled to see no taco truck and a barrier free street. I don&#039;t eat food off of trucks and I haven&#039;t found one good pizzeria here...including Louie&#039;s that everyone seems to rave about. It&#039;s doubtful that I will ever eat at La Familglia either. The one place that I liked had a short lived life on Northern. I forget the name now ...pappagallo or something like that. It had a&nbsp; true thin crust crispy pizza like you would find in Italy.

Compare that to Grand Central. Not only beautiful but the food is top notch. I don&#039;t think we should be happy as just a transit hub, we can be better than that. <br /><br /><br />Also, considering that La Familiglia spent years entirely closed, they&#039;ll probably last at least 3 years with slow business before they start thinking about what they&#039;ve done. Compare that to La Abunduncia across the street who do a ton of business, or Friends Cafe who are constantly packed.<br /><br />

				I gotta say, I agree with the previously posted stuff about keeping the sidewalks clear in front of the transit hub.&nbsp; The taco trucks and carts have only be required to move a short distance down Roosevelt.&nbsp; <br />

				Thanks for the info guys. I will check out the bigger truck. And I have no evidence that Famiglia &quot;muscled&quot; anyone out but I thinks that goes without saying. They open and everyone&#039;s moved. Not rocket science.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also screw these planes and the FAA. Did the town hall meeting do nothing?

				I don&#039;t think anyone muscled anyone out.&nbsp; The Q70 now stops where the taco wagon(s), peanut vendors were.

				actually, that&#039;s not true, toque. the 70 stop is where the nut vendor and breakfast cart were. the two taco trucks were all the way to the corner. famiglia was fully responsible for their ouster, as they &quot;left&quot; on the day of the chain&#039;s grand opening.
