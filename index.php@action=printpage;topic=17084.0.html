				This seems to be the going rate. My 8 year old can attest to it, as we witnessed the transaction coming home from the subway last evening, 6PM. <br /><br />Last week, I had to try to wake a drunk guy on the curb where he would have been backed over by the driver of the parked car he was under, and the week before in our own yard, just off Roosevelt I had to explain why a different man was &quot;sleeping&quot; in our entryway. <br /><br />Last week, I also did some excellent rogue gardening, adding to the trees we planted on 90th Roosevelt with 4 large planters of lovely green. <br /><br />I used 311 app for a variety of quality of life and traffic issues that are not being addressed, and beseeched the elected officials to get rid of the moving trucks that are parked around 90th and Roosevelt all day long. <br /><br />Many on this board gave Francisco Moya the council seat. What are your expectations? Do you realize that he&#039;ll appoint the lady who currently answers his phone to the assembly seat? All we get from that is more foot soldiers for Joe Crowley&#039;s empowerment. (I think he does a good job on national issues)<br /><br />So many in this neighborhood are great debaters of national issues and national politics while getting too cozy with the mindset that their property values are rising and rising. At what cost? <br /><br />Is there a Roosevelt Ave coalition that will actually be willing to get this road in order? <br />My family and I are hard-working, declining middle class and most likely months away from making the decision to leave NYC, my home of nearly 30 years. <br /><br />I recently helped a friend move from Harlem to Astoria. She won the affordable housing lottery, which sent her to a low-rent refugee settlement in the stench zone of the East River. It comes with parking and many other settlers who will build up that part of Astoria where single family homes are slowly getting sold off. It&#039;s depressing as hell that this is the method for affordable housing, when beautiful communities like ours, Elmhurst and Corona and East Elmhurst have sustained generations of good families. <br />Until now. <br />I do recognize that the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s must have been worse in so many ways, but I can&#039;t imagine how our elected&#039;s and community members are willing to let us go backwards so fully. <br /><br /><br />

				Agree the points being made by the OP are not at all clear in this kind of rambling, vague post. How do rising property values equate to neglect of quality of life issues in the neighborhood? Is the point that people are just so happy with their rising property values that they don&#039;t care and are not trying to address the issues she is bringing up?&nbsp; And what&#039;s the bit about the woman who answers Moya&#039;s phone? Please clarify.

Every single NYC neighborhood has its flaws; it&#039;s a consequence of living in such a densely populated, hyper-competitive, dog-eat-dog city with all different types of people and personalities. It&#039;s a personal choice - for one and one&#039;s family - to see the beauty or the pain in it, and to respond accordingly. That being said, generally speaking, I would say that more and more people want to come to and be in NYC, rather than leave.

				&nbsp;But was your housings as cheap as could be? We got an amazing deal in real estate here some years ago.

				The point is, who is doing anything to improve Roosevelt Avenue? <br />I would think that as development and gentrification come so would stronger efforts to clean up the area that the effects would stretch to surrounding streets. One can still find condoms and needles on these blocks. <br /><br />There are very few places where one can cross from such luxury to abject poverty as quickly as from 35th Ave to Roosevelt, and I am puzzled how people rationalize this to their children, or harp incessantly about national politics when the rift between communities right here just deepens and deepens. <br /><br />I&#039;m certain P.S.69 is a diverse school but zoning makes it a very targeted sample. It will lose it&#039;s Title 1 Status soon, with only 56% receiving free lunch. It also has a much lower Limited English Proficiency than other schools, with just 17.7%. It is also the poster-child school of council member Dromm. <br /><br />There are simple means to clean up Roosevelt such as calling in Consumer affairs, Dept. of Buildings Code Violation Unit, NYPD task force, etc- but it requires a community response that is lacking here. <br />It befuddles me. <br /><br />

				There was a community meeting with police a year or two ago in which a JH resident who works in Elmhurst and repeatedly witnesses arrangements for sex being made on Roosevelt when she went to work at 6:30 - 7 a.m., about an hour after a special police patrol there ended.<br />Supposedly the police were going to accommodate this problem, but it seems the police just are not aware of what&#039;s going on or, if beat cops are aware, the info is not effectively communicated or acted upon.

That&#039;s why the BID was killed: existing business owners were concerned that it was a stalking horse to force them out and replace them with national chains, as has happened on a lot of 82nd. The businesses along Rosie tend to be busy - they&#039;re all rented, not abandoned - and I bet that they fear multiplying their rent a lot more than they fear Senorita Puta leaning against the 7 train pillars. In fact, I&#039;m pretty sure she buys drinks and is part of their community.<br /><br />JH happens to be a bunch of non-overlapping communities who coexist and don&#039;t talk to each other much. But let&#039;s respect that and not try to force the other ones into becoming us. (While advocating for a reduction in things that hurt everyone, like gang violence.)

Schools and street safety are. I was hoping to hear feedback from others who may want to join forces. More than anything, I&#039;m mentally exhausted at the expectation that everything is citizen driven, and those with the full-time occupation of attending to these issues in various agencies and offices, simply don&#039;t. Never. Nada. Never see anyone in power be proactive about these concerns.

				Having been a resident of the neighborhood for almost 25 years, it was pretty grim back in the 90&#039;s.&nbsp; It&#039;s not anywhere near what it was like then but I do feel there&#039;s been a noticeable decline in the last few years, especially as far as quality of life issues go.

				In my opinion the cultural and aesthetic contrasts between blocks ( like 35th Ave and Roosevelt) in Jackson Heights is amazing. And are what makes the neighborhood unique.<br /><br />Kids are particularly lucky. They will grow up to be street smart real New Yorkers. <br /><br />And of course New Yorkers are special in that &#039;seen it all&#039; way.

				Wow...this place was about 500 feet from Dromm&#039;s office.&nbsp; Are there any penalties to the landlords in such cases?&nbsp; I would image that they were being paid a very high amount of rent.&nbsp; Places like this drive up rents so&nbsp; legitimate small budinesses can&#039;t afford to open in places like Jackson Heights.
