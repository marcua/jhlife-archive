				Hi out there....is anyone interested in adopting a pair of peach faced lovebirds?&nbsp; I bought them each from local area pet stores about 2 years ago.&nbsp; They were smaller then so I assume they were babies and that they are about 3 years old now.&nbsp; I think they are a male and female pair as they tend to each other in typical gender roles during mating season, but I cannot be sure of their sexes.&nbsp; They are not hand trained.&nbsp; As with most paired birds, they have each other and therefore little interest in humans.&nbsp; They will, however, chirp when spoken to.&nbsp; Also, if they are in sight when you are eating, they&#039;ll eat with you at the same time.&nbsp; Anyway....I am offering the pair together, their cage and all its contents, and any remaining food I have on hand.&nbsp; They just need a good home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks&nbsp; :)

				My partner and I may be interested if they are still available. May we ask why you are giving them away? Feel free to give me a call at 347.403.1717.<br /><br />Best,<br />John

				<br />Thanks so much for your interest John but I&#039;ve already placed them in a happy home.&nbsp; Luckily my best friend&#039;s parents were able to take them so I still get to ask for periodic updates and such.&nbsp; To answer your question though, I had to give them because my Mom (whom I live with) developed an acute allergy to dust and dander.&nbsp; She was under strict instruction to rid the home of all pets.&nbsp; Thanks again for your interest and good luck in your pet quest.
