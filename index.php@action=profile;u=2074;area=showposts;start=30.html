					What good are the gloves when you have to touch shared door knobs and handles to make your way to the store in the first place? Wouldn&#039;t those same potential virus be on your gloves instead?<br /><br />I could understand for protecting yourself, you can go straight to the garbage and dump them when you get inside and then wash your hands, but I&#039;m not sure what they are doing for others in the pharmacy shelves when they are touching the same surfaces and objects your hands would touch.

					We haven&#039;t left the building in a while, but my wife saw the same thing at the green market last time she was there. People reaching in front of other giving zero f-bombs about distancing.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard enough to do this just walking down sidewalks and trying to use the grocery store/pharmacy. I saw a story where Publix down south instituted ONE WAY traffic in the store aisles to try to stop people from going past each other as much as possible.<br /><br />And a lot of parents use their strollers as weapons to say `where my kid and I are going is more important than where you are going`, why would we expect that to change? It&#039;s a certain mentaliy. I&#039;ve been hit I don&#039;t know how many times in the back of the ankles by parents who still haven&#039;t learned how to drive a stroller or are just being passive aggressive. Those people have already showed you who they were before this pandemic, they&#039;re still those same people, keep believing what their actions told you about them previously.

					There is another report that just came out stating that unlinke SARS or MERS where the viral load is at peak much later in the symptomatic process where people are probably already isolated. Where with COVID-19, peak viral load, or propensity to infect others, is just before symptoms appear or right as they are appearing at their mildest. So there&#039;s a much larger chance that people THINK they are fine but are spreading it with every breath they take and word they speak.

I have older family members who live alone that I would love to visit, but I can&#039;t right now out of concern that I might have this virus and not know it. A trip to a grocery store carries significantly less risk than visiting someone in their home. Like most people, I&#039;m taking extra precautions when I am in public.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m in the same boat, I have a family member in a facility and I don&#039;t know when I&#039;m going to get back there. Even if it&#039;s a hand-crafted from cloth covering people should be wearing it. More so asymptomatic people have a lower chance to spread it to those that are not yet sick. Protecting yourself secondarily.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t go out unless I absolutely have to for essential reasons. There&#039;s 50+ units in my building and even walking the common area and taking out the garbage touching shared doors and levers is some sort of risk, never know who in the building might be sick and coughing in the halls and it&#039;s hanging in the air.<br /><br />Right now is definitely NOT the time to be taking risks and getting sick or getting others sick, it&#039;s just going to increase the already overloaded hospitals, and you probably have no idea where you&#039;re going to end up if you condition deteriorates to the level that you need to leave your home for a hospital, whether makeshift or actual hospital, whether you&#039;ll get a ventilator or not. etc..<br /><br />I would think we need less people going to the hospital right now more than ever, wearing SOME type of face covering if you have to go out hopefully makes some small impact. It should have been happening all along with the rest of the recommendations for hand washing etc.. Especially since we now know 6 feet isn&#039;t enough in most cases. MIT researcher proving it can travel 23-27 feet and hang in the air for hours.

					I was listening to scanner and heard a report of a missing 15 year old.<br /><br />If they have some type of infrared vision assistance I could see the lack of spotlight, but if there&#039;s on the ground officers also canvassing it seems like the spotlight would have been warranted to aide them.<br /><br />It does seem weird that there&#039;s no spotlight in use. Would be nice to hear what Dromm gets from the 115.

Going out without one is simply disrespectful to others if you can help it. No amount of reasoning it away is going to change facts.

Able-bodied people aren&#039;t cut off from any part of the neighborhood, but how often do most people actually walk 10-15 blocks to go to a particular restaurant, grocery store, coffee shop or visit a friend? There&#039;s fine restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores throughout the neighborhood, so you don&#039;t really need to make a daily or multiple-times a week trip 10 blocks away unless you&#039;re very specific in your want/need.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Part of the reality of this is if you&#039;re going to walk 15 blocks to get somewhere, sometimes it&#039;s not that much more of a commitment to just get on the subway and go a few stops further to Astoria or something where there&#039;s a different selection of restaurants etc.. I think that factors into it sometimes.

					I have to admit the number of outages I&#039;ve had in the over 10 years I&#039;ve lived here have been pretty rare. I don&#039;t expect 100% uptime, it&#039;s just not realistic, but in my non-scientific estimation based on experience it&#039;s pretty solid. I&#039;ve seen much worse.<br /><br />We do have FIOS in the building now for around a year I think, I haven&#039;t jumped basically due to NY1. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
