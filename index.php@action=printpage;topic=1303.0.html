				LOL!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;The Jackson Heights Chain Saw Massacre or instead of Jigsaw from the SAW movies Jacksaw.<br /><br />The reason is that Jeff on another post mentioned about buying two new fedoras and when I saw the guy walking across the street I right away thought about him

				Actually it was plaid shorts.&nbsp; I just re-read my post.&nbsp; Plaid shorts are very in now.&nbsp; The shorts were ...I think white, brown and orange.. The brown shirt was long and not tucked into the shorts.&nbsp; The guy actually looked stylish.

				Now plaid shorts are soooooo very different than plaid pants.&nbsp; &nbsp;One is tres chic and the other is tres old man.&nbsp; Eventually Jeff will see this and we&#039;ll know if he&#039;s the mystery man in the fedora and shorts!

				Well Jeff...then someone is imitating you in Jackson Heights!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#039;t see his face since it was hidden under the fedora.&nbsp; I saw him while I was on my terrace.&nbsp; <br /><br />What I do know is that I look at people and see if they match the description that some of you have described about yourselves.&nbsp;

				Now...John Prestor....In one post he described himself as sometimes wearing a smoking jacket and carrying his cane with the gold tip.&nbsp; I&#039;m almost 100% sure I&#039;ve seen him walking on 73rd street.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ok John...do you have extremely dark hair?&nbsp; Almost jet black??<br /><br />As I see more descriptions of folks on the board...I will be looking out for you!!&nbsp; &nbsp; So if you walk on 73rd street between 37th avenue and Broadway...beware...you are being watched!!!!! ;)

				If I saw someone walking down the street in a smoking jacket, gold tipped cane,&nbsp; I&#039;d laugh my ass off.&nbsp; But no way would I think it was JohnPrester.&nbsp; I bet he&#039;s copying Jeff and it was HIM in the fedora and plaid shorts!&nbsp; That JohnPrester knows a fashion trend when he reads it!

				Buddy...since you have your picture on your posts...I have been trying to determine if I see you on the street.&#160; The only thing that you can see is the short dark hair in the avatar, so it&#039;s hard to see what you really look like.&#160; But I will be looking out for you!!!!<br /><br />Oh by the way...since I&#039;m always on the look out for illegal activity on the street, I always have my camera ready next to the terrace door.&#160; It does have a pretty good zoom lens on it so...73rd street passerby&#039;s.... beware!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Well maybe it was your friend that I saw.&nbsp; Still watching out for others.&nbsp; Now that almost all work has been finished on the terraces, I was able to put out all my plants and hanging baskets, so I do spend alot more time on the terrace.&nbsp; So if you walk on 73rd between 37th ave and Broadway, you could&nbsp; be on Candid Camera. ;)

				how come hipsters have to wear what I like to wear? they ruin everything. the fedora blocks out the sun so much better than a regular hat, it&#039;s 360 degrees of shade. <br /><br />and before that the hipsters started to wear the plaid shirts my father wears. I swear, everything my father wears become cool. His wear patterns on his jeans are exactly what abercrombie and fitch fake. even his paint stains are now being copied. <br /><br />eh, who cares? I like it so I wear it. call me whatever you want.

				This past weekend I saw the guy with the fedora again.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure it was the same one I had seen before.&nbsp; I did take a closer look ( I had my glasses on ) at him and he seemed to have reddish hair.&nbsp; Still difficult to distinguish, since I saw him when I was on the terrace.
