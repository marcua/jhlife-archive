				Handsome 5 year old marmalade cat, looking for a little outdoors along with his indoors.&nbsp; Sunny is a rescue cat who we have fostered for the past 4 years. He has adapted to life indoors with two other cats.&nbsp; He has made great strides since his wild youth, learning to purr, enjoy head petting, and napping on a cozy blanket. He loves a cheddar cheese treat, or a bit of butter for being &quot;a good boy,&quot; his favorite saying.&nbsp; He sometimes has a lot of energy, and we feel that he would be better suited to a life where he can explore the outdoors.&nbsp; He might also be happiest as a one-person cat as he has learned to coexist with the other two, but still shows some jealousy.&nbsp; We have wanted to find a more suitable home for Sunny for a while, but now the search has become urgent.&nbsp; We have purchased a co-op apartment with a strict limit of two cats, so we need to find him a home by early July!&nbsp; If you are interested and would like to meet him, or know of anyplace where he might roam (we thought he might make a great barn cat), please email at lhwood63@gmail.com.<br />

				I can only speak to my coop, but I highly doubt anyone would notice, or care, if you had an extra cat.&nbsp; If you feel you need to find him a home for personal reasons, that is your decision.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been in our coop for two years and I don&#039;t think any of our neighbors know the number of cats we have (it&#039;s 2).

				I agree with the previous posterâ€”no way the coop board would find out. Just don&#039;t bring them all in at the same time and if anyone does ask (which they won&#039;t), you could tell them you&#039;re fostering temporarily, which is theoretically the truth anyway.

				Seriously? as if board members themselves don&#039;t break the rules...please.<br /><br />Some do their &quot;duty&quot; just to get an insider track on when cheap apartments are coming up for purchase...please.
