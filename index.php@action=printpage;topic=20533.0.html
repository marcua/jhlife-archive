				That is so painful to watch, but I got to say that lady needs to do more to stop her friend. He was acting crazy.<br /><br />This criminal has anger issue and needs serious, serious help and discipline.&nbsp; Praying speedy recovery to this family, but the traumatic aftermath would be very long-lasting.

				No, I believe it&#039;s the son who thinks he&#039;s a coward for not being able to protect his father, not the public. In any case, how much could he do with a violent person? He did the right thing though to scream for help and get other people&#039;s attention. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=20533.msg103184.html#msg103184">Quote from: sl on May 12, 2021, 06:39:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=20533.msg103172.html#msg103172">Quote from: Garsleat on May 11, 2021, 10:04:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">That is so painful to watch, but I got to say that lady needs to do more to stop her friend.
