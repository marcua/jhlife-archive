				Sure, we can make a stop there if everyone agrees.&nbsp; &nbsp;:angel:<br /><br />I thought we&#039;d stop outside homes that have Xmas lights up, along the route. The route is pretty much a general guideline which can be added to, depending on the weather conditions that night and how far everyone wants to keep going. <br /><br />And if anyone along the way wants to join in, they are more than welcome to do so!

				Saturday, December 17, 2011<br />7:00pm until 10:00pm<br />* * * FREE EVENT * * *<br /><br />Meet near the Dante&#039;s Shopping Center, 31st Ave at 76th St <br /><br /><strong>3rd Annual Jackson Heights Winter Holiday Sing-A-Long</strong><br />An Outdoor Carroling Event -- Snow or Shine !!!<br /><br /><br />Meet on 31st Avenue, between 76th Street and 77th Street, near the bus stop on the Modell&#039;s side of the avenue. (It&#039;s okay to park in the Dante&#039;s lot for this event.)<br /><br />Dress warmly and according to the weather!<br />Wear comfortable / appropriate shoes or boots.<br /><br /><strong>Bring a flashlight or well-protected candle for each person in your group.</strong><br /><br />School Groups welcome and encouraged to join us.<br />All children under age 16 must be accompanied by an adult!<br />If possible, children under age 12 should wear reflective clothing instead of carrying open-flame candles.... for obvious safety reasons.<br /><br />(Service animals welcome; all other pets should remain at home.)<br /><br />We will sing winter and holiday songs from all faiths, languages &amp; cultures as a group, while walking thru the local Jackson Heights area. Please be respectful and courteous to others, even if you don&#039;t know the particular song we&#039;re singing at the moment. We will sing in every and any language the members of the group know, including American Sign Language from students and faculty at the Lexington School. <br /><strong><br />Small, accoustic, portable instruments welcome and encouraged.</strong><br /><br />We will begin by crossing 31st Ave and walking up 76th Street, while singing. The group will then determine the direction and how long we stay out there singing. A good suggestion is to look for houses with holiday lights!<br /><br /><strong><br />Santa Hats encouraged, but not required.<br />Holiday outfits, costumes, or dress-up welcome.</strong><br /><br /><br />SPREAD THE WORD &amp; PLEASE INVITE ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO JOIN US
