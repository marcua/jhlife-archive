					I can not quite grasp the argument in favor of unlicensed street vendors selling food given that mishandled food has the potential to contain bacteria that will make the average person sick.&nbsp; The point of having a license is to protect the public.&nbsp; I am all for protecting the public.&nbsp; Part of the problem might be more a byproduct of ignorance than willful violation of law and maybe we can do a better job at getting vendors to comply with City regulations in this respect.&nbsp;

					Tolls for east side crossings will be a burden on the working class who have to drive in and out of the city.&nbsp; It is essentially a tax on driving disproportionately affecting those who make the least money in our microcosm (NYC).&nbsp; Unfortunately, our government is inherently inefficient (by design) and the people working in agencies have an incentive not only to maintain the status quo in their agency (budget/workforce/statutory authority), but to increase its resources. To illustrate my point, imagine a bureaucrat advocating for the dissolution of his/her agency for the good of the public - can&#039;t do it, me neither.&nbsp; <br /><br />This feature of NYC government (and democracy generally) does not translate to better services for residents and in fact often creates more inefficiency, i.e., generally, the bigger the agency the more inefficient it is.<br /><br />The point is, just because the City decides to increase taxes on those who drive in and out of the City does not mean that the additional revenue will address any of the underlying concerns used to justify the increase in the first place, i.e., maintenance, wages, etc.<br /><br />On the other hand, taxing drivers for traveling in and out of the City in the form of bridge tolls may decrease traffic congestion and make Manhattan a nicer place for residents and workers.&nbsp; <br /><br />No matter how you cut it, NYC sure is an expensive place to live and it is not getting any cheaper. With that said, I would not be surprised if in my lifetime tolls are imposed on East River bridge crossings. When that happens I am sure that there will be corresponding spike in subway ridership.&nbsp;

					I have a plan.&nbsp; Hire private investigators and have them gather the evidence - they cost about $100 an hour.&nbsp; You should really have a lawyer help you determine what evidence will be most effective given the circumstances.&nbsp; Former prosecutors would be the ideal candidates.&nbsp; Depending on the nature of the crimes being committed, i.e., federal versus state laws, bring the evidence collected to the Queens DA&#039;s Office and/or U.S. Attorney&#039;s Office in the Eastern District (EDNY).&nbsp; Of course send a courtesy copy to the local precinct as a courtesy.&nbsp; If nothing has happened within three months, protest at the DA&#039;s and/or U.S. Attorney&#039;s EDNY office after putting out a press release alerting the media of the protest.&nbsp; Send courtesy copies of the press releases to the DA&#039;s and/or U.S. Attorney&#039;s EDNY office and the local precinct.&nbsp; A few consecutive days/weeks of some good old public shaming will get the public servants to act.

					You may want to direct your complaints about the vendors to The City of New York Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).&nbsp; The City Charter describes DCA&#039;s Commissioner&#039;s duties, in part, as follows:<br /><br />The commissioner shall have cognizance and control of the granting, issuing, transferring, renewing, revoking, suspending and cancelling of all licenses and permits, except in the cases with respect to which and to the extent to which any of said powers are conferred on other persons or agency by laws, and shall collect all fees for licenses and permits the collection of which by some other person or agency is not authorized by law. <strong>(d) The commissioner shall enforce all laws relating to the advertising and offering for sale and the sale of all commodities, goods, wares and services; in addition he shall receive and evaluate complaints and initiate his own investigations relating to these matters and take appropriate action, including referral to a federal or state agency.</strong> (e) The commissioner, in the performance of said functions, shall be authorized to hold public and private hearings, administer oaths, take testimony, serve subpoenas, receive evidence, and to receive, administer, pay over and distribute monies collected in and as a result of actions brought for violations of laws relating to deceptive or unconscionable trade practices, or of related laws, and to promulgate, amend and modify rules and regulations necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the department. (<strong>f) The commissioner shall exercise the powers of a commissioner of public markets under the agriculture and markets law with respect to open air markets.</strong> - See more at: <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/NYC/64/2203#sthash.wrPMQhCA.dpuf-" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/NYC/64/2203#sthash.wrPMQhCA.dpuf-</a> <br /><br />I believe that subsection (d) and (f) may be right on point with respect to the Commissioner of DCA&#039;s jurisdiction over fruit vendors.&nbsp; Moreover, under the Rules of the City of New York, DCA is explicitly charged with license enforcement.&nbsp; 6 R.N.Y.C. § § 1-01, et seq.&nbsp; &lt;http://rules.cityofnewyork.us/codified-rules?agency=DCA&gt;.&nbsp; And no matter how you cut it, the DCA has an incentive to issue fines and collect $ on behalf of the City with regards to fruit vendors - unlike any other City agency or politician.&nbsp; <br /><br />Assuming that the vendors you complain about are operating in violation of applicable rules and/or regulations, then you may be able to obtain better results by contacting the Department of Consumer Affairs, via 311 on the internet: <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/311/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www1.nyc.gov/311/</a>.<br /><br />My big gripe about the neighborhood fruit vendors relates to the quality and freshness of the oranges - it&#039;s like playing dice.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; <br />

					I recently moved to a 3 bedroom in JH.&nbsp; We could have moved to any neighborhood in Queens, i.e., very large downpayment, very large household income, spouses both have advanced degrees, and no debt. We chose JH because it is way closer to the City than Forest Hills (five or six extra stops on the local line - sometimes the express goes local) and FH is too close to the Boulevard of Death (we have kids).&nbsp; Bayside is nice, but then you have to buy a car and pay for the long Island Rail Road in addition to the MetroCard.&nbsp; Additionally, JH offers far more dining in terms of ethnic restaurants and you don&#039;t need a car.&nbsp; (Aside: we had to live in Queens because it was close to extended family who play a role in providing childcare.)<br /><br />As compared to Astoria and LIC, JH is far less expensive/reasonable and the historic district&#039;s character makes it a special place.&nbsp; I wanted a 3-bedroom, but did not want to spend over a million dollars.<br /><br />LIC is pretty awesome - nice parks and cool bars - but the 3-bedrooms are ridiculously expensive.&nbsp; Astoria is pretty nice, but the housing stock is disorganized and it only has access to local train lines.&nbsp; Sunnyside is pretty awesome, but the 7 train is unreliable.<br /><br />JH has the best options in terms of housing and transportation and most importantly offers the best bargain - at least for now.<br /><br />JH&#039;s diversity is a big fat plus - it keeps life interesting in terms of people watching and exposure to different culture, i.e., food and entertainment.<br /><br />On that note, I am not surprised the NY Times did an article on my news neighborhood.

					I would be trepidatious about venturing off to Astoria from JH via bicycle.&nbsp; The cars are aggressive and the bike lanes are pretty limited or nonexistent.&nbsp; See, <a href="http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/queens-bike-map/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/queens-bike-map/</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;We should, as a neighborhood, demand a direct, safe, bicycle path to both LIC and Astoria!!!&nbsp;
