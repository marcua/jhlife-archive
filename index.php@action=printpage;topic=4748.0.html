				@Jeff - while I don&#039;t agree with expensive application fees I have to tell You most coops have fees averaging $500 or more.&nbsp; I know one that has a $500 Application fee, a $500 Move In fee and a $250 &quot;Building services fee&quot; - hehehahaheh - None of them are refundable these are actual fees to be paid by renter from an owner.

				I&#039;m with you Jeff what is the benefit of a slightly raised platform space?&nbsp; Does this platform constitute a loft apartment?&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4748.msg31303.html#msg31303">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on June 05, 2010, 10:17:21 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i don&#039;t get what&#039;s the point of a loft if it&#039;s just a raised platform. and 250 for a review? damn. <br />cheap price though. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I don&#039;t know. Back in my studio-apt living days, I might have loved that - I&#039;ve never been one to make the bed, so having a visual barrier would keep the rest of the place looking better. Probably why I also loved my studio in LA in &#039;93 with a murphy bed.

				having been in an apartment with this exact layout -- though not this exact apartment -- i can vouch that the aesthetic is much different (imo, much better) than a standard studio. it definitely does feel loft-like, although i might not have chosen that term on my own, i can certainly see how it applies.
