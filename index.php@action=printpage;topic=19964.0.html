				I haven&#039;t seen this posted here before, but the Walgreens on Northern Blvd is closing next week.&nbsp; Apparently the rent got too high for their sales volume, most likely due to the glut of pharmacies in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Nice staff, they&#039;ll be missed.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you don&#039;t pick up your prescriptions this week, they will probably be transferred to the store on 77th Street in the old Waldbaum&#039;s shopping center, the old Genovese, then RiteAid, now Walgreens.

				Jessica Gonzalez Rojas shared the following petition information recently on Facebook about the Walgreens impending closure. Not sure how quickly they can act to prevent it from closing if the closure is scheduled for next week.<br /><br />The Action Network - Save Our Pharmacy Petition (https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/save-our-pharmacy?source=direct_link&amp;fbclid=IwAR1QQ85o3NwVIuVJegWSSaxKgHhyaqNqnwoS6q-z91F61n_LlyzGFBUy0KI)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/haotmbF.jpg)&nbsp; &nbsp;(https://i.imgur.com/8FU2leG.jpg)<br /><br />

				Too bad. I&#039;m all for supporting mom and pop pharmacies (we go to Frank&#039;s!) but Walgreens isn&#039;t just a pharmacy. I hope they don&#039;t extend the car dealership over there. At least CVS is still there.

				How about we trade the Walgreens for his Mazda dealership and expand Travers Park the entire block?

				This is all very confusing. When a chain like Walgreens wants to come into the community, we bitterly oppose it. And now that they&#039;re leaving, we&#039;re equally aghast. The idea that we are endangered by the departure of this utterly generic outlet (admittedly a useful source of overpriced toothpaste and fattening foods) seems a little far-fetched.

				to be fair, Walgreens didn&#039;t move into the neighborhood. Walgreens bought the locally owned Genovese some years back, and there were people who were upset by that change and made that fact known.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;I have a different question. Was this Walgreens actually ever busy? I wasn&#039;t in there often but when I did shop there it was very quiet and super different from the other big chain pharmacies on Northern. In addition, many smaller pharmacies have opened that people seem very satisfied with as customers along with a number of smaller medical providers.With all of this factored in, I can&#039;t help but wonder if the closing is a business failure for the most part that cannot sustain a rent raise of any sort.

Duane Reade opened on 82nd St. Dollar stores and small pharmacies stock similar merchandise. <br />Online shopping has exploded. <br /><br />What with the huge space of a car park + the store...I would say the business itself can no longer sustain the outgoings.<br /><br />Though I can&#039;t imagine what might replace it.<br /><br />Maybe condos?<br /><br />
