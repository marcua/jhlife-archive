			Hi there <br /><br />I am trying to hunt down some photographs of our neighborhood from the 70&#039;s or early 80&#039;s. I&#039;m looking for shots of shops and storefronts. Does anyone know of a city office that would have pics taken in the 70&#039;s? I know the city did a survey in the 30&#039;s for which pictures are available but anything in the 70&#039;s??<br /><br />thanks!<br />-G<br /><br />30+ year resident of the Heights!<br /><br />PS- If you have any great shots yourself I would love to see them. <br />
