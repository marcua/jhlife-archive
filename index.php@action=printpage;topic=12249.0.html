				Hi neighbors, <br /><br />Do you know anybody who is looking for a missing cat in Jackson Heights?<br />A sweet cat is wondering around my building on 73rd street bet. 35th and 37th Ave since yesterday.&nbsp; She, I think, has grayish hair with white sox.<br />My neighbor told me a nice lady tried to take the cat to her home but it refused.&nbsp; So, the cat is still on the street.<br />If you know somebody who are looking for a missing cat, please let them know.<br />FYI, here is the picture:

				I know that cat. It kept following my wife around and later in the evening we fed it some tuna and it finished the can, then meow&#039;d and we never saw it again.

				Looks like a cat that hangs around the Linden Court garden. We fed it for a couple nights then he disappeared again. Seemed clean and well fed but didn&#039;t want to be friends.

				That&#039;s very nice of you feeding the cat.<br />She seemed hungry so I also fed her last night.<br />I couldn&#039;t find her this morning.&nbsp; <br />It seems she has a pattern: She stays at one particular building for a while and once she got food she moves to another building. Mysterious cat!<br />I hope her owner find her or she find a new home soon.<br /><br />

				I also have interacted with this adorable creature! She seemed quite happy the day I met her a few weeks ago,&nbsp; I looked for her a few times after, but haven&#039;t seen here since. <br /><br />It&#039;s great to hear all the other good samaritans watching out for her welfare !<br /><br />She did not seem like a feral to me, as she was so friendly. But she looked terribly skinny:(<br /><br />

				I think I saw that cat in our garden like a week or two ago. I was inside, though, so didn&#039;t interact with it. I hope it has a home! If anyone manages to catch it, you can probably take it to a vet and see if it&#039;s micro-chipped.

				Saw it again tonight. My wife said no tuna special tonight and it got mad. It started meowing all upset. It goes around begging for food and then disappearing!

				A lady in my building used to make it her business to feed the neighborhood&#039;s feral cats. (Apparently many used to live in the brick house on 34th &amp; 75th St., the one that was replaced by the new middle school.) <br />The lady has since had some health problems and is homebound. This is probably one of her kitties, looking for a new benefactor.

				We heard a cat in some sort of battle in the backyards behind the 74th and 75th st. rowhouses (between 34th and Northern) the other night. I wonder if this was the one!

				that cat looks so very much like Fang, a cat i had from 1984-2001. <br /><br />used to live on the block of 75th between 34th and 35th and there were a lot of feral cats in the alleys. we&#039;d feed sometimes, did trap-neuter-release as well. that battle you heard will probably result in a litter sometime soon, i&#039;d guess.

				Wow, we have a lot of witness!! Thanks all!!<br />Then, my question is how long is the cat around here?<br /><br />When I was looking for a co-op in JH last summer, <br />the site on 75th@34th was already in process of construction.<br />So, is she on the street over a year at least?<br />Is she begging food for that long and spend the freezing NY winter alone?<br />I feel so bad...<br />If my husband had no allergies with cats, she could be mine...<br /><br />I think one of the reason nobody take her home is she looks like a domestic but not feral cat.<br />She has nice hair and is friendly even though she gets a little bit angry when she is hungry.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />I will try catching her next time when I met her and taking her to ASPC.<br />Or maybe we need a help from NYC Feral Cat Initiative before something happen that dssji is ah... implying.<br /><br />BTW, it&#039;s a nice picture, wooden_solider.<br />She is cute but somehow in picture she looks wild!<br /><br />

				Please do NOT take that cat to the aspca. They will put her to &quot;sleep&quot; . If you want to help her perhaps contact a rescue group or a TNR. It is quite possible that this is somebody&#039;s cat that escaped because it seems very friendly toward humans.

(Animal Care and Control is now the official city organization that will take all homeless animals and unfortunately ends up euthanizing so many.)<br /><br />I agree that it is someone&#039;s cat that got out or was &quot;let&quot; out. I saw it on 73rd Street and it was amazingly friendly, sweet and clean. My heart breaks that I&#039;m not in a position to help it at this time but there are definitely rescue groups who might help if someone can get it into their home or basement temporarily.

				Ok Ok, no ASPCA.<br />It seems the best bet is taking her to a vet hoping she has micro-chip.<br />I&#039;m wondering where she is today.<br />

				North Shore Animal League would also be a good option if you can get out there - they&#039;re a no-kill shelter.<br />We found a cat back in November in our courtyard (75th &amp; 37th Ave), a few days later she was in our laundry room. Brought her upstairs, took her to a vet, no microchip, but she had been spayed, was litter box trained, and very friendly with people. We ended up keeping her and she&#039;s a super sweet cat, clearly had a home before she was with us. (We would still like to re-home her, though, because she she doesn&#039;t get along well with our other cats.) It&#039;s awful how people will just abandon their pets. It seems like there is a lot of this happening in JH.
