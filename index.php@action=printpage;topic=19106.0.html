				I took the initiative to separate the Amazon thread from the sex trade topic. I think everyone has an opinion on this. We should all feel free to comment on something that could potentially change the look, feel, value, and reputation of Jackson Heights. (There&#039;s also drug decrim and new NYS AG and QNS DA to add to the mix.)<br /><br />abc wrote: &quot;When I lived overseas near a legal red light district, I had to remove used condoms from the flowerbeds outside, pretty much most mornings. That&#039;s my past experience of living near a legal red light district. Let&#039;s see.&quot;<br /><br />Me: Years ago I would visit Las Vegas on business. I always stayed on the strip and would have a drink-- alone, at the bar. I naively thought it was a good idea, a way to meet people, but quickly learned that I was assumed to be a working girl.<br /><br />I also remember here in JH there were a lot of sex ad cards literally thrown on the sidewalks; you couldn&#039;t avoid them. They were pretty graphic. There was a crackdown and they all but disappeared. I&#039;d hate to see that return to our streets.

				It&#039;s not just going to be legal in Jackson Heights....&nbsp; maybe it&#039;ll move to wall street instead. Maybe there will be less in our neighborhood.

				and the cards might be less ubiquitous. they&#039;d be able to advertise on billboards. most likely, franchises funded by high rollers will own the majority and they could buy space on, say, that new building on 71st. visible from miles around.<br /><br />

				I don’t support the initiative. We should reduce the problem we have, not increase. It’s bad for the neighborhood.

				Tiffany Caban, Melinda Katz, Greg Lasak ... none of them have the power you&#039;re attributing to that office. District Attorneys have no power to make or rescind laws.<br /><br />and, if sex work is decriminalized, you&#039;ll be far LESS likely to be approached on the street. you&#039;ll be able to walk into a place the same way you walk into a restaurant, order what you want and leave.

				oh, i&#039;m not denying she is one of the stronger voices in favor of decriminalizing sex work. she simply can&#039;t unilaterally do it. just like Danny Dromm couldn&#039;t unilaterally declare it legal (or illegal) in the district.

				Legal sex work would allow many immigrants to have extra income to cope with high housing costs. Jackson Heights could have its own red light district like in Amsterdam.

				people seem to assume that Jackson Heights is the only place in the five boroughs where men are looking for sex. the sex trade that exists now is much more profitable in the high-end hotels of midtown, and i&#039;d think that&#039;s where it will flourish -- to say nothing of Williamsburg/Bushwick, Astoria/LIC, Governor&#039;s Island if the hotels get built there.....

				I wouldn’t exactly call the prostitutes in Jackson Heights Heights high end material goods. They are much better suited for the back alleys and behind the bars in Jackson Heights as they are now. Or, In the backseat of cars that I see prevalent when I leave for work at 5 AM.

It&#039;s what I see too. And that&#039;s what I guess will proliferate even more in Jackson Heights if the sex industry is decriminalized.<br /><br />Roosevelt Ave/Jackson Heights certainly doesn&#039;t have the fancy &quot;best little whorehouse&quot; venues that might exist in other NYC neighborhoods.
