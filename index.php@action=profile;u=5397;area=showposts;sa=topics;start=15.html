					Please people, be heard in this important race for our future. YOU COUNT + YOUR VOTE COUNTS!<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s sad that we are seeing so few early voters participate in this years Mayoral election primary<br />even though we&#039;ve been inundated with ad, gigantic postcards and numerous visits. At the same<br />time that voter suppression is taking place in other parts of the US, we are experiencing a kind of<br />voter apathy here. I hope that people find the time tomorrow to get out there and exercise <br />their right to vote! And give suggestions on how we can do this smarter next time.<br />&nbsp;

					&nbsp;This has to be the time in this term for JH electeds to give us what most other Queens communities have- a real Community Center. It has to happen now. What does it look like? What do people want? All ages and abilities, babes and seniors, tweens, teens. Young athletes<br />and new athletes of any age. Computer centers and dancing, a senior center, after school programming. Programs for fathers. And for mothers. Town halls. Voting. All kinds of post school classes. And could we dream about a pool??? We need and deserve this for our community which wants a 365day a year place to exercise and much, much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;Which candidate is going to bring it??? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

					&nbsp;Huge amount of black smoke billowing from a top floor on 75th Street. Really looked intense and was concerned for anyone in there. Many people were on the street to help as that is one of the busiest blocks in Jackson Heights. Hope there were not human casualties <br />but the damage has got to be enormous. About five doors up from Danny Dromm&#039;s office.

					&nbsp;The ballots are open and this is going to be more candidates than the current NYC Mayoral race or the 2020 Presidential election. Everyone is a Parks designer and spokesperson! Who knew that so many were credentialed in this field? OR is it the clown car just trying to fit on as many as possible? Am most interested, so far, in a mash up between the little kids and the seniors solving particular issues of access and safety with traffic. But seriously, the lawsuits will be many and we do need a team of highly skilled urban planners, civil engineers, psychologists among others to see what can be done.<br />&nbsp; Bring &#039;em all in and everyone in the neighborhood can include this one as a new line item on your resume!

					A few miles from Jackson Heights there is an indie theater which is a locally owned and a terrific asset nearby called the Kew Gardens Cinema. The F train stops nearby and it&#039;s about 10 minutes by car. If you are missing in person movies, please visit them soon and know that your support is appreciated. They show films similar to Manhattan&#039;s Angelica theater for a bunch less and they have children&#039;s films and some streaming situation also.There are 5-6 theaters, sweet young people working the concession and tickets and sanitizing all over. Homemade cookies too! Loved &quot;Nomadland&quot; on the giant screen and feel like it was more immersive with the desert landscape that it every would have been at home. Order a great<br />pizza across the street timed for exiting the movie and you have a lovely night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.kewgardenstheatre.com/movies" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.kewgardenstheatre.com/movies</a>

					&nbsp;There are many back channels here in Jackson Heights. Some are fascinating, some are historic and some are god awful. Many kids have learned to ride bikes and skate there. Lot&#039;s of basement entrances are popular. Some have a small piece of paradise right behind their homes. Gardens abound. And some nastiness also. Have you explored them? I believe these are public spaces but am not sure.

Everyone and their brother is trying to claim victory here over making this a done deal. However there are many aspects to consider and the MTA and DOT and NYC Schools and NYC Parks are all going to have to figure out how to manage items like these below - and many more.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Lawsuits from businesses, individuals and various groups like disability access <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Dog CRAP everywhere and gallons of dog pee on the median<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Electric bicycles speeding, regular bicycles speeding<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Delivery trucks all over <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Post pandemic change in use<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;6. Needs of schools for buses<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;7. Business district of 74th street and congestion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;8. Business district of 82nd street and congestion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;9. Business district of Junction Blvd and congestion<br />&nbsp; 10. NYC budget severe losses<br />&nbsp; 11. Should Open Streets be any other street like 37th Ave instead?<br /><br />&nbsp; And a favorite of mine, where is our Jackson Heights Community Center? This is an election year and we are severely lacking in year round recreational facilities along with a fully funded Senior Center, gym, pool and community space. Where is it? And don&#039;t say it&#039;s 34Ave Open Streets because that is just a bandaid for now. Vote!

					&nbsp;Please be careful today - and everyday- walking on 34th Ave. The last few days have been very busy with vehicles on 34th Ave and they may not be aware of the Open Street, especially if they are not local drivers and the barriers are off to the side.<br />

					&nbsp;The public forum by the DOT conducted last month said that they were holding a number of these meetings to determine what the thoughts and issues were on both sides. Was that a SHAM? Over 500 people signed on to that meeting with translators and the many commentators were told it was to gather information over several publicized events. People who had issues with traffic on Junction Blvd. received more compassion than those on 78th street, for example. It felt like just the beginning of a dialogue on many aspects. They sent out another community survey request just yesterday -https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/34thAve<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Or is possible that Danny Dromm is speaking out of turn here? It&#039;s certainly odd that this would not have been publicized in a bigger way, if it were true. How could anyone believe they are truly interested in hearing both sides if a decision has, in fact, already been made? Maybe the &quot;r&quot; in the survey request is for <strong>redundant</strong>?

					&nbsp; After these times are behind us and most people get vaccinated and many return to work, school, social visits, gyms, vacations and what we remember we liked to do, it may be time to shift the street closures to 37th Ave to support our local businesses. Many of them are in dire straits. A number have closed. Their livelihoods are gone or going. Making a few streets into plazas for the some hours of Open Streets would put the street traffic where it&#039;s needed. There are trash cans on the street. Restaurants have bathrooms. There is food to be served and shopping to be done. Early morning exercise programs. Run the avenue. Wheelchair and stroller hours. Teen jobs. Meetups for young people. Drinks! Social times! Helping others. Deliveries can shift to early morning or later in night as in many other areas of the city. We can save our community!! <br /><br />&nbsp;We still desperately need a community social center and every candidate vying for Danny Dromm&#039;s seat should have a plan for this as we are one of a very few communities without a full age/disability center in our neighborhood. So this would be a year round, weather resistant place to exercise, socialize, learn, share and generally be healthier in all kinds of weather, not just the warm, sunny days. <br /><br />&nbsp; We need to rethink the Open Streets program for all of Jackson Heights long term and post pandemic!<br />
