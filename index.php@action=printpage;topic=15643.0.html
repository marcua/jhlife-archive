				The&nbsp; 115th finally did a sweep and removed all the illegal street vendors from 37th Ave. And I have to say, it really makes a huge difference. It&#039;s a complaint driven reason why it was done. So Id like to say, is, if you see something, say something.

				Are you sure it was the police and not the same guys who did it a couple of months ago?&nbsp; It&#039;s usually one of the groups of neighborhood business owners. The 115th have shown they don&#039;t give a crap about the vendors - it&#039;s brought up often at the community meeting and the useless liaison promises to look into it and does absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Rinse and repeat. <br /><br />Regardless, I&#039;m glad. Walking home on 73rd is a pain in the butt. Fruits/veggies on one side, vendors on the other, and a narrow path in the middle with way too many people trying to navigate through it. And it&#039;s unfair to the merchants who pay rent to have illegal vendors doing business right outside their door.

				It was definetly the police, they told me it was because of complaints. I think If they get a couple hundred complaints to 311, you can be pretty sure they will want to rectify it.

				Thanks to everyone who complained. I thought of making a video wearing a camera on my head and just trying to walk down<br />73rd street most days. It&#039;s awful. And the vendors have been careless about the street trees and bike lockups too. I also agree<br />that the merchants who are paying legit taxes for their stores are shortchanged here. Let&#039;s hope it stays this way for awhile.
