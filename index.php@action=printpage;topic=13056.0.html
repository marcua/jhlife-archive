				Hi all - <br /><br />I&#039;m looking for advice from you guys on the current buying process in JH. I&#039;m originally from JH, owned a coop many years ago in the high 70&#039;s on 35th, sold it and took a rental but business took me overseas for about 65% of the last 4 years. I&#039;m back now and I&#039;m looking to buy. My business will still have me overseas (the UK) up to 2 weeks a month but I think at this point in my life (43) I&#039;d like to have a permanent home I can call my own and with my rental lease coming up for renewal, I&#039;m thinking now is the time. I have friends urging me to look in Manhattan, but I&#039;m not looking for (a) a mortgage (based on the prices I&#039;ve seen for JH in NYT, I&#039;m fortunate enough to be able to buy w/o a mortgage), and (b) I&#039;m not looking to spend thousands on monthly CC&#039;s. To me, JH is pretty ideal - easy access to Manhattan via 74th, not too pricey grabbing a cab from the city back home, easy access to the airports, shops, restaurants, etc.. As stated, I am originally from JH so I know the buildings/blocks where I&#039;d like to hang my hat. Ideally, I&#039;d like something in the Hawthorne - 76th being the preferred block, but either block would work. If not, the Chateau, Elm Court and Towers in that order. I am dead set on getting a woodburing fireplace! (have one overseas, cannot imagine a chilly night without one now lol) I don&#039;t mind renos either. <br /><br />I used to know quite a number of realtors in JH - but I see all but one seem to have retired or moved on - otherwise I would have bugged them. So, I&#039;m bugging you good people! Here are my questions:<br /><br />1. Application/Move In/Etc costs - roughly how steep are these now? A friend in a coop in JH told me in his, it is nearly $3000 between application fees, moving in fees, etc.. Sound right? Just trying to get an idea.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Boards - just how strict are we talking here? I know my last coop was getting ridiculous some years back to the point that some buyers walked away -- and the conditions the board there were looking for were such that those board members wouldn&#039;t get in themselves if they were applied to their own applications. To me, it seemed the board was cutting their nose off to spite their face as good, solid and qualified buyers walked away so coops went back up for sale, selling at a lesser price, lowering comps in the building. <br />Anyway, say someone like me, able to pay cash, provide detailed financials from US banks (retirement funds, savings, investment accounts, checking, etc.), business and professional references but who is very leery of providing tax returns and credit check (if you&#039;ve ever been an ex-pat, you know how complicated the tax forms are - even more so when you own the business on both sides of the Atlantic) - what are my chances? <br />Buying overseas, one condition that sealed the deal was putting up 4 years of monthly CC&#039;s in an escrow account. I&#039;d be willing to do the same (4-6 years total) in an escrow account or paid to the coop directly if that would help. <br />Full disclosure - in my last 2 coop experiences in JH, what I would consider confidential/privileged financial information was disclosed by board members to non-board members which became a topic of conversation in the building. It also seemed the more complex one&#039;s taxes are, the more the board seems to think you&#039;re up to no good. I am not looking to have my financial information discussed willy-nilly and knowing how much more complicated my taxes are now, I believe I have a justifiable reluctance to disclose. <br />I would of course provide financial statements from accountants, bankers, brokers, etc. to prove (a) I have the cash to buy, (b) I have the cash to support myself, and (c) if required, I have the cash to provide the escrow account/up front payment. <br /><br />3. I remember some of the smaller coops required everyone to serve on the board - is that really mandatory if one does travel significantly for business? Can one just give your proxy to the board? <br /><br />4. Turn around time - say I am fortunate to find &quot;the place&quot; and make an accepted offer, what has been your experience from accepted offer to board approval/move in? <br /><br />5. In general, would these boards frown on someone like me - travels a lot for business so an empty unit up to 2 weeks month? <br /><br />That&#039;s basically it. I know any renos need board approval - as long as I can replace the tub with a walk in shower, I&#039;m good! Oh! I guess having the option of a washer/dryer in the unit is too much to ask for? (overseas spoiled me lol)<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping you can offer some good advice here - as I&#039;d like to have this all done and dusted in the next few months before I head back overseas. <br /><br />Many thanks in advance for any and all advice, tips, etc. you can offer!

				I can&#039;t really answer any of your questions, but if you&#039;re looking for a real estate agent to contact, you could read some of the threads in the Real Estate and Home Improvement board http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?board=13.0 as there are several realtors who answer questions and post info on this board.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you read the threads and feel they are giving solid advice on this board, chances are they will be able to answer your questions as well when you contact them.

				Glad to hear you still call JH home. It&#039;s a cool neighborhood, getting cooler every year. <br /><br />I think I can offer advice on all your questions. I&#039;ll PM you.

				In my experience, it&#039;s definitely building-by-building. <br /><br />For instance, my building has an extremely easy-going board - it&#039;s hard to get rejected - but a washer-dryer would be an absolute no because of our very old plumbing. (As Scotty said on Star Trek, &quot;she canna handle the load, Cap&#039;n!&quot;) Then again, I&#039;m not in one of the fancy buildings you&#039;re describing with the wood-burning fireplaces.<br /><br />I can&#039;t see a problem with you traveling for business as long as you swear up and down you won&#039;t do anything shady like rent the place out on AirBNB. That is a VERY hot topic in the city right now and an easy way to get boards to turn on flamethrowers. But an empty apartment wouldn&#039;t be an issue.<br /><br />You will have to disclose every financial thing the board is even slightly curious about. No way around that. They need to make sure not only that you have money, but that the money has been acquired through legitimate means!<br /><br />Realtor wise, Daniel Karatzas and Michael Carfagna seem to have a LOT of the listings in the specific buildings you&#039;re looking for. And they&#039;re super experienced, and fixtures in the neighborhood. They can really guide you through. There are other Realtors I&#039;d recommend for other buildings, but for the places you&#039;re suggesting ...

				The complexes you are looking at (except for the Towers, I think) are made up of small individual coops. So the issue of being somewhat of an absentee owner can be a problem, because a small coop needs all hands on deck to help run the building. I live in Hawthorne Court in a self-managed building of 10 apartments, and there really is a lot of work that goes into running the building. When several apartments are owned by people who don&#039;t really live here, it&#039;s hard to divvy up the work in a way that&#039;s fair. It&#039;s not board meetings so much as it is keeping the books, paying vendors, dealing with elevator maintenance issues, building plumbing issues, the laundry machines in the basement, various city agencies who change the rules and issue violations that have to be cleared, etc. <br /><br />We once had a serious water leak on a major holiday (in an absentee owner&#039;s apartment) and someone (me, as it happened) had to stay home and deal with the plumber. Another time one of us had to go to some city agency to deal with a new plumbing requirement. It&#039;s a lot of work, but the upside is we have lower maintenance payments because in addition to having no underlying mortgage, we have no managing agent and no salaried staff (just a live-in part-time super who receives a free apartment in exchange for maintenance work, along with minor compensation.)<br /><br />I just spoke to a neighbor in another HC building who said that they recently turned down an applicant, and one of the reasons was that the person traveled much of the time for work, and they want someone who will be there and be willing to pitch in and help run the place. I know our house feels the same way and when we interview an applicant, we make sure they know that we expect them to help with the shared &quot;chores&quot; of the building. I sometimes think that living in a bigger coop with professional management would be easier.&nbsp; It&#039;s something to keep in mind. But we decided on this because of the lower cost, as well as the charm of the apartments and the convenient location. The downside is, we do have to put in time to help run the place.<br /><br />

				I have to say, I am highly tempted to give you bullet point answers to your questions, but I feel you will likely get conflicting opinions on the same… From what I have read you may not have a “cookie cutter file”, yet possibly a very strong one. Coop deals in my experience value TRANSPARENCY above all things. (and all good business deals for that matter :)<br /><br />My advice is usually to be open about the strengths AND weaknesses of any file. Sometimes determining what is strength or a weakness and in which order to address them may require some evaluation, in added effort to achieve maximum impact. For example your file&#039;s &quot;strengths&quot; are: 1. Strong assets 2. You have owned a coop before, etc.&nbsp; “Weakness”&nbsp; of your file may perhaps be that your income isn’t easy to verify, but if you have sustained comparable housing payments and perhaps even higher for the past 10 years, I don’t see why offering to escrow funds before being asked by the board to do so is necessary. That’s roughly how I would approach it. If the coop package is well structured you’d likely cut some time on processing and board review as well. <br />
