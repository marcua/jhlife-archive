				There are literally pigeon droppings on the turnstiles that have been there for I don&#039;t know how long.&nbsp; The window ledges just beyond the turnstiles are covered with pigeon droppings.&nbsp; Beyond the disgust, could this pose a health hazard?&nbsp; I cannot believe these conditions would be tolerated on the upper east side or anywhere in Manhattan for that matter.&nbsp; Why do they exist here?&nbsp; And.........what can be done about it?<br /><br />

				For what it&#039;s worth, the MTA does have a Customer Feedback form here: https://new.mta.info/customer-feedback<br />

				&nbsp;I am going to complain here too because this station is so dirty! Pigeon crap and layers of grime<br />on so many areas. Nothing feels clean there. Its a huge cultural shock if you take the F Train and<br />get off at the new station on 63rd and transfer uptown. The station is huge and clean and has <br />artwork and wide enough platforms for the commuters. We are getting shafted here in JH.

				I totally agree.....and thanks for the support.&nbsp; The MTA customer feedback form was fairly easy to use, but there were no choices that specifically addressed pigeon droppings.&nbsp; There is a place at the end to write a little something detailing your complaint.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Jackson Heights station has an interesting design and could be so cool if it was clean and kept up nicely.&nbsp;

				You can also reach out to the Group Station Manager - There are signs around the station- about the issues.&nbsp; That was part of Andy Byford&#039;s changes and should garner some sort of response.<br /><br />Anyone have any idea why there is no street-level entrance on Broadway and 74th when you transfer from the 7 to the EFMR?&nbsp; I never understand why, if you are getting off the 7 at the far end of the platform they have you go down two flights, all the way underground to come back up a flight to exit.&nbsp; There is literally a wall where an additional entrance should be.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;This is an excellent question. And one that I think some people solve by using the far <br />ends of the station so as to spend the least time in the maze. I know that Jimmy Van<br />&nbsp;Braemer did some powerwash type cleaning in his district that his funds paid for. <br />Maybe we could get the same done here in JH?<br /><br />And yes, a news station inquiry would be good...
