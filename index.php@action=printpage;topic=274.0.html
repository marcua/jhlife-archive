				There&#039;s been a lot of recent discussion on the neighborhood&#039;s coffee, and it seems that 2007 brought us some new options, in addition to the promise of a soon to open Starbuck&#039;s.&nbsp; Just looking at the polling list shows how lucky we are in Jackson Heights to have so much choice.&nbsp; Below is my take on each place:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Espresso 77:&nbsp; Small and cozy.&nbsp; Awesome coffee, unlike anything we&#039;ve had in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Great for those that enjoy the cafe vibe and like to lounge.&nbsp; Knowledgeable and friendly staff.&nbsp; Eager to please proprietors.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Starbuck&#039;s:&nbsp; Large selection of brews.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t learned enough about all of them yet to comment thoroughly.&nbsp; Kind of the Barnes &amp; Noble of coffee shops.&nbsp; Sit back, relax, read a good book, browse the web, meet a friend, etc.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Dunkin Donuts:&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but feel some loyalty for this place.&nbsp; They&#039;ve kept my coffee cup full for a few years now, especially when all I wanted was just that...a plain ol&#039; cup of drip coffee.&nbsp; The neighborhood senior set seems to enjoy meeting here, and I&#039;ve managed to meet a few interesting folks there.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Seba Seba:&nbsp; Good coffee when you&#039;re in the mood for a cafe con leche accompanied perhaps with an empanada.&nbsp; The vibe can be a bit raucous inside though.&nbsp; In my opinion, a diner serving up Colombian food in addition to coffee.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Lety&#039;s Cafe &amp; Bakery:&nbsp; Nice pastries, delicately prepared by Mr. Herrera, formerly of Veniero&#039;s.&nbsp; Again, nothing like this in the neighborhood...and no, Carollo doesn&#039;t compare.&nbsp; Friendly, family owned and run business.&nbsp; I have no issues with making myself comfortable here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that despite the recent opening of Espresso 77, loyal Lety&#039;s customers keep going back for the Italian pastries.&nbsp; The coffee being served is good, and is traditional drip.&nbsp; Espresso also available, but to be honest, I sneak around the corner for that!&nbsp; No WiFi here, but Lety and Octavio do make you feel welcomed.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Cannelle Patisserie:&nbsp; My version of in and out coffee coupled with an awesome flakey and buttery croissant!&nbsp; Muffins and assorted pastries done to perfection.&nbsp; They seem to now be experimenting with quiche, but I&#039;ve yet to try it.&nbsp; Coffee is a bit on the weak side, and could use some improvement.&nbsp; The place is pretty huge and they still have room for more tables!&nbsp; Good place to take the kids.&nbsp; No WiFi here.&nbsp; Due to its size, it&#039;s can get a bit loud in there anyway, so you really wouldn&#039;t want to try to sit and concentrate on something other than enjoying the amazing pastries.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>McDonald&#039;s:&nbsp; You pretty much know the deal.&nbsp; I have heard some positive comments on the new coffee they&#039;re serving.</li><li></li></ul><br />What coffee will you be drinking in 2008?

				It looks like our area will be getting yet another great coffee shop.<br /><br />Jen at the JHFamilies listserv noticed that Esparks Coffee (http://esparkscoffee.com) (currently in Astoria) is opening a second location at&nbsp; 80-01 Broadway (at Baxter).&nbsp; The hospital and playground are right there, so this is an ideal location for something like this.&nbsp; It should do well.<br /><br />

				Although I voted &quot;All of the Above&quot; on this coffee poll, in my non-expert opinion, nothing beats a homemade version of cafe cubano.&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d share this simple recipe I found on the internet.&nbsp; This happens to be the method I was taught to make cafe cubano, and its aroma and flavor are awesome!&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.ineedcoffee.com/99/08/cubano/

				I happen to love Starbucks coffee.&nbsp; When my husband I moved to the neighborhood I emailed Starbucks and asked if they would think about opening a store.&nbsp; We&#039;re still waiting.&nbsp; At least now, we have FreshDirect, at first they would not deliever to Jackson Heights, you could order on line and then have to go to Long Island City to pick it up.

				Thanks, toddg and Chuckster for the update on Espresso 77 since the opening of Starbucks.<br /><br />I have nothing against Starbucks, but I&#039;d far prefer to see a locally owned business succeed in the neighborhood if it is a choice between the two.&nbsp; I don&#039;t drink coffee, so I don&#039;t make it into Espresso 77 very often, but I make all my out of town guests go there for coffee.<br /><br />I recently saw an article (WSJ?&nbsp; Business Week?) that said that, counter what you might imagine, Starbucks usually leads to increased business at nearby local shops.&nbsp; I sure hope that&#039;s the case here and that they can both thrive!<br /><br />

				Interesting there&#039;s no comparisons between lety&#039;s (a local business), and Starbucks. Maybe it&#039;s because espresso 77 is more similar to Starbucks than Lety&#039;s (which is a bakery first and foremost). However, I recall the Daily News article where she spoke about feeling the coffee sales would decline--at least for awhile, however, knew she had the pasteries hands down. Her competition would really be Cannelle and that&#039;s so far, that it might as well be in Sunnyside. However, there are some nice things happening in JH food wise, so they can all co-exist. I think the article that you read was posted on this forum months back. I mean look at all the Thai places in Elmhurst, almost a dime a dozen. It&#039;s always Nusara vs. Chao or Sri (i refuse to spell it out) vs. Zabb. I think that variety truly is the way to go, it combats boredom.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing a lot of Starbucks lately because it&#039;s new to this area. Lety&#039;s was my main place, so, i&#039;ll probably start going again, and it will be like a new place all over again. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a coffee aficionada, but I have to admit that I&#039;ve been hitting up all the coffee places in the neighborhood.<br /><br />For best taste, I prefer Espresso 77.&nbsp; Starbucks offers a comfortable environment to lounge around while enjoying my coffee.&nbsp; Come to think of it, I&#039;m just starting to learn what this whole &quot;Starbucks&quot; experience is all about.&nbsp; When I go to Lety&#039;s, it&#039;s mostly for pastries...which I have to admit that I&#039;ve been indulging in much too frequently.&nbsp; I love their anisette cookies.&nbsp; On Cannelle -- The coffee is just O.K., but O.K. is good enough when the real reason I&#039;m heading over there is for the decadent French pastries and croissants.&nbsp; I even do Dunkin when I&#039;m just in the mood for a good cup of coffee accompanied by a donut or two.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; Cafe con leche options are definitely abundant in the neighborhood...pair it up with some tostones, a chicharron de guayaba or an empanada, and I&#039;m in heaven!<br />

				I definitely like the Starbucks experience. I also like some of their food options. Nice, fresh salads and sandwiches that are tasty and low-calorie (when they&#039;re not ravaged). Actually a place to get a salad that doesn&#039;t use iceburg. I haven&#039;t been to Cannelle in ages, probably when the whether is better it will be a real lure.

I am frankly a bit surprised that he would be quoted as saying â€œThe community should not have to settle for less because it deserves the best.&quot; What is he suggesting? That our locally grown coffee shops are not the best? In my mind, Starbucks is fine and gives a good balance to the retail on 37th, but we should note that chains send their profits to corporate headquarters while the profit from locally owned stores stays in the community with owners who live and work here. It&#039;s called the multiplier effect. For every dollar you spend at Starbuck&#039;s, the majority of the profit gets sent away. But compare that to every dollar you spend at Letty&#039;s or Expresso 77. Those profits get respent by the owner who lives in the community, shops at local stores and eats at local restaurants. That money in turn gets spent by employees and owners of that establishment, and so on. So every dollar spent in a local store is &#039;multiplied&#039; many times over every dollar spent in a national chain. I wish our politicians would work as hard to help local stores as they did to get Starbucks in the &#039;hood. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I am not against Starbucks being here - I just want folks to be educated about how their buying decisions affect the neighborhood. <br /><br /><br />

Queens? New York State? New York/New Jersey Metropolitan area?<br /><br />If I were a young teenager today looking for part time employment - after school, summertime, etc., I would choose Starbuck&#039;s over any other crummy job working for some &quot;salt of the earth&quot; locally owned business, and I&#039;m sure you would also.&nbsp; Which place would pay me more?&nbsp; Starbuck&#039;s, the corner &quot;bodega&quot;, or an &quot;ethnic&quot; restaurant?&nbsp; Which place has the better health care plan?&nbsp; Which place has the better stock option/employee stock purchase plan?&nbsp; Also, the employees of Starbuck&#039;s will have even more money to spend locally, due to higher relative wages, compared to what the &quot;locally owned&quot; business owner would most likely pay. <br /><br />Lastly, many of the &quot;locally owned&quot; business are typically looking to pay <em><strong>the lowest possible wages</strong></em> they can.&nbsp; Yes, that is obvious &quot;code speak&quot; for another topic!&nbsp; Starbuck&#039;s can&#039;t play that game as easily as the &quot;locally owned&quot; businesses can!&nbsp; As for Starbuck&#039;s &quot;stealing from the employee tip jar&quot;, I&#039;m aware of that issue, and that&#039;s also another topic!
