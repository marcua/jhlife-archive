				This is some information I have seen in the jhfamilies email list. It sounds very interesting. <br /><br />By Clare Trapasso / NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br />Thursday, April 11, 2013, 6:00 AM<br /><br />Jackson Heights leaders are trying to turn an abandoned 17th-century cemetery, dotted with garbage instead of grave stones, into a small park.<br /><br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) said he plans to organize a community cleanup of the Leverich Cemetery this spring. It is unclear if anyone is responsible for the overgrown cemetery as city records don’t list an owner of the small plot.<br /><br />“We have to take matters into our own hands and just clean this area up,” Dromm said, noting that a washing machine, half a motorcycle and feral cats now inhabit the land. “It’s become a dumping ground and nobody wants to take responsibility for it.”<br /><br />About a decade ago, a locked fence was installed around the cemetery, which sits behind some buildings near Leverich St. and 35th Ave. But the fence has long since fallen into disarray and the lock is broken, said local activist Martin Maier.<br /><br />“It should be converted into something useful — maybe a park or a memorial,” said Maier, who is leading the charge to clean it up.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/jackson-heights-locals-turn-abandoned-17th-century-cemetery-park-article-1.1312903#ixzz2QFZclZEr<br />

				There are several problems that surround the Leverich Family Burial Ground. The ownership of the original homestead and farm was passed amongst family members as inheritance or at times through sale. Early on the Burial Ground was separated from the farm parcel. Therefore it would seem that Burial Ground was intended for the use of all Leverich&#039;s without distiction as to which Leverich owned the farm.<br /><br />The original access to the Burial Ground was on the Trains Meadow Road just east of the homestead which also sat on the Trains Meadow Road. When the farm was sold by the last Leverich owners and the new Jackson Heights street grid was being drawn up, the Trains Meadow Road was abandoned. The last vestige of it that has survived is 35th Road which was the site of the homestead. The disappearance of the homestead by fire was considered at the time suspicious and likely arson.You can see today on 75th Street between 35th and 34th Avenues the 1950&#039;s construction on both sides of the street that was the site of the original road. The small apartment house on the west side of the street is an odd shaped lot reflecting the route of the road which ran there. <br /><br />As the new street grid was being laid out,&nbsp; 71st Street could not continue south of 35th Avenue because it would run over the Burial Ground. At the junction of the old Trains Meadow Road and Leverich Street 71st Street was picked up again, bypassing the Burial Ground, and continuing south to 37th Avenue. <br /><br />With the new parcels on the new streets the Burial Ground was left land locked by private property. There is no official public access to the Burial Ground today. It can only be reached by trespassing private property.<br /><br />It is said that no one owns the Burial Ground. In theory it would seem to belong to all the descendants of the Leverich family which are numerous at this point, Tom Leverich being the most visible. Even if the city could take possession of the property it still remains with no public access. I would like to think that there was some stipulation in the landlocking of the Burial Ground that a right of easement was provided for the Leverich family, but the place just seemed to fall into no man&#039;s land and abandoned by all.<br /><br />For any of the homeowners whose property abuts the Burial Ground the problem has always been vandalism and garbage dumping. The next inhabitants of the Burial Ground would naturally be rats if it had not become a feral cat sanctuary. <br /><br />In summary, there is no logical way for that space to become a public garden. Perhaps it can be cleaned up privately again as it has been numerous times over the years. Maybe underneath things some headstones might be found and restored. But the problem still remains as to who will be responsible for maintaining things. And without public access I doubt the surrounding homeowners will appreciate having trespassers and noise in their back yards.&nbsp; <br /><br />So while Jackson Heights has grown up all around them, the Leverich&#039;s that sleep there do so assured of their peace with the cats as their guardians.

				You are very knowledgeable on this topic.<br /><br />For the ownership problem, the natural solution is for the city to take over the place as as no one in the descendants of the Leverich family has taken the responsibility for many years to maintain the place and no one in the Leverich family has been able to claim ownership himself due to&nbsp; the potential conflict of interest of many other&nbsp; descendants of the Leverich family. <br /><br />The public access is not a huge problem. First the city also needs to clean up the area of the long arrow alley at 71st st and 35th ave that leads to the burial area. The next thing is probably to wait for many years until a single family house on the Leverich ave is up for sale. The city can bid up and buy the single family. Then the combination of the single family house and the burial place will have a much better public access to the Leverich ave.&nbsp; This works the same way as the city currently bought the garden&#039;s school yard, with the extension of the 78th play street,&nbsp; resulting in&nbsp; much more play space for the community. Jackson Heights definitely needs more community space for parks. <br /><br />

				The alley way that you refer to is private property. It is a driveway for the rented parking spaces in the back and a rear entry for the storefronts on the avenue. Unless things there get really out of control the city has little or nothing to say.<br /><br />Your plan for buying a house on Leverich Street might work. It also might not occur in our lifetime unless the city or community is willing to entice a homeowner to leave with extra large sums of money. <br /><br />Then there is the issue of what to do with the place. Would creating a playground over a historical graveyard be appropriate? The Pauper&#039;s Burial Ground in Flushing, aka Martin&#039;s Field, and renamed in 2009 as The Olde Towne of Flushing Burial Ground, is nearly an exact example of the same. The playground that was built years ago was removed and a public memorial green is now in place. There was little to nothing left of the original cemetery, the place having been bulldozed when the playground was created. But it is likely that some burials have remained. A playground there was totally inappropriate as it would be here.<br /><br />I&#039;m also sure that there would be opposition from the neighbors who abut the Leverich Burial Ground. They would not want a public space behind their yards for reasons of pedestrian traffic, noise and security. It also seems that several land owners there have extended their yards encroaching onto the burial ground. Tom Leverich indicate years ago that he would encourage an archeological dig of the place if the intention was to restore the graveyard or create a memorial garden. That also would be time consuming and expensive with who paying for it?<br /><br />I think everyone concerned, for their own reasons, would like to see something done there. The main problems being getting everyone to agree on what is done, who is paying for it, and how the place will be used. Until then, the cats rule.<br /><br />

				<em>The following message is from Tom Leverich, which I am posting on his behalf:</em><br /><br />For more information about the history of the Leverich Burial Ground, visit http://longislandgenealogy.com/LeverichBurial.pdf<br /><br />The burial ground should be cleaned up and maintained.&nbsp; There are likely grave markers buried on the site.&nbsp; An Archeological survey and DNA testing of remains would be ideal, with the site ultimately becoming a small park.&nbsp; This requires financial resources and the resolution of legal issues pertaining to ownership of the property (it appears to own itself). The New York City Landmarks Commission and the Queens Historical Society may be supportive.&nbsp; &nbsp;Re Public Access, a zoning map of the location appears to indicate a public easement on the driveway.<br /><br />For more information on Rev. William Leverich, visit<br />http://longislandgenealogy.com/REVWIL.PDF<br /><br />About the Leverich Family, visit www.leverichgenealogy.org.<br /><br />Ultimately, a small quiet memorial&nbsp; park&nbsp; would be most appropriate, and likely could find support among the&nbsp; neighbors bordering the property.&nbsp; A playground would likely be too active a use, and less likely to find support among the neighbors.<br /><br /><br />Tom Leverich, West Windsor, NJ <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thanks&nbsp; Beech Court for the insightful discussion.<br /><br />If &quot; a small quiet memorial&nbsp; park&nbsp; would be most appropriate, and likely could find support among the&nbsp; neighbors bordering the property&quot;, the public access is still required. If the alley is owned by the stores on the 35th ave and rented parking places, the city&#039;s only choice is to buy a house on Leverich Ave.<br /><br />I was looking at the &quot;http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history&quot; you mentioned. According to the cityparks description (http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/Q017/history), the city spent $2.67 million on the improvements. I&#039;m sure if a powerful local politician can get this amount of money, it will be enough to entice a neighbor to sell his house and there is still money left to work on the improvements on the memorial park. <br /><br />By the way, the city spent $6 million buying the yard of garden school ($4 million was allocated by&nbsp; Daniel Dromm) so that the local community can use the yard outside the school hours. From the first post of this thread, Daniel Dromm is on top of this. Let&#039;s hope that he can get the resources and find a creative solution of the public access problem.<br />

				This is really, really interesting! Those considering the realization of the space should visit another unusual micro-park space in the city: Septuagesimo Uno, a teeny .04 acre lot of land that&#039;s technically a slightly larger than usual alleyway between two brownstones on the Upper West Side.&nbsp; The city acquired the property under Mayor Lindsay in the 60&#039;s after it was marked for condemnation.<br /><br />The park is overall a lovely, tranquil place to sit with a few drawbacks.&nbsp; One, neighbors (who are already notoriously horrible in the area at picking up after their dogs in the area) used it as a dog run for a while (and still do, although more surreptitiously) and the other, given the narrowness and &#039;secret garden&#039; feel of the space, the back of the park is occasionally occupied by a homeless napper or amorous/high teenagers.&nbsp; Just some things to consider when thinking about the potential mis-use of space, although overall I think most people are really glad it&#039;s there. <br /><br />(http://untappedcities.com/newyork/files/2013/04/IMG_2057-small-640x350.jpg)

				JHBG is sponsoring a Leverich Cemetery Cleanup Day on May 25, 2013.&nbsp; Read about it on their website<br />http://www.jhbg.org/2013/05/10/leverich-cemetery-clean-up-may-25-2013<br /><br />(http://www.jhbg.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-shot-2013-05-10-at-1.07.51-PM-633x290.png)<br /><br /><strong>from JHBG website</strong><br />Saturday May 25,<br />10 – 2 PM<br />Meet us behind Legends Bar on 35th Avenue. Look for blue balloons!<br /><br />We will be cleaning an abandoned Jackson Heights cemetery to turn it into a green space.<br /><br />Hidden away from the public, Leverich Cemetery in Jackson Heights was once part of a family-owned farm land passed down through generations. But at one point the farm was bequeathed with the cemetery plot no longer included.<br /><br />The 17th century cemetery presently has no owner. It remains on 35th Avenue near Leverich Street. Through the years, homes and stores have sprung up around the site, which today bears no grave markings.<br /><br />According to Jackson Heights historian Daniel Karatzas, most residents have no idea the cemetery exists and it has become a dumping ground with no one looking after it.

				&nbsp;There are still lot&#039;s of factors involved in the Leverich cemetery space. Being open to the public is a great<br />goal but it may be a long way off till all the legalities of having an open public space in this day and age will be solved. As you probably know we live in a very litigious society and all the details must be attended to properly. Showing support for the work through Danny Dromm&#039;s office may be one good way to help the <br />cause. Any other politicians too for that matter.
