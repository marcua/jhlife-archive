				&nbsp; Am not able to find information on the locations of which of the 900+ stores that CVS plans to close soon. Does anyone else know how to find this? Or have any other info? The JH store feels kind of bare on the shelves but that could be due to the supply chain issues maybe. It&#039;s always felt like a pretty busy store but it does take up the whole block and has that parking lot so it might be attractive for other businesses if the rent is high and the lease is up. The other CVS up in the 90&#039;s is a very busy store too.

				they are closing 900 over the next three years, 300 of them in 2022. they haven&#039;t announced any details yet, but they could very well shut one or the other. To corner office types in Woonsocket, Rhode Island - their corporate HQ -- 20 blocks separation seems like they&#039;re right next door to each other. i seldom go into the big-box drug stores, since i have two mom and pops i like, but i hate losing a retailer i like and am comfortable with, so i feel for their customers.
