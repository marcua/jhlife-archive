				I think I live in this coop. It is a large coop - 4 buildings with 465 apartments. Reasonably priced apartments. The maint. includes gas and electric. On site parking, laundry rooms, enclosed - locking playground.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Oh yes, pets are allowed. :D<br /><br />If you are interested, a great agent is Marge Kaufman (she also lives there). She is in the phone book.<br /><br />Good luck!!!

				I know of a nice 2 bedroom, asking price $250,000.&nbsp; it&#039;s on 34Th Ave. bet. 87/89 Street.&nbsp; There is a cement playground.&nbsp; Part of a 4 building complex.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know anything about terraces though so I&#039;m thinking this is another apartment.

				Don&#039;t know for sure but the buildings with terraces and a cement playground have the tiniest kitchens I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; If they&#039;re the buildings I&#039;m thinking of, I looked at an apartment years ago.&nbsp; The Terrace, for me, didn&#039;t make up for the actual apartment layout.&nbsp; Again, I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m talking about the same buildings. There are several buildings here with terraces.

				There are some sacrifices even I would make for a 22 foot terrace. All my life all I ever wanted to do was sit outdoors with a cup of coffee at 6:30 every morningâ€”summer, fall, winter, springâ€”doesn&#039;t matter. There&#039;s always a sweater to wear! Now, more than any other time in my life, I would love to have a terrace. I would probably nap outdoors.

				I&#039;d be ecstatically happy with enough room for 1 chair and a snack table! I could take a pillow, put it on the snack table, sit down on the chair, put my arms around the pillow and rest my head. ZZZzzz!

				Oh! How I wish the OP would come back and answer some of our questions!<br /><br />eddiestjohns, do you know if the Roosevelt Terrace Coop allow pets? I am starting to think a lot about having a terrace, and how much I have always wanted one. I&#039;ve never even thought about owning a house, but I am even having dreams about a balcony or terrace. BTW, what is the difference between a terrace and a balcony?

				I live in Roosevelt Terrace. <strong>Yes, pets are allowed</strong>!<br /><br />The apartments with 22 foot terrace is generally a 1 bedroom. The rooms are large and airy - cross ventilation in each room. Gas and electric included in maintenance (small monthly flat rates however). The ceilings/floors are poured concrete and really silent. These are fireproof buildings - no fire escapes. Two elevators in each building. Laundry room in each building. There are 3 underground parking lots and 2 above ground lots. A large, gated/locked play ground (renovation awaiting landmark approval). <br /><br />The terrace is great. It is a pleasure to sit outside and enjoy the weather. We have an enclosed terrace which allow us to be outside year round without weather worries. (Screens in the warm weather and glass in the cold).<br /><br />I have lived here a long time and really enjoy it.<br /><br />
