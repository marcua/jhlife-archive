				My kitchen doorway has hinges on them and I&#039;ve noticed the same on other doors in kitchens in the area. So.... did kitchens use to have doors on them??

				Mine, too. Honestly, I wish we still had the door. <br /><br />Pre-war/1950s American kitchens were still primarily utility-oriented and not thought of as social spaces or spaces you would want anyone outside of your family to see. The social aspect really took off as more and more kitchens, alongside living rooms, were featured on television shows in the 50s and 60s. Open concept kitchens really took off from that point becoming the norm by the 90s.

When I renovated, I switched one of them out for a French door. <br /><br />I&#039;m pasting a link to my thread from several years ago, but the contractor I mentioned has moved to Florida. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=12226.0<br /><br />When I was thinking about renovating, a few people suggested eliminating the doors and turning those openings into arched entryways, but I&#039;m glad I stuck with the doors.

				Our 1921 kitchen had two doors when we moved in. We removed the swinging door between the kitchen and dining room because it was in the way and taking up space--and we had no need to open and close the door every time we walked into and out of the kitchen. Or really ever--we saw no need to close that door for any reason. It was a nice, heavy, dark wood door and we gave it away to someone who wanted a swinging door. We kept the other door that leads to the hallway, bedroom, and bathroom because that helps insulate the bedroom from sounds in the kitchen, so we do close that door to facilitate sleeping and napping.
