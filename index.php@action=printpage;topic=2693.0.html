				I found this NY Times article pretty interesting.<br />&nbsp;Snark Attack &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/realestate/03cov.html).<br /><br />It&#039;s about online discussions, mostly of new condo development, which contain attacks (negative opinions) by viewers.&nbsp; I looked at the forum they mentioned in the article, Streeteasy, and &nbsp;found a discussion about Jackson Heights &nbsp;(http://www.streeteasy.com/nyc/talk/discussion/4216-jackson-heights) that really was mostly not very snarky at all, but still not necessarily the place I would choose to get my information. <br /><br /><em>here&#039;s an excerpt from the Times article</em><br />Alison Rogers, an agent with DG Neary Realty and a real estate blogger, posts on StreetEasy, where her balanced-for-a-broker remarks have earned her an unusual degree of respect from a set that is blatantly anti-broker. She noted that anger, defensiveness and denial will almost certainly set off a feeding frenzy, as will a post that seems to be written by the owner or broker without the appropriate disclosure. <br /><br />She favors correcting factual errors and countering negative opinions â€” but only to a point.<br /><br />â€œYou donâ€™t want to draw conclusions for people,â€ Ms. Rogers said. â€œYou want to present your case and let them draw their conclusion. Like, â€˜I know thereâ€™s not much of a view, but it has a fabulous bathroom.â€™ Or, â€˜You might not think the light is as good as I do, but I said it faced south and it does.â€™ However, you canâ€™t do that seven times â€” you have to pick your battles.â€<br /><br />One of Ms. Rogersâ€™s listings â€” a one-bedroom prewar co-op at 731 Greenwich Street in the West Village listed for $517,000 â€” came under attack on a StreetEasy thread by an open-house visitor posting under the handle nycjunior1. <br /><br />â€œThey said, â€˜Itâ€™s got no light â€” itâ€™s a dungeon and you couldnâ€™t pay me to live there,â€™ â€ Ms. Rogers recalled. â€œAnd I came back and pointed out the wood-burning fireplace and the lovely common gardens.â€<br /><br />The critic responded with an even harsher review that ended by demanding that Ms. Rogers drop the asking price by $250,000. She chose not to respond. <br /><br />Some brokerages forbid their agents to intervene except in extreme cases.<br /><br />â€œWe basically do not allow our agents to post comments without prior approval, because we think itâ€™s a can of worms,â€ said Diane Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. â€œUnless something is egregiously incorrect, itâ€™s almost better to let it die, because if you comment on it, it takes on a life of its own.â€<br />
