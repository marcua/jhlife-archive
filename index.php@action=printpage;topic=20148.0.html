				Terrible survey, cumbersome and repetitive.&nbsp; You may win the card just because I can&#039;t imagine very many people will complete it.

				Agreed on most complaints against this survey, certainly on the repetitive aspect! Sorry to say, I left the survey after it was apparent the same set of questions was going to be asked for each subway line I&#039;d mentioned, which would have taken me wAAAy longer than fifteen minutes. <br /><br />Maybe they just really don&#039;t want to give away those MTA passes? I&#039;d just like to see some real preventive pandemic improvements. :-\

				I just took the survey. You can just do the line you took most frequent and then skip the rest of the line or buses. I did one subway line and one bus.<br /><br />Is not that slow, at least when I did it on my laptop, it take a few minutes to load afterward is not too bad. The questions are long and some are repetitive, I guess they try to see if you are consistent with your answer. Hope it will give them some feedback.<br /><br />Only thing I am surprise is how MTA got a hold of my email, as I never use or signup any MTA services or newsletter.

MTA&#039;s either going through the trouble of being selective, or more likely a third party has access to your email address ::)
