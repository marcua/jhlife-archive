					Of course the moderator did not mean to imply that my husband was condoning violence. Let me help here. First, my husband had mentioned that he felt that the arrests were unjust and equated them with Giuliani&#039;s efforts to clean up Times Square. The moderator took that to mean that my husband believed that the sex workers were arrested in the Peralta-supported sting and was accusing Peralta of attacking sex workers. As such, the moderator banned my husband under troll rules for spreading misinformation about Peralta. In fact, he never said that nor made any comment that was factually inaccurate about Peralta.<br /><br />Similarly, the moderator mentioned that senators do not support violence, and that could be taken to mean that he is accusing my husband of condoning violence. It is ironic that my husband was banned for accusing Peralta based on a misinterpretation of his words, and then the moderator, in turn, made an equally vague statement that could just as easily be interpreted as breaking forum rules. <br /><br />I hope spelling out what most people would understand as irony is not going to get me banned.<br /><br />Thank you for blessing my heart, which, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, is not meant to be a sardonic comment directed at what you view as a terribly misguided woman supporting her stupid, liberal husband who wishes to protect one of the last remains of New York--Roosevelt Avenue.<br /><br />There are valid differences of opinion on this. We moved into this neighborhood as we repeatedly fled previous efforts at gentrification--first the East Village, then the Lower East Side, then Chinatown. Now our beloved Jackson Heights is turning a drab, gentrified gray as well. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, we have profited handsomely from this process, and have indirectly contributed to it just by purchasing real estate. We have become 1%ers thanks to our first $30,000 purchase of real estate in Manhattan decades ago, which led us to perpetually flee to lower income neighborhoods that in turn were gentrified. Now, we are millionaires. Is that money is worth the humanity that our city has lost? <br /><br />Finally, just as a point of education, the vast majority of you have purchased services from people who were trafficked by coyotes and snakeheads. About 99% of human trafficking is *believed* by sociologists to involve restaurant industry and other industries with informal workers (e.g., home help). The vast majority of sex workers studied by sociologists are working in the industry because they have to in order to support themselves or their families. It is ugly, often. But to characterize all sex workers as trafficked is probably wrong. All of us (myself included) should do our research before posting! <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking</a>

					@dssjh<br /><br />We love Ben, too. Please do not be afraid of those with keyboard courage on this forum. It seems that those with progressive views are often blocked, censored, or words are misconstrued by others and by moderators while conservatives with keyboard courage have free reign. <br /><br />Hoping Ben is back in our community soon!!

					Thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt. pm124 is my husband. This is my first time on this forum. I wrote because I feel like your actions were unfair.<br /><br />pm124 said...&quot;[Peralta] wants to arrest our immigrant neighbors, our trans community, to harass lesbians and gays on the street.&quot;<br /><br />Maybe that is going too far because it implies that these are his specific policies rather than an indirect consequence of them. But the article Sen Peralta put *in his own email* lists 8 Latino males who were arrested. Guiliani&#039;s efforts in Times Square involved targeting exactly the same population in question, even if he did not say so. Sure, Peralta did not specifically state that he targets these groups, but his proposed and actual policies do so. I loved Bloomberg, but he also targeted these groups with Stop and Frisk, even if he did not specifically state that he did. And that raid probably scared those poor women to death.<br /><br />The moderator said, &quot;and fundamentally, these accusations are ridiculous.&nbsp; Every elected official in the area favors cleaning up violence...&quot;<br /><br />Sure you can ban anyone you want on a forum. The point is, that, according to the forum rules, doesn&#039;t that make you in violation as well? Didn&#039;t you just accuse my husband of condoning violence? You should ban yourself for 7 days!!

					pm124 told me that he was blocked from Jackson Heights life for the above post. While the content might be controversial in some way, I believe his post is largely factual, though there is room for interpretation. The 8 men arrested all have Latino names. Their immigration status (thank God) was not stated, but our community is an immigrant community. In my understanding of US law, all 8 will be labeled sex offenders and might have a difficult time getting jobs, but I could be wrong. They were probably lonely, sad guys just looking for human touch. <br /><br />Sex work is sad. Johns are sad. Busting sad guys doesn&#039;t seem like it is going to solve any human rights problems anytime soon, just create more. (Unless you believe that the war on drugs or making prostitution illegal has helped in this regard. I don&#039;t believe that there is any evidence that it has.)<br /><br />If this post breaks the rules that allow for censorship, then I believe that the moderator who accused pm124 also broke the rules (much more clearly) by indicating that pm124&#039;s content condoned violence (it clearly did not). <br /><br /><br /><br />What does the community have to say about this? (Before I&#039;m banned, too, for knowing him, supporting him, or posting this!!)<br /><br /><br /><strong>[Moderator&#039;s note: pm124 was suspended for 7 days for making outrageous and public accusations about the motives of another individual, which violated the board&#039;s rules against trolling.&nbsp; We&#039;ll give GCM the benefit of the doubt that he/she is not the same person as pm124, but we do note that the account was opened immediately before this post was made, using the same computer that pm124 uses.]</strong>
