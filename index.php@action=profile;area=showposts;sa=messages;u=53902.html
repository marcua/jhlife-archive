Indeed, in your world, the public owner of the building in the London fire has no responsibility whatever for the death of what is known to be 79 people and likely to be over 100.<br /><br />Here&#039;s another view. Maybe Fillmore Hall and the rest of the buildings in historic Jackson Heights should get a grip on the fire hazard and deal with it proactively, instead of dumping the issue on individual apartment owners and effectively telling them to fend for themselves, so that lots of people, when there is a fire in one of these buildings, don&#039;t wind up burning alive.

					I would have expected that every chairperson of a building in Jackson Heights would have sent a letter to residents to say what his or her board is doing to ensure that nothing as murderous as the London fire happens in a Jackson Heights building. <br /><br />As far as I know, there hasn&#039;t been a single letter from any of them. Not one.<br /><br />It is unbelievable that not a single co-op board chair in Jackson Heights has acknowledged that there is a problem, let alone said what they are going to do about it.

					I believe that the Fillmore board and Elite, Fillmore&#039;s management company, won&#039;t get it until residents tell them that in the event of a fatal fire, there will be a demand to investigate with a view to charging board members and Elite employees personally with manslaughter if not murder. And the surviving residents won&#039;t be paying your legal bills. <br /><br />The boards of other buildings in Jackson Heights should think very carefully about that.<br /><br />And if you think I&#039;m kidding, those charges are actively being considered in relation to the London fire, including against the London equivalent in that case of what we call a co-op board.<br /><br />I have lived in a few apartment buildings in my life in three countries, and I have never seen anything as incompetent on fire safety as I have seen at the Fillmore, and what I suspect is going on generally in this neighborhood.

					I think that it is important to deal with this straight up. I&#039;m talking about Fillmore Hall.<br /><br />I&#039;d be delighted to know if I have any of this wrong, but I know for a fact that any errors are in detail, not substance.<br /><br />All in all, dying in a fire is not high on my list of preferred ways to go.<br /><br />And I suspect that Fillmore Hall is not the only building in Jackson Heights whose attitude on this subject is irresponsible.

					Unless I&#039;m missing something, Jackson Heights historic buildings are brick, lathe and plaster and in the event of a fire could go up like a matchbox.<br /><br />If there is an evacuation plan in my building, I have never been told what it is. I do know that there is no sprinkler system and that the doors between wings of the floors, if they are supposed to be fire doors, are a joke. Apart from Exit signs, there is no fire evacuation information posted anywhere in the building. To the best of my information, there is no fire alarm system. There is certainly no way for a resident to trigger an alarm.<br /><br />I have no information on fellow residents on my floor who may need assistance in the event of a fire.<br /><br />There has never been a fire drill and there has never been a public meeting with the fire department.<br /><br />I live on the sixth floor and luckily have a choice between the fire escape through a window (which I have never tried to use), a stairwell 15&#039; away and a roof 25&#039; away. I have no idea which to choose in a given situation, except that I assume (not that anyone had said so) that the elevator 5&#039; from my apartment is a bad idea.<br /><br />I actually don&#039;t know whether there is a system in my building to warn us of a fire and to get out.<br /><br />Each month, I get an envelope containing a bill for maintenance. Not once has this envelope included fire information. And there is not a single word about fire on our building&#039;s website.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our board debates how much to spend on the garden, and has no problem finding time to post notices about &quot;board approved&quot; social events. <br />

					Thought I&#039;d check the website for the building that I live in to see whether <em>it</em> might have useful fire information.<br /><br />Since the last time I looked at the site, someone has been busy putting it on Squarespace. The new site is mostly a sales pitch. It also says that there will soon be new sections on house rules and the policies on sublets and apartment alteration.<br /><br />There is not a single word about fire safety or fire evacuation.

					The London fire has got me thinking about fire safety. I have some questions.<br /><br />Does your board:<br /><br />1. hold fire drills and, if so, how often?<br />2. supply instructions on what to do on your specific floor/section of floor in the event of fire? If so, how often are these instructions sent to you and are they ever updated?<br />3. hold information sessions, preferably attended by NYFD reps, on fire safety? If so, how often?<br />4. made recent investments in fire prevention/control? If so, what investments?<br />5. in the event of a fire, have a plan to ensure that all residents are notified immediately?<br /><br />I&#039;m raising these questions because the answers, in the case of the building in which I live, are not encouraging.<br /><br />Would like to know what is happening elsewhere.<br /><br />P.S. Today the NY Times published a detailed analysis of what went wrong in London. While high rises differ markedly from the buildings in Jackson Heights, the article sure prompts one to think about fire safety: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/world/europe/grenfell-tower-london-fire.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/world/europe/grenfell-tower-london-fire.html</a><br />

					toddg,<br /><br />Great idea to start a thread about making Community Board 3 more transparent. <br /><br />It&#039;s up to the Board and erospolitico to decide whether public comments by Board members on Board issues, on this site or elsewhere, should be transparent as to identity and Board membership, or hidden behind pseudonyms. <br /><br />I find it astounding that Board members would hide behind pseudonyms in discussions about the Board, and I sure hope that that isn&#039;t what happens during your proposed discussion on Community Board 3 &quot;transparency&quot;. <br /><br />

					Queenskid2,<br /><br />As a practical matter, negative Board votes are a hell of lot more than advisory. <br /><br />As for the rest of my post, it certainly does speak for itself. <br /><br />It&#039;s called democracy.

But when a member of our Community Board comments on a thread about how the Board functions, attacks the person raising questions on a personal level, and hides both his or her name and the fact that he or she is a member of the Board, there is a big problem. It&#039;s dishonest, cowardly and sleazy.
