				I&#039;m wondering if there are many buildings in the neighborhood that have decided, some time in the 1990s, to ban the use of dishwashers or washing machines. Mine has done that, but when I bought my apt in 2003, the previous owner was still using an old washing machine. <br /><br />So I&#039;m wondering if the argument that old piping is not appropriate for dishwashers/washing machines is actually true. Has that been an issue somewhere?<br /><br />Do you know of any building around here that has updated their plumbing system to fix that? <br /><br />I know that there are more than one old buildings in the neighborhood that allow DWs and WMs, and I&#039;m wondering what&#039;s different about their piping. <br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not a plumber, so I have no idea why the piping would have anything to do with the dishwasher being allowed.&nbsp; I would think that water would be able to exit from a dishwasher drain just as easy as a sink drain.&nbsp; I could totally be wrong though.&nbsp; In my building, you&#039;re allowed to have a dishwasher, but you have to pay an additional $10/ month to offset the electricity it is using.&nbsp; I think this is b.s. too, because the dishwashers are waaaay more efficient than me standing there with hot water running while I do my dishes.&nbsp;

				That&#039;s my hunch, too. Did a huge amount of research on DWs and the way they pump water and nothing suggests it is different than just sink draining. Thanks for your reply.

				Our building has dishwashers.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; We do have a no washing machine House Rule though.&nbsp; It is true that washing machines somehow back up the water into other apartment sinks.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how or why but I know it&#039;s true.&nbsp; So they&#039;re not allowed.

				I don&#039;t understand why they are charging you $10 a month for the electricity that the dishwasher uses.&nbsp; Who pays for the electricity in your building?&nbsp; You or the building?&nbsp; I smell a scam.<br /><br />As for the drainage...the dishwasher drainage is connected to the pipes of your kitchen drain.&nbsp; It uses the same draining pipes.&nbsp; As for Washing Machines, unlike dishwashers, hold alot of water and will start to drain all of it at once...that will back up onto other drains

				In addition to the reasons mentioned below, some older buildings electrical systems just can&#039;t handle the increased electrical demand required by some of the higher end appliances (such as an electric dryer for example, or a 6 burner electric range). In order to increase the apartment&#039;s electrical panel, it sometimes may be required to increase the service from the street; a task that can cost a considerable sum.<br /><br />We recent renovated an apartment where we had to get confirmation from ConEd that our increased electrical load would not require increased service from them. If it did require it, it may have some several tens of thousands of dollars for the Con Ed work and the schedule would have been delayed significantly.<br /><br />I do find it odd that dishwashers are not allowed, though. Often times garbage disposals are not allowed, but primarily due to the structure borne sound generated by them (they would annoy the downstairs neighbor to death).

				If your electricity is included in your maintenance, then that&#039;s a pretty good deal.&nbsp; &nbsp;My air conditioners which fit in the sleeve are 3 years old, so they are energy efficient.&nbsp; My electricity in the simmer months goes up $70.&nbsp; Also many of the new appliances including entertainment devices ( TV&#039;s Stereo&#039;s ) use up alot of electricity even though they are turned off.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have an apartment in Florida.&nbsp; The only things that are running when I&#039;m not there is the air conditioner and the fridge.&nbsp; I was paying $34 a month.&nbsp; When I started to unplug every appliance with the exception of the fridge and the AC, my electricity went down to $17 a month.&nbsp; I was amazed.<br /><br />So, with your electricity being included in your maintenance, that a good deal!

				Many of the European washers have a much lower flow rate when dumping the water out, since putting a washer dryer in the kitchen is pretty typical. The downside is that these brands (bosch, asko etc.) are on the pricey side. Most american made washers rely on having separate plumbing so the draining is faster, and likely to cause backflow on sinks...<br />

				I&#039;ve heard about a tabletop washing machine (WalMart), I presume made for laundering delicates rather than by hand, and a spin dryer (no heat). Does anyone know anything about these machines, and whether I&#039;d still have the same problems as if I had a conventional washer/dryer set up in the apartment?<br /><br />Do you think the European models is what I may - unknowingly - be referring to? <br /><br />Thanks.
