				when i first came across the website advertising &quot;the residences,&quot; i thought it was a joke! first, i hadn&#039;t noticed anything different about the area (37th ave &amp; 73rd st)...and that roof deck doesn&#039;t look like anything in JH. i wonder if this development is contained to select units in a co-op. does anyone know about the residences? <br /><br />here&#039;s the site: http://jacksonheightsliving.com/

				When I first learned of the development, I thought these were condos, not coops.&nbsp; But they are, indeed, coops, and if you look at the map on the developers site you can see that one of the buildings is Birchwood Terrace.&nbsp; MCP just sold a unit in that building and the link is http://mpc.pmtlogic.com/listings.php?cid=134&amp;m=1&amp;i=20 and no mention is made of the new development.<br /><br />This is just a guess, but perhaps the developers bought all the unsold shares from the sponsor, and it is those units they are marketing?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t that have had to include a buy-out offer to all the stabilzed tenants in the sponsor units?&nbsp;

				My impression is that they are not &quot;to be built&quot; but rather they are just renovating existing units.&nbsp; The website says something about &quot;revitalized and redesigned.&quot;

				Seems Steve Madden has a big connection to Queens so maybe there&#039;s a link after all:<br /><br />info about Steve Madden big-headed girls (http://www.wwd.com/notavailable/archive?target=/issue/article/109917&amp;articleId=109917&amp;articleType=A&amp;industryKw=issue&amp;industryKw2=issuearticle) <br /><br />NO MORE BIG-HEADED GIRLS: Steve Madden may have built his brand with ads that featured cartoon girls with balloon-sized heads, but that&#039;s not the image it wants to project for its new upscale collection, Steven by Steve Madden. The company&#039;s new tag line is Steven by Steve Madden: London. Paris. Queens. That&#039;s right, Queens, because &quot;it&#039;s the new New York,&quot; declared Charles Rosen, founding partner at Amalgamated, the agency of record behind the campaign. And, coincidentally, Queens is also the birthplace of the company.

				I knew the big-headed models looked familiar! So, they were hawking shoes (and lotto tickets) before. Don&#039;t forget their animal companion, The Dog (http://www.thedog-clubs.com/home.html).<br /><br />There&#039;s now a billboard in the Roosevelt ave. subway station for the residences. I caught something like, &quot;starting at...&quot; but was rushing home. It&#039;s on the side of the station where musicians perform.<br /><br />Hm, I&#039;m still not believing that roof deck. Maybe it&#039;s just jealousy.

				I just had the opportunity to attend this open house with a friend who is looking to buy in this neighborhood.&nbsp; I was really surprised at the frenzied atmosphere -- when we walked into the apartment that is doubling as the sales office for these units, there were at least 15 people waiting to have their chance to talk to the sales agent and to be shown the model units.&nbsp; We signed up and waited around 45 minutes for our appointment.&nbsp; While we were waiting the numbers never dropped - as some people left to see the other units, others arrived.<br /><br />The crowd was extremely diverse - some families with children, many different races and ages, etc.&nbsp; Apparently the anticipated hipster influx isn&#039;t happening just yet.<br /><br />The apartments were nicely renovated and staged, and that will definitely help with sales.&nbsp; Plus the prices didn&#039;t seem unreasonable.&nbsp; While I prefer my location in the 80s between 37th and 35th Ave., I can definitely see how attractive it would be to have such a short walk to the subway.<br /><br />I think there have already been many sales.&nbsp; an interesting field trip for the day. . .

				I believe the prices were as quoted above - about $160K for a studio and 1brs starting at 210K.&nbsp; My friend was very specific with her needs, so we weren&#039;t shown prices on every available unit.&nbsp; We were told an 880 sq foot one bedroom with an alcove was available on the first floor for 250K, and I think the maintenance was in the $500 range.&nbsp; That unit wasn&#039;t able to be shown, so we were shown a mirror-image unit on a different floor that hadn&#039;t been renovated.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure it was 880 sq feet but looked to be at least 800.&nbsp; The floor plans were available but I didn&#039;t get one.<br /><br />The units that were renovated and staged were quite nice - open spaces, nice layouts - kind of Ikea style.<br /><br />The way I understand it - they have a certain number of units available now, and then when some of the market-rate leases are up, those tenants -since they are not protected by rent-stabilzation- will not be offered another lease and those units will also come on the market (unless the current tenant wants to buy, in which case it will never come on the market).&nbsp; <br /><br />The units that we went into seemed surprisingly well-insulated against outside noise, however, I can imagine that at certain times of day that the street traffic and honking can be kind of miserable.&nbsp; Also the apartment we spent the most time in was filled with people and conversation so that always makes outside noise seem like less of an issue. And on a Sunday things were pretty quiet out on the street.&nbsp; Still - the price seems right and it seems like it could be a good deal for people who want to buy in that price range and don&#039;t want to go through board approval and the hassle of renovating.

				yomarilyn asked about the maintenance, and based on my recollection (I didn&#039;t write anything down) the maintenance was $500-something for the one bedrooms.<br /><br />One thing I would ask about, though, if I were looking there for myself, is what usually happens to maintenance charges when there is a huge influx of new buyers with many former rental units being sold.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the answer to this - or even if there is a general pattern when a building sells off a large number of units, but I would research it before making an offer.

				I&#039;ve lived in the Birchwood House for 30 years.&nbsp; The building has always had a doorman starting at 4pm and yes, the building has always had a roof deck which is tiled.&nbsp; It&#039;s been closed for a couple of years and it is being renovated to what it was before with lounge chairs and plants.<br /><br />Yes, 73rd Street is very noisy because of the traffic caused by people coming from the Tri-State area and beyond to shop at the Indian Stores.&nbsp; The area has always been a neighborhood shopping area and never was meant to be a shopping mall that gets shoppers from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.<br /><br />The problem with the above is that Helen Sears seens to care more about the merchant owners than about the people who elected her.
