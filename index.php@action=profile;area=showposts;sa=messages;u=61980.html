But the program has grown to include areas that aren&#039;t otherwise under-served (e.g., LIC/Sunnyside) but exist because there was enough interest in the community.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed using the FFB weekly to discover fun ingredients and spark innovation in my kitchen. I don&#039;t know about you, but I find it tough deciding on my cooking plan for the week, so I loved getting my big bag of raw ingredients and letting that inspire me. They always included recipe ideas with each pick-up, and created a great community around the service. <br /><br />So again, not mutually exclusive with any other already available JH food options. It&#039;s just something I know I&#039;d utilize if it were available, so I&#039;m trying to get a sense if others feel the same.

What you&#039;re saying is that this is the same produce as the Farmer&#039;s Market and CSA, but massively less expensive and with no commitment. That ... doesn&#039;t make a huge amount of sense? CSA has the commitment because the farmers demand reliability in exchange for the lower prices vis a vis selling their stuff at the farmer&#039;s market, and so they don&#039;t have to pay farmer&#039;s market rent. Why would a farmer participate in this low-cost option, or is this just a place they dump their really unwanted produce? Help me understand here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was wondering that too. I thought it must be subsidized by the city, but it doesn&#039;t appear to be. This is from Edible Manhattan: &quot;The traditional CSA model involves a relationship between one farm and a member community, hence the up-front payments. Fresh Food Box is able to be flexible and inexpensive because its produce is sourced at wholesale prices from several mid-sized farms within a 350-mile radius of New York City.&quot;<br /><br />Also, another thing to note, which I guess I must have missed in the explanation above, is that you do have the commitment of having to pay for your share the week before picking it up -- kind of like placing the order and paying in advance. So there&#039;s no seasonal commitment, but you can&#039;t just show up the day of and expect to get a box.<br /><br /><strong>How Fresh Food Box works:</strong><br /><em>Visit a Fresh Food Box site near you<br />Pay $14 (or $15 at workplace sites) in cash, credit/debit, EBT/SNAP, or Health Bucks for next week’s share<br />Return the following week to pick up your share containing 10-15 pounds of fresh, high-quality produce</em><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the thoughts! Please see my reply to theplanesland&#039;s comment for more info on the financials/sourcing. <br /><br />And that&#039;s exactly right on the week-to-week commitment (vs having to sign-on for an entire season like CSAs). Since they need to know how many folks are participating each week, you pay the week beforehand. <br /><br />I never found this to be a bother: first visit I&#039;d pay for the upcoming week (or have a friend do that for me who&#039;s also participating). If you&#039;re picking-up weekly after that, you pay and pick-up at the same time. If I took weeks off here or there, I&#039;d start that process over. Hope that helps clarify!

Here&#039;s an Observer article that goes into more detail: <a href="http://observer.com/2014/07/overpriced-and-underserved-how-one-group-is-fighting-food-deserts-in-nyc/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://observer.com/2014/07/overpriced-and-underserved-how-one-group-is-fighting-food-deserts-in-nyc/</a><br /><br />Here was my take-away: Because it&#039;s a city program through GrowNYC (the same folks who run the farmers&#039; market) it&#039;s built to increase local produce accessibility, not to be a money-making venture. FFB sources from local middle-sized farms that are too small to compete on the national market, but too big to make a profit at farmers’ markets. <br /><br />I used this service consistently for 3 years, spread out between locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and LIC Queens. Produce was always fresh, long-lasting, and varied (DEFINITELY not unwanted produce, quite the contrary).

We also have supermarkets for every demographic, and that&#039;s great. That being said, I think we can handle another option. Possible location might be the new Diversity Plaza.

What I love about the FFB program is it&#039;s week-to-week but still only $15/box, so it&#039;s a great deal, plus no commitments, great produce variety each week, and no problem to skip weeks. Traditional CSAs haven&#039;t worked for me personally in the past, as you need to sign-on for a whole season, involve work shifts, they can&#039;t guarantee produce variety, and are much pricier. Especially in the summer I&#039;m away too often for this to be feasible, so FFB is a great alternative.

					Hi all!<br /><br />I moved to JH last year. And while I LOVE it here, one thing I&#039;ve been missing is a nearby Fresh Food Box program -- a luxury I had in my previous neighborhoods and LOVED!<br /><br />Fresh Food Box is a city-sponsored CSA (Community Supported Agriculture), which pools local farms for a varied selection of fruits and veggies every week. It&#039;s just $15 per week, and it&#039;s pay-per-week (no expensive seasonal commitments). At every visit you come away with a big bag of fresh seasonal goodies, and for a LOT less than it costs in stores or farmers markets. Here&#039;s more info on the program: <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarketco/foodbox" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarketco/foodbox</a><br /><br />If we wanted a FFB program in JH, they&#039;d need a spot where: <br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>at least 30 people would use the service</li><li>2 tables are available to use during pick-ups (3hrs/week)</li><li>there&#039;s room to store several items on site: tent (5 ft x 1.5 ft), box of supplies (2 ft x 2 ft), and paper bags (2 ft x 2 ft)</li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarketco/foodboxlocationsuggestion" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarketco/foodboxlocationsuggestion</a><br /><br />They&#039;d also need a point person to donate 2-4 hours/week, which I&#039;d be happy to do if this moves forward.<br /><br />So here&#039;s what I want to know:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Who else is interested in having a FFB in JH? (We&#039;d need at least 30 folks who think they&#039;d be interested, thanks for voting with the poll!)</li><li>Any ideas for a location the FFB could use? (This should be an easy spot for folks to come and grab their produce, where 2 tables could be borrowed, and there&#039;s room to store some supplies.) Thanks for leaving ideas in the comments section!</li></ul><br />Thanks in advance for any thoughts or feedback!
