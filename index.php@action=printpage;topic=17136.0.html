				Hi everyone, so last night around 1AM, there was a loud ringing that was going on for a couple of minutes I would say 10mins+ I know it is not a car alarm because that usually stops a few minutes. I believe this was an house alarm that was going off, this happens a couple of times in the late night. I&#039;m not sure which house it is; but any suggestions on what I should do if this happens again? The ringing goes on constantly and its super annoying when its late at night because the ringing is keeping me up and its very loud. Thank you

				Years ago when I lived in Astoria there was a building alarm (I think for a construction site?) that went on for days. I called 311 and since the alarm was going on at the time they patched me through to 911 and the cops took care of it.<br /><br />More info here:<br /><br />http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1030/alarm<br />

				If it&#039;s going off at the time they might be able to figure it out. I gave them the address when I called.

				There is a jewelry store on 74th St that had an alarm going off late at night and early morning. I complained every time it happened on 311 for about a week, and it hasn&#039;t happened since. Don&#039;t know what the city did...maybe just sent a letter, but it stopped regardless.<br /><br />Try to figure out the address and then start complaining. There is even a 311 category for alarms.&nbsp; Escalate to 911 if it keeps happening.

				Does anyone ever respond to these noise alarms? With car alarms, unless the owner is near to deal with it, I don&#039;t think the response from hearers is likely to be more than a muttered &quot;oh, somebody please steal it and shut it up!&quot; Especially since it&#039;s so often just a passing jolt or vibration.

				I heard a high pitched alarm at 1AM too. I&#039;m on 85th Street and have no idea where it&#039;s coming from either. The only thing I can tell is that it&#039;s south of my apartment - so towards 37th Avenue. It happened multiple times over the weekend as well.
