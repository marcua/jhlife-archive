				Well. You really should go there yourself to experience the, uh.the uh.......Well quite frankly I&#039;m not sure what I experienced!<br />The decor is yellow walls horribly painted by some one who probably likes to paint. It was not that impressive. I guess the yellow was to simulate a lemon(?) ergo the joint&#039;s name?<br />I ordered a simple appetizer of Tortellini in brodo, which I love. Only $3.95. It was not that bad. Quite good, honestly. My wife ordered grilled shrimp with veggies. It cost $18. (Sounsd like Parkside or Piccola Venezia prices). It was very good. So far..so good.. We did notice that in addition to the 2 of us, there was only 1 other party there. A couple. Total of about 10 tables. I thought.hmmmmm they better get volume to survive. Anyway, the very cordial waiter and host were a pleasure. I ordered<br />lasagne. Now how can someone mess that up? The dish came in a very hort plate and was really good. We had 2 diet cokes ( Thin sipping straw in an attractive stemmed glass. No cans thank God) I had Tiramisu and a tea. Total after tax and tip $56.00<br /><br />That&#039;s not cheap considering we could get similar prices for a restaurant with decor, (Curtains, flowers, etc) The problem is that it is not unique as far as Italian restaurant food is concerned. But the appearance is so cheap in a neighborhood where peeple look inside with the thought &quot;An Italian restaurant?? What&#039;s this?) The menu is in English only . The Italian dishes are really Italian by NY Standards, with no Colombian or Ecuadorian dishes on the side for those who prefeto&nbsp; eat their native own food. The staff is obviously bilingual, but I got a sense that the folks in the restaurant (another couple came in for a total of 6 people in about an hour&#039;s time-not good) weren&#039;t really sure what they were eating. <br /><br />My wife and I mised the Monday-Sat 11.00 lunch special ( Appetizer, main course,-including sides of vegetable and potato and soft drink) That&#039;s a fantastic deal. <br /><br />I have doubts about this place since the food is OK but the location is bad and the &quot;Experience&quot; was not good. The view out the window reminded me of a deserted town in Iraq. It was depressing. But then again, Ithaca Ave and 8nd Street isn&#039;t quite bermuda. It is very ugly.I want to hear Sinatra and be in a palace. At least there should have been more people. BTW: One of the lunch specials includes Broiled salmon, trout or Tilapia. Again the food is a condensed version of NYC Typical Italian American Dishes.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pleasure to have this hole in the ground. It belongs on 37 Ave near the Starbucks.(But I&#039;m sure the rent&nbsp; would be prohibitive) It&#039;s a cafe size restaurant. But again the decor has all the appeal of a check cashing place. But the staff is very nice (As they have to be) Please try it out and support a neighborhood place. Visa MC and AMex. No Discover card. There is no alcohol. (No vino at an Italian restaurant??? That sucks)<br /><br /><br />Oh! I forgot to tell you. Tables with attractive silverware and table cloths and rather simple pieces of Italian bread in a basket. Now that I think of it again,this place belongs on 30th Ave or Broadway in Astoria ONLY if they get their decor together. You don&#039;t go on a first date looking like a bum and then tellthe girl &quot;I&#039;ll shave very soon and fix the hole in my pants tomorrow&#039; He&#039;ll be history in a second.This restaurant had only 1 time to make a first impression. I give it a very generous C+<br /><br />PS : Totally unrelated: Don&#039;t expect the 84th /83rd street Thomas&#039; Pizza to be around in about 2 years. the lease expires then (As per Pedro the manager) and you know the rent will probably doube. No one can afford $4 slices.

				Does anyone know how long this place has been open?&nbsp; Maybe they just haven&#039;t been discovered yet, so it&#039;s good that we spread the word.&nbsp; I&#039;ll see if I stop by sometime this week, or at best next weekend.&nbsp; Perhaps you can also post on Chowhound?

				Wow! I checked out Chowhound. I&#039;m not alone. I did forget to mention two heaters in the place. Can&#039;t wait for the summer to get that natural warmth without a/c (???) I did not notice any HVAC in the &quot;dining&quot; area. Recessed lighting but please God, we need a/c in the summer if it&#039;s still around.<br /><br />&nbsp;As far as the portable heaters, I just feel it&#039;s illegal. I hope they don&#039;t get cited.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the post, sgnmath1234.<br /><br />They left a menu under my door yesterday.&nbsp; It did seem a little pricey for the neighborhood, but we&#039;ll probably give it a shot.&nbsp; The negatives you cite may just be &quot;growing pains&quot; common to a newly opened restaurant.<br /><br />If they don&#039;t serve alcohol, presumably you are allowed to bring beer or wine, right? ???&nbsp; No wine with dinner would be a deal-breaker for my boyfriend.

				Shinju:<br /><br />I&#039;m no restaurant connoisseur, but bringing your own drinks to a restaurant is a tad bold for my taste. It&#039;s like talking on a cell phone to a friend while on a date, or excusing yourself from the table at a dinner invitation to order a pizza.<br /><br />Ma, e la sua vita ! Buona fortuna !

				Really, sgn?<br /><br />It&#039;s actually quite common.&nbsp; The restaurant may charge &quot;corkage&quot; for your bottle, but as long as you&#039;re fine with that, there&#039;s no reason not to bring your own wine.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t have a liquor license, I&#039;ve never seen a restaurant have a problem with bringing beer either.

				I doubt that they would charge you corkage. This restaurant is not that upscale. As a matter of fact, it&#039;s well, kind of dumpy, but they are trying. You have to go and check it out yourself. If you&#039;re expecting something comparable with a West Village quaint little restaurant, or a Lanza&#039;s on the LES,you&#039;ll be quite disappointed. I liked the food, but being a new ethnic restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood that is sooo. ethnically un-Italian, may be a problem The folks in the neighborhood expect Colombian, Ecuadorian, Mexican not as a Restaurant for fine dining, but as a place to just hang out. I&#039;m used to going to an Italian Restaurant for fine dining. If I want to hang out and chew the fat whle eating Italian food, I&#039;ll go to a pizzeria. If this place had a pizzeria section, it would probably do well, snce Pizza is popular with all ethnic backgrounds.<br /><br />I hope I&#039;m wrong and this place flourishes. But talking about it, whether positive or negative is like talking about a movie that is so offensive or so vulgar. It&#039;s so extreme, people want to check it out because of curiousity. If you knew that a singer or other entertainer was just so bad wouldn&#039;t you want to hear him/her becaue it&#039;s the talk of the town? Not that this restaurant is that bad, but there are like a zillion comments about it in less than a week.<br /><br />(I think we&#039;re all desperate for something othet than a chicken house!!)

				Actually, I saw a number of people sitting in there at lunchtime. Not filling the place, but, it wasn&#039;t empty. Not only that, there&#039;s a sign offering Paninis for 5.00. I think they got somewhat of a hint that the prices are high.

				So husband and I made an attempt try this place yesterday (Sunday), but believe it or not, we got lost!&nbsp; &nbsp;:embarassed:&nbsp; Of course we didn&#039;t have the address on us, just my assumption that the restaurant was located somewhere near Meson Asturiano.&nbsp; I was wrong!&nbsp; We asked a few passerby, but no one was able to direct us to it.&nbsp; We&#039;ll just have to attempt our visit again.

				Has anyone else tried Limoncello recently?&nbsp; A friend of mine told me that the owner is the former maitre d&#039; of Armondo&#039;s on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; I walked by about a month ago, but was hesitant about entering because the restaurant was empty.

				Has anyone tried out Limoncello Italian Restaurant on 40-39 82nd St near Baxter Avenue?<br />It&#039;s around the corner from the Jackson Theater--many moons ago that would have meant something.&nbsp; It reminds me when Jackson Heights was a bit simpler.<br /><br />It appears very quaint inside and the prices reasonable they have lunch specials.<br /><br />I stumbled in with the children and vowed that we will try it this month.<br />Wendy<br /><br />
