				Looks like Numbers, the records store, between 77 and 78 is gone. There was a for sale sign in the window for the last month or so. It seems 8/1 was the cut off date. As I walked by this afternoon the place was dark and the owner was taking things out. Honestly. I don&#039;t know how he survived this long. Now what will we get?

				I went in there once hoping for a vinyl record store, but it was mostly CDs. There was a small bin of beat up overpriced vinyl, couldn&#039;t even find one record I wanted to give him a little support. I don&#039;t buy CDs anymore, seems a waste of money in the download age. I would love to have a neighborhood record store with decent new arrival turnover that I can browse every few days, but no way can this area support it...even Astoria doesn&#039;t have much of anything to my knowledge. We still have it really good here recordwise with all the places in the Village and Brooklyn.

				the industry has little revival from it&#039;s death. it&#039;s just not viable anymore. Speaking of.... <br />Comic Book Heaven in Sunnyside is closing<br />http://queenslove.tumblr.com/<br />August is the last month. I wish I knew more about comics b/c I&#039;m sure there&#039;s great stuff at low prices there now. <br /><br />Are you interested in records?? I&#039;m going to sell my collection next month. I&#039;m thinking I will just charge the price of the last ebay sale for each. Seriously, message me if youre interested.

				That&#039;s sad, though most of what he seemed to be doing was selling cheap trinkets and renting DVD&#039;s. I went in there a couple times and couldn&#039;t find anything I wanted. Hopefully something attractive moves in.

				For those of us old enough to remember, Numbers was the &quot;Go To&quot; place for vinyl records. There use to be a DJ in the back of the store that would spin newly released records. You&#039;d be able to purchase many of the West End /Paradise Garage releases there, some of which are now very collectible and sought after. Although it wasnt as good as the old Vinylmania on Carmine Street, it was a great place to hear house music on a Saturday afternoon. Alas, the end of an era.

				I work for a law firm that represents big pharma. they are in no way trying to assist smal independent pharmacies these days. Corporate chains, yes.<br /><br />JH is very very different than other NYC with all these pharmacies. I know the cultural reason, but it still doesn&#039;t make sense because they don&#039;t make that much money

				I peeked into this store today while they were stocking up. Technically, it is a home decor store. But in reality, it looks like every other 99 cent store on the block. Cheap, plastic merchandise and tacky trinkets. Sorry for the bad news everyone.

				There is a banner hanging from the awning that says a crafts store will be opening in a couple of days. That may not be a trendy type of business but it is by the school. Right now the only place to get art supplies is the stationery on 81 St.

				Purely &quot;Indian,&quot; there&#039;s not a lot these days. Phayul and Zomsa both have *amazing* Himalayan, and the&nbsp; kebabs at Kababish (take out only) are excellent. the takeout stuff at Tawa foods (not tawa tandoor the restaurant) are also top notch.<br /><br />Delhi Heights, my favorite, has morphed into more of a Tibetan/Nepali place. Some folks liked the departed Mehfil, but it always struck me as shopping-mall Americanized Indian.

Jeanette<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Regarding the pharmacy situation - the truth is somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; What they&#039;re doing isn&#039;t something as insidious as dealing cocaine or something, but it does involve um...<em>creative </em>uses of medicare/medicaid/govt health plans that allows them to pay the rent.&nbsp; The customer is also happy because they get to go to a pharmacist that usually speaks their language and will throw in an extra month or two, free samples, etc. as a favor. <br /><br />A lot of these types of pharmacies thrive in ethnic neighborhoods w/ a decent percentage of elderly medicare recipients across the city, so it&#039;s not a problem unique to JH.&nbsp; I am familiar with the situation in Chinatown, where you&#039;ll find tons of similar independent pharmacies.&nbsp; They are guaranteed a customer base that trusts them since it&#039;s not a sterile CVS setting with an English-speaking pharmacist behind the counter.&nbsp; The fraudish practices usually looks like this: an elderly patient with typical problems like say, hypertension and arthritis on medicare will get prescribed by their doctors (also within the community) a bunch of bells and whistles - multiple prescriptions, canes, etc. that they know the pharmacies would get reimbursed&nbsp; for.&nbsp; The patients, who tend to trust people within their own community, don&#039;t usually question these things and accept the freebies like canes or orthopedic shoes.&nbsp; These practices run the gamut - I&#039;d like to believe that most of the time it&#039;s just lil extras like getting extra gear that they probably need anyway, but other times it&#039;s wide-scale reimbursement fraud.&nbsp; There are busts on a semi-routine basis (notice both are in ethnic neighborhoods as well): http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-pharmacist-sentenced-medicaid-fraud-rap-article-1.1420443 <br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/trio-brooklyn-pharmacists-reimburse-state-400-000-false-medicaid-bill-scam-article-1.1032545<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame because fraud aside, I do think there&#039;s a natural need for their translation services and it&#039;s very understandable why an elderly immigrant would trust a Spanish, Bengali, or Chinese speaking pharmacist over the guy at Duane Reade.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of those moral gray area type things - the way the proprietors see it, they found an interesting sorta-legal niche (or not legal, but they keep getting approved for reimbursement anyway), they profit from it, and the community they serve is happy, so....<br /><br />Just some of the joys of having our wacky decentralized medical system!

				given the sort of fraud that&#039;s endemic at the high end of the insurance system -- not to mention just about every aspect of the financial system -- i don&#039;t have any problem with this. 99 percent of the time, all the little guys get screwed. here, there&#039;s a crumb of payoff for the poor and elderly. that&#039;s a plus.

				Lilywiskers, thank you for the thorough explanation. What a shame this is taking place and is business as usual.<br /><br />I have to disagree w the comment about the little guys getting something for a change. It&#039;s cliche but true--we all pay for this, little guys too in their own way. There&#039;s nothing good about fraud; these tactics will eventually bring the entire system down. It&#039;s just a matter of whose life/death it will impact. I would hazard a guess it will be the poor and elderly!
