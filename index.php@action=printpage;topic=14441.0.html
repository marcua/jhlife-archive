				A classmates mother confided they live with 9 people, not relatives in a 1 bdrm, 1 bath.<br />So when another dude criticized a middle school for being all &quot;Mitchell Lama&quot; kids, I was at least able to appreciate the fact those kids probably had more space than our current classmates. &quot;Nobody goes there, it&#039;s all Mitchell Lama&quot;<br /><br />We lack housing projects in these environs, then smirk or nod or houha about overcrowding. What kills too- overcrowded schools. You&#039;d think we&#039;d at least provide a respite from a crowded home, but Dromm and Julissa cover highest number of overcrowded schools in the city. It&#039;s easy to build a luxury residential, but not even considered to commandeer more space for schools. Why G &amp; T aren&#039;t overcrowded is beyond me, given the numbers of kids who qualify. <br /><br />

				When we were looking at houses we saw&nbsp; many houses with illegal conversions. One house had a front room with a bunch of mats rolled up and countless toothbrushes in the bathrooms. I feel sorry for them -but to be honest with the rents as high as they are how can they afford anything else?

				It&#039;s a chicken and egg problem. Rents are high so people double, triple and 8x up to afford it. This allows the market to keep charging more....which leads to more people squeezing in together to make rent. I&#039;m not sure what the answer is, but as long as people keep squeezing in and the City doesn&#039;t prevent it, I&#039;m sure the crowding will continue and get even worse.

				I just saw this news story about a 2-family house in Flushing that had been turned into a 16-room SRO.&nbsp; It was shut down/evacuated by the city, but only due to a civic group of homeowners that flooded 311 with about 200 calls (all from different people).<br /><br />What are your opinions on this?&nbsp; I am glad the city is taking these illegal SRO&#039;s seriously and that they are doing something about it.&nbsp; However, I did read on Facebook a comment from someone who is upset that this action has made people homeless.<br /><br />http://qns.com/story/2016/02/25/city-busted-massive-flushing-house-illegally-converted-15-bedrooms/

				In response to those who constantly cry about affordable housing, if you can not afford to live in a specific neighborhood, then you should move to a neighborhood you can afford - I did.&nbsp; When I hear &quot;affordable housing,&quot; I am essentially hearing people asking the government (and tax payers) to subsidize their housing costs.&nbsp; If you want nice things, you should do what many people who have nice things do, find a job that pays well and do it, and then when you make money, save some of it.<br /><br />As far as overcrowding, I do not care, for the most part, so long it does not create a nuisance.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is important to also note that very often individuals living in overcrowded apartments suck up a lot of public resources in our society and return nothing - I am talking about taxes.&nbsp; It is a bummer to sometimes feel like the only tax payer.&nbsp; But, no matter how you cut it, it is absolutely worth paying all those taxes to live in NYC - overcrowded and all!<br /><br />

They are the people we take for granted: the ones who serve the food, bus the tables, cook the food, make deliveries, work the cashiers, shelve the supermarkets, and do the manual labor. I know a house nearby me that was sold, and the basement was cleared out; it had partitions and 8 South Asians were living there. <br /><br />But even if you&#039;re not low wage labor...my friend has a decent-paying professional job and he still does a roomshare in a 2-family house that has over 10 individuals living in it. Everyone is just trying to live to see another day, and hopefully come of it for the better...or for their family to experience better.
