			Hi, my name is Dean John and I am an experienced carpenter, electrician, plumber etc in the area. I am on call 7 days and I have over ten years experience. Now is the time to fix and remodel for the holidays. My rate are very low and I do great work with perfect results. I can also fix anything and come up with solutions to the most troubling issues. I have pictures of my work and references available upon request. <br /><br />Call me any time at: 347-626-8824
