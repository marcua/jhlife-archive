				JHL&#039;s Instagram account was tagged with information about the soon to open Farine Baking Company! Pastry chef Michael Mignano plans on opening in March at the corner of 75th Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to Michael Mignano&#039;s Instagram page. He&#039;s shared a video of work in progress.&nbsp; Also below is a quick pic of the text content.&nbsp; Thanks to Instagrammer andres_pereagarzon for sharing the information.<br /><br />https://www.instagram.com/p/BtuBfREllRw/<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/pRherrI.png)

				I just watched the video again on Michael Mignano&#039;s Instagram page. There&#039;s a rendering of what I imagine the exterior will look like. The name &quot;Whisk&quot; appears on the facade. Wondering if that will be the name of the business.

				I did a search and it appears this is only their second location the other in Minnesota.&nbsp; It looks spectacular and appears to be a first class bakery/coffee shop.&nbsp; Any thoughts on how this will effect other similar businesses in the area especially like Lety&#039;s &amp; Espresso 77?&nbsp; Considering what could have gone into that space, this is an enormous plus for Jackson Heights.&nbsp;

				The results of my Google search: the owner used to have a similar shop in Port Washington, NY, which he closed in 2013. He has been on various Food Network shows including one where his weight loss journey was covered: 500 lbs to 400 lbs. And he has been in top positions in more than one very high-end hotel in NYC. I had the same thought: I don&#039;t need this so nearby! But since the weight loss journey, I would hope he might include some less-rich offerings on his menu. <br /><br />I think Lety&#039;s is a neighborhood institution with a loyal, longtime clientele, and would not be affected by this. And E77 is more like a coffeehouse in that its wine/beer offerings are a big draw, and it runs various arts events--live music at night, art talks, poetry readings, etc. This new place will be a breakfast and lunch place--E77 is busy all day but especially at night, for the events and the fact that it acts as a local place to have some beer/wine and relax--which is a function for which it has little competition around here, except for the Queensboro, which is far enough away that I don&#039;t think they compete too much for that kind of business.

Although I&#039;ve always found the bread from Balthazar to be a bit over priced, it will be great to be able to pick up a loaf of good bread when I&#039;m too busy (or too lazy) to go to Astoria. It&#039;s hard to beat the pane di casa at Gian Piero Bakery for $3.50.

				This has a very different vibe from E77. It is more a bakery and less a coffeehouse, and I see no sign that they will offer wine and beer. E77 has become a place to have drinks and snacks while listening to music in the evenings, or attending one of their poetry open mics or art talks. This place is more like Cannelle, with the emphasis on fancy baked goods, not coffee drinks/chai, etc, or other alcoholic drinks, at least as far as I can tell. I don&#039;t see why both can&#039;t thrive in JH. I would patronize both.

				I agree with Shelby re:laptop policy, and I am one of the people who often works on my laptop at the big table at E77 during the days when it&#039;s allowed.&nbsp; It&#039;s totally understandable that a small cafe cannot afford to let people occupy tables all day long. I don&#039;t know why people find this outrageous and unfair. I&#039;m just glad that E77 allows it with certain constraints, because I find it very helpful to get out of my apartment and its distractions (including spouse) in order to focus on certain writing projects.

				Looking for this new cafe opening.&nbsp; Hopefully they will not have an inane laptop/tablet policy that was mentions in other posts.&nbsp; Recently I planned to stay at Espresso 77 for about 1/2 hour, I had a book and my partner a tablet and were told you can&#039;t sit at table with a tablet. Plus they couldn&#039;t get the concept of a tea latte/tea with hot milk.&nbsp; As much as I try to like Espresso 77 it always seems to be off or lack good customer service in my opinion.&nbsp; Happy to have more options for coffee and pastry...will be tough to beat the pastries at Canelle&#039;s.

				From what I see in this neighborhood which I have lived for 35 years is the ignorance of people who feel that its okay to buy just one coffee and stay for hours tying up tables for others to use and think nothing of it. Having been an owner of restaurants in the past, I see this is selfish. With rents on the increase, a place of business, to make rent needs a turnover of tables. I see young people decamped at the various cafes/coffee places staying for hours.How selfish can anyone be. Rents in JH are huge. Buy a coffee and leave in 1/2 hour, go home and get on with your life. Just because you frequent a place and buy one coffee and stay for hours does not support a place. Turnover = rent.

				I may have already said this, but I for one just hope they have good coffee. Canelle is great, but their coffee is god awful. Believe it or not, Paris Baguette actually strikes the best balance between tasty pastries and good coffee. But it’s too far for me to go on a day that I’m not already there dropping my son off at preschool.<br /><br />Spoke to the owner yesterday as well. Didn’t get a taste test (lol), but he seemed like a really nice guy.

				Went this morning. The croissant was certainly good, not going to supplant Cannell as the best in the area but very solid. The palmier I had&nbsp; was better than Cannell’s. I hope they try their hand at the kouign amann, which cannell has but far too infrequently. It is an amazing French pastry.<br /><br />The baguette, didn’t bother since I know what Balthazar’s baguettes taste like. Perhaps they should I’ll make their own when it’s fully open. Either way a freshly delivered Balthazar’s baguette would be welcome. <br /><br />They also had what looked like amazing gelato. When they had a location on Long Island (port Washington) they offered “laboratorio del gelato”. Found a picture on their old yelp have never been.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying their burger and other brunch options!<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood.

				Congratulations to Michael Mignano.&nbsp; Judgeing by the soft opening, it looks as though it is a big hit. I was quite pleased with my first visit yesterday morning, but would like to offer a suggestion. While I&#039;m sure the cakes are very good, they are somewhat generic looking.

				Went inside this bakery Saturday and saw Balthazar bread for sale.&nbsp; There were lots of empty bread racks, so I&#039;ll be curious if they will be selling their own bread. Specialty croissants (I cant remember if they were almond or chocolate) were $3.50 each.&nbsp; Muffins were $2.50.&nbsp; It was crowded.&nbsp; Off to a good start.

I&#039;ve been 3 times since their surprise soft opening last weekend.<br /><br />Was there this morning around 8am and it was very understaffed - I don&#039;t think that they&#039;ve anticipated how much traffic it will get during the morning rush. The two workers behind the counter were friendly and helpful but definitely could have used another set of hands. There was a steady line of 5-6 customers. <br /><br />There&#039;s a new &quot;we&#039;re open&quot; sign and posted hours are 6:30am-10pm! I noticed that the bread racks were full and they also had bagels.<br /><br />As usual, the items we ordered were absolutely delicious.

				Well, it&#039;s a pretty big place so you are not pushed up against the counter. But it is kind of hectic--they are still rocky. The person who took my order seemed like she was brand new to this. She gave me wrong info about the avocado toast (said it came with lox) and forgot to give me change while she was so busy trying to get my order going. But everyone is very pleasant and nice. It&#039;s like El Rico Tinto was, with customers giving orders at the counter, and then a waitperson brings the order to the table and busses the table later. So--not exactly table service.

				I think that poster Spooky is trying to say is that they are completely working out the kinks in the soft opening and there are bound to be issues like this. I was there on Saturday and only after looking at the receipt when I got home did I realize they charged me for three croissants when I only bought two. The counter people and the register people are all new and the place is pretty crowded and I would bet the cashier who told you the prices had risen was wrong. So I too would give them another chance. If you really are steamed I suggest you ask the owner about the prices. He is often behind the counter.

				It&#039;s a soft opening and there are going to be glitches, especially considering they are probably more crowded than they expected.

				My first visit there went fine—I ordered from a young woman standing behind the pastry case, then moved ahead and paid for what I ordered and the cashier gave it to me. Tonight, they&#039;d changed the script and it did not go as well. I tried to order from a woman behind the case, but I was told I had to order from the cashier. I asked her the name of what I wanted (because, like most other things, it wasn&#039;t identified), then waited till a cashier was available. Now, she was very nice (I remembered her from before), but I told her what I wanted, and that I wanted two. She conveyed my order to one of the women behind the cases—and then she proceeded to wait on the next person in line and retrieve what he wanted <em>herself</em>. The next person behind him was waited on by the other cashier and served while I continued to stand there as the cashier discovered that the woman retrieving my order had fetched the wrong thing. She finally brought the right thing, but it was just one. Turns out I had paid for just one and was wrong when I assumed that the prices were delightfully low! So I just took the one and left, feeling very grumpy about their disorganization and inefficiency. (YES I KNOW, SOFT OPEN. But come on, paying attention to the customers when they order and paying attention to the cashier when she tells you what was ordered ought to be standard from the get-go.)<br /><br />On the plus side: the cashier was very nice and apologetic, and the key lime mini cheesecake was delicious. And I will go back again, for sure. I just hope they get better at taking and fulfilling orders.

				I&#039;ve only been once so far (two weekends ago, now): loved the items my party of 3 sampled: a couple tarts, the napoleon. Counter service was hectic: ordered with one person who gave the order verbally to another who inevitably lost track of what was said and forgot items. It was fine in the end after reminded the original person I ordered from, but was not at all efficient and added to everyone&#039;s wait time, for sure. They may have already changed this counter system. Martha&#039;s in Astoria seems to have a better counter ordering system: just ordering from the same person that rings you up. Lots of people to serve at the counter. I&#039;ll stop in again tomorrow or over the weekend.&nbsp;

				We stopped in this morning around 10:30 and the counter service seemed a little bit more organized. There was no line, we got what we ordered, and the counter person was friendly. We were greeted right away when we walked in (by a kid/young teen who I&#039;m assuming is 14 or so? or maybe younger but a family member of the owner? I&#039;ve seen this kid/young teen behind the counter there in the past) and offered a menu and asked if we wanted brunch. There&#039;s definitely been an improvement. <br /><br />There&#039;s also a sign up saying that bathrooms are for customers only, so it looks like they&#039;re aware of the issue that others have posted about regarding bathroom use.<br /><br />Our bakery items were tasty as usual! :)

One time it was my order (given to the cashier and then passed on to a counter person) that got messed up, the other time I saw it happen but my order was fine. Maybe the cashiers should write the orders out for the counter help? Or they could have the people who take your order be the same ones who fill it, which is what I&#039;ve found more often at other places. They might need to add a cash register if they do that.

				They might seem to me all about the sweets—and their baked goods and pastry items ARE stunning—but they’re really stepping it up on the savory front as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Went in today and tried their breakfast sandwich. I’m not a croissant fan and asked if they would serve it instead on one of their Balthazar baguettes. No problem. And very tasty. My wife had the quinoa and salmon bowl. Great as well.&nbsp; And the staff couldn’t be more friendly and accommodating. Farine Baking Company is a great new addition to the neighborhood and I hope they do well.

				&nbsp;I also hope they do well and the busy look when I pass by seems to bode well for that. I didn&#039;t like the confusion at the counter<br />but my objection here is different. I compare them locally to Canelles, which for me, is a standard of excellence. The Farine breakfast pastries are 2/3 the size and not quite as delectable- close but not there- and don&#039;t want to buy two of something when the other place sells one of more satisfying size. The baked goods that I have had from Farine are tasty but I still think Canelle&#039;s beats them for quality, value and great reliability. We have not had a single unsatisfactory item or experience from them(Canelle&#039;s) in all these years. <br /><br />&nbsp;And absolutely love Lety&#039;s for other more specific things...<br />&nbsp;

				So isn&#039;t it great that we have three places to choose from. Cannelle is great, but a bit out of the way. Farine is also excellent and more convenient for me. Lety&#039;s, as you say, is a great option for specific things like cheesecake, and great cappuccinos. The fact that I have 7 or 8 great Thai choices doesn&#039;t confuse or upset me. If I&#039;m in the mood, I&#039;ll go to Thailand Center Point. Other times, I might hit Ayada. Surely we&#039;re not complaining about having lots of delicious options.

				Had lunch at Farine on Friday, during which they were filming a segment for NY1 about &quot;the best chicken sandwich&quot; in Queens. They still don&#039;t have it together organization-wise, which we found both amazing and amusing, as we were not in a hurry. <br /><br />We went up to the counter and ordered, and the young woman seemed to be punching our orders into her register. Then she said we should sit down and someone would bring us the food. She did not ask for money. <br /><br />Confused, we sat down and a few minutes later a waitress came by and asked for our order. We said we had already ordered. She went away to check on that, then came back and said that no, we had not ordered because she was supposed to take our order for table service vs takeout. <br /><br />So--confusing. But she was very accommodating and sweet and the food was absolutely delicious. My husband had the scrambled eggs and salmon on a croissant, which came with salad, and I had the grilled chicken club sandwich, which came with fries. Everything was truly excellent--I&#039;m almost sorry I had that sandwich, because now I&#039;m craving it, and it was not exactly a weight-watching meal choice. I don&#039;t get why they can&#039;t get their act together, service-wise, but the food is outstanding and the staff is amiable, seem to be doing their best, and not simply neglectful--so I wouldn&#039;t avoid the place because of that. They seem to be doing very good business, which is great for the neighborhood. And they seem to be popular with people of every ethnicity you see in JH. So far I have stayed away from the pastry, but it all looks amazing.

				Grub Hub says it is &quot;closed.&quot; Sigh. I was just remarking how amazing it is that it seems like most of our restaurants are still going after all of this. I took a walk up 37th a few weeks ago and only saw one place that was permanently closed. So many outdoor cafes--and far fewer places that have closed compared with what you see in Manhattan now. Farine&#039;s was doing so well before this, it seemed. Always crowded. This is very sad. But not surprising--more surprising is that most seem to be hanging on.

				Today I passed Farine on 75th St which is closed and empty as one might expect however there are nearly ceiling-high loads of flour in bags inside the store. The branding on the bags suggests that it might be for an Indian restaurant -I am not sure if it is ordinary all-purpose flour or imported flour for Asian cooking(the wording on the bags suggests that).<br /><br />Is Farine a casualty of the virus?

				I agree that the story about kitchen renovation sounds like a cover story. Normally if a place is being renovated, they paper over the storefront and post a sign that says when the place will reopen--you know, communicate with their loyal customers. Now, they have emptied the place out and are using it for storage for the market next door without bothering to hide that fact. Are they perhaps planning to expand the market into that space? I heard the owner of Farine&#039;s is part owner of the grocery store. Really too bad--it was an amazing place with the quality of the food and the fact that it attracted a cross section of the neighborhood--it was so popular and always buzzing. Ironically, I remember feeling sorry for poor Romeo&#039;s across the street, which was always pretty empty while Farine&#039;s was bustling with customers. Now Romeo&#039;s seems to be doing quite well with takeout, delivery, and outdoor dining, and Farine&#039;s is gone.

				I wouldn&#039;t call this speculation &quot;sniping.&quot; I liked the place very much and used to order delivery from them quite often. I had nothing negative to say about the place. But now, I do think that if they are really renovating they should let customers know what is going on. That&#039;s simply good business--you know, to acknowledge that their clientele might be disappointed that they are closed, and might appreciate knowing what is happening there and whether and when they will come back. I consider that a legitimate criticism, not &quot;sniping.&quot; Calling it &quot;sniping&quot; is...well, sniping.

				I almost feel like the Jackson Heights community was used as a testing ground for Farine/MM to see what would work before opening in a wealthier neighborhood. Honestly, I feel like Jackson Heights was being used. This is a slap in the face to us loyal customers who dealt with terrible customer service (not to mention some mediocre meals and baked goods) for months while they got steady on their feet. People continued to support them during the pandemic. They barely made an effort at outdoor dining when it’s clear that it would be popular (look how busy Romeo’s is!). I hope MM enjoyed his time playing around in Jackson Heights, enjoy serving your friends out in Glen Oaks. Here’s hoping that someone invested in our community will take over that spot. <br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Canelle is better, and Lety’s is just down the street.

				I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be so harsh. I understand that it’s hard for all small businesses now and I’m happy to see that so many are getting business now with outdoor dining. I really do hope that our neighborhood businesses make it. <br /><br />If Farine is really gone I will miss it. They were the first place we ordered from once our super strict lockdown-quarantine ended. We’ve been getting breakfast pastries there regularly for months. <br /><br />That said, it’s frustrating and disappointing that a place with such a loyal and dedicated customer base closes up shop and has been SILENT about their plans for Jackson Heights when they’re seemingly doing business as usual in their other location.

				Maybe someone who had visited the Glen Oaks location can chime in, but I&#039;ve read some pretty negative reviews (ok, it was on Yelp, but needed to start somewhere) on the food and interesting why Farine would offer so many bargain meal specials when they rarely did that in JH.&nbsp; I missed the cheesecake and pastries as much as others are.&nbsp; Just seems the owner is a more competent baker than a business person.

				Happened to pass by Farine&#039;s Glen oaks location on my way to Usha Foods...it is much smaller than the one in JH--not a full restaurant, and next store was a Premium South Asian market (that is the same name as the market in JH that is next to the old Farine.

				Interesting re: Glen Oaks! I never could figure out how an Italian pastry chef who opened a bakery with extensive bakery offerings was also making special halal meals for holidays for the South Asian community--it seemed like an amazing blend of cultures and cuisines and really admirable. Now it seems he is merging his business with a South Asian grocery--possibly both here and in Glen Oaks? Just really unusual.&nbsp; Was not really into the sweets, because we don&#039;t really eat them, but the food he served was really great. I hope something good opens in that space, whether by him or someone else. It&#039;s a great location. Another JH culinary mystery story--like Swim Two Birds!

				I walked by today and noticed that there is brown paper now lining the widows. There’s one window that isn’t fully covered and peeked in and they’ve opened the back wall into the Farine space.

				Oh well...I just took a look and it&#039;s evident that the grocery store is simply expanding into the Farine space, and if you think it&#039;s going to have a counter offering fancy pastries such as Farine&#039;s offered--well I highly doubt it.

				as far as outdoor dining for Farine, going past the bus stop on 75th street, you immediately hit the parking lot, which is pretty expansive -- you&#039;d need to go a good 200 feet away from the restaurant for the first table (and that may - i&#039;m not sure - be a residence). location, location, location was great for the place until this all came down. i&#039;ll definitely miss them.

				Many bakeries are still making it by selling pastries (sweet and savory), drinks, and maybe care packages. They could do deals like a sandwich, drink and pastry or even collaborate with nearby restaurants. I think it’s a business miscalculation and a lack of creativity. Or perhaps their landlord is really harsh on him, which isn’t surprising since so many businesses aren’t making it. In any case, it was good while it lasted. Will miss the treats...

				Well, it&#039;s good to know the answer. I don&#039;t get why they told people they were putting in a new oven or renovating the kitchen. Why not be honest? You could even go one step further than just being honest and do a GoFundMe to try and keep going--but why not tell your loyal customers the truth in a situation like this? A huge number of restaurants are in the same straits and have closed or are going to close because of this. It&#039;s really too bad, it was a great thing for the neighborhood. I hope others won&#039;t be following them out of business, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been very hard to keep going, and I&#039;m afraid that come winter we might see more places closing. We&#039;ve been lucky so far--so many great restaurants here and almost all have kept going through this so far.

				Thanks KDGHP. Exactly. Saying that people wanting to know the status of a local business they value and have been supporting with their dollars and patronage is &quot;entitled&quot; is like saying someone wanting to know why their romantic partner suddenly disappeared without a word of explanation is &quot;entitled.&quot; Of course you want to know what is going on--you&#039;ve had a sort of relationship with them and you want to know: will they come back? Why did they close? It&#039;s perfectly natural and not &quot;entitled&quot; and also perfectly natural to be pissed off when you find out that they lied to you about it.&nbsp; At a time like this when businesses are closing left and right for obvious reasons, why NOT be transparent and communicate that you are trying to work things out so you can re-open (if that&#039;s the case at a point in time) or you have to close, and thanks so much to our loyal customers, and we hope to be back someday.

				This is officially the first time I&#039;ve heard people complain about having too many grocery stores. Isn&#039;t that a good thing? I love the broad range of options for grocery shopping in JH. I can find most ingredients within a few blocks, even ones that are not typically found in US grocery stores. If we lived in a food desert, I think that would be a valid thing to complain about.

				We lost something that was great for the neighborhood and was replaced with more of what we already had in abundance.&nbsp; They installed new lights that blanket the area in a eye-bleeding lumen level from dusk till dawn.&nbsp; What’s not to complain about?

				Agree with Chingwa. We&#039;re not lamenting that there is a newly expanded grocery store. We are lamenting that it replaced something unique and very valuable to the neighborhood, whereas there already are multiple grocery stores that all offer the same products. It&#039;s the same complaint that is made about the many chain pharmacies that are everywhere, offering the same products. I haven&#039;t seen the new lighting yet but it sounds dreadful.

It&#039;s obvious that many people miss Farine and I wasn&#039;t suggesting that your feelings of loss are not reasonable. It was always nice to see the location filled with customers when I passed by pre-pandemic, but I only made purchases on a few occasions. Clearly it was a popular place. Although it is horrible to see a small local business fail, I prefer a grocery store to an empty store front. I have a hard time seeing a grocery store as a bad thing for the neighborhood. If it has the same ownership, perhaps Farine will return when the situation improves to better support their bakery.

Not with folks who live in the historic district but with immigrant Desi customers. There are many immigrants who either come to JH to shop in supermarkets like this one or who live in the vicinity.<br /><br />The supermarket doesn&#039;t really need the $&#039;s of other folks. They cater to the demographic that&#039;s 80% of JH&#039;s population who are immigrants.

				How exactly does the fact that the supermarket is busy with a certain clientele relate to the eyesore it has become, which posters are describing here? Is the suggestion that for a certain clientele the appearance of the store is fine, and we who are not that clientele (ie, according to the post, residents of the historic district) have no right to complain? How do you know that the store is only patronized by non-residents of the historic district? How do you know that the patrons of the store are not also bothered by its appearance? <br /><br />Interestingly, Farine&#039;s attracted a very wide swath of neighborhood people, with customers of all ethnic backgrounds, dressed in all sorts of garb, lining up and filling its tables. The owner created special halal and holiday menus, I believe. Which was so great, and seemed so unusual for a place like that. I think it&#039;s a false contrast to portray it as a gentrification issue, where Farine&#039;s was the gentrifier, and now the supermarket is giving the spot back to its rightful owner, the immigrant community. I think a lot of immigrants were in fact patronizing Farine&#039;s, and I&#039;m sure there are non-immigrants who shop at the supermarket.

				The supermarket looks exactly like Subzi Mandi, the supermarket two blocks further down 37th Ave.<br /><br />I see very little difference in aesthetic. <br /><br />No-one has complained about the look of Subzi Mandi. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank you LJR, well said and my sentiments precisely.&nbsp; And I believe many residents - whether they have been here for six months or sixty years - and from anywhere on this earth - would hope for higher standards in ALL the shops that derive business in our community.&nbsp; There are really no excuses.&nbsp;

				When I first moved to JH from the fancy gentrified part of Brooklyn, I also thought that the stores needed to improve their design etc.<br /><br />But now, I have learned to appreciate that the immigrant aesthetic IS the aesthetic of Jackson Heights. It sets us apart. And with time, I have begun to appreciate this chaotic, colorful and often weird but original immigrant aesthetic.<br /><br />The piles of onions are fun. The loud, clashing colors striking. And the strange unknown (to me) produce has become fascinating. <br /><br />Go figure.
