				i have not gotten any masks as the paper has said that 1) health workers need them (especially the N95 type) and that 2) they aren&#039;t that helpful, and 3) are more for the benefit of people around you rather than you yourself. <br /><br />But walking out on the street, most people are wearing them. Will probably throw a scarf around my face in the short term, but are they for sale anywhere in the neighborhood? Maybe a dollar store?

				The thinking on this is changing because 1) you can be infected and asymptomatic (and thus still be spreading the virus to others without knowing); 2) given that your mouth is the largest penetration point on your exposed face, it makes sense to protect it, and 3) because they are increasingly credited with helping reduce the spread in Asia, where they have been mandated. <br /><br />Of course, if this country was prepared and the CDC pandemic unit not been sacked by Trump, we wouldn&#039;t have to choose between our health and that of our health workers. <br /><br />I bought masks by the piece from the medical supply store near the subway, though that was a while ago. There is a shortage so not sure where they have them right now. <br /><br />If you wear a scarf, make sure to not reuse it without washing it. <br />

				Sick people should wear masks to stop the spread of their respiratory fluids. Even better, stay home.<br />Masks would work for non-infected people if they wore them properly, but very few people do. They have to be worth with gloves and not removed and replaced, but tossed after each use. Since you can&#039;t really buy them anymore, the question is moot. If you can see there are instructions on the web for using filtrete air filters to create a possibly effective anti-viral mask and many people are in the process of making them for the health care workers.<br />

				It is astounding to consider that maybe if we had been able to supply every man, woman and child in the USA with a special mask (an N-95 mask, for instance)...and gloves, early on... we might have spent, say, $500 Million. And possibly avoided this whole shutdown of the USA.<br /><br />Instead&nbsp; we are spending $2.2 Trillion and having to go through all of this...<br /><br />But yes, the info concerning masks has been confusing.

				Yes, everyone should be wearing a mask. They are effective at helping to protect you, although not a silver bullet by any means.<br />It seems the communication early on was intentionally very misleading around masks, I think to ensure health care professionals had a supply.

				Everyone should have been wearing a mask since late January. Even a bad mask will prevent you from touching your face and infecting yourself that way. A good mask (an N95 mask) will also prevent you from breathing in the virus.

				This piece by a research scientist ran in the Washington Post yesterday: &quot;Simple DIY masks could help flatten the curve. We should all wear them in public.&quot;<br />https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/28/masks-all-coronavirus/<br /><br />&quot;When historians tally up the many missteps policymakers have made in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the senseless and unscientific push for the general public to avoid wearing masks should be near the top.<br />The evidence not only fails to support the push, it also contradicts it. It can take a while for official recommendations to catch up with scientific thinking. In this case, such delays might be deadly and economically disastrous. It’s time to make masks a key part of our fight to contain, then defeat, this pandemic. Masks effective at “flattening the curve” can be made at home with nothing more than a T-shirt and a pair of scissors. We should all wear masks — store-bought or homemade — whenever we’re out in public.&quot;

				If you&#039;re looking for a simple handmade mask and don&#039;t have the skills or tools to make one yourself, consider supporting an artist/craftsperson on Etsy. There are a variety of masks available and you should be able to get one within a few days of ordering. https://www.etsy.com/market/masks<br /><br />I bought one that says you can insert a filter. I haven&#039;t received it yet and am not sure what kind of filter to insert, but at least it&#039;s something.

				A bandana/seamless bandana is an option. It&#039;s a layer of protection mostly for other people. (we shouldn&#039;t be thinking about just ourselves). If you cough or sneeze, it helps stop you from sneezing on other people. They also remind you to not touch your face. I got a couple seamless bandanas (they market them for people who go to festivals to help with dusty air -- like Burning Man I guess) and wash with soap and water after each use.

				Just wonder how everyone handling social distancing. If anyone still take a walk outside daily or time to time to get fresh air.<br /><br />I been staying home for past 3 weeks and only go out once a week to get some grocery (no mask). I always see few people running or walking dog, I been thinking if I should start taking walk just to get some sunlight or fresh air or resume my running as well.

				Stay home. If you&#039;re sick you won&#039;t give it to anyone. If you&#039;re not sick, you won&#039;t get sick. It is not safe to go outside now, and probably won&#039;t be for a while.

				I went for a jog yesterday morning, but I&#039;m rethinking if it&#039;s a good idea or not to get out. Maybe it&#039;s safe, however I don&#039;t think the debate has been settled yet on how long it stays suspended in the air, how easily it is transmitted through the air, etc. There&#039;s still so much not known about the virus at this point, and guidance seems to be getting revised frequently..<br /><br />https://nypost.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-could-travel-27-feet-stay-in-air-for-hours-mit-researcher/

				I have been going outside regularly, trying to do my grocery shopping at low traffic hours, between 8 and 9. A neighbor gave me a surgical mask, and I bought ten more at the surgical supply place across from elmhurst hospital. <br /><br />My basic take is that the masks do more to protect others than they protect the wearer. I think they do provide some minimal protection, but it&#039;s like 70% protect others, 30% protect yourself. I&#039;m mainly wearing them because everyone else is. <br /><br />Also, my 2 cents re going outdoors...I&#039;ve read that it&#039;s ok as long as you stay away from others. I think being in a crowded indoor space for an extended period is where it&#039;s potentially a real problem. I think there is very little risk in simply passing people on the street, maybe a bit riskier passing people in the aisle in a grocery store, but still not terrible. <br /><br />i have now also taken to wearing gloves every time I leave the house...I don&#039;t want to touch the elevator buttons or anything else and either infect or get infected

				Okay so now many or most people seem to be wearing masks. If you have the plain variety, not the N95, and you put it on to go to the supermarket--do you really discard it and wear a new one every time you leave your home? As far as I know, they are still in short supply, so what do you do? Is it better to use a scarf that you would then toss in the laundry every time you use it? Not asking for a friend.

				If you wear a mask properly, you will protect other people from your germs. However, every time I&#039;ve gone out, at least half the people are wearing their masks incorrectly. So, again, stay home as much as possible. There is no safe way to go out. Each time you go out you&#039;re risking exposure to a disease that is ordinarily deadly to 4% of the infected, but will become more lethal as our hospital system becomes overloaded. Veg out on the Internet for a few more weeks and you&#039;ll have plenty of time later to run these errands.

				Running errands? I&#039;m talking about buying food--my post mentioned going to the supermarket. Kind of a necessity. I have found it impossible to get food delivered now, because so many people are competing for the delivery spots and you cannot even place an order to be delivered a week or two later. And if you believe that merely going out of one&#039;s apartment for any reason is so dangerous, why are you doing it yourself? You mention what you see when you go out. And one more question: where are you getting your 4% mortality rate?

				I&#039;m in no position to tell someone whether or not they should be wearing a mask in public. Recommendations from WHO and the CDC may change, but it&#039;s very much a personal decision at this time. I have noticed an increase of people wearing masks in the neighborhood, I think easily more than 50%.<br /><br />I choose not to wear a mask for the following reasons: <br /><br />1 - I&#039;ve been spending more than 95% of each day alone inside. I go out to exercise and for groceries. If I suspect I&#039;m sick, I&#039;ll be spending 100% of my time indoors.<br /><br />2 - I&#039;ve been keeping my distance from other people as much as possible the less than 5% of each day when I am in public. As we live in a crowded city, sometimes it&#039;s unavoidable to maintain 6ft from all people. On my runs, I&#039;ve been running in the bike lane more to avoid the people on the sidewalks. I&#039;m a biker too, so I know that&#039;s annoying and brings its own dangers. For now, it&#039;s what I do.<br /><br />3 - I&#039;m not considered a vulnerable population. Most likely if I do get COVID-19, I&#039;ll survive. Yes, I&#039;ve heard the stories of the exceptions, but I&#039;m not afraid. Don&#039;t even think of trying to scare me into wearing a mask! It won&#039;t work. If I decide to start wearing a mask, my decision won&#039;t be based on fear.<br /><br />4 - Our medical workers and first responders do not have enough of the medical equipment they need, including masks. Without these heroic people, we are really screwed! If you have unused personal protective equipment, you can donate it to NYC hospitals here:<br />https://ppetonyc.wixsite.com/nycppe/ (https://ppetonyc.wixsite.com/nycppe/)<br /><br />5 - I stay informed, but not consumed by the news. I avoid sensationalized news sources that take snippets of factual information and transform it into terrorizing stories that keep people clicking, reading, watching. I avoid news sources that value profit over the public good. <br /><br />On Fresh Air today there was a good interview with The Atlantic writer, Ed Yong. It has something for mask wearers and non-wearers alike. It&#039;s worth a listen.<br />https://www.wnyc.org/story/fighting-covid-19-is-like-whack-a-mole-says-writer-who-warned-of-pandemic (https://www.wnyc.org/story/fighting-covid-19-is-like-whack-a-mole-says-writer-who-warned-of-pandemic)<br /><br />Here is his very on-topic article: <em>Everyone Thinks They&#039;re Right About Masks</em><br />https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/ (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/)

				Those higher death statistics are probably because the spread of the virus is much, much more than reported/tested.<br /><br />And so the % of deaths seems higher...because many folks aren&#039;t being tested and so can&#039;t be counted as Corona cases. <br /><br />

An exhaustive article from the Atlantic:<br />https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/<br /><br />A lot of discussion about whether this virus is more airborne than previously thought.

				Thanks, Shelby. I&#039;ve very reluctantly ordered some bandanas.

A trip to a grocery store carries significantly less risk than visiting someone in their home. Like most people, I&#039;m taking extra precautions when I am in public.<br /><br />There are differing viewpoints within the medical community on public use of face masks. If you have not read the article I linked to in my post you were responding to, here it is again:<br /><br />https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/ (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-airborne-go-outside-masks/609235/)<br /><br />The title says it all! People who don&#039;t recommend masks, people who do, people who wear masks, people who don&#039;t - Everyone Thinks They&#039;re Right About Masks! We likely won&#039;t know if masks made any difference until this is all over.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is a time to put blame on any group of people - Chinese, Asians, immigrants, rich vacationers, young people, New Yorkers, people who don&#039;t wear masks, people who don&#039;t wear the right kind of mask, etc., etc. If you want to place blame, place it where it belongs - our ill-prepared government and our broken healthcare system. <br /><br />Within the past few days NYC and the CDC have made the recommendation to wear face coverings. It&#039;s important to note that these are recommendations, not mandates. One of my fears is that these recommendations will provide another reason for people to feel entitled to place blame on others. <br /><br />My biggest concern with these recommendations is that they will lead to further panic among the public and fuel another round of hoarding of supplies that our medical professionals and first responders desperately need right now. In a perfect world, we&#039;d have enough for everyone. Unfortunately we don&#039;t. <br /><br />If you have personal protective equipment that you would like to donate to NYC&#039;s medical professionals, you can do so through these websites:<br />https://www1.nyc.gov/site/helpnownyc/give-help/donate.page (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/helpnownyc/give-help/donate.page)<br />https://ppetonyc.wixsite.com/nycppe/ (https://ppetonyc.wixsite.com/nycppe/)<br /><br />I&#039;m now (mostly) covering my dirty mouth in public based on the NYC recommendation. At the moment I&#039;m using scarfs as that&#039;s what I have, but bandanas are on the way. Again, I&#039;m in no position to recommend whether someone should or shouldn&#039;t wear a mask. <br /><br />If anyone has a suggestion of a face covering to use while running, please share. The NYC Health Commissioner has stressed that face coverings should not be worn while wet. This is pretty hard to avoid when you are sweating and breathing heavily. Something inexpensive that doesn&#039;t restrict breathing would be ideal. I&#039;m finding that I&#039;m touching my face more in public when my face is covered to make adjustments - something comfortable while running is important.

				Another reason, if you need one, is to help normalize the behavior of wearing a mask. Even though I&#039;m almost certain I don&#039;t have it, due to a near-quarantine the past few weeks, I wear one in public because I want everyone else to wear one as well and I feel my wearing one encourages others to wear them.<br /><br />And there is a tiny chance I could be an asymptomatic carrier since I have gone out for groceries a few times and could have picked it up whenever I&#039;ve been out.<br /><br />So it&#039;s those two reasons why I&#039;m wearing a mask now.

(I believe it might be the same for the common cold) <br /><br />After all, folks would avoid those with a cough and symptoms who would also self-isolate...but not keep away from asymptomatic people...except for now when we have to keep away from everyone...Makes sense to wear a mask, symptomatic or not.

				Just remember that health care workers are getting sick despite training and proper PPE usage. Wearing a mask won&#039;t protect you from getting sick, but may prevent you from infecting others. The best protection is still to stay home.

				It&#039;s now required to go anywhere indoors in NY basically. Tried to go to the store today and I ran out of my usual masks this weekend (the irony) and got turned away from the grocery for not having a mask!! It&#039;s so funny because I&#039;ve been wearing masks when I go out for about a month and glad to see adoption increase (no one was doing it a month ago and I felt crazy tbh) but I think the fact that it&#039;s mandated now speaks to it actually being effective at preventing spread so let&#039;s all be good neighbors and comply :) I bought my initial batch on https://rsmmedical.com/ if anyone needs a recc and will probably reorder because I&#039;m frankly not sure how to best sanitize my homemade cloth one... would love tips if anyone has them.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I strongly suspect that children are more effective carriers than what we have previously thought. And we all know kids aren&#039;t great with hand washing, nose wiping and protected sneezing. I wish that we could look closer at how to help kids and their parents and others around them control the Covid-19 spread. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What about the idea of summer camps where the kids are together, getting herd immunity and keeping it with them?

The rate has been increasing for 31 days.<br />-Seven countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Sweden) had a weekly test positivity of 3% or higher and four countries (France, Greece, Netherlands and Slovenia) had a weekly test positivity that had increased compared to last week.<br /><br />Your &quot;only city&quot;/&quot;nowhere/everywhere&quot; claims are quite Eurocentric... masking is incredibly common in many Asian cities.&nbsp; See these articles for reference:<br />https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52015486<br />https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/11/what-a-korean-teenage-fashion-trend-reveals-about-the-culture-of-mask-wearing-393204<br />And a scholarly article citing the rate of mask-wearing in Korea as one reason for their low rates: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291980/<br /><br />As for it being a &quot;weird NYC cultural thing,&quot; we are learning new things about COVID transmission, infectivity, and treatments every day and personally, I plan to continue wearing a mask to protect both myself and my community until we understand the virus and have better prevention/treatment available.&nbsp; Wearing a mask is such a truly minor ask, I don&#039;t see what the rush to end the practice is if it may have even a minimal benefit.

				fair points...<br /><br />i personally dont mind it, but my concern is for my children.&nbsp; When you leave NYC, some people wear a mask outside, but most dont.&nbsp; it feels refreshing, they forgot about the &quot;sickness&quot; and a=it all seems a bit more normal.&nbsp; a nice break <br /><br />But here, in JH for example, everyone is in&nbsp; mask all the time.&nbsp; Since its part of the culture or the norm now,&nbsp; if you dont wear one, you get nasty looks.&nbsp; Its hard on them, they see this and pick up on all of it.&nbsp; I would argue its creating very real psychological issues, or at the very least leaning issues.&nbsp; They are supposed to be learning emotions and seeing and reading&nbsp; face is a big part of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />so im asking, if the infection rate is low, if your outside, maybe its time to take the mask off.<br /><br />

Therefore masks are still important for keeping the&nbsp; infection rate down. <br /><br />I don’t think it’s a “cultural” thing so much as many New Yorkers don’t want to go through another shut down, or for this to drag on any longer than necessary, and want it gone for good. <br /><br />There must be expertise available to advise you on how to handle it with your children.

I have a close friend that died from this disease and many that we&#039;re very ill from it, and you&#039;re worried about nasty looks?

You only need to wear a mask outside when you can&#039;t maintain social distance of 6 ft. from others.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But here, in JH for example, everyone is in&nbsp; mask all the time....if you dont wear one, you get nasty looks.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t wear my mask outside when there&#039;s plenty of space for social distancing. I rarely get a nasty look or comment. When I do, it&#039;s usually completely over the top and seemingly fear driven, not based in any understanding of what we&#039;ve learned about the virus in the past five months. The worst comment I got came only a few weeks after I lost a loved one to the disease and the person who made it was well over 20 feet from me, and that one really stung. Not because I felt I should be wearing a mask on a empty street in the morning on a rainy day, but because of the cruelty of the particular comment and how raw my emotions were at the time.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if the infection rate is low, if your outside, maybe its time to take the mask off.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can already do that as long as you can maintain social distancing, and a lot of people do. <br /><br />Look, there&#039;s lots of reasons to leave the mask on - you&#039;re on a crowded commercial street, you&#039;ll popping in and out of stores and it&#039;s just easier to leave it on, you&#039;re going from one building to another building and it&#039;s easier to leave it on than take it on and off and on again. But we can all take off the mask outside as long as we can maintain social distancing with one another. Off the commercial streets, that&#039;s pretty easy to do. When it&#039;s not, you put the mask on.<br /><br />Why do you want to keep having this conversation? It&#039;s been going on since April, when the executive order came down about mask wearing and when you need one outside, which oh, how I wish it had been issued a month earlier. So many lives would have been saved.

				I agree captain flannel. You said it more eloquently then I.&nbsp; But I disagree based on the comments above and what I see In neighbored.&nbsp; People expect you in a mask all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel like the pro-maskers have completely forgot distance and&nbsp; time of exposure are way more important than a mask.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don’t keep bringing it up.&nbsp; I just asked the question 2 days ago. <br /><br />I just think it’s funny that you u can pack like sardines at a street&nbsp; restaurant and that’s considered fine.&nbsp; However god forbid you walk down the street maskless.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess the solution is I need to walk around with a beer in hand at all times.&nbsp; &nbsp;then it’s considered culturally safe.&nbsp;

				At this point,&nbsp; not wearing a mask while walking outside in a densely populated urban area puts you at the same level as dog walkers who leave their pet&#039;s poop on the sidewalk. You&#039;re showing a lack of concern for your neighbors and yes, forcing others to go out of their way to avoid you &amp; your mess. I&#039;m talking here about mask abstainers, not folks who lower their mask when no one is around and then pop it back on when nearing a crowd.&nbsp; <br />And to everyone wearing a mask: keep lookin&#039; good!

They see examples of the extreme on the other side, which is equally as unreasonable as their own position and helps solidify their belief that anyone who would wear a mask is an extremist who doesn&#039;t value personal liberty.
