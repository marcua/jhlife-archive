				https://pix11.com/2019/02/15/paylesss-shoesource-to-close-all-remaining-stores-in-u-s-liquidation-begins-sunday/<br /><br />NEW YORK&nbsp; — Paylesss ShoeSource is shuttering all of its 2,100 remaining stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, joining a list of iconic names like Toys R Us and Bon-Ton that have been shuttered in the last year.<br /><br />The Topeka, Kansas-based chain said Friday it will hold liquidation sales starting Sunday and wind down its e-commerce operations. All stores will remain open until at least the end of March and the majority will remain open until May.<br /><br />The debt-burdened chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2017, closing hundreds of stores as part of its reorganization.

				i was talking with the manager of the 74th street store a couple of weeks ago. he seemed confident there would be cuts, but thought that store would survive because it performed well. too bad. it was a good source of inexpensive casual shoes and sneakers that you could wear into the ground without worry because they were 20 bucks

				Oh look, it was killed by a leveraged buyout. <br /><br />http://thoughtfulinvestors.blogspot.com/2017/04/why-payless-shoesource-is-bankrupt.html<br /><br />&quot;Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital took out $350 million in cash from Payless and loaded the company with debt at a time when retail was struggling from huge online competition.&quot;<br /><br />too bad keyboard warriors on this site aren&#039;t bitching about the system that&nbsp; destroys real, actual jobs.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />other examples...<br /><br />Consider the recent collapse of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. In 2005, the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Board sold the company for $6.6 billion to the private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR and the real estate investment firm Vornado. The firms put up about 20 percent of the total and borrowed the rest. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had a debt load of $1.86 billion before it was bought out. Immediately after the deal, it shouldered more than $5 billion in debt. By 2007, according to Bloomberg, interest expense consumed 97% of the company&#039;s operating profit.

				So very sad to see Payless closing where I have shopped.&nbsp; In the future you have other Jackson Heights stores&nbsp; that are at risk such has GNC, Rite Aid and Vitamin Shoppe.&nbsp;

				Losing another two stores in Jackson Heighs makes it even more crazy to me that some people are trying to chase away Target which wants to invest in the area and provide jobs.

				even chains can&#039;t survive in this climate. it&#039;s daunting for smaller retailers. frankly, i&#039;m amazed that GNC has made a go of it, given the $9000 per month rent that was mentioned around the time they opened. not wishing them ill by any means, just surprised.

				I have never bought a pair of crappy shoes at that store. There are many better options to buy name brands shoes online these days. I used to buy shoes at Sports Authority but they disappeared. Also I read that Walmart sells crappy shoes cheaper nation wide. This is no real loss.

				&nbsp;We will also miss Payless. Sometimes a particular type of shoe was needed by someone in the family on short notice<br />and you could trust that they would have something affordable even if it was dress shoes that might not get much<br />wear. Will be sorry to see them go.

				i liked the chain for cheap kick around shoes so i will miss them. and if you buy shoes online, without seeing or trying them on, you get what you deserve.

Lol. Sorry, that was just an easy in. Can’t say I was a Payless fan, but interesting (as an “Ad Man” *cringe*), because they just pulled off a very much talked about advertising stunt last year that got a lot of attention. Look up Palessi.
