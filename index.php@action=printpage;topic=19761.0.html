				walked by today and saw they&#039;re taking online orders only -- no in-store hangouts. better safe than sorry, and please do continue to patronize them.

				I just checked their online order form. Wow! They have a huge selection, and it&#039;s not just cheese. You can also get things like salami, smoked salmon and other fish, whole milk, plain yogurt, olives, bread. And it&#039;s a contactless pickup - you wave from outside and they bring out your order (that you previously placed online).<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely going to try it.

				i did it yesterday. super-smooth process. clicked my choices on the order form and got the confirmation on Monday evening. Steffan called an hour before my time window to tell me it was ready (all items i asked for were as requested), and ran my credit card. walked over, the stuff was handed out the door, and i was on my way. <br /><br />for what it&#039;s worth, they&#039;re doing good business during this period of limbo. that&#039;s reassuring.

				Very reassuring, both from the standpoint of their business success and our access to food. It&#039;s becoming impossible to get grocery delivery from the supermarkets now--all slots filled at all stores yesterday, and you can&#039;t even place an order for a week from now--and this is such a great option. Contactless, outdoor pickup with no need to go into a store and stand in a line, and with many different items available. I hope they can keep up with demand, which I&#039;m sure will be increasing for them.

				Ordered twice from them in the past couple of weeks. As dssjh says, smooth ordering and pick-up process. And yes, they have other products like bread, olives, jarred pickles etc.

				I just tried to place an order for today.&nbsp; They&#039;re not accepting any additional orders (Saturday) as a result of a large volume of orders.&nbsp; I&#039;m not at all upset since this is great news for the owners who will obviously survive this crisis.&nbsp; &nbsp;
