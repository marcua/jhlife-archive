				Title: <strong>Petition started for &quot;compromise&quot; on 34th Ave Open Streets</strong><br />

				This past week, the City Council approved making the Open Streets program permanent. Since the mayor suggested this originally, I think it&#039;s safe to predict he will sign this. Streetsblog is reporting on a petition to compromise on creating a permanent green space on 34th Ave. The &quot;compromise&quot; is long on promise but short on details. Everyone will get everything, but it doesn&#039;t appear obvious to me who will make these things happen. The article is at https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/05/03/the-compromise-new-open-streets-group-seeks-linear-park-for-jackson-heights (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/05/03/the-compromise-new-open-streets-group-seeks-linear-park-for-jackson-heights) and the petition is at&nbsp; https://www.34avelinearpark.com/ (https://www.34avelinearpark.com/) <br />The article quotes a supporter who says that tens of thousands of people use the open street each day. If that is not an exaggeration, then by all means support the petition! I haven&#039;t seen any real count of how many different people use 34th Ave, but if there is one please post a link so I can educate myself. <br /><br />Whatever happens, someone has to prevent delivery scooters and electric bicycles from using this street when other vehicular traffic is prohibited. They rarely follow posted speed limits, often ignore traffic signals, and don&#039;t seem to understand that this is supposed to be a pedestrian pathway, not a short cut set up for their convenience.

				&nbsp; I think this summers activities and the actual use of 34th Ave will play a big role in how the final decisions are made about permanence. We need to see what the electric vehicles situation is, large group cyclists moving through en masse and ultimately, in the fall, when we have a closer to normal situation we will see if commuter and local small business traffic can withstand this closure for this times that are currently in use. Things could change a lot once we see how the summer goes.

				<span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">this is actually not the real petition for compromise, it is to create a linear park in 34th Ave. 34Compromise.org has been the group that&#039;s been working on reaching a compromise and has its own petition. You need to stop lying to people and trying to pass as this is our compromise campaign. I don&#039;t know how your group is so comfortable with being this way, but you should really stop.<br /><br />The people who have found out what the petition was really for feel lied to. This is the real petition for compromise https://airtable.com/shrEAOOfWeUg9kvFO in 34compromise.org you will see more information.</span>

				there&#039;s so much anger in the anti-open street group. i was lukewarm in favor of 34th remaining open until the shouting started and pushed me firmly into that camp.

				&nbsp;That&#039;s funny because I see a lot of anger, evasiveness and manipulation on both sides. It&#039;s an unpleasant situation and there is a need for some political or governmental group to see who is really doing the work to keep 34th Ave open vs. who is wanting some personal gain as leader or innovator or god knows what. They are dedicated volunteers and then there are people who are spouting lot&#039;s of crazy here. The whole Open Streets story with restaurants, etc. will probably not be decided this year either. The variety of experiences that are good and bad needs to stabilize to properly evaluate a change that is this big and this sudden. <br />&nbsp;Personally, think the good parts of 34th Open Streets is negated by the excessively long hours with sometimes very little use and the length of blocks that is so much larger than any other street closure in all of NYC by a lot! Feel sorry for anyone trying to sell property on 34th Ave.

				According to the petitions pro and anti, the numbers who are for an open 34th Ave are DOUBLE the number who are against it.<br /><br />This means that selling property on 34th Ave appeals to quite a majority of folks.

So I am unsure who folks think they&#039;re fooling when they do not correctly describe the true situation. No-one is fooled. <br /><br />It makes the counter arguments look irrational.

				I have not owned a car in over 30 years, but certainly understanding the upset over the open street is not difficult.&nbsp; Having to get out of your car to move the barricade and then to move it back has got to be one big pain in the butt.&nbsp; Not to mention having to do it in the rain, with an injury, dodging pedestrians, bikes, scooters, strollers all the while.&nbsp; Further, the complaints with regard to noise seem founded and it seems the additional traffic on surrounding streets has brought congestion and an absurd amount of honking at times.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I love the open street, but in all truth.......it is absurd.&nbsp; There&#039;s a nice wide sidewalk.&nbsp;

				Keep dreaming if you think this will be anything like the High Line. Look at the mess that is Diversity Plaza, hardly kept up like the outdoor seating plazas in Manhattan.&nbsp; Another project supported by Danny Dromm. Last time I walked on 34th Avenue, there seemed to be an increase in vendors--not sure who is regulating that.&nbsp; One was blaring music.&nbsp; There is still a lot of thought that needs to go into what will become of the Open Street on 34th Avenue.

				Just because you begin an article with the word Compromise doesn&#039;t mean it is. It is more a clear manipulation of the media. 34th Avenue is underused, as an open street. But serves to make life for those of us who actually live on it much more difficult. How has this made the area safer? It seems to me that it has simply caused the rest of the streets in Jackson Heights to become overused, increasing the honking and generally made it more dangerous for pedestrians and drivers alike.<br /><br />This is largely an immigrant community, if your car is not your livelyhood it is certainly a sign that you have &quot;made it&quot; here, cars<br />are not going away in Jackson Heights. I also don&#039;t think that the DOT should be engaging in city planning which they have proven to be unqualified to do. When you plan to address access for Acess-a Ride and garbage after the closure, you clearly are not qualified to plan.

				As a long time JH resident, I am struggling with open streets, I love the outdoors and for many years, have jogged and walked in this area. I own a car, and park on the street like many others. I have seen this neighborhood change throughout the years, and the open streets program has not changed it for the better. It has caused a tremendous amount of traffic in the surrounding areas, more noise, trash on the road and more congestion (people and cars) in the area. There is a great outdoor space on 78 St. that is there to serve our outdoor needs. The sidewalks are quite large and there is plenty of room for everyone. I have been able to run outside with no issue prior to open streets. When kids go back to school and people actually commute back to work, what will be the need? I can guarantee the majority of walkers and people enjoying 34th Ave, don&#039;t actually live on 34th Ave. I do and I struggle with even trying to slowly drive on my street. I get dirty looks, cursed at for trying to park, and yelled at for driving. I was under the assumption this was a &quot;shared road&quot;, so then share! If there is a driver on the road, we really just want to either park our car, or get out of 34th Ave, so we can sit in traffic elsewhere. I think the people walking and enjoying the street should be fair and see the other side as well. I don&#039;t see the benefit, if you want to walk there is plenty of space and there are parks throughout NYC. I don&#039;t really see a plan, a major street closed for people to walk? We have sidewalks for that. Metal barricades that block cars? Drivers have to get out and move them, fine, whatever, but sometimes there are 2 which is really obnoxious. For a shared road, it seems really one sided. It&#039;s dumb, I think it&#039;s pointless and don&#039;t see a long term benefit. I will gladly sign a petition for this not to continue. If you want to be eco friendly great, don&#039;t get a car, get a bicycle and follow the traffic rules, but don&#039;t judge or fault others for making the choice to have a vehicle. I guess DiBlasio will be making more of a mess than he already has by keeping this open.

				there was never&nbsp; overwhelming support for Target or the abandoned mass of bricks. local merchants -- largely our neighbors -- were opposed. lots of folks who prefer keeping Cincinnati-ization at bay were opposed. Target is not inherently bad, but it does contribute to the dilution of a neighborhood feel.<br /><br />and Pizza Boy makes a decent slice. it&#039;s no Louie&#039;s or Sam&#039;s, but it&#039;s not bad.

				&nbsp; We have THE WRONG STREET for JH Open Streets. <strong>It should be 37th Avenue</strong> which might in some way compare to the only other closure that most people consider &quot;successful&quot; in NYC. <strong>This is Vanderbilt Ave in Brooklyn which is a commercial street!!!</strong> Not a residential street like 34th Ave. On 37th Ave, there are places to dine and meet up with people, amenities already exist on 37th ave and most importantly, we would be supporting our beloved restaurant and business community which is in high need right now. The lunacy of using 34th Ave for Open Streets and making it into something it doesn&#039;t want to be, is a travesty. Luckily, NYC Parks and DOT are not moving quickly so time will provide some interesting answers on use and who is doing the long term maintenance and who is patrolling the misbehavior, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s come to our senses here and move this to 37th Ave and make it right for all of the Jackson Heights community in the long term. We need to consider all of our residents and businesses here.

				My god, you are all absolutely hilarious.

In the mean time, the stack of drunks outside of the former Burger King on 82nd has grown from five to ten (great welcome to the neighborhood).

				the fine was (and may still be) $350. i&#039;d be willing to bet the NYPD hasn&#039;t issued a single ticket for honking anywhere in Queens in 2021. too bad, that would be a great source of income.<br /><br />edit to add: we had one of those signs on the light pole right outside our living room window. the honking was constant, even when a police car was parked at the corner.

				Well, if a $350 fine is imposed on honkers for a week, I would say that problem will be quickly eliminated.<br /><br />And other drivers afflicted with Road Rage will hear about it. And stop their honking.<br /><br />The press would certainly pick up that story.

				Yes, addressing the many other issues in the neighborhood vs. only focusing on the Open Street would be great.&nbsp; As someone mentioned, there are now about 10 homeless in front of Burger King on 82nd Street, doesn&#039;t seem any of our leaders think that is an issue.&nbsp; When I last passed by they were drunk, aggressive and it seemed like piss on the Street.&nbsp; The honking and noise on surrounding Streets has become worse since 34th Avenue has been closed--the worse noise du jour IMO is from loud (and illegal) dirt bikes zooming by at all hours.&nbsp; Does our precinct patrol or do anything about this?&nbsp; I read in other areas they confiscate these illegal vehicles--all the people hating cars don&#039;t seem to have an issue with this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Passed by the Open Street today around noon, a beautiful day and looked up and down the Street and saw few people.&nbsp; I am not opposed to an Open Street, perhaps weekends make the most sense, as well as folks who think a commercial street, such as 37th Avenue would make sense to help restaurants.&nbsp; Also wondering when we get back to parades in the neighborhood --will they now be on 34th Avenue, or do we end up closing both 37th and 34th--definitely would pack up then, as 35th Avenue would be a horror.&nbsp; Hope we can get to a compromise that makes quality of life better for all constituents.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I love living on the open street and the only noise I hear is from car radios in the cross streets. It&#039;s used constantly. I have video of 28 people using it within a minute&#039;s worth of time around 5pm and I&#039;m happy to share it with pro-open street forces. Now I&#039;ll be sure to take more video at different times just to document it for the linear park forces. <br /><br />People are selfish and resistant to change.

				See quotes below from todays New York Times, and yes it is clear people are having a conversation but they are hesitating about the word compromise. And yet, that is clearly what is needed here on 34th Avenue with the street closures. Just like with the vaccine rollout, we should be mindful of who runs up to the mic to speak and who is hesitant and has real questions but is fearful of backlash. Read below as clearly, the politicians are walking a tightrope on this issue. JH is not a transit desert but many people and businesses and school have vehicle based needs here and do not feel they are being&nbsp; given the same platform to speak freely without some snark or name calling. If it was so clearly a win for everyone why aren&#039;t any of the mayoral candidates saying so??<br /><br />“People talk about streets in the context of the future of the city and what the city will look like,” said George Arzt, a political consultant and former press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch. “They want more parks and bike lanes. They want a better quality of life.”<br /><br /><strong>Still, the issue becomes “a real migraine for candidates,”</strong> Mr. Arzt added, because the next mayor will have to strike a balance between the push for a more livable city and the daily demands of businesses, emergency services and New Yorkers who depend on cars to get around, especially in transit deserts outside Manhattan.

				I saw the barricades on Northern Blvd today (Saturday Aug 7th 2021) <br />It looks like the Annual Ecuadorian Day Parade will take place on Sunday, and I believe this means that 34th Ave will be open for traffic.&nbsp; <br />I am anxious to see how this works out. <br />

				^good thread to include this on. It looks like the Compromise Group (and now the OS Resisters), lobbied the 115 to shut down OS because of the parade. Except of course, the problem is that the OS Program was passed and signed in to law by the City Council and the mayor, so therefore the police department can&#039;t just modify OS whenever it wants (save for example a true emergency situation such as a chemical spill), and seems like they were reminded of that requiring an abrupt about face on their announced street closure (opening?) of 34 OS. <br /><br />My understanding is DoT runs the program and determines when to shut down Open Streets (like for plowing), and it looks like they aren&#039;t inclined to do so for parades.

				&nbsp;I seems plausible that somehow, someday, a true analysis of use vs. desire will come to fruition here with the DOT. Looking through cameras, aerial and on ground and seeing the actual traffic patterns will reveal what is plausible with the excessive 8am- 8pm closure during the pandemic and the impact to the whole neighborhood. <br />&nbsp;<em>On a separate note</em>- is it time to revisit our crappy sidewalks in JH? Some are horrendous and no wonder walking in the street is preferred for that aspect. Could be fixed maybe with infrastructure bill??

				I have a hard time believing people who say they actually live on the open street and don&#039;t find it a noisy nuisance. I live two avenues away and I&#039;m against it because, contrary to whomever says the open street is about favoring peds and bikes, open streets robs us of a bike lane. The bike lane on 34th Street is completely non-functional if it&#039;s blocked by people, vehicles, dirt bikes, kids on tricycles, yoga sessions, etc. As vendors roll in and people start setting up lawn chairs on the median, it&#039;s becoming less and less of an urban oasis and more like a neighborhood blight. Do it on the weekends! Rest of the time, give us back the bike lane and let people actually maneuver around. I would hate to have spent my life savings to buy a quiet apartment on 34th Ave only to face this. Just one NYers opinion.

				Probably the truth is that Jackson Heights is divided into two separated populations. The Historic District and environs and the rest of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />I suppose folks in the Historic District don&#039;t particularly care about what happens in the rest of Jackson Heights. Drugs, &#039;massages&#039; and gangs. Etc.&nbsp; As long as these urban crimes don&#039;t impinge on the Historic District. <br /><br />But the Open Street of 34th Ave appears to mix up the situation. The rest of Jackson Heights is encouraged to enjoy the Historic District with the Open Street.<br /><br />And maybe that&#039;s why the topic is such a hot potato?

There&#039;s no need to ignore other residents&#039; concerns because you don&#039;t share them. Open Streets provides me no benefit. My daily walks on 34th Ave can easily be completed on the sidewalk. <br />Most of the people I observe using the Ave on weekdays are bicycle riders and people using electric vehicles like scooters and mopeds, as well as a few joggers. The volume of pedestrian traffic is very low. The only real use if the Open Streets I&#039;ve seen recently was for the summer day camp, which appears to have ended. I&#039;ve never seen more pedestrians in the actual road than would fit comfortably on the sidewalk. This level of usage hardly qualifies as a godsend.<br />Try to resolve people&#039;s concerns and most complaints will fade away.<br />

There&#039;s no need to ignore other residents&#039; concerns because you don&#039;t share them. Open Streets provides me no benefit. My daily walks on 34th Ave can easily be completed on the sidewalk. <br />Most of the people I observe using the Ave on weekdays are bicycle riders and people using electric vehicles like scooters and mopeds, as well as a few joggers. The volume of pedestrian traffic is very low. The only real use if the Open Streets I&#039;ve seen recently was for the summer day camp, which appears to have ended. I&#039;ve never seen more pedestrians in the actual road than would fit comfortably on the sidewalk. This level of usage hardly qualifies as a godsend.<br />Try to resolve people&#039;s concerns and most complaints will fade away.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So many folks speaking for those who live on 34th Ave...it’s GREAT to have someone who really lives there.

				I live on 34th ave. I&#039;m in favor of the open street,&nbsp; but I know it can be better, one issue obviously being that bikers need a designated lane, for everyone&#039;s safety. I also believe the hours being reduced in the winter months is a reasonable request.

				I live o 34th Ave, facing Open Streets. It has done nothing but cause more headaches...parking nightmares, trash, traffic, and everyone that has an opinion (especially those not for it) face backlash. Sorry, but open streets has not done anything to improve quality of life. Most days it&#039;s empty so I struggle to see the payoff. If you want to improve the quality of life in all of JH, look at 82ND ST. Pay attention to the areas outside of the Historic District.

				I’m not sure most car-owners would call themselves “car lovers.” It’s just for some of us getting out of the city, or around the city with a pet, is nearly impossible without a car. I also regularly bike, and there’s nothing “pro bicycling” about the open 34th Ave as it eliminates the one true east-west bike lane and replaces it with an obstacle course.<br /><br />Jackson Heights desperately needs open space—and I’m happy to see people make the best of 34th ave—but wouldn’t 37th ave be the smarter street to close down (to non commercial traffic)? The sidewalks there are horribly overcrowded, and double parking is a mess that brings traffic to a halt anyway. Why not open it up, give the restaurants more outdoor breathing room, allow for more room to roam, and more space to play and hang out? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=20521.msg103904.html#msg103904">Quote from: abcdefghijk on August 28, 2021, 01:43:08 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I suppose at its core, the conflict about Open Streets is really about car-lovers vs the car-free. <br /><br />And this microcosm of disagreement is really an example of where cities are heading.

The ones with the constantly double-parked mid-day delivery trucks, and also the ones with the double and triple-parked out-of-town SUV shoppers. 37th is actually not a truck route, but is used as a truck route thoroughly and frequently. <br /><br />34th never had that level of constant commercial traffic; it also has the median, the shade trees, the multiple schools and the park. So 34th can function as an extension of the park, solve some of the issues with schoolkids crossing the street (especially with the IS230 building layout), etc. <br /><br />There are some bigger issues around the assertion that &quot;you can&#039;t have groceries in the neighborhood without double-parking tractor-trailers in the middle of a busy street at midday&quot; that really nobody at any level of city management or design wants to have to even think about. Obvious answer is to make each block in front of a grocery store a loading-only zone, but for some reason no, that&#039;s not a thing we can do.

Why not open it up, give the restaurants more outdoor breathing room, allow for more room to roam, and more space to play and hang out? [/b]<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that when this JH Open Street situation is properly analyzed by all the depts in the city that need to consider the implications, another street BESIDES 34th Ave. Time will tell but there is so little conversation about less abled people - elderly and wheel chair bound, those whose jobs mandate a vehicle and people who prefer a more defined walkway (not including bikes in same area). Have said before that 37th is a MUCH better choice and hope that the conclusion of the professionals is the same. We have moved up the ladder with more park space in JH and if private gardens (we have a fair amount) and rooftop spaces are included, we would <br />be seen as providing more recreational space. But we have some fabulous gardens which will be profiled in JHBG&#039;s upcoming Garden Tour. Still really, really need an all weather, all abilities, all ages community center though.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Some people have pointed out that residents of 34th Ave are enjoying the Open Streets and have seen their property values increase because of this program. Perhaps these residents would be willing to share their bonus value by funding this initiative via increased real estate assessments so that the city could hire people to properly enforce the participation rules, ensure the safety of all, and possibly direct traffic on 35th Avenue?<br />Once again, the opinions of 34th Ave residents are not the only opinions that matter. 35th Ave was flooded on Thursday yet cars had to re-route to the already over-crowded 37th Ave and Northern Blvd.<br />Many thanks to the volunteers for their efforts, but this needs to be funded and staffed if it&#039;s too be fair to all.

				Yet again, people (with agendas) speaking for others. <br /><br />It is always great to hear what the real people who live on 34th Ave say. <br /><br />We have heard some already on this thread.<br /><br />And, interestingly, it is often nothing like what the folks (with agendas) proclaim.

				Too much to quote and edit, Captain Flannel, but 35th Avenue was flooded between 69th and 65th Streets by the BQE. In the morning it was impassable, and in the afternoon only the bravest (or most foolish) of drivers attempted to get through. Nice job formatting, BTW.

				^I&#039;m out on 34th Avenue multiple times a day - morning, afternoon, evenings. I do a little data collection most times I&#039;m out there.&nbsp; I sit down on a particularly shady block, and count the number of people that cross the crosswalk over the course of a minute. The smallest number of people I&#039;ve counted has been 5. The largest was 24. Even on the days when it&#039;s been raining heavily out (looking at you Memorial Day weekend), there were people on the avenue.<br /><br />It&#039;s fine to disagree about what constitutes high or low usage, but it&#039;s disingenuous to say no one is on it most of the time. Foot traffic, just like car traffic ebbs and flows. There&#039;s very little traffic on 35th Avenue right now, but it would be incorrect to say there is no car traffic on it.<br /><br />Also, DoT does seem to be responsive to usage. Sunnyside&#039;s Open Street, which didn&#039;t seem to work, is being turned in to a bike blvd. 34 Avenue OS got planters and a few employees from the city. All signs point to DoT thinking it gets enough foot traffic to warrant further investment, at least for now. It will be interesting to see what they come up with they unveil their plan come fall.

				&nbsp;Captain Flannel, with all due respect, in this age of technology it makes much more sense to use the available tools to accurately record the use of 34th Ave. Anecdotal accounts are passionate as noted here on this forum but those of us who have more to do with the avenue 24/7 know what we see also. Let&#039;s let the truth be determined in a bipartisan way with cameras recording and having the data analyzed and charted showing once and for all, the actual use of 34th Ave now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Those most affected need to have others understand the full story on this very divisive issue here in Jackson Heights!Also those planters blocking access to the fire hydrants on a street where a massive fire happened earlier this year are unbelievable idiotic to residents on the avenue whose lives would be at stake should there be a need to use the hydrants quickly.

				Itsit there are lot of legal and privacy considerations to take into account for the methodology you are suggesting that would actually make a count using recorded video tricky. The method that CaptainFlannel just outlined is actually what is used for a lot of survey data (think MTA train usage collection). Folks take a a manual count over a given period of time -- average and multiply it out. <br /><br />For what it is worth, I live on 34th ave, and am a car owner in the neighborhood. I am supportive of the open streets program and, anecdotally, see the open streets being used pretty continuously by where I live. I enjoy that there is now space for residents to use, and also don&#039;t find it to be a hindrance with my car -- as long as (careful and slow!) parking is allowed to remain, I am happy :) I haven&#039;t encountered any noise issues -- the biggest issue I have encountered are speeding electric bikes/scooters.

				All of those users (except the ??cross town buses??) can and do currently utilize 34th Ave for access and specific needs at any time of the day. There is still parking all day long on 34th Ave except for a block or two for play spaces. <br />Your arguments sound like they are based on the premise that the blocks on 34th Ave are entirely off limit to vehicles, which is clearly not the case.

				No biker in their right mind stops and waits at a red light when there are no cars around and they are crossing an open street. I slowed, checked both ways, and rolled widely around the couple.

				By &quot;rolled&quot; do you mean ridden or walked?<br /><br />Look - I&#039;m pro bike. I think there should be protected bike lanes everywhere where there is a road. But intersections are where cyclists by their recklessness do damage to the reputation of other cyclists.<br /><br />If the light is red, <em>Walk the bike across like the pedestrians that are legally allowed to use the crossing.</em> If you&#039;re riding it, you&#039;re riding through a red light and breaking the law.

				So I needed to bring my car to the neighborhood this afternoon from where I have it garaged in Woodside. Northern Boulevard was jammed up in both directions because southbound 80th and 82nd Streets were backed up and at a complete standstill. Why? -- It was 2:15pm and schools were letting out. If this is a regular occurrence on school days, it&#039;s just another reason the 34th Avenue open street needs to be reevaluated with a comprehensive traffic study that takes into account traffic patterns and congestion from 69th Street to Junction Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue to Northern Boulevard.

				It&#039;s ironic that the same people who seem to think that cyclists and pedestrians somehow cannot navigate each other safely on a wide open street are clamoring for the return of cars and trucks to 34th Ave. <br />And yes, the whole neighborhood is full of traffic when school lets out, as well as during evening rush hour when thousands of cars use our neighborhood as a through route to points east. The return of vehicle traffic to 34th Ave will not change that, it will just be yet another congested street. <br />I think the city should suspend the program for a week or two and let people see that there will still be heavy traffic and honking throughout the neighborhood without the open street. Of course people will not realize that, because they only see what they want to see. <br />We live in a city plagued with reckless drivers who cause thousands of serious injuries and couple of hundred fatalities each year in this city, yet a bicycle passing a pedestrian with a few feet to spare is supposedly the danger because &quot;it&#039;s against the law&quot;. <br />Common sense is truly dead. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Let&#039;s be realistic. Traffic fatalities have risen dramatically since the onset of the pandemic because of the nonsense of open streets, bike boulevards, and outdoor dining sheds. Not because the drivers have suddenly gotten any worse behind the wheel, but because all of these programs create chaos on our roads and cut down on the visibility of pedestrians and cyclists. Frustrate or confuse drivers with narrowed traffic lanes, new traffic patterns, or obstacles that simple shouldn&#039;t be there (such as the dining sheds) and it should come as no surprise that collisions and fatalities are on the rise.

				Your claim that traffic fatalities are rising because of open streets, bike boulevards, and dining sheds is ludicrous. <br />Fatalities are up because drivers are confused by traffic patterns or fixed structures on the shoulder of the road? On what planet does that even sound reasonable? Do traffic fatalities go up wherever there is road construction?<br /><br />Perhaps you haven&#039;t noticed the plague of reckless driving, the rampant failure to yield to pedestrians, the lack of any significant police enforcement, or the proliferation of bogus and often expired temporary plates i.e. unregistered and uninsured vehicles that flout laws with near impunity. <br />Here&#039;s some stats regarding the lack of enforcement. You can find the raw data here https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-archive-2021.page<br /><br />In June, 2021 (the last month for which there are full-month stats), cops citywide wrote just 39,777 total moving violation tickets, which is down 51 percent from the 82,229 moving violations cops wrote in June 2019. Specifically, in June, 2021, cops wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,308 failure-to-yield tickets (down 55 percent from 5,208 in June 2019)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 7,777 speeding tickets (down 35 percent from 11,993 in June 2019)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2,623 tickets for running a red light (down 56 percent from 5,933 in June 2019)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,882 tickets for improper turn (down 72 percent from 6,857 in June 2019)<br /><br />Through Sept. 1, 172 people have been killed on the roadways — including 80 pedestrians and 17 cyclists or micro-mobility users. <br />Yes, based on the numbers it surely must be because of the opens streets, bike boulevards, and curbside dining shacks /S.&nbsp; <br />

				There&#039;s clearly no point in trying to engage with you further on this matter since we are both firmly entrenched in our positions. <br /><br />As you previous stated, people only see what they want to see and that is certain true for you and other members of the anti-car crowd. Maybe if you owned a car and drove these city streets as I do, you&#039;d be more aware of all the pedestrians and cyclists who ignore their own safety, common sense, and the rules of the road, placing themselves and others in danger.<br /><br />Just curious if the NYPD keeps data on tickets given to cyclists and pedestrians? Maybe more enforcement there would help, no?

				I&#039;m not anti-car. I own a car, use it regularly, park it on the street, and have driven in this city my entire life. I also happen to respect the safety and needs of other road user, and see many many drivers who simply do not. <br />The fact that you don&#039;t seem to distinguish the difference in damage potential between someone is a 3-4k lb steel box vs someone on a 30lb bicycle is very telling.

				All the more reason pedestrians and cyclists should obey traffic signals and the rules of the road. All of your statements here make it seem as if car drivers are always the guilty party when that is simply not the case. <br /><br />And I don&#039;t care for your tone or demeanor on here, so this is the end of my following of this thread. It&#039;s very telling that you know your arguments are thin.

The amount of times a pedestrian just wandered into the intersection against the light as I&#039;m coming to it consistently takes me aback. There&#039;s been a couple that have stared me down as they are doing it like they aren&#039;t the one doing something wrong. There&#039;s enough blame here to go all around for making mistakes whether intentional or not. I&#039;m hyper vigilant when I&#039;m driving, but there&#039;s not much I can do about people who don&#039;t also follow the rules or think they can just bend them if it seems safe to.
