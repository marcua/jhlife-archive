Outside of San Juan, there weren&#039;t too many people who spoke English. Almost anywhere along the northern coast is great. If you stay in San Juan, Condado has great beaches. Isabella (far west from San Juan along the northern coast) has probably some of the most pristine beaches on the island. Other fun places to visit: Boqueron, El Rincon, Ponce, El Yunque (rain forest), Arecibo (space radio telescope), and Guanica (Phosphorescent Bay), just to name a few. Vieques and the other island off the northeast coast are supposedly amazing, but I&#039;ve never been.

					Update from tonight&#039;s CB meeting:<br /><br />The meeting tonight was well attended (approximately 16 people if I&#039;m not mistaken, including Board members and Jim Wilson of NYSDOT). Mr. Wilson presented a new proposal to the Community Board which will encompass a larger parchment of land on the north side of 35th Avenue, effectively increasing the area by 4,000 Sq. ft. The new proposal included 5 &quot;play elements&quot; which was unanimously voted down to one in each park to allow more space for the dogs to actually run. It was also presented by Mr. Wilson that wood chips would be used to which someone (I didn&#039;t get the gentleman&#039;s name) brought up the fact that much research was done and that the pebbles/stones requested in the original proposal would be preferred, should the budget allow. We&#039;re still in the preliminary stages and this is by no means set in stone as of yet. There is definitely plenty of support for this from the community. We all should expect an e-mail from the Community Board sometime either tomorrow or early next week, including attachments of schematics and the fact sheet that was handed out at the meeting, as well as a projected date for the ground breaking of the new proposal. We&#039;ll be looking forward to the next CB#3 announcement regarding this project!<br /><br />Respectfully submitted<br /><br />

If you look at the reports given at the Community Board Meetings from the Police Dept., you&#039;ll see this to be the case. However, if you check out the crime statistics on the NYPD website: <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs115pct.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs115pct.pdf</a> you&#039;ll see that overall, crimes have gone down considerably over the last 19years. <br /><br />From personal experience, I have had several encounters with hispanic, machisto a-holes who will hurl homophobic epithets, while I was just minding my own business, trying to get home. Some of these encounters have actually happened in the early evening (6 or 7pm on Northern Blvd. and 37th/79th Street) and once around midnight on Roosevelt at 78th St. I usually just ignore them and continue on my way. So far, I&#039;ve been okay, but I&#039;m always worried that one day I will have to defend myself (one of the reasons I started carrying pepper spray.) I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a lot of it was hate-based, especially with the transsexual and gay community that&#039;s prevalent in JH. I hate to say it, but a majority of the offenders are young, Hispanic males (legal and illegal) who are perpetrating these type of crimes. This is mostly because JH is a mostly hispanic neighborhood and most of the bars on Roosevelt cater to them. <br /><br />As far as the economy relationship goes, any social scientist will tell you that the higher the unemployment, the higher the crime rate. It&#039;s not rocketscience, and people do shit where they eat all the time. Just because they&#039;re criminals, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re intelligent. If you&#039;re not documented and keep a low radar, how the hell are police going to track you down? <br /><br />It would be nice to see something of a Guardian Angels/neighborhood watch program started in JH. Perhaps it&#039;s something that can be brought up at the next Community Board meeting.

It&#039;s so disgusting! They recently cleaned it up - probably had to pay a hefty fine! What&#039;s even more disgusting is that twice this week, I&#039;ve seen pee in our lobby! I&#039;ve called the super twice on it and all they do is clean it up! They should try to survey who the culprit is and fine the owner or start eviction proceedings (although it could be a tenant). In a building of the same complex on the 78th Street side, we had a tenant who would crap in the lobby next to the elevator - absolutely wretched!
