				I noticed the listing on Craigslist and it mentions 900SF.&nbsp; When you consider its 900SF and has a terrace the $822 is not high priced at $179,000.&nbsp; Where can you get a 900SF apartment in a fine building for $179,000 in Jackson Heights with a Terrace?&nbsp; Plus factor in resident parking for $105 which is about $100 below market.&nbsp; This is very good value assuming the unit is not in poor condition.&nbsp; I lived at the Carlton House years ago and this is a quality post war building on a really nice Street opposite beautiful homes.&nbsp; One BR Sponsor Units are being sold at considerably higher prices ($100K+).&nbsp; Yes, they&#039;re renovated but that is still a big difference.&nbsp; I would be surprised if the Board allows this unit to be sold at $179,000 which is far below market.&nbsp;

				Either there was a typo in this ad or this place is a major dump and further it is quite odd that the BOD would allow a 900 sf unit in their building to go for so little this will be a negative for others in the building selling in the future.&nbsp; Having a comp that low can only hurt not help the building.&nbsp; ???<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4567.msg30207.html#msg30207">Quote from: Mike V on April 30, 2010, 06:46:51 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I noticed the listing on Craigslist and it mentions 900SF.&nbsp; When you consider its 900SF and has a terrace the $822 is not high priced at $179,000.&nbsp; Where can you get a 900SF apartment in a fine building for $179,000 in Jackson Heights with a Terrace?&nbsp; Plus factor in resident parking for $105 which is about $100 below market.&nbsp; This is very good value assuming the unit is not in poor condition.&nbsp; I lived at the Carlton House years ago and this is a quality post war building on a really nice Street opposite beautiful homes.&nbsp; One BR Sponsor Units are being sold at considerably higher prices ($100K+).&nbsp; Yes, they&#039;re renovated but that is still a big difference.&nbsp; I would be surprised if the Board allows this unit to be sold at $179,000 which is far below market.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				After I posted, I took a look at MPCPROPERTIES website that was selling the Sponsor apartments at the Carlton House.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any sponsor apartments listed (its possible they&#039;re now being rented as a result of the sluggish sales market) but I did see a resale one bedroom with terrace on the 6th floor for $289,000, $880 Maint (open house this Sunday 05/02 from 1 to 3PM).&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that&#039;s its the same line.&nbsp; What a difference in price.&nbsp; The price of $179,000 is listed on Craigslist and this site so I don&#039;t believe its a misprint.&nbsp;

				The place is far from being a dump. I am born and raised in Jackson Heights and I thought this would be a nice site to advertise on. I never expected such negativity. The apt was my Dad&#039;s and he recently passed away unexpectedly. I have discussed the price with the board. I have pictures on craigslist. I didn&#039;t post pictures here simply because I never advertised on this site before, wanted to wait and see if there was any interest. The building is very well maintained as Mike said and the reason I priced lower than others is because I need to settle the estate, not because it is a dump.<br />I will send pictures to anyone interested. I lived in Hawthorne where the maintenance was 225/mth. that building had no mortgage. I saw the top floor apt for 289,000 in the Carlton House no terrace totally renovated but maybe not to everyone&#039;s taste. I would much rather buy low and change whatever I want to my taste. I hope I was able to clear up any issues posted.

				You should raise the price. The low value is going to devalue all the other apartments in Jackson Heights. And when I want to sell my apartment, that will not be nice.
