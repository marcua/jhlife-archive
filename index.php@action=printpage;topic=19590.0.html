				There’s an outage — again. Been going on for over 2 hours. They’re supposedly working on it but this is so annoying and happens so often—this company is one of the crappiest service providers in the world. <br /><br />For those who have Verizon Fios, can you share how you got them? I’m called and written but they say it’s not available in my area (77th street). I know for a fact there are buildings on 76th that have FIOS.<br /><br />Thanks! <br />

				I used to have verizon but they used the old phone lines and told me to up grade to a faster speed.&nbsp; This did not resolve the issue and I went to Spectrum.&nbsp; If you live in an apartment building paid off by cable back in the 90&#039;s then you won&#039;t get FIOS- which btw is way overpriced.&nbsp; The whole communications business is&nbsp; a ripoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s like a legalized monopoly.

				I just wanted to share a tip with all the long-time Time Warner Cable customers out there. If, like me, your bills were approaching (or maybe even exceeding) $200 per month for the bundled service of cable+internet+phone, you can call Spectrum and ask to be switched to the Spectrum triple-play package and save yourself about $65 per month for the first year, and then about $20 per month when the introductory price expires. (There&#039;s a slight difference in the channels you receive, but I never really watched DIY or Logo anyway.) My bill just went from $187 to $124, and the internet speed is 30% faster, too.

				I have to admit the number of outages I&#039;ve had in the over 10 years I&#039;ve lived here have been pretty rare. I don&#039;t expect 100% uptime, it&#039;s just not realistic, but in my non-scientific estimation based on experience it&#039;s pretty solid. I&#039;ve seen much worse.<br /><br />We do have FIOS in the building now for around a year I think, I haven&#039;t jumped basically due to NY1. :)

				i&#039;ve had time-warner/spectrum for 19 years and it&#039;s been pretty great until the last couple of months. have had more outages in December 2019 than in the previous 200-plus months combined. guessing it&#039;s a bump in the road.

				that&#039;s really strange.literally had four within eight days. all starting in mid to late afternoon. each time, i called and was told &#039;there&#039;s no outage,&#039; then got a call back saying &#039;there&#039;s an outage.&#039; it&#039;s a hassle mostly because i work from home most days.

				I&#039;ve had fios for 3 years.&nbsp; Have not had a single outage, nor hiccup, nor slowdown in all that time.&nbsp; If you forgo all the extra junk (tv/phone) that they want to add on and only get an internet plan then the price of$50-60 is well worth it considering the speed and reliability.

				I second Chingwa&#039;s experience. In my last apartment we had Spectrum for internet only and it SUCKED. Not very fast and innumerable outages that took out that entire Brooklyn neighborhood.<br /><br />I can not speak to Fios&#039;s cable or land line service since I have never used it, but I give super high marks for their internet. If you require effective upload speeds like I occasionally do, Spectrum can&#039;t even touch Fios.

				Thanks for the feedback on Fios, everyone! <br /><br />Can anyone offer some background on how your buildings got Fios? Would really love to get that option in my complex. Many thanks!
