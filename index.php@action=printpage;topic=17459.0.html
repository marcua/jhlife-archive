				Has anyone shopped at Aldi?s&nbsp; I have a friend who swears by it, but on my one and only brief visit, I didn&#039;t see the hype.&nbsp; They have one over at the Rego Park Shopping Center by Queens Blvd.&nbsp; Can a comparison be formed to Trader Joe&#039;s?&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to their site:&nbsp; Aldi&#039;s (https://www.aldi.us/)

				Trader Joe&#039;s is owned by the Aldi&#039;s people - I find the stock very different - not as much organic as I&#039;d like, but I do go about once a month - they have some great deals and if you aren&#039;t too concerned about brand names or organic you can get some very good buys.&nbsp; Take your own bags unless you want to buy bags.&nbsp; There are some organic items and some brand name items, but they are not as health conscious as Trader Joe&#039;s.

				I was so underwhelmed the few times I&#039;ve been to an Aldi&#039;s in NY.&nbsp; The one I went to in FL was completely different and so much nicer. But it was in an affluent area, which I&#039;m sure had something to do with it.

				I will go way out of my way to go to a Trader Joes, but even if I&#039;m outside of the Aldi&#039;s store in Rego Park, I rarely go in. I feel like I&#039;m shopping in a 99 cent store when I go in there.

				to be fair, you ARE shopping in a 99 cent store -- or the food equivalent. sometimes you need that. i wouldn&#039;t make it my first, go-to choice, but i do like the chain.

I suspect if the store were in walking distance of my place, I would go there from time to time. It&#039;s just that when I&#039;m at the mall in Rego Park, I&#039;m usually thinking about other items like clothing from Century 21 and I don&#039;t want to be bothered by looking for food bargains to lug home with me.

				The Rego Park Aldi&#039;s is probably the worst one I&#039;ve ever been to.&nbsp; Was at one upstate and it was A LOT better.&nbsp; The only similarity was the sign on the door.&nbsp; Too bad really.&nbsp; Why do all the supermarkets in NYC suck?&nbsp; I guess we should be thankful, Jackson Heights actually has the best supermarkets of any neighborhood I&#039;ve lived in.. including &#039;hoods that are supposedly &#039;nicer&#039;<br />
