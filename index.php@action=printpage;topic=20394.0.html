				I think a safe &amp; relaxed way to keep 34th Ave open would be to keep the pedestrians on one side of the meridian and the bikes on the other side of the meridian. Everyone gets space, and walkers don&#039;t have to look over their shoulders for the bikes going &quot;5&quot; miles an hour. Any idea who is the best JH official to pitch this to? Thanks.

				My honest answer is I&#039;m not sure, but I did send some feedback about Open Streets to John O&#039;Neill. His office was running some info sessions about the program at the time, a few months ago.<br /><br />John O’Neill<br />Borough Planner<br />Office of The Queens Borough Commissioner | NYC Department of Transportation<br />120-55 Queens Boulevard, Room 285, Kew Gardens, NY 11424<br />joneill@dot.nyc.gov | 212.839.2510

				Hi Bell88,&nbsp; I&#039;m attaching the 34th ave survey link from the DOT, it was from Nov/ Dec, hopefully it&#039;s still active.<br />https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/34thAve<br /><br />I took part in the 1st listening session, &amp; that was discussed as an idea, <br />keeping one side, for bikers, scooters.
