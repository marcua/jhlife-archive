				Apparently the Garden School is trying to sell part of its yard:<br />http://www.loopnet.com/Listing/16714283/33-16-79th-Street-Jackson-Heights-NY/<br /><br />Does anybody know anything about this? &nbsp;If this lot were to be developed, it would be a huge lost opportunity for the neighborhood to expand its public open space.

				Lack of financing from the city does not appear to be the problem. &nbsp;NYC&#039;s 2011 capital budget has $4 million available for Travers Park expansion (secured by Danny Dromm), and the Borough President&#039;s office has promised an additional million. &nbsp;I&#039;ve also heard that the Community Board has written to the school asking them to sell it to the Parks Dept. &nbsp;So it appears that our various public officials are on top of this. &nbsp;Rather, the problem seems to be that the Garden School won&#039;t wait to give the city the time it needs to complete the purchase. &nbsp;<br /><br />Does anybody here know people close with the Garden School who might have a sense of what is going on here? &nbsp;If the city can purchase the property, it would be be a win-win for the school and the neighborhood by keeping this land as open space.

				What is this sudden rush on the part of the Garden School?&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t they much rather have a park next to the school than some (probably cheap and crappily built) new apartment building shoehorned into that spot?<br /><br />Bravo to Dromm and other leaders who are working on this.&nbsp; Let&#039;s make it happen!

				The Garden School, as far as I know, would be happy for the city to buy it. And from what I heard that was the incentive to put it up<br />for sale anyway. The school is fairly sound financially though they would love a more substantial building as this one has alot of additions tacked on to a smaller main building. As far as independent schools go, the tuition is relatively cheap. The next nearest similar school in Forest Hills is $5,000.more a year in tuition and Manhattan/Brooklyn indies are often $30,000.+. But more than that, the school wishes to be a good partner to the community and though I am not privy to the discussion, I think they are wanting the city to act on it and are<br />really trying to make it go that way. The playground across the street was revamped twice in last 8-10 years so there must be some<br />kind of funding somewhere. And my thinking is the Garden School would then use the Travers playground which is less used in the <br />day and the community would have something - community center?- in the play area of Garden School. I think the Playstreet closing may have forced the issue of use of available land in a good way for all. As far as I know, the idea of selling it straight to a developer is<br />not their intention at all. The two properties on 34th avenue across from IS230 are apparently owned by the city now and have not <br />been really worked on in a couple of years. I know they paid a hefty price there. One is leveled and one still has a home on it.

				Taggie,<br /><br />Either the property is for sale on the open market, or it isn&#039;t.&nbsp; The Garden School knows that the city needs time to purchase the land -- the money isn&#039;t even budgeted until 2011.&nbsp; If the school is negotiating in good faith with the city, it shouldn&#039;t simultaneously be offering the property up to developers.&nbsp; No private developer who buys that space would be using it for a community-oriented purpose.&nbsp; It sounds much more likely to me that the Garden School is trying to cash out quickly and we&#039;ll end up with another apartment building.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />But you sound knowledgeable about the situation.&nbsp; What gives you confidence that they are really taking the long view on this, and that the community is likely to end up with &quot;something&quot; in the Garden School play yard?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The sale of real estate to the city is not something I am knowledgeable about. My own experiences in private real estate<br />have taken much longer than anticipated, always. So if there are monies available in 2011 and it&#039;s the tail end of 2010,<br />it seems likely this will transact when the funds are freed up. Is there a way to put something on the market and hope <br />that the buyer you want is able to work it out perfectly- in this case the city? I don&#039;t know. But I think a good use of energy<br />now would be to say what is the best plan for this space community-wise and in detail to be able to come forward with those<br />plans soonest. I know that the Green Agenda folks have asked this question before and the answers were varied as to whose needs&nbsp; would be best met with community spaces. Parents of younger kids are often the best mobilized and connected politically but that<br />may or may not be the highest need and/or best use of precious space here in JH. I am by nature an optimist but also <br />have not heard or seen any indication of selling out on the part of the decision makers at Garden School. They have been <br />through thick and thin with 80+years in Jackson Heights and as far as I can see hope to make it continue well into the future.

Queens Borough President Helen Marshall is ready to kick in an additional $1 million.<br /><br />The price of the property is still under negotiation, said Mark Daly, a spokesman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. Even once that&#039;s settled, it could take up to two more years to go through the steps to acquire the property, he said.<br /><br />But the Garden School is in financial straits, said Marshall&#039;s spokesman Dan Andrews, and is looking to unload the land as soon as possible.<br /><br />&quot;The school ... is maybe looking to the open market to sell it quicker,&quot; he said. &quot;But we&#039;re still very hopeful we have a shot.&quot;<br /><br />Michael Rakosi, vice president of the 87-year-old school&#039;s board of trustees, said the nursery-through-12th-grade institution would prefer to sell the land to the city. This way it could remain an open space, he said.<br /><br />&quot;The question is do they have the money?&quot; Rakoski said. In the meantime, &quot;We&#039;re continuing to work with everybody.&quot;<br /><br />Local park advocates remain hopeful.<br /><br />Dudley Stewart, president of the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, would like to see the yard become an extension of Travers Park. The properties could be linked by turning a summer-only play street next to the park into a permanent pedestrian plaza, he said.<br /><br />&quot;This would be just wonderful for everybody,&quot; said Stewart, whose son learned to ride a bike on the play street.<br /><br />The community had fought to transform an empty stretch of 78th St., from Northern Blvd. to 34th Ave., into a neighborhood space where children could kick around soccer balls while seniors socialized. The play street was open every day from July 1 through Aug. 31 this year.<br /><br />One proposal that might sweeten the pot is a playground-sharing deal the city is looking into, a Parks Department official said. This would allow the school to use the land during the day and then open it up to the public once classes are over.<br /><br />But if all else fails, city officials said they haven&#039;t ruled out eminent domain. There has been talk in the community of acquiring the land housing a Toyota dealership that lies behind the park.<br /><br />Dromm said he hopes it doesn&#039;t have to come to that.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m hopeful that we&#039;ll be able to work this out,&quot; Dromm said of buying the Garden School yard. &quot;We have a lot of young families in the neighborhood that need park space for their children to be able to go play.&quot;<br /><br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/11/28/2010-11-28_buy_us_this_yard_citys_urged_to_get_lot_for_green_space_in_jackson_heights.html#ixzz16bEqK26X<br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/11/28/2010-11-28_buy_us_this_yard_citys_urged_to_get_lot_for_green_space_in_jackson_heights.html#ixzz16bEmQJNO

				IF the city does obtain it, does that mean there will be grass? Since they redid Traver&#039;s I feel creepy sitting there since I don&#039;t have a kid.<br /><br />Also, a pedestrian plaza where Play Street is sounds awesome.

				This sounds really promising. <br /><br />I would think it would be most beneficial to the school to have this space be a park if they have to sell it. Having the school surrounded on two sides by a park would be a great selling point for parents considering sending their children to the Garden School. Also, the name Garden School would remain fitting.<br /><br />I agree with Foxy, it would be good to have the new space be welcoming for adults that do not have children. I&#039;ve never hung out in Travers Park as it seems more of a place for children and teenagers.

				&nbsp;I know there is a category called plausible fiction but am not so sure about plausible reality. Maybe a scenario like this could happen.<br />Garden School could sell it&#039;s yard to a buyer with the stipulation that the school have x number of floors. The building is constructed<br />with sensitivity and green components. The city then gets the present school area and buys/relocates the businesses of Blockbuster <br />and Mandees and Toyota and Rainbowland nursery. The Travers park area extends two whole blocks on Northern Blvd. and the Nursery is turned in to a senior center/security facility. Much more green stuff is planted. New community center is commissioned by architects who know the area. Serious input is given by community members and it&#039;s all taken into consideration. Play Street becomes a permanent promenade. This park becomes the gem of Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp;And Garden School gets the school facility is has dreamed of for years and continues to be a wonderful partner in education in<br />Jackson Heights. Plausible reality?

				Hello all,<br /><br />There&#039;s one major obstacle to the Garden School athletic field becoming an extension of Travers Park: The Garden School needs to pay off two loans totalling $1 million during the next year. This info is not secret. <br /><br />The need to pay off these loans is making it difficult for the school to wait until city funds become available, hence the push by a few to try to sell the land. But that is not the whole story, various parties are exploring other alternatives, including obtaining a bridge loan to carry the school over until city funding becomes available. <br /><br />You can see the loan details by checking city records at <br /><br />http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/Scripts/DocSearch.dll/DocID<br /><br />1. Begin using ACRIS<br /><br />2. Search Property Records<br /><br />3. Document ID/City Register File Number<br /><br />4. Enter these numbers into the Document ID field. You need to go through the process twice to view each loan, each time plugging in a different document number. They are:<br /><br />2009092501024001 and 2009021100085001

				Who needs the bridge loan here? It sounds to me like the city needs it, not the school. Is that the right way to read this?<br />Are there other buyers ahead of the city? If not, the school deals with it&#039;s finances another way, right? Doesn&#039;t the city <br />have a way to expedite funds if there are competitive bids on real estate? This doesn&#039;t seem all that unusual in the <br />little I know of real estate transactions.

				Just to try and clear a few things up.<br /><br />As the Daily News article states and Len&#039;s post confirms, <br /><br />&quot;But the Garden School is in financial straits, said Marshall&#039;s spokesman Dan Andrews, and is looking to unload the land as soon as possible.&quot;<br /><br />Taggie, this is why the SCHOOL needs the bridge loan. If they don;t get money from a developer soon, they will go out of business. As you can see, the loans they took out are ridiculous and financially risky in an economy such as this. <br /><br />They need the money NOW if not sooner, and, in answer to other questions, the city has no process for getting them the money before the fiscal year begins in a few months. And there is the expected red tape of a city purchase as well. <br /><br />The beauty of a capitalist democracy is that the city has relatively little power (or zero) to make a private owner do anything as long as their actions don&#039;t violate local laws or zoning. The only thing we can do is the usual stuff -- put pressure on the Garden School, tell your elected officials that this is important, and if you have kids at the GS, vote with your feet -- tell them if they sell to a developer your kid will be going somewhere else. <br /><br />And by the way we can wait til hell freezes over for an annoucement from the school. That will come once they&#039;ve sold the land to a developer.

				Thank you, SixJ. As you note, the situation is urgent. The city does not have a lot of leverage. The property is zoned for a six-story building with one floor of commercial, so the land would be ready to go, depending on a developer&#039;s finances.<br /><br />What the city and others can do is to help the school secure a bridge loan until city money becomes available for the purchase. Government money takes time, hence the existence of an assortment of trusts and conservancies that put up initial money that enable these kinds of deals to take place. People are exploring that now, but the timetable may be too short for some of these groups, too.<br /><br />Anyone know a rich individual who would want to make the loan that could be written into an eventual purchase deal?

				There are some issues here that should be clarified. Is this school an important educational partner in the Jackson Heights<br />community? My answer is a resounding yes. Then should the community want to work with them and put pressure on the<br />city to meet the monetary need here. Yes. And I wish that there would be contacts listed as to who to call in government to<br />express our concern here. Does anyone know besides Danny Dromm who is involved from the city? Factually, the Garden <br />School has other options regarding this space and/or their loans but they would like the property to go to the city. <br />&nbsp;And here&#039;s the big but- does the city have the money now or in 12 months or in 5 years?&nbsp; Does the city have other options to<br />get the funding expedited like the previous poster is hoping. A bridge loan for the city. The school&#039;s options on the other hand<br />look a lot like our government right now. They are not ideal but there are contingency plans. The cheese has been moved.<br />&nbsp;One very important factor that should really be addressed is what to do with this &quot;open space.&quot; Open to who and open for <br />what. This is a KNOWN FACTOR in the negotiation and I have not heard or seen any publicity on what this space would become.<br />Another ball field, a wooded mini park, community gardens. What is your best guess? This is important as aspects of<br />the negotiation hinge on this and the school is being, in my opinion, extremely accommodating. They value the community<br />tremendously and want the best situation for all. But painting the school as the problem when the deal could be done <br />tomorrow(hypothetically) if the city had the money and could say what the open space would become is not an accurate<br />portrayal of this transaction.

				Taggie, sorry to have to call B.S. here, but it looks to me like you&#039;re trying to muddy the waters and divert heat away from the Garden School. <br /><br />The issues here seem pretty clear to me.&nbsp; From a community perspective, the Garden School is acting recklessly with a precious resource.&nbsp; They have the right to sell the land, but the community&#039;s interest is clearly not to sit back and let it happen.&nbsp; Prospective purchasers should be forewarned that they will be in for a significant fight every step of the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend that the community start by focusing on the subdivision that needs to take place for this sale to go through.&nbsp; Is this an as-of-right procedure?&nbsp; If not, I hope our elected officials are doing all they can to ensure that this subdivision is never approved.<br /><br />My nightmare scenario is that the Garden School sells the land to a developer to stay afloat, and then folds anyway in a few years.&nbsp; Is that scenario really all that implausible?&nbsp; Perhaps the Garden School should be thinking more creatively of ways to stay afloat as an institution without selling out on their students and the community.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Let&#039;s go to facts here in case of any confusion and/or muddy waters.<br />&nbsp;Fact 1. Garden School approached the city about the potential sale first!- before thinking of anyone else. Yes, we bat for the same<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;team. We are also &quot;the community&quot;. <br />&nbsp;Fact 2. Garden School is in Jackson Heights for 87 years now, through thick and thin. The Great Depression. Cocaine and gang wars.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are also &quot;the community&quot;. Many of us are on volunteer groups throughout the community and have been for decades.<br />&nbsp;Fact 3. Plans for the &quot;open space&quot; have not been coming forward from the city or any community group. This was a factor from the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;onset of negotiation. What is the projected use of the space and why delay if it needs to be answered?

				In the near term, if the Garden School has concerns about how the city would use the space, it can negotiate for them in the terms of sale (e.g. guarantees of day time access for Garden School students, city may not convert property to municipal parking lot, etc.). &nbsp;<br /><br />But it&#039;s a bit early for plans for the open space. &nbsp;The city doesn&#039;t own it yet, so who is in a position to formulate these plans? &nbsp;The Mayor&#039;s office? &nbsp;The Parks Department? &nbsp;The Community Board? &nbsp;Councilman Dromm&#039;s office? &nbsp; Each would no doubt have ideas for the site, but none can make a real plan and make it stick without a whole lot of process first. &nbsp;I think the community would be eager to discuss plans for the site, but it&#039;s just becoming aware of the situation. &nbsp;Plans will come later. <br /><br />If the Garden School wants to see plans as a prerequisite for sale to the city, would it make the same demand of any private purchasers? &nbsp;If not, why the double standard?<br /><br />I think the community has a deep well of respect and fondness for the Garden School.&nbsp; It&#039;s in everybody&#039;s interest for the Garden School to thrive.&nbsp; But I do stand by my initial concern.&nbsp; Putting this land for sale on the open market is reckless and endangers a scarce resource.&nbsp; And it&#039;s okay for the community to oppose this action even while acknowledging the Garden School&#039;s long history here.&nbsp;

				I have to agree with Queens Kid Although I am opposed to another monstrosity to be built- especially because I live right there, I do not own this property nor would I want someone telling me what to do with my property.&nbsp; I also think eminent domain is ridiculous.

				Just to clarify the situation of the Garden School and the effort to turn the athletic field into park space - as I understand it. I believe that neither Councilman Dromm&#039;s office nor other space advocates want to that jeopardize the existence of the Garden School. If the school has no other resources to pay off the loan coming due in January, it seems to face two choices, finding someone who is willing to buy the land, or find some sort of a bridge loan that will allow it to pay off its debt until the city is able to purchase the athletic field New York City park space. As I understand the situation, Councilman Dromm&#039;s office and other open space advocates, such as myself, hope the Garden School will remain open to the possibility of a bridge loan. No one is questioning the Garden School&#039;s right to use its property. <br /><br />The desire to see additional park space in Jackson Heights comes from the fact that the neighborthood is one of the most underserved in tghe ciyt when it comes to park space, and the need for additional park space was cited as the leading issue in approximately 15 outreach sessions conducted during the Green Agenda for Jackson Heights.<br />

				It&#039;s not a matter of deep breaths.&nbsp; The tone of some of these postings would be appropriate if this were public land and the City was selling it out from under the community.&nbsp; But this is not public land.&nbsp; The school is trying to survive yet some posters seem to be questioning their motives and integrity.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived here my whole life--55 years come tomorrow.&nbsp; We always lament the downfall of the mom and pop stores that were institutions in this neighborhood.&nbsp; I would hate to see a school which has served this community for decades suffer that same fate.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like to see them cast as villians just because they are trying to stay alive.&nbsp; Open space is a wonderful thing, but the advocates don&#039;t win any friends with this approach.

				Thank you Queenskid and Bellabella for your support of Gardens School&#039;s efforts to stay alive and thrive in Jackson Heights.<br />It&#039;s nice to know that there are voices of reason in this less than perfect situation for all of us. As for livelihoods, the school&#039;s<br />payroll has 78 people on it and these are jobs that are treasured by many of the staff. A number of them walk to work and<br />have given up larger paychecks for the quality experience that they have at Garden School. Yes, it&#039;s that good. The people<br />who work there, the teachers and staff, are beloved. They are kind, generous instructors and guardians of our children.<br />They wish as much as anyone for green space but the harsh realities of being an independent school in Queens where the monies do not flow into the coffers or endowment as easily as say a Manhattan school is that funds are tight now. The sale of the field is not anyone&#039;s first choice but if it ensures the present and future of this terrific school, like Queenskid said, so be it. To insure that<br />this school thrives, we should be encouraging people to see why there is so much passion about keeping this school going till<br />it&#039;s 100 year anniversary (in 13yrs) and beyond, here in lovely Jackson Heights. Come to an Open House if you&#039;re curious on<br />a Wednesday at 9:00. From the custodial staff to the cafeteria workers to the school nurse and the various teachers and <br />administrators, you will see how they work together to make the school a fine educational experience. <br />&nbsp;And fingers crossed for the city to get money soonest...<br /><br />PS- Happy Birthday Queenskid and am glad you stayed put. Cheers to many more for you!

Photo by Rebecca Henely</em><br /><br />City officials have raised much of the money to purchase a concrete yard next to a Jackson Heights private school for a park, but the school may decide it needs the money now and look elsewhere.<br /><br />â€œRight now weâ€™re in a race against the clock about them opening up the sale to a possible developer vs. going through the process of the city,â€ said City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights).<br /><br />Drommâ€™s office has secured $4 million and Borough President Helen Marshall has $1 million to buy land from the Garden School, a private institution at 33-16 79th St. in Jackson Heights. The Garden School is selling the yard for $5.75 million.<br /><br />â€œThe idea is that we can then extend Travers Park,â€ Dromm said, referring to the 2-acre park on 34th Avenue between 78th and 79th streets, across the street from the Garden School.<br /><br />Officials from the Garden School did not respond to calls for comment.<br /><br />Dromm said he had been working with the Garden Schoolâ€™s board and headmaster, Dr. Richard Marotta, to purchase the land and had been dealing with the city Department of Parks and the city Department of Design and Construction to speed the process along.<br /><br />But Dromm said school officials had told him the school is in financial straits and needs to sell the land soon.<br /><br />â€œThey did not inform us of the immediacy,â€ Dromm said.<br /><br />The councilman said he believes selling the land to the city would be best for both the people of Jackson Heights â€” an area which has the second smallest amount of park space in the city â€” and the school, whose students would still have use of the park during school hours. He said selling it for development would also decrease the value of the school not only financially, but would be a detriment to the students.<br /><br />â€œThe Garden School is a valuable asset to Jackson Heights,â€ Dromm said.<br /><br />The councilman said he was also unsure whether selling to a developer would get money for the school more quickly. He said the city was about a month into the seven-to-eight month process of buying the land.<br /><br />Ed Westley of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group said he was surprised by the schoolâ€™s rush to sell the land since he had thought the talks between the city and school were going well.<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Councilman Dromm raises a good point about the likelihood of a faster payment from the city than from a private developer. Developers typically pay for the land only after a series of approvals are in hand, something that could take 18 months. Otherwise they could turn out to own a lot of land that has no use for them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We should all wish him luck in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement on the sale of the land to the city. Jackson Heights will not get another similar opportunity.

				I want to clear up something that has been confusing. The City has the money right now. The monies were allocated as of July 1st, 2010 in the City Council Capital budget. <br /><br />However, any time the City purchases land it has to go through a process known as ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure). ULURP is an established and mandated time frame within which application review must take place to allow for the public to understand and respond the proposed land use change. It takes a minimum of 6 months to complete. It usually includes an environmental review, Community Board hearings, and City Council hearings. To read more about ULURP,&nbsp; &nbsp;http://tinyurl.com/ulurp &nbsp;(http://tinyurl.com/ulurp)<br /><br />The money is there now -- it is the ULURP process that requires additional time. But so does selling to a developer. If the Garden School sells the land to a developer, the developer must wait 6 months for the tax lot subdivision.

				Meetings on this sale have been going on since April with city officials as I understand, and I think, some people from the JH green<br />group. That&#039;s 8 months ago and if the money from the city is already here, as had been the rumor for awhile now, what is the<br />hold up on behalf of the city getting this study underway? Is there anyone to contact in city government to help things along?<br />I seem to remember things moved swiftly with the city when the renovated Tweed courthouse was shifted from the Museum of <br />the City of New York to Mayor Bloomberg for the Dept of Ed. use.<br />

				Hi Everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. <br /><br />The dis-information on this thread is what has insprired me to finally jump in to the conversation. <br /><br />Taggie - The Tweed Courthouse was an existing property owned by the City of New York. The transfer of ownership was from one city agency to another. There was no sale of privately owned land for public use as is the case with the Garden School yard. <br /><br />If the city has been slower in its process than usual for these things, perhaps it&#039;s becasue there&#039;s some doubts that the Garden School&#039;s true intention was to sell the land to the city in the first place. If they were in negotiations with the city why did they post the land for sale publicly? Why should the city invest time and resources in to a sale that looks as if it won&#039;t go through? <br /><br />Our city doesn&#039;t always do things right, but in this instance, it appears to me they are not the ones fouling up this deal and ultimately our neighborhood.

				&nbsp;To the previous poster, not to get to far off track but of course, the Tweed deal was city to city. Of course. I hoped that it was<br />inferred that the red tape in converting a courthouse to a museum and to a school facility was at a fast pace as opposed to this process. The surveys and such that seem to be holding up the city&#039;s ability to go forward here might be subject to staffs with<br />budget cuts and so forth. Who knows? I think you may also have missed the post where I stated that the school did go to the city<br />first and ultimately really wishes it to happen this way. But as also been posted, a long time institution with so much fondness in the neighborhood, Garden needs to keep the school going with appropriation of assets it owns and that are private property. Other <br />private schools in the neighborhood like McClancey H.S and Lexington School for the Deaf also have athletic fields (much bigger and <br />with grass!) and they may one day parcel off to tighten their belts as well. But I hope not. It&#039;s tough times all over.<br />&nbsp;Do you have any experience with waiting on the city to close real estate deals? I have none and am only wondering how long this usually takes? What do you know that makes you think this won&#039;t happen? I feel that it&#039;s very likely. Am also wondering why the news is so recent on this site that the city has had this money since July 1st. Why was this info not more public on this topic?

				Right you are Taggie, why don&#039;t we look at other open space in the neighborhood. Like the Queens Savings bank on Northern and 77th street, they have an awfully big parking lot. And also, I realized I never see more than a few cars in that parking lot. It&#039;s like wasted space. Why can they sell that land real cheap to the Parks Dept so the neighborhood can use it as green space. It&#039;s right across the street from Travers park. We can put some benches there and there some extra space for the community. Better yet they can donate the space. And what about all those beautiful gardens in the landmarked coop buildings why don&#039;t they open those of for community use. Why should Garden school be the only one being harrassed.

				The people who live in the coops have paid a lot of money, monies they have <strong>earned</strong>, to have the privilege to enjoy their green space as a quiet refuge. Yes, this is a privilege. Why should they open it?<br /><br />The bank does have open space, but has anyone approached them?<br /><br />Garden School has made a well thought out decision to offer this land for sale. Yes, they seem to need the money, but why bring in other areas of the neighborhood as potential areas for green space? <br /><br />The focus is here, on the potential sale of the lot at 33-16 79th St. Not any others.<br /><br />

				Will Sweeney -thanks for posting the timeline for the ULURP. &quot;It takes a minimum of 6 months to complete. It usually includes an environmental review, Community Board hearings, and City Council hearings. To read more about ULURP,&nbsp; &nbsp;http://tinyurl.com/ulurp &quot;<br /><br />Has the advertising begun for the Community Meetings? If we are into the process at items #1 or 2 and this is #3, shouldn&#039;t we<br />start talking about what &quot;open space&quot; is for the Jackson Heights community? It seems like this could take time.<br /><br />My own preference would be to let the over 10 years old crowd have something. Not an adult playground per se but a track <br />with the comfortable cushiony stuff and grass or turf in the middle. This could be for games or a parcourse of exercise <br />equipment or just open. Astoria&#039;s track is heavily used, has a lot of rules but is in good condition. McCarren Park in Brooklyn has a track which is also heavily used- runners, ladies in heels, bikers, etc- but it is kind of crusty. Astoria also has good bathrooms and a<br />security area right there so they really enforce safety. Families could also use this as group exercise but it would not be primarily<br />a play area like across the street. Any thoughts?

				&nbsp;Rumor has it that even though the city might take 6 to 18 months to be able to complete the deal, Garden School is in the process<br />of securing funds to make this happen. Thanks to the school, the government officials involved and community leaders (and anyone<br />else who stepped up) for setting an example of being caring neighbors. This land should add nicely to Travers Park and make Play<br />Street more viable long-term.<br />&nbsp;Fingers crossed that any future hurdles that might come are crossed successfully.

				This makes me sick to my stomach.&nbsp; We are so starved for park space and yet they&#039;re going to shoehorn in an apartment building on the last available lot. &gt;:(<br /><br />Since some people want to look at it in only economic terms, I think it&#039;s clear that the lack of park space will hurt property values in the area.

				Hello everyone. Go to Google Maps and enter the address of the Garden City School. Look at the entire block in satellite view and those adjacent to it... Travers Park and the Joseph Pulitzer School. If you really want to expand the neighborhood&#039;s park and green space for our kids and families, how about making an offer to the owner(s) of the commercial properties on Northern Boulevard? (Hell, forget making them a fair offer and claim eminent domain!) If you got rid of the Toyota dealership, Blockbuster (soon to be out-of-business anyway) and Mandees, you could expand Travers Park to the entire block, move the children&#039;s playground across the street and even include the intermediate school&#039;s running track as part of a three block park-and-recreation space. Yes, this proposal would be far more expensive than the Garden School alternative and require a lot more planning, but it would also go much, much further towards making a truly useful green space for the community.

				StevenGrey, I totally agree that Toyota, Blockbuster, etc. should become park land.&nbsp; I also want the Garden School lot.<br /><br />We could expand Travers Park to include both, and we would still be the worst neighborhood (or close to it) when it comes to public park space in NYC.

				There was an extraordinary meeting tonight at the Community Church. &nbsp;Some 150+ people showed up in the thick of a blizzard to address this community crisis. &nbsp;We heard from the leaders of Jackson Heights Beautification Group and Jackson Heights Green Alliance, Councilmember Dromm, Assemblymember DenDekker, and the headmaster and board chair of the Garden School. &nbsp;Our community leaders, especially Councilmember Dromm and his staff, have been working hard and creatively to find a solution, but the situation remains bleak. &nbsp;The Garden School representatives gave us minimal cause for optimism that something can be worked out: simply that since a deal has not yet been signed, there is still a window of opportunity open.&nbsp; A last-ditch plan to organize bridge financing for the school is in the works.&nbsp; Watch this space for details that should be forthcoming soon.<br /><br />Despite strong emotions and high stakes surrounding this discussion, it was an amazingly substantive, civil, and constructive meeting. &nbsp;To echo something that I heard someone else say at tonight&#039;s meeting, tonight made me proud to be part of this community.<br /><br />P.S. It became clear in the meeting that a lot of the information in the Daily News article is false or misleading. &nbsp;Comparing apples to apples, the city&#039;s offer works out to be a lot more generous than the developer&#039;s offer. &nbsp;But the developer is offering money upfront that the city does not have the freedom to provide. &nbsp;

				The saddest part about this, is that if a six-story apartment building goes up on that lot, not only does Jackson Heights lose, the Garden School students and families lose as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s a short-sighted solution to a long-term problem. Maybe if we can&#039;t get the space for Travers Park, we can get a developer who would consider setting aside space for for a YMCA or a Boys &amp; Girls club, so at least we might get some desperately needed community/recreation space.

				<strong>Will you help to buy a park for Jackson Heights?</strong><br /><br />Thanks to everyone who came out last night for the Emergency Community Meeting about the Garden School athletic field. Despite the snow, 150+ people showed up to hear more about the situation and brainstorm ideas for a solution. <br /><br /><strong>Following is a summary of the situation:</strong><br /><br />- Council Member Daniel Dromm has secured $5 million in capital funds for the City Parks Department to purchase the Garden School athletic field and turn it into an extension of Travers Park.<br /><br />- While the Garden School would prefer to sell the lot to the city, their Board of Directors has voted to sell to a developer to address their immediate cash flow needs of $500,000 in the next few months. The money from the developer would be available more quickly than the money from the City because the City must go through ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure). This is the process that allows for public review and environmental study of any purchase of land by the City. ULURP typically takes 12-18 months to complete. The money can not be released until ULURP is completed.<br /><br />- <strong>We want the Garden School to accept the city&#039;s offer</strong>, so the attendees at the meeting have proposed that the community lend the money to the Garden School to address their immediate cash flow needs.&nbsp; This would basically be an interest-free loan to be repaid in the next 12-18 months, upon completion of the city&#039;s land use review process. Once the Garden School receives the money from the city, the money will immediately be repaid.<br /><br />We at the Jackson Heights Green Alliance are reaching out to the community to ask if you would pledge money to this cause.&nbsp; For amounts of $500 and above, this would be a LOAN to be repaid by the Garden School within two years when the purchase by the City is completed.&nbsp; Amounts under $500 would be a donation and would be reserved for Parks-related improvements.<br /><br />We are in the process of working with an attorney to draft a contract that will establish the terms of the loans from Jackson Heights residents to the Garden School.<br /><br />If you are willing to help save one of the last remaining open spaces in the neighborhood for the expansion of Travers Park, please email me at dudley@... with your name, email, phone, and the amount you&#039;d be willing to pledge. Once we have worked out the details of where the money will be held we will then request you to honor your pledge.<br /><br /><strong>Let&#039;s do everything we can to preserve the open space we so desperately need!</strong><br /><br />Get Involved,<br /><br />Dudley Stewart<br />Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br />dudley@jhgreen.org

				I&#039;m really thankful for the efforts of the JH Green Alliance and of all the folks who hashed out this agreement last night-- in the middle of a blizzard, no less. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br /><br />That being said... essentially, what is being proposed here--$500,000 in interest-free loans-- is a mini-bailout for the Garden School. This would come from the pockets of local families, and those who do not have the wherewithal to contribute more than $500 would not see their money paid back at all.<br /><br />It would be an extraordinary act of generosity on the part of this community. But <strong>has anyone discussed how the Garden School got into debt in the first place</strong>? Did their taxes suddenly go up? Did enrollment go down? Was there a failed investment, mismanagement or outright embezzlement? I think if we are to consider handing over our hard-earned money to the school, we have a right to know.

				These questions were discussed openly at the meeting last night, although of course there&#039;s no way to know whether the school is being completely honest with us.&nbsp; The school went into a lengthy discussion of some aspects of their finances.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t follow all of it, but in essence, enrollment fell sharply as the recession hit, and they have taken out some expensive loans to cover their deficit.&nbsp; Whether other strategies to keep their budget in balance would have been more advisable is a good question, but not one we really have enough information to debate productively.<br /><br />The immediate problem for the community is that the school has found a solution that works -- they will accept a developer&#039;s offer to purchase their schoolyard and the school&#039;s excess development rights.&nbsp; So this fundraising appeal is not a bailout for the school -- it&#039;s a rescue effort for the community&#039;s aspirations to gain better park space.

				The cynical New Yorker in me is inclined to ask what happens should the school close its doors and declare bankruptcy before this 12-18 month process is completed? <br /><br />At the very least, if we are going to be asked to accept some financial risk, their agreement with their new neighborhood creditors should include first lien on ALL of their property, otherwise not only do we end up losing our loan money but we will also see one of the school&#039;s other creditors selling the property to a developer.<br /><br />

				The situation is unfortunately really quite awful. I appreciate the Alliance&#039;s and Danny Dromm&#039;s to save the situation. <br /><br />I&#039;d consider lending the GS money though I probably can&#039;t do much more than $500 and I imagine that many people here are in the same situation. That would still mean that 1000 people will have to chip in. Dudley, do you think this is a realistic goal? What happens if we don&#039;t reach that target of 500K? Is that a set sum? How would it play out in terms of the GS&#039;s cash flow operations over time? Do you think we have a realistic chance of getting this done?<br /><br />Would it be a good idea to reach out to local businesses? A free-interest loan would hardly be appealing to 99 cents stores but maybe the gazillions of banks might at least consider it? <br /><br /><br />

The city wasn&#039;t offered the opportunity to make a counterbid.<br /><br />According to local City Council Member Daniel Dromm, who was facilitating sale talks with the city, the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation made an offer of $4.7 million for 20,000 square feet of land or $4.8 million for the entire field, with a clause allowing the Garden School to use the property during school hours.<br /><br />At an emergency community meeting Wednesday night attended by about 150 residents, school officials said they wanted to work with the city but they were facing financial pressures to move quickly.<br /><br />&quot;Our first choice has always been a deal with the city with a park, but we don&#039;t want to put the Garden School at risk,&quot; said Arthur Gruen, president of the school&#039;s board of trustees.<br /><br />Mr. Gruen said the school had received a bid of $5.4 million for a plan to build apartments on the field. He didn&#039;t identify the bidder, but said there was no deal yet. Other developers are also interested, he said.<br /><br />Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s trustees, said a recession-driven decrease in enrollment was one reason the school was in need of cash to cover operating costs and stay afloat. &quot;Our students are children of working class families, not from families with unlimited money,&quot; he said.<br /><br />In addition, Mr. Rakosi said &quot;it can take a long time to get that money from the city&quot; in land deals. The process of acquiring the field could take as long as two years, according to Philip Abramson, a parks department spokesman.<br /><br />But Mr. Dromm&#039;s office calls that time estimate pessimistic and said there are volunteers who are willing to speed up the process.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t know if the parents are going to tolerate having a four- to six-story building in their school yard and put up with construction and a shrunken school yard,&quot; Mr. Dromm said.<br /><br />In a city district that ranks among the lowest in park space per resident, the idea has angered many residents, many of whom see this as a scarce opportunity to increase green space in the area.<br /><br />&quot;We cannot afford to have another apartment building getting rid of some of the last park space left in this area,&quot; said Dudley Stewart, president of Jackson Heights Green Alliance.<br /><br />Parents of some students at the Garden School also object to the loss of the property to developers.<br /><br />&quot;There is no way I&#039;ll continue paying that kind of money to a private school that doesn&#039;t provide something so basicâ€”a school yard,&quot; said Susan Collins, whose 9-year-old daughter has been attending the school for two years.<br /><br />Others were surprised to learn about the potential sale of the field. &quot;I had no idea this was going on,&quot; said Martha Rodriguez, whose granddaughter attends the Garden School. &quot;I grew up here and for the school to not care about the community&#039;s needs is unacceptable,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Because the athletic field is situated just across from Travers Park, 78th Street is closed off and used as additional play space for kids during the summer. The acquisition of the athletic field would have allowed the creation of a much larger contiguous public space, backers say.<br /><br />The Garden School has class sizes of 10 to 12 students and subsidizes the cost of tuition by as much as $600,000 annually so needy students can attend, said Richard Marotta, headmaster of Garden School.<br /><br />The Wednesday meeting concluded with community members saying they would approach banks and foundations in an attempt to forestall an immediate sale of the property.<br /><br />&quot;The city has the money and it&#039;s just a matter of finding the money to cover the school&#039;s expenses in the short term,&quot; said Mr. Stewart.

				Dromm, Dudley and the parents quoted in this article point correctly to the fact that by selling the land to developers, the GS will effectively aggravate its own situation. It is predictable that some parents will consider alternatives, and of course the standing of the GS in the community will be seriously damaged, even more so now when there is an understandable resistance to developments -- huge, cheaply-made and inconsiderate (see discussion on 84th street and 37th Ave) -- in the neighborhood. That&#039;s an additional cost the GS must consider if they go the developer route. <br /><br />@willsweeney: nice photo!

				Why not consider a fundraiser/dinner maybe asking St. Mark&#039;s to donate the use of their community room.&nbsp; Many of the restaurants and business&#039; in the area could donate dinners and items for a raffle.&nbsp; An RSVP of let&#039;s say $150.00 per person.&nbsp; Just an idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				This is a fundraiser (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5554.msg37475#msg37475). &nbsp;If you can donate funds, your donation will be gratefully accepted. &nbsp;If you have more than $500 that you can make available in the form of a loan, that will be gratefully accepted as well. &nbsp;But right now, until they can get an account and appropriate legal structure set up, they&#039;re asking people to make pledges so they have an idea of whether this plan is even feasible.<br /><br />Either way, we need to raise $500k ASAP. &nbsp;That&#039;s a lot of money, and there is a very small number of people working very hard on this. &nbsp;If you&#039;re able to help in any way, please let Dudley know.

				I&#039;m willing to pledge 500+ but its VERY congingent on whatever documents they draw up being agreeable... I&#039;m hesitant to make a promise until I know specifics on how they are going to structure this - providing that information publicly far and wide might open more checkbooks <br /><br />Also, I assume that people that don&#039;t have the 500 individually could potentially pool resources to meet the minimum... Just a suggestion if you have neighbors you can trust &lt;grin&gt;. If you start making formal investing entities then its not worth it but if you know 2 people that want their 250 back you could make this work I imagine

				Has anyone given any consideration to starting a online site for securing donations/loans?<br /><br />I think there are a lot of sites where you can create a page and then make it easy for people to donate funds easily and securely.&nbsp; Also, you can see a running total of funds raised to get people excited and then also have a link that can be easily forwarded to people (even those outside of JH) who might want to assist.

				Dudley is working on creating a website that will track donations.&nbsp; He looked into kickstarter.com, but they take a 6% fee of all money raised which is pretty hefty, considering the amount being raised.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the meeting, it was discussed that an account would be created (possibly by JHBG) where the funds would be held until enough was raised, approximately $500,000.&nbsp; Once the money is raised, it will be offered to Garden School, who will be asked to sign a letter stating that they will sell the land to the city.&nbsp; No money would be released to them without an assurance that they won&#039;t sell to a developer.&nbsp; If Garden School won&#039;t agree to sell the land to the city, the money would be returned to the contributors.<br /><br />Whether or not $500K is enough is up for debate.&nbsp; That amount will get them through June, 2011.&nbsp; What they will need for next school year is anybody&#039;s guess.&nbsp; It will all depend upon how quickly the ULURP process goes.&nbsp; If Garden School can get a signed contract by next December and enrollment doesn&#039;t drop any further, they could probably get a bridge loan to cover any deficit they might have for school year 2011-2012 until the sale goes through.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure more details will be released as they become available.&nbsp; Until this meeting it seemed everyone involved was convinced that a sale to a developer was imminent.&nbsp; It still may be, but Garden School gave the audience the impression that the land was still for sale until a contract was signed.

				Here&#039;s a quick update:<br /><br />We have raised over $100,000 in pledges so far! The response has been amazing. <br /><br />You will be hearing from us as soon as we have worked out the details of the contract between people who have offered to lend/donate money and the fund that will hold the money for the community.<br /><br />We are working with lawyers on a contract regarding the terms of this loan from the community to the Garden School. We will not release this money to the Garden School until we have a satisfactory legally&nbsp; binding document.<br /><br />Our goal is to obtain a contract explicitly stating:<br /><br />a) That they will pursue the city&#039;s offer exclusively<br />b) That the first action they will take with the city&#039;s money when they receive it is to return this money to the fund so it can be redistributed back to the community.<br /><br />We will be posting regular updates about this campaign on www.growapark.org (coming very soon!), facebook (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=50572593804&amp;v=info) and twitter (@JHGreenAlliance).

				Great job with the rally here! Thanks again to Garden School as we come up to the one year anniversary when they approached<br />the city about the sale to begin the whole thing! Now let&#039;s see if the fire lit under the city can propel things at a somewhat faster<br />speed to get all the necessary steps completed before another year goes by. Does anyone know where in the ULURP process we are now? <br /><br />&nbsp;Two thoughts regarding this <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Could the names be collected so that a bigger group can be formed for Jackson Heights volunteers in all things green? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the past, momentum has been big upfront and then dwindled when it comes to other less publicized projects like cleanups or<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;working Playstreet on a hot August afternoon where participation is often sparse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; Is there a working definition of &quot;open space&quot; long term?

				Hey Taggie, I&#039;m a bit confused... I thought the Garden School was deep in debt. How did the organization come up with $70,000 to put into its own &#039;bridge loan&#039; fund? Or was that money donated by parents and alums?

				Please do some thoughtful reading of the information provided with regards to the &#039;Board&#039; raising $70+K for the bridge loan.<br /><br />A board of trustees is a group of hard working individuals who, in addition to full-time jobs, spend countless hours trying to make decisions to benefit the school.

				There continues to be a lot of dis-information on this topic, and I can&#039;t quite tell where it&#039;s coming from. <br /><br />I attended the community meeting the other night where it was disclosed, that only about 6% of the students at the school come from Jackson Heights, the rest are from various parts of Queens. So we&#039;re talking about maybe 12 to 15 students form the immediate area, based on an enrollment of about 240. Which means Jackson Heights Children are in a significant minority.&nbsp; So, how can the innocent act of exercising one&#039;s first amendment rights be harming the &quot;children of Jackson Heights&quot;? <br /><br />It was also disclosed at that same public meeting that the parents of the students who attend the school were not adequately informed about what was going on with the board&#039;s decision to reject the city&#039;s offer. Based on the fact that the overwhelming majority of families with children in the school are NOT from the immediate area, it seems only fitting to me that the community should inform these parents about the consequences of the board&#039;s choices. <br /><br />Further, if there really were people blocking the entrance to the school or otherwise creating an obstruction, were the police called? Clearly if the children were being terrorized the responsible action would have been to inform the authorities. If not, then we have to assume the &quot;threat&quot; was minimal if it existed at all. Waiting an entire day to raise the concern without any real evidence on a local blog hardly seems like a responsible action to me. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of spin here and what seems like an attempt to not vilify the school. While they may not be in position to wait for the city process to be complete they should be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. <br /><br />There is a groundswell of support to make the deal with the city come to fruition. The community is willing to wok with the school, but from the negative comments and spin coming out form some people it&#039;s not so clear to me that the school is really willing to work with the community. <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame because I really was considering sending my child to the Garden School when the time comes, but this whole experience has put a bad taste in my mouth.

Their goal is to raise $500,000 as soon as possible.<br /><br />&quot;We have a lot of people in the community who love parks and are committed to preserving open space,&quot; said City Councilman Daniel Dromm. &quot;For the advocates in the community to have collected such a large amount of money in bad economic times is incredible.&quot;<br /><br />School officials seemed open to accepting a community loan at a meeting last week attended by nearly 150 neighborhood residents, said Dromm (D-Jackson Heights). But no one from the nursery-through-12th-grade school promised the land would go to the city - even if residents raise enough money to cover the school&#039;s operating costs.<br /><br />Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s board of trustees, has said the school would prefer to sell the yard to the city to expand nearby Travers Park.<br /><br />But Garden School is in tough financial straits due to an enrollment drop. And it could take up to two years for the school to get a dime from the city due to its lengthy acquisition process.<br /><br />&quot;The community is making us into the bad guy when the city has not put up one nickel in licensing or guaranteeing that they are going to purchase the property,&quot; Rakosi said.<br /><br />The trustees rejected a $4.7 million city offer last month to buy 20,000 square feet of property. It also shot down a $4.8 million bid for 29,000 square feet that would have allowed Garden to use the yard during the school day.<br /><br />The school is now &quot;close&quot; to signing a deal with a developer for &quot;substantially&quot; more money, Rakosi said, but the trustees are still &quot;talking&quot; to the city.<br /><br />&quot;I didn&#039;t ask [the community] to raise half a million dollars,&quot; Rakosi said.<br /><br />The issue has become heated because Jackson Heights has one of the least amounts of park space per capita in the city, according to New Yorkers for Parks.<br /><br />Dudley Stewart, president of the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, which is spearheading the pledge drive, hopes the community&#039;s efforts will sway the trustees.<br /><br />But &quot;we will not ask people to honor their pledges until we&#039;re certain the school accepts the city&#039;s offer,&quot; Stewart said.<br /><br />Jacqueline Quinn, 46, of Astoria said she would consider pulling her two children out of the school if Garden sells its yard to anyone but the city. She said she hopes students can use the field during school hours.<br /><br />&quot;If the school was willing to work more with the community, I think it would build a bridge for the future success of the school,&quot; she said.

Held at the Community United Methodist Church, the meeting was attended by representatives from local organizations, elected officials and nearly 80 Jackson Heights residents, most of whom were previously unaware of the proposed sale. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Garden School, an 87-year-old institution with classes from kindergarten to 12th grade, is reeling under the effects of the recession and a drop in enrollment. In March 2010, the school began talks with the city regarding the sale of its 29,000-square foot-playground at the corner of 34th Avenue and 78th Street. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The city, hoping to expand Travers Park, situated across the street from the playground, made two offers: $4.7 million for 20,000 square feet and $4.8 million for 29,000 square feet, the latter coupled with a clause allowing Garden School to continue using the playground during school hours. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œIt was an extremely generous offer, very close to the asking price of $5.2 million,â€ said Councilman Danny Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), who was involved in the negotiations and secured most of the funds for the purchase. â€œThe important thing was that the school could sell the property and continue to use it, so that the kids wouldnâ€™t lose their playground.â€ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At a Jan. 18 board meeting, trustees of the school voted to decline the cityâ€™s offer. They are considering a private developerâ€™s offer of $5.4 million for 20,000 square feet, said Gruen, a deal which would allow the school to retain one third of the property as its playground. The main reason for rejecting the cityâ€™s offer, he said, was that it would take too long to close the deal. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When buying property, the city must follow the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure or ULURP. For land deals, this process, which typically takes 12 to 18 months, starts with an application to the Department of City Planning followed by multiple certifications and reviews by city bodies including the community board, borough president and city Planning Commission. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œSo the question is, how do we get from here to there?â€ Gruen said at the meeting, estimating that the school was in immediate need of $500,000 to cover operating costs and remain open for the next academic year. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Both Garden School and Dromm said that they have, individually and together, made several attempts to arrange for a bridge loan, approaching private investors and the schoolâ€™s wealthy alumni and banks such as JP Morgan Chase,to help the school survive till the cityâ€™s check clears. But none of the negotiations have been successful, said Richard Marotta, principal of the school, attributing their failure to obtain a loan to high interest rates, ranging from 10 to 13 percent, and the absence of an executing contract with the city. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œThe fact is that the deal with the city adds many expenses. We have to extend our existing loans for another year or more, pay debt service costs and take a new bridge loan at a high rate of interest,â€ said Gruen. Another problem, he added, is that the deal is contingent upon whether the city has funds at the time that the ULURP process is completed 12 to 18 months later. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Community organizations, such as the Jackson Heights Beautification Group and the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, who have been in touch with the school since December of last year, say green space must be a priority in the neighborhood. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œJackson Heights and our community district is next to last in the city in the amount of green space we have,â€ said Edwin Westley, president of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. â€œThis is a rare opportunity to expand our green footprint.â€ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This sentiment seemed to resonate with residents at the meeting who voiced their opposition to a playground being turned into a construction site and then to a big apartment building. The area is zoned as R-7, which would allow for the construction of a seven or eight storey residential building. The school is also considering selling its air rights to developers, which would allow construction of an even taller building. The community also expressed concern about the fate of Jackson Heightsâ€™ Play Street, a space on 78th Street between Travers Park and Garden Schoolâ€™s playground, to be closed to traffic in July and August, giving children more open space to play during the summer. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In an attempt to salvage the situation, residents at the meeting made several suggestions, including: an appeal for federal funds, a wide-scale neighborhood fundraiser themed â€œDo you want to buy a park?â€ an interest-free community-based loan program and an initiative to persuade banks in the neighborhood to give back by providing funding. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œThere is a lot of energy here. Many people found out about this problem only today and really want to do something,â€ said James Cornejo, 42, who has lived in Jackson Heights all his life and has two children who use Travers Park regularly. â€œI want to request the school to work with the city and the community so that our children can have more open space and a better future.â€ <br />(http://images.zwire.com/local/Z/Zwire2731/zwire/images/Front020311W_I508.jpg)<br /><br />

				A lot of the negative comments particularly regarding Dr. Marotta feel very personal and agenda-driven and don&#039;t seem to have any constructive purpose.&nbsp; As a parent at Garden School I and many others that I speak to would like park space as much as everyone else. But the true gem of Garden School is not its land...there is other land that could be park space in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The true gem is what happens in Garden School and the love and caring and learning that takes place there every day and night as it&#039;s a second home to all its students and to us parents too.&nbsp; Parents may have strong opinions about whether the yard goes to a developer or not but ask any kid who goes to Garden how they feel and they will tell you that they feel safe and nurtured and they love their teachers, their school and Dr. Marotta who is always there with his door open for them. He knows each and every one of them and they know him.&nbsp; He is a visionary who never sways in his belief in learning, respect, and social responsibility.&nbsp; He teaches that not only to the kids but to us parents too.&nbsp; I&#039;m so grateful that he has been a part of my child&#039;s life and I look forward to many more years with him in our lives.&nbsp; As parents we know that our goal right now is to protect and save this unique and valuable institution and if that means selling the land to a developer then so be it.&nbsp; The school will maintain part of the yard for green space and use the money to provide resources to further enrich the teaching and ensure that Garden is here for our children and grandchildren.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with trying to preserve and expand our quality of life in JH by attempting to get more green space but please let&#039;s not lose perspective on what JH institution is truly at stake here.

				The NY1 story was the fair and balanced coverage that this issue has needed.&nbsp; Of course it would be great to do the city/greenspace thing; Garden admits as much and its kids helped run the Play Street last year.&nbsp; As the reporter points out and quotes Michael Rakosi, the city cannot meet the asking price and just because it budgets funds for such a project it doesn&#039;t mean that it will get a go-ahead in a year or two when the money is supposed to become available.&nbsp; And just because an item is in the budget it is not guaranteed funding.&nbsp; Financing the school&#039;s debt to accommodate that is itself is a huge debt burden.&nbsp; There are a lot of promises, but perhaps Garden doesn&#039;t want to put the very existence of the school on money that may or may not appear, and at some point in the future.&nbsp; Anyone interested enough in this story to be reading this should watch the NY1 piece at: http://www.ny1.com/?ArID=133573.

				I&#039;ve watched the NY 1 story a couple of times now and I can&#039;t agree that it is fair and balanced. The story does not cover the Community&#039;s effort to help facilitate the sale of the land to the city. In fact it almost makes it seem as if the city hasn&#039;t done anything to make the deal work out. <br /><br />But what it does do is point out that the school seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth. At the meeting at Community Church a few weeks ago the representatives from the school said they wanted the deal with the city to happen but needed money to cover costs while they waited for the ULURP process to go through. However, whoever this Rakosi guy is in the NY1 piece makes it sound as if they aren&#039;t even happy with the amount of money they have been offered and don&#039;t believe there&#039;s money there at all. They can&#039;t have it both ways either they need money upfront to accept the offer or they simply don&#039;t want what has been offered. <br /><br />What&#039;s even more telling to me is his statement that his &quot;Fiduciary responsibility is greater to the students than to the community&quot;. A lot has been said on this board about how the Garden School is a part of the JH community and how we need to consider the &quot;children of Jackson Heights&quot; yet a comment like that tells me something quite different. <br /><br />If the school really wanted this deal to happen I would think they would be looking for ways to make it work rather than publicly blaming the city for not being able to accommodate their current financial situation. Where was the &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; when they started losing money ?

A private foundation also is looking into possibly loaning the school up to $500,000, a source said.<br /><br />&quot;I remain hopeful that the deal will happen,&quot; said City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), who has spearheaded the push to acquire the property.<br /><br />&quot;The city has given its word that this is extremely high-priority, and they have no intention of backing out of the deal.&quot;<br /><br />But even the community&#039;s generosity may not be enough to sway school officials. It is in bad financial straits after its enrollment dropped with the economy.<br /><br />&quot;If the city came with the money tomorrow, then I&#039;m selling them the property tomorrow,&quot; said Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s board of trustees. But &quot;there&#039;s no money down, there&#039;s no date of closing, there&#039;s no contract.&quot;<br /><br />It could take up to two years for the city&#039;s check to clear due to a lengthy acquisition process. Rakosi said the city has not offered to rent the land in the meantime.<br /><br />&quot;Saying they&#039;re going to do it is different than going to contract, putting down a deposit, licensing the property and closing,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;That&#039;s what all the private developers promised, and they&#039;ll do it by putting up the money immediately.&quot;<br /><br />The board is in talks with a handful of developers, he said, and is close to signing a deal.<br /><br />Rakosi added that the board wasn&#039;t interested in accepting a community loan as a stopgap measure because the city could pull out at any time - leaving the school on the hook for paying back the loan.<br /><br />But Edwin Westley, president of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, wasn&#039;t buying that argument.<br /><br />Westley said that Rakosi challenged him and other local activists at a December meeting to raise money for a loan. Now, after the community has raised about $250,000, the school refuses to meet with them, Westley said.<br /><br />Rakosi, who previously told the Daily News that he didn&#039;t ask the community to raise the money, confirmed that he did, in fact, encourage the fund-raising.<br /><br />&quot;Things have changed since then,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;The offer did not extend to the end of time.&quot;<br /><br />Nevertheless, Jackson Heights Green Alliance President Dudley Stewart, is still soliciting pledges.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the least amounts of park space per capita in the city, according to New Yorkers for Parks.<br /><br />Stewart would like to link Garden&#039;s yard - more than half the size of a football field - to Travers Park by turning the summer-only 78th St. play street into a permanent pedestrian plaza.<br /><br />&quot;A number of parents of current students are going to withdraw their children from the school if the school sells to a developer,&quot; Stewart said.<br /><br />&quot;If an apartment building goes up, it&#039;s a death sentence for the school.&quot;<br />

An applicant must file a standardized Land Use Review Application and all required accompanying documentation with the Department of City Planning (DCP). Copies of all applications and accompanying material are sent to the affected Borough President, Community Board and the City Council within five business days of receipt. If the application involves land in more than one community district it is also sent to the appropriate borough board. The Borough Board is comprised of the Borough President, all Community Board chairs and City Council members within the affected borough.<br /><br />Certification. DCP is responsible for certifying that the application is complete, and ready for public review through the ULURP process.<br /><br />An application cannot be certified until DCP determines that the application includes all forms, plans and supporting documents that are necessary to address all issues related to the application. If the particular application is subject to environmental review, a negative declaration or a conditional negative declaration or a notice of completion of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement must be issued before an application can be certified. There is no mandated time by which this pre-certification review must be completed. The Charter permits applicants or the affected Borough President to appeal to CPC for certification after six months from the date of application submission.<br /><br />Certified applications are sent within nine days to the affected Community Board, Borough President and the City Council and if appropriate, to the Borough Board.<br /><br />Community Board Review. Within sixty (60) days of receiving the certified application, the Community Board is required to hold a public hearing and adopt and submit a written recommendation to CPC, the applicant, the Borough President and when appropriate, the Borough Board. The ULURP rules include provisions relating to the notice and conduct of a Community Board public hearing. ULURP provisions also govern the quorum, vote and content for a Community Board recommendation. If a Community Board fails to act within its time limit or waives its right to act, the application proceeds to the next level of review.<br /><br />Borough President Review. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Community Board recommendation, or if the Community Board fails to act, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the Community Board&#039;s review period, the Borough President shall submit a written recommendation to the City Planning Commission. If an application involves land in more than one community district, the Borough Board may (within the Borough President&#039;s review period) also review and submit a recommendation to CPC. If the Borough President fails to act within the time limit, the application proceeds to CPC.<br /><br />City Planning Commission Review. CPC must hold a public hearing and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the application within 60 days of the expiration of the Borough President&#039;s review period. City Planning Commission hearings are generally held twice a month on Wednesdays in Spector Hall at 22 Reade Street. Adoption of a CPC report approving, modifying or disapproving an application requires an affirmative vote of seven commissioners. If the Borough President has recommended against an application for site selection, disposition of city owned property or acquisition and has recommended an alternative site pursuant to the fair share provisions of the Charter (section 204), then nine affirmative votes are required. CPC then files copies of its decision with the City Council. In most cases, disapproval of an application by CPC is final and terminates ULURP. Disapproved applications for urban renewal plans are subject to Council review. In addition, disapproved applications for special permits, zoning text changes and zoning map changes that the Mayor has certified as necessary are subject to review by the City Council. (Note: No &quot;certificate of necessity&quot; has been issued by any mayor since ULURP went into effect).<br /><br />City Council Review. The City Council does not automatically review all ULURP actions that are approved by CPC. The Charter requires the Council to review certain actions, some only under special circumstances, and makes provision for the Council to elect to review other actions.<br /><br />The City Council automatically reviews (Mandatory Review):<br /><br />zoning map changes;<br />zoning text changes (not subject to ULURP but subject to Charter section 200 and 201);<br />housing and urban renewal plans;<br />disposition of residential buildings, except to non-profit companies for low-income housing<br />The Council may elect to review the following by voting to take jurisdiction within 20 days after CPC files its report (Council &quot;call-up&quot;):<br /><br />- City Map changes;<br />- maps of subdivisions or plattings;<br />- zoning special permits;<br />- revocable consents, franchise RFPâ€™s, and major concessions;<br />- non-City public improvements;<br />- sanitary and waterfront landfills;<br />- disposition of commercial or vacant property;<br />- disposition of residential buildings to nonprofit companies for low-income housing;<br />- acquisition of real property; and<br />- site selection.<br />Applications disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President (Triple no):<br /><br />An application which is subject to elective review by the Council, will be reviewed if that application was disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President, was approved or approved with modifications by the City Planning Commission, and the Borough President files an objection to CPC approval with the Council and CPC within 5 days of receipt of CPC&#039;s approval.<br />Within 50 days of receipt of the CPC report on an application that is either subject to mandatory review, is &quot;called-up&quot; by the Council, or is a &quot;triple no&quot; application, the Council must hold a public hearing, and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />If, during the course of its 50-day review period, the Council decides it wants to approve an application with a modification, it can do so only by referring the proposed modification back to CPC. CPC must then determine if the modification is of such significance that additional environmental review is necessary or that additional review pursuant to ULURP is required. If CPC determines that additional review is needed, the Council may not adopt the modification. If no additional review is needed, the Council can adopt the application with the modification. When the Council proposes a modification, CPC has 15 days to make its determination and during that period the City Council&#039;s 50-day clock is stopped.<br /><br />A City Council action approving, approving with modifications or disapproving most CPC actions, requires a majority vote of the Council. Urban Renewal Plans that have been disapproved by CPC can only be approved by a 3/4 vote of the Council.<br /><br />If the Council fails to act within its review period, the Council shall be deemed to have approved the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />Mayoral Review. Mayoral approval is not required. A decision by the City Council to approve or disapprove a land use application is considered to be final unless the Mayor elects to veto a Council action within 5 days of the vote. The Council, by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of its decision within 10 days of the veto.<br /><br />Applications approved by CPC that the Council did not assume jurisdiction or act on within its 50 day review can also be vetoed by the Mayor within 5 days of the expired Council time period. The Council , by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of the CPC decision within ten days of the veto.

				Those are very good questions, Taggie. What concerns me is the tone. Rather than working with the Councilman and the community to find a solution to these questions, Rakosi seems to be trying to put up obstacles, find problems, and seek any way he can to get out of having to compromise so as to accept a community-friendly solution.

				With all due respect to the staff and board at the Garden School, as well as the students and the parents, I have to agree with Dudley. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School has a lot going for it. &nbsp;It is part of our communityâ€™s history. &nbsp;It has a great after school program in the arts and music. &nbsp;By all accounts, students and parents do feel like an extended family.<br /><br />But over the years, the Garden School has made the decision to, on many levels, set itself apart from the larger community. &nbsp;More recent educational institutions, such as the Renaissance School and 82nd Street Academics have integrated themselves into the fabric of the community through linkages and partnerships and activities that reflect a concern not only for their students and their families, but also for the larger community. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School, it seems, has not even looked at the changing demographics of the neighborhood in recent years, and recognized that the influx of more middle class and upper middle class families with young children should be bringing them lots of business.&nbsp; Instead, they prefer to reach out to Manhattan families and families from more affluent Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods, who find them more economical than Manhattan private schools. &nbsp;<br /><br />When my daughter was 2, I took a tour of their preschool, and seriously considered it as an option for the following year. &nbsp;The program looked great. &nbsp;But I was baffled by the fact that they did not run a UPK program for 4 year olds. &nbsp;Why would I pay for something that should be free for all NY kids? &nbsp;Many active, involved parents who plan carefully for their childrenâ€™s education start looking at quality UPK programs at least a year or two in advance. &nbsp;I wanted to send my 3 year old to the school where she would attend UPK (plus extended day, paid for out of pocked) as a 4 year old. &nbsp;Why would the Garden School decide to exclude that huge pool of parents? &nbsp;It seems to me that a quality UPK program would not only bring money into the school for the kids attending UPK, but would also bring families into the school, a percentage of whom would undoubtedly decide to keep their kids there for kindergarten, and perhaps even through high school!<br /><br />In a neighborhood in which all of the other schools are bursting at the seems, why is the Garden School having low enrollment and financial problems? &nbsp;I believe that for many many years, they have dismissed the surrounding Jackson Heights community. &nbsp;And I believe that their recent actions demonstrate that they intend to continue to dismiss the community. &nbsp;<br /><br />Actually, it is worse than that. &nbsp;They have alienated the community that should be filling their classrooms. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As I research kindergartens for my daughter to attend next September, most of my first choices are schools with crazy competitive lotteries. &nbsp;Renaissance accepted 40 students out of 1400 applications last year. &nbsp;We will apply. &nbsp;We probably wonâ€™t get in. &nbsp; <br /><br />Up until a few weeks ago, the Garden School was my backup. &nbsp;My â€œsafety school.â€ &nbsp;If my daughter did not get into any of the other schools that we are applying to, I could figure out a way to pay the tuition at the Garden School. &nbsp;<br /><br />At this point, I am so mad at the Garden School, that I no longer consider them an option. &nbsp;And Iâ€™ve spoken with quite a few parents of Sept 2011 kindergarteners who feel the same way. &nbsp;<br /><br />As Dudley said, their behavior is â€œbizarre and inexplicable.â€ &nbsp;Unless they plan to sell out once the Race to the Top money, (which will create 64 new charter schools in 2012) starts flowing. &nbsp;<br />

				&nbsp;Choosing a school for one&#039;s child is often a consuming, passionate process. For people wanting a good fit, you start to realize how<br />few choices are that match with your wishes for your children. I wish you the best in your search and appreciate the good and bad<br />points you have made about Garden School. This could be helpful going forward. If 82nd street academics is at $12,000. for pre-k then<br />we are talking about more people in the neighborhood who can and do pay for schools. Along with some of the fine contributions by<br />the religious schools and charters like the lottery based-Renaissance, we do have some choices here but all the more reason to keep<br />Garden School thriving for those who are happy with their approach. Some of the local public schools are terrific for kids who can <br />function in a large classroom but hearing from a friend who is now home schooling a kindergardener who was in a class of 29 kids <br />and one new teacher, it&#039;s at a point where the more options, the better for the whole community. Diversity was a big priority to me<br />and Garden School fares very well here as well as complete language studies through the school years.<br />&nbsp;Have you looked at the charter school in Astoria?

				There is so much going on that I don&#039;t know what information is accurate.<br /><br />But what I will say is it that my boys attended Garden School, and did and have done rather well.&nbsp; Never once did I have a problem with the teachers or the administration, and they were quite attentive to my boys and their educational experience, especially, Dr. Marotta and Mr. Vogel.<br /><br />I worked full-time in the city at the time and never had any concerns about the children.<br /><br />My little ones now attend the summer camp, and they are very happy with all the wonderful activities, the counselors, the sharks in the pool, and the iguana.&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />Dr. Marotta and Mr. Vogel are dedicated and always present, and I see no reason why I would not continue taking my children to the school for the summer program, and other activities that are offered.&nbsp; I have spoken to Mary Maisano, Dr. Marotta and Mr. Vogel in the past and they know about my desire to send the little ones to their full-time program in the near future.<br /><br />No matter what decisions the school makes relating to the yard, I will always consider them a school that strives for academic excellence with much appreciation and respect to their students past and present.<br /><br />I do hope that there is a quick resolution to this ordeal and that we can all move on.<br /><br />Best,

				Not to speak for anyone, but in my opinion, if this project is truly beneficial, which I personally believe it to be, the steps one and two will happen quickly.<br /><br />The BP will likely review the material at her first available land-use meeting (it is either bi-weekly or monthly), then CB3 will review it at the first available meeting(monthly), if all is done right, the minimum time will be the goal, and within 60 days the Dept. of City Planning will do their review.<br /><br />I really doubt that the BP and CB3 will have any trouble sending this project on to the next step, in reality to being on the fast track, the other agencies, I really can&#039;t say.<br /><br />Actually City Council review should not be difficult either, what Councilmember would actually turn down a park in the district with the least park space, and would they really risk ridicule by environmental groups, probably not.<br /><br />There is great opportunity to get this done fast, maybe not fast enough for Garden School, but the sooner it begins, the better chance for a beneficial outcome.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5554.msg37901#msg37901">Quote from: willsweeney on February 11, 2011, 08:38:13 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><strong>Below is definition and a timeline of what ULURP entails. <br />Basically, ULURP would take 6 months which breaks down as:<br />30-60 day review for the Borough President<br />30-60 day review for the Community Board<br />30-60 day review by the Department of City Planning<br />Maximum of 50 days for review by the City Council<br />5 day review for the Mayor *</strong><br /><br /><em>*= there is another 15 day period if the Mayor vetoes and the City Council overrides.</em><br /><br />Here is the full breakdown from the City website: <br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/luproc/ulpro.shtml#review (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/luproc/ulpro.shtml#review)<br /><br />ULURP Review Process <br />Filing of Application. An applicant must file a standardized Land Use Review Application and all required accompanying documentation with the Department of City Planning (DCP). Copies of all applications and accompanying material are sent to the affected Borough President, Community Board and the City Council within five business days of receipt. If the application involves land in more than one community district it is also sent to the appropriate borough board. The Borough Board is comprised of the Borough President, all Community Board chairs and City Council members within the affected borough.<br /><br />Certification. DCP is responsible for certifying that the application is complete, and ready for public review through the ULURP process.<br /><br />An application cannot be certified until DCP determines that the application includes all forms, plans and supporting documents that are necessary to address all issues related to the application. If the particular application is subject to environmental review, a negative declaration or a conditional negative declaration or a notice of completion of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement must be issued before an application can be certified. There is no mandated time by which this pre-certification review must be completed. The Charter permits applicants or the affected Borough President to appeal to CPC for certification after six months from the date of application submission.<br /><br />Certified applications are sent within nine days to the affected Community Board, Borough President and the City Council and if appropriate, to the Borough Board.<br /><br />Community Board Review. Within sixty (60) days of receiving the certified application, the Community Board is required to hold a public hearing and adopt and submit a written recommendation to CPC, the applicant, the Borough President and when appropriate, the Borough Board. The ULURP rules include provisions relating to the notice and conduct of a Community Board public hearing. ULURP provisions also govern the quorum, vote and content for a Community Board recommendation. If a Community Board fails to act within its time limit or waives its right to act, the application proceeds to the next level of review.<br /><br />Borough President Review. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Community Board recommendation, or if the Community Board fails to act, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the Community Board&#039;s review period, the Borough President shall submit a written recommendation to the City Planning Commission. If an application involves land in more than one community district, the Borough Board may (within the Borough President&#039;s review period) also review and submit a recommendation to CPC. If the Borough President fails to act within the time limit, the application proceeds to CPC.<br /><br />City Planning Commission Review. CPC must hold a public hearing and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the application within 60 days of the expiration of the Borough President&#039;s review period. City Planning Commission hearings are generally held twice a month on Wednesdays in Spector Hall at 22 Reade Street. Adoption of a CPC report approving, modifying or disapproving an application requires an affirmative vote of seven commissioners. If the Borough President has recommended against an application for site selection, disposition of city owned property or acquisition and has recommended an alternative site pursuant to the fair share provisions of the Charter (section 204), then nine affirmative votes are required. CPC then files copies of its decision with the City Council. In most cases, disapproval of an application by CPC is final and terminates ULURP. Disapproved applications for urban renewal plans are subject to Council review. In addition, disapproved applications for special permits, zoning text changes and zoning map changes that the Mayor has certified as necessary are subject to review by the City Council. (Note: No &quot;certificate of necessity&quot; has been issued by any mayor since ULURP went into effect).<br /><br />City Council Review. The City Council does not automatically review all ULURP actions that are approved by CPC. The Charter requires the Council to review certain actions, some only under special circumstances, and makes provision for the Council to elect to review other actions.<br /><br />The City Council automatically reviews (Mandatory Review):<br /><br />zoning map changes;<br />zoning text changes (not subject to ULURP but subject to Charter section 200 and 201);<br />housing and urban renewal plans;<br />disposition of residential buildings, except to non-profit companies for low-income housing<br />The Council may elect to review the following by voting to take jurisdiction within 20 days after CPC files its report (Council &quot;call-up&quot;):<br /><br />- City Map changes;<br />- maps of subdivisions or plattings;<br />- zoning special permits;<br />- revocable consents, franchise RFPâ€™s, and major concessions;<br />- non-City public improvements;<br />- sanitary and waterfront landfills;<br />- disposition of commercial or vacant property;<br />- disposition of residential buildings to nonprofit companies for low-income housing;<br />- acquisition of real property; and<br />- site selection.<br />Applications disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President (Triple no):<br /><br />An application which is subject to elective review by the Council, will be reviewed if that application was disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President, was approved or approved with modifications by the City Planning Commission, and the Borough President files an objection to CPC approval with the Council and CPC within 5 days of receipt of CPC&#039;s approval.<br />Within 50 days of receipt of the CPC report on an application that is either subject to mandatory review, is &quot;called-up&quot; by the Council, or is a &quot;triple no&quot; application, the Council must hold a public hearing, and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />If, during the course of its 50-day review period, the Council decides it wants to approve an application with a modification, it can do so only by referring the proposed modification back to CPC. CPC must then determine if the modification is of such significance that additional environmental review is necessary or that additional review pursuant to ULURP is required. If CPC determines that additional review is needed, the Council may not adopt the modification. If no additional review is needed, the Council can adopt the application with the modification. When the Council proposes a modification, CPC has 15 days to make its determination and during that period the City Council&#039;s 50-day clock is stopped.<br /><br />A City Council action approving, approving with modifications or disapproving most CPC actions, requires a majority vote of the Council. Urban Renewal Plans that have been disapproved by CPC can only be approved by a 3/4 vote of the Council.<br /><br />If the Council fails to act within its review period, the Council shall be deemed to have approved the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />Mayoral Review. Mayoral approval is not required. A decision by the City Council to approve or disapprove a land use application is considered to be final unless the Mayor elects to veto a Council action within 5 days of the vote. The Council, by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of its decision within 10 days of the veto.<br /><br />Applications approved by CPC that the Council did not assume jurisdiction or act on within its 50 day review can also be vetoed by the Mayor within 5 days of the expired Council time period. The Council , by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of the CPC decision within ten days of the veto. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				It benefits all discussion of the issue to get more information out about the particulars of the review process and other non-subjective points.&nbsp; Snarky quips and high school insults only waste time.&nbsp; Taking up torches and lanterns against Garden does a disservice to all who would like to see this issue resolved to the benefit of the community and the school.&nbsp; If the city really is offering nearly two million dollars more than previously reported, at a time when its budget is being put to the sword, is &quot;stunned surprise&quot; enough to describe such a turnaround?&nbsp; I think the term &quot;show me the money&quot; comes into play here.&nbsp; Nearly a million and a half more than the reported asking price -- why would a financially stressed city do that?&nbsp; It would be a beautiful resolution, heretofore unthinkable in scope.&nbsp; I would hope all parties would sign on as soon as a contract was put on the table.&nbsp; But as a taxpayer, ... man, I have to hear Bloomberg crying all the time about the unfortunate sacrifices all of us in the city have to make during these difficult times, and we have seen the cuts in services everywhere the working New Yorker goes and the threats and embroglios with teachers, cops, sanitation workers, pension haggling -- how is this $6.8 figure possible, and why?&nbsp; From the Daily News&#039; lips to god&#039;s ears.&nbsp; But you gotta wonder.

				Has it occurred to anyone that the city is reluctant to invest resources (a.k.a taxpayer money) in to a process (ULURP) that may result in the school selling the land to a developer, which seems to be Mr. Rakosi&#039;s clear intention? If the school has cold feet about a deal with the city why would the &quot;Cash-strapped&quot; city invest the time and money in to a process that would merely result in a loss because of the Garden School&#039;s need for as much cash as they can get as soon as possible? <br /><br />Again, I find it necessary to point out that the &quot;Fiduciary Responsibility&quot; of the board, seems to have not been too much of a concern to them in the years leading up to their current financial situation. Yet, all of a sudden it is key to why they can&#039;t sign a deal with the city. &nbsp;<br /><br />The school stated publicly that they would be open to some sort of loan or &quot;option&quot; in the amount of $500,000.00 to cover operating costs while the city completed the ULURP process. The community raised over $250,000.00 in response to that ask, and apparently other organizations have expressed a willingness to loan the money to the school as well. Even Mr. Rakosi admits that he was the one who supported the idea of a community based loan and apparently even offered his own money towards it. But, suddenly it&#039;s not enough. Now they need more money and an iron clad guarantee. The constantly changing story form the Garden School leads one to believe they were never negotiating in good faith to begin with. Has anyone done any research on this Mr. Rakosi and his dealings? I&#039;m very , very skeptical. <br /><br />The &quot;cash strapped&quot; city even came up with more money to offer the school. A big feat in our current economic climate. So I can&#039;t understand why people are questioning how serious the city is about buying this land ? Does it make sense to anyone out there that the politicians involved would risk their reputations and the city (which is ultimately the Mayor) would simply play a game to get us all riled up and never deliver ? <br /><br />Further, if the School is so distrustful of the city, and their surrounding community who have raised an impressive amount in a short time, why have they not signed a deal with any one of the &quot;several developers&quot; they have an offer from? Why do they drag this out yet cry that they are in desperate need of funds ASAP? Seems to me like they could have signed a deal by now. <br /><br />Maybe they should do us all a favor by signing a deal with a developer who will put up an 8 story monstrosity and let the lack of open space along with their poor reputation run the school in to the ground. Then the community can step in and buy the property an turn it in to community center that <strong>truly</strong> benefits the neighborhood. <br /><br />It is very clear that the school&#039;s main market is not the immediate community, otherwise they would listen to the parents and people here who are willing to pitch in their hard earned money to help them stay afloat and develop a valuable community resource that would ensure their reputation and longevity in the neighborhood.

				Greetings,<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit confused.&nbsp; Is it true that community groups have helped raise substantial funds (hundreds of thousands of dollars?) and that the City has sweetened its offer to the Garden School to purchase the lot in question?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, is there another community meeting planned--like the one that occurred in early January at Community Church on 82nd street--with community members, Garden School officials, elected officials and community groups?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I attended that meeting, where about 150 people came out on a snowy night.&nbsp; At that meeting, it was quite heartening to hear from nearly every participant -- including the representatives from the Garden School -- that the overwhelming preference on all sides was for the property in question to be sold to the City rather than to a developer, so that JH could preserve one of the last remaining and sorely needed open spaces in JH.&nbsp; Has something changed? <br /><br />Are there any plans for another meeting of the minds -- and above parties -- to discuss if/how we can make this happen?&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like a great way to sort out what is what.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				Iâ€™m racking my brain to try and figure out what the problem is at this point.&nbsp; Why would the Garden School continue to want to sell to developers, after being offered both an exceptional offer from the City, coupled with generous community donations to tide them through until the City money comes?<br /><br />There has to be some reason, but I canâ€™t figure it out.&nbsp; Here are some absurd ideas, none of which I really believe.&nbsp; But I canâ€™t come up with anything better.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Sears (Garden School Board member and former City Council Rep) is so mad that she lost office after putting all of that money into Travers Park, and didnâ€™t get the park named after her, that she is not going to let the man who she lost the election to (Danny Dromm) lead a movement to improve park space in the community.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden School has already decided it is about to fold, and is just looking to bring in some quick cash now to carry it through until the Race for the Top money starts flowing.&nbsp; (Race for the Top money will bring 64 new charter schools to NYC in 2012, 32 new charter schools in 2013, and 32 more in 2014.)&nbsp; &nbsp;They figure they have a fabulous facility that one of those charter schools will buy out.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s financial mismanagement is so severe that they really desperately need the full $6 million to make it through the end of the school year.&nbsp; In this case, they are certainly not sustainable.&nbsp; See Absurd Theory #2.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s leadership is full of teaparty fanatics, who consider City-owned parks to be beacons of excessively large/invasive government, and would prefer the land to be in the hands of the private sector.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone offer a somewhat less absurd theory?&nbsp; <br /><br />

A private foundation also is looking into possibly loaning the school up to $500,000, a source said.<br /><br />&quot;I remain hopeful that the deal will happen,&quot; said City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), who has spearheaded the push to acquire the property.<br /><br />&quot;The city has given its word that this is extremely high-priority, and they have no intention of backing out of the deal.&quot;<br /><br />But even the community&#039;s generosity may not be enough to sway school officials. It is in bad financial straits after its enrollment dropped with the economy.<br /><br />&quot;If the city came with the money tomorrow, then I&#039;m selling them the property tomorrow,&quot; said Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s board of trustees. But &quot;there&#039;s no money down, there&#039;s no date of closing, there&#039;s no contract.&quot;<br /><br />It could take up to two years for the city&#039;s check to clear due to a lengthy acquisition process. Rakosi said the city has not offered to rent the land in the meantime.<br /><br />&quot;Saying they&#039;re going to do it is different than going to contract, putting down a deposit, licensing the property and closing,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;That&#039;s what all the private developers promised, and they&#039;ll do it by putting up the money immediately.&quot;<br /><br />The board is in talks with a handful of developers, he said, and is close to signing a deal.<br /><br />Rakosi added that the board wasn&#039;t interested in accepting a community loan as a stopgap measure because the city could pull out at any time - leaving the school on the hook for paying back the loan.<br /><br />But Edwin Westley, president of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, wasn&#039;t buying that argument.<br /><br />Westley said that Rakosi challenged him and other local activists at a December meeting to raise money for a loan. Now, after the community has raised about $250,000, the school refuses to meet with them, Westley said.<br /><br />Rakosi, who previously told the Daily News that he didn&#039;t ask the community to raise the money, confirmed that he did, in fact, encourage the fund-raising.<br /><br />&quot;Things have changed since then,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;The offer did not extend to the end of time.&quot;<br /><br />Nevertheless, Jackson Heights Green Alliance President Dudley Stewart, is still soliciting pledges.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the least amounts of park space per capita in the city, according to New Yorkers for Parks.<br /><br />Stewart would like to link Garden&#039;s yard - more than half the size of a football field - to Travers Park by turning the summer-only 78th St. play street into a permanent pedestrian plaza.<br /><br />&quot;A number of parents of current students are going to withdraw their children from the school if the school sells to a developer,&quot; Stewart said.<br /><br />&quot;If an apartment building goes up, it&#039;s a death sentence for the school.&quot;<br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/02/11/2011-02-11_park_deal_in_jackson_heights_teetering_as_city_wont_offer_garden_school_any_mone.html#ixzz1Dh0icEI1<br /><br />__._,_.___<br /><br />Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post | Start a New Topic <br /><br />Messages in this topic (2) <br /><br />Recent Activity: <br /><br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;New Members 10 <br /><br />Visit Your Group <br /><br /><br /><br />Switch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest â€¢ Unsubscribe â€¢ Terms of Use<br /><br />.<br /><br /><br /><br />__,_._,___<br />

If Garden defaults on a payment, the interest rate jumps to 24%.<br /><br />&quot;The economy went bad,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;It was impossible to find an institutional financier. That&#039;s why the rates are so high.&quot;<br /><br />The nursery-through-12th-grade school is about $2.5 million in debt, he said. He attributed the downward financial spiral to a drop in enrollment.<br /><br />Board President Arthur Gruen said he wasn&#039;t sure if the board would decide the fate of the yard tonight. The board tried to get a loan from at least six banks before the Precision deal, he said, noting that Rakosi disclosed his family connection to the board.<br /><br />The transaction was legal because the board was aware of that relationship and looked for loans from other lenders, said bankruptcy lawyer Neil Colmenares.<br /><br />&quot;If this was the only loan that a lender was willing to give the school, then the board members of the school need to do what&#039;s in the best interest of the school,&quot; he said. But, he added, the interest rate seemed a bit high.<br /><br />Rosenbloom refused to comment on the specifics of the loan. He confirmed that Precision went under in 2009. It was unclear what entity succeeded Precision.<br /><br />The city recently offered the school $6.8 million for its 29,000-square-foot yard to expand nearby Travers Park. But the city isn&#039;t offering Garden any money up front or guarantees it will buy the property due to its lengthy acquisition process.<br /><br />The city isn&#039;t out of the running, Rakosi said, adding: &quot;I&#039;d be happy if the city sat down and rented the field or purchased the field.&quot;<br />

				agreed, Marlene and Shinjuku....<br /><br />i started off sympathetic to the school, which has been a linchpin of this community since long long before i was born, but as facts have come to light (and the school&#039;s chosen mouthpiece has spoken more and more), my sympathies have started to shift. it&#039;s a shame to see a fine institution dragged down like this.<br />

				I hope that Danny&#039;s office investigates the Board Meeting Minutes that should document what lead up to this absurd decision. &nbsp;<br /><br />I also think that the personal finances of the board members should be investigated, because i can&#039;t believe that a loan like that was taken without kickbacks. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Board members are people with money that they are used to managing. And their personal investments were having a bad year because nothing was paying interest or dividends. &nbsp; I cannot believe that they would have made a decision like this on behalf of the school, unless there was some personal benefit, which would constitute criminal activity. &nbsp;

				The sad thing is this: if nothing technically illegal occurred, these revelations do not change the fact that the board of directors of the Garden School can do what they please. It&#039;s not a community decision--the lot is private property, and it has been made clear that the leadership of this particular organization does not, at this moment, give a damn what the community wants.

				I have a bunch of questions.<br /><br />First of all, <strong>is it possible to get an injunction against the sale, pending an investigation of potential impropriety</strong>? <br /><br />Secondly, <strong>if the sale takes place, is it then possible for the city to invoke eminent domain and take over the land from the potential developers</strong>?<br /><br />Finally, <strong>is there anyone who can help the Garden School get a better deal on this ridiculous loan</strong>? &nbsp;People get better mortgages or transfer their credit card debt to a card with a better rate all the time. &nbsp;Given that there are clearly a bunch of offers on the table for this land, there must be some legitimate creditor willing to give them a loan at market rates.<br /><br />

				<strong>Updates from the Grow a Park campaign.</strong><br /><br />We have raised over $270,000 in pledges so far! We still need to reach our target of $500,000, so if you have not pledged yet please send an email to pledges@growapark.org with your name, address, phone number and pledge amount.<br /><br /><strong>Mayor&#039;s Office</strong><br /><br />Today (Friday the 18th) Deputy Mayor Wolfson is meeting with the Board of Trustees and the administration of the Garden School to iron out the details of the City&#039;s offer for the athletic field. We remain very hopeful that the result will be good for the school and the community! We will keep you informed as soon as we hear something about this.<br /><br /><strong>Outreach campaigns</strong><br /><br />There are teams of people targeting the local merchants, you may have seen some stores sporting the &quot;We pledged!&quot; signs in their windows and work continues on reaching out to banks, philantropists, celebrities and foundations.<br /><br />We are also working hard on increasing awareness of our campaign and there has been a lot of interest from the press, most recently The New York Times covered the story - links to that article and all the others are in the press section of our campaign website, <strong>www.growapark.org</strong><br /><br />I&#039;d also like to highlight the series of articles that the New York Daily News has been featuring on the Garden School issue and the Grow a Park campaign. Links to the articles can be found on our website.<br /><br /><strong>JHBG Newsletter<br /></strong><br />Our partners, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group released their newsletter in which the Grow a Park campaign was extrensively covered. If you haven&#039;t received their newsletter you can contact them through their website at <strong>www.jhbg.org</strong> and become a member - they are a very valuable organization in our neighborhood who offer a lot of great projects you can become involved in, from a clean streets movement to the musical performances of Summer Sundays, and more.<br /><br /><strong>Letter writing campaign</strong><br /><br />Our letter writing campaign was a huge success which resulted in over 600 letters from neighborhood children to the Mayor asking for more park space in our neighborhood. We are planning to make good use of all of this hard work very soon. <br /><br /><strong>Finally</strong>, we are hoping to work more closely with the Garden School over the coming days and weeks, to support their outreach efforts to parents and alumni in order to continue getting pledges which will help alleviate the school&#039;s financial needs until the money from the City comes through. <br /><br />Thank you to everyone who has pledged and volunteered and offered advice and suggestions!<br /><br />Get Involved,<br /><br />Dudley<br />Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br />dudley@jhgreen.org

				&nbsp;Choices in education in Jackson Heights may be even more scarce than green space. Garden School has broad appeal <br />to parents who are looking for a school that doesn&#039;t have endless testing in all grades, diversity, languages, arts, gym<br />&amp; music as well as the traditional subjects that are taught for the most part in a traditional way. We are lovin&#039; it as a<br />family and while it&#039;s not a fit for everyone, those of us that have this set of factors on our wish list seem to be happy.<br />This year&#039;s group of seniors are kids anyone would be proud of as people and students and as a reflection of the values<br />taught at the school <br />The Garden trustees went to the city nearly a year ago, as I understand it, with an offer of first refusal. And some kind of <br />workable timeline. Danny Dromm was terrific in getting the funds together before most people in the community knew<br />anything about it. The issue of time which I believe prompted the fundraising is being rapidly solved, as I understand it,<br />so that this is all looking like the plan, as it was first purposed will come to fruition. Thanks again to the speedy and <br />mysterious ULURP action.<br />&nbsp;Two universities in NYC, Columbia and NYU, have both had issues with their neighbors about properties. I do know though<br />that if my child wanted to attend either school and it was a fit for them, that this would be a concern but not a deciding<br />factor as I would put my child&#039;s interest first. This is how my family operates and yours may be much different.<br />&nbsp;I hope going forward that the attention given here by the Green Agenda will be used to get more people to really help<br />with the physical stuff of making the community better. Boots on the ground stuff. Or maybe work gloves and mud shoes.<br />Help our trees. Volunteer at Playstreet. Reseed the yard at St. Marks play area.&nbsp; Make a Jackson Heights Conservancy <br />group so the developers who may be looking at other properties now can be met with monies in a timely fashion with<br />tax deductible donations. Can the list be archived with donors contacts in case the Toyota property or Queens Savings <br />Bank land do become available? The school kids did a great Jackson Heights history book about 10-12 years ago, all<br />the local schools together, and maybe it&#039;s time for another collaborative effort there.<br />&nbsp;Garden School has been proud to be in this community for 88 years now and given the draconian cuts we see coming <br />down the pike for Public Schools and with teacher&#039;s anger at being unsupported, it is nice to know that they continue to <br />be part of educational options here in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />

				and the parent satisfaction/happiness surveys i&#039;ve seen online indicate that parents of kids at 212 and 145 are as happy -- and in some cases, happier -- with the education their children are receiving than those attending our private schools (and i am by no means suggesting the academics are sub par at the latter).

				&nbsp;As to the mysterious ULURP process, here is my question. It was stated earlier on this topic that a real snag in this negotiation was going to be<br />the timeline of ULURP process. That this was a big deal and there was no way around it as it&#039;s a government mandated review taking 12-18 months.<br />Since the whole negotiation is still under a year from day 1 from when the school went to the local officials and it looks like the news of the <br />completed sale - to the city- is not too far away, how did we mysteriously clear this hurdle? Just wondering.

				I became involved in this discussion about a month ago when it seemed Garden school was taking slings and arrows from the community, and good people like Dr. Marotta were having to endure unfounded personal attacks.&nbsp; At this point I feel and I hope others here can agree that the topic has moved into more issue-oriented territory.&nbsp; There is less outrage from all sides and importantly, as I am a Garden parent, I think the community has read enough contributions from bloggers that show the school is really on the same page as the groups and individuals outside the school, that a greenspace/park would be ideal for all, but also that the immediate future of the school makes the issue more pragmatic than ideological from the Garden side.&nbsp; In sum, more good ideas have been pushed to the center of the table of late.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope that it adds up to good things for the school and the community. ... And by the way -- Taggie has been a very positive and informed voice on this topic, which has been most helpful.&nbsp; And, since someone asked, ... yes, I DO think T. is in fact the voice of Garden, sort of a Kissinger-style Foggy Bottom shadow government.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you?

				No, actually, I don&#039;t think Taggie is the Official Voice. I think Taggie, like you and several others, are concerned parents who have the best interests of their childrens&#039; education in mind. You both are obviously happy that their children are receiving an excellent education and want it to continue.<br /><br />When the school has resolved the sale, or has some information for the public, I think it will come from someone who identifies themselves, by name, as a spokesperson for the school.<br />

				&nbsp;Questions of identity are bigger than this land sale? Aw, come on. This is all ya got? The Jackson Heights that I think we all want to live in is<br />one in which we are all treated fairly and with respect and to be allowed to do our own thing in so far as it doesn&#039;t harm our neighbors. Isn&#039;t<br />that the great legacy of this diverse neighborhood? I hope that we can all show the same warmth and welcoming spirit here regardless of where we worship, work or educate our families. Yes, we do have some wonderful public schools, some terrific parochial and private schools, along with some less great (think overcrowding), and going to school in the neighborhood is of tremendous value to children in a whole host of ways - academically, emotionally and socially. But I do think we have to give as good as we get in terms of information and keep posting here only because of the lack of balance on this topic for all in the community. Some members have news that certain organizations, say the twelve steppers, might deem as falling into the &quot;sin of omission&quot; regarding this negotiation. There has been a real lack of representation of those like myself who are v. happy with the Garden School, respectful of how it&#039;s run*, and who look forward to the green space going to the city. There is an expectation that some in the community have endless hours to spend keeping up with details and tracking and posting the errors, missteps or omissions of one side vs. another. This is tiresome and wastes precious energy that could be used for the betterment of the whole green situation, if that is really the interest here. <br />&nbsp;As the situation comes to a close, I hope that someone has the cojones to come forward and say that maybe seeing the Garden School as the enemy rather than a very willing partner and team member was, perhaps, a misjudgement confirmed by the presence of so many GS community members as pledgers on the grow-a-park site. And that going forward if we walk together to make this the kind of community that fights for open spaces and for choices in education and a multitude of other list items that would make JH better, we will work smarter and be stronger as a group.<br /><br />*a big error that I concede those of us in the Garden School community have made is to be so quiet about what really goes on in the school<br />and I hope that with the infusion of these monies there will be givebacks to the community in ways they had talked about but couldn&#039;t fund<br />before. and in my own opinion, I am at fault for treating it like a favorite small restaurant that you want to keep going but don&#039;t want it to <br />be too well-known so as to leave you out. mea culpa.

				Sorry for the lack of updates, there hasn&#039;t been much to report on at the moment. The situation is that Deputy Mayor Wolfson met with the school on the 18th.

Let us know at pledges@jhgreen.org<br />&nbsp;<br />As soon as we receive an announcement from the Deputy Mayor&#039;s office we will let you know.

Last year we enjoyed this car-free street in Jackson Heights for two entire months and this year we are planning to do it from July 1st to September 30th.<br />&nbsp;<br />Along with our partners in the Jackson Heights Beautification Group we&#039;re hoping to make it the best one yet, but we need some help getting it off the ground this year.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Making the Play Street Better</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />In addition to offering more space for our kids to play, we have always wanted the Play Street to be the Public Plaza or Town Square of our neighborhood. We want this to be an oasis not only to families with young children but everyone else in our community - for people who want to get to know their neighbors and socialize, read a newspaper,&nbsp; participate in a class, attend an event, or who just want to people-watch, relax and enjoy the diversity of our community in a public space where everyone feels welcome.<br />&nbsp;<br />In order to achieve this, we want to make Play Street a neighborhood-wide effort. We will organize a Community Placemaking Workshop in the near future to brainstorm ideas and elicit more support, participation and ownership. We hope the Workshop will help us organize things better, and in a more inclusive way. We want us all take ownership of the space and are looking for your ideas for activities, amenities and program contributions. We&#039;ll announce the date, time and location very soon.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Shade and other amenities</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;re looking for people who will be able to help us design some of the Play Street&#039;s infrastructure, specifically seating and shade. We had canopies last year which provided shade in some sections but they proved to be delicate and labor-intensive (they had to be set up and dismantled every day). We&#039;re exploring more dramatic and creative options for this year and we would love to have some help with this. If you are handy with tools or can help design a system of ropes and sails that would provide cover using very limited attachment points please do let us know so we can talk!<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for all of your support for the neighborhood!<br /><br />Dudley<br />The Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br />info@jhgreen.org

				What happened to Garden School&#039;s claim that they did not have enough money to make it past June as the reason they needed the sale in the first place? Did they all of a sudden come into some money? Was it bull from the first day and just their way to inflate the price of the lot through public outrage in their negotiation with the City? <br />

				&nbsp;As far as I can surmise, the ball is in the city&#039;s court. And it&#039;s taking awhile like everyone thought it would. Am guessing on some<br />very hot day that there will be nice photo op and the plans will be revealed that someone seems to have worked on with the<br />field. Was it the Daily News that ran that drawing? Anyway, yes, Garden School has made some financial strides and with<br />enrollment up, serious fundraising, belt-tightening, etc. the urgency that prompted the school to look long term at it&#039;s<br />finances has been helpful. Think say of an unemployed friend who you were concerned about finally getting a promising new<br />job. No benefits yet but a better day than yesterday. It also doesn&#039;t hurt that the public schools are currently in chaos about<br />next year especially any that have newer teachers who may well be gone in June. GS has a wonderful stable of fine teachers.<br />&nbsp;If you wanted to prod or antagonize anyone here, it would be the city who needs to make the next move.

				But, of course, its fine if people spread misinformation about Garden school, right? <br /><br />When the deal with the city goes through, and the neighborhood gets more park space, I would hope that the residents of Jackson Heights would start supporting the Garden school at little, and be nicer to the families there. We do have a part time nursery program that&#039;s competitively priced similar to others in the neighborhood. And of course our summer camp. You can also rent our pool for parties, and our gym. Most of the parents at the school work very hard to send their kids there and sacrifice vacations and other expensive habits. We are not the elite rich we are working class people also.

				We actually help organize one of the summer pool-shares, so if that&#039;s supporting the Garden School, we support the Garden School. We&#039;re very happy the deal is going forward because we would have hated to cancel the pool-share, it&#039;s something the kids really love in the hot days of summer.<br /><br />My only complaint about the Garden School was that they were going to put up a giant apartment building on their ballfield.

				&nbsp;Yes, this is a wonderful result. Speaking as a believer from the first time I heard about the Garden School approaching <br />the city with this type of arrangement in mind, I knew it would play out this way, albeit 2 1/2 years after the first contact<br />to the city. We get to keep this lovely school as a part of Jackson Heights educational offerings and both the school and <br />the community get improvements in the athletic field. Along with the recreation area on the other side at IS145 and the<br />new park space at PS69, we have a lot to celebrate in the community.<br />&nbsp;Happy days!

				Definitely a great accomplishment that so many people made possible. I ahve to keep thanking Councilman Dromm who championed this and never let up.<br /><br />BTW 2 - 2 1/2 is relatively quick for a project as complicated as this. My oldest son was 11 when we at JHBG and St. Joan of Arc Youth Council started our campaign to get a ballfield renovated at Landing Light Park. It will be opening shortly. He&#039;s 22.

				NY Times article<br /><br />In Shift, a Queens School Will Sell Land to the City (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/nyregion/garden-school-in-queens-will-sell-land-to-city-not-developer.html)<br /><br />A financially troubled private school in Jackson Heights, Queens, has agreed to sell an athletic field to New York City rather than follow through on a controversial plan to sell it to a private developer.<br /><br />In an agreement made final on Wednesday, the city will pay the Garden School $6 million for the land, nearly 30,000 square feet of open space that will be conjoined to one of the areaâ€™s few parks, Travers Park, a largely concrete expanse on 78th Street. Last year, the school, which was then over $2 million in debt, rejected a bid from the city, theorizing that a developer with cash on hand would be able to pay the school more quickly.<br /><br />â€œThe school was saying at that time that they needed the city to hurry up because they were afraid of the length of the process,â€ said Daniel Dromm, a Democratic city councilman who represents the area and pushed for the cityâ€™s offer.<br /><br />Under the terms of the agreement, the school will receive about $800,000 in interest-free bridge loans from two organizations that preserve open space, to tide it over until the city money comes through, said Michael F. Rakosi, the vice president of the schoolâ€™s board of trustees. The school will also have exclusive use of the field from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays.<br /><br />Those factors caused the school, which has 300 pupils and charges about $15,500 tuition, to change course, Mr. Rakosi said. He added that the often-heated campaign the community had waged did not sway the decision.<br /><br />â€œThey were extremely rough on getting it, rough on me, rough on the school,â€ Mr. Rakosi said of those in the community who opposed selling the land to a developer. But, he added, â€œour job as board members is to do the best we could for our kids.â€<br /><br />â€œWe would like to do as well for the community,â€ he continued, â€œbut my first charge is to take care of my kids.â€<br /><br />City Hall officials took a lead role in the discussions. Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor who was directly involved in the negotiations, said the talks â€œat times got very passionate.â€<br /><br />â€œThe community was very passionate about doing everything it could to preserve this as open space and have it for community use,â€ Mr. Wolfson said, â€œand the school very much wanted to reap fair value for the land. And we were asked to kind of step in and see if we could help mediate.â€<br /><br />â€œAt the end of the day,â€ he added, â€œeveryone got something they wanted.â€<br /><br />The bulk of the money for the purchase came from Mr. Drommâ€™s discretionary fund; the fund of the Queens borough president, Helen Marshall, and the city budget each contributed $1 million.<br /><br />Mr. Dromm said it would take additional contributions to renovate the park, which will not break ground for over a year. That cost and the financing source has not yet been established, he said.<br /><br />CLICK ON LINK FOR ARTICLE

				Wow, that landing lights owner was very patient! Waiting 11 years for the sale is impressive. Who was the seller if I may ask?<br />And great to add that to the new collection of open spaces.

				Landing Lights Park was always owned by the city. It just took a long time for the city to decide to renovate the ballfield. There was opposition from a few people who lived near the field. We collected 1,200-1,400 signatures on a petition to get that moving, most them gathered at the Waldbaum shopping center, not far from the field.
