			Has anyone bought&nbsp; groceries online from Fresh Direct?&nbsp; If yes, do they schedule a delivery around your schedule?&nbsp; Were you happy with the quality of your order?

			Buddy, this response won&#039;t be terribly helpful to you, but as a consumer, I&#039;ve decided to opt out of Fresh Direct as a whole.&nbsp; Believe me, I&#039;m no stickler for political correctness, but that whole alleged union busting fiasco that Fresh Direct was involved in late last year sort of left a sour taste in my mouth.&nbsp; Oh yeah...I&#039;m well aware that other businesses may be involved in similar dealings, but I strongly feel that if I make this one choice now, perhaps it can make a small difference.&nbsp; It also helps that I know someone that was directly affected by this.

			There is a thread on chowhound with the title &quot;Freshdirect in Jackson Heights&quot; which might (or might not!) be helpful.&nbsp; Here it is http://www.chowhound.com/topics/397202

			I order fresh direct about 2 times a month.&nbsp; Since it has become more popular in Jackson Heights, you need to order about two days in advance from when you want it to be delivered.&nbsp; I used to be able to order the night before without any problem.&nbsp; You choose a two hour time window for delivery.&nbsp; Not all days are available here.&nbsp; You should check the available delivery times before you go through the trouble of making an order.<br /><br />I find the prices are similar to the grocery store with some items being relatively cheaper, like organic milk, and others being more expensive.&nbsp; My experience with their fruit hasn&#039;t been good, but the vegetables are fine.&nbsp; I like the marinades they offer with their meats.&nbsp; My husband doesn&#039;t like the cold cuts because he says they are cut too thin, but that&#039;s how I like them.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely a good option if you like a nice organic selection and have a specific list of what you want.&nbsp; I spend less when I order fresh direct because I avoid all those things I tend to pick up when I&#039;m walking around the grocery store.&nbsp; The delivery guys are great too.&nbsp; If they&#039;re running ahead of schedule they will call you to see if you&#039;d like your order delivered earlier.&nbsp; Overall, I&#039;m a fan.

			I have used Fresh Direct once, while i lived in Astoria and I picked up, that was before they delivered there of course.&nbsp; I found the quality of the meats to be very good.&nbsp; In light of their recent employee issues, I can&#039;t spend my $ with them. <br /><br />http://gothamist.com/2007/12/12/fresh_direct_ex.php<br /><br />With that said, I know alot of ppl who use and love Fresh Direct, and I just can&#039;t bring myself to do it--I find them pricey and I feel it is ultimately a bad decision (over-packaging, employment issues and fuel costs).&nbsp; I somehow feel supporting local business is better for the environment, overall.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will make a few changes this spring though (since most of our local fruit stands, while I love the convenience, import from all over the world burning gobs of petrol) --I am joining Farmspot to support local farmers and will begin buying my meat from Dines Farms.&nbsp; I feel this is the best use of my resources to support local farms, farmers and family-owned shops (It. Farms, Local fruit markets, etc.). Not a perfect situation in JH yet, but improving.&nbsp; Just my opinion, of course.
