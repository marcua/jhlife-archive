			Thanks all for the recs.<br /><br />I really want to try La Fusta after reading that thread-I&#039;ll check it out. <br />We have walked to Pio Pio before and enjoyed it very much-that may be the best chicken I&#039;ve had.<br />We do have a vegetarian in the group however, so I have to consider the menu.<br />I haven&#039;t done Shripriphai yet, my brother thinks it somewhat over-rated, but that may work.<br /><br />I like this Sapori Dischia place. Sounds perfect. My parents are both Italophiles.<br />How pricey is it?<br /><br />Thanks again.

			Sapori has an &quot;Opera&quot; night during the week, it may be Wednesdays or Thursdays.&nbsp; It can be loads of fun!

			I highly recommend La Fusta.&nbsp; The prices are great for the quality and amount of food you get and the ambiance is very nice and intimate.&nbsp; I&#039;d go with the half skirt steak if you&#039;re a meat eater.&nbsp; Most people I know, even large men, cannot finish the full skirt steak - it&#039;s massive!!!!&nbsp; Their chimichurri in an incredible mix of garlic, olive oil and herbs.&nbsp; The ribs are also delicious and their tripe soup is a killer.&nbsp; Watercress salads are refreshing and they also have a nice selection of desserts.&nbsp; Their Argentinean malbec selections are also very nice for Elmhurst and reasonably priced.<br /><br />

			Forgot to post a sample menu link for Sapori d&#039;Ischia from New York Magazine.&nbsp; It lists pricing information.&nbsp; Keep in mind that Sapori is notorious for charging for bottled water, and they&#039;ve been known to bring it to your table even if you haven&#039;t ordered it!<br /><br />http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/sapori-dischia/menus/dinner.html

			<br />
			One advice on Sapori d&#039;Ischia.&nbsp; They will charge you for bottled water, as will any other restaurants, but they will refuse to serve tap water when requested.<br /><br />Some people find this offensive, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a heads up.
