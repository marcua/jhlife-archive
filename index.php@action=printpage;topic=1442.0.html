				Is the Colton a co-op?&nbsp; If so, go to the Board and ask to see the official contract with the elevator vendor- it sounds very high.&nbsp; It&#039;s within your right since you are being assessed for it. If you&#039;re in a condo, there has to be something similar like a condo board, right?&nbsp; I know for our building, we got an estimate of $100,000 for an overhaul of both elevators.&nbsp; The estimate is several years old, but certainly at current prices, wouldn&#039;t have tripled to what it&#039;s costing you.

				One thing you should determine is if there were at least three bids solicited.<br /><br />If two elevators are being replaced and not repaired, that&#039;s $150K per elevator, which doesn&#039;t sound unreasonable. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a 4-story church that needs a new elevator (just one elevator) and the cost is $400,000.&nbsp; This was the lowest of three bids. http://www.stmichaels.org/stmichaels/elevator-update.html<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Shelby2:<br /><br />There is also dissatisfaction with the services in plumbing that they have not touched.&nbsp; We&#039;ve complained many times.&nbsp; A person has the right to flush their own toilet after midnight without having to worry about a loud jackhammer sound that lasts a good 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; There have been several complaints about this, and the answer we received in return was &quot;Its the city plumbing.&nbsp; We can&#039;t help that&quot;.&nbsp; We&#039;re paying mortgage to worry about flushing the toilet after midnight.&nbsp; $300,000.00 to replace elevators, not to mention the inconvenience of them not working for six months (there are residents who are elderly and or have disabilities that prevent them from walking well or walking at all) is just beyond rediculous.<br /><br />My spouse and I have taken it upon ourselves to write MPJ Realty and ask them for a complete break down of where our money is going.&nbsp;

				Are the cabs being redone?&nbsp; If so, $300K isn&#039;t ridiculous at all - at our building, we are having our elevator mechanism replaced and it is running upwards of $100K - add in the cabs and there you go.<br /><br />The Colton has about 100 units, right?&nbsp; That breaks down to about $3000 per apartment, which isn&#039;t so bad a home maintenance expense...<br />

				We&#039;re still getting the financial breakdown.&nbsp; To be told there&#039;s nothing they can do about the plumbing and to inconvenience residents isn&#039;t what I call good maintenance.&nbsp; Must be wonderful to have power over residents whey they know moving is an impossibility with how expensive real estate is in the tri-state area...

				You also have weigh in the safety factor.&nbsp; Exactly what is the condition of the elevators?&nbsp; Keep in mind that resident safety is a major reason for elevator renovations.&nbsp; Also consider the cost of having to pay for frequent elevator maintenance visits.&nbsp; In the long run, it may be cheaper to renovate the elevators than to continue running the old ones.&nbsp; There are new safety features available today that are not seen in older elevators, such as emergency call buttons that put residents in contact with elevator maintenance companies as well as the local fire department, systems that ensure leveled cab landings, etc.<br /><br />As far as it being a tremendous inconvenience to residents, it certainly is.&nbsp; When our co-op underwent elevator renovations, we were lucky enough to have many residents volunteer to help out with grocery shopping, picking-up meds, laundry help, etc.&nbsp; Parents were given the opportunity to &quot;park&quot; baby strollers in a locked basement room for easy access.&nbsp; Our Board coordinated the volunteer staff, and the 6 week renovation period for each elevator went by without a hitch.&nbsp; What also helped is that some of our senior residents opted to stay with family rather than remain in the building.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how a plan like this would help in your situation because 6 months is quite a long time!

				does you condo have a reserve fund and if so why aren&#039;t they using at least some of that money to&nbsp; pay for the renovations?<br /><br />On the plumbing issue, I would ask to see a report from three plumbers regarding the clanking noise stating that it is &quot;just city plumbing&quot;.&nbsp; I am certain that it is not a big job to correct this.<br />Maybe it is time for revamp the board members and get new ones.<br /><br />good luck

				does your condo have a savings account and if so why isn&#039;t some of the money going into paying for this improvement?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if J-51&#039;s apply to condos but you might inquire about that also.<br /><br />Also with regard to the plumbing issue, I would require the board to provide me with 3 opinions from licensed plumbers.&nbsp; I think that the clanking problem is a relatively easy one to fix, and not expensive.<br /><br />Perhaps it is time to rethink the board and get some new blood in there.<br /><br />good luck

				Regarding the toilet issue.&nbsp; If the sound you&#039;re describing is the same as what I experienced several months ago, then at some point, your toilet will no longer flush.&nbsp; The issue was a little rubber ring that broke and didn&#039;t seal properly anymore (this was around piping that came out of the wall, not inside).&nbsp; The super only had to replace the ring and everything was fine again.&nbsp; It was really odd that such a little thing could cause such an alarming sound.&nbsp; Each time I flushed I thought our toilet was going to explode- that or the piping!

				<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">I think that the average elevator with a 7 stories elevation would be about $150k each for new ones.&nbsp; That&#039;s what a building in Corona just paid about a year ago for each of the 2 brand new ones. The problem may be arising from the fact that MPJ is involved in the construction industry.&nbsp; When this happens MGMT companies will often be too involved in bids and contracts.&nbsp; I always recommend that the Board also bring in bids from outside sources and not simply the MGMT companies.&nbsp; When you are dealing with small, everyday maintenance issues like painting, spot electrical and plumbing as well as groundskeeps and upkeep of mechanical systems.&nbsp; When it comes to major capital improvement projects and expensive undertakings like elevators, boilers, roof replacements and such it is wise to involve a committee.&nbsp; <br /><br />In one of the buildings where I served on the board we created a beautification committee that also doubled as the construction committee whenever we had a major project coming up.&nbsp; We also had an admitions committee and a groundskeep committee that was mostly active during the warmer months and during X-mas.&nbsp; The trick was to have a Bd member head the committee but the remainder of the members would be shareholders that were not part of the Board thus ensuring that the responsibilities of the building are shared and spread out. The Board usually voted on the recommendations of that committee.&nbsp; Not until I began dealing with other Coops I realized how well the buildings were I served and still own units were ran.&nbsp; The truth is that most MGMT companies hate when the Boards get involved with the larger construction projects since this is one of the ways they make the extra $$$.</span>

				<strong>I guess there&#039;s a lot more people reading this threat then I thought.&nbsp; Let me clarify my position on somethings that I said here since I have received a few phone calls about the subject of The Monterey.<br /><br />a.&nbsp; MPJ is a Management company and it is no different than any other company I have ever dealt with, big or small.&nbsp; Their job is to pay bills and to assist the Bldg in their day to day operations.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know them well so I can&#039;t say anything negative about these people.&nbsp; Mgmt firms are eager to help the Board out all the time but that is probably the number one mistake most mgmt companies make.&nbsp; Pleasing the Board sometimes means messing up the bottom line and then the Bldg and Bd blames the Mgmt Company.&nbsp; This goes for all of them, MPJ or anyone else.&nbsp; There seems to be a trend nowadays in that the Mgmt companies get very involved in the construction business part of the business and I stand corrected, (someone reminded me), that since most Boards don&#039;t like to get involved in the construction process Mgmt ends up having to do 99% of the work.<br /><br /><br />b.&nbsp; The Monterey is in great shape, I like the Bldg, I like the Super and I like the president...but it seems that other members are just warming up the seats they hold.&nbsp; The President did buy a distressed unit with the understanding the he improves it and sells it.&nbsp; This was in&nbsp; fact a very smart move since letting an apartment in distressed into the open market can only lower the overall value and reputation of any coop.&nbsp; If I was in the Board I would have done the same thing.&nbsp; I have never had beef with the guy and I don&#039;t have any reason to.&nbsp; People reading more into things should know that a 3rd party attempted to disrupt the peace.&nbsp; Something did take place so I decided to step aside instead of dealing with the BS.&nbsp; My decision was mine and had nothing to do with the guy personally and he always expressed genuine concern for the overall wellness of the building.&nbsp; He has lots of experience and has served in many Boards in the past.&nbsp; Yes, I believe the Monterey needs to revise the lower than average reserve but that may be an issue that has been resolved and if not it can easy be resolved within a few weeks.&nbsp; Anyone thinking of buying in the Monterey should know that it is a good Bldg to invest in.<br /><br />c.&nbsp; I know people in the Building that should run for the Board but for one reason or another wont.&nbsp; My recommendation to those people is that they should join a committee.&nbsp; Ask some of the Board members if there is an opportunity to join a beautification or financial or even a welcoming committee.&nbsp; It is a thankless job to be part of a board but participating in a committee can be lots of fun.</strong><br /><span style="font-size: 13pt;" class="bbc_size"><br />Now if there are no more questions I&#039;ll go and have a greasy and delicious Ribeye&nbsp; &nbsp;:D</span>

				That company MPJ is a horrorible company that doesn&#039;t do anything to maintain apts in their buildings.. Various problems in. A lot of their Apts. they lack the skill to get serious things done to show why they charge so much for maintainance. U might not be able to reach them as this name to Avoid court sentences they changed their name.&nbsp; Lenny the president and owner of the corp he lacks any real skill to get things done right . Too cheap to get new things for its buildings . Elevator breaks almost like clock work and doesn&#039;t get a new put in like a real management company would.&nbsp; Refuses to fix leeks that is the buildings problem they keep getting people sick with holes they put in the walls to see if there is a leaks. They take their time to get such hazardous things.&nbsp; I have gotten chronic sinus problems due to this.. They also don&#039;t change the windows to replace the old and broken windows that are coming apart..&nbsp; They know they are in the wrong legal action should be taken till they either do something or Lenny resigns. For lack of action to the tenants and the lack if action to take care of the buildings he owns.&nbsp; As well as lack of board of directors of the Co ops in some buildings. Which is illegal .. Giving no voice to the tenants ... I think if there is major problems to go to the main office and speak ur minds ... Please do go pay a visit to them and tell them<br />How u really feel.. About their lack of real management and to show up and have your voice heard.. <br /><br /><br /><br />
