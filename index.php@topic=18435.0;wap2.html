			Here&#039;s a great NY Times profile of Jackson Heights from 1983.&nbsp; Lots of interesting details here. <br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/realestate/jackson-heights.html<br /><br />Here&#039;s one amusing bit of trivia: Today, as we await the opening of restaurants named &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;Julieta&quot; in different parts of the neighborhood, there were once eateries by these names directly across the street from one another in JH.

			that one -- the one across from Foodtown -- is called Due Fratelli. pretty mediocre for delivery/full pies, but they do have a lot of bells-and-whistles slices, if that&#039;s your thing. you know, salad slices, greek slices, chicken, bacon and pineapple slices. a decent stromboli, though, and the guys are very nice.
