				History<br />In 1971, the first two cereals in the line were introduced, the still-available Count Chocula and (strawberry flavored) Franken Berry. Boo Berry was released two years later, in 1973, and Fruit Brute appeared a year after that, in 1974. Fruit Brute was discontinued by 1983 and replaced in 1987 by Fruity Yummy Mummy, which also had a short life and was discontinued in 1993[citation needed]. Boo Berry and Franken Berry are sometimes mistakenly thought to be discontinued as well. In reality, their distribution is just much lower and more sporadic than that of the flagship cereal Count Chocula. The best time of the year to find Boo Berry and Franken Berry is around Halloween[citation needed].<br /><br />Target and Wal-Mart are among the stores that have been known to carry these more scarce cereals during October in time for Halloween. They can be found year-round in the Midwest at Wal-Mart Supercenters and on Amazon.com, and in the Southeast in many stores. In addition, they have been spotted year-round in some Wal-Mart Supercenters in the East[citation needed].<br /><br />Somewhat unusual for retired advertising characters, Fruity Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute continue to be seen on the occasional piece of official merchandise: in recent years, both a resin model kit, and a bobblehead doll have been sold in their images[citation needed].<br /><br />The commercials for the cereals were memorable as it was usually a battle of the monsters when they would tout their own cereals, but would jump in sheer fright when anything interrupted their attempted one-upmanship of one another.<br /><br />Source:&nbsp; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mills_monster-themed_breakfast_cereals

				Ever have an Easy-Bake oven?&nbsp; I remember small flavorless cakes, but the real fun was not so much in the tasting, but more in the making.&nbsp; <strong>CHOW.com</strong> fast-forwards to today, and they don&#039;t think the little oven is that much fun anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;d have to question that by asking a kid.<br /><br />Easy-Bake Oven Isnâ€™t As Much Fun As it Was (http://www.chow.com/blog/2010/04/easy-bake-oven-kinda-sucks-now/)
