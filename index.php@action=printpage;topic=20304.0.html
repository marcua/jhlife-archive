				Shouldn&#039;t the City be informing restaurants to remove out door seating areas that are not enclosed and winterized.&nbsp; They no longer serve a useful purpose and are taking up parking spaces.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The worst looking one is outside of the Bamboo House on 76th St that is no longer in business.&nbsp; The owner should have removed it when he closed but didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Should it be removed by the Sanitation Department?&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a feeling that its not going to removed for a very long time.&nbsp;

				I agree, it&#039;s taking up space, they closed the restaurant. Most of the outdoor spaces are totally enclosed. I don&#039;t think that is what the city specified.

				Odd that online there is no indication that Bamboo House is closed. It says they are doing takeout and delivery. But they sure look closed for good.

Besides, people could still sit in them if they wanted.<br /><br />Restaurants aren&#039;t even getting the message from the city they need to provide adequate ventilation to fully enclose and add partitions, or reduce capacity to 25% if they only fully enclosed. It&#039;s been pretty clear restaurant owners can&#039;t be bothered to search for and read the easily found guidelines for enclosing outdoor seating nor did the city do a mailing on it. So I wouldn&#039;t count on the city to notify restaurants to take down outdoor seating platform the restaurants spent $$ on erecting when the restaurants don&#039;t have to.<br /><br />But yeah, too bad Bamboo House didn&#039;t remove their seating area if they are closed now.

				dssjh:&nbsp; Donna meant that the open outdoor dining area will get filled with garbage.&nbsp; Also, Donna&#039;s suggestion that the landlord be responsible for removing the outdoor mess is excellent.&nbsp;
