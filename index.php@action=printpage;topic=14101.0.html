				Looks like it&#039;s starting to happen:<br />https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151211/corona/flushing-meadows-corona-park-alliance-kicks-off-community-outreach<br /><br />One of the interim co-chairs of the Community Advisory Board comes from FMCP Conservancy, Jean Silva. The other, Anna Dioguardi, is an organizer for Queens Community House and a member of the Fairness Coalition <br />http://www.fmcpconservancy.org/<br /><br />They have $5 million to get started. Better than nothing, but realistically not that much. According to the story on the link below, in 2012 Flushing Meadows Corona Park was only able to raise $5,000 in private funds. At the same time, &quot;Thanks to a record-setting gift from John Paulson, the Central Park Conservancy was able to raise more than $100 million.&quot; It also says that &quot;Central Park, which is also smaller than Flushing Meadows Corona Park, has more than eight times as many workers.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/02/7883972/flushing-meadows-corona-park-lots-land-little-upkeep?--bucket-image<br /><br />I wonder how one can go about raising money for a park in a neighborhood that that&#039;s not as wealthy. Even here, the little Travers Park. I wonder if there could be a way for the coops (corporations after all) to tip in for its upkeep.<br /><br />

				I guess my questions are: do you think that a coordination of the co-ops in this area could be a good way to raise money for Travers upkeep? Either thru annual drives or, say, a $2 monthly fee added to your building&#039;s maintenance that would be redirected to the park? Do you think that&#039;s even nevessary?

A neighborhood &quot;co-op,&quot; of sorts, to benefit Travers.

				An annual fundraising is a good idea and should probably be done. I agree that my question could be a hard sell on many co-ops. I wanted to check the feasibility of creating a steady source of income for the park, similar to what is done by businesses associations in wealthier neighborhoods. This post was just meant to gauge interest. Given the lack of comments, I am concluding that the interest is tiny. :-)<br /><br />Does anyone know if there&#039;s an email list or other type of communication forum for co-op boards in the neighborhood?

				Today I happened to be in Flushing Meadow Park.<br /><br />It is so neglected I had to leave quickly because it made me sad simply being there.<br /><br />Litter everywhere and a general unkempt appearance prevailed.<br /><br />I have been to parks in the Bronx, Staten Island, Brooklyn and Manhattan and ours in Queens is definitely the worst by a mile.<br /><br />I believe the only solution is to give the park back to the people. Divide it into lots/sections and allow folks to create a network of community gardens.&nbsp; Hell, even growing onions would look better than what&#039;s there now.<br /><br />Community gardens beautified the lower east side when vacant blocks were a blight there. <br /><br />The city and Queens Council have failed in their duty to care for this park. <br /><br />That&#039;s obvious...when you&#039;re there. Go. You&#039;ll see what I mean.<br /><br />It&#039;s time to admit their incompetence and allow the people of Queens to take over. <br /><br />
