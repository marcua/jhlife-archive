				Sometimes things are so blindingly obvious that they can be hard to see.&nbsp; Perhaps that&#039;s why this Jackson Heights community forum didn&#039;t have a thread on Colombian restaurants until two weeks ago, and hasn&#039;t had a thread on South Asian restaurants until right now!&nbsp; There are existing threads for Talk of the Town (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1164.0), Deshi Biryani (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=356.0), Dosa Place (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=571.0), and food from the Himalayan region (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=546.0).&nbsp; But no place for general discussion of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi restaurants.<br /><br />What are your favorites?&nbsp; <br />

				Spicy Mina&#039;s is by far my favorite, and Mina, the chef and owner is a sweet and generous person. There have been a lot of write ups about it on Chowhound.com.

				Hands down, Delhi Palace.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am a regular there every Saturday for lunch buffet, so trust me when I say this.&nbsp; The Aloo Gobi from there is the only place, Indian or Non (Naan?&nbsp; Ha ha), that I can eat cauliflower.&nbsp; The Chili Chicken.&nbsp; Even staples like Goat Curry.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in Jackson Diner (even when it w s in its old, pre-large location), and the others (the Purple jacket place whose name I cant recall, for example), but hands down for me, Delhi Palace.<br /><br />I&#039;m either there with my son, or now he began music classes again, reading most Saturdays, so trust that I practice what I preach ... its that good.<br /><br />

				wow, you&#039;re right.&nbsp; we&#039;ve written about favorite restaurants and they came up but not a thread devoted to just this cuisine.<br /><br />This second, I&#039;m saying Nanking.&nbsp; But I still love Jackson Diner&#039;s buffet and their Tandoor Prawns for dinner.&nbsp; Have yet to get to Spicy Mina (been meaning to) and Delhi Palace never won me over although I have friends who do like it better than Jackson Diner. It&#039;s been years though and I should check out Delhi Palace again.&nbsp; But Jackson Diner makes the only creamed spinach that I&#039;ll eat so that&#039;s part of why I keep going back.&nbsp; Kinda like Really4Rob and his cauliflower craving at Delhi Palace.

				I like Delhi Palace better than Jackson Diner too. Delicious bindi masala and cauliflower, and good desserts too. The people there are always friendly and there&#039;s fresh masala dosa! I&#039;ve been wanting to try out Indian Taj as well.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also eaten at a lot of the smaller ones, whose names I can&#039;t remember. Shaheen Mahal, the 24 hour place on 74th street, has awesome aloo parathas after 11pm (I&#039;ve been told repeatedly to only come after 11pm for the aloo paratha! Don&#039;t know how different it is pre-11pm). The other 24h place next to the 7 train entrance on 74th St has surprisingly good and spicy (and cheap) chicken kebabs - only $1.50. I&#039;ve eaten at Roti Boti but I&#039;m not very fond of it - it seems outrageously pricey compared to the rest of the neighborhood.<br /><br />There was once another restaurant on 74th St that had good $1 chai. You have to ascend some steps to get there...it&#039;s now another jewelry store, sigh.<br /><br />Oh, and how can I forget Dosa Diner...quick cheap snack! (Yes, I think of dosas as snacks...)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t really tried the Indian sweets. I don&#039;t know what to get, though I&#039;ve tried some kulfi and some of the chaat.

				Bloomberg.com has a timely story (and a positive spin!) about Indian food in Jackson Heights that appears on the web site.&nbsp; Looks like our nabe has entered the big leagues!&nbsp; I&#039;m sure all the &quot;hedge fund boys and girls&quot;, investment bankers, and Wall Street types that read Bloomberg will be lined up outside Jackson Diner VERY SOON!:<br /><br /><em>In the Heights (Jackson) New Yorkers Find Down-Home Indian Food <br /><br />Review by John Mariani<br /><br />June 30 (Bloomberg) -- While Manhattan may have the most refined -- and pricey -- Indian restaurants in New York, (see Dawat, Tamarind and Chola), some of the best down-home cooking from the subcontinent can be found in an eight-block area across the Queensborough Bridge in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />They don&#039;t call it ``Little India&#039;&#039; for nothing. </em> <br /><br />Check it out here at:<br /><br />http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601093&amp;sid=aH1C.Na73pdY&amp;refer=home<br /><br />

				My fave is Indian Taj.&nbsp; Their quality is consistent and they have the buffet for dinner - sold!&nbsp; My other favorite was Ashoka but they&#039;ve since closed.&nbsp; For normal a la carte, I&#039;m in love with Deshi Biryani on 37th Ave between 75th and 76th.&nbsp; &nbsp;The four or five dishes I tried were all amazing- definitely cooked with pride and spicey as heck!&nbsp; I&#039;m agreement with the opinions on Jackson Diner.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the appeal, except if you have out of town guests who would balk at eating in hole-in-the-wall places (the good majority of restaurants here).

				I like Indian food and went to the Dehli Palace alot to buy the Simosas (sp?).&nbsp; One time with my cousins visiting we went to eat there and sat at a table.&nbsp; I went to the rest Room and witnessed two of the waiters in the bathroom.&nbsp; They both left the bathroom without washing their hands.&nbsp; I never went back, not even for the Simosas take-out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pity..I love Simosas.<br /><br />I&#039;m not picking only on Dehli Palace.&nbsp; The company I work for has many consultants from India.&nbsp; I witness the same thing at work all the time.&nbsp; I always make sure I use a paper towel when I open the faucets and when I leave the Rest Room.

				I haven&#039;t tried any of the buffets yet, and I&#039;ve gone to only a handful of Indianish places in the area, but I love Kababish - right across from roti boti. So much flavor in everything. Best Indian I&#039;ve ever had - and they are open 24 hours. There are always customers in and out - it&#039;s proof how good they are. My eyes always bulge out looking at what new things they have that day.

				My favorite right now is Deshi Biryani.&nbsp; Good food and the owners are so nice.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried Delhi Palace a few times, but it&#039;s always way too salty for me.&nbsp; The last time I ordered from them I ended up throwing out most of the food.&nbsp; <br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried Nanking yet, but I plan to this weekend.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing I&#039;ve realized (sadly) since I moved to the neighborhood a few months ago is that I have the palate of a gringo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived all over the world and love all types of food, but I was shocked to find out that some of these neighborhood places are too spicy for me.&nbsp; I always thought I could handle spicy food well - it was a blow to the ego to find out how wrong I was!&nbsp;

				Cafe Drake (http://diningwithdrake.blogspot.com), hailing from Brooklyn, is determined to try all of the Indian buffets in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &quot;Feeling as fresh and dashing as a Bollywood heartthrob&quot; after a shave at Punjab Barber Shop, he reviews Delhi Palace (http://diningwithdrake.blogspot.com/2008/07/restaurant-review-delhi-palace.html).&nbsp; I&#039;ll watch for further installments in the series.

				Haha, Cafe Drake is funny. What a culinary undertaking!<br /><br />Has anyone spoken to the owners of Tandoori Palace, the new restaurant that took over Ashoka&#039;s spot on 37th Ave? I was walking home around 1am last night and saw them in full force painting the front. Looks like they&#039;ll be open really soon.

				Just a hunch, but I don&#039;t think this is for real.&nbsp; There was a film crew out front today, and the place was abuzz with activity, so I suspect this is just a set for 7 to the Palace (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1238.0).&nbsp; It would be great if somebody could snap a picture of this storefront before it disappears!

				Perhaps what I saw this morning was the filming of a commercial for the new restaurant.<br /><br />But given that the film is described as a &quot;Tandoori comedy,&quot; and the name of the film is &quot;7 to the Palace,&quot; it seems like a safe bet that the restaurant in the movie is Tandoori Palace.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that the <span class="bbc_u">real</span> restaurant will appear after the film shoot is over.&nbsp; But maybe they&#039;ll keep the colorful new signage and just adopt that as their name, which wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea if this is a successful film.<br /><br />FYI, here&#039;s the description of the film from MovieTome (http://www.movietome.com/movie/366328/7-to-the-palace/index.html):&nbsp; &quot;A heartwarming New York style Tandoori comedy. Samir is a talented cook who dreams of being a great French Chef, but when he is forced to abandon his dream and run his fathers Indian restaurant in Jackson Heights, his life is forever changed. Learning the alchemy of Indian cuisine from a mystical larger than life immigrant cab driver, Samir manages to heal himself and his family, fall in love and turn a dreary run down greasy spoon restaurant into one of New York&#039;s most talked about eateries. &quot;7 To The Palace&quot; is about food, family, love, magic and New York.&quot;<br /><br />Update: here are some renderings of the awning design (http://www.flickr.com/photos/7ttp/sets/72157605951714677/)

I have not eaten at Pakora since it was Khan Baba, and I was not impressed. For such a large place, the selection seems even tinier now as I peer through the window. I read online Kabab King had a self-serve buffet upstairs, and the upper level has been closed since I moved into the neighborhood, but just recently I saw the lights on upstairs so I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Ugh, now I&#8217;m hungry. <strong>Jeff</strong>, don&#8217;t forget me either.

				Several years ago, Kebab King did have an upstairs buffet.&nbsp; The food was much spicier than the others in the neighborhood.&nbsp; At the time, I thought it was the second-best around, second only to Bombay Harbour, which has since closed.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s also Roti Boti, which I haven&#039;t tried.<br /><br />And yes, I&#039;m also excited about the arrival of Delhi Heights and Mehfil!

				well, if you live here you can go anytime you want. the more you go the more you will learn about it. <br /><br />I am pretty sure delhi palace has buffet that day. I think nearly all have them every day for lunch. it seems like only kebab king is shady with closing their buffet area. I mean, theres signs out front saying buffet...<br />I went to al-naimet today. I thought it was really good. there werent many people in there though unfortunately. there were some great items and some not as good. but i was really happy. the biryani rocked and i had some new things. they are pakistani for the most part. <br /><br />i think there might be a science to buffet eating. like 1pm is probably the best time to go. freshest stuff.

				There&#039;s definitely a lunch buffet at Delhi Palace. I go there all the time! And remember to order the masala dosa - they make it fresh, so it&#039;s not on the buffet tables. It&#039;s included in the price.<br /><br />Try everything in the vegetarian section and save room for dessert. It&#039;s always delicious.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can&#039;t make this (Restaurant Week in Manhattan beckons!) but will try to meet up at some other buffet outing. Maybe Indian Taj!

				Have fun today!<br /><br />Jim Leff, the founder of Chowhound, writes in his blog to defend Spicy Mina from critics who complain about inconsistency (http://jimleff.blogspot.com/2008/07/consistency-niche-and-artbiz-dichotomy.html).&nbsp; I completely agree with him.&nbsp; Spicy Mina is a gem, and some variation from visit to visit is a small price to pay for Mina&#039;s genuinely distinct and wonderful flavors.

				So guess who was waiting outside Delhi Palace at 1pm today??? elyaqim!&nbsp; Hurray.&nbsp; He recovered and realized that the best thing for an upset stomach, was in fact Indian food.&nbsp; jeffsayyes came right after.<br /><br />The three of us walked in and the place was empty.&nbsp; I can understand why elyaqim didn&#039;t think they had a lunch buffet cuz it was no where to be seen.&nbsp; But it was there ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK CORNER.&nbsp; It was tiny.&nbsp; And didn&#039;t have a great selection.&nbsp; So I was forced to eat dishes I might not ordinarily try out of possible hunger from lack of choices.<br /><br />So here&#039;s the skinny: food: so-so.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed that people think this place has better food than Jackson Diner.&nbsp; OMG, no way.&nbsp; Not only is the Jackson Diner lunch buffet twice the size, it has better tasting food AND because of the large numbers of people eating at Jackson Diner, their buffet is constantly being replenished.&nbsp; Delhi Palace, being empty, might have had their food sitting in those trays since 11am!!!!<br /><br />There were two dishes I did like at Delhi Palace: a cauliflower/spinach spicy one and some vegetable dish that you put on toasted, crusty bread like a dinner roll, not nan.&nbsp; Odd but tasty.<br /><br />There was nothing odd about the company.&nbsp; Great guys.&nbsp; Enjoyable conversation.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to the next get together.

				I&#039;m surprised and disappointed by your experience at Delhi Palace.&nbsp; When I&#039;ve been there (always on weekends, most recently over a year ago), I have found the buffet to have at least as many options as Jackson Diner, and the food generally comparable (with better vegetarian selections).&nbsp; <br /><br />But it&#039;s been a while, and it&#039;s entirely possible that the quality of their buffet has declined (although I know the restaurant remains excellent for take-out and delivery, since this is where I usually order from).&nbsp; Or it may just be a matter of an insufficient crowd on weekdays.&nbsp; More research needed!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				I&#039;m surprised too. Delhi Palace has always been good - not superlative, but good, tasty food and the vegetarian options and biryani have always been better and more interesting than at Jackson Diner (they even served some kind of mushroom saag once!). I&#039;ve not tried the buffet at Jackson Diner but I&#039;ve ordered off the menu, and the bhindi masala was an oily, gloppy mess and the saag paneer very bland and average. Wasn&#039;t too impressed. Maybe I have to go back and try the JD buffet (which, I must say, isn&#039;t all that much more crowded than DP on a weekday lunch), however I do feel that JD has been dumbed down a lot.<br /><br />This weekend I had a really good lunch buffet at Nanking Express. It&#039;s only available on weekends from about 12.30 to 4pm. It&#039;s a mix of your usual Indian buffet standards (butter chicken, rogan josh, etc) and some Indian-Chinese dishes such as the chilli chicken. They also have some interesting dishes on the buffet line - kurkuri bhindi (crispy okra, almost like french fries!), eggplant, Manchurian chicken, etc. And best of all, mango lassi and a choice of dessert (you pick) are included in the buffet price! I had a really good gajar halwa but you can also choose to have mango or rose ice cream and gulab jamum...<br /><br />In other news, &quot;Tandoori Palace&quot; appears to have been replaced by its more permanent facade - can&#039;t remember the name, sounds like Tadakil Kitchen or something - but it virtually went up overnight!

				Delhi Palace has always been good to me. We&#039;ve only had he buffet once though, and I have to agree with Buddy. There was not much choice of things I would normally eat. We order take-out/delivery from them alot though and we&#039;ve never been disappointed. Perhaps the moral is to not get their buffet, but order off the menu.<br /><br />Jackson Diner just really turns me off. It&#039;s over priced, the staff is rude and the service isn&#039;t that great.

The prices are regular indian manhattan prices (11-20), which is totally fair for what they seem to offer. <br /><br />I was very impressed. Seems refined, clean, and like they care.

				The Village Voice reviews Delhi Heights.&nbsp; In sum... thumbs down on the South Indian portion of the menu, &quot;very good&quot; but not great Indian, and thumbs up for the Indian-Chinese.<br /><br />The Village Voice<br /><strong>A Manchurian Candy Date in Delhi Heights (http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-09-17/restaurants/a-manchurian-candy-date-in-delhi-heights/)</strong><br />Jackson Heights rouses itself from a long slumber<br />By Robert Sietsema<br />Tuesday, September 16th 2008 at 02:29pm<br /><br />Dominated by all-you-can-eat buffets and halal-kebab joints, the Indian-restaurant scene in Jackson Heights was moribund for a decade. Then Delhi Heights appeared. Located a samosa&#039;s throw from the massive aboveground subway station, the new restaurant&#039;s over-the-top glitz was immediately apparent, causing commuters to stop and gawk in astonishment at the spaceship-size chandeliers, undulant orange banquettes, and Spam-colored granite bar that actually serves cocktails, making the place more like Vegas than Varanasi. Clad in white shirts and black ties, the waiters float among the diners like ghosts of Indian restaurants past.<br /><br />(follow link for complete review)

				I think he&#039;s reflecting the new conventional wisdom (as least from what I&#039;ve heard) that JH no longer represents the best South Asian cuisine in the city.&nbsp; Richmond Hill in Queens, Lexington Ave. in Manhattan, and even the once-ridiculed 6th Street in Manhattan all have places with more exciting offerings, while the JH scene remained the same for several years.&nbsp; Until recently.&nbsp; Now we have new ethnic groups moving in, bringing a new crop of restaurants.&nbsp; I can see why for foodies outside the neighborhood, it&#039;s a reason to declare JH suddenly interesting again.

				The restaurants they are a-changinâ€™. Both Roti Boti restaurants are changing their name, so it appears. The northern Roti Boti, the one with the Shaheen dessert counter, has already transformed into <em>Dera</em>. The southern one is still displaying Roti Boti signage, but appears to be transforming into <em>Karahi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karahi)</em>. My adored Nanking has been closed a few consecutive days now, so weâ€™ll see what changes have occurred when and if they reopen. Himalayan Fast Food is temporarily closed, a typeset sign saying for health violations, a handwritten sign saying for renovations. And Top of the World Buffet has transformed, not for the better in my opinion, into <em>Potala (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potala_Palace) Buffet</em>. (I know this is not a Himalayan thread, but I could not find a better one.)

				I recently tried the new Indian restaurant (forgot the name) on 37th Ave between 76 and 77 Streets (Old Baskin Robbins) and I was very impressed - and THEY DELIVER! It is very clean and the ambiance is great - a little American with booths and all but I won&#039;t let that distract me too much. I strongly recommend it - however I was there in the evening for dinner and have not tried the buffet they have during the day so I cannot comment on that. But aside from that one I like Indian Taj and the Jackson Diner is very good too on Sundays for buffet they are great!<br /><br />One side note - the Afghani Kebab House is great - slightly pricy but delicious!

				The name of the new Indian restaurant on 37th Ave betw 76th and 77th is Mehfil (see thread below this one). My wife and I were there last night, and it continues to impress. We got our regular Shahajani Pullao, and tried the Bhindi Masala, which was equally delicious. Mehfilâ€™s kheer dessert is our favorite of all our JH standbys.

				It seems another will be opening soon. 71-06 37<sup>th</sup> Avenue, the former location of Chinese Mirch Masala, and with a minor change to the awning later became Chinese <em>Mixed</em> Masala, has been vacant since I moved in a year ago, but now has a new awning. The new place will not be called <em>Nanking</em> and will not be called <em>Kabab King</em>, but instead will have the name <em>Naan Kabob Food Restaurant</em>. The awning promises â€œIndo Pak Bangladesh Nepal Tibetan Chinese Thaiâ€ cuisine, quite the cavalcade of options. This is all on the left (east) side of the awning; the right (west) side has Bangla text that reads something like <em>Paykari mach bazar</em> [Wholesale fish market] / <em>Halal meat and grocery</em>, with English text underneath saying â€œIndo Pak Bangladesh halal meat &amp; fish grocery.â€ I presume there will be a market and a restaurant sharing a storefront, not unlike Dhaka Kabab and Haat Bazaar on 73<sup>rd</sup> Street. Itâ€™ll never top Nanking Express, but I can hardly wait to try it.

				And another one! I saw the sign go up today on the heretofore unoccupied building at 37-22 73<sup>rd</sup> Street. Itâ€™ll be called <em>Khaabar Baari</em> (â€œFood Houseâ€ in Bangla), confusingly located in the building right next door to the market <em>Khaamar Baari</em> (â€œFarm Houseâ€). Here (http://nyc.everyblock.com/sign-permits/by-date/2009/1/9/1918519/) is their sign permit approval.
