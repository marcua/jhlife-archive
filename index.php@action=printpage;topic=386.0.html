				With all the great restaurants around, but the cost sometimes prohibitive, how often do you (and spouse and/or children) eat out. I don&#039;t mean the snack in the mornings, or the quick lunch, I mean the sit down restaurant meal or the full meal take-out.

				Probably about 2 nights/week.&nbsp; There are so many tempting choices in JH!&nbsp; Unfortunately, with little kids at home, we&#039;re somewhat limited to what&#039;s available by delivery.

				<strong>Hey Mac<br /><br />Maybe you can change the survey thingy a bit.&nbsp; I was forced and manipulated into clicking 2 - 3 times weekly&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp;My other choice would have been every night but that would be an exaggeration&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; How about 4-5 times weekly and almost every evening...etc.&nbsp; Does eating lunch count&nbsp; (I mean in a sit down restaurant, not a fast food joint)&nbsp; Does breakfast count?&nbsp; Please MAC, can you please clarify...I am stressed about his question.&nbsp; I hate taking surveys due to this very reason...l :tickedoff:&nbsp; What if someone eats lunch in a sit down restaurant every day and dinner 3 times weekly?&nbsp; &nbsp;:D</strong>

				I wish I could eat out more. There aren&#039;t enough meals in the day... Costs aren&#039;t too prohibitive. especially for lunch. once you start with drinks, then it adds up.

				We&#039;ve cut down on eating out ever since the economy tanked.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t feel right even though we haven&#039;t been affected- kind of a weird form of survivor&#039;s guilt ???&nbsp; Now we&#039;re down to once a week and we try to make it cheap like Indian nearby, rather than dinner in Manhattan.&nbsp;

				NYC Native, that is a very good point to make.&nbsp; I feel hubby and I should be cutting back on overall spending anyway, so the bad economy is a good excuse for us to do so.&nbsp; The upside is that this compels us to explore our food options more in this neighborhood- there are so many non-Indian restaurants we still haven&#039;t tried yet!

				I look at it a little differently too... If you lost money in the market, think about all the great meals you could have had with that money! and now look what you have to show for it. Money comes and goes. Food does too. but food tastes better.

				To be fair, my vote of eat out includes our often used &quot;order in&quot; method.<br /><br />My son, when 2, actually knew our address by heart (and would say &quot;apartment 2E like elephant&quot;) because of overhearing the way Daddy &#039;made&#039; Wonton soup and Spare Ribs (the New Peking way).

				I eat out more than I eat in.&nbsp; But that includes take out.&nbsp; Usually one meal a day, sometimes two is eaten out.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a fan of cooking my own food, sad to say.
