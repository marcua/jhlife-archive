					My son took a photo of a Hawk that had a recently killed pigeon in its claws. The picture was taken on 37th Avenue around 83rd or 84th Street a few weeks ago. Has anyone else seen this magnificent bird? Is it likely to become a permanent resident? Can we encourage it to move on to squirrels?<br /><br />(With any luck I will post the picture)

					<br />I can&#039;t remember at what age I joined the scouts-I guess I was around&nbsp; 11(1954?). The troop meetings were in the evening and involved all the patrols lining up to be addressed by the Scoutmaster who I think was called Mr. K. the K being short for a longer name that might have been something harder to pronounce.The ceremonial aspects of scouting have faded to some extent although the Scoutmaster&#039;s parting benediction to us all at the end of the evening for some reason and after all these years remains&quot;May the Great Scoutmaster of all good scouts look after thee and me until we meet again. Troop attention!&quot; I think that&#039;s a rough approximation.<br /><br />The bonus for all that was the end of evening game of Russian Bulldog-great fun that was too. Finally the walk home to 72nd street and the peeking in at the mysterious Blue Haven, Jackson Heights&#039;only and now last night club.<br /><br />My patrol leader was by the way Brad Jayner -why I still remember his name after what feels like a millennial age ago is an open question and one that confounds me.It is in any event now part of my own treasury of Happy Days in the old Jackson heights.

					Thanks for this picture of Fields Department store. I remember the day I got my boy scout uniform there and became a proud member of the troop based at P.S.69. I never rose above 1st class scout level and can&#039;t recall any of the knots we had to learn but I do have very fond memories of the cobra patrol that I was part of.

					Is there any possibility of restoring the wonderful Peppino Mangravite mural in the Post Office. It has been there since 1940 and deserves some kind of recognition and a good cleaning if that is possible. I would suggest that in the interests of making the re-naming of the Post Office a more interesting deliberation that Mangravite, an Italian immigrant artist who spent many long hours painting the mural in our Post Office should also be considered for this honor.

					ABC had a big footprint on 82nd Street and its departure leaves a gaping hole in the central business district of our community. I only occasionally shopped there so it is not an irreplaceable loss for me. What does worry me is the number of closed down stores in the area. It is beginning to feel that businesses are simply not sustainable except for banks and drugstores. I hope that a revived Bruson building might be the spark that re-generates a viable commercial life in Jackson Heights(any news on that front?) until then it feels like all we need are some tumble weeds and a few urban coyotes to complete the picture.

					<br />I started using this place after Kabab King had health violations. I always wondered why there was no letter grade showing for their health status but I perhaps naively hoped for the best. I dread to think what those violations might be even more so since I ate there a few weeks ago. <br /><br />Maybe the meeting on Diversity Plaza tomorrow can address the larger issues of making sure our restaurant food is clean. The environment of 74th Street also needs to be attended to as it is more often than not just a dirty garbage strewn mess.

					<br /><br />Thank you Citizen for confirming an ancient recollection to be true. Did the the Ebay photo give the address? Having the Whitey Ford connection to JH proved I am feeling more confident that my locating him on 71st Street was correct. In those days living on 72nd Street as I did, I really wasn&#039;t allowed to wander very much further than 74th Street on the upside and the&quot; lots &quot;(open fields just beyond what is now Legends bar) to 37th Ave. I was probably only 7 or 8 back in those Whitey days.<br /><br />So 71st is what I remember and I am sticking with it.

					Just a slight correction to the Whitey Ford reference. It was 71st and 37th where I believe he lived. The reason I think he lived there was that I like a lot of other Jackson Heights kids went trick or treating in those dear old innocent days and rumor had it that Whitey lived there. My love for the Yankees is limitless so either I knocked on the Ford household door and was met by a little girl who shouted &quot;Whitey there&#039;s another one&quot; or it was all a Yankee-inspired dream that remains in the never-never land of truth and fiction.<br /><br />What is absolutely true is that I shook Yogi Berra&#039;s hand when he opened his diner called the Dugout on the corner of 74th Street and 37th Avenue(now a sort of bedraggled pizza joint) back in the 50&#039;s.I was one of the 100s of kids who surrounded Yogi as he got out of black limo to make a dash into his place which I don&#039;t think lasted very long. In those days most of the kids I knew were Giants&#039; fans as presumably were their parents.

					One of the academic stars at JHS 145&nbsp; back in the 50&#039;s was Nikki Yerby who was the daughter of Frank Yerby. I am not sure if his work is read very much anymore but he wrote about the antebellum days of plantations and slavery but without any of the racial stereotyping of other authors. He was the first African-American author to be generally popular as far as I know. His Wikipedia entry says he left America in 1955 to live for the rest of his life in Spain. Presumably that&#039;s when his daughter left the school and the country. The film &quot;the Foxes of Harrow&quot; was I think the only one his novels made into a movie.<br /><br />The Oscar winning composer Red Evans whose list of hits is endless(Silver Bells,Mona Lisa,Too Young, Que Sera Sera,etc,etc.) lived on on 73rd Street and his son Tommy was someone I knew. They were certainly around for a good part of the 50s however I am not sure how long they stayed beyond 1956<br />.<br />The fighter Tony Canzoneri lived in JH and I remember seeing him walking to the subway. He was a very well known fighter in the thirties and also beat Marlon Brando up in the finale of On the Waterfront. <br /><br />The rest of my recollections might be flawed and certainly you would have to be&nbsp; on Medicare to remember some of these names. Dorothy Collins and Raymond Scott of Your Hit parade I think lived in JH<br /><br />Dr Harry Cagney.Jimmy&#039;s brother,had a practise in JH and I think lived here as well (not sure of that).<br /><br />This might be something I dreamed up but I recollect that Whitey Ford lived on 71st Street and 35th for a brief time. I think Mel Allen lived in JH as well briefly but that might be apocryphal.<br /><br />The principal of PS 69 when I went there was Mr. Jaffe whose daughter was Rona Jaffe who wrote romantic novels in the 50s one of which was made into a film(The Best of Everything) <br />&nbsp;<br />Helen Kane who someone else mentioned lived in the Berkeley on 35th Avenue. She had retired many years ago but was remembered as the inspiration for Betty Boop she being the original Boop a doop girl. She even appeared in a film with Cary Grant. I remember seeing her occasionally with her husband . She died in JH where she had lived for many years.<br />I am not sure if all of these names qualify as famous but they added something to the interesting history this community has had

					The link to the article on the vendors of Roosevelt Avenue is worth looking at for a number of reasons. There is a vitality to the photos that is in its way like a gentle stroll up the Avenue on a sunny afternoon. The text that accompanies it however is written in the leaden sociological style that is a form of verbal strutting - just another form of showing off. <br /><br /><br />The authors should read George Orwell&#039;s essay&nbsp; &quot;Politics and the English language&quot;&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a>) that despite being written in 1946 is still the best antidote to this kind of academic obscurantism.

					The topic with the byline &quot;I&#039;m happy I finally registered &quot; is generating trojan and virus alerts on my computer. I use Kaspersky by the way. Is anyone else getting that? Does Jackson Heights Life have an anti-virus screen for messages?

					Just to add to the chorus of approval for this place. We tried their recommended dishes that is the cucumber, the shredded fish and the Young Chow rice and something else that I can&#039;t recall. We liked all the dishes-they were unlike most of the take out places certainly better than our local place. We will definitely try them again. BTW the delivery time was just as good as the food.

					I am a regular user of this station both the subway and the 7 line.This is the hub station for Jackson Heights yet it seems to be festering in neglect. The subway lines are always foul and dirty, a perfect environment for the ever larger rats that have made this station their special preserve. The walls are dirty, the stairs leading out of the station on 37th road are nearly always covered in litter. Recently the elevator to the 7 train has been stopping on the platform with the doors not opening for 30 seconds enough time for anyone with the slightest bit of anxiety to start wondering how long a response might take after pressing the alarm button.<br /><br />Does the community have any access to the station manager on a regular basis? Only regular and frequent accountability to users of the service can there be any hope of turning around this disgraceful situation.

					We went to the new Arunee last weekend.We liked the improvements -certainly the old Arunee was cramped and in need of modernizing. This new place is tastefully decorated and feels more like a Manhattan restaurant in some ways. The verdict is still out on how well it will stand up against Sriprapha ,Zabb or Ayada. My last meal at Sri was on a balmy summer night and we ate in the garden. The food was excellent. So for a neighborhood place this is fine and I would certainly go back but I&#039;m not sure how it compares. <br /><br />Decor by the way is no big deal for me . I love Deera which doesn&#039;t take it itself too seriously and serves up massive portions to what appears to be a very savvy clientele.&nbsp;

					I think that film The Naked City(1948) should be added to the list. I haven&#039;t seen it in a while but I do remember a scene that I am sure was roughly in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The film itself is very good with a gritty location feel that is capped with an exciting chase finale on the Williamsburg Bridge. There are also some sequences on the subway which show some kind of pot bellied stoves near the turnstiles. Directed by Jules Dassin,written by Albert Maltz both in their final innings before the blacklist took them down.
