				Found this over on the Astorian site. Since I have go to the Upper Eastside 4 my favorite Wine Bar, I&#039;m excited that one is opening up closer to home. I edited it to make it shorter since the poster talks about the Astorian site a bit.<br /><br />Hi Astorians my name is Richard and my partners and I wanted to introduce ourselves to the community board.&nbsp; ....We are three wine enthusiasts and our motivation from the beginning was to build a beautiful wine bar with wonderful food that would truly become a homebase to all members of the community.&nbsp; ... The name came from a definition in the urban dictionary, it goes as follows: &quot; The sensation of Euphoria over finding and experiencing the perfect bottle of wine, sought after for its region, make, or price. reveling in its first taste, while appreciating its rarity leading to a moment of pure bliss.&quot;&nbsp; So in short it&#039;s just a name and the interior is actually, at least we feel, really beautiful.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have built this place from the ground up and have put so much heart into it that we hope it will show when you come and see it.&nbsp; Now about the place itself...it has a rustic feel with exposed brick walls and intricate wood work.&nbsp; The wine list is approachable yet ecclectic and the food is a tapas style menu with a French and Mediteranean influence.&nbsp; We have communal tables as well as intimate seating in order to reinforce the sense of community we were hoping for.&nbsp; We would love for everyone to come down, we are having a soft opening this Saturday (a limited menu will be available we are perfecting it) but come down for some wine and cocktails everything will be half price.&nbsp; We are really excited about this new venture in our lives and would love to share it with you.&nbsp; Thanks for your support!&nbsp; To check out the menu and winelist go to winegasmeatery.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;Richard, Laris and Dean<br /><br />The address is:<br />31-86 37th <strong>Street</strong><br />Astoria<br />bet. Broadway and 31st Ave.
