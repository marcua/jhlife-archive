				<br />My memories of Christmas in Jackson Heights in the 40s and 50s are so many and so varied that I will just have to jump right in and ask you, dear reader, join in the festivities.<br /><br />The season began when the lights went up on 74th Street and 82nd&nbsp; Street. These were special lights strung across the our two main commercial streets and how glad we children were to see them.<br /><br />Gene Autry came out with Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer in 1949 and followed with Frosty The Snowman a year later.<br /><br />The Post Office became a hub of Christmas activity. You bought Christmas seals there and mailed your Christmas packages.<br /><br />At PS 69 we decorated our windows with artificial snow.&nbsp; Mr. Ball, the kindly old custodian played Santa Claus.&nbsp; At JHS 145, Mr. Adolph led us in song for a Christmas/Hanuka festival. I can remember the songs, but I still canâ€™t spell Hanuka.<br /><br />Most apartments in the neighborhood decorated their lobbies.&nbsp; The Greystones on 80th Street had a particularly impressive display of trees and lights. Every good old bar in the neighborhood put up decorations as well, and so did the liquor stores.<br /><br />Christmas trees went on sale in parking lots, street corners, and fruit stands.&nbsp; Douglas Fir Trees were the only trees available; there were no Scotch Pines or other exotic flora to be had.<br /><br />We had bubble lights.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve we filed into Community Church for candlelight service with Doctor Karl F. Moore.&nbsp; Every year he told the story of how he tried to photograph a candle for the cover of a church bulletin -- and how all the darkness in the world couldnâ€™t extinguish the light of that single candle.<br /><br />Saint Joan Of Arc had midnight mass, and services at Saint Markâ€™s Episcopal Church were conducted by Rev. L. Roper Shamhart.<br /><br />When the holidays were over we had huge Christmas tree bonfires in the vacant lots.&nbsp; I distinctly remember some kids chanting: &quot;Hitler&#039;s house is burning down,&quot; while the trees burned.<br /><br />Merry Christmas from yesteryear.&nbsp; Do you have Christmas memories to share?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Jamaica Savings bank (on the corner of 81st and 37th) always had&nbsp; Santa Clause the 8 reindeer and Rudolph (with a lighted ed nose) flying on the roof of the bank.<br />When the holidays were over we had huge Christmas tree bonfires in the vacant lots. The best fires were built in the empty lot where the library now stands. I&#039;m surprised a lot of kids didn&#039;t get hurt from them

				When my brother owned Arts &#039;n Flowers Florist in the &#039;70&#039;s and &#039;80&#039;s, he always left the unsold Christmas trees on out Christmas eve. They were always gone the next morning.
