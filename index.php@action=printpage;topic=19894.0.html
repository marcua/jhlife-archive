				Dear neighbors and friends,<br />Many of you already know us well and those of you just get to know us, know we are minority-owned businesses and our lives depend on it. With COVID-19, it already had devastated us and all local businesses big or small in the community. With the recent dead of George Floyd, we are heartbroken

				Dear neighbors,&nbsp; <br /><br />With the opportunity from the World Central Kitchen, we are&nbsp; cooking 1500 meals to @jacksonheightsny neighborhood on a spread of over 3 days. Today, we are making 500 chicken pasta, simple, yet exquisite nutrients and taste. Thank you to our team Lorito, Mayra and volunteers. Team works = dream works. As Jose Andres said, &quot;I hope youâ€™ll dream with us as we envision a world where there is always a warm meal, an encouraging word, and a helping hand in hard times. Thank you for taking this journey with us.&quot; Thank you for having us to be a part of this journey. <br /><br />Patrick and Francisco <br /><br />Addictive Wine and Tapas Bar <br />8701 Northern Blvd<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br />347-832-0951 <br />www.addictivewinebar.com <br /><br />
