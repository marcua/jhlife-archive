			Can anyone recommend a place to donate clothes?&nbsp; These are a mix of women&#039;s, men&#039;s and teen clothes.&nbsp; Most in really good condition.&nbsp; i don&#039;t want them to go into a landfill. Thanks!

			Here are a couple you can try...<br /><br />https://locations.goodwillnynj.org/goodwill-nynj-outlet-store-and-donation-center-7180b9193423<br /><br />https://uwvcpickupservice.org/<br /><br />They should both take pretty much anything you may have.&nbsp; Hope it works out!

			I&#039;ve seen St. Mary&#039;s recommended, although haven&#039;t tried it myself. They do pickups.<br /><br />https://stmarysclothingdrive.com/stmarys/schedule<br /><br />Also, if you&#039;re on Facebook, join a &quot;Buy Nothing&quot; group. There are two for Jackson Heights - one for the east and one for west. The group you end up in depends on your home address. https://www.facebook.com/groups/235302994042958
