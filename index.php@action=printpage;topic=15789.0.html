				I noticed today there is finally some work going on in the former health food store space on 37th a few doors down from 83rd and 37th. The space has been empty for quite some time. The former Pan &amp; Mas storefront almost across the street from this space still seems to be empty.<br /><br />It looks like there will be two upcoming vacancies on the block between 84th St. and 85th St. near the current health food/organic store location. Both the florist on the corner of 85th and the small furniture store have going out of business signs on them. Not sure if anything is planned to take over yet.<br /><br />Could be an exciting year for new retail, with the new Swim Two Birds, and (fingers crossed) retail coming into the Bruson building, and also the new Old Navy on 82nd St.

				I asked the furniture guy why he&#039;s leaving. He said &quot;they want the whole building&quot; or ...the whole block,&quot; or &quot;the whole thing.&quot; He was a bit of a distance from me and he was closing up so I couldn&#039;t hear him well.<br /><br />We may lose all those small stores. Besides the furniture store and florist, what else is on that block? Kelly&#039;s (post office)?<br /><br />

				I have to sit still as I am soaking my foot, so thought I&#039;d Google Map the block. <br /><br />Aside from Downtown Market, the furniture store and the corner florist, there&#039;s Kelly&#039;s (post office) and Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, a fabric store, Josefine hair salon, and a Hispanic restaurant la Picada.

				Correct, the signs are no longer there. A little history... Kelly&#039;s Cleaners also had a going out of biz sign up a few months ago, and then it was removed. I asked about it at the time and the guy there told me that he worked it out (the lease) with the building.

				Don&#039;t be so quick to change topic on the block of 84-85 on North side of 37th. <br />Also block of 83-84 on South side. That block has 7 empty storefronts. The anchor shop is Chivito D&#039;Oro. <br /><br />It appears that whomever is in possession is trying to empty the total area. <br />Last year, during snow events they never shoveled. We called Crowley&#039;s office and he managed to get it done. <br /><br />Building owners are responsible for snow removal- that&#039;s a good time to find out who they are too.

				Alex, who owns Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, is retiring some time this year.&nbsp; So that space will be vacant.&nbsp; The landlord apparently was not letting the tenants sign leases but would go month to month.&nbsp; He wants to build up on top of what is there.&nbsp; The furniture store next to Kelly&#039;s every couple of months has a going out of business sign up.&nbsp; I guess he then works out something with the building owner.&nbsp;

				Two depressing additions to the list of small shops closing in JH. Ingrids Beauty Shop on 78th and 35th and the pizza store also on 35th between 77th and 78th. Both places had been there for some time -the pizza place had a changed ownership not too long ago. I suppose the worst outcome is that these two prime sites just get boarded up and left to rot like the store on 35th near 76th street which was supposed to be the site of a new restaurant but now just appears to be inactive. There seems so much potential in the neighborhood for new developments but we seem to only attract banks,drug stores or chain clothing outlets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Is there any indication that the political class in JH has any interest in this ?

				It is my understanding that the&nbsp; landlords in JH would rather keep stores empty if they can&#039;t get sky high rents because they can take it as a tax loss. Is there anything that can be done about this. It really keeps entrepreneurs and mom &amp; pop stores out of the neighborhood. We will become a nabe of chain stores and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what our population wants or needs. Can anyone shed light on why stores (especially restaurants and bars) can pop up in neighboring communities but seem to be shut out here. Yes I know we have many long standing restaurants but new ones seem to have a very tough time of it. Can we as a community do anything about this? Any insight appreciated.

				I agree that this is particularly prevalent in our neighborhood.<br /><br />(Commercial landlords preferring to wait for high paying tenants)<br /><br />For instance, the stores in Greenpoint, Brooklyn are maybe half/two thirds the rent of those in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />And this enables the mix of stores to be interesting.&nbsp; From Polish to Artisan and everything in between.<br /><br />The gossip I have heard is that the families who own the commercial property don&#039;t live in the neighborhood and so are not particularly interested in how the neighborhood fares.&nbsp; It&#039;s simply a cash cow managed by agents.<br /><br />What can be done?... that is a good question.<br /><br />Maybe the city can be picketed to impose a tax on empty storefronts?<br /><br />With the tax increasing the longer the store-front is empty.<br /><br />...But in truth, that sort of a law sounds like it might be tough to pass. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve said this before and I&#039;ll say it again.<br /><br />It is very hard to explain the range of rent demands on 37th Avenue, some of which are self-evidently reasonable for the area and some of which rival the most expensive rents in Manhattan per square foot, as just the market at work.

				Here&#039;s a question--can some of these rules be changed by our own city council?&nbsp; Can they be changed locally?&nbsp; Can there be some kind of incentive program for new businesses and locally run companies and/or penalties and taxes for keeping storefronts vacant?&nbsp; Is this something that can come from and be initiated by Danny Dromm and Jose Peralta?&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to believe that vacant buildings and anonymous chains have to be such a big part of our very awesome neighborhood.

				Finally a logical explanation for what certainly always looked like some mysterious scam.<br /><br />THANK YOU<br /><br />And so the bank sells off the loans as AAA just like they sold the sub prime mortgage loans as AAA. When they aren&#039;t .<br /><br />And commercial rents in our neighborhood are definitely not worth what is being asked. <br /><br />Reality is that the properties are being overvalued to rort the system.<br /><br />This is just like the sub prime fiasco 10 years ago. Only this time with commercial landlords. <br /><br />This explains why some store owners pay far less rent.<br /><br />My guess is the landlord pretends they pay more. In order to create the illusion the property is worth far more than it is worth. <br /><br />Very imaginative scam. That will eventually come crashing down. As all scams do.<br />Because the valuations are false.<br /><br />As for the neighborhood...it is left behind completely in this scam. <br /><br /><br />

				The solution at the end of the Daily News article seems like a no-brainer:&nbsp; &quot;phasing out of tax deductions for landlords with persistent vacancies.&quot;&nbsp; Does anyone know if this simple idea has ever been seriously considered and/or proposed in the City Council or the state legislature? It makes sense not only for neighborhoods like ours, but because the public sector needs tax revenues. I couldn&#039;t find any reference to it on Google (admittedly didn&#039;t look too hard).<br />

				From what I figure it&#039;s not only tax deductions...the&nbsp; landlords are after...<br /><br />It&#039;s the inflated (false) values of the buildings to use as collateral in order to get loans to invest in high yield ventures.<br /><br />Thinking about it...I suppose that this practice might stop naturally as soon as interest rates go up...<br /><br />Interest rates for loans are historically low...and I imagine that can&#039;t last forever... <br /><br />The scam is really a function of low interest loans that are readily available these days (and have been since the Recession) <br /><br />So there might be some cessation of the racket in the future...when interest rates go back up...<br />

				i made my monthly (ish) trek to Sorisso this morning, and decided, on a whim, to walk down Steinway instead of getting off at 46th as i usually do.<br /><br />i lived in Astoria from the very end of 1989 until the very end of 1996, and i&#039;ve never seen it look as much like a ghost town as it does. since i saw two back to back vacant storefronts as soon as i turned from Broadway - the former Claire&#039;s and a leather store - i decided to count. <br /><br />Steinway between B&#039;way and 31st avenue: 8 vacant storefronts, mostly large ones.<br />Steinway between 31st and 30th avenue: 18 vacant storefronts. Eighteen.<br /><br />what&#039;s left is mostly national chains, big name fast food and banks. the locally owned stuff is almost all gone. this could be our future if things keep going the way they are.

				I used to live in Astoria early 80s and remember Steinway always seemed plagued by empty storefronts (though I never counted them). I do recall once seeing a fairly small storefront advertising &quot;going out of business sale&quot; in one window and &quot;grand opening sale&quot; in the other!

				well, i turned the corner onto 30th and there were six more between steinway and Sorriso (at 44th). that&#039;s 32 vacant storefronts in roughly the distance between 74th and 86th, 37th and roosevelt. i don&#039;t think we&#039;re quite that dire.

				My evening walk got me wondering... <br />While 82nd Street has turned into a mall (Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Sketchers, Foot Locker, GNC, Children&#039;s Place plus national chain fast food, banks and cell phone stores... even Target soon) it&#039;s sad to see some prime spots on 37th Avenue remain empty for months.&nbsp; No, make that YEARS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ingrid&#039;s old hair salon at 79th Street.&nbsp; The Gothic furniture shop at 83rd Street both spring to mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe the new strategy should be to start calling out commercial landlords for allowing their property to linger in a semi-abandoned state. <br /><br />So who owns that Ingrid&#039;s space you ask? The NYC website points to a company called CAIMAN REALTY LLC&nbsp; ( see how much they pay in taxes HERE: http://webapps.nyc.gov:8084/CICS/f704/f403001I?BBL=4-01278-0038- ) <br />While real estate filings are pretty complicated with various holding companies, it looks like it&#039;s the same company that is also the owner of what also seems to be a pretty vacant building on 75th Street.&nbsp; ( http://tinyurl.com/y865yrt3 ) as well as some other properties in JH.&nbsp; No surprise here.. but it also looks like the person at the head of the company lives on Long Island, not JH. <br /><br />It&#039;s a well kept commercial building, to give credit where it&#039;s due. And I get that landlords are taking write-offs to pad their tax losses... but for the neighborhood&#039;s sake they should do something with them in the meantime.&nbsp; Imagine if Ingrid&#039;s were gallery of JH artists until a new store rented it.&nbsp; Heck, you could even hang art in the window and keep the doors locked and it would be less of a blight.&nbsp; There are probably lots of other ideas such as renting as a &quot;pop up&quot; store for the holiday season coming up.&nbsp; &nbsp;It may even raise the value of the property and others you may own in the neighborhood!<br /><br />Landlords aren&#039;t the enemy.&nbsp; If you think about it, they&#039;re for better or worse part of what makes any neighborhood what it is.&nbsp; So come on landlords, think of the community.&nbsp; Better yet, lower your rent and allow someone to actually rent the property.&nbsp; That Ingrids building goes for $52/sq ft and the last store rented for $14K/month per Street Easy ( that info is at http://streeteasy.com/building/78_19-37-avenue-queens#tab_building_detail=3 )&nbsp; <br /><br />One other fun find..<br />So what&#039;s that building worth you ask?<br />Current year&#039;s total market value of the land: $1,100,000<br />Current year&#039;s total market value of improvements: $3,082,000 (it was $2,003,000 in 2012)<br />Current year&#039;s total market value: $4,182,000 (it was $3,103,000 in 2012)<br />Read more: http://www.city-data.com/ny-properties/assessments/Queens/3/37th-Avenue-22.html#ixzz4tkV2xb2d<br /><br /><br />

				During the recession, when Manhattan properties went vacant, and even newly built, luxury homes with stores under them could not be filled, many landlords used their spaces as exhibition spaces for artists, all at no to low cost (a share of any sales that take place).&nbsp; The places looked more attractive with something going on inside them, and eventually, the stores rented and the pop-ups went away.&nbsp; But there were many memorable exhibits, and there&#039;s no reason that can&#039;t happen here either.

				I took a walk down Steinway Street in Astoria the other day.&nbsp; From around Broadway to 28th Avenue I counted <span class="bbc_u">29</span> empty storefronts.&nbsp; While the landlords may be paying their taxes, there comes a point when those empty stores start to drag down other businesses.&nbsp; Maybe the answer is not the proposal mentioned above, but if landlords aren&#039;t realistic with their rent demands, and a once vibrant shopping strip starts to look like a ghost town, does the city have any obligation to act?

Many other areas of the US have been dealing with empty storefronts and ghost town downtowns for years. In Pittsfield, MA back in 2001, a storefront artists project was started and was very successful, however, it was a very different situation in Pittsfield vs. NYC, as landlords actually agreed to offer the spaces for free. I can&#039;t see that ever happening here. <br /><br />Here&#039;s an article about the Pittsfield project, which closed in 2011 because it was so successful (downtown was revitalized and therefore landlords could start charging for the storefronts again). https://www.mma.org/successful-artist-run-project-pittsfield-comes-end

				There has been a push from our local politicians that commercial rents should be regulated. An expiring l saw could only be increased a small amount. I don’t think the government should be into setting price controls although I know I am in the minority with this position. Of course the negative side is that we have a few landlords that own entire blocks of commercial stores and have a near monopoly on locations such as Midwood Management owns most of 74th Street.

				Taxing someone just because their property is vacant is a horrible idea.&nbsp; I agree that empty stores are an eyesore, especially if the owner is absent and doesn&#039;t take care of the property at all (like the Gothic property - the owner never shoveled and the place was an ice patch), but there are solutions to assure - or to punish - an owner to keep the place clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer in the market.&nbsp; You may be able to keep your store vacant for a year, maybe two, but eventually, you will need income and, with that, you will have to accept a lower rent.&nbsp; I agree that we&#039;re in a transition period for businesses, so maybe landlords know this too and are waiting it out.

				Waiting it out for what? Online shopping is taking over. They are waiting it out until they can magically get higher rent--or simply till they can attract a bank or a chain pharmacy? Soon we will literally have banks and pharmacies all in a row, both sides of the street, and nothing else.

				I believe that if the proposed trade tariffs with China go ahead, it&#039;ll drive even more shopping online.<br /><br />Because what I can glean the tariffs only apply to commercial quantities imported.<br /><br />And personal shopping direct from China would remain tariff free.<br /><br />So folks will be able to buy direct from China cheaply online. While goods in stores would be at least 25% more (the tariff).<br /><br />I am guessing there&#039;ll be even more empty storefronts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even dollar stores could become less competitive compared with online shopping.

				I think if it were just plain capitalism, the storefronts would be rented.&nbsp; Capitalism doesn&#039;t really exist in NYC to the extent that the state and local government regulate rent, transportation costs (e.g. train fare, bridge tolls, gas taxes, etc.), terms of employment, liquor licenses, price labels (see: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/about/PricingLaws.pdf), etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guess is that it is probably a confluence of factors, including unrealistic rental goals and government interference.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we lost two wonderful stores that served the needs of the community.&nbsp; Hopefully, capitalism will kick in at some point in the near future and maybe the neighborhood get vendors that will serve the community&#039;s needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;

I was suggesting that pure capitalism, which was raised by dssjh, does not really exist in New York City.&nbsp; To support my point, I in no way limited my examples to those that relate to store fronts.&nbsp; For instance, I pointed to transportation costs.&nbsp; What does the store fronts on 37th Avenue have to do with the metro train fares?&nbsp; Not much; but, with regards to my larger point, all of my examples point to areas in our lives where the government regulate the capitalistic forces - for good or bad does not matter to make my point.&nbsp; However, with regard to my larger point, I think it is hard for a small business to get started and survive the first five years because of the overbearing nature of the government regulatory apparatus in NYC, which are obstacles for a lot of small business owners.&nbsp; One mistake can literally put a place out of business, e.g., the Department of Consumer Affairs can assume that an employer violated the law with regards to all employees if they can show that the employer violated the law with regards to one employee and then use this to impose per employee penalties of up to $1,000 per employee and past employees. The employer can defend and win and end up giving all that money to a lawyer. <br /><br />Commercial landlords are not helping the situation either.&nbsp; They ask for incredible amounts of money and are willing to keep their properties vacant until someone pays up.&nbsp; The communities are the ones that ultimately pay the price.&nbsp; Ultimately, I hope the places rent for establishments that will serve the communities needs and will stick around for years to come.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a gastro-pub in the neighborhood.&nbsp; One can dream.

				It looks like we may be getting another empty storefront. The ladies clothing store located on the south side of 37th Avenue, between 79th and 80th Streets, The Ultimate Look, is closing. I wasn&#039;t aware of its longevity in the neighborhood. It&#039;s a pretty large space, so I&#039;m wondering what will come next.

				KDGHP--are you new to JH? Because it&#039;s been a long-standing lament re: the empty storefronts and the seeming impossibility of small businesses making a go of it here. The commercial rents are astronomical--I think someone posted that they are higher than in places like Park Slope. It&#039;s a larger problem, of course, with everyone getting everything delivered by Amazon, Fresh Direct, etc. and retail stores going under: Toys R Us, Lord and Taylor&#039;s flagship store, etc. <br /><br />The list you posted of businesses you&#039;d like to see come to 37th sounds great but totally unrealistic judging by what actually manages to open here. When the Bruson Building had to be rebuilt due to the big fire, there were community town hall meetings where residents tried to influence what kinds of businesses would wind up in the new building. I recall hearing a rumor there might be a gourmet food market, for example. <br /><br />In the end yes, we did get two new restaurants there, which is great--especially Romeo&#039;s which offers the area something different-- but I don&#039;t understand why the largest storefront is devoted to a home care business. Why does a business like that pay for a storefront location? It&#039;s a large space--I&#039;ve never walked by during business hours, but is it filled with employees and clients meeting about home care arrangements? It seems so odd to have that business in that space--have you ever seen a storefront home care business anywhere else in NYC?<br /><br />Then there is a bank and the same convenience store that used to operate there--one of many convenience stores along the avenue. Again, it&#039;s a larger issue that just 37th Ave in JH. Businesses close and then the storefront remains empty for years, I guess serving as a tax write-off to the landlord. Maybe the only way to improve the situation is to get rid of the tax incentives that may make it more profitable to keep the spaces empty than to rent them.

I suppose it also attracts abusers who will charge medicare and medicaid for taking care of their relatives and friends.&nbsp; If it were a normal agency, as you said, it would not be in a storefront.

				you are absolutely correct, Captain. my first NYC apartments -- from roughly &#039;82 to &#039;87 -- were all under $500 for two/three BR. all were in undesirable areas that people now love. only one exists as it did when i lived there (though clearly fixed up). we paid $275 for a two BR on Eagle St. in Greenpoint in 1985. checked street easy late last year, and the exact apartment was renting for $2900. that&#039;s not &quot;keeping up with inflation.&quot;

				50 square feet is probably bigger than many food vans.&nbsp; And they are everywhere.<br /><br />BTW JK Resident, you would continue to be free to shop wherever you like.&nbsp; <br /><br />So there is clarity, I am not suggesting forced shopping. <br /><br />Also, I am not speaking of renting, I am speaking of buying the retail condo/co-op just like the NYC real estate apartment market ranges from places you can purchase... from micro-apartments onwards. <br /><br />The solution here is to stop what is happening in Stephen Grey&#039;s video above.<br /><br />Please feel free to do research by watching the video. <br /><br />Eventually, the retail condo market will happen.&nbsp; It&#039;s a solution for the future.&nbsp; And I realize that anything new...or any changes... always appear to upset many folks.

Then there is the blight that shuttered stores bring, including vagrants, graffiti and trash.<br /><br />Some tenants blame the warehousing of storefronts by landlords waiting for development deals or zoning changes, or simply holding out for top rental dollars from large corporate retailers like drugstores, banks and restaurant chains. But even many national chains have shrunk their roster of stores.<br /><br />Some landlords say they simply cannot find retail tenants willing to lock in long-term leases at rents that enable them to meet building payments. Others say that retailers are not biting, even at bargain rents. Whatever the factors, the vacancies are changing the look of the city’s streetscape.<br /><br />Click link at top for article

				yes, modern developments like online retail are impacting the sector. but if you look at LoopNet once in a while, you&#039;ll see the same spaces vacant for 18 months, two years, no drop in the overly &quot;ambitious&quot; asking price. these landlords don&#039;t care if the spaces stay vacant. they get a break, and always will, even as tax breaks are taken away from homeowners.

With the passage of five bills on Tuesday, the City Council is hoping to gain a better understanding of the problem. Three of the bills require annual reporting on storefront vacancies, the business environment, and specific tracking of mom-and-pop shops.

				Eventually, once 50% of storefronts are empty, the rents for commercial storefronts will be forced to decrease.<br /><br />Supply and demand.<br /><br />So perhaps in the future we may have far more interesting stores. As the cost of rent for stores plummets, folks can take more risks.<br /><br />Could all be positive. But there&#039;ll be up to 5 years of empty storefronts to endure around us first...before the commercial store rent market collapses.

				i admire that optimism. and while i don&#039;t see commercial landlords agreeing to lower rents as long as they get tax breaks for keeping storefronts empty, i hope you&#039;re right.

				not off topic, but out of area....even McDonald&#039;s is getting squeezed out of the market.<br />A Brooklyn McDonald’s isn’t lovin’ a massive rent increase proposed by a new landlord.<br /><br />The golden arches outpost on Atlantic Avenue in Prospect Heights, which recently underwent extensive renovations and extended its lease through 2039, claims Vanderbilt Atlantic Holdings LLC — eager to get the eatery out so it can build “lucrative, high-density” housing — is turning the screws.<br /><br />The McD’s, just down the street from Barclays Center, says Vanderbilt is trying to up the rent 545%, from about $14,000 a month to nearly $90,000. The ubiquitous fast-food chain is suing Vanderbilt in Brooklyn federal court for “attempting to corrupt a contractually required fair-market rental-valuation process.”<br /><br />for the entire article, click link (no paywall)<br /><br /><br />https://nypost.com/2019/11/30/landlord-hits-brooklyn-mcdonalds-with-super-sized-rent-increase/

You might be able to run a pop up (month to month or no lease) bookstore in one of the empty storefronts. <br /><br />And run it like Housingworks Cafe/Bookstore in Soho. Which relies on volunteer (unpaid)&nbsp; folks working as staff to keep it viable.

				Jeff, I saw you earlier today on 34th and with the crowd that had gathered, I still maintain that a bookstore would do incredibly well in this neighborhood. Especially if it offered access to some services as well as great programming. I know I would be a patron for sure. I fully support your efforts and applaud you guys!
