				The former legal/notary storefront located at 78-09 37th Avenue (next door to the new health food shop) has a few DOB permits posted on its windows today.&nbsp; The permits indicate that alterations are being made for a new eating establishment, and according to the DOB website, a permit for new signage has been filed and granted.&nbsp; Name:&nbsp; Original American Chicken.&nbsp; This sounds like it could be a chain restaurant.&nbsp; Anyone have more info on it?&nbsp; The name alone doesn&#039;t sound too promising.

				According to permit information from the DOB website, the address of 78-07 37th Avenue (formerly USA Legal) is designated to a restaurant by the name of Original American Chicken, not Dunkin Donuts.&nbsp; The DOB also lists the owner of the business as Prabir Mitra.&nbsp; I Googled the name and came across a few articles identifying Mr. Mitra as the owner of various Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins franchises throughout NYC, including many in Queens.&nbsp; If this is indeed the same Prabir Mitra, it appears as he may be branching out by exploring the chicken market in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; By the way, I peeked inside the storefront the other day and noticed that the decor so far doesn&#039;t resemble anything close to a Dunkin.<br /><br />More info on Mr. Mitra here:<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2006/0426/features/011.html<br /><br />and here (scroll down to the heading <strong>Dunkin Donuts)</strong>:<br /><br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EED91031F932A15750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2

				(Begin midday food daydreaming...)<br /><br />This South Asian-American entrepreneur with experience running fast food franchises, and opening a new chicken business called &quot;Original American Chicken&quot; reminds me of my favorite fast food joint in the San Francisco Bay Area...<br /><br />Tandoori Chicken USA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tandoori-chicken-usa-el-sobrante).&nbsp; They make absolutely heavenly chicken sandwiches unlike anything available in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The food is tasty, and the concept is a hoot.&nbsp; They&#039;re located in and old 1950&#039;s &quot;Foster&#039;s Freeze&quot; on a very run-down commercial strip.&nbsp; The owner has the truly American dreams of franchising his business.<br /><br />Here&#039;s more...<br />http://nosheteria.com/2005/03/best-thing-to-happen-to-fosters-freeze.html<br />(FYI - the big purple eggplant painted on the window in the bottom picture is saying, &quot;Yes!&nbsp; We have Bengan Bartha!&quot;)<br /><br />It would be great if we could land something as kitchy and tasty as that!<br /><br />(End midday food daydreaming.)

				abee, when I looked, the walls had yet to be painted.&nbsp; However, I do recall seeing some paneling, but not pink.&nbsp; I would be surprised to see another Dunkin open in that spot afterall, as that would be contradictory to information posted at the DOB.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been reading lately that Dunkin has expansion plans in its attempts to compete with Starbucks.&nbsp; Your post now leaves me wondering.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather have a chicken place though, as we already have a Dunkin on 37th Ave.

				Hmm.&nbsp; In this space, we heard there was a chicken eatery being opened by someone with an Indian surname -- but now it appears to be a Dunkin Donuts and/or Baskin Robins location.&nbsp; Nearby in the former Baskin Robins space, I&#039;ve heard that there will be some sort of Indian restaurant.&nbsp; I wonder if there&#039;s been some sort of swap.<br /><br />Or should I be clinging to the hope that the pink walls are just a primer coat?&nbsp;

				Walked by the place today the doors were wide open, and now that it has been mentioned it does look like a Dunkin pink.<br /><br />However... I&#039;m confused... and certainly no fast food mogul or developer...<br /><br />But with the old Baskin Robins being closed why would an eating and drinking establishment not choose to set up shop in a space that already has that designation / facilities as opposed to redesigning a space that wasn&#039;t prepared? espescailly since both spaces seem to be about the same size. Is it a matter of location ?<br /><br />And is it really good business sense to open a Dunkin so close to another one ? Doesn&#039;t the franchise have a rule about that ?<br /><br />In the end, maybe we&#039;re in for a Dunkin Baskin Chickin adventure of some sort :)&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s no Dunkin&#039; I have seen the progress throughout the week and they have installed exhaust systems and grills and the kind of resturant materials that would make part of a Fried Chicken place. My predication from what I have seen ( the bright pink walls and the exhaust systems) is that it will be a Korean Fried Chicken place such as UFO Chicken .

				I picked up half a chicken yesterday, with two sides.<br /><br />Original American Chicken may have to rethink the ventilation system they&#039;ve installed...it was very smoky (from the grilling) inside the restaurant.&nbsp; Maybe it was just the first day and the ventilation system just wan&#039;t up and running yet.<br /><br />The chicken was moist, and overall good, but not great.&nbsp; The sauces (tomato and bbq) weren&#039;t very good at all.&nbsp; The sides weren&#039;t very good either.&nbsp; A great sauce and some good sides may have made all the difference...it didn&#039;t look like the restaurant cared about these things.&nbsp; Oh well, I&#039;ll go back and revisit them in a few weeks and see if things have improved.

				I tried this place on Monday evening.&nbsp; The food wasn&#039;t exciting, but the quality was good and I will probably return somewhat frequently because of its convenience.&nbsp; <br /><br />The one side I did have, a very lightly seasoned mix of steamed vegetables, was delicious and was not overcooked.&nbsp; But I agree with 80thStreet.... the overall appeal of the place could be greatly enhanced by a little more loving creativity with the sauces and sides.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t take too much effort to develop some top-notch, homemade sauces.&nbsp; Why not reflect Jackson Heights&#039; diversity and &quot;American&quot;-ness with a killer chimichurri sauce, a spicy Korean BBQ sauce, an Indian tamarind-type sauce, etc.?&nbsp; Or invent something truly &quot;Original&quot;.&nbsp; Right now, it&#039;s almost as if the owners are trying too hard to be generic.&nbsp; A bit more character (e.g. Chucker&#039;s suggestion of a place like Atomic Wings (http://www.atomicwings.com/site/menu.php)) would have been welcome.

				I tried the OAC on their grand opening day, Saturday.&nbsp; The chicken&#039;s flavor is reminiscent of your standard outdoor grilled chicken...the kind of taste you achieve during a summer BBQ outing.&nbsp; Well, at least that&#039;s what it reminded me of.&nbsp; I asked for BBQ sauce, but I think I may have gotten ketchup by mistake.&nbsp; It appears that I also tried the same veggie mix that Todd tried.&nbsp; This was a mix of carrots, cauliflower and broccoli.&nbsp; Overall, not very exciting, but not bad either.&nbsp; The smoke is an entirely different story, but I&#039;m hoping the ventilation system issue is something OAC will address quickly.<br /><br />We ordered:<br /><br />Whole Chicken served with pita bread and one side dish for $10.69

				I just had the worst meal since I&#039;ve been living in Jackson Heights. I decided to try this place out since it&#039;s right around the corner from where I live. I ordered the half grilled chicken and the mac &amp; cheese as a side. The chicken was dry and lacked any flavor. The mac and cheese tasted like watered down powdered cheese - really gross. Needless to say, I will never return.

				truthily?<br /><br />the rotisserie chicken is good. could use a little more spicing...or at least a little more salt and pepper ... but it&#039;s good chicken and a good value. the fried could use a lot more flavoring. <br /><br />the sides are very good. love the salads, and think the potatoes are terrific...lemon and mashed. just pick up the flavoring a smidge, and everything would be top notch.

				ate there once. wasn&#039;t into it. <br />seeing about 35 chickens on the grill and few customers makes me suspicious of how juicy it can be. <br /><br />Check out Chirpin Chicken or Chicken Lovers in Bayside.

				I like the flavor/juiciness of the various rotisserie places, but American Chicken&#039;s straightforward and less greasy grilled chicken is a welcome change from the others.&nbsp; I also tend to eat at American Chicken when I&#039;m looking for takeout that&#039;s kid-friendly.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know about the green sauce, and look forward to trying it.&nbsp; I think your sauce selection (ketchup, bbq, etc.) has been a real missed opportunity.&nbsp; (See my original commentary (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=515.msg6954#msg6954) when you first opened).&nbsp; Overall, I think you serve a well-prepared chicken, but I&#039;d love to see you get more creative with your sauces, sides, and preparations.&nbsp; A well-prepared grilled chicken sandwich, with high quality bread and other ingredients, would be especially welcome.

				So I went into the store today to order a half chicken with two sides.&nbsp; When I went to go pay, I only had $2 on me and TOAC does not accept AMEX.&nbsp; I apologized for not having cash and proceeded to leave the store (without my half chicken in tow), when the cashier gave me the food and said to pay him tomorrow.&nbsp; Of course, I went home, ate my meal, went to an ATM, and paid for my meal within an hour.&nbsp; Just thought I would share since this is not something that you see everyday.<br /><br />PS - I agree with the majority of posts that the chicken is just fine the way it is, but they should incorporate some variety in terms of the sides and the sauces they use.
