					Why does no one blame the police, who are clearly dragging their feet? (instead of fighting each other.)<br /><br />I&#039;m born and raised here, and while some homelessness has always existed in the neighborhood, it has never been this bad. EVER. Trust me I&#039;ve seen bad, growing up up the block from the Adult ambulatory home on 80th and 45th ave, which is technically Elmhurst. <br /><br />There is a reason I bought my place in the Jackson Heights historic/landmark distract. It was nicer and cleaner, comparatively. And it pretty much always has been. So what has changed? When did these homeless drunks start congregating in large groups in multiple spots? (and this isn&#039;t even including the 3-4 individual homeless people who have decided 37th ave is a good place to be.)<br />When people started demanding accountability from the cops for their actions.&nbsp; <br /><br />And for the love of god, can people stop buying the homeless on 37th ave food. They are not going to go away when they know they are going to get a free meal. In fact word will get around that there are people in jackson heights who will offer to buy the homeless food. If you are feeling charitable, donate to a soup kitchen. <br /><br />

					Hey, yes. I&#039;m shocked more homes and buildings don&#039;t have solar panel considering how much sun jackson heights gets and considering we are on elevated terrain. <br /><br />On the right side of 76th street right before northern blvd there is a complex (four buildings actually) that have solar panels on their roof. You can try reaching out to the management about who they use for solar panel since they already have&nbsp; a working relationship with them.

We got a huge pack of glue traps and have them in a few places in the kitchen and bathroom. It&#039;s disgusting how many there are. We&#039;re on the 5th floor of a co-op bldg and we also have once a month exterminating. Fortunately the water bugs stay in/near the bathroom (the cats hunt them which is nice!) but we&#039;ve got quite a few regular (German) cockroaches in the kitchen that come up through the heating vent. It&#039;s so gross.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the heads up about eucalyptus oil, but I am without fur babies. Plus I&#039;ve mainly stuck to tea tree oil and am now switching to Peppermint oil. Here is why. It turns out that on the show DEXTER, which contained a lot of movie blood, the special fx team came up with their own concoction for fake blood. Their recipe included peppermint oil because when they filmed outside they needed to keep insects away from the movie blood, which contains syrup. Worked like a charm. Should work for roaches as well. <br /><br />Also a glass salter shaker filled with 70% isopropyl alcohol and a few piece of clove with cotton stuffed in the opening is recommended by a guy in some south east asian country. If it works in a hot, muggy, jungle country, I&#039;ll take it.

Using essential oils like tea tree and peppermint and eucalyptus with vinegar and water. <br /><br />Fortunately/unfortunately our apartment building runs a minimum 10 degrees hotter than the actual weather, so in the summer time the apartments get very humid. The hallways are cooler. The roaches come up through pipes and radiators in the hallway, elevator shaft and incinerators and immediately want to go into the mugginess of the apartments. <br /><br />If they were handled in the basement, there would be far fewer making it to the 6th floor. I&#039;ve taken to putting glue traps in the incinerator and am going to mix boric acid with a filler to sprinkle around the floor. Unbelievable that I need to do this and that management sees anything beyond a once-a-month visit from the exterminator as too much of a hassle.

I&#039;m in the Colonial Court and the building is clean but the super doesn&#039;t care to add any glue traps or roach motels in the incinerator shoots and throughout the basement. I&#039;ve seen them in his office. He clearly isn&#039;t bothered by them. He probably thinks they&#039;re are just a minor nuisance. <br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted management directly, but the manager is dismissive claiming that waterbugs (big roaches) only come out when it rains. I get the feeling the super is downplaying how prevalent they are. They do the bare minimum of having an exterminator come once a month and think that should be enough. <br /><br />It&#039;s so frustrating. What the hell is the big deal with them putting glue traps in the incinerator and all over the basement. I&#039;ve taken to doing it myself for the incinerator shoot on my floor. My building doesn&#039;t allow pets, so there is no reason they can&#039;t leave poison out for the bugs.

					Yes, you can have one. Two people in my building have emotional support dogs and there is nothing the coop board can do about it so long as it is recommended by a doctor. <br /><br />If it is necessary, do it. And don&#039;t feel bad. Other people can have cats and screaming, stomping children, but you can&#039;t have a dog? please. enjoy

					Look to the people (parents) on your board. In my building we have a couple of parents on the board who feel that every amenity in the building must cater to the (their) children in the building and that anything done to that end is fine. <br /><br />This includes turning the backyard into a park, which it&#039;s not supposed to be. (garden does not equal park). Personally i am not trouble by this since i face the front, but the point is get involved with your board if you&#039;d like to have a say, and speak for those who feel as you do.&nbsp;

					It&#039;s a toss-up. Something about the way these blocks were designed make them perfect echo chambers. I&#039;m amazed, not bothered, by how clearly i hear foot traffic and conversation from my sixth-floor, front-facing apartment. I am closer to 37th ave though. <br /><br />Also don&#039;t assume a window facing the back is guaranteed serenity. Parents, especially on the board, have a tendency to try to turn backyards into personal playgrounds for their children. <br /><br />If you want great lighting, pick a higher apartment, eastern exposure, especially facing a building with only 5 floors.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I&#039;ve been on Spectrum for a few years now and have only ever had basic internet service. I repeat basic. I am not a gamer at all, occasionally stream a movie, and do some light coding.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe at one point I was paying $29.99, maybe 8 years ago. It then increased to $39.99. Then $49.99. At one point I asked why is the price increasing. They said something about improvements to their system and premium high-speed internet. I reminded them that I only have basic internet. They said that that was the premium service. ?! (call comparatively basic bandwidth premium and then charge for the designation?)<br /><br />This month&#039;s bill is now $59.99. I call to ask why the increase. They tell me that I have been on a $20 promotional introductory plan. I tell them I&#039;ve been on spectrum for years and if it was &quot;promotional&quot; wouldn&#039;t I now be paying $69.99.<br /><br />She spends 20 minutes &quot;talking to a manager&quot; and then tells me i have been a client since 2012, but that some glitch in the system allowed me to keep the $20 discount for this long. And then she tells me that i still have a $10 discount, but her system can only predict my billing statements through July. So basically I have $69.99/month to look forward to for basic internet service come August. <br /><br />Anybody else have an experience like this or can shed any light on this?

					I peeked in as well. I saw a sign on the floor that said Kick Boxing with an accompanying graphic of a lady in workout attire kicking. I&#039;m thinking it is going to be more workout oriented as opposed to kick-your-head-off oriented.
