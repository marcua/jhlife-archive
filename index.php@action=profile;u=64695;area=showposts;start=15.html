The rate has been increasing for 31 days.<br />-Seven countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Sweden) had a weekly test positivity of 3% or higher and four countries (France, Greece, Netherlands and Slovenia) had a weekly test positivity that had increased compared to last week.<br /><br />Your &quot;only city&quot;/&quot;nowhere/everywhere&quot; claims are quite Eurocentric... masking is incredibly common in many Asian cities.&nbsp; See these articles for reference:<br /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52015486" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52015486</a><br /><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/11/what-a-korean-teenage-fashion-trend-reveals-about-the-culture-of-mask-wearing-393204" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/11/what-a-korean-teenage-fashion-trend-reveals-about-the-culture-of-mask-wearing-393204</a><br />And a scholarly article citing the rate of mask-wearing in Korea as one reason for their low rates: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291980/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291980/</a><br /><br />As for it being a &quot;weird NYC cultural thing,&quot; we are learning new things about COVID transmission, infectivity, and treatments every day and personally, I plan to continue wearing a mask to protect both myself and my community until we understand the virus and have better prevention/treatment available.&nbsp; Wearing a mask is such a truly minor ask, I don&#039;t see what the rush to end the practice is if it may have even a minimal benefit.

					I have gotten 2 COVID tests in the past few weeks (no symptoms, just planning to start seeing my parents/in-laws again and wanted the reassurance before seeing them).&nbsp; I thought it would be useful to have a thread to share experiences at the various test sites in JH.<br /><br />1) Stat Care Urgent Care (80-10 Northern Blvd)<br />-Required appointment which I made online<br />-Required I fill out registration and all paperwork online ahead of time<br />-I had to pay a $50 urgent care copay (the test itself is free but the urgent care billed for the actual visit)<br />-I was in and out in ~20 min<br />-Was told the results would take 3-5 days.&nbsp; I got tested on a Friday and my result was available on Healow (patient portal) on Monday.&nbsp; It might have been even quicker but they entered my email wrong in the registration so I couldn&#039;t log into the portal over the weekend.<br /><br />2) Elmhurst Hospital (tent in front of ER entrance off Baxter Ave)<br />-No appointments<br />-Supposedly opened at 8am but they didn&#039;t open the tent until 8:50am.&nbsp; I got there at 8:05 and was 12th in line, there were another 20 people behind me by the time they opened the tent.<br />-Registration was the bottleneck, seemed like they were training a few new people this morning<br />-Staff was extremely nice and professional once I got inside, also very fastidious w protocols (changed gloves, purell-ed hands, and wiped chairs and pens w disinfecting wipes between every patient, tripled checked IDs to make sure patient labels were going on the right samples etc)<br />-Took my insurance info but it&#039;s not required and test is free, no cost for visit.<br />-Didn&#039;t leave testing site until 9:55a<br />-Was told results would be available online (MyChart) in 3-5 days, I can update with actual time when I get my results<br />-You can also get an antibody test if you request it but it&#039;s at a different location in the hospital, I didn&#039;t do it so don&#039;t have info about wait time/process

Children growing up without seeing the faces of those around them are sure to suffer the most regarding their ability to perceive nuanced&nbsp; information.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have so many thoughts about this conversation I don&#039;t even know where to begin.&nbsp; But I&#039;ll try.<br /><br />First, I am a physician and have been working in an inpatient hospital setting throughout this crisis.&nbsp; I, along with literally 100% of my colleagues across all disciplines from doctors to nurses to environmental services and food services staff, wear a mask for an entire 12 hour shift at a time.&nbsp; Sometimes I even wear 2 masks at a time!&nbsp; A surgical mask over an N95 so that the N95 can be reused multiple times.&nbsp; We can breathe in them, they do not interfere with &quot;normal respiration,&quot; and the worst I have suffered is an itchy face and some attractive mask-shaped acne.&nbsp; The idea that masks are somehow dangerous for the average person is a bogus pseudo-science argument, and if you truly have a contraindication to wearing a mask you better hope that everyone around you is wearing one because your contraindication puts you in a high-risk group for COVID complications.&nbsp; Just as immunocompromised people who cannot get vaccines need those around them to be vaccinated to protect them, if you have a medical condition which prevents mask use or believe your personal mask use endangers your health then you best be trying to convince everyone ELSE to wear one to protect you.&nbsp; If you do not have a true contraindication then a mask is at worst an annoying inconvenience.&nbsp; My patients are women giving birth and they wear masks to protect the team caring for them.&nbsp; If someone can push a baby out of their body wearing a mask, surely you can wear one to take a leisurely walk outdoors.<br /><br />Second, if you are willing to wear a mask to patronize a private business that requires it, then you are able to wear a mask.&nbsp; You are willing to ignore your personal belief that masks are useless or harmful in order to access a service that you want.&nbsp; Why are you not willing to make the same sacrifice to give your neighbors and community some piece of mind, even if you don&#039;t believe it&#039;s effective?&nbsp; People abide by &quot;no shirt no shoes no service&quot; even though going into a coffee shop in just your shorts isn&#039;t actually dangerous, it just grosses people out.<br /><br />Third, as a parent of small children I am more concerned about them losing 1+ years of school and real life socialization with peers/adults other than their parents than their ability to interpret the facial expressions of strangers on the street.&nbsp; You know what will get them back in school and into playdates with their friends faster?&nbsp; Universal mask wearing and deference to scientific experts in planning our next steps.&nbsp; I am not discounting the developmental damage that this crisis may have on them, but the ability to read facial expressions does not seem as critical to me as the ability to resume real-life in-person friendships, not to mention continuing to have living grandparents.<br /><br />Obviously I believe the data that universal mask wearing is effective in reducing asymptomatic spread.&nbsp; But even if you don&#039;t believe it, the harm to you in wearing a mask (even if you are right that they don&#039;t work) is a minor inconvenience.&nbsp; The harm to your community in not wearing a mask if you are wrong is devastating.

					Just refreshing this thread because I hope people haven&#039;t forgotten about La Esquisita/ERT2!<br /><br />We went for brunch today around 9:30 and it was pretty empty.&nbsp; A bunch of people stopped in for coffee and a pastry but no one else was really sitting for a full meal.&nbsp; <br /><br />The full ERT menu is back and just as good.&nbsp; Victor&#039;s rearranged the space since he first opened and it is definitely more conducive to sit-down dining than it was when he first opened.&nbsp; They also deliver!

					When I lived in Manhattan 5+ years ago I was a huge fan of the original/only location in East Harlem.<br /><br />Tried the new JH outpost of it tonight and was not disappointed!&nbsp; Totally an authentic taco joint, don&#039;t be fooled by the modern/minimalist decor.<br /><br />The menu has a great selection (tacos, tortas, cemitas, sopas, nachos) and they prepared everything fresh while I waited.&nbsp; We got mostly al pastor tacos since that&#039;s their specialty and they were definitely the best, but we also tried the bistec (very good), carnitas (not crispy enough for my taste), and chorizo (not dry enough for my taste).&nbsp; Lots of toppings available but kept it simple with onions/cilantro, limes, salsa verde, and pickled veggies (onions, peppers, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower).<br /><br />Just be warned there&#039;s no seating.&nbsp; There&#039;s an L-shaped counter to stand and eat at but not conducive to eating in with kids, we did take out.<br />

					ljr - 83rd St essentially turns into Hampton St about half a block south of Roosevelt (or rather it forks into Hampton and Baxter which runs along the east side of the hospital).&nbsp; La Esquisita is right there after 83rd turns into Hampton, it is very close to Roose.<br /><br />It&#039;s actually only 1 block from Terraza 7, Hampton runs parallel to Gleane (1 block south/west).<br /><br />If you are in the 80s the new location really isn&#039;t any farther than the old location, but if you are in the mid/low 70s it is more of a trek.

					We were huge ERT fans and really devastated to see it close.&nbsp; We went to check out the new location this morning.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy to report Victor was there and so were his empanadas.&nbsp; He said everything happened really quickly and he just found his new space 3 days ago.&nbsp; It seems like he took over an existing Colombian bakery; for now he doesn&#039;t have the ERT menu (we love the huevos divorciados!) it&#039;s just a steam table and bakery but he said over the next week he will be bringing his equipment over from the old place and he hopes to have the ERT menu up and running within a few weeks.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pretty small space.&nbsp; I hope he can manage to make it as welcoming and community-oriented as ERT was.&nbsp; We wish him the best and will be supporting his new place as much as we can!<br />
