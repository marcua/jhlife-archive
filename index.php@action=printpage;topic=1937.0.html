				Does anyone know the status of the &quot;Uruguya&quot; bakery on 37th Ave?&nbsp; It has been in a state of construction for many months now.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

				Its been under construction for at least two years possibly three.&nbsp; I was told back then that it would be the same owner as nearby La Nueva Bakery which made little sense.&nbsp; At this point, no one really cares whether it opens or not with La Nueva being so close. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey, this place is finally open.&nbsp; It has all the multi-colored triangular flying about that seem to always appear during a grand opening in this neighborhood.&nbsp; Someone please check it out and report back!<br /><br />37th Ave between 85th and 86th.

				Hi, went to the Uruguaya bakery about 2-3 weeks ago and its really nice, it has a nice decor and they carry all the Uruguayan baked goods as well as some Colombian treats. Most of the baked goods are Italian and French influenced and are really tasty, i liked the coffee too, you should check it out if you have the time. ::)

				It&#039;s the same owners and baked goods that they have had at both versions of La Nueva for years now.&nbsp; You can even see them walking the baked goods over to La Uruguaya from La Nueva between 86th &amp; 87th Sts.&nbsp; If you like La Nueva&#039;s stuff, you&#039;ll like La Uruguaya.

				Apparently, Gran Uruguaya Bakery had quite the spectacle of an opening celebration with musicians and dancers. See the video â€œ<strong>MANOS DEL CANDOMBE</strong> (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkKSrrVeGY8&amp;fmt=18).â€

				It looks like Gran Uruguaya Bakery is undergoing an expansion.&nbsp; Soon the bakery will also occupy the space adjacent to La Nueva.&nbsp; Business must be good.

				La Nueva/Uruguaya is about to reopen tomorrow, according to a sign on the door. It has indeed expanded to the place on the right, which, if I am not mistaken, used to be a botanica. The counter is still where it used to be in the original place, with the sitting area now expanded to the new space. I like the nice, big windows they put in but I feel the place is a lot less cute than it was before. It looks very much like La Nueva on 86th, with many tables and chairs, bare walls and nondescript tiles on the floor. I liked the ambiance before much more -- it used to be more coffee-place-like.

				Yes, La Uruguaya is more spacious and less crowded than La Nueva. &nbsp;Space has no personality, but looks like they may not be finished decorating. All Neon and Flourescent lighting. Not sure why they don&#039;t make it appeal to a slightly different customer than La Nueva. &nbsp;Same food, same overall look...just more space and cleaner floors. &nbsp;Suggested to owner maybe they could add WIFI, but I doubt they would do that. <br /><br />

				Walked by it yesterday and it looks like they doubled the square footage.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have a chance to buy anything.&nbsp; Does anyone have any favorite dishes here?&nbsp; I find their cheese and spinach empanadas to be delicious.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, the fruit stand on 37th b/w 81st and 80th also expanded to the adjacent store, so it looks like some businesses are doing well enough to take on more space (and rent).

				Sorry to say that a friend and I stopped in last week in the afternoon for some tea and a little sweet from the many they have on display.&nbsp; Friend had a Napoleon and I had a strawberry mousse-type thing.&nbsp; In both cases, the dessert was very stale, as if it had been sitting for days and gotten dried out by the refrigerator case.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard a similar story from others.<br /><br />I do love the empanadas though but I go to the source - La Nueva - for them.
