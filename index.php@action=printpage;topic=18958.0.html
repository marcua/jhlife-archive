				Sad to see that Yelpers are reporting this place as permanently closed.&nbsp; Anyone have confirmation on that? I’ve walked by a few times in the past couple weeks and yes, it hasn’t been opened but still looks like all the tables and gear are there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was hoping for a vacation situation. <br /><br />It’s a shame, because they brought something new and exciting to the neighborhood. Never had the burgers, but I heard they were excellent. Certainly looked great.&nbsp; The ice cream was very cool, my girls loved watching them make it.<br /><br />It’s also a shame because two stores away the Middle Eastern restaurant also closed. I wasn’t completely blown away by them, but one has to wonder if there are limitations on what types of food can succeed in our neighborhood.

				it is too bad that they couldn&#039;t have hung on a couple more months to capitalize on more ice cream friendly weather.
