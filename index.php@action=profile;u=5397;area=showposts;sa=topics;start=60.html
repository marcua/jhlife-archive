					&nbsp;There are now porta potties at Travers Parks which are filling in for the closing of the <br />restrooms in that part of Travers Park which is being renovated. Parks Dept folks say<br />they are working on this and understand the inconvenience. Still waiting for work to<br />happen on the basketball courts which have not been touched in recent renovations<br />to the little kids areas which have been reworked four times in my recollections!<br /><br />&nbsp;Throw a bone to the teens who use the basketball courts next time. Little kids grow<br />up to be bigger kids and athletics are a healthy, non-screen outlet for them but that<br />basketball court is horrible, slanted and moldy.

The Historic<br />tours, slide lecture and exhibition of memorabilia and the private garden tours are all next <br />weekend June 8th and 9th. Children&#039;s art posters on the theme of Jackson Heights gardens are<br />on display now throughout the neighborhood especially along 37th Avenue.

					&nbsp;Every year when reading about the car free days in Manhattan where the street closures allow pedestrians the <br />experience of using the entire street, would that ever happen in Jackson Heights? What streets would be best?<br />Would merchants be on board or not?&nbsp; And what kinds of activities can take advantage of this closure? I know<br />the 82nd street festival is great and it&#039;s a few blocks but what if we were to use a whole avenue for health<br />and exercise activities for all ages, special promotions with all the stores, information on jobs, community<br />events and schools, maybe an art fair or a giant flea market?<br /><br />&nbsp;Do you think there would be an interest locally in a car free day along one of our avenues in Jackson Heights?

					&nbsp;Are you enjoying the fabulous display of spring trees going on now? Want to make more of this experience in your own world&gt; The link below connects you to the New York Restoration Project for a free tree giveaway is open and trees are being reserved.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Check now to reserve yours for the this Sunday pickup at the JH Green Market on 79th street at Northern Blvd from 10-noon. These trees can be planted at your co-op, apt building, home, school or place of worship, plus a few other areas. Not street trees though as the city does that. Partnering here with the Jackson Heights Beautification Group or JHBG.<br /><strong><br />&nbsp;Did we mention FREE? see the list below</strong>.<br />&nbsp; <br />Here is the link:https://www.nyrp.org/green-spaces/events/tree-giveaway-with-the-jackson-heights-beautification-group<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">And here is a list of the trees that are currently available to you:[</span></strong>/u]<br /><br /><strong>SERVICEBERRY AMELANCHIER LAEVI</strong>S <br />Native Americans oftentimes used service-berries in the making of pemmican, a dried mixture of berries and fat.<br /><br /><strong>AMERICAN PLUM PRUNUS AMERICAN</strong>A <br />Growing 25 to 30 feet tall with a spread of 25 feet, Mexican Plum OR American Plum, is a North American native tree which forms an irregular canopy composed of yellow/green, shiny leaves with fuzzy undersides and thorny branches. In spring, the trees are smothered with fragrant, white blooms which are followed by purple/red, juicy fruits. These tart fruits can be used to make jams and jellies. The blooms help make Mexican Plum ideal for use as a specimen tree but it also fits in nicely in the naturalized landscape as an understory tree.<br /><br /><strong>SWEETBAY MAGNOLIA MAGNOLIA VIRGINIANA </strong><br />the first magnolia to be described by modern botanic nomenclature; the scent of the bark is reminiscent of sweetbay.<br /><br /><strong>FLOWERING DOGWOOD CORNUS FLORIDA </strong><br />The Flowering Dogwood is a small, ornamental tree reaching 20&#039;-30&#039; tall and 25&#039;-30&#039; wide, and is easy to maintain. This tree grows at a moderate rate, growing as tall as 15&#039;-20&#039; in 20 years, and reaches its mature height and width after 20-30 years. This tree requires full sun; partial sun or partial shade and well-drained soil. The fall color depends on site and seed source but most sun grown plants will be red to maroon. The white or yellow flowers turn to bright red fruits, which are often eaten by birds.<br /><strong><br />EASTERN RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA </strong><br />Juniper oil is distilled from the wood; twigs and leaves. The cones are used to flavor gin and as a kidney medicine. Native American tribes used juniper wood poles to mark out agreed tribal hunting territories. French traders named Baton Rouge; Louisiana (meaning &quot;red stick&quot;) from the reddish color of these poles. Junipers can live for more than 800 years.<br /><br /><strong>BLACKGUM NYSSA SYLVATICA</strong> <br />This species is named after a Greek water nymph, which leaves a clue as to which soil types it prefers.

					&nbsp;In the current race for President, the &quot;undecided&quot; Sherrod Brown makes the most sense to me with suggesting <br />that we start with Medicare for Over 50. Then build on it with the inclusion of private plans if people want them<br />and any other variations. In his opinion, this change is an easier sell and a much easier change initially while<br />being mindful of the goal of coverage for all eventually.<br />&nbsp; Any thoughts?
