Volunteer responsibilities primarily involve working at weekly distribution, but can also be fulfilled by participating in the low income task force, data entry, special events and vendor recruitment. Please visit the volunteering page for more information.<br /><br />Membership includes a weekly newsletter from the farm with recipes and information, and CSA events include cooking demonstrations and farm trips.<br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Click here to sign up!! <a href="http://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2016" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2016</a></span><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">when and where can I pick up my share?</span></span><br /><br />On Thursdays between the hours of 5:30 and 8:15 p.m. at St. Mark’s Church at 33-50 82nd Street. Enter through the 82nd Street gate, and come through the backyard. In good weather, we’ll be outside; in the rain, snow or cold, we’ll be indoors on the first floor.<br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">how much produce will I get each week?</span></span><br /><br />There are between 6 and 10 items in the share each week. During the summer and autumn months, the shares are much fuller than during the first few weeks in the spring. If you are a large family eating a primarily vegetarian diet, you might consider ordering more than one full share. See harvest schedule for more information.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">vegetable share </span></span><br /><br />$587.08 includes $548 paid to the farmer, + $11 administrative and operating expenses + $25 subsidized share fees + $3 Just Food Network Fee<br /><br />This is the standard 26-week membership share.This share contains 6 to 10 items each week, depending on the season and availability. Shares may include items such as: In spring: Arugula, Lettuce, Radishes, Strawberries, Sugar Snap Peas, Swiss Chard, Beets. In summer: Watermelon, Potatoes, Garlic, Red Tomatoes, Basil, Green Beans, Eggplant, Zucchini In fall: Fennel, Potatoes, Lettuce, Broccoli, Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Toscano Kale, Winter Squash, Celeriac. The amount is enough to feed a family of three to four for a week. Many Farm Spot members split one share between two households. Please note that members organize this on their own and Farm Spot does not coordinate half shares.<br />26 weeks / $587.08 26 weeks (May 26th and ending on November 17th)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">fruit share</span></span><br /><br />$102.90 includes $96 paid to the farmer + $6 administrative and operating expenses<br />Golden Earthworm Farm is teaming up with Briermere Farms to offer a non-organic, yet responsibly grown, minimally treated fruit share. The Fruit Share will run for 15 weeks from July through October. It will consist of tree fruit only – apples, peaches and pears.&nbsp; 3-4 lb bag of fruit per week.&nbsp; One portion per week.<br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><br />subsidized vegetable share</span></span><br />Farm Spot remains committed to making our CSA financially accessible to our neighbors, and we are once again able to offer 15 subsidized shares for the upcoming season. The subsidies are funded by your fellow Farm Spot members. This year we’ve made some changes to the qualifications to increase access for people needing more financial assistance, so please read the following carefully before submitting your registration.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">Subsidized shares are now available at two levels, depending on your income:</span></span><br /><br />Share A, at a cost of $401.44 is for people who fit into the guidelines adapted from the Self-Sufficiency Standard for the City of New York: One Adult: $27,919• One Adult, One child: $47,854• One Adult, Two Children: $62,420• Two Adults, Two Children: $68,175. A minimum of a $75 deposit is required upon registration, and you may pay the balance in full or by monthly installments during the six months of the growing season at $50 per month.<br /><br />Share B, at a cost of $239.72 is for people who fit into the guidelines based on the WIC program by the size of each household: One person: $21,775 • Two people: $29,471 • Three people: $37,167 • Four people: $44,863 (for families of five and up, add +7,696 per person). A minimum of a $50 deposit is required upon registration, and you may pay the balance in full or by monthly installments during the six months of the growing season at $50.00 per month.<br /><br />Income verification is on the honor system — we won’t ask for proof of your income. If you have substantial resources beyond earned income, please be mindful of those who don’t and purchase a full-priced share instead. We cannot offer discounts on any share other than the vegetable share.<br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Click here to sign up!! <a href="http://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2016" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://csa.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/summer2016</a></span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">For more information e-mail us at <a href="mailto:farmspot@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">farmspot@gmail.com</a></span><br />[/size]

Each member of the group pre-pays for a share of the farm’s bounty. This model is beneficial to everyone! It gives the farmers a guaranteed income, which they receive upfront, when they need it most; it gives each member very fresh, affordable, organic produce that was grown locally (in our case, the farm is 70 miles away), and also a chance to get to know our farm and our farmers).<br /><br />Maggie and Matt will talk about the history of the farm, which is in Jamesport, Long Island.

It gives the farmers a guaranteed income, which they receive upfront, when they need it most; it gives each member very fresh, affordable, organic produce that was grown locally (in our case, the farm is 70 miles away), and also a chance to get to know our farm and our farmers).<br /><br />Maggie and Matt will talk about the history of the farm, which is in Jamesport, Long Island. She will also discuss how a CSA works, the many different types of vegetables grown on the farm, the challenges of running a certified organic farm, who works on the farm, and much more! <br /><br /><span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color">There will be a raffle of a Golden Earthworm t-shirt and tote bag which will be announced at 6:45pm!</span><br /><br />Stop by with your questions and curiosity about CSA. Farm Spot is now taking new members for the 2016 season, which starts at the end of May.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">All are welcome!!</span><br /><br /><a href="mailto:farmspot@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">farmspot@gmail.com</a><br /></span>
