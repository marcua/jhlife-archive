				&nbsp;Let&#039;s say you came into a some extra cash, and want to open up something on 37th Ave. Not food related for obvious reasons. Instead of a pharmacy or a $.99 store, what do you think would be successful? The rents are probably between 5-7k.&nbsp; I could make it happen, and with the right concept from you, you could be a part of it.&nbsp; I would love to hear&nbsp; your ideas. I&#039;ve lived in the neighborhood for many years, and would like to invest back into it, and also make a living. Maybe even a co-op business? I&#039;m open for ideas, and open to helping others and improving the neighborhood at the same time.

				I don&#039;t think a yoga place would bring in 2500 a week. Fish store, that&#039;s a tough one. If it&#039;s not sold, it gets tossed. Plus between the place on 90th, Pacific, food bazar, and the supermarkets. Their is a reason there aren&#039;t many around. Also, the spaces are to small for a bar or restaurant. Trader Joe&#039;s requires much more space than anything on 37th ave.&nbsp; Fairway, same thing. A book store would be closed within 6 months. A toy store is interesting, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;d get rich from it. And I think it&#039;s kind of seasonal. Do kids even play with toys anymore?

				Two businesses I&#039;ve long thought would work here:<br />1) <strong>A fair-trade goods store</strong> that sells gifts, etc. from around the world--in a place where people come from around the world. I&#039;m thinking of something along the lines of Ten Thousand Villages (http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/ (http://www.tenthousandvillages.com/)).<br /><br />2) <strong>A scaled down co-op grocery</strong> that starts small but follows the model of the Park Slope Food Co-op--but starts out filling in missing neighborhood niches (low-cost organic bulk items, great beer, cheeses). Co-op offshoots tend to dream too big at first, trying to replicate the entire place, but I think that would be a mistake here, even as I think something that&#039;s thoughtfully done could thrive and eventually have the same reach as the Park Slope.<br />

				People spend $ on an experience now.&nbsp; Coffee, food, cocktails,&nbsp; gyms, wellness.&nbsp; I also think a gym would work reallly well, especually something niche like crossfit, grace jiu jitsu, kickboxing.&nbsp; You do not need a lpt of space for these types of gyms, nor a lot of overhead.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are unwilling to do food or drinks or welllnes, that leaves retail. I cannot imagine competing against amazon in anything retail.

				That&#039;s a good point about competing with amazon. I was looking for shoes today, Timberland in particular at Modell&#039;s on 31st Ave. They didn&#039;t have what I wanted so I thought I would be better off getting them online.

				If you&#039;re not offering food and/or booze, you can&#039;t rely on the people&#039;s money at 10K/mo. you need to either somehow get a more affordable space* than a typical JH rental, or be able to tap into a much more lucrative income stream, like Medicaid. <br /><br />If you want to get &quot;rich&quot; as you say, then buy a property and rent out space.<br /><br />* maybe start thinking about a mobile business, something set up permanently in a truck, like a gourmet coffee truck...and please not like the burnt garbage that starbucks sells. Does selling prepared and packaged coffees rise to the level of food business that you mentioned? Also, people on this forum say they want fresh-daily breads. Purchase mini-loaves from local home-based bakers. Park wherever you can and text your location daily to your customers. Almost sounds like an adventure, no?<br />

				I know you said no food places but what about a prepared foods take out only place. A long time ago I worked at a very small but successful place like that on the upper east side.&nbsp; The owner culled recipes from many cookbooks and we picked out what we wanted to cook daily after the specials were chosen.&nbsp; We had many prepared side dishes, i.e. something just as simple as roasted potatoes was a big hit.&nbsp; People don&#039;t have time to cook.<br />Meatloaf was our best seller. lol

				This question comes up every 2-3 months and always gets the same response. For those of us without kids (and disposable income that we spend outside of the neighborhood), the things we really want are food (and drink) related. And they&#039;re received with a mix of eye rolling and scorn. Alas. <br /><br />- Cheese, meats, and prepared foods store similar to Bklyn Larder or R&amp;D Foods<br />- Cocktail bar <br />- Boozy brunch spot<br />- Good coffee shop in the mid 80s (bonus points for a good bagel) <br /><br />While an upscale gym or a movie theatre or a Fairway would amazing, they&#039;re obviously not viable options for a single store front on 37th. But there are some chain stores that wouldn&#039;t be so bad to have:<br /><br />- Sephora<br />- Muji<br />- Dog daycare (probably requires extra space)<br />- Ice cream shop (this winter you&#039;d have business all year round)<br /><br />

				If you&#039;ve reviewed the other posts on JHL about what residents want here, which I am sure you have, the ones most repeated are:<br />(I know you said no food, but….)<br /><br />Yoga Studio / Gym<br />Cocktail Bar<br />Coffee bar<br />Quality prepared/ specialty foods (a more focused version of Lemon Tree/Farm)<br /><br />Please note, there is a small/charming , one room yoga studio in Woodside called Suryaside Yoga, you may want to check out. Yoga does not require a big space. Over the last few months, 2 people saw the demand for yoga here, &amp; have started offering limited classes, 1 in a church space, and another renting from a dance studio on Roosevelt on Sundays. Every time I&#039;ve been to the class on Roosevelt, it&#039;s always full.<br /><br />Out of concern, I urge you to not open anything that competes with online retailers, I have been in the apparel business for 20 yrs, and see daily, how it is affecting the industry.<br />&nbsp;<br />Best of luck to you! <br /><br /><br />

				Good ideas, some of them anyway. Toy stores seem to be a popular idea. But with teachers salary, I wouldn&#039;t count on them. Kind of like people think that opening a pizzeria across from the school is money in the bank. That doesn&#039;t prove well for Sacs&nbsp; or Marios

				A store where you have say ten different tables.<br /><br />And you lease out those tables to folks selling whatever they have to sell. Eclectic. But whatever the goods that are sold, they should be curated/vetted by you. <br /><br />That is: good quality or appealing merchandise/food/drinks/books/whatever.<br /><br />And you charge merchants $500 a week for their tables.&nbsp; <br /><br />Making your profit by taking a % of the sales of the goods. <br /><br />Kinda like a mini classy &quot;artisan&quot; flea market. Or mini &quot;artisan&quot; department store.<br /><br />Where you are in charge of quality control and management.<br /><br />Clearly, there will constant turnover of merchants so the store will remain interesting to visit for customers. Sorta like a never ending pop-up store.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hmmmmm.&nbsp; Good idea but I don&#039;t think the flea market people would be able to afford to pay $500 a month to rent the table. Or whatever it would be. And I don&#039;t think there is that much merchandise to sustain something like this. But something to think about

				My next idea is this... in this article.<br /><br />A vending machine store.<br /><br />http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/bizarre-vending-machines/<br /><br />Yes, I am an ideas person. And love to envisage things.<br /><br />These vending machine stores are often open 24/7.&nbsp; And you don&#039;t really have to be there all the time.<br /><br />You can survey the store remotely.<br /><br />Also you could approach big retailers (UNIGLO, TraderJoes etc) to see if they are interested in setting up a mini outlet via vending machine, in your store.<br /><br />Anyway you&#039;d work out the balance of what moves and what doesn&#039;t pretty quick.<br />

				I don&#039;t think what you are searching for exists. Everything is now online and can be obtained for less time and money by ordering online. I am starting to get EVERYTHING that way because it saves so much time. There still ARE small bookstores--new ones have opened in Manhattan recently, but I notice that they combine books and gifts in order to survive, and often seem to have more of the latter. Browsing a bookstore is a different experience from ordering books online, and there are still people who want to buy books in a bookstore--especially parents who want to take their kids to look at and purchase books. But those rents! <br /><br />What I long for is a good Pilates studio with well-trained instructors and equipment-based classes. I am certain there would be demand for this--but just as certain that it&#039;s not a big-money business, and it probably would not work on 37th Avenue. I go to a great studio in Forest Hills that is located on a side street. It seems to be doing well. They offer a variety of classes besides classic Pilates, including massage and bodywork workshops, belly dancing, etc. They rent space to a massage therapist, too, another way to make a business like this more viable. The classes at this Forest Hills studio are MUCH less expensive than those at similar studios in Manhattan, which also helps make it a big draw for people who work in Manhattan and could also attend Pilates classes there. The most popular classes are always fully booked with a waitlist. Could something like this work on a side street here? Maybe combining Pilates with yoga?<br /><br />Someone mentioned co-working. I now work at a co-working space in Manhattan, WeWork. They are taking over the city, opening new locations everywhere. It&#039;s a great concept--it becomes a community as well as a workspace. You get connected with everyone else who works there via an app, and they hold classes and workshops and free meals often open to everyone who is part of the WeWork community. And there are other similar co-working spaces popping up everywhere. Maybe that could work in JH--but not in one of the small storefronts, maybe in Bruson. <br /><br />I agree with the idea that what people really want here IS food/drink related, offering things we don&#039;t currently have on 37th. As for what else might work in one of those storefronts? Beats me. There are lots of empty storefronts all over NYC, not just here, of course, and empty malls all over America. Combine that with these stratospheric rents and the fact that landlords can get tax benefits (I think) from keeping their storefronts empty...and the future for small stores just does not look good.

				Madalyn: re: coffee beans in the &#039;hood, I totally agree as far as buying them from the supermarkets goes. But E77 sells high quality beans that are not stale --but are expensive, of course. And you can get Illy packaged beans at Lemon Farms and maybe elsewhere, and that&#039;s a very good brand. I doubt a dedicated coffee/tea store would be able to generate enough money in JH.

				The question is what would be a successful ie. money-making business... from a small-ish space with a $5k monthly rent...in this diverse neighborhood...where much of the foot traffic is not USA-born.<br /><br />And therein lies the interesting challenge.&nbsp; I say vending machines are simply an inexpensive way of supplying folks with what they need.<br /><br />Other things might work...but may be riskier with that high rent and limited space.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As many have pointed out, anything you can buy in a store you can now get online, usually cheaper and more conveniently.<br />So a successful new business would have to offer something you can&#039;t get online--a class, small-scale events, etc. I&#039;m certainly no small business expert (having worked for nonprofits most of my adult life), but it seems to me this model is possible even with the exorbitant rents. The Piano Verse on Northern Boulevard, for instance, offers 30-minute piano lessons for $25-$20. That&#039;s an accessible price point for many residents. Important to note that they cater to both kids and adults, broadening their customer base.<br />So... maybe another music studio? Maybe a small book store that offers specialized talks or classes (one poster mentioned a cookbook store in Greenpoint--they must have a great events calendar), or a pottery studio? <br /><br /><br />

				Since retail everywhere is pretty much going out the window...thanks to technology...<br /><br />One positive side effect may be that commercial retail rents will eventually go down.<br /><br />It may take five to ten years before that happens since landlords must accept the truth of the situation first.<br /><br />But in five to ten years...perhaps interesting stores might be able to open...and not immediately be choked by rent requirements.

				Lol, sorry you feel that way Lilybell. Didn&#039;t mean to crap out on anyone&#039;s idea. Just that most of them were ill suited to the spaces available on 37ave.

Good handymen can do some things great, some ok and some they should<br />be honest and admit they haven&#039;t done said thing before but will try is my experience. BBBY is generic in my opinon<br />and this would be a store that has a bit more zing. But affordable. And when I go to other neighborhoods that have<br />these, the sense of community is wonderful too which is not in anything mentioned by the Amazin one. We used to <br />have a very high end Home Depot near the Bulova Center but it was a bit ahead of its time and closed fairly quickly.<br />Now I think we could easily handle more than generic goods and the prices they command.

				To the person who suggested a daycare: It&#039;s a wonderful idea, but again the rents are prohibitive. I know a wonderful, experienced early childhood teacher who wanted to open a daycare for 1-3 year olds in Jackson Heights; she knew there was huge demand, and she knew how to run a business. The problem was rent: she absolutely could not find a minimally acceptable space at a price point that would allow her to break even, never mind turn a small profit.<br />This is why so many early childhood &quot;centers&quot; are run out of people&#039;s houses and apartments.&nbsp; <br />I also wonder about the assertion that UPK has cut into the preschool business. If anything, the guaranteed reimbursements from city government are a source of financial stability.

				How about a small Groceraunt for Jackson Heights? There would be 4 elements: <br />1. Well-curated selection of groceries (fresh and shelf-stable foods that are tasty, usable items that people who cook or assemble their own meals would buy) <br />2. A small selection of creative well-prepared buy-by-the-pound cooked food (chicken, salmon, grain salads, veggies: all made with 100% fresh ingredients by someone with a palate for both freshness and good health). Deliciousness and freshness would be key to making this work and having return customers. <br />3. A tiny section of thoughtfully prepared grab-and-go foods like sandwiches, salads, grain bowls, and a couple really good, homemade-from-real-ingredients desserts in containers that you just grab and pay for (made with fresh, attractive, healthy ingredients). These would be SO memorably good that people would return weekly for the Groceraunt&#039;s signature items. <br />4. Lastly, a very small sit-down-and-eat area with 10-12 tables (small menu selection—maybe 6 total menu items for each meal, and with wines by the glass, of course, and good coffee). <br />This place needs attractive lighting and comfortable décor because no one wants to linger (or eat) under florescent lights surrounded by plastic furniture. <br />One kitchen and one staff would be doing all 3 of the food options, so their time would be maximized. I would be there 3X a week if someone could pull this off. <br />

				It really does sound like starting a business that would fill the desires of a number of responders and a business that would be able to generate enough revenue to cover the rent are mutually exclusive. <br />I would like to ask all of those who post here regularly about &quot;non gentrification&quot; and &quot;maintaining the character of the neighborhood&quot; how they believe that the status quo will remain when commercial lease rates in the neighborhood remain in the range that can only be afforded by national chains? <br />How many small, local businesses own their own buildings? How many personal or familial relationships with lessors will outlast the current generations lifespan? <br />Do you really think that it &quot;preserves&quot; the neighborhood to have a Verizon mobile store instead of a cheese shop that&#039;s owned by someone who lives a block away and sources much of their stock in the tri state region?

				Please don&#039;t open any business that has to do with kids...I live here to NOT live in a place like Park Slope that caters to spoiled brats.<br /><br />A cafe would be awesome...seriously. Espresso is great, but we need more cafe options in the neighborhood. But that might come too close to a restaurant for your tastes. I&#039;d also love a yoga or fitness studio, as others suggested, or a bookstore. I do think a bookstore could actually make money here (lots of old people with money...plus young people too!) and would open one myself if I had the money to do it. <br /><br />Would love a cool vintage store, but I might end up being the only customer.&nbsp; :D Or a shop that sells luxury goods like candles, makeup, skincare stuff, etc that are really popular these days.

				Knowing absolutely nothing about obtaining a liquor license in the area...I&#039;m going to also say a (predominately local) craft beer and cheese store a la Astoria Bier &amp; Cheese and their multiple off shoot locations called Milk and Hops. <br /><br />Feature NYC&#039;s best local beers (Brooklyn: Greenpoint, Other Half, Grimm, Interboro Queens: LIC Beer project, Finback, Singlecut). Offer cans/bottles, pints and growler pours. Excellent quality beers will be a draw for locals and tourists alike. The growler option is especially good for folks with families who want to bring something home to share and enjoy. I also recommend you to brouwerij lane in greenpoint as a similar model (sans cheese). What is nice is they do not keep late night hours (M-Th closes at 10p F-SU closes at 11p) so less likelihood for patrons to disturb the peace.<br />

				I have always considered starting up a consulting agency to offer low cost help to struggling businesses in the area or for anyone who feels as though they could do more with their restaurant/bar/hospitality establishment. It would not just benift the business owner by helping them get their place of business making profit but it would help boost the community as well. Consequently, more business would come your way and Jackson Heights would benefit from all the people coming from all over to go to that new Bolivian spot with the crazy sandwiches, or the Ecuadorian place who has special ceviche nights where they marinate the fresh fish table side. I couldn&#039;t help but go on but it&#039;s just an idea I&#039;ve had for a while now.

				It&#039;s not really about what we think we want...it&#039;s more about what we consistently leave the neighborhood to get.&nbsp; Here are mine:<br /><br />1. dog care (could be combined with dog supplies,etc)<br />2. books: Independent bookstores are actually doing well...two women are opening one in Kew Gardens...so I&#039;d say that idea has already been taken<br />3. meat:&nbsp; if my timing is off and I can&#039;t get to the farmers market or they don&#039;t have what i need, I have to leave the neighborhood for meat.&nbsp; So, the above comment about Brooklyn Larder /butcher might be good though food.<br />4.yoga/pilates: needed but no money in it<br />5. ice cream cone: good home made ice cream cones are not to be found around here<br />6. hamburger and a beer made with good quality meat<br /><br />people spend money on food/kids/dogs.&nbsp; Everyone in my building with a dog that needs boarding, etc uses a place in LIC. But, i&#039;m not sure day care/boarding of pets is a good fit for 37th ave.<br /><br />When I lived in Minnesota, one day a survey appeared in the mail asking us what we needed in our neighborhood in this old empty row of storefronts.&nbsp; The couple that sent out that survey ended up opening an ice cream shop in an unlikely spot. 15 years later it is still there and has been expanded multiple times and in multiple ways.<br /><br />Maybe you need to do some leg work down on 37th and the surrounding neighborhoods.&nbsp; Get to the people not on this board.

				Whoever said there is no good answer to this conundrum is right. Retail stores in general are in big trouble because everyone is buying everything online and if not, big chain stores have their markets wrapped up. Most of the ideas here are either 1, food-related which is what everyone wants but the OP does not want, or 2, ideas that would never in a million years yield the kind of profit needed to pay the rent. Bulk laundry detergent for people who can&#039;t afford to buy a bottle of it? There is Costco and a lot of other places to get something like that already, plus how could sales be high enough in a small storefront devoted to something like that? We have a zillion 99 cent stores already--don&#039;t they stock a huge array of household items like that? (I just got some really nice wineglasses at one of those places: 6 glasses for 10 dollars!) There just is no good answer. Upscale boutiques have tried and failed, as has at least one yoga studio. I order online and get almost everything delivered now--you can get exactly what you want and it&#039;s so much easier. I don&#039;t know what will happen to all these empty storefronts all over the city, not just here.

				I agree that a more upscale grocer that sold good cheese, bread and nice dry goods would be great. I also think a baby/ little kid play space that sold coffee and pastries would clean up.<br /><br />But also I think you should follow your interest. A food emporium run by someone who doesn&#039;t care about food probably wouldn&#039;t be very good....

				I think this is great idea.&nbsp; There are lots of variants on this model, from pure &quot;eBay stores&quot; I&#039;ve seen out in the suburbs that have no particular specialization, to thrift shops and collectibles shops that combine a brick-and-mortar storefront with an eBay presence.<br /><br />Here are some local examples of the latter:<br />Royal Collectibles in Forest Hills (http://www.royalcollectiblesonline.com/)<br />Gotham Thrift Shop in Ridgewood (https://www.yelp.com/biz/gotham-thrift-shop-ridgewood-2)<br /><br />As always, the challenge in Jackson Heights would be earning enough revenue to pay rent, especially for a business like this that needs a lot of space.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the stretch of Roosevelt between 61st Street and 74th Street probably has somewhat lower commercial rents and may be an easier place to start a business like this.

				What I meant above is that Wholefoods seem to have worked out a system whereby you can purchase unbranded things by the pound and it&nbsp; seems hygienic.<br /><br />That system could be copied elsewhere. <br /><br />

				There is Whole Foods, there is Trader Joe&#039;s, there is Fresh Direct--huge companies that can operate with many efficiencies due to size. I think it&#039;s very unrealistic to think someone can open a Mom and Pop type store in JH with its notoriously outrageous retail rents and somehow compete with huge chain stores for the same business selling foods in bulk. There are already numerous options for that. We have a few small food stores that cater to a specific demographic, but even those seem to struggle. It&#039;s very very very hard to make a go of a small retail store in NYC--is my impression anyway. And only getting harder and harder.

				abcdefghik...I don&#039;t know if you saw the link to the explanation of why the landlords are doing what they are doing. They can borrow against the inflated value of their property--that is based on the extremely high rents--and then they invest the proceeds, make money off it, and ALSO get a tax deduction from the unrented property. With that going on, I don&#039;t see why rents would go down--they are making more money by leaving the space unrented. And this is going on all over the city and is the reason you see so many empty storefront everywhere, notably in the Village and even on the Upper East Side. Many, many empty storefronts.

				Yes I am well aware of the scam that&#039;s going on now re: store rents.<br /><br />But like all scams that have no real basis... It will eventually collapse. <br /><br />Either thro legislation or the tipping point of sheer numbers of vacant store fronts.<br /><br />Eventually the city will notice! And take action with some new laws.<br /><br />It may take 5 to 7 years. Maybe more. Perhaps less.<br /><br />But it will happen. All bubbles burst. Including store rents. A person never knows when the bubble will burst, that&#039;s all.<br /><br />I look forward to the creativity of what folks will do re: the retail world in the future. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16073.msg80349.html#msg80349">Quote from: ljr on August 02, 2017, 06:00:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">abcdefghik...I don&#039;t know if you saw the link to the explanation of why the landlords are doing what they are doing.

				Time will tell. <br /><br />But the entire retail landscape is changing.<br /><br />Folks aren&#039;t buying in stores. They&#039;re purchasing online.<br /><br />So stores themselves will be worth less to landlords eventually. <br /><br />There will be less store business everywhere. Chains or not. Chains are also struggling nowadays.<br /><br />The only stores that can&#039;t be replicated online are venues where folks gather. Or maybe food.<br /><br />So I am interested to see what forward thinking entrepreneurs come up with.<br /><br />The beauty in life is change. <br /><br /><br />

				I think one of those color me mine type pottery stores would do really well here! It&#039;s usually pay by the hour where kids and adults buy a piece of unfinished pottery (a mug, vase...etc) and paint it. It gets cooked in a kiln and picked up a few days later. Kids love doing it on a normal day but it&#039;s also a great spot for birthday parties and I know some places that allow a byob in the evenings. The profit margin is pretty good and with al the families moving to jackson heights, I think it would be very successful.

				People have clamored for a full-service gym for years here. Small, creative stores, such as a boutique clothing store, have not been able to survive here. Few retail business seem to work out because of ridiculously high retail rents. What seems to work in Brooklyn does not work here--for the above reason and no other reason that anyone has been able to prove. Interestingly, I am in the UK at the moment and noticed a lot of empty storefronts--and when I inquired, I was told the same story: the rents are insanely high and only chain stores can afford them. Period. So to those who are coming up with quirky, interesting ideas for a retail business here in JH: dream on.

There&#039;s no need for people to get up hopes which would surely be dashed because the banks have structured real estate financing essentially as a scam on neighborhoods. This doesn&#039;t actually come down to the landlords themselves - the &#039;secret&#039; is that it&#039;s 100% about the banks. (Although I still think that in certain parts of the neighborhood, people from certain areas get preferential rents ... which is good because it keeps the renowned ethnic character of Jackson Heights. But we&#039;re not really talking about 73rd Street in this tread.)<br /><br />As abcd says, it&#039;s going to take at least five more years before we see that bubble pop or anything change, especially because the current state and federal governments aren&#039;t about to do anything about unhealthy bank policies. Let&#039;s make the best of what we have and try to vote for leaders who are willing to take a big hatpin to the banks.
