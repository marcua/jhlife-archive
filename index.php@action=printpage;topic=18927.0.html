				Hi hi,<br /><br />So we are currently actively looking to purchase a 2 bedroom/jr 4 around Jackson Heights. We noticed a lot of units going for sale in the 92nd street area/35th ave and are quite curious as they are the few affordable ones left.<br /><br />How is the area there? Is it safe? We work a bit on the late end and I would love not to have to worry about my walk home. Also, possibly thinking of starting up a family in 2-3 years.<br /><br />Long time queens resident so a little grit doesn’t scare me, but would love to get some opinions from locals! Thanks....

				there are fewer amenities in the low 90s than in the mid 70s to mid 80s, particularly in the southern part of the neighborhood. there *seems* to be a bit more negative activity up that way, but i don&#039;t spend a lot of time up there, so that&#039;s only second hand vibe. i wouldn&#039;t automatically shy away, should you find a place you like.

				It&#039;s outside the historic district (likely plays a part in the lower prices) and I would say, speaking candidly, there is a huge difference between the 90s and and the low 80s/70s in vibe, types of buildings, variety of stores and reataurants, etc. The cutoff IMO is like 88th street. <br /><br />Definitely less amenities, I think the school zoning is different, and some crime seems to happen up that way (reference: subway shooting/guy who just got shot on 86th Street). <br /><br />BUT, if you&#039;re willing to weather that and stick it out, you can get a good deal as the area will naturally start to evolve over time. I heard from the JHBG that the city is looking into expanding the historic district potentially, so that&#039;s positive! <br /><br />These are just my candid observations and maybe someone who lives in the 90s can offer a different perspective.

				Hello, <br />2006-2013 I lived on Northern/88th. I never had an issue, that being said , I wasn&#039;t walking home alone at 1 am<br /><br />In regards to the criminal gang activities/ stabbings/ homicides , in the last 7 yrs or so, it is almost always high 80s/lows 90s on or near Roosevelt/37th ave.&nbsp; You can find that find that info yourself, but I followed it pretty closely.<br /><br />If you are coming home very late, alone, you need to be careful no matter where you live in this city, right?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hum... thanks for all the insight! Will need to do a night tour there at some point to test out my commute back. <br /><br />Any insight to the Northridge Cooperative btw? I’m reading a mixed bag of reviews, but a lot of them are old.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

				I have no knowledge of Northridge.&nbsp; However, a few years ago, I went to an open house at the nearby Southridge on 90th Street and I was very impressed with the high quality maintenance of the building, the grounds, the area and of course the price and low maintenance.&nbsp; They do have a flip tax of $50 a share paid by the seller which keeps the maintenance very low.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t see anything negative about the area.&nbsp; On Northern Blvd you have a bus that takes you to Queensboro Plaza subway station.&nbsp; <br /><br />In Jackson Heights its all about location, location, location and being very close to the 74 Street subway station.&nbsp; This area is quickly approaching $600 a square foot.&nbsp; The average cost per square foot on 90th Street and above is $360 a square foot.&nbsp; A 915 SF one bedroom was just listed at the Berkeley 78 Street for $578,500 and a studio at the Manchester at 7711 35th Ave for over $400,000.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				well, i have over 1,000 shares in our co-op and the smallest apartments -- the few studios in the building -- hold around 500-600. so that would add up a lot more quickly.

				Shelby, I not absolutely certain, but I was told that the flip tax at the Southbridge is 25% which is similar to Roosevelt Terrace which also has a very low maintenance which includes electricity.&nbsp; The only other building in Jackson Heights that has a large flip tax that I&#039;m aware of is the Carlton House at 34-41 85th Street which is 10%.&nbsp; Is there a Jackson Heights Realtor that can conform the 25% flip tax at the Southridge Cooperative?&nbsp; Also, does Northridge Cooperative also have a flip tax?&nbsp; I know someone at Roosevelt Terrace who purchased a 2 Br apartment for $115,000 15 years ago.&nbsp; If she was to sell at the current market price, the flip tax would be about $95,000.&nbsp;

				I only want to offer my knowledge of the Southridge cooperative where we&#039;ve closed several deals. Flip tax is actually not percentage based there, but rather a fixed number per share. You need to doublecheck Northridge, but Southridge is $50 per share. An average 2 bed there is just over 200 shares, so flip tax which the seller must pay is just over 10k. Again check in Northridge, but Southridge also includes electricity in maintenance and there is an additional surcharge for number of air conditioners you have. I wouldn&#039;t get tangled in price per square foot, as those are strictly estimations when it comes to coops. If you decide you like an area and price/maintenance is right for your budget it&#039;s well worth a consideration. <br /><br />One slight difference with Southridge and Northridge coops. They have a &quot;right of first refusal&quot; rule. Meaning, when you go to sell, you must have the board sign the right of first refusal form before you can go to market. I learned it first time the hard way :) <br /><br />Other piece of information I can offer: One of our seller clients lived there since 1958 when building first came up and her buyer is still happily living there after renovating it fully. Other seller client lived there happily as well but had to move due to job change. Their buyers, also a family, are also happily living there. <br /><br />That&#039;s all I have on this. Hope this helps.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hello, I lived in the Northridge, it was a good starter apartment for a young couple. And ofcourse there is a very lively restaurant scene on Northern, and it has grown. <br />I do know they had become strict about wall to wall carpeting as we were selling, I think because of too many complaints from noise . It was nice to have the hardwood floors when we were there.Rules are strict on renting, as many Coops are in JH.<br />

				Were a young couple in our 30s and have lived in Southridge for just over a year now - building is located on 92nd and 34th. We wanted to stick to a strict budget, as this was our first home and we don’t plan to live there for more than a few years, so Southridge was a good choice for us for now. The maintenance is very low and includes everything. It’s an extra $30 a month per AC. For us it’s perfect as our mortgage and maintenance payments are so low that we’re able to save a lot of money and have the flexibility to travel, etc.&nbsp; The building is extremely well maintained and clean. The maintenance guys are all lovely and friendly. We don’t know our neighbors, but it definitely seems like a co-op where people have lived and raised families for a long time. I didn’t find the board approval process too unreasonable, although they do want to see a year of your mortgage and maintenance in cash in the bank after the DP and closing costs. They also require a 25% down payment, but I think that varies from section to section. <br /><br />In terms of the area in the 90s, it’s definitely not as charming as the historic district. While I would be cautious while walking home from the subway past a certain time, I don’t feel it’s unsafe. I think things get a much more sketchy past Junction Blvd, but we don’t venture over there and have no reason to. there’s an excellent Key Food very close by on Northern in the high 80s, and we’re also close to Addictive Wine Bar, which is a great spot. Overall, Southridge is a great co-op and the neighborhood is fine. We would have preferred the historic district, but prices for 1BRs are double or more. I don’t know about the schools in our area but we plan to move elsewhere once we start a family. <br /><br />I found it so difficult to get meaningful&nbsp; advice regarding specific co-ops and neighborhoods when we were looking, so I hope this is helpful.

				Argentarmen &amp; Kmriley41:&nbsp; &nbsp;I always thought the Southridge had a flip tax of 25% which is not true.&nbsp; &nbsp;So my understanding is that the transfer fee when someone sells at the Southridge is $50 a share even if there isn&#039;t a profit and even if there&#039;s a loss and history tells us this can happen since it has.&nbsp;
