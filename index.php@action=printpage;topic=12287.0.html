				Courtesy of MPC properties, we have the highest listed apartment that I&#039;ve ever seen. Appears to be a two apartments above/below each other that were combined.<br /><br />Ask: $949k<br />Monthly Maintenance: $1,600<br />Building: Hampton Court 35-45 78th Street<br />Features: Four bedrooms, two bathrooms, duplex, upgraded<br />Square Feet: Unknown<br />On-site parking: No<br /><br />http://realestate.nytimes.com/sales/detail/2007-500A69A07605A/35-45-78th-Street-QUEENS-NY-11372<br /><br />I must say, the pictures show a truly beautiful apartment. The laundry room / walk-in closet on the top floor is a knockout. I like the location of the building as well, close to the express subway stop but just far enough from the hectic-ness associated with Roosevelt Ave and 74th street.<br /><br />The lack of a square foot number worries me. To justify this price, I would expect at least 2k square feet, which would still price this apartment higher on a per square foot basis than nearly any apartment sold in the neighborhood. If the apartment is more around 1600 square feet, we are talking about close to $600 / square foot. An unheard of price in Jackson Heights. But, this apartment is unique. At $450 / square foot, I would seriously be considering it.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br />

				It looks like a 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment in the same coop complex (Hampton Court) was just listed for $417,500 and in contract for unknown amount.&nbsp; That 2/1 is listed as 975 sq feet.&nbsp; So I would imagine 2000 square feet for two 2/1 apartments combined is a pretty good guess. http://jacksonheightsgardens.com/listings/35-55-78th-street-52/<br /><br />One question I would have is what floor is the apartment on.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t this coop a walk-up (no elevator)?&nbsp; The listing mentions no neighbors above, so I am guessing the apartment would be on the 4th and 5th floors.&nbsp; That might deter some buyers who don&#039;t want to have to walk up so many stairs.<br /><br />I do think people looking for very large apartments are willing to pay a premium for them.&nbsp; And 2,000 square feet (if that&#039;s what it is) is very hard to find, so I think it&#039;s priced correctly, if a little on the high side.

				I&#039;m always a bit surprised at the bathrooms.&nbsp; You&#039;d think for a million dollars you&#039;d at least get a sink with a cabinet underneath instead of a tiny stand alone sink.&nbsp; But I grew up in a rural area so I tend to look for more storage space.

				Hampton Court apartments can be comfortable in size. But I do wonder about the 2 rooms that were used for the staircase. It seems to take up space and limit the useage of the those rooms. Did anyone else notice how the photos really push at the room sizes and the minimal furniture?

It&#039;s not the end of the world but it will hamper the sale of this unique unit at this price point. Especially when you consider most apartments of this size and price would be considered mainly by families with kids in tow -- you can only imagine that multiple daily treks up and down the stairs would get old really quick. <br /><br />Have an elderly parent that you would like to come visit you? Scratch this apartment off the list. A dog that you need to walk several times a day? Better to consider other options. <br /><br />Regarding the maintenance charges, I would&#039;ve thought that these buildings would have paid off any underlying loans by this point and built up a good reserve fund so the maintenance seems higher to me than it could and should be.

				It was overpriced at $1mil+ but at this reduced price, it will move. You can&#039;t find a 2BR in Brooklyn at this price much less a 4br!<br /><br />&nbsp;I disagree with some posters who didn&#039;t see the value in the kitchen and bath remodel. It&#039;s been overhauled but looks like it was always there. That&#039;s what we look for.&nbsp; We, the Brooklyn transplants who are used to spending 800k fir a 2BR and for whom this will seem a bargain.<br /><br />We don&#039;t all want farmhouse cabinetry and granite countertops. Do that if you love it and plan to live in it a while but it&#039;s not a resale plus.<br /><br />I love the jade bathtub and sink in that second bathroom! Keep original detail when you can, resellers.
