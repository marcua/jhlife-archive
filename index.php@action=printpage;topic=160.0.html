				can someone please suggest a professional tailor in the area? I&#039;m looking for someone with an eye for detail, not a cleaner with sewing machine.<br />I had a bad experience at JH tailors on 74th in Little India. On a pant hem, the guy wasn&#039;t even going to measure me until I demanded.

				From my experience, the best tailor on 37th avenue seems to be the establishment on the corner of 80th street.&nbsp; It&#039;s right across from Italian Farms. <br />I used to go to this other place in between 76th and 77th street on 37th avenue but I had an awful experience last time I went.&nbsp; They charged 50 dollars for shoddy workmanship and merely cut the fabric straight across with NO OTHER alterations.&nbsp; Something a mere child could do...and it was a $50 bill for 2 minutes of a poor performance.&nbsp; I was passive and should have shown a backbone to not pay the bill...but I didn&#039;t want to risk losing the expensive article of clothing, although it was damaged. I was highly agitated and refuse to EVER go back there.&nbsp;

				We recently purchased some fabric for curtains for our bedroom but we need someone to do the sewing. <br /><br />Does anyone have recommendations for an individual(s) that could help us sew the fabric into curtains (nothing fancy needed - just cut the fabric, make hems, etc. so we can hang them)?

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If one does not mind a trip to Astoria I know a wonderful seamstress her establishment is simply called Tailor Shop 30-94 36th Street&nbsp; (718) 956-4064.&nbsp; She altered two men&#039;s suits and a formal dress for me and did an amazing job.&nbsp; She is courteous, accommodating and reasonable.&nbsp; You can take the &quot;N&quot; train to 30th Ave. stop and walk east on 30th Ave. and make a right on 36th Street.&nbsp; Afterwards walk over to Rizzo&#039;s Pizza (30-10 Steinway Street) for the BEST square, thin crust pizza around or Zenon Taverna (34-10 31st Ave.) for wonderfully tasty Cypriot food.....try the hot and cold sampler! ;)

				As someone new to the neighborhood, I was hopeful that I could find a good tailor nearby, especially since there are so many stores that sell fabric for men&#039;s shirting and suits. I inquired at a couple these shops and they recommended I find a place in Manhattan. <br /><br />I&#039;m not giving up the search.

				Hello Neighbors,<br /><br />I know this question has been asked before, but the posts I found were a few years old. <br />I need the sleeves of a sports coat let out. Not complicated, but needs to be done right. If you have recent good experience with a neighborhood tailor, please post or let me know.<br /><br />Thank you, David

				I go to a place in Sunnyside, Tommy&#039;s Dry Cleaning on Skillman and 46th. It&#039;s a bit of a hike, but I find the quality of his work is worth the trip, everything is done in house, and Tommy is always there, so you&#039;re getting an accurate estimate and time frame on the spot instead of leaving your garment and waiting for a call.
