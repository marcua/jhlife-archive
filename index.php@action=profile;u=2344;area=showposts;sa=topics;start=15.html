					Neighbors, help me out. We&nbsp; had a small kitchen fire (fully contained within the stove so no major damage) on Sunday morning. The landlord has not yet replaced the stove. Every time I speak with him, he is unable to give me a clear, definitive answer as to when the stove will be replaced. Today is the fifth day that we have not had a stove. (Both the oven and stove top are inoperable as determined by the fire dept and National Grid-turned off the gas.)<br /><br />We are undertenants in a co-op and have never had a problem with the management company before. I don&#039;t know if the standard apartment regulations apply to us since technically we&#039;re subletters (we&#039;ve have had one-year leases each year for the past 4 years.)<br /><br />My questions - how long is reasonable for us not to have a stove? Is there any regulation about this? (We&#039;ve been eating lots of sandwiches, microwave meals, and eating out - and we have food that&#039;s going bad in the fridge because we can&#039;t cook it properly.) If we don&#039;t get the stove today (we&#039;re supposed to, but we were also supposed to get it on Tuesday and Wednesday) what should the next steps be? I already took two days off of work to stay home for the delivery on Tuesday and Wednesday, my partner is staying home today. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to take any legal action and would like to avoid filing a complaint, but this is getting excessive. [5 days with no stove, 3 days of missed work, and extra expenses for food (food spoilage because we can&#039;t cook and eating out)]<br /><br />Thank you!!<br /><br />

					I had an awful experience at the BP on Broadway &amp; 63rd (near Tires by Papi) today. I paid cash for gas, didn&#039;t ask for a receipt, the guy who pumped it didn&#039;t actually fill the tank, I went back and showed them that my tank wasn&#039;t filled up (was able to put over a half of a tank in - should have only been able to put in 2-3 more gallons if they really did just put $20 of gas in, I was able to put in nearly 8 gallons more!), and the owner accused me of lying and trying to steal gas. He called the cops, who couldn&#039;t do anything. He would not accept that his worker either made a mistake and didn&#039;t actually pump the gas or that the pump may have malfunctioned. The owner was rude and belligerent and chose to waste an hour and get cops involved rather than believe (based on the fact that my tank only holds 11 gallons! 5.5 [the initial $20] and 8 gallons [what I pumped the second time to show that the tank wasn&#039;t full] plus the 1/3 of a tank that I came in with wouldn&#039;t all fit!) that I didn&#039;t steal $20 worth of gas. This is absolutely ridiculous, and I&#039;ve filed a report with the BBB and DCA and have contacted BP.<br /><br />Has anyone else had a similar experience there? Rudeness or gruffness I can deal with - but this was completely out of line. Does this guy own any other businesses in the neighborhood?

					I live in a brick building and want to put in some kind of window boxes. I&#039;ve seen it done before, and a few people in my building seem to have them. There&#039;s nothing that prohibits flower/window boxes. Obviously I can&#039;t drill anything into the brick and my window casings are metal, not wood, so I can&#039;t drill anything in. Any suggestions? All I keep coming up with through searching online is window boxes that you screw into your suburban house. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Sorry for the redundancy here, I know that this topic has been brought up many times before.&nbsp; Whenever I mention to a friend that I live in JH their first reaction is &quot;Awesome! Food! Tell me where to go!&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here for a little over 2 years and have tried a few places (Dosa Delight, Spicy Shallot, Melhfi, Chili Chicken / Himalayan Hut, SriPraiThai [sp?], Jax Inn, Cannelle, Filipino and Issan Thai restaurants on Roosevelt, the taco carts, the South Asian sweet shops, and a handful of others that I can&#039;t think of right now).&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t get to eat out as much as I&#039;d like.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to explore some new restaurants - so where would you suggest taking a friend for their first foray into the food of Jackson Heights? I&#039;d prefer somewhere a sit down place that&#039;s relatively cheap (dinner for 2 w/o drinks under $30) and within a 10 minute walk of the 74th St station.&nbsp; My go-to place to take people is Dosa Delight, and I love it, but I want to try something new and don&#039;t want to take a friend to a so-so place.&nbsp; So what would you suggest?&nbsp; I&#039;m open to any kind of cuisine. Thanks in advance!<br /><br />(And as a side note, if anyone has recs for a bar in the area that&#039;s not Ready Penny or Texas BBQ please share! I know that E77 serves alcohol but it&#039;s tiny and often too crowded.)

					When I went in to vote today at PS 69 I was met with the the traditional Thanksgiving holiday decorations - turkeys, cornucopias, leaves, and the like.&nbsp; Along with these decorations was a stylized image of an Indian holding a basket of corn and wearing a headband with a feather - right next to the images of the turkey, etc.&nbsp; I looked around and couldn&#039;t find anyone from the school to talk with so I took down the picture and brought it over to the security guard in the foyer and asked to speak with someone from the school.&nbsp; Nobody was available so I left a note explaining that the context of this image is offensive and it should not be on display.<br /><br />A few minutes later (as I was getting my ballot, no less) a woman who worked at the school rushed over to me, screaming, demanding to know why I took down the holiday decoration.&nbsp; I calmly explained that this image should NOT be used in a holiday display and that I find it offensive.&nbsp; This woman (I didn&#039;t get her name, unfortunately) said that I had no place to remove the image and that I have no say in what happens in the school because I don&#039;t work there and don&#039;t have a child in the school.&nbsp; I explained that I&#039;m a community member and I DO certainly have the right (and responsibility, IMO) to take part in ensuring that the children of our community are educated in a responsible, respectful manner.&nbsp; This woman (wish I had her name!) said that they do teach about Indians as part of history and stormed off.<br /><br />There are quite a few things that I found troubling in this exchange.<br />1) A stylized image of a nameless Native American should NOT be part of a holiday display which also includes images of a roasted turkey.<br />2) Teaching about Native Americans in the context of Thanksgiving - as part of history, a culture that existed only in the past - perpetuates the line of thinking that Native Americans are a historical, extinct culture which is not present in NYC.&nbsp; <br />3) The principal/school leaders/PTA/etc. should welcome the participation of ALL members of the community (particularly since they are a publicly-funded institution).<br />4) The woman who yelled at me did so WHILE I WAS VOTING and caused quite a dramatic scene in front of other voters and poll workers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I doubt that the people who hung up these decorations intended to offend anyone; however, for an educator NOT to recognize why this image is offensive (or, seek to enter a discussion about WHY this image may be perceived as offensive) is very troubling.&nbsp;

					Over the past couple of weeks I&#039;ve seen a cat roaming around on 75th St.&nbsp; It looks to be either quite chubby or pregnant.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely not a kitten, the cat is at least a year and a half to two years old.&nbsp; The cat is grayish/brownish on top and white on the bottom.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this cat?&nbsp; It&#039;s always in the same place (on 75th St. just north of 35th Ave.).&nbsp; Does it have a home?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have a collar.

					My car was broken into last night/this morning on 75th St btw 35th &amp; 37th.&nbsp; Fortunately the window was not broken and nothing was stolen.&nbsp; It&#039;s still disconcerting that this happened.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t look like any of the other cars on the block were harmed.&nbsp; I filed a police report.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced a car break-in in the area?&nbsp;
