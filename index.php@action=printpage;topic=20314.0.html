				My co-op currently does not allow dogs (cats are ok). <br />Before starting a petition, I wanted to find out which buildings in Jackson Heights allow dogs.&nbsp; <br />Are there specific conditions or requirements? Pet agreements? Size requirements?<br />Any other considerations?<br /><br />Thanks for any info!<br /><br />

				We are dog owners, in a pet friendly coop, but if you bought a place with a &quot;no dogs&quot; rule, <strong>so did others.</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s not fair to owners to change rules to their home.&nbsp;

				Dogs were allowed in our building up to 20 years ago when the board decided to change this rule. It might have been due to lazy and inconsiderate dog owners.<br /><br />The demographic of the building has changed a lot in the past decade and many neighbors have expressed interest in having dogs. I am only trying to assess whether the majority of our building is for or against changing this rule.

				Our co-op voted for a one-off exemption for someone to keep a dog temporarily.<br /><br />The trouble was that when left alone in the apartment the dog barked incessantly. <br /><br />And so I don&#039;t think the co-op will vote that way again...<br /><br />

				Our small coop recently approved the first dog in many years, but only after drawing up an agreement that specified what issues would trigger a request to the shareholder to find a new home for the dog. Our rules say dogs only by special permission, and I have heard that in the past there were dogs that did create noise and mess that bothered other tenants significantly. With most of us now working from home--and the kids here doing school at home--it&#039;s even more important that a dog not bark all day long and disrupt everyone. But we did approve the dog, which has recently arrived, and so far I&#039;ve not heard a peep out of her. And she&#039;s really cute. I hope it works out, but on the other hand, I do think that in a small coop it might be a problem if everyone had a dog. Especially if they were larger dogs, who might not only bark but also make considerable noise running around the apartment.

				Suzie.&nbsp; I have an idea the building you&#039;re referring to that stopped allowing dogs many years ago.&nbsp; Does this building have 145 units built in 1946 and is in the 80&#039;s?&nbsp; &nbsp;If this is the building, I&#039;m hoping that you and others can reverse this decision.<br /><br />

				Minimal4me:&nbsp; The building I was referring to is the Carlton House at 3441 85th St.&nbsp; The Board established the &quot;No Dog&quot; policy about 15 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m in a pet friendly coop, and our House Rules mostly cover dogs, but I know we have owners with cats and parrots. The rules are basically what you would expect - your dog can&#039;t be left to bark all day long, keep the dog on a leash at all times, don&#039;t let the dog in the landscaping (our board is particularly nasty and fined a shareholder who distractedly didn&#039;t notice that her tiny little dog peed on a fence rather than just sending a notice to remind the shareholder of the rule), owner is financially responsible for any damage your pet causes the coop, etc. We are expected to register pets iand have an emergency contact on file and dogs have to be up on their vaccinations.<br /><br />I heard there was talk maybe a decade ago about going pet-free, but people who buy in to a pet-friendly coop would be more likely to want the option of getting a pet in the future even if they don&#039;t currently have one, and I think making that change (which I guess is just a house rule) would probably lead to board members who voted in favor of changing the rules being voted out.
