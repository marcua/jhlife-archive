			There&#039;s a large construction site at 40-40 75th Street, just south of the subway station.&nbsp; According to the Department of Buildings, the new building will be 8 stories tall, and have 58 apartments.&nbsp; It will also include underground parking for 31 cars, and a store and a &quot;school&quot; (most likely a daycare facility, given its small size?) on the first floor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I couldn&#039;t find any renderings.

			So let&#039;s do the calculations...58 apartments...let&#039;s say everyone has at least one car...there are only 31 parking spots...where are those other 27 cars supposed to park?

			Avela, here&#039;s some different math for u:<br /><br />58 apartments, the majority of which the occupants will not have cars (I&#039;ll guesstimate at 60% without).&nbsp; So (I&#039;m bad at math, u may have to help me :-X) that would mean approx. 26 residents with cars.&nbsp; Which will leave 5 spots available for others in the vicinity!&nbsp; cool.<br /><br /><br />

			That&#039;s a good guestimate, Buddy.&nbsp; According to the 2000 Census, about 61% of households in the 11372 area code did not own a vehicle.&nbsp; &nbsp;This includes houses far away from transit with their own driveways... the figure is probably a lot higher for apartments right next to the subway.
