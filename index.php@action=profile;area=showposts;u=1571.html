					Because of such noise and unnecessary loitering causing pain,&nbsp; I was told to get a hearing test at the NY Eye and Ear Infirmary.&nbsp; I might be slightly hearing difficient on one side.&nbsp; And I hardly listen to music and if at all at the lowest level.&nbsp; I have to call 212-979-4340 to set an appt.&nbsp; Hope all is fine.<br /><br />There should be traffic police for a while who also direct public out away from the streets so cars can keep on moving.&nbsp; There should be a limit to the loitering outside residential buildings.&nbsp; I was shocked to see a couple eating food inside out lobby.&nbsp; I asked them if they lived here, apparently not.&nbsp; May be we should also have translated signs saying no loitering.&nbsp; Just walking out of the subway is so difficult for more than a block and half.&nbsp; The men dont move.&nbsp; They dont understand what excuse me means.&nbsp; Instead he yelled at me saying Squeeze ME! Squeeze Me!&nbsp; Our Neighborhood was never this inconsiderate before.&nbsp; I just see men chatting away without realizing people need to pass through. Their driving is horrible too.&nbsp; I dont think they unstand what DOnt honking means.&nbsp; I think it should be said it different languages, so they should understand. Ive seen so many signs near Duane Reade and cars simoky ignoring it.&nbsp; I hate it especially when they honk in your face.&nbsp; Thats them abusing my ears.&nbsp; I think ill go deaf soon.<br /><br />For the old Jackson Heighters who have lived during the quiet days of our streets, we must so sometime.&nbsp; we simply must.<br /><br /><br />PS Besides perhaps going deaf, i didnt have my reading glasses while typing.&nbsp; Pardon me on my typos and errors.<br /><br />

					I am so scared of my building turning into buildings that I have heard of-- multiple families living in ONE apartment.<br /><br />My old family friends have complained that in their building (near 72 St and 37th Ave),have more than 75% of the apartments over the past few years have up to five families living in each unit.&nbsp; In fact last year, there was a fire in corner 2nd or 3rd floor of that building.&nbsp; It is very dangerous.&nbsp; I feel bad for my family friends because they have been living there for more than 25 years and to see their building turn into&nbsp; that must be very difficult.&nbsp; I told my super about this.&nbsp; He was astonished to hear how that many people can live in one apartment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Imagine, if there are 5 families and perhaps each family having a kid or two, how do they sleep?&nbsp; I also believe this is the reason for our over crowded schools.&nbsp; We have too many families living here in such a small area.&nbsp; Its not healthy.&nbsp; I feel bad for the kids.&nbsp; If I cannot find a spot at the library to sit at, how can they study at home? <br /><br />And this building I am speaking of, I heard the landlady takes a 5 month deposit?&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; Does that mean she knows what&#039;s going on and taking advantage of the situation? <br /><br />About 2-3 weeks ago, I heard of such another building near P.S.69Q towards Roosevelt.&nbsp; I felt bad for the family witnessing such a happening.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />About the fliers, I can not seen any such fliers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, wouldnt the post office have a hint at how many people are living in one apartment?<br /><br />

					I also use the Exercise On Demand (channel 1025 time warner) when I cant go to the gym.<br /><br />Best time to do that is before taking a shower for work in the morning.&nbsp; You feel more fresh and more active leaving your home. Plus your abs look more in tone at work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any 10 minute workout is enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy!

					Lucielle Roberts is around $325 with a 2 year contract.&nbsp; If you want to do monthly its around $10-12 per month and every 6 months a maintenance fee of I think 10-15 dollars.<br /><br />I use to go to the one on Steinway hopping on the G,V or R train to Steinway.&nbsp; I paid $40 bucks more to upgrade to gold, meaning I can use other gyms.&nbsp; So now I frequent the one on 71 Continental, a one express stop towards Jamaica.&nbsp; Both take me 10 minutes to get to by train.<br /><br />First use a free 5 day pass and see if you like the gym.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use to be a NY Sports Club member, but that can cost to more than $100 a month.&nbsp; Over there, I would get a new towel, sometimes shampoo, (key locker-some locations) and massages.&nbsp; Big difference in machines.&nbsp; I remember their running machines had headphone pug-in to listen to their own tv network.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some gyms are 24/7.&nbsp; Try the out before paying.&nbsp; Also just for canceling my NY Sports Club membership within 2 years, I got charged around $175 and an extra month since their policy is to tell them one month in advance.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you need any further information, feel free to message me. <br /><br />Also, taking classes with your friends is fun.&nbsp; The classes at 71 Continental get very very packed.&nbsp; Perhaps 100+.&nbsp; Its not as crowded at Steinway. Both have waiting lists for the Elliptical during rush hours.&nbsp; Ask the reps when both get busy.<br /><br /><br /><br />

					I thought the World Ice Arena was open during the summer too.&nbsp; According to the article i found it is:<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://mommypoppins.com/ny-kids/5-best-ice-skating-rinks-for-nyc-kids" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://mommypoppins.com/ny-kids/5-best-ice-skating-rinks-for-nyc-kids</a><br /><br />Ice Skating Rinks in New York City<br />NOV 10 2009&nbsp; BY MOMMY<br /><br />There are lots of places to go ice skating in New York if you don&#039;t mind waiting on long lines or skating shoulder to shoulder with rowdy teenagers. We&#039;ve picked out the best indoor and outdoor ice skating rinks in New York City where you can avoid the lines and the crowds (at least some of the time). All of these places offer ice skating lessons and ice skating birthday parties and almost all of them even offer hockey. Check each website link for additional information.<br />Bryant Park ice skating rink isn&#039;t a secret any more and it certainly gets decent sized crowds. The best time to go is early in the season, before Thanksgiving, when the weather is fine and the crowds are too. Later in the season stick to after school before 5pm and weekend mornings before noon to and you&#039;ll have virtually no lines or crowds.<br />Open: November 6, 2009-January 24, 2010<br />Hours: 8am-10pm, (till midnight on Fridays and Saturdays)<br />Cost: Free entrance, skate rental $12<br /><br />Chelsea Piers Sky Rink is the place to go if you just gotta skate even though it&#039;s raining, freezing or 90 degrees outside. The two giant indoor rinks are only available for free skating during the afternoons. The rest of the time they are hosting hockey games and skating lessons. In the summer Chelsea Piers offers free skate rental on weekends: a great way to beat the heat.<br />Open: Year-round<br />Hours: Varies by day, but generally afternoons.<br />Cost: Adults $13, Kids $10.50, Skate Rental $4<br /><br />Most people don&#039;t even know about Riverbank Skate Park, let alone that it has an ice skating rink, affording some of the least crowded ice skating in NYC. Riverbank State Park is just a block from the 145th street 9 train stop and also has playground athletic facilities and a swimming pool. We did a post on the Ice Hockey Program offered here.<br />Open: November - March<br />Hours: Call for hours: (212) 694-3600<br />Cost: Adults $5, Kids $3<br /><br />Lasker Rink is my personal favorite place to skate. I find it to be the perfect combination of easy to get to, inexpensive, and uncrowded. You can take the 2/3 or C/B and it&#039;s just a short block right into the northern tip of central park. Make it into a whole day with ideas from our Northern Central Park excursion post. Opens after Thanksgiving.<br />Open: November - March<br />Hours: Check site for hours<br />Cost: Adults $6.25, Kids $3.50, Skate Rental $5.50<br />&nbsp;<br />Prospect Park has its own ice skating rink. The rink is huge and I like this rink best for a child&#039;s ice skating party. Opens after Thanksgiving.<br />Open: November 26- March 14<br />Hours: Check site for hours<br />Cost: Adults $5, Kids $3, Skate Rental $6.50 (half price admissions every non-holiday Friday)<br />&nbsp;<br />Queens has two beautiful indoor Ice Skating rinks that are great for all sorts of winter outings. They both hold figure skating and hockey lessons and have frequent open sessions:<br />The <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>World Ice Arena</strong></span></span></span> is located inside of Flushing Meadow Park and is attached to the Aquatic center. They have everything from birthday parties to private lessons and the place has plenty of seating for the not so adventerous parent.&nbsp; If seeing people skate around is more your style then check out the World Ice Arenaâ€™s upcoming events section for a list of figure skating performances.<br />Open: Year-round<br />Hours: Weekdays, 9am-5:15pm, Weekends 12-4:45pm<br />Cost: Weekdays $5, Weekends $8, Skate Rental $5<br />The other rink is the <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>City Ice Pavilion</strong></em></span></span> (in Long Island City. It is located by LaGuardia College and the opening to the 59th Street Bridge. They also host parties and have lessons for the budding figure skaters and Wayne Gretskys.<br />Open: Year-round<br />Hours: Check site for hours<br />Cost: Weekdays $5, Weekends $8, Skate Rental $6

					Any more big belly sightings?<br /><br />If we don&#039;t have enough funds for it then perhaps we can place advertisements of local businesses of the neighbor hood on it.&nbsp; Kinda like buses but more local?<br /><br />How can we request more?

					I&#039;m so happy Rahman didn&#039;t win. &nbsp;:laugh: &nbsp;I got a weird phone call the day before and one thing, the lady asked me was about -- what was my religion? &nbsp;Hello! &nbsp;I don&#039;t like it if people judge me because of my religion. &nbsp;:coolsmiley: &nbsp;Thats the reason I did not vote for him. &nbsp;Also because I tried googling him and if he was so serious, then, his work should have been on the internet about how he has contributed for us instead of make money as a businessman. &nbsp;All because you have a business here, doesn&#039;t mean you have great community giving back skills. &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /><br />If you look at my old posts, I hate pollution of any kind, e.g., littering and noise. &nbsp;Im not very fond of how the neighborhood has changed especially over the past 5 years with all the illegal vendors, and multiple garbage trucks visiting my streets in the middle of the night waking us up. &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt="&#58;o" title="Shocked" class="smiley" /> I doubt he had any solutions for this since their party destroyed trees. &nbsp;:tickedoff: That, I am sooooo against.... ( I am one of those people, who have requested multiple of trees to surround 73 street and 72 street). &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I cant wait until our neighborhood around 74 St. becomes beautiful, clean, and orderly as it once was. &nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />(By the way I worked for the elections. &nbsp;Some EDs had a greater turn out than others. &nbsp;The one I worked for had a 44% turn out. &nbsp;I did try to tell voters about the proposals on the bottom right had side. They had a leaflet about it too, which I did try to offer when possible.)<br /><br />I wish good luck to our new elected leader Mr.Dromm! &nbsp; :rockon:

					But if you look at the license plates around 74st, they are from out-of-state.&nbsp; We, the people who live here, realized long time ago, not to even dream of a car unless you want to be on a waiting list for your buildings indoor spots and shell out $200 a month. I think with a $81/mo metro card you get more sky-miles/car-miles too.&nbsp; :rockon:<br /><br />I just cant wait till they fix all the train lines though.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" />
