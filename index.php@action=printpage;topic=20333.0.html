				The survey makes some loaded assumptions, but I recommend anyone with concerns to work through it and fill out the comments. I am not opposed if someone man&#039;s the barricades during the open period. While the volunteers have done a good job opening and closing the street, someone needs to be there to provide access to local traffic and prevent abuses by vehicles, bicyclists, and electric scooters.

I did manage to get into the comments my feeling that I&#039;m actually safer walking on the sidewalk than I am in the Open Street, as I feel like I constantly have to watch my back for speeding bikes, scooters and e-bikes.<br /><br />I forgot to mention in my comments that I feel that making drivers get out to move barriers to enter their block (say, if they live on that block or have a garage entrance on that block) is unfair. This is especially true for elderly or disabled drivers. Even though I neglected to put the comments in the survey, I did send an email to the DOT about a month ago expressing that sentiment.<br /><br />During the worst of the pandemic shut down days, I did enjoy some of those walking experiences when I had nowhere to go except to walk around the block, but I think perhaps there weren&#039;t as many crazed two-wheeled vehicles in those days. When Covid really does finally wind down, I don&#039;t think I will need or use the Open Street at all. I know others hold different opinions.<br /><br />If they are going to keep the Open Streets program, they really need to address some major issues. IMHO of course. :)

				<br />It doesn&#039;t matter what the age is. You&#039;re trying to argue with me about a point I did not make.<br /><br />My point is that some drivers have trouble getting out of the car and moving things like metal barriers. It doesn&#039;t mean that those same people are confused and mentally challenged and shouldn&#039;t be driving.<br /><br />I&#039;m done with the discussion.

There is no need to be ageist or ableist. Many people depend on their cars because they are physically unable to use other forms of transportation. Any fair transportation proposal has to account for their needs, not just the joggers and Zumba dancers. 34th Avenue is one of the few through streets that connect with the Grand Central parkway. Why not close 32nd Avenue instead, which goes only from Woodside Ave to 94th Street? Sure it&#039;s less convenient, but if you&#039;re looking for more exercise, what&#039;s a few more blocks?

				Back to the survey, agree with comment that the survey was poorly designed and definitely seemed skewed to only usage of Open Street vs. concerns for the greater quality of life impacted both on 34th Avenue and neighboring streets.&nbsp; I completed it as best as possible to address my concerns and usage.&nbsp; Recent day time walks during the week on 34th Avenue, there has not been that many people, I did see a vendor at 82nd and some gentleman with bags full of cans of beer--if I lived on that street a place to congregate and get drunk.&nbsp; There was plenty space to walk ON the sidewalk and at the same time Travers Park was empty.&nbsp; With all the attention to Open Streets, would be great if our community leaders and DOT focused on cleaning up the streets, monitoring traffic congestion and noise, and making JH more livable for all.
