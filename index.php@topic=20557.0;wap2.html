			Today I was walking down 81st Street and noticed that a lot of the windows at the Chateau were in bad shape and unsightly.&nbsp; I was surprised because I always thought of the Chateau as one of the premier buildings in JH.&nbsp; Has anyone else noticed this?&nbsp; Is each building managed separately or is the entire complex part of one Homeowners Association?

			Yes, I have noticed this for quite some time.&nbsp; I imagine the expense to remedy would be quite high.&nbsp; Still, those are some beautiful buildings even if most of the windows are in dire need of scraping and a fresh coat of paint.&nbsp;

			Each Chateau building is a separate coop, and I’ve also noticed that the quality of the windows (in particular the paint, but storm windows, too) varies by building. Perhaps erecting scaffolding just to strip and repaint only to solve for a cosmetic problem is a tall order. But I’d certainly get an estimate if I were a resident.&nbsp; <br /><br />Meanwhile, the Greystones (also separate coops, albeit less ritzy) seem to have spiffier, fresh green paint. Perhaps they can recommend a contractor to the Chateau’s management company!<br /><br /><br /><br />

			I think first thing to point out is that Chateau buildings are landmarked and the windows must be replaced in accordance with landmark rules. They must match the paint color , shape etc... To the best of my knowledge, these types of custom windows are very expensive. It must vary from building to building, but the client I have in the Chateau redid his windows at his own expense, it was not an all-building project. <br /><br />you can see the windows in the listing: https://corenyc.com/property/34-37-80th-st-52-3212927/

But Armen, from the looks of it, your client’s windows swing open on hinges rather than raise with sliders like other windows on the building. Perhaps there’s a bit more flexibility there on the part of the landmark rule keepers that could enable replacements that are either less costly or more functional.
