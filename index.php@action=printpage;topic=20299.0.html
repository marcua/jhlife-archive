				State Senator Jessica Ramos is co-sponsoring this bill, which would place a $3 surcharge on every package ordered online, with the exception of food and medicine. Thoughts?<br /><br />https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/new-yorkers-may-have-to-pay-package-delivery-surcharge-to-help-fund-mta/2767045/?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand&amp;amp&amp;fbclid=IwAR3acRIQxDyHXMTwQMDSKtiejZS0Df9i4SuHUI2I1K4KyeUrvq3SRiV54Rs<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/2gmKbxI.png)

				While I agree with the premise, and I strongly believe that taxation is the price of civilization, I oppose the idea that residents having to close all budgetary gaps from their pockets. Why not find a different source of revenue, say, a corporate one? Amazon fared much better in this pandemic than residents in our neighborhood, for ex. I also note that residents are already paying a surcharge for restaurants, increase costs, receive significant reduction in services, etc.

				I think Ramos has done great work during the pandemic, but disagree with her on this highly regressive proposal. Our representatives should be laser-focused on raising revenue by first increasing taxes on our native millionaires and billionaires (who, by the way, enjoyed huge windfalls from the Trump tax cuts).

				The other co-sponsor, Robert Carroll, lives in or near the Kensington area of Brooklyn, which I imagine is well stocked with stores where people can shop locally. I wonder if either of the co-sponsors have bothered to consider that not all areas of NYC are well served with stores. It seems like just yesterday Ramos was talking about certain areas of NYC being &quot;food deserts&quot; so surely she understands the concept that not all areas are alike in terms of their amenities for shopping.<br /><br />The other group that it would hurt more than others are seniors and those with limited mobility. I remember when I had a broken foot, it was not at all easy to go out and shop. To add insult to injury, this is the same population that most likely gets much less out of the MTA since the MTA is so disability-unfriendly.

However, this is a tax that would be directly targeting people who absolutely need to shop online at a greater rate than others (due to disabilities/age) and channeling that money into something that they can&#039;t use. I don&#039;t see how that makes good sense. I guess you disagree.<br /><br />Even if the money weren&#039;t being used to fund the MTA, it still wouldn&#039;t be fair to target people who need to shop online.<br /><br />It also targets small businesses, who need to buy supplies and inventory online and have it delivered by UPS, etc. There&#039;s been a lot of awareness lately about how small businesses are suffering, so I also don&#039;t see how it makes sense to make them take an even larger financial hit.

				We either live in New York City or we don&#039;t. There is always a choice.<br /><br />The subway is a vital part of NYC.

				<br /><br />It&#039;s a life of relentless, small-minded ennui outside of NYC.<br /><br />For businesses and for citizens.<br /><br />The premium it costs financially to live in NYC is always worth it. Including a new $3 surcharge on packages. <br /><br />

				How about going after Amazon and making them pay more in taxes? This is extremely regressive. Imagine someone who gets 1 package a week, 52 packages a year. That&#039;s $156 a year in fees. If you make $30k that&#039;s 0.5% of your income. If you make $100k it&#039;s 0.16% of your income. (Feel free to check my math! I might be wrong!) People making less money pay more for the same service, that&#039;s regressive. (Same could be said about sales taxes.) It&#039;s shameful to propose this during the pandemic when we&#039;re encouraged to stay home as much as possible!<br /><br />JR has been very vocal about her support for a billionaires tax - maybe this is a move to drum up support for that among regular folks who think this $3/package proposal is ridiculous.

				City &amp; State provides some helpful context for this bill:<br />https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/bill-no-one-wants-pass-during-pandemic.html<br /><br />I&#039;m definitely sympathetic to the goal of reducing the amount of packages &amp; delivery trucks on our streets. Just seems like a $3 surcharge is not necessarily the best way to accomplish that, and it&#039;s a politically terrible time to roll out new consumer taxes.

				I think this is a terrible idea.&nbsp; Do you still have to pay the surcharge if your package is stolen???<br /><br />In any case many people will have their packages shipped elsewhere to avoid this &quot;tax&quot;.&nbsp; Since I have other options there is no way I would pay to have a package delivered to me.

				I&#039;m also against this proposal.&nbsp; We don&#039;t need another nuisance tax.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that a politician would even suggest such a proposal when you consider there are so many voters in their district who enjoy and prefer shopping online.&nbsp; Why upset those who voted for you.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t imagine Councilman Dromm suggesting such a proposal knowing how many in Jackson Heights shop online who voted for the Councilman.&nbsp; A little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;
