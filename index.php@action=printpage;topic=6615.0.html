				Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;m a writer and I live in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m working on an article about the Jackson Heights Greenmarket for Edible Queens. It would be great to hear from some of you about the market. The article will appear in the winter issue so I&#039;d really like to know about your experiences shopping at the market last winter and what you&#039;re looking forward to this winter. <br /><br />While it will be cool for this to be a thread, if any of you are willing to be quoted in the piece, I ask that you send me a private message and include your full name (as opposed to a handle). <br /><br />I have no sway with the Greenmarket, so there is no need to ask me about whether or not we&#039;ll get another poultry farmer (though I sure hope we do!). But in the years that I&#039;ve been regularly shopping at our Sunday market, I&#039;ve really been impressed by how much it has grown since going year-round last winter. And talking to farmers and the Greenmarket folks, it seems that our market is a resounding success.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some questions to consider should you want to play along:<br /><br />How does the presence of the market influence your shopping habits? <br /><br />What items are you thrilled to get during the winter? <br /><br />What are your thoughts on how the market functions as a community hub?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think it&#039;s awesome, I&#039;m really proud how big our market is. I&#039;m trying to schedule going to the market myslef on Sundays and am making an effort to hold it off til then. I want it to get massively popular, and I think the key to that is it being a community hub - in other ways, and then people would buy groceries as a coincidence. would they hire me??

				The Greenmarket is great. The logistics of getting to the vendors tables is somewhat problematic - cobblestones, crowds, strollers, walkers, in other words it is SO popular that there are traffic jams!

				We are using the Greenmarket as an axis for all of our food shopping. If we can get it there and it&#039;s in the plan/budget or whim, we prefer<br />to make the purchase at the market. Try to experiment with something new each week and eat some stuff that not so great for you along<br />with some that&#039;s fantastically healthy hoping it all evens out. The selection is impressive especially since, as others have said, it&#039;s so new.<br />The food has taste! and this is something hard to get used to when the summer ends most of the time. But now we can consider ourselves<br />fortunate to have these year round choices. Thanks to everyone who works to make this happen.<br />&nbsp; Two wishes, if I may. One is to allow the food vendors around the sides to have a real home at some place in the market. Am not sure<br />what the protocol is here but some of the food is fantastic. Second is a place to sit. And I don&#039;t know where this is except in the street<br />or to take a slice of room away from the inside of the asphalt in Travers Park maybe? I know everyone enjoyed the tables farther down<br />on Playstreet and even when it was otherwise quiet, someone was always sitting at a table.

				It&#039;s the best thing to happen to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I love how it has grown and expanded.&nbsp; My wish (a selfish one at that) is that it expands even more and into Travers Park.&nbsp; I would love to see Playstreet and Travers Park completely overtaken by the Greenmarket.&nbsp; It is only one day a week, afterall, and it has become vital to the community--and, the more it expands the more popular it will become.&nbsp; Thanks to all those who have done such a great job with it.&nbsp;

				I agree with Jack I would love for it to expand. I don&#039;t think it could expand inside the park (I.E. the Basketball/tennis area) because of the numerous games and activities in the warmer months. I love the produce/products and love talking with the vendors. I watched it grow over the years and look forward to Sundays!!
