				This home is definitely spectacular but I think it is a hard sell at this price.&nbsp; Are there any comps in the area for this price?&nbsp; Not even a powder room on the first floor for a seven figure price!&nbsp; if it doesn&#039;t appraise at close to the listing price the down payment will be even greater than the 20% number of $250K.&nbsp; Even if it is an investment with 2 apartments the numbers don&#039;t come close to covering the cost.

				@eddiestjohns, agreed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen the place and while it is nice (great kitchen!), it is only zoned as a two-family and I doubt there would be any comps in the area that could support the appraisal and proper bank financing. Also, the home is not land marked.&nbsp; <br /><br />The &quot;short-stroll&quot; to the subway is over a half-mile away. <br /><br />I doubt even the highest end, larger English garden homes on 87th st. with beautiful back yards would be able to command such a high price in this market. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t this house listed with another agency before?&nbsp;

				Mortgage rates are at a 50 year low but how much longer can they remain low. &nbsp;Most likely for a year or two. &nbsp;If mortgage rates go to 6% that&#039;s a 30% increase; 7% is a 52% increase and 8% a 74% increase. &nbsp;I would rather pay 8% in three years and purchase a home for 35% less than lock in at 4.6% especially if I didn&#039;t plan on keep the house, cooperative or condo for more than 8 years which is about the National Average. &nbsp;
