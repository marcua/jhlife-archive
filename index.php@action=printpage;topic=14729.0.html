Come see what CSA is all about! Meet some of your Jackson Heights neighbors!<br />Raffle of a Golden Earthworm t-shirt and tote bag!<br /><br />Farm Spot is the Jackson Heights CSA and has been running for 10 years. At the end of May, we will begin our 11th year! CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) is a model where neighborhood groups partner with a local farm. Each member of the group pre-pays for a share of the farm’s bounty. This model is beneficial to everyone! It gives the farmers a guaranteed income, which they receive upfront, when they need it most; it gives each member very fresh, affordable, organic produce that was grown locally (in our case, the farm is 70 miles away), and also a chance to get to know our farm and our farmers).<br /><br />Maggie and Matt will talk about the history of the farm, which is in Jamesport, Long Island. She will also discuss how a CSA works, the many different types of vegetables grown on the farm, the challenges of running a certified organic farm, who works on the farm, and much more! <br /><br />There will be a raffle of a Golden Earthworm t-shirt and tote bag which will be announced at 6:45pm!<br /><br />Stop by with your questions and curiosity about CSA. Farm Spot is now taking new members for the 2016 season, which starts at the end of May.<br /><br />All are welcome!!<br /><br />farmspot@gmail.com<br /></span>
