				I&#039;ve been a lifelong vegetarian and vegan for several years and buy some items here and there in the neighborhood but for the most part, I go into Manhattan or Astoria for vegan takeout and or groceries. Today I am feeling under the weather and was thinking&nbsp; I would love some spicy soup. I tried several places on Northern and nobody has options. Black thai refused to make me anything without fish sauce saying that&#039;s how it comes.&nbsp; Anyone have any places they order from locally?

I believe Samudra will customize their vegetarian menu to accommodate, and someone on this board said the same of Angel, both of which deliver. soups don&#039;t seem to be a strong point for either, though.<br /><br />

				El Rico Tinto has a vegetarian section of its menu, but I&#039;ve never checked if it is truly vegetarian/vegan.&nbsp; It might be worth checking with them.<br /><br />Also, the vegetarian Indian restaurant Angel (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19433.0) has been gaining fans.<br /><br />
