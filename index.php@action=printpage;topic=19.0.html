				As I was walking on 76th Street today, I passed Jackson Towers between 37th and Roosevelt and happened to notice a sign posted in a first floor apartment window that said &quot;garage for rent&quot; with a phone number 718-426-4677.&nbsp; I saw this today, Nov. 1.&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for garage space in the area, you might want to go take a look and see if the sign is still up.&nbsp; I know garage spaces are hard to find.

				What are the parking options in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; There is a garage at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue but the price with taxes included is $300.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even get your own spot the attendant parks and retrieves your car so with tips it will cost you even more than that.

				I know someone who rents a space from the garage in a nearby coop building (not her own), but I&#039;m not sure how she got this space.<br /><br />Also in my walks around the neighborhood I have seen handwritten signs posted on the windows of houses or apartments advertising what might be a private driveway space.&nbsp; I recently posted one in the classified section that I saw on an apartment building on 76th St.&nbsp; I also saw another sign in Elmhurst a few weeks ago just across Roosevelt Ave on either Gleane or Forley on the right hand side just after you cross Roosevelt.<br /><br />Since it&#039;s time consuming to pound the pavement, I will write down info when I come across it from now on and post it in the classifieds - if it would be some help to people.

				I&#039;m interested in renting a garage spot, but I have no idea how this process works. Can anyone provide some input on where to look for rentals?

				86th and Roosevelt parking lot is 24/7 but they want $200 per month. I get the feeling you could negotiate the price down a little with them. Since I moved here in August I haven&#039;t really had much problems aside from the fliers. Even parking itself is easier than Astoria was since I only have to move the car once a week.

				Sorry I posted without prices:&nbsp; Our building charges $175 a month plus one month&#039;s Security Deposit.&nbsp; You get back your Security if you leave giving one month&#039;s notice.&nbsp; $50 for an electronic remote garage door opener and $5 for a key to the opposite side door.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure the buildings next door are competitive with these prices.&nbsp; Also there are always vacancies and a waiting list.&nbsp; Once in awhile, like now, a spot opens and there&#039;s no waiting list.

				Buddy, how on earth did the Board convince the shareholders in your co-op to lease parking spaces in the garage to non-residents?&nbsp; Is it that the vast majority of residents don&#039;t own cars?&nbsp; I know that if our Board proposed that in my co-op, there would be a tremendous outcry.

				This co-op has always been more &quot;relaxed&quot; than most others.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;ve been the Board President for about 15 years, over those years the other Board members have been comprised of Investors and Resident Shareholders so every one has a point of view that reflects what they want.&nbsp; I would prefer that we have no Investor/Shareholders but I doubt that will ever change as long as some are on the Board. I have Shareholders who live in the building AND own apartments in the building that they rent out.&nbsp; &nbsp;So our garage is also relaxed.&nbsp; New Shareholders who have a car and want a spot in our garage, automatically go to the top of the Waiting list but we never evict anyone to give them a spot.&nbsp; They get the next spot available.&nbsp; If we have spots available and no shareholders or sublet tenants (plus we still have 11 original renters here) then anyone can rent a spot.&nbsp; Spots come available regularly enough that it&#039;s never been a problem.&nbsp; Amazing, huh?<br /><br />Despite it maybe sounding like the building is a free for all - far from it.&nbsp; We have historically had great people living here no matter their status.&nbsp; So because of that, the status quo of how we run the building stays the same.&nbsp; Most people are happy here and then there are always a few shareholders who are a pain in the a** and are never happy.&nbsp; That&#039;s life.&nbsp; Bottom line: we have a nice building to live in.&nbsp; Not snooty.

				Thanks for your response Buddy.&nbsp; Our building is pretty relaxed as well, but even so, I can&#039;t ever see a time when we have not had enough residents&nbsp; interested in leasing a parking space in the garage.&nbsp; Our co-op maintains a rather lengthy waiting list, so any openings in the garage go to the next in line.&nbsp; If that particular person doesn&#039;t own a car as of yet, then they are given a 30 day grace period to attain one.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t happen, the space automatically goes to the next person on the list.&nbsp; This plan seems to be working out well with all residents, as we haven&#039;t had any significant disputes to date.&nbsp; My husband is also board president in our co-op, and he, along with his fellow board members have pretty much established a great avenue for communication between the Board and the shareholders.&nbsp; As a result of this, most shareholders have voiced that they would prefer to keep the garage open only to residents.

				Agree with Buddy...

				I used to live on that block and we parked for a few years at the lot on Roosevelt b/w 78 &amp; 79. Your car will get dirty from being under the 7 and they have to maneuver it in and out for you (open 24 hours as far as I recall). I had considered renting a private garage but the alleyways seemed kind of sketchy to me.&nbsp; After a while, we realized that our &quot;failure rate&quot; (as measured in parking tickets) was less than the monthly parking rate, so we stopped paying for parking and just paid tickets here and there. I am not sure how much the lot is now, because I haven&#039;t parked there since 2005 and the rates have gone up.&nbsp; Also, you will probably not have that much trouble parking if you use your car every day and are not parked during alternate side of the street parking anyway.&nbsp;

				Every week there have been flyers on the cars (at least along 77th Street). Just walk down the street and grab one from one of the cars. This week they were yellow. I think they might use a different color each week.

				Thanks for the reply,<br /><br />We are trying to stay away from that typical garage and hoping to get lucky and have a &quot;spot&quot; in a apartment building garage instead.&nbsp; Calling every time we needed the car to be pulled out seems like a bit much and would feel more comfortable in an apt building garage.&nbsp; Too bad we couldn&#039;t think ahead and get a coop apt with a garage when we moved here a few months back&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; I also called the garage and they said it would be $300 month for a new vehicle which is ridiculous.<br /><br />Does anyone know the name or number of the management company of the apartment building with garage at 79-10 35th ave?&nbsp; That would be the ideal!&nbsp; Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks

				Greetings everybody!<br /><br />I live on 80 st and 37 ave in Jackson Heights and I need a parking spot! Preferably indoors!<br /><br />I have been parking at 82 St Parking Garage, located at 8213 37th Ave. I advise you stay away from this place! I have been parking there for almost a year now and have had an awful experience with them. I started paying 275 cash for them to park it upstairs and it would always end up with bird crap on it. I would get a car wash drop it off and the next day I would need another wash because there would be bird crap all over it. To combat the birds its seems like they kept a few cats around BUT then the cats would make it even worse! The slept on my hood for warmth from the engine and ended up scratching my whole hood! <br /><br />After getting my hood painted I decided to step it up a knotch and began paying 315 a month to avoid any more costs for repairs. For 40 dollars more they parked the car downstairs and &quot;claimed&quot; it was safer. But there seems to have been a leak from a ceiling and it dropped white old paint onto my car which is not coming off?!?! And of course the workers exonerate themselves from any liability and the boss seems to never be around so you cannot complain to him directly. <br /><br />On top of that I always tipped when I had a dollar bill in my pocket, at least 80% of the times. You think they would take better care of my car... BUT no! My front and back bumpers got so scratched up that I had to pull out my bumper bully every time I left them the car. My front bumper even has blue scuff marks... the color of their cushion on the walls!!!!!!!!!!!!! And they still deny any responsibilty!!!<br /><br />I NEED A PARKING SPOT!!!<br /><br />I am willing to pay cash and up front. If you got any info please call me at 646 302 8879<br />Marko is my name. <br /><br />Good luck parking in Jackson Heights! :&#039;(<br />

				After living here with a car for 6 years, parking on the street the entire time (not without incident and hassle, admittedly), I got my first ticket for an &quot;alternate side parking&quot; (street sweeping) time violation about a month ago.&nbsp; The fee was $45.&nbsp; &nbsp; At that rate you&#039;re looking at $180/four weeks if you just leave your car on the street.&nbsp; And if you manage to move it to the opposite side on schedule, it&#039;s $0/week.&nbsp; Of course, you should factor in gas for finding a space, and it may take a few months to uncover the hidden science of space tracking.&nbsp; But if I had been paying $300/month for that time I would be $21,600 poorer.&nbsp; Or by the Co-op parking I&#039;d be $10,000 poorer.&nbsp; That certainly dwarfs the cost of the occasional mirror-replacements I&#039;ve had to deal with (the driver&#039;s side mirror has been knocked off two or three times).&nbsp; Just don&#039;t keep anything valuable in the car.&nbsp; And if you can&#039;t get home to move it on schedule, think of what you&#039;re saving and have another beer.<br /><br />

				$300 / month is ridiculous.&nbsp; I pay $120 / month to park in a private spot behind a house on 72nd Street...other spots I found while looking were in that same ballpark, as are others that have been posted on this bulletin board in the past.<br /><br />I have a new car that I don&#039;t want ravaged by bad parallel parking, and during the summer I need to drive it every day for work.&nbsp; Finding parking every day, sometimes twice a day, really sucks, as does moving for street cleaning.&nbsp; At this point I have more money than time, so it is well worth the cost to rent the spot!&nbsp; Of course you can always find parking somewhere, but there is something to be said for the convenience of a guaranteed location for your car.

				There is the indoor lot with an entrance at 82nd and 37th, and an exit at 81st and 37th.&nbsp; It&#039;s pricey though.

				I have a driveway parking spot available on Britton Ave and Judge st $100 monthly between the hours of 9pm-7am. You can leave the car in the spot all day, though another driver parks behind you from 9am -6pm and you will not be able to use your vehicle due to you being blocked in. Tuesday and Sunday you spot to yourself, 2 blocks from Elmhurst Hospital and 3 Blocks from train station - 7 line.
