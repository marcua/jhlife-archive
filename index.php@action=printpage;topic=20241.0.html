				Thought it might be a good idea to compile a list of eating and drinking establishments in and around the neighborhood with heated outdoor areas. I was in Manhattan the other day and noticed several heated patios and sidewalk extensions with infrared lamps. Has anyone encountered anything of the sort around here?

				&nbsp;I think this restaurant may have been called the Blue Water Grill on Union Square and they had a raised outdoor seating area and people sat with the heat lamps in pretty low temps as I recall. Looked<br />strangely cozy.

				TimeOut NY posted this list in a Google doc a few days ago: <br /><br />https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mhRXl_kWn1n5HESNwSsDbHOpYyxFsSbVGdTUiBAicE8/edit<br /><br />It&#039;s centered on Manhattan (o&#039;course), and the QNS section doesn&#039;t have any JH restos (yet), only LIC, Astoria, and Forest Hills. That said, they&#039;ll supposedly update with reader input, so it&#039;s worth a try sending them what you know about all our great dining venues trying to make it through these constantly changing conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				will be interesting to see how long it takes for someone to think putting heating lamps in one of those *fully enclosed* outdoor dining spaces is a good idea. And how long it&#039;s going to take for the crackdown on those spaces to start. The guidelines seem pretty clear and easily found online - if you&#039;re going to fully enclose the space, you have to limit capacity to 25%.

				i&#039;m seeing a handful of structures that seem to violate the rules by being fully enclosed, made of impermeable material like plywood with plexiglass windows. those aren&#039;t outdoor in the least. the new &quot;health food&quot; joint on Roosevelt and 76th comes to mind, along with a couple of places down near Roosevelt and 61st.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve noticed quite a few. The new spot Helenas&#039;s I think is fully enclosed. Margarita&#039;s as well. I mean, I have a certain sympathy for confusion, but it&#039;s pretty clear what the guidelines are if you just bother to use the Google.&nbsp; It&#039;s not exactly a leap to replace &quot;tent&quot; with &quot;more substantial enclosure made from wood and plastic siding.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t understand why you&#039;d spend money on supplies and labor to build structures that are going to be a problem once inspectors start coming around. Don&#039;t know if fines could happen, but certainly there&#039;s going to be labor cost to remove the walls. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Restaurants will also be permitted to use tent enclosures to keep diners warm. In partial tent enclosures, at least 50% of the tent’s side wall surface area must remain open and electrical heaters are allowed. In full tent enclosures, the tent’s side walls may be closed but occupancy limitations will be capped at 25% of capacity, and indoor dining guidelines must be followed; electrical heaters will also be allowed. Enclosed structures, such as plastic domes, will be allowed for individual parties and must have adequate ventilation to allow for air circulation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				With a 25% rule, the enclosed outdoor spaces make sense.<br /><br />They increase the capacity of the restaurant. <br /><br />25% inside. 25% outside. <br /><br />Maybe the addition of both spaces might even equal 100% of the original indoor seating in some cases. <br /><br />

				&nbsp;Bistro Eloise looks to be doing fine in the outdoor seating area each time I go by. The few times we&#039;ve eaten there have been wonderful during the pandemic - food, service and comfort level. I actually think they might have more seating than before with the inclusion of 25% inside.

				^^most places have less seating outside than inside, except of course for the places with corner lots. (Mojito&#039;s for example. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they have more seating space now) What I&#039;m noticing is that so far, the enclosed spaces aren&#039;t operating at 25% capacity. The tables are placed together normally (or rather, with what is probably supposed to be 6 ft. distance. A lot of restaurants aren&#039;t observing the distance requirement either) and folks are packing in to them. <br /><br />I could see going for a full enclosure in peak winter (I&#039;m skeptical heat lamps are going to do the trick in January &amp; February. And in a snowy winter, a fully enclosed outdoor space will keep the snow and sleet out), but right now? Doesn&#039;t seem wise to me.
