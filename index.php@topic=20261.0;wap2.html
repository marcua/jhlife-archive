			<strong>Rembetisa</strong>:
			<br />
			Raymour and Flanigan distressed dark oak table with 4 chairs and a bench. Has a built in extension. It can seat up to 12 people when extended. It&#039;s in really good shape and from a no pet and no smoke home. One area has a small scrape. $75 as long as you can get it off my hands before the end of the month.
