				Hi Dinorah,<br /><br />I&#039;m your neighbor and I spoke to you the other day. I&#039;m glad you posted on JHLIfe. There is no need to defend yourself as to neutering your cat. People usually post to be helpful, not to demean. Sometimes, although we write things that are addressed to one, we are aware we have an audience and speak with the intent of reaching others as well. It can never be said enough times to neuter your cats. You will be saying it too after this experience. <br /><br />Please let us know if you find your cat. You should come out at night when the cats are screaming. It was loud and unsettling last weekend around the back of my building, between 88th and 89th on 35th.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Jeanette

				Have you checked every nook and cranny of your building? Cats are great at hiding- especially when they are scared. When we moved years ago my cat hid in our couch for two days. Perhaps look around when it is quiet and call him and leave some food around to see if it has been eaten. Also you might want to post on Queens lost and found pets on facebook.
