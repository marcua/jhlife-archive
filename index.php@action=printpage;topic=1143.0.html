				Fillmore Hall is a large building with&nbsp; three separate entrances. One on&nbsp; 35th ave between 83rd &amp; 84th and two between 37th and 35th on 83rd and 84th.&nbsp; It is a prewar building with large apartments but no garage.&nbsp; I only knew one person who lived there and she liked it very much but has since moved to California.

				I live in Fillmore Hall and like it very much. It&#039;s a building on its way up, with new fencing going in, new lobby flooring, and new landscaping on the way--these things do seem to take forever go, because of the permit situation in NYC. The maintenance is higher than I like, because there&#039;s a high mortgage on the building, but that&#039;s supposed to be solved by 2010. The board is good; the building staff are terrific.<br />Tonio

				I live in Fillmore Hall, too. Here&#039;s my two-cents.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lovely prewar building undergoing various improvements inside and out. The apartments are spacious; mine has five closets! It is pet friendly and you can sublet your apartment, subject to restrictions. One thing I like is that we always have plenty of hot water and heat (during heating season, of course). The elevators work just fine; the new laundry room is clean and convenient. The super and crew are efficient -- never a problem there. Yes, the maintenance is on the high end, but not out of bounds for the area. We are not a &quot;name&quot; building, so I think you can get a nice apartment in the Fillmore for less than some of the better known buildings in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Barbara

				thanks, barbara.<br /><br />do you know if there are any junior 4 apts in fillmore? i liked the 1 bd apt i saw; it was spacious and clean, but i really want that extra little room for a study/studio without encroaching in on my living room. from what i saw, and what was told to me, the renovations on the exterior (new fencing, new garden) sounds great.

				I don&#039;t think the Fillmore has junior-4&#039;s. But some of the units have a large walk in closet (off the front hall) that could be converted into an office. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Barbara

				Is Fillmore Hall the building getting the new wrought iron fencing that is about 2 1/2 feet high?&nbsp; My friend said that type of fencing is what is required by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.&nbsp; Does anyone know anything about&nbsp; this?&nbsp; Just curious.

				The building you are referring to is Fillmore Hall. It is located on 35th Ave, between 83rd and 84th streets. <br /><br />I have also heard that only short fences are being approved, though I don&#039;t know the reason for this decision.

				Folks, there&#039;s an open house at Fillmore Hall tonight (Tuesday, 8/12/08) from 6-7:30 pm. The realtor is showing a couple of one bedroom apartments (I&#039;ve seen one, has some beautiful original architectural details). <br /><br />Barbara<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen them too - and though they weren&#039;t quite right for us - there was a lot to like about them, and the building! (And the realtor, is great - any questions we had were answered outright - no dodging or half-answers). I&#039;d highly recommend seeing them!

				Fillmore Hall is one of a number of co-ops in the historic district that have had to go head to head&nbsp; with the NYC Landmarks Committee to get permission to remove ugly old chain link fences that were grandfathered in when landmark status was given to the area.&nbsp; After years of trying to get permission to replace the old chainlink fence with a wrought iron fence that is in keeping with the neighborhood and similar in height to the fence being removed, the Filmore (and other bldgs) were left with the sole choice to live with the old fence -- not a consideration-- or go with the Landmark&#039;s ruling that the fence could not be more than 2 feet tall.&nbsp; Several years ago there was a &quot;town meeting&quot; with Landmarks and Helen Sears supporting the co-ops but&nbsp; it was a losing fight all the way. Fillmore is undergoing a great amount of renovation--fence, landscaping, garden, new lobby floor, new laundry room, new elevators and intercom system.&nbsp; The co-op has in recent years replaced the roof, basement windows, converted heating system from oil to gas/oil, and other structural improvements.&nbsp; Apartments are large and very spacious, many with large entry foyers and/or walk-in sized closets that can be used as an additional room.

				Alicebluegown, thanks for the info. on the fence.&nbsp; I really love Fillmore Hall and think it has many beautiful and original architectural details.&nbsp; I find some of the &quot;no name&quot; buildings to be some of the most beautiful and interesting structures in the whole neighborhood.&nbsp;

				Hi folks, I know I am digging up an old topic but I wanted to check-in on Fillmore Hall and how things have been since this thread was last updated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Particularly, building financials and the experience of living there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am looking at a unit being sold by a friend and have some concerns about the high maintenance fees.&nbsp; &nbsp;How are things day-to-day there?

				I live in Fillmore Hall and really like it.&nbsp; The maintenance staff do a great job looking after the place and, while the maintenance is on the high side, the apartments seem roomier than others in the neighborhood.&nbsp; There was a period where lots of improvements on the building were being made, so the lobby and back garden are beautiful.&nbsp; My only complaint is that the front and side gardens are so neglected.&nbsp; Overall, I recommend the building.

				I was walking down 35th Ave. over the weekend and noticed the new landscaping around Filmore Hall. I&#039;m not sure if this has been in place for a while or is newly planted.<br /><br />I think it is a nice, simple, understated design that should fill in beautifully and offer the opportunity to add more plants in the future if desired. It is much nicer than the work done by many of the landscapers in our neighborhood that attempt to fulfill champagne dreams on a beer budget with the end result being the McGardens of Versailles. The camellia bush by the 35th Ave. entrance is a nice touch and should be blooming soon.<br /><br />Great work to all that were involved. This is a huge improvement to your building and our neighborhood!
