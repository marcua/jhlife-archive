					We&#039;ll see how long this stays on the market at this price. Maybe it will be cut, maybe it will sell. $399 seems high to me, but there&#039;s a reason I&#039;m not in a pre-war.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Belvedere&#039;s garden is that it&#039;s really useable. Every time I walk by the Towers and look in, lovely as the garden is I&#039;ll maybe see one guy sitting in it. Maybe I&#039;m not walking by at the right times. But I see people using the patio/gardens at the Belvedere all the time. I live closer to the Belvedere, so there&#039;s that.

					For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m from an area where dinner and supper are used. Mostly, it&#039;s interchangeable. Dinner was more of a Sunday thing. You had a dinner at lunch time on Sunday. I think it was an after church thing. Families would have a big meal after church - pot roast, potatoes, roasted veggies -- the type of thing you could put in the oven before church and have a big meal at noon after services, sunday school, etc. That meal was called dinner. Every other time dinner/supper could be used interchangeably. <br /><br />Will all your front-of-house staff be bilingual?

					^I kind of think if parents have young kids, they aren&#039;t going to mind going up two flights of stairs. Young kids who need supervision in the bathroom usually have younger parents. My gut feeling is if when you go to sell the house its in good condition, a walk in shower on the second floor isn&#039;t going to be a deal breaker for families with small kids. (And frankly, if they can afford a three story single family home, I doubt the the cost of putting a tub back in if it really bothers them is going to be a deterent. Plus, it&#039;s a 3.5 bathroom house, so even a bathroom remodel isn&#039;t going to be the kind of hassle a remodel is when you only have one bathroom.)

					The only thing I&#039;d add for kids/1 bedrooms is to think about how many couples you know who started out in a one bedroom, stayed in a one-bedroom when baby #1 came along, and only really started to think about a bigger place when baby #1 got big enough to need more space or baby #2 came along. (And I&#039;ve also known some NYC natives who grew up in a one bedroom apartment)<br /><br />But if you plan on staying awhile and don&#039;t see yourself selling in a couple of years go for it. I&#039;m not a bath person either, but I&#039;ve never been bothered enough by stepping in to a tub to want to pay to replace a tub. l

					Did the rules at the Warwick change recently to allow cats? We were told when we inquired about an open house by appointment, that no pets were allowed. Too late for us since we bought elsewhere, but it may not be too late for someone we know with two cats who may be looking in the area soon.<br /><br />(And seriously, what&#039;s with listing agents not including that info in MLS? It&#039;s so annoying when you want a building that allows pets to have zero information about pets on MLSLI or Realtor. Yes or no, just let prospective buyers know.)

					I got a chuckle at what some listing agents tried to pass as an &quot;eat in kitchen&quot; when I was looking. Usually it would be a galley kitchen with appliances and counter on one wall, and the other wall left empty and a tiny table and stool good for a small child pushed against the wall.<br /><br />Studios are tricky. Who is going to live in a studio? A two income couple? Not in Queens. I knew couples who bought studios in Manhattan, but they did so with an eye to rennovating, living in it (uncomfortably) for a year, and then renting it out. These were couples looking to invest in real estate. Obviously, you need a building that allows owners to sublet. An awful lot don&#039;t allow that in JH. <br /><br />What always seemed tricky to me about studios I think they appeal to singles. But, if you&#039;re younger than say 40, aren&#039;t people still holding out hope they might couple up? So buying a studio in an 100% owner occupied building seems like a bad move if you hope to have a reason for some flexibility in the near future. For most young singletons (early-mid 20s) the savings needed is an issue, and I think people who have parents that will bankroll their first home purchase probably aren&#039;t looking to live in Queens. I can see a studio working for an older person looking to downsize after a partner&#039;s death - get the equity in your current place, get in to something smaller and reduce your monthly housing costs.

					Hi everyone. I&#039;m selling this wooden desk. Two shelves - top holds mass market paperbacks, bottom holds trade paperbacks easily. The desk is big enough for a laptop, mousepad, small lamp and a pencil holder. Drawer is decent sized (not a keyboard tray). This is a sturdier design than the wall bookshelves/desks you see since the second support doesn&#039;t come from leaning it against the wall.<br /><br />It&#039;s gently used, meaning it&#039;s in good shape but not in pristine condition. The finish has worn off a bit on one spot where I must have rested my hand a lot. This would be a good buy for someone&#039;s college bound kid living off campus for the first time and with no real furniture. Or for anyone looking to furnish a space in Jackson Heights on a budget.<br /><br />$65 or best offer. Send me an email to arrange a time to come see it/take it.<br /><br />

I think part of it is that they over-expanded too quickly. In Manhattan they feel almost as ubiquitous as Duane Reade or Starbucks (yes, hyperbole, but dang they are everywhere). I&#039;d love a NYSC to come in to the neighborhood - JH residents would flock to a gym that offers classes, towel service, etc. I went to the one in Sunnyside - which actually isn&#039;t the most convenient location for that neighborhood - and it was always decently full. But as mentioned, I&#039;ve been told commercial space rent isn&#039;t much different than Manhattan rents. What gives? That&#039;s just nuts.

					When you look at what&#039;s on the market, and what has recently sold, $300K might be the target for an 800+ square foot pre-war building, with a top-notch renovation using high end materials and finishes, and maybe a full or part-time doorman. Keep in mind some of those comps are condos - which always cost more than a coop. I just hope the people who paid that amount bought in to a well-run coop. It would be a shame to pay such a premium if the building&#039;s financials weren&#039;t in good order.<br /><br />For the rest of the housing stock, which includes post-war buildings, apartments &lt;800 square feet, $300+K isn&#039;t here yet. Keep in mind how the facts presented by an interested party -- like someone who makes a living in real estate -- can be presented while ignoring the many one bedrooms that have sold in the last couple of months for less than $190K, some even as low as in the $120-130K range.
