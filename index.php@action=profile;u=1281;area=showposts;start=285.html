Are you confusing 35th Ave with 34th Ave?&nbsp; Travers Park does not have a corner on 35th Ave.&nbsp; They might have decided that 34th Ave doesn&#039;t need a pedestrian interval device due to the mall in the middle of the street.<br /><br />35th Ave would certainly benefit from this device, as there is a constant conflict between the pedestrians crossing North/South and the turning traffic.&nbsp; A few extra seconds for the pedestrians might lead to safer passage for all, as long as the time allotted for cars going North/South isn&#039;t reduced to accomplish this.

					You are talking about internet cost, but most of your cost is from your television service. I&#039;m not sure what you mean by two hookups, but let&#039;s go over what you need and how much it costs. The fastest internet available shouldn&#039;t run you more than $100 per month. Once you have high speed internet, you don&#039;t need cable TV. Local channels are available over the air for free. You can add premium channels for about $15 per month each. If you like all those other cable channels, you can add Sling TV or DirectTV Now or one of the other services for $20 to $50. Unfortunately, if you have to watch local sports, you&#039;re probably stuck with cable, but out of town sports packages can also be added on. Buy your own cable modem and wifi router and you&#039;ll save on equipment rental fees as well. For phone service you can buy an Ooma Telo and get the same service your cable company charges $30 a month for $4 a month. There&#039;s an article on Cable Cutter Newsabout saving $2000 a year. Also, even if you don&#039;t drop your current provider, talking to them about cutting some of your services will probably lead to a reduction in your current bill. If your building offers RCN, you an get gigabyte internet for about $50 a month. Good luck and don&#039;t be afraid to try to change things up.

					To answer your first post, I have seen enforcement on both Roosevelt Ave - 75th Street and 37th Ave intersections.&nbsp; This usually involves giving tickets for failure to yield and registration/inspection violations.<br />To answer your second post, if you raise an issue about car safety, you cannot ignore pedestrian, bicycle and illegal delivery vehicle issues.&nbsp; These are all interrelated.<br />Traffic is ruled by laws, but it is the observance of the laws that determine whether they are effective.&nbsp; Too many drivers, walkers and bicyclists act as if the laws do not apply to them.&nbsp; Each person that flouts the law renders the social contract underlying the law null and void.<br />When the don&#039;t walk is flashing, don&#039;t cross the street.&nbsp; Allow cars to turn.<br />When there is a pedestrian in your lane, wait for the pedestrian to complete their passage before continuing.<br />If you are riding one of these electric bikes or scooters, get rid of it, get a legal scooter or motorcycle or bicycle, and stop for red lights and yield to pedestrians.<br />The DOT recently installed a delay between car green lights on 37th Avenue and other areas. This makes it much safer for people to cross.&nbsp; However, rather than adding the 7 seconds to the red light green light process, they deducted the 7 seconds from the amount of time drivers have to pass through the light legally.&nbsp; This makes it more likely that frustrated drivers will go through an amber light (or even a red light) and puts different pedestrians at risk.<br />Drivers, get a bluetooth already.&nbsp; What&#039;s wrong with you? Put your phone away.<br />Pedestrians, stop texting long enough to look where you&#039;re going, especially when in an intersection.<br />Finally, stop pushing your infant&#039;s stroller off the curb to wait for the light to change or for traffic to clear.&nbsp; Is the extra second you gain by this stupid practice really worth risking your child&#039;s life?

The scoop law, even though it&#039;s not really enforced, has gone a long way toward improving our quality of life in the neighborhood. It used to look like a public toilet on the sidewalks. <br />We&#039;ve still got a ways to go. To me, not picking up after your dog means you&#039;re not qualified to be a dog owner. Is the dog supposed to pick up after itself? <br />However, we need more places for dog walkers to dispose of the waste. No one seems to bring the waste back to their home to flush. Disposing of the bags in public waste baskets only adds to the unique aroma of the commercial district. Some of the co-ops used to have plastic garbage bags out for dog walkers to&nbsp; use, but I don&#039;t see them so much these days.<br />Unfortunately, the homeless problem in our neighborhood also means that some of what you see in the morning is not to be blamed on dogs.<br />But still much better than back in the day.

					The nerve of these developers putting parking spaces in Jackson Heights when there is an abundance of parking. Oh wait, every spot in JH is taken by off duty cabs and Ubers! And by transit rich you mean the morgue that is the E train in the AM and all the busses bypassing the elderly and handicapped so they have to wait forever until one actually stops. The filthy, overcrowded public transportation system is nothing to crow about. Give me more parking spots any day.

					Never heard of this place until last night. Driving down 37th Ave. and see a sign for Cajun food in Jackson Heights! How could this have opened without my notice? Had no idea what to expect. No, folks, an Oceanic Boil is not some kind of skin affliction. It is a delightful little addition to the JH culinary mix. In case you haven&#039;t had a New Orleans style seafood boil, it&#039;s sort of the seafood equivalent of a chopped salad. The server puts your choice of boiled seafood into a plastic bag in a large wooden salad bowl with potatoes and a half ear of corn and your choice of sauce and shakes it up until everything is imbued with the sauce. We had the 1 lb of mussels and the 1 lb of shrimp with the spicy garlic butter and Bay seasoning (the traditional New Orleans seafood spice mix) and it was delicious. You&#039;ll have to work for your supper, as the shrimp are served with the shell and head still on. The waitress will offer gloves, and if you are digging into the shrimp or crawfish, you&#039;ll appreciate them. <br />Most of the main courses are boiled, most of the appetizers are fried. We spilt the Cajun Seafood Mac &#039;n&#039; cheese appetizer and it was plenty for both of us and very tasty. Well worth a visit, and I wish someone had mentioned this place recently, so I hope this bump helps someone else looking for something different. Oh, the bill came to about $40 before tax and tip. Two $13 entrees, an appetizer, one glass of wine.

					I think you set up this poll incorrectly. Both options say the same thing.&nbsp; A good poll lists a variety of choices.&nbsp; The immigration issue is not a simple Yes/No issue.&nbsp; What should our nation&#039;s policy be on legal immigration?&nbsp; Should America set up immigration laws to only allow white Europeans into the country, like previous administrations have done?&nbsp; Should America allow only talented technical people into the country rather than re-train existing unemployed people to do the new technical jobs? What should America do about the current crop of immigrants in the country illegally, many of whom are paying taxes and not taking benefits (which require a valid social security number, by the way)?<br /><br />We are all immigrants or descendants of immigrants.&nbsp; Many of our ancestors relied on charitable handouts to get started on their way to the American dream.&nbsp; Most of our ancestors would not have been permitted into the country under the proposed immigration law changes.&nbsp; Yet these are the people who made this country great, not the rich landed aristocracy that locks their capital away in passive investments and collects dividends earned from over-charging the poor for basic rights like clean air and water, housing, and medical treatment. So when you figure out how to enter a poll correctly, mark my choice to let the American dream live on in our immigrant sisters and brothers.

					There is already a thread on cable companies in a different section,&nbsp; so review that thread before switching. You should be able to get good enough Internet from your cell phone provider to view your course work.&nbsp; You might have to upgrade your service to an unlimited plan,&nbsp; but if you get rid of your cable or Fios Internet, the extra expense would be offset. You may need to pay extra for tethering or Hotspot access if you have to use a laptop,&nbsp; but you could also just buy a 4G USB modem for your laptop instead.&nbsp; Something to consider, anyway.

					Pedestrians are their own worst enemies in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Too many stand in the street while the light is against them,&nbsp; jaywalking, start crossing while the &quot;Don&#039;t Walk&quot;&nbsp; is flashing,&nbsp; and most egregiously, distracted by their phones.&nbsp; While pedestrians always have the right of way,&nbsp; even when running out between parked cars,&nbsp; cars have to be able to turn while the signal is green. <br />The solution is to move crosswalks to the middle of the block,&nbsp; rather than on the corners.&nbsp; Barricades or fences prevent pedestrians from crossing at the corner.&nbsp; This way cars don&#039;t have to compete with pedestrians to make turns before the light turns red again. <br />This is used on 6th and 5th Avenues during the holiday seasons and works very well to allow cars and crossing pedestrians to co-exist. Until the knuckleheads figure out they can jump over the corner pedestrian barriers to avoid being civil.
