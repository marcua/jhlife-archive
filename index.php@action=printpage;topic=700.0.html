				Five Guys in College Point.&nbsp; Fresh everything.&nbsp; While they&#039;re cooking you can eat, all you want,&nbsp; peanuts in the shell.&nbsp; The fries are served in a brown paper bag.&nbsp; They have malt vinegar if that&#039;s your thing.&nbsp; Lots of free toppings to choose from.<br />I don&#039;t think anything like these burgers and fries are in JHs.&nbsp; Really good artery clogging meal.<br /><br />

				Donovan&#039;s is not as tasty especially the fries.&nbsp; Donovan&#039;s taste like most frozen french fries.&nbsp; Even Jackson Hole, which has a much bigger size burger, isn&#039;t as good.&nbsp; Sometimes having a burger be too big just doesn&#039;t taste as good.&nbsp; I remember when CUP in Astoria had the largest burgers we&#039;d even seen.&nbsp; People used to complain because you couldn&#039;t eat it without using a knife and fork and it was hard to cook right without over or under cooking it cuz of it&#039;s size.<br /><br />Nope I&#039;m totally into five guys. ha.

				I love Donovan&#039;s burgers <strong>and</strong> their fries.&nbsp; I have never been to five guys but I definitely want to try it.&nbsp; Legend&#039;s on 35th Avenue also has really good burgers but their fries are only average.&nbsp; I love Jackson Hole for the great service and breakfast but I agree their hamburgers are good but not great.&nbsp; Most of the time they fall apart and I end up using a knife and fork

				So check this out, today I had lunch at Jackson Hole.&nbsp; Purely for science.&nbsp; I rarely eat burgers never mind twice in one week.<br /><br />I forgot how retro and kitschy Jackson Hole is inside... sweet.&nbsp; But there is no comparison.&nbsp; Yes, the burgers are fresh (not patties) there, too but they&#039;re too damn fat.&nbsp; And the fries: FROZEN.&nbsp; And they taste frozen - they&#039;re dry inside . Now they have a huge, fun menu so I still think Jackson Hole is a fun place. Plus they serve breakfast all day which I love.<br /><br />But I got to say - best burger and fries around - especially for a chain: the winner is Five Guys.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never tried one, but I hear that Shake Shack burgers are pretty good.&nbsp; I remember hearing a rumor last year about Danny Meyer possibly opening a new location at Citifield, the new Mets Stadium.&nbsp; If that does happen, I wonder if it will only be open to those attending games.

				About once per summer someone convinces me to go to the Shake Shack.&nbsp; The burgers are ok there, but definitely not as good as Donovan&#039;s in Woodside or Molly&#039;s on 3rd Ave and 22nd St in the city or even the Corner Bistro in the Village.&nbsp; The place just seems way over-hyped to me.&nbsp; And the wait is outrageous.&nbsp; Between waiting in line and waiting for my order, I always wait at least an hour at Shake Shack to get my food.&nbsp; Shake Shack kind of reminds me of the In N Out Burger they have out west, only at 3 times the cost and 10 times the wait, and without the cool secret menu.

				The burgers at Jackson Hole are cooked on a grill with a small metal cup covering them creating somewhat of steam effect.&nbsp; I suppose they cook them that way because they&#039;re so thick to begin with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a few of the burgers, and have also ended up having to use a knife and fork.&nbsp; In my opinion, that eliminates the fun of eating a burger.&nbsp; By the way, no grill marks or seared flavor either.&nbsp; I enjoy the Jackson Hole breakfasts, but the lines can get quite long, especially on weekend mornings.<br /><br />Guilty pleasure:&nbsp; White Castle burgers. :embarassed:&nbsp; In my defense, I haven&#039;t had one in a while.

				The best burger I&#039;ve had in Jackson heights came from Novo. It&#039;s not on their menu anymore, but it was amazing.<br />I had it about 2 or 3 months ago, I think. If you ask for it, they&#039;ll make it for you. It had some mixed herbs in it and was very tasty.<br />It wasn&#039;t overly piled on with toppings either.<br /><br />But the best burgers in New York in my opinion are at New York Burger Company.<br />The one I frequent is on 6th Avenue and 21st street in Chelsea.<br />I always get the Seattle burger. Sometimes the fries can be soggy, though.

I don&#039;t know.

				The fries at NY Burger are cut fresh with every order, so I&#039;m not exactly sure the reason they come out soggy somtimes (and, it&#039;s only been once or twice). All I know is that when I eat the burgers there, I don&#039;t feel guilty (like I would at McD&#039;s...) all the toppings are perfectly prepared and it&#039;s not greasy at all. It all tastes very fresh.<br /><br />But anyway, you should try Novo&#039;s burger, since it&#039;s here and it&#039;s good.

				I love Five Guys!! It&#039;s a small chain from DC/Virginia which was where I got exposed to the wonder of <strong>free unlimited toppings</strong> on burgers. I was so excited when it moved here. To be fair I&#039;ve never been to the one at College Point but they have opened at least two locations in Manhattan, one just 2 blocks away from the E line at Lex/53rd. The cajun fries are excellent too. Did I mention free toppings? Oh, did I also mention free peanuts while you wait?!

				If you want a good Cuban sandwich, go to El Sitio on 69th and Rosie. Their vaca frita ( I don&#039;t know if the spelling is correct on that. I&#039;m not spanish. ) is awesome too. I&#039;ve been eating there for 20 years.

				Sorry, Chuckster.<br /><br />Xtasis is a great place to have in the neighborhood.&nbsp; My 5-year-old loves it, and it&#039;s a quirky and fun alternative to the corporate fast food joints.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not worth a special trip.<br /><br />One of their fun quirks is that you can get just about anything (burgers, hot dogs, arepa sandwiches) either &quot;Cuban&quot; style (which involves minced garlic, like a cubano) or &quot;Hawaiian&quot; style (which involves crushed pineapple).&nbsp; No matter what you get, and whether you like it or not, finishing off your meal with a cholados will ensure that you leave happy!

Not as good as their steaks, of course, but mighty tasty. One of my favorite thing about Uncle Jack&#039;s is the service. Not usually one of my criteria for a good meal, but so exceptional that it is hard not to notice. At one outing there, one of my dinner companions grimaced, and before we had a chance to ask him what was wrong, the maÃ®tre d&#039; was at the table finding out if everything was okay. Way to go Uncle Jack!

				Mo coworker and I went after work and I&#039;m glad I got the small (single patty) cheeseburger and we split a small fries.&nbsp; The burger was as good as any well done patty could be made.&nbsp; I still would rather have a thick medium rare burger from Donovan&#039;s though.&nbsp; The fries were another story.&nbsp; They were out of this world.&nbsp; One small order feeds two.&nbsp; It reminded me of when I was a kid and I got fries for lunch in a fish store near my grammer school.&nbsp; They were also in a brown paper bag and you could see the grease coming through the bag.&nbsp; I did have two concerns.&nbsp; The first is that they should have a Cardiologist on duty.&nbsp; The second is that I&nbsp; saw many people here who were 100lbs overweight.&nbsp; The portion sizes of&nbsp; the fries must be a total day&#039;s calories and you should not go here more than a few days a year.

				So Buddy and I had a very informal meet-up this afternoon and since it was lunchtime, we decided to go to Five Guys in College Point.&nbsp; This was my first time there, and it certainly won&#039;t be the last!&nbsp; O.K., so I need to pack on 5 more lbs....yeah right. :-\&nbsp; Anyway, I ordered the single burger topped with fried onions, lettuce and ketchup.&nbsp; It was absolutely delicious!&nbsp; All burgers are cooked well done, nonetheless, my burger was juicy and flavorful.&nbsp; No extra seasonings whatsoever, just the natural flavor of the meat in addition to the added toppings.&nbsp; We also shared an order of the fries which is huge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to today&#039;s visit, I had a different idea of what Five Guys would be like.&nbsp; I pictured it somewhat more of a diner type setting.&nbsp; It&#039;s very casual...you order at the counter, stuff yourself with peanuts and wait for your number to be called.&nbsp; Definitely go!<br /><br />And, as if we hadn&#039;t had enough to eat, we also decided to check out the new place on 31st Avenue in Woodside, called Patio.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post about it on another thread.

				Joe&#039;s is very easy to get to by the 7 train. Isn&#039;t the entrance to Joe&#039;s about 20 feet from the exit?<br />Also, there is a new parking garage at 38th Avenue and 138th Street (Queens Crossing).<br /><br />Though, I tend to disagree. Joe&#039;s doesn&#039;t look all that great to me. But I also think that if I&#039;m going to Flushing, I wouldn&#039;t order a burger, so maybe I should try it anyway.

				The buns look like standard white bread McDonalds buns, not like the &quot;toasted brioche style bun&quot; like they have at New York Burger Company (my favorite) http://www.newyorkburgerco.com/html/menu.html<br /><br />It also looks like the place might be a rip-off of Hardees (http://www.hardees.com/home). I don&#039;t know if they have Hardees here in New York, but they had them in the MidWest 20 years ago and the burgers pale in comparison with NY Burger Co.<br /><br />But maybe I&#039;ll try them next time I&#039;m in Flushing. Last time we were there we went to the really un-tasty Chinese restaurant in Queens Crossing. Ick.

				O.K.&nbsp; I just noticed that the name of the restaurant omits the &quot;s&quot;, so it&#039;s not cheeseburger, but cheeburger.&nbsp; Anyone remember the Greek diner skit from Saturday Night Live with John Belushi?&nbsp; That was hysterical!&nbsp; Ahem, back to the topic at hand now.&nbsp; Cheeburger Cheeburger seems to have a much more varied menu than Five Guys.&nbsp; A typical meal at Cheeburger would be a burger, fries or onion rings and a shake.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; I wonder how many calories would be in a meal like that.

So much so, that I&#039;ve given them 5 or 6 chances.&nbsp; I went again the other day and yet again, the burger was dry and way overcooked.&nbsp; I usually ask for medium, but the last two times I asked for very rare and specifically asked that it not be well done.&nbsp; No luck - it was well done.&nbsp; <br /><br />But it&#039;s still one of my favorite places to grab a beer wtih friends - the bartenders are really friendly.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just have to lower my expectations when it comes to the food...
