				The barracks-like buildings in the Sports Authority parking lot are not being used as much now that we have vaccines and other testing sites. Don&#039;t know how much they would have to be retrofitted but before the city tears them down I would like them to consider making them into housing either temporary or permanent for the homeless. They look at least as big as tiny houses and other construction I&#039;ve seen for the homeless. Any idea who I can take this idea to?

Isn&#039;t that site part of the site where the new school is going to go? In any case, it must be quite valuable real estate since it&#039;s well located by the train.

				They would have to be moved, since this site has been earmarked for construction of a new High School. I suspect these trailers were rented and not purchased, but your suggestion is a good one.

				&nbsp;The suggestion is a great one on the use of trailers but the site would have to be somewhere else. They are busy taking down the former Sports Authority building right on the other side of the site. There are industrial areas not far away though and I wonder if they could use part of the Sunnyside train yards redevelopment program, at least temporarily, because that looks to be many years from completion as full on housing.
