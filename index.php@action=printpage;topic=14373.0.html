				“Elliman Report: Manhattan, Brooklyn &amp; Queens Rentals” <br /><br />We have just released the “Elliman Report: Manhattan, Brooklyn &amp; Queens Rentals” for <strong><span class="bbc_u">March 2016</span></strong>, the leading resource on the state of the rental market. Our Brooklyn rental report coverage area was recently expanded to include the entire borough. As always, our market reports are produced in conjunction with Miller Samuel to provide you and your clients with the most comprehensive and neutral market insight available.<br />&nbsp;<br />Overall Manhattan rents softened for the first time in two years. Weaker conditions were seenacross apartment sizes as vacancy rates and landlord concessions were than higher than last year’s levels.<br />&nbsp;<br />In contrast, Brooklyn rents moved higher this month after showing weakness in the fall. Like the other boroughs, luxury rents remained the weakest segment of the marketwhile rents for smaller apartments remained strong.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Queens rental market continued to see new units enter the market, accounting for about a quarter of activity. Rental prices slipped with the weaker trends found in the luxury market.<br />&nbsp;<br />At Douglas Elliman, we are constantly looking for ways to provide our clients with better information, empowering them to make more informed decisions.
