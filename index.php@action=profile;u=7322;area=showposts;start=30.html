					It is a great place. The owner has a real vision in mind of what he wants the place to be, but let&#039;s respect the place enough to offer constructive criticism so that it can only improve on itself: the cocktails are sub-par. This is true for most of the places in Jackson Heights, with the exception of Amaru on northern blvd. Jackson heights is more of a bottled beer drinking town, so it is understandable. But it would be nice to be able to order a cocktail other than rum and coke and have it taste like it&#039;s supposed. <br /><br />

					There is a guy who frequently plays trumpet by the Foodtown on 76th and 37th ave.<br />An older gentleman that has taken to playing his electric acoustic guitar on the bench on 82nd street (in front of the GNC) or on the corner of 82nd and 37th ave. <br />There is also a guy who plays some spanish ballad standards in the fish and chips place under the 7 train right off of the 82nd on roosevelt.<br /><br />It really is tragic that live music in the street isn&#039;t more present in Jackson Heights considering more than half of the neighborhood is Hispanic. Improvised jamming on the street is a standard in Latin America. Maybe it is because spanish towns are always built with a central plaza that is flanked on all sides by staple institutions (bank, church, post office). The plaza de armas is where people of all ages go to sit on benches or stroll or run errands. Because of that it is the ideal place for street performers and musicians. It is also well patrolled so you feel safe. <br /><br />The 82nd development office had mentioned wanting to renovate the the triangle on Baxter avenue (not Manuel de Dios triangle). I&#039;d mentioned the idea of emulating the plaza de armas on a smaller scale with the goal of luring musicians.&nbsp;

					What street and ave are they on? I find this pretty amusing. I would like to look at these characters. Talk that tough should be backed up by some serious looking people, and tough is never a vibe I get walking through 74 or 73rd street.

					Life long resident of 34 years. I stay away from the &quot;hipster&quot; term because I find it repulsive. The Lower East Side (where I spent most of my teenage and late 20&#039;s) was always interesting and creative, but, no, not hipsterish until around a decade ago...which kind of coincides with the after-birth of what is Williamsburg. Go figure. <br /><br />All I&#039;m trying to say is that creative and artistic are not the same as Hipster, neither is Bohemian for that matter. I&#039;ll never rally behind or associate anything redeemable with &quot;Hipster.&quot;<br /><br />What I will say is that I have always wished there were a bar with a more punk/hardcore/ska/reggae or bohemian flavor to it. Christ! We&#039;re the borough that produced the Ramones! And more immediately, the neighborhood that gave the world Johnny Thunders of the New York Dolls (like the Ramones, from Forest Hills) - not to mention Reagan Youth and Kraut and Murphy&#039;s Law.<br /><br />People don&#039;t realize it, but when they talk about the sound of new york rock, they&#039;re referring to bands that came out of Queens!!!<br /><br />I used to go consistently to Terraza a few years back. i found the vibe very cliquish. I&#039;m of hispanic descent but there is a cultural difference when you&#039;re born and raised here (yet spanish speaking) than when you are born and raised in south America and you&#039;re not at your most comfortable speaking English. <br /><br />To that end I would like to open a bar with the&nbsp; vibe that would naturally result from having a jukebox (yes, a real jukebox matters because it tells you who frequents the place) of standard punk/roots rock/ska/reggae (and by standards I include latin american rock/punk/ska). It would also be great to have a place to watch a futbol (soccer) game with the sound ON for the english and the spanish leagues that is also capable of making a decent cocktail (terraza, you&#039;re terrible!!!)<br /><br />This wouldn&#039;t be a place opened for &quot;hipsters&quot; or as a refuge for the recent arrival of non-hispanic transplants, but I&#039;ll bet money that&#039;s what it would become, and I see nothing wrong with that. It&#039;s always good to have an alternative to the mainstay. It&#039;s the bar I wish I would&#039;ve had when I was a kid, before Giuliani made it impossible for teenagers to sneak into bars.

					I&#039;m a life long resident of Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m also of the mind that dangerous means gangs, gunfire, robberies, junkies. Jackson heights is at worst seedy. And this absolutley should be addressed, but generally speaking it&#039;s not a dangerous neighborhood. In fact, I&#039;m still somewhat shocked that it isn&#039;t a more dangerous neighborhood, considering the drug and prostitution trades that flourish here. Add to that the homosexual and transgender - transgender prostitution demographic, and you&#039;ll understand why it&#039;s more seedy (read: not very wholesome or safe, but not dangerous if you&#039;re just walking through).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Compare the statistics to Corona, you&#039;ll see what I mean. Also as a journalism major you really should google &quot;Manuel De dios Unanue&quot; as his life and death tie in to the neighborhood, and few people know about him.

					Hey,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m on the 6th floor in an apartment that&#039;s the nearest one to the elevator. There is a strange smell that permeates the immediate entrance/alcove area of the apartment at least once a day (maybe fewer). I can&#039;t say what it is exactly. It&#039;s not a bad smell, but there is nothing pleasant about it either. It sometimes smells like food when it&#039;s being cooked, but not exactly. The wierdest thing is that i can&#039;t locate the source. I&#039;ve gotten on my hands and knees and sniffed around the floor molding, the walls, the entrance closet, and the smell always seems strongest in free standing spot of the entrance/alcove area. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one thing that does stick out is that i was told that behind the semi-circular alcove and behind the elevator there is a chimney where steam comes out. That seems like the obvious answer, but again the smell isn&#039;t any stronger by the wall that is closest to this chimney. And this has been an issue during both winter and summer. Any suggestions? Any recommendations for scenting the air with something that is not heavily perfumed?<br /><br />thanks.<br />&nbsp;

And please be aware of puritanical strains of thought that veer into down right fanaticism. Despite advertising and media at the end of the day we are all human beings responsible for our own actions. We&#039;re free to think anything we want about any woman who walks down the street, and yes being dressed provocatively DOES make that alot easier for men, but nothing allows anyone to make anyone else feel uncomfortable and unsafe through conversation or gestures.<br /><br />Just report this to the police. The police will go and question the vendor. Whether he did or didn&#039;t harrass this woman, guaranteed he will be more careful how he speaks to his female clientale lest he be visited again by another police officer. <br /><br />These guys aren&#039;t brazen criminals. They&#039;re petty low-lifes trying to get their kicks in whatever way they can. Shine a light in their face and they&#039;ll retreat like any roach. Stay quiet and they&#039;ll keep doing it.<br /><br /><br />

					oh, thank god. i feel like i&#039;ve just found a support group for people who despise/dread water bugs.<br /><br />What buildings are you guys in (so i know to never purchase an apartment in them)?<br />I&#039;m at the colonial court on 76th street. The building itself is hot and humid. I mean seriously tropical. My apartment is at least 10 degrees hotter than outside. This has to contribute to these suckers thriving like they do.<br /><br />But this is the most disturbing part. I&#039;ve lived on the other side of roosevelt avenue, y&#039;know the less cleanly, stinky part of the nieghborhood and for all the little roaches that you&#039;d come across, I hardly ever came across waterbugs!!!!<br />I bought into Jackson Heights proper thinking i&#039;m moving up in the barrio, only to find WATERBUGGS!?

					I think it may also be fair to question the schedule of the sanitation department. I&#039;ve made the mistake in the past of attributing the lack of cleanliness to the residents of the effected area, but to follow that reasoning to its full conclusion is to believe that one group of people produce &quot;more&quot; trash than another, which i think is generally absurd. <br /><br />It&#039;s not unheard of that certain areas get better, and more punctual, service than others. Since immigrant neighborhoods are way less vocal and in touch or trusting of their local politicians, they are the first ones neglected by sanitation and police departments. <br /><br />Less cops, fewer trash cans, fewer trash pick-ups...what do you think is going to happen?<br />
