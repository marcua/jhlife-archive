				&nbsp;Please be careful today - and everyday- walking on 34th Ave. The last few days have been very busy with vehicles on 34th Ave and they may not be aware of the Open Street, especially if they are not local drivers and the barriers are off to the side.<br />

				Wait... they plowed the &quot;open street&quot;? So it&#039;s to be treated like a regular thoroughfare for snow removal using my tax dollars, but still supposed to be off-limits to traffic? Why not leave it covered in snow so people can use it to cross-country ski, sled and toboggan? If only we could be so lucky as to have a water main break -- that way we can have an ice skating rink, too.

				It is only closed during certain hours, and people who live there are still allowed to drive their cars on that street. There are still cars parked there. It&#039;s not a pedestrian mall. I agree with the suggestion to separate walkers and bikers (and scooters) onto separate sides. Being hit by a bike does seem to be a risk there, as bikers don&#039;t always stay in the bike lane, and you can&#039;t hear them coming up behind you.

With miles of new &quot;protected&quot; bike lanes, Citi Bike docking stations, Vision Zero alterations, new &quot;loading zones&quot; and the countless unused outdoor dining sheds, there&#039;s actually fewer and fewer places to find street parking in this city or in Jackson Heights (when I need to use my car which I keep garaged in Woodside). <br /><br />By the way, I am ALL FOR the idea of residential parking permits, but it seems we can&#039;t do that here in NYC despite the desperately needed revenue it would raise for the city.

				<br />My family has really enjoyed the open space along 34th Avenue.&nbsp; It is great to be able to get some exercise and see some friends in a safe, socially distant manner.<br /><br />Will it be back open again tomorrow after the snow?

				Eventually when Zip cars (rent by the hour, parked in neighborhoods) take over. And the prices for that become low enough.&nbsp; Then private car ownership decreases and there won&#039;t be parking problems.<br /><br />After all, most private cars simply take up space being parked, wasting space...for the majority of time. They&#039;re not used.<br /><br />Much how like Citibike has solved a transport problem with bikes.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;ll be generational...younger folks, trained on the Citibike model,&nbsp; will be happy to rent cars like Zip by the hour/day/week and ditch the private car 1970&#039;s era notion.
