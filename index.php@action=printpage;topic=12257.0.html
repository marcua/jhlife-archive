				I know it used to be a Christian Science church back in the &#039;80s....the look of the building seems to point to that being the original use

				I think it&#039;s discussed in that JH history book, that...was it Boudoin? or the JHGC wrote/published.<br /><br />Anyway, my book is put away for now. If you have a copy, the discussion is near the end. I believe the building was never finished, which is what I find interesting about it. It lost its funding mid-construction. It was supposed to be a much larger and elaborate place. <br /><br />If someone looks it up, please post. I could be wrong. thanks.

				It was built by the Christian Scientists. The original portion is the section by the 87th St. corner. The initial plan for that section was a larger and grander edifice that never went beyond the ground level. They later built the 86th St. side as a more modest compromise that is rather tasteful and elegant.
