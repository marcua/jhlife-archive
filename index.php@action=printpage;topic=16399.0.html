				“T’ai Chi means ‘the ultimate.’&nbsp; It means improving, and progressing toward the unlimited; it means the immense existence and the great eternal.”&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; Waysun Liao, Tai Chi Classics <br /><br />About me: I am a physical therapist with a background in several martial arts for more than 20 years.&nbsp; Tai Chi is a martial art and has martial applications after extensive training, but most people practice Tai Chi for health reasons which are well documented.&nbsp; My Tai Chi background is in the standardized Yang 24, 32, and 48 forms.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in offering a Sunday morning Tai Chi class in Travers Park, starting from the basics.&nbsp; All levels welcome.&nbsp; $15 per class, first class free. <br /><br /><br />

				Awesome!&nbsp; The park gets pretty busy with kids playing by 10 a.m. so early morning (8 or 9 a.m.) would be best.&nbsp; In addition, once the weather gets hot it is much nicer practicing earlier in the shaded areas.&nbsp; Let me know what works and we could meet this Sunday for our first class!&nbsp;

				I would love to join this class, and I completely understand the advantages of starting early at the park. Unfortunately, there is very little chance I&#039;d make early morning sessions on Sundays. If you ever find a way to start something later in the day, please keep me posted!

				I am an absolute beginner.&nbsp; I would be interested in a class if it is very early in the morning.&nbsp; Please post the info when you set it up.

				Weather permitting (no heavy rain!), I will be in Travers park warming up around 8:30 a.m. on Sunday.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to lead a formal class at 9 a.m. wherever it is not too crowded.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to my work website to help you find me: http://shift.nyc/team/#matt-leve. Hope to see some of you there!&nbsp;
