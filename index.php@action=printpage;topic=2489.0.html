				A while back I noticed some signs by the cash registers at the Met on 37th Avenue requesting that people sign a petition supporting the sale of wine in supermarkets.&nbsp; Today, I came across an article in The New York Times stating that Gov. Patterson has submitted a proposal along with his budget that would allow any grocery or convenience store with a retail beer license to also apply for a wine license.&nbsp; According to the plan, accompanying licensing fees would bring in needed revenue.&nbsp; One argument against this proposal is that your typical small liquor store would be adversely affected by the competition. Others argue that wine being sold at local markets may attract underage drinking.&nbsp; Proponents of the plan tout the convenience and choices that may become available if this proposal is approved. <br /><br /><strong>Question:&nbsp; Would you buy wine at your local supermarket?</strong><br /><br />The New York Times -- Chardonnay in Aisle 3?

				Yes!&nbsp; Costco is the leading seller of fine wine in this country, but not in New York. Moreover, under the current law, not only does Trader Joe&#039;s have to have a separate store for wine, but they are allowed only a single license for a single store in the entire State.&nbsp; Thus, in Queens they can&#039;t even have an attached wine store.&nbsp; <br /><br />With respect to the under age drinking argument, young people generally don&#039;t run down to 78th Street Park on a Summer night and crack open a fine Bordeaux.&nbsp; I know I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; We drank beer which, ironically, is already available at supermarkets.&nbsp; If we trust supermarkets not to sell beer to young people, we can trust them with wine.<br /><br />I feel bad for the local liquor stores, but I am always disappointed by their selection and prices. I find myself going into Manhattan or Grand Wines in Astoria to find the stuff I want at a reasonable price.&nbsp;

				I have two problems with this proposal, and neither has anything to do with underage drinking. <br /><br />1. I&#039;m not entirely convinced that wine sold in NYC supermarkets would offer better prices than liquor stores. I&#039;m sure that high liquor taxes in NYS and the overhead costs associated with running the relatively small supermarkets in the city would <span class="bbc_u">not</span> make the price of a bottle of wine as cheap as what I&#039;ve seen in places like Florida and California where the supermarkets are the size of aircraft hangars.<br /><br />2. Given the limited shelf space available in most NYC supermarkets, devoting an aisle or even half and aisle to wine means cutting the selection of groceries and other goods available for sale elsewhere in the store. If that&#039;s the case, I&#039;d rather give up the convenience and stop in at the wine shop <span class="bbc_u">after</span> I do my grocery shopping.

				I&#039;m going to add to the dissent- I would never buy wine in a supermarket because I like the expertise that&#039;s offered in the liquor store.&nbsp; I don&#039;t drink that much wine, so I don&#039;t usually have a good sense of what I should be getting to pair with a meal, the differences between different white wines, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m even willing to pay more per bottle for that service.

				Personally I can&#039;t see buying wine sold at any of the grocery stores in the neighborhood, but then again I have a hard time buying wine at any of the liquor stores in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Part of the issue is with storage and climate control, but the other part is product knowledge (as noted by Judibean.)&nbsp; Picking a wine is not like choosing between Fruit Loops and Cheerios.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the law is changed it should be done fairly:<br />Wine and liquor stores to should be allowed to sell more than wine and booze.&nbsp; Currently they are not even allowed to sell beer!<br />Also, restrictions on owners having multiple store locations limit the buying power of the owners.<br /><br />I am actively pursuing a venture opening a new store in JH, selling affordable quality wines, but I am waiting the outcome of this proposed law change.&nbsp; I am hopeful that we will be selling wine &amp; craft beer, along with food items to go with the beverages (IE nice cheeses.)

				I am all for more competition. The mom and pops have something that walmart will never have. let walmart sell the crap.&nbsp; We have at least 4 produce stores in the neighbhorhood - in competition wtih the supermarkets.<br />BTW - there already is a supermarket that sells wines in JH. in very limited quantity, but they do it. I dont know why and I&#039;m not going to divulge because I like the people there. <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to figure out why the law is there in the first place...

				In California urban supermarkets, an entire aisle is often dedicated to wine sales.&nbsp; To my untrained eye, the selection was about comparable to the other products the market offered.&nbsp; If the store offered an ecclectic range of organic and non-organic foods from smaller manufacturers, it was likely to stock smaller breweries and vineyards as well.&nbsp; If the store was all about mass consumer goods, the booze aisle would reflect that.&nbsp; I think that bodes well for what Met and Trade Fair might carry.<br /><br />However, since our stores are so much smaller, I would share StevenGrey&#039;s concern about their selection of food items being reduced as a result.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, any ground they cede would create new market opportunities for other businesses.&nbsp; Maybe a liquor store will go out of business, but a new specialized food store could open in its place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, I don&#039;t drink wine, and my wife and I purchase wine directly from vineyards, not from stores.&nbsp; So feel free to ignore me!<br />

				NO! keep the booze in liquor stores!, consolidation of products and goods leads to homogenization of products line and overall negative impact on the variety of items a community can consume.&nbsp; supermarkets already decide for you what you will eat, lets keep some choice in what we drink<br /><br />

				I would love to buy wine in the grocery store this would save time-- for me anyhow. It doesnt make sense why I can buy beer at the grocery store- heck even rite aid sells beer and cigarettes-I don&#039;t smoke but the drug stores still sell them. We go out of state&nbsp; regularly and always buy wine there in the supermarkets. Its a silly law and when I was a teen I drank beer and liquor NEVER wine

				Can&#039;t find a news article, but NPR reported this morning that the bill to allow wine sales in grocery stores has been defeated.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about it...a good wine shop will probably not suffer that much because they offer things that little grocery stores in the city never will: expertise, great selection, rare finds, relationships with the owners, etc.&nbsp; Local businesses are great, but not if they survive despite their poor quality solely because the gov&#039;t has granted them a local monopoly.

				The laws regarding sale of alcohol are certainly strange. I used to promote liquor and so I spent some time at various liquor stores and learned that these are laws:<br /><br />-Liquor stores are not allowed to sell beer, only wine and liquor<br />-Liquor stores are not allowed to sell non-alcoholic beverages, which is why the only &quot;mixers&quot; sold there contain at least 1% alcohol.<br />-Liquor stores are not allowed to be open for more than 5 hours on a Sunday.<br />-Alcohol may not be sold before noon on a Sunday.<br /><br />In Albany county, liquor stores were not allowed to be open past 9pm.&nbsp; I believe that law varies by county, as I have seen other counties be as early as 7pm.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about around here.<br /><br />I can see if the current law, stating that wine can only be sold in liquor stores was changed, it would probably cause many liquor stores to shut down.&nbsp; While a lot can be said about appreciating the expertise and service provided at liquor stores, the convenience of the supermarket will outweigh that for many individuals, myself included.&nbsp; That being said, I&#039;m not a big drinker and do not really appreciate the qualities of good wine--it all really pretty much all tastes the same to me.&nbsp; When I make my wine purchases, it&#039;s almost always because I&#039;m visiting someone and bring a bottle with me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if there are enough people who really do appreciate wine and need the additional selection of a liquor stores are around here to support all of the liquor stores if wine were to be sold in the supermarket.

				I certainly don&#039;t disagree that some liquor shops might have closed if the grocery stores sold wine.&nbsp; But note in my comment above that I said &quot;good&quot; wine shops would probably still do well!&nbsp; There are at least five crappy liquor / wine stores within three blocks of my apt, and I wouldn&#039;t care if all of them closed.&nbsp; Would love to see the five replaced with one good one (or even a good selection at a grocery store).<br /><br />The liquor laws are silly all around.

Since I grew up in states where all liquor could be purchased at a supermarket, I never understood why not wine. And the inability for a store to have more than one branch in the state is ludicrous. I love Trader Joe&#039;s wine store, but not lugging home wine from Union Square. And for the brief moment that Whole Foods had a wine store in Columbus circle was great - supermarkets with really great buyers, and brought in some unusual, tasty and inexpensive wines. Not to be too mean to the mom-n-pop liquor stores, but the wine selection is often very lacking - esp. if the focus is really more on the liquor than the wine.&nbsp; And the liquor stores that do have a good wine buyer are punished by not being able to open up a second location.

				I don&#039;t know that supermarkets will necessarily compete with a well-done, personalized-service wine store, like Table Wine is. Since it takes me a good half-hour to walk to table wine and back - when I have guests over I sometimes have to stop at one of the less pleasant liquor stores and just grab a bottle of whatever&#039;s there (Yellowtail has often become a default table wine because of that). &nbsp;Also, as far as hours go, Table Wine is not that easy for me - by the time I get home and take the dog out for a potty break, many neighborhood stores, including Table Wine are closed. (If it closes before 8:30-9, I&#039;m not gonna make it most nights) If I could buy a half-decent bottle of wine at Trade Fair or another supermarket that is open (I don&#039;t know if the 24-hour Indian groceries near me would choose to sell wine) as I pick up something for dinner, I would greatly appreciate it. <br /><br />I think that the &nbsp;supermarkets will take some of the wine sales from liquor stores, but a well run wine store shouldn&#039;t have too much to fear. I know that where my parents live in Virginia, they often buy wine at Whole Foods or Harris Teeter supermarkets, but they also patronize Best Cellars in Arlington, which seems to do just fine despite the availability of wine in local supermarkets. http://www.bestcellars.com/aboutbc/stores_clarendon.cfm (http://www.bestcellars.com/aboutbc/stores_clarendon.cfm) In many ways, Table Wine reminds me of Best Cellars in that there&#039;s a carefully chosen small selection of all-good, not-too-expensive wines - curating and organizing the selection makes all the difference in the world.<br />&nbsp;<br />Table Wine seems to be doing the right thing - having tastings, explaining wines - building a community around its wine store. Plus, once supermarkets can sell wine, can&#039;t wine stores sell crackers, cheeses, and things that are frequently eaten with wine? Wouldn&#039;t it also allow them to sell specialty and crafted beers as well?<br /><br />Here&#039;s another article about another VA-based wine store, The Curious Grape, which also exists quite nicely amongst thousands of supermarkets selling wine. (I point out VA since that&#039;s where I have experience with wine in Grocery Stores coexisting with wine stores...I know California does it too, and specialty wine stores are everywhere there) &nbsp;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011401618.html (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/14/AR2010011401618.html)<br />

				The New York Daily News&#039; Daily Politics section and Business Week also make mention of the Governor&#039;s proposal re: wine sales in grocery stores.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#039;s just that... brief mentions of it being one of various income generating proposals.&nbsp; By the way, legalizing mixed martial arts in the state is also included, but that&#039;s a topic for another thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-X<br /><br />Paterson&#039;s 2010-2011 Budget Proposal - Overview (http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/01/patersons-2010-2011-budget-pro.html)<br /><br />N.Y.â€™s Paterson Proposes Spending Cuts to Bridge Gap (http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-19/n-y-s-paterson-proposes-spending-cuts-to-bridge-gap-update1-.html)<br /><br />

				Marcus, thanks for sharing the article. &nbsp;As someone who is not comfortably familiar with wines, vintages, food pairings, etc., I appreciate whatever help I can get in making a good selection, and the events at The Curious Grape make for good business sense IMHO. &nbsp;I would imagine that this type of service almost guarantees that people in that store&#039;s vicinity will be drinking good wine more often. &nbsp;Out local Table Wine seems to have started off on the right foot.

				I guess the ideal scenario in my mind is to have locations that cater to just wine as well as the larger C-Town types for the quick stuff.&nbsp; Much like you go to your pharmacy when you can, but Duane Reade at 1 a.m. because it&#039;s open?<br /><br />Odds are, the supermarket won&#039;t be handling vintages and stuff the way the expert shops will.<br /><br />

				I for one would love to see wine offered in grocery stores. &nbsp;On a recent trip back home (Al.) I was surprised to see the great selection of wine and craft beer offered at one of their nicer grocery stores. &nbsp;My feeling is that if someone is into vintage, hard to find wines they would not be interested in this type of venue and as far as advice on pairing wine with food and general advice about wine I have to tell you most wine stores I&#039;ve been to are really not as educated about their product in other words many will just give a pat generalization...spicy/fruity/dry. &nbsp;This is where an educated consumer is better off. &nbsp;I am a firm believer is doing your research. &nbsp;I have discovered that my tastes lean toward full- bodied reds with a hint of blackberry/cherry...in other words mostly a syrah, shiraz or cabernet sauvignon. Cheers!

				i would also love to see groceries enabled to sell wine. when i go back to visit my mom in ohio, we end up picking up wine at a grocery near her home, since the closest good wine store is out in the suburbs and we&#039;re inner city folk. the grocery runs the gamut from A to, say, L. in other words, from dirt-cheap stuff i can&#039;t drink to good, solid 20 dollar bottles. nothing too fancy, nothing obscure, but something for most occasions. and for what it&#039;s worth, contessa, my tastes in reds mirror yours. whites, i gravitate towards pinot blancs and pinot gris(es).

				There are a few things we need to keep in mind.&nbsp; Firstly, what type of wine would you expect from Met and Trade Fair.&nbsp; We can get cheap wines anywhere.&nbsp; I am not so sure they would know a good bottle of wine if it bit them on the nose.&nbsp; They would probably lock up any wine more than 8.99!!! That would cut the convenience factor immeasurably.&nbsp; Secondly and most importantly, it would be the further deterioration of neighborhoods.&nbsp; Small businesses&nbsp; like Table Wine would lose out and we as a community would lose out.&nbsp; We don&#039;t want to perpetuate more, .99cent stores, drugstores, money wire stores, hairdressers or tax prep offices.&nbsp; We need to help the small merchant, support them and urge other merchants to open ( real estate issues are a BIG problem i.e. MV Bagel Cafe going out &gt;:().&nbsp; I think we live in Jackson Heights for the flavor of the neighborhood and we want to see varied merchants and restaurants open.&nbsp;

				I think the convenience factor comes into play with stores that are open late or, like Trade fair, 24 hours.<br /><br />But good quality wine lovers will still seek out establishments like Table Wine.
