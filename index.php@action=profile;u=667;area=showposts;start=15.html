					I&#039;m seriously less concerned about the aesthetics and more concerned about our taxpayer dollars being used to subsidize a cost that should be covered by building owners. $50K can go a long way in other initiatives led by the BID.

					The BID does seem to address my list and more so far, and I truly wish them all the best as their success would translate to the community&#039;s success. All I am saying is that the grant could have been earmarked for whatever the BID chose (the BID did the earmarking not the grant from what I understand) and as a taxpayer, I would have liked to see my dollars go to something of more importance, but thanks for the link to a Google search. What do others think?

					How do folks feel about the news signs? I personally am not a fan, but do respect that the intention is to comply with our neighborhood&#039;s landmark status. What really bothers me, however, is that the $50,000 grant (not sure about the source of the other $150,000) that was used to change these private businesses&#039; signs were taxpayer dollars as the grant came from the City. It seems to me that there are more important things on 82nd Street and/or Roosevelt Avenue that could have been addressed with those dollars: security, even more lighting, even more garbage pick-ups, an anti-littering campaign, you name it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/24283173/article-Historic-storefronts-on-82nd-St--get-a-makeover" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/24283173/article-Historic-storefronts-on-82nd-St--get-a-makeover</a><br /><br />Historic storefronts on 82nd St. get a makeover<br /><br />by Andrew Shilling<br />12.24.13 - 09:20 am<br /><br />Businesses on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights recently received grant money from the city to further their beautification initiative.<br /><br />The Storefront Restoration Grant Program is an initiative led by the 82nd Street Partnership. Last week, seven ground floor storefronts and three upper floor facades between 37th and Roosevelt avenues took advantage of nearly $200,000 in grant funding for a much-needed makeover.<br /><br />&quot;The 82nd Street Partnership&#039;s Storefront Restoration Grant Program is one of many ways we work to improve quality of life in the Jackson Heights business improvement district,” said Seth Taylor, executive director of the 82nd Street Partnership.<br /><br />Through the $50,000 Neighborhood Challenge, three businesses were able to remove nearly 20 Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) violations and work towards expanding their customer base. <br /><br />“By restoring older storefronts with new signs, windows, lights, and awnings, we&#039;re making shops more attractive and inviting, which ultimately helps our mom-and-pop merchants retain and expand their customer base,” Taylor said. “Ultimately, the goal of this program is to help preserve retail diversity and enhance the neighborhood&#039;s architecture and sense of place.&quot;<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras congratulated Taylor and the 82nd Street Partnership last week on the improvements.<br /><br />“With this award, a new milestone is marked not only for our deserving local businesses, but also for the 82nd Street Partnership, who have been committed to enhancing the quality of life for our community,” Ferreras said. “Through our joint collaboration, I am confident that the quality of life for everyone in our community will only continue to improve.”

					At the next meeting of the New Visions Democratic Club, candidates for City Council Speaker will come to speak to us and share their vision for the future of the city. The meeting will be <strong>Thursday, November 14 at 6pm in the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, 37-06 77 Street</strong>. <br /><br />As you know, the Speaker is elected by Council members and is primarily responsible for obtaining a consensus on major issues, calling bills for a vote and doling out funding among council districts. He or she will play a critical role in shaping the next four years of New York City in the fourth most important post.<br /><br />The election to replace Christine Quinn, the current Speaker, will not take place until January, after those elected in November take office, but campaigns for the post have been under way for months. <br /><br />While New York City residents cannot vote for Speaker, it is important we are all educated on the role and voice our thoughts on how our city’s legislative body operates. <br /><br />Please join us on <strong>Thursday, November 14 at 6pm in the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, 37-06 77 Street</strong>. <br /><br />Feel free to email me offline with any questions at <a href="mailto:jesoram@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">jesoram@gmail.com</a>.

Please don&#039;t forget to go out and vote for your candidates of choice, but there are also six proposed amendments to the State&#039;s constitution for your consideration. They will be on the back side of your ballot, so don&#039;t forget to flip it!<br /><br />Little has been said about most of these ballot initiatives, but it is important to understand what&#039;s being suggested, so here are the proposed amendments for you to think about before heading to the polls tomorrow: <br /><br /><strong>Proposal One: Authorizing Casino Gaming </strong><br /><br />This is really the only proposal that has received at least some press coverage. The proposal is to allow the legislature to authorize and regulate up to seven casinos across the state. <br /><br /><strong>Proposal Two: Additional Civil Service Credit for Veterans with Disabilities Certified Post-Appointment </strong><br /><br />This proposed amendment would permit veterans who are certified disabled after having already received credit at one appointment or promotion to receive additional civil service credit a second time after certification of their disability. <br /><br /><strong>Proposal Three: Exclusion of Indebtedness Contracted for Sewage Facilities </strong><br /><br />The purpose for this one is to continue to allow counties, cities, towns, and villages to exclude from their constitutional debt limits indebtedness incurred for the construction or reconstruction of sewage facilities.<br /><br /><strong>Proposal Four: Settling Disputed Title in the Forest Preserve</strong> <br /><br />This amendment would allow the legislature to settle 100-year old disputes between the state and owners of land in the forest preserve by giving up the State&#039;s claim to disputed parcels. In exchange, the State would receive land for incorporation into the forest preserve.<br /><br /><strong>Proposal Five: In Relation to a Land Exchange in the State Forest Preserve with NYCO Minerals, Inc. </strong><br /><br />This amendment would allow the State to convey approximately 200 forest preserve acres to NYCO Minerals for mining. In exchange, NYCO Minerals would give the State as much or more land of at least the same value, with a minimum assessed value of $1 million. This land would be added to the forest preserve.<br /><br /><strong>Proposal Six: Increasing Age Until Which Certain State Judges Can Serve </strong><br /><br />This measure increases the maximum age until which Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Court of Appeals may serve to 80. This is upon certification of need and competence. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know where to vote?
