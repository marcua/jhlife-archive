				I&#039;m interested in hearing your stories about your kitchen renovation.&nbsp; <br /><br />How did you decide on the design and materials?&nbsp; <br />Did you visit many showrooms first or head straight for Ikea/Home Depot?&nbsp; <br />Did you get a general contractor or just hire invidual jobs out (electrician, etc.)<br />How difficult/expensive was demolition (esp. if you had an original kitchen)?<br />How did you determine your budget and did it change in the middle of the project?<br /><br />Anything else you can tell me would be really helpful even if it seems really elementary.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done a renovation, am not particularly handy or design-oriented (though I definitely can tell good design from bad - it&#039;s just that I have a hard time envisioning a good design beforehand).&nbsp; I also am a bit confused about the steps that are necessary when budget is an issue.

				No, it wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; But I think this kind of set-up (sometimes called a &quot;junior 4&quot;) is pretty common in Jackson Heights and also other neighborhoods where there are a lot of buildings from around 1940.<br /><br />Also, I spent the day thinking about it and I really don&#039;t know if I have the budget to re-do the kitchen now, but there&#039;s no harm in getting advice now, I guess, for future plans.

				We have a galley style kitchen and are also thinking about renovating real soon...possibly the fall.&nbsp; Our kitchen is small, so there are limited possibilities on what we can do with regard to decorating.&nbsp; What we want to focus on is adding more cabinet and counter space.&nbsp; <br /><br />From the minimal research that I&#039;ve done, I&#039;ve read that Ikea kitchen cabinets are pretty good quality and affordably priced.&nbsp; There&#039;s another place that I&#039;ve gone to out on Long Island called Consumers Kitchens &amp; Baths (http://www.consumerskitchens.com/), and they carry a good selection of Kraftmaid cabinets.&nbsp; I prefer the one on one attention that you get at a store like Consumers, but haven&#039;t really done price comparisons with stores like Ikea, Home Depot or Lowe&#039;s yet.&nbsp; For the floor, I&#039;d like to find out some more about cork flooring.&nbsp; Everyone tells me that it&#039;s a comfortable surface to stand on as opposed to ceramic or porcelain tiles...and I think it may be cheaper too and easier to maintain.<br /><br />We&#039;ve also been trying to figure out what appliances would be best for our kitchen.&nbsp; Sometimes what we&#039;ve wanted is not necessarily what would fit best.&nbsp; For instance, we&#039;ve been eyeing one of those refrigerators with French doors and a bottom freezer drawer.&nbsp; It turns out that the depth on this style refrigerator may be too deep. :(&nbsp; We&#039;ll have to keep looking in the meantime.&nbsp; On color, since the kitchen is smallish, I&#039;m thinking that lighter colored appliances would be a better fit overall.<br /><br />I&#039;d also love to hear from folks that have done renovations.

				My wife and I are both architects. We used a combination of IKEA cabinets, great links from apartmenttherapy.com to get appliances very affordably, and a stainless steel counter manufacturer in SoHo that we&#039;ve used on restaurants before.<br /><br />IKEA is great quality for the price. Most people don&#039;t notice much of a difference between it and many of the Home Depot/Lowe&#039;s lines. They actually use the same construction methods and materials for the most part. It&#039;s not worth spending more money unless you&#039;re going to go with solid wood frames or special Italian or German hardware (even IKEA uses German Blum drawer slides!).<br /><br />Also, stainless steel as a counter is great. There&#039;s a reason commercial kitchens use it. I wouldn&#039;t recommend using natural stones as they need alot of maintenance. A quartz/resin surface is recommended if you want the &quot;look&quot; of stone without the maintenance.<br /><br />I would also however, recommend consulting with an architect to at least help you come up with a good layout, especially if you have as large a kitchen as most of the co-ops in Jackson Heights have.<br /><br />:)

If the walls and ceiling are PLUM and you want to keep it inexpensive simply replace the old cabinets with new ones of the same dimensions.&nbsp; This will save you lots of money.&nbsp; Once you start rearranging the appliances it can get a bit expensive since outlet, electrical and gas lines can add to your bottom line in a big way.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Crown moldings, custom cabinets and specialty tops can quadruple the price ta tag not careful.&nbsp; I typically use a supplier in Jamaica that offers solid wood cabinets with plywood sides and back.&nbsp; Based on my experience the cabinets would cost less than $2000 including the uncut material for the crown moldings and fillers as well as the refrigerator panel.&nbsp; Obviously demolition, preparation of the room and installation are extras.&nbsp; I would say that a nicely done but inexpensive kitchen should cost between 9 - 12k.&nbsp; It&#039;s important to PLUM walls and ceilings if you are taking the cabinets up to the ceilings so this will ad some $$$ to the budget in they are really bad shape.&nbsp; In a perfect world a gut job will produce the best end product since all the drywall, electrical and plumbing would be new.<div align="center"> <em><strong><br />Here are some before and after photos of a kitchens that is similar to yours we just finished a few weeks ago.

				Shelby, <br />We didn&#039;t do our own kitchen, but the previous owners finished it right before they left.&nbsp; They did Ikea cabinets, and they are pretty great.&nbsp; my only complaint is that the bolts show on the bottoms of the ones we have (though I&#039;m sure there are other style options that don&#039;t have that problem).&nbsp; The great part though is that any time we want to add to them or change something we just go to Ikea and get the new pieces.&nbsp; Its cheap and easy.&nbsp; You can swap drawers for shelves, and they have TONS of coordinating options.&nbsp; Obviously not as fancy as a really high end renovation, but I think they look quite nice, and we&#039;re happy with them. You can PM me and I can send you pics, if you want.

				How did you decide on the design and materials?&nbsp; <br />--We got lots of inspiration from Home Expo, the HGTV shows and from just window shopping.&nbsp; We wanted a European sleek design that was neutral for resale.&nbsp; Granite and stainless were our priorities.&nbsp; We ended up with Ikea cabinets which cost $2220 in entirety and look better than most &quot;fancy&quot; cabinets, the hardware is fabulous and sturdy.&nbsp; We added an island which gave more storage and seating.&nbsp; It gets lots of wows from visitors.<br /><br />Did you visit many showrooms first or head straight for Ikea/Home Depot?&nbsp; <br />--IKEA and HOME EXPO and HOME DEPOT, Tiles from MARINO on Northern<br />--Lights from Flushing Electrical behind home depot in Flushing<br /><br />Did you get a general contractor or just hire invidual jobs out (electrician, etc.)<br />--We priced LABOR only with General Contractor and bought all materials.&nbsp; Worked in our favor.&nbsp; Most contractors that buy their own materials pad the numbers.<br /><br />How difficult/expensive was demolition (esp. if you had an original kitchen)?<br />--Demo labor was priced in, I remember construction material trash cost us $900 extra, probably to bribe the garbage guys.<br /><br />How did you determine your budget and did it change in the middle of the project?<br />--We budgeted and went 20% over.&nbsp; <br /><br />TIME committment-- you need @ 3 mos to research and 4 mos of renovations where you will be making last minute changes and picking details.&nbsp; keep your work schedule light --no big projects at work.&nbsp; you need lots of runs to home depot for last minute stuff.&nbsp; We trusted our contractor who bought many items for us and gave us receipts, so we had less running around.&nbsp; It turned out to be a bigger job than we both expected.<br /><br />Spending--We invested in middle to upper mid quality for tile, fixtures and appliances.&nbsp; In most cases we didn&#039;t buy anything designer.&nbsp; We are probably transitioning through JH so we didn&#039;t want to overspend and not recoup our costs.&nbsp; If you are staying in your apt forever, the sky&#039;s the limit, but if you are transitioning, better to spend with resale in mind.<br />

				Greentea-<br /><br />Concerning the bolts showing on the bottom, I assume you are referring to the bottom of the upper cabinets. The thing that IKEA may not have told the previous owner is that you can purchase blank panels to cover all of those exposed bolts (essentially it&#039;s the blank side panels you would put on the end of a line of cabinets, you just install them horizontally isntead). We did this with our cabinets and it looks great. No bolts are exposed at all underneath our cabinets. Our contractor did a great job clamping these all together and screwing them in from the inside so nothing is exposed. It looks like a high-end Italian kitchen for a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />See, there is a reason to consult with an architect...<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				I would love to replace my cabinets and counters one day!&nbsp; I&#039;ve already replaced the fridge and stove and removed a breakfast bar that was unnecessary.&nbsp; My problem is with the backsplash.&nbsp; The previous owner tiled the backsplash over plaster walls.&nbsp; When I do go about replacing the cabinets and counters, I&#039;d like to replace the backsplash too.&nbsp; It&#039;s a putrid pink and I honestly believe they were meant for a bathroom.&nbsp; Hubby and I plan to do most of the work ourselves using IKEA cabinets and their butcherblock counters (yes, I know wood isn&#039;t good near water, but we do plan to seal and maintain them with oil); however, we know just by having tried, that these tiles are going to be a @#$% to take off.&nbsp; They will most likely take chunks of plaster off with them.&nbsp; Has anyone encountered this problem and figured out a solution that saves the plaster walls?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to put up drywall as a solution but that&#039;s what it&#039;s looking like...

				I would just take it out and put up greenboard or tilebacker in it&#039;s place. <br /><br />It&#039;s best to put in new studs along side the old to level and even everything out before you put up the greenboard. If you don&#039;t, your wall will probably be out of alignment and you&#039;ll have a weird condition between the wall and your countertop.

				<strong>FYI<br /><br />If you look at magazines and choose 2 or 3 different options just show them to your contractor and ask for two prices.&nbsp; A price for labor and a price with labor and material.&nbsp; You will want to hire the countertop separately so you can get exactly what you want.&nbsp; If you are lucky you can get the contractor to take you to view some of his work.&nbsp; If you like something a lot simply have them duplicate it with a few personal touches like choice of lighting, countertops and the like.&nbsp; If you are not sure don&#039;t start the job otherwise a 1 - 2 week job will become a 2 month project.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take care to measure properly and order the cabinets and if possible get the &quot;off the rack&quot; kind to avoid the delay and expense with manufacturing custom cabinets.&nbsp; Choose all of your items like floor tiles, color of walls, lighting and once you have this items start your demo and do all of your electrical and electrical modifications if applicable.&nbsp; As your electrical and plumbing is completed initiate any drywall work immediately and without delay. Prime all the walls and level and install your floor tile or any other flooring you may have chosen.&nbsp; By this time you should already have the countertop people schedule since a good contractor will know exactly when the cabinets will be up.&nbsp; Once the tile is grouted and cleaned you can either give the walls one coat of paint of both coats.&nbsp; Install your cabinets and run your under cabinet lighting (by this time your countertop people should be in).<br /><br />Here is my take on a full kitchen renovation.<br /><br />Day 1...Demo, garbage removal and electrical rough(if applicable)<br />Day 2...Plumbing rough (if applicable), drywall work commence<br />Day 3...Drywall completed, prime walls and prime and paint the ceilings (schedule delivery of cabinets for day 5 in the AM and countertop contractor for the later PM)<br />Day 4...Level flooring and install flooring <br />Day 5...Grout tiles and install cabinets including crown and base moldings if possible<br />Day 6...If you have not finished the moldings and lighting/fixtures detail work you may need this extra day to complete it.<br /><br />Now you wait for the granite contractor to have it ready. It should take between 3 to 5 days before they are ready to install.&nbsp; In the meantime your General Contractor (GC) can install a temporary plywood top and workinf sink while you wait.<br /><br />Day 7...Countertops and back splash are installed.&nbsp; If you are tiling the back splash make sure your GC is there the day of the installation so he can install the backsplash immediately.&nbsp; Also, your faucet will be installed ans well as an caulking as well.&nbsp; You may need 1 man for a few hours or even 1 day for touching up the paint and odds &amp; ins</strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><br />If your kitchen project is less involved it can take as little as 2 or 3 days but regardless of how involved the kitchen project is it really should not take longer than 10 work days if you plan properly.</span>

				Fascinating reading the kitchen thread, thanks for posting. <br /><br />I am planning my renovation and am wondering if anyone has moved their gas range from one wall to another. <br /><br />Who did the job? <br />how much did it cost (I got one estimate that seems pretty high)? <br />did you get a DOB (ARA) permit, was is extra, how much was that? <br />did you run into any unexpected issues? <br /><br />Thanks a bunch,<br /><br />Julia

				Sorry I keep asking silly questions but this is my first kitchen renovation and I&#039;m going nuts. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the question: I am looking into sinks and I&#039;d like a deeper than regular one (ideally 10&quot; but 9 would do as well). I have narrowed it down to Liena Bay, Empire or Blanco but the first two are more reasonably priced. Have you had any experience with either Liena Bay or Empire?

				Hi - I&#039;m looking for recommendations on someone to remodel my kitchen - needs to be a designer too, not just a contractor, because I&#039;m thinking of tearing down walls, and need some help with the &quot;vision.&quot; Anyone had any great experiences? <br />Thanks!<br />

				<strong>This one was going really fast since I had a buyer for it before I began the demo.&nbsp; All was well except for the fact that the seller requested a credit for his refrigerator because he was going get his own.&nbsp; Unfortunately the buyer, the seller and the lawyers forgot to tell me.&nbsp; I mean, so what, I&#039;m only the Broker and the FREAKING CONTRACTOR!&nbsp; It didn&#039;t crossed anyone to tell me that it was a side by side and that since I was the one designing the layout of the kitchen I should have had an idea of what was coming.&nbsp; I always end up using the landlords standard refrigerators (1 door).&nbsp; Anyway, I had to redesign the breakfast bar and the granite counter (Did I mention I was out 2 man days and $375 for the counter)<br /><br />The final product still came out nice but this is a reminder that appliances must be incorporated into the design of a kitchen.&nbsp; Failure to do this will limit your choices in appliances.</strong><br /><div align="center">(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0342.jpg?t=1244292271)<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0338.jpg?t=1244292317)<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0341.jpg?t=1244292362)<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0349.jpg?t=1244292403)</div>

				<strong>I had the worst experience in doing a small kitchen in Jackson Hts a while ago.&nbsp; Employees being trained, Ikea cabinets with missing hardware, dust controls flawed, difficult Board, Damaged granite counter tops from factory.&nbsp; You name it, it happend.&nbsp; I was lucky the client was really understanding and saw things for what they were.&nbsp; This was the only time that I really considered firing a supervisor on the spot...He actually let a trainee install a mosaic tile back splash.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even want to remember&nbsp; :(<br /><br />After having the supervisor return to the apartment 2 times to fix all the F&#039; ups the project did turn out nice.

				Hello Everyone, <br />I&#039;d just like to publicly post a big thank you to NYC Native.&nbsp; Everyone sees the construction work he does online, as well as his funny messages, but for those who don&#039;t know him personally, I can attest that he is a very stand up individual.&nbsp; I am the one with the nightmare kitchen pics he posted awhile back.&nbsp; <br /><br />My kitchen was a big pain in the butt, and when it didn&#039;t go as easily as planned, it created a huge mess and one part didn&#039;t end up exactly I planned.&nbsp; I was upset, but there wasn&#039;t really anything I could do about it.&nbsp; It still looks great, but it&#039;s not exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; He knew this and apologized many times, but there wasn&#039;t anything that could be done at that point.<br /><br />So, this year I decided to attack my bathroom myself.&nbsp; I posted a question about the floor and didn&#039;t get a lot of responses.&nbsp; I really needed a tile saw, but had never used one myself, and wasn&#039;t very comfortable with the idea.&nbsp; 14 months after my kitchen was completed, I contacted him asking if he knew of any stores I could bring tiles to and get them cut because home depot and lowes wouldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I was shocked when he offered to send one of his guys to come over to cut and lay my tile for me.&nbsp; It was really unbelieveable and one of the nicest things I&#039;ve ever heard of a contractor doing.&nbsp; He said he owed me because of the problem with my kitchen.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t expecting anything, but now my floor looks fantastic.&nbsp; It was really above and beyond anything I could have asked for.&nbsp; And for all you looking to do renovations to your apartments, I would highly recommend giving him a call.&nbsp; He&#039;ll explain everything and go out of his way so you understand the whole process.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks Luis, I really owe you one!<br />Joe

				<strong>Wow...Thanks &nbsp;:). &nbsp;You didn&#039;t have to post but I appreciate it...your job was the most drama filled...NOT BECAUSE OF YOU...but The Mgmt and I also placed a couple of new guys so we could train them and the granite guys along with the missing hardware made your job one for the books. &nbsp;But you know...Your kitchen looks really nice and in big BIG PART (99%) because of your excellent taste. &nbsp;You chose everything and it really came together. &nbsp;BTW, You don&#039;t owe me &nbsp;:o ...I still owe you..<br /><br />Be well Mr. K</strong>
