				Maria Sroka is a long-time animal-loving resident of Jackson Heights who will arrange her schedule around yours for the loving care of your furry, feathered and finned friends (plants included!). 718-898-0440. <br /><br />Many more two- and four-legged references upon request in addition to the below:<br /><br />&quot;Maria Sroka was more than a dog-walker or pet-sitter; she was my dog’s best friend.&nbsp; She went above and beyond to care for him while I was away at work.&nbsp; My dog is sensitive, shy and takes time to warm up to new people, but he could immediately feel Maria’s love for him and he was a happy boy!&nbsp; She would always walk him carefully, not allowing him to ever get into trouble or harm’s way, and she would make him feel so special.&nbsp; She always left him super fresh water and a little note for me about how he felt and behaved that day.&nbsp; She took the weight of the world off of my shoulders, as my dog means the world to me.&nbsp; Maria is the kindest and most responsible person, always trustworthy and reliable.&nbsp; I live on the other side of the city now, but if I can’t care for my Doberman during the day I will only ever call Maria.&quot;<br />-Lara, professional ballerina and satisfied client
