				It seems like it&#039;s a slow market right now, so we&#039;ve reduced the price on this room to $650. Here are the details:<br /><br />This is a beautiful apartment! I&#039;ve looked around recently, and you won&#039;t get anything this nice for the price. Pre-war building in the Jackson Heights Historical District, hardwood floors, lots of light, lovely views. It&#039;s only 3 blocks from the 7 train at 82nd St, and less than 15 minutes from the E, F, R and V at 74th St-Roosevelt.<br /><br />It&#039;s a sunny medium-sized bedroom with a view of a church, trees and garden. Lots of closet space (you could fit a twin bed in there with room left over). The room is unfurnished, but the rest of the apartment is tastefully decorated, and there is plenty of cooking utensils to share in the eat-in kitchen. Share bathroom with only one of us (it&#039;s a duplex apartment, and the attic bedroom has an ensuite.)<br /><br />You&#039;ll be sharing the apartment with two guys: a mid 30s artist and late 20s musician (don&#039;t worry, I don&#039;t practice at home.) We&#039;re pretty quiet and keep the place clean, and we&#039;d appreciate that from you too. It&#039;s a drug-free apartment too (unfortunately that needs to be said). Alcohol&#039;s ok, but we don&#039;t smoke.<br /><br />$650 per month, first month&#039;s rent and deposit when moving in, and we split gas, electricity and internet (it comes to about $40 each, all up.) The landlord will need to check your credit.<br /><br />We&#039;re showing the apartment now! If you send a phone number, you&#039;ll get a quicker response.<br /><br />Photos below show the room (bed not included. There is a curtain rod inside the French doors, so you can put up a curtain), and the view from the bedroom.
