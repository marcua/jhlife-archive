				I&#039;d like to share the interesting Jackson Heights-style breakfast choices I have had recently on my way to the subway in the morning and ask if anyone has any other good choices:<br /><br />Tamale lady on Roosevelt between 75th and 76th (just right of La Abundancia)&nbsp; - These are the best tamales I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood and only a buck apiece. Several flavors includ red, green, mole and cheese. She will also put them on a torta roll for you although I haven&#039;t tried this.<br /><br />Double Rainbow - Great chinese bakery with a pretty impressive dim sum menu available every day. Most of the dim sum items are about $2 and one order is enough for me. There are also pork buns and tons of different savory and sweet pastries.<br /><br />If anyone knows of anything else in a similar vein that I could grab on my way to work please let me know. Especially Indian or Himalayan food. Colombian or South American might be cool too. Thanks!<br /><br />

				Outside of the box for breakfast, but the onigiri from 969 NYC Coffee are nice. He also uses Joe coffee and has nice matcha lattes.

				For those with a sweet tooth, the churros with dulce de leche at La Gran Uruguaya are fantastic.<br /><br />And the empanadas are terrific as well.

				La Casa De Los Antojitos is a Colombian bakery/diner on 37th between 81st and 82nd that is open early and has empanadas and stuff. Sometimes I grab something there on my way to the 7 train.<br /><br />Lety&#039;s, on 37th between 77th and 78th, has very cheap coffee and very delicious pastries.

				Just want to add two more interesting options I&#039;ve found:<br /><br /><strong>Lotus wrapped sticky rice from Fay Da</strong>. There is fatty pork, chinese sausage and mushrooms in the rice. They have this at Double Rainbow as well but this one is better. The filling is really amazing. Also want to try the buns here.<br /><br /><strong>Mangu from Espinal Deli 2</strong>. This is in Woodside, but if you ever find yourself going to the Northern Boulevard M/R subway stop, this is only 4 blocks away. Mangu is a Dominican dish of mashed plantains with toppings like fried cheese, salami, sausage, etc.. In Puerto Rico they call it mofongo. This version is delicious. You could also pick up lunch food and bring it with you which is what I will do next time. Their pernil looked delicious.

				Following-up on mofongo...&nbsp; I was driving along Roosevelt Ave. in Woodside yesterday and noticed that there&#039;s a new mofongo place, <strong>NOMA Paellas &amp; Mofongos House</strong>.&nbsp; The food pics on their Facebook page are nice, but wondering if anyone has tried it yet.&nbsp;

				The new Fay Da (across from Pacific Supermarket on Broadway) is an excellent addition to the neighborhood! I&#039;ve tried the steamed pork buns, chicken buns, and curry beef puff so far. All are excellent. They also have coffee and bubble tea, along with a lot of other sweet and savory pastries.

				I feel bad for Double Rainbow bakery. They&#039;re good people but Fay Da is essentially Shake Shack

				Rainbow does do a really good version of that sticky rice in lotus leaves - but they make very few and they sell out early. same with the rest of the items in their steam tray.

				If you have time to sit down for breakfast at a restaurant (as opposed to walk-while-you-eat), El Rico Tinto is among the best in the neighborhood.<br /><br />

				I would like to add Las Delicias Colombianas (OK I know I have messed up the Spanish spelling..). It&#039;s the little place on 82nd on the way to the 7 on the left-hand side, next to Coco Bubble Tea. The cafe con leche is really good, as are the pastries. I often get their chicken soup for lunch: $4.50 for a big container.
