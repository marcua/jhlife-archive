				I read your post and remembered that someone had recently posted about pet sitting services.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a quote from a thread found in the Business Listings and Services Directory (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=9128.msg50902#msg50902) board on JHL.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=9128.msg50902.html#msg50902">Quote from: nickfowler on September 27, 2013, 06:16:50 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maria Sroka is a long-time animal-loving resident of Jackson Heights who will arrange her schedule around yours for the loving care of your furry, feathered and finned friends (plants included!). 718-898-0440. <br /><br />Many more two- and four-legged references upon request in addition to the below:<br /><br />&quot;Maria Sroka was more than a dog-walker or pet-sitter; she was my dog’s best friend.&nbsp; She went above and beyond to care for him while I was away at work.&nbsp; My dog is sensitive, shy and takes time to warm up to new people, but he could immediately feel Maria’s love for him and he was a happy boy!&nbsp; She would always walk him carefully, not allowing him to ever get into trouble or harm’s way, and she would make him feel so special.&nbsp; She always left him super fresh water and a little note for me about how he felt and behaved that day.&nbsp; She took the weight of the world off of my shoulders, as my dog means the world to me.&nbsp; Maria is the kindest and most responsible person, always trustworthy and reliable.&nbsp; I live on the other side of the city now, but if I can’t care for my Doberman during the day I will only ever call Maria.&quot;<br />-Lara, professional ballerina and satisfied client<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Hopefully this will end up in the right spot for someone to see..<br /><br />We are looking for a dog walker who is available for 1 walk a day, M-F, mid-day, and then be flexible to do a 7pm walk on occasions where we will not be home. Of course these 7pms would be most likely be set up in advance, as we are not looking for something crazy like an &quot;on call&quot; walker. This is preemptive as we are in the process of getting a new dog (we lost our dog a year and a half ago...read that as put to sleep, not literally lost :) Writing as we are on 85th st between 35/37, and a lot of the services offered average around 75-80th sts. Let me know if this is enough to go on, or if more details are needed. We did not previously have a walker, but thought with our next one it may be beneficial. thanks!

				My husband and I are considering moving over to NY Paw Pals. We interviewed the owner and thought he is great.&nbsp; We&#039;re waiting for somehting to work out, then we will make our decision, but if we didn&#039;t move over to Paw Pals,&nbsp; it would just be a matter of circumstances, not a lack of positive feeling about Paw Pals. They really do seem to have a great set-up. Honestly I would recommend that you check them out, I really was impressed.

				There are a few threads on dog walkers but all are at least a few years old. In the process of getting a dog and would love to hear recommendations from people happy with their dog walker (ideally someone you&#039;ve been using a long time).<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen Anella&#039;s Trails and Tails and NY Paw Pals come up a few times. Curious to hear about people&#039;s experiences with them or with other walkers. We would need midday walks about 3x a week.<br /><br />This feels like an important decision and so important to find someone trustworthy and kind. Really don&#039;t want to roll the dice on this one.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!

				I use a local woman named Karin for walks during the day. She&#039;s very reliable, and always sends a text message (often with a picture) telling me how the walk went. Let me know if you&#039;d like her contact info.<br />For day care and/or boarding I use Janet of Bed &amp; Biscuits and can&#039;t speak more highly of her. I think my dog likes Janet more than she likes me! Janet includes pick up and drop off and gathers up a bunch of neighborhood pups to run around in a dog park nearby. My doggo loves it and comes home tired every day.<br />I would strongly caution AGAINST using NY Paw Pals. They lost my dog while I was out of town - thankfully we found her after 2 days of searching, but it was terrible. To make matters worse, every time I asked them what happened, their story changed. They were very nice people but I just don&#039;t trust them.
