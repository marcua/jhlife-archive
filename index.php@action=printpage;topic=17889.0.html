				There has been a car alarm going off intermittently since about 10:15am. (I&#039;m on 75th &amp; 37th) I&#039;ve put in a few requests to 311. It&#039;s driving me crazy - I&#039;m working from home today! What are we supposed to do in this situation other than call 311?

				it sure would be a shame if car-alarm cars got nicely damaged&nbsp; - in some way that indicated hundreds of people&#039;s lives being interrupted for minutes or hours. <br /><br />i mean, that&#039;s why the alarm is going off, yes? to tell the owner that something is happening to their car? <br /><br />why disappoint them with a &quot;false alarm&quot;?<br /><br />--<br /><br />in seriousness: car alarms should be banned. for granfathered-in-ppl, your responsibility to make sure it doesn&#039;t go off.&nbsp; if you have an alarm that goes off: ticket like a parking infraction.<br />&nbsp;3 strikes and your car gets towed. monies collected by the city in a fund to work on noise abatement.....someone could dream....

				when my ex and i owned a house here -- one of the Spanish ones on 75th -- people would often park illegally up against our patio, on the community driveway. if the car stayed for a long while, we&#039;d leave a note. written on duct tape that papered the driver&#039;s side windshield.<br /><br />that might be a little risky on a public street -- or illegal, even, but this was private property....

A car alarm should signify a serious concern, like a broken window. If the window isn&#039;t broken before the alarm goes off, then it only makes sense to me that the window should be broken as soon as it goes off, to justify the alarm.

				as a lifelong non-driver, i must ask...is there a way to &quot;set&quot; the alarm so that it&#039;s not so sensitive that it goes off due to a truck going by or some other nonsense?

				Sorry that you&#039;re dealing with this. I&#039;ve occasionally called the 115th, and on a couple of occasions 311 forwarded me to 911. One time the police showed up 7 hours later, by which time I was on the verge of a breakdown. <br /><br />I vote for banning the supplementary car alarms. Cars these days all have integrated car alarms, that would kick in in the event of serious concerns. The rest are just annoying, expensive and possibly ineffective, as indicated by this incident.
