				My building (73rd St, not 75th) recently had a few incidents with a former tenant exposing himself in the basement.&nbsp; He was able to get into the complex because people recognized him and let him enter behind them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think he actually assaulted anyone, so I have a feeling it&#039;s a completely different occurrence than the one posted above.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know what response you want- you just said that people had been assaulted and you don&#039;t know anything about it. You didn&#039;t really give a point to comment on. It&#039;s horrible, but is that what you&#039;re looking for? Do you want a call to action? A backlash? A community self defense course? An awareness campaign?

				hi Marlene.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t respond for similar reason as abee&#039;s.&nbsp; Also, an arrest was made according to your post.<br /><br />I think everyone should be aware of who they let walk in behind them when entering their building.&nbsp; The other night I worked very late and came home and had to walk my dog.&nbsp; No one was around.&nbsp; It was quiet and peaceful out.&nbsp; Again, I saw no one. <br /><br />As I entered my building&#039;s vestibule and just put the key into the door, I heard someone behind me.&nbsp; I quickly turned and a young Hispanic guy was standing there very close to me.&nbsp; I asked him if he lived here and he jangled keys and said &quot;up&quot;.&nbsp; I was definitely taken by surprise at his sudden appearance and my &quot;radar&quot; was up.&nbsp; I opened the door and made sure to look over my shoulder at him again and he went the other way.&nbsp; As I was walking towards the elevator on my side of the building, I again looked over my shoulder and I swear he had his pants down and he was holding himself.&nbsp; I flew into my elevator and apartment and phoned the 115.&nbsp; A car drove past the building, shone a light, but didn&#039;t stop or come in.<br /><br />I was very annoyed with the police for not coming in but then I saw another police car and I thought since I gave a description, they spotted him on the street.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what ever happened after that.<br /><br />But as far as a call for action... what action?&nbsp; Community self defense?&nbsp; Most police stations will send someone to walk thru a building and talk about how it can be safer. But self defense?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they will do that.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Please don&#039;t twist my words or try to make me sound insensitive. That was unfair.<br /><br />I&#039;m not dismissing that what happened to them was disturbing and scary. But it sounds like an arrest was made and, thanks to the building&#039;s tenant association, we were made aware of what was going on. People did take action. I just don&#039;t see a reason to be pushed into living in fear because of it.

				As a man I too am appalled at the increase in assaults on women in Jackson Heights and I agree with Marlene that it is time for the community to come together and demand action from the police and our local officials.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s time for all of us, men (who have remained silent on this thread) and women to make our voices heard.<br /><br />

				The problem is, much like the gang violence &quot;emergency town hall&quot; these events turn in to an opportunity for local politicians to promote themselves, very little ever results from these things. We&#039;d probably be better served by attending the115th Pct. community council meetings, and CB3 meetings to marshal public support for increased police patrols, education campaigns etc. <br /><br />Ultimately the sad but true fact is the police can&#039;t be every where at all times.&nbsp; It&#039;s incumbent upon co-op boards and building owners to take part in securing their property. Cameras and door men or at least night watchmen / security guards&nbsp; do more to protect us than politicians trying to get elected.<br /><br />That being said, I do believe in and know SOME of our elected officials and trust that they actually try to do something. But one or two people can only do so much regardless of their position. It&#039;s better to start a campaign on a grass roots level and let the politicians follow it rather than us begging them for leadership on an issue. <br /><br />Every once in a while I&#039;ve noticed auxiliary police officers walking the neighborhood at night, maybe we can reach out to them and see what it takes to get increased patrols, or even start a community watch.<br /><br />The bottom line is there are options, and waiting for the electeds to do something isn&#039;t the best one.

				I went on FamilyWatchdog and there are so many people that one has no way of remembering everyone&#039;s face. If someone knows of someone acting up around here it would be nice to know who it is so we can keep a cautious eye out...that&#039;s all. It would be a shame for a repeat offense to occur.....I guess you don&#039;t want to violate this individual&#039;s right to privacy, but if he is a threat then it is a concern.....

				The remarks made here are not meant in any way to minimize the latest incident in the building on 75th St. (or violence against women in general), to excuse such behavior in any way, or to question how serious and frightening it was for the woman who was targeted. This is simply an effort to supply more information about what is known about the incident. I am a tenant in said building. I did not personally witness any of the following, but have spoken to various tenants who were involved.<br /><br />The individual who was arrested entered the building around 7 or so in the evening, apparently by waiting for someone to unlock the front door and then following in after them (our building has 100+ units and quite a lot of in-out traffic at this time of day). At some point a little later he entered the elevator, where a tenant, by herself, was going up to her floor. He remarked that she had very pretty feet. Taken aback, she simply said thank you and ignored him. He then asked if he could kiss them (her feet), but at this moment the door opened at her floor and she passed him and got out. As she headed away from the elevator she turned around to glance back and saw him exposing himself. She began to scream and ran toward her apartment. Hearing her screams, almost immediately several tenants came out into the halls, on her floor and others. A chase ensued down the stairs and several residents cornered and held the intruder in the lobby. Someone called 911 to report the incident and call for assistance. It apparently took 25-30 minutes for the police from 115 to respond.<br /><br />Several details: <br /><br />--the perpetrator appears to be Hispanic, probably in his 20s. <br />--he has been arrested before for exposing himself to women and I&#039;ve been told that he is registered as a sexual offender.<br />--he has not served time previously for offenses, but is now, with this latest offense, being held until a trial date sometime in October. This latest incident apparently violates conditions allowing him to avoid jail time previously, so there appears a better chance that he will now be given time.<br />--neither in this latest incident nor in early ones involving this individual was there any physical contact or &quot;assault&quot;--as far as I&#039;ve been able to ascertain (other than the obviously serious emotional/psychological assault). As I said, this is in no way meant to minimize the seriousness of this behavior!<br /><br />In general and perhaps more helpfully:<br /><br />This is the <span class="bbc_u">second</span> time this individual was behaving like this in our building. In the first instance (at least that we&#039;re aware of), 5 or 6 weeks ago, the super happened to pass him in the basement and, not recognizing him, asked him what he was doing. (Our building has outside entrances into the basement, so people are frequently passing through this level.) The young man left the building at that point, so the super went to our video security cameras and discovered that he had been hanging around the basement for half an hour or so, watching when women came down to enter the laundry room. This was approximately 6 PM in the evening, with a lot of activity in the building, in general. During this period he exposed himself several times without any of the women being aware of it (to the best of my knowledge). (They were in the laundry room, he was in the hallway outside, peering around the doorframe at them). At one point he waited out of sight until a young woman left the laundry and got in the elevator, then tried to run to the elevator and get in with her. Fortunately, the elevator door had already closed. A few minutes later the super encountered him and he left the building.<br /><br />In this previous case we were able to find video of him entering the main lobby door when someone from the building was leaving. We posted pictures of him (very sharp, easily identifiable images) in several locations besides the lobby, together with an alert to tenants to call 911 if he was seen. We also stressed the need to not let anyone enter the building that the tenant does not know. We left these photos and warnings up for a week. Subsequent to this latest incident we have again posted the photograph and the warnings and plea for tenant vigilance--along with a thank you to the many people who responded so quickly and effectively!<br /><br />The video camera system has been very helpful in this situation, allowing the latest incident to be taken in the context of a prior one, which may well make the difference in this man having to serve time and/or get additional help. The bottom line continues to be tenant awareness of those coming in and out of the building and being willing to &quot;be rude&quot; and not let people enter on the heels of someone else. A building&#039;s security measures are ultimately only as effective as the residents make them.<br />

				Maybe we feel more inclined to hold doors during the daytime, as we feel generally more safe-- but as this thread makes clear, there&#039;s no reason to assume a pervert is less likely to sneak in at 3 PM than 3 AM. I&#039;ve lived in my building for over a year and still see new faces almost every day. It&#039;s a big building, and we only have a doorman on weekday evenings. So I have to ask the obvious question: how do you deal with the everyday situations of entering and leaving a busy apartment building? <br />I realize that personal gut feelings play a big role, but still...If you&#039;re entering at the same time as someone else, and you get to the door first, are you supposed to close the door on the other person&#039;s face? Short of issuing building IDs to tenants, how are we supposed to police ourselves?

				One of the benefits of posting the perpetrator&#039;s photograph in our vestibule, alongside a brief description of the recent event, is that tenants can point them out to anyone trying to enter without their own key while the door&#039;s open and say, &quot;Sorry, but we&#039;re being extra vigilant here these days.&quot; It does appear to help in this regard. Other buildings might simply post a brief summary of our misfortune for the same purpose.

				I am&nbsp; horrified by the recent information regardint the 75th street incident.&nbsp; I am even more freaked out of the&nbsp; 73rd street super presumeably running a brothel!&nbsp; I also visited familywatchdog.com and I tried to remember the faces.&nbsp; I think that everyone should immediately call 911 when they see ANYONE acting strange.&nbsp; I was with my baby in the stroller on 82nd when I realized when I walked into the 3rd store on my little morning walk, that a guy was watching me in the aisles.&nbsp; The only reason I realized it was b/c it was the baby aisle and he was fully dressed with a baseball cap and a sweatshirt in the middle of June!&nbsp; I was so upset and scared b/c I didn&#039;t know how long he followed me or from where.&nbsp; I walked to the corner of 82nd where the police stand under the train.&nbsp; I told the cops to walk me home, when they said: &quot;m&#039;am, there is a man staring at you across the street.&nbsp; Is that the man?&quot;&nbsp; I was freaked out and strolled home so fast.&nbsp; Then three weeks ago, I called the police again at Traver&#039;s Park around 11 AM.&nbsp; I was with the baby playing by the sprinklers when it hit me,&nbsp; 3 lonely men on the bench watching the little kids jump in the sprinklers.&nbsp; I was so disgusted, i called the 115th precint and then was instructed to call 911.&nbsp; There is no reason for a lonely man or woman to be staring or hanging out in the playground if they do not have children there!&nbsp; Please, beware of these perverts.&nbsp; Report them and call 911 until you become the most annoying Jackson Heights Citizen.&nbsp; Believe me, they have my number by now.

				This thread has drifted from cautionary to alarmist. Time for me to make some pronouncements, so donâ€™t take me <em>too</em> seriously.<br /><br />I would like more information on the gay man said by KILLABOB to have run a brothel in a Jackson Heights apartment building. Anything in this world is possible, but â€œa brothel in the basement with young kidsâ€ (presumably referring to underage female prostitutes) seems (1) a little unlikely to have escaped the notice of tenants long enough to be lucrative, (2) an unlikely business to be run by a gay man, and (3) like the kind of incident the police would take quite seriously, rather than doing nothing. (â€œâ€¦they caught him but nothing was done. still see him around.â€) While the story may be 100% true, it doesnâ€™t have what Judge Judy calls â€œthe ring of truth.â€ Note by comparison how kurosâ€™ story, despite describing such an outrageous incident, is more informative, detailed, logical, likely, and has a more reasonable cause-and-effect narrative. Also note erospolitico was skeptical (â€œâ€¦ dunno how much truth there is to thatâ€¦â€), while miss6 readily accepted it (â€œI am even more freaked out of the 73rd street super presumeably [sic] running a brothel!â€). Did KILLABOB even say it was the superintendent? I thought he was changing the subject from the super to the gay brothel-keeper. (And for the record, nothing is â€œpolitically incorrectâ€ about referring to some gay guy as â€œsome gay guy.â€ I missed the â€œhomophobic overtones.â€)<br /><br />I am a man, so I do not know what being a woman in this dangerous culture is like, nor am I a parent, so I cannot comprehend the stresses of raising <del>rugâ€¦</del> children, but miss6â€™s posts seem very alarmist, although not necessarily inaccurate. I wasnâ€™t present for the incident described, so I can only judge by what was written, but I see nothing suspicious about someoneâ€™s wearing a baseball cap and sweatshirt in June, or being in the baby aisle when he could have been a young father. I would think his being â€œfully dressedâ€ would be preferable rather than suspect. â€œI didn&#039;t know how long he followed me or from whereâ€ could very well mean they were encountering each other for the first time. â€œIâ€¦strolled home so fastâ€ implies to me the police did not feel escorting her home to be warranted, but again, I wasnâ€™t there. I come from what eventually became a fairly rough-and-tumble section of the Bronx, and yet some senior citizens would sometimes park themselves on benches to rest and watch the children play. The highly judgmental language used to describe complete strangers (being â€œdisgustedâ€ by â€œ3 lonely menâ€ a.k.a. â€œthese pervertsâ€) when their intentions might have been innocent, especially when their presence wasnâ€™t even immediately evident (â€œI was with the baby playing by the sprinklers when it hit meâ€¦â€), was understandably met with skeptical questioning.<br /><br />My use of quotations, as usual, is intended to be illustrative and analytical rather than dismissive. I encourage everyone to read what is posted on any online bulletin board critically. With a simple click of the â€œPostâ€ button, anyone, including me, can be published on the Internet.

				hello, i read all your comments.&nbsp; I just want everyone to know that one of the men on the bench had a liquor bottle tucked in a newspaper under his arm and he was literally drinking and staring at the kids.&nbsp; The other two guys were just there staring.&nbsp; Perhaps they were daydreaming, but first impressions make lasting ones.&nbsp; I think that is alarming if you have little girls jumping through the water, and a drunkard only inches away from them.&nbsp; The parents were totally oblivious to the fact and I was shocked.&nbsp; The parents were too in tune with their conversations (mostly mothers) and I had to double check my own judgements before I made the call.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that it was so hot that the guys on the bench wanted some water sprinkled on them.&nbsp; I have to admit that I a little paranoid, only because I grew up in Jackson Heights and in the mid 80&#039;s &quot;chester the molester&quot; plagued the neighborhood.&nbsp;

I am very wary of public drunkenness. That is probably what I find most contributes to my feeling of being endangered: drunk people stumbling out of saloons and looking for confrontation. (At the very least, they&#8217;re looking for food and then leave their bottles, styrene containers and food scraps on the sidewalk.)<br /><br />P.S., NYC Native, you can spell <em>parthenogenesis</em> but you can&#8217;t spell my name? The letter <em>u</em> appears nowhere in my name from beginning to end, let alone after the <em>q</em>. But please call me <em>Marque</em>, I mean <em>Mark</em>. ;-)

I am originally from Kingsbridge but lived most of my life in Baychester. Maybe we need a thread specifically about Bronx refugees in northwestern Queens.
