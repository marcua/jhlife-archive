				I&#039;m 61, left the Heights in 1967, returned to NY in 1969. I was in a band from 1965 to 1967, the Figments of Imagination. Members: Henry Hom, Neal Resnick, Michael Kemper, Frank Robbins and me, Ron Malpeli.<br /><br />Anybody else in a band, or remember bands from that era?<br /><br />

				that&#039;s so cool :)<br /><br />any tapes lying around? you could get in touch with one of those labels that does obscurities records from bands who put out singles in pressings of 100 or so, or even no records at all.

				I was still a Figment of My Parents&#039; Imagination when you had your band.&nbsp; You must have had so much fun. What kind of music did you play?&nbsp; Did you have matching haircuts?&nbsp;

				Found this a little late...<br /><br />Did you practice at the Hom&#039;s house on 90th Street and 32nd Ave?&nbsp; I lived next door and was best friends with Albert Hom.&nbsp; We were just little kids back then, but I loved watching the band play in the living room.&nbsp; And sometimes they&#039;d let me play the tamborine&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Great memories!

				Hi Holly! <br /><br />Please allow me to ask you about Billy, your uncle.<br />I always liked to think of Billy as my older brother.&nbsp; <br />I am George, Albert&#039;s brother. I hope I am not being too intrusive.<br /><br />-George

				Waddy Waddell who achieved later fame by being the number 1 session guitarist in LA (Linda Ronstadt) and Keith Richard&#039;s X Pensive Winos, played with his band at my 6th grade graduating class at PS 69 in 1964. He was an alumni there. I remember they did some Beatles songs and a Levitation trick. I took some photos but it looks like my mother threw them out! Weird thing was 14-16 years later, when I was working in San Diego and Minneapolis, I made friends with 2 people who when I mentioned I was from Jackson Heights, were best friends with him and his wife.
