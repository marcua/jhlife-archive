					People who have the gumption to travel thousands of miles from their home country to try to make a new life here generally have a positive contribution to make â€“ even if they do start off dirt poor or relatively uneducated.&nbsp; Weâ€™ve seen this over and over again, both in American history as a whole --&nbsp; and particularly in the more recent history of neighborhoods here in Queens like JH (and Astoria, Flushing, Elmhurst etc.) which have been transformed by the energies and initiatives of new immigrant communities.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I think weâ€™d have a lot more to worry about if new people stopped coming to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; <br />

					By all means investigate incidents and the reasons behind putting up the polcie tower.&nbsp; It is extremely important for people to be knowledgeable&nbsp; about and vigilant against crime in the neighborhood, including any uptick in crime. The incident at the falafel cart is obviously revolting and inexcusable. <br /><br />At the same time, it seems to me that some of the statements on the other thread about Roosevelt â€“ ie that it should be avoided at all costs, that it is not safe day or night â€“ were exaggerated and from my perspective as a long time resident, not really warranted based on current conditions on Roosevelt.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is important that discussions about crime be grounded in reality.&nbsp; I understand there are real problems along Roosevelt, particularly with quality of life issues. But it also seems like there are&nbsp; countless people who patronize bars, restaurants and businesses in that area every day and late into the evening, mostly without incident.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />For me a dangerous neighborhood is a neighborhood full of gunfire, roaming street gangs intimidating and terrorizing people, a high incidence of homicide, rape, arson and similar&nbsp; vicious crimes.&nbsp; Iâ€™m just not seeing that here, at least at the moment. <br />

					73/74 Street is a thriving commercial area -- centered around a major transit hub (one of the biggest and busiest in the City).&nbsp; The â€œmoney and business interestsâ€ here are mostly small, local merchants and entrepreneurs who are trying to make a living (and who may not have the option of a white collar job in Manhattan).&nbsp; To the extent their businesses are expanding, this will provide jobs and opportunity for people and help keep the neighborhood vital.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are numerous other parts of Jackson Heights, further away from the subway, that are entirely residential and are very tranquil, orderly and elegant -- which is one of the great things about the neighborhood.&nbsp; But Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s reasonable to expect that same level of peace and quiet in a building thatâ€™s smack in the middle of the commercial district. <br />

					In some ways, itâ€™s a little hard to assess how serious this problem is. I totally understand complaints about things like loud noise very late at night when people are trying to sleep and accumulated garbage.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, I donâ€™t see how holiday decorations -- however â€œtackyâ€ -- are a serious concern.&nbsp; Itâ€™s just part of the neighborhood mix. <br />Also -- being coughed on is obviously not pleasant but it is something that inevitably happens in a city like NY, whether in Jackson Heights or elsewhere.&nbsp; I pass along 73rd Street every so often and have never noticed a major problem -- but I guess if I was living there I might have a different view point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have to say, though, I donâ€™t see any real problem on 82nd Street, which is close to home and which I walk along every day&nbsp; (donâ€™t understand why 82nd Street would ever be considered a train wreck as someone said above).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					I also hated a lot of the of the subway graffiti back in the late 70s, mostly because it just seemed like an artless scrawl.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But Iâ€™ve usually liked the look of the 5 Pointz building -- itâ€™s colorful, interesting, joyful in a way.&nbsp; Something lively to see just before heading into the subway tunnel. <br />

					A board should always be free to implement and maintain rigorous financial requirements, given the financial interdependence of the cooperative structure -- so long as the rules are fairly and universally applied. <br /><br />Other than financial disqualifications, however, what are the legitimate reasons for turning someone down?&nbsp; <br /><br />Very few as far as I can see.&nbsp; If someone lies on or falsifies their application or if further investigation shows they have an atrocious behavior record at prior residences -- yes those would be good turn down reasons, but I think thatâ€™s relatively rare (particularly among people who are responsible enough to meet financial threshold -- i.e. steady employment, good credit history).<br /><br />So why are financially qualified people sometimes rejected? <br /><br />Iâ€™ve never been turned down by a co-op, but Iâ€™ve had friends/colleagues who have been -- financially qualified, responsible people who were inexplicably rejected after the board interview.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is at least an argument that everyone is entitled to at least some kind of explanation -- particularly given the extensive effort and expense that goes into an apartment purchase (by the buyer, the seller, the realtor, the bank providing the financing, attorneys for all parties etc.) only to have the whole deal KOd at the last moment by an (apparently) capricious or in some cases discriminatory decision by the board. <br /><br />While I do have mixed feelings about this bill, it does have the positive effect of promoting greater transparency -- <br />

					3 hours of legal time by the co-op lawyer is high.&nbsp; Review of refinancing by co-op lawyer is required to ensure the cooperative&#039;s interests are protected -- but this should mostly involve just a review of the recongnition agreement (a/k/a Aztec agreement)&nbsp; which is usually in a fairly standard form.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it would be entirely reasonable to ask why such an apparently extensive legal review is requried.<br /><br />Note that sometimes the co-op&#039;s management company (as opposed to the lawyer) will also charge an administrative fee for the time it takes to comply with requests for information from the lending bank, but this should not be more than a couple hundred dollars. <br /><br /><br /><br />

					Just to point out, based on the limited information contained in the Times article, it is not clear that the land sale decision made at the school in Manhattan in 1991 or the subsequent decision to merge with another school were necessarily â€œmistakes.â€&nbsp; The land sale and the merger decision could have been the most viable (or indeed the only viable) options for the school at that time -- particularly given the financial pressures which seem to have been impacting other similarly situated schools. We just don&#039;t know -- <br /><br />I think itâ€™s maybe a little a bit facile to second guess these decisions from some 20 years back (partciualrly based on one news article) or suggest that this somehow shows a suspect â€œpattern of behaviorâ€ by the headmaster involved&nbsp; (after all, the decisions were presumably ultimately made by a board with&nbsp; fiduciary obligation to the school).<br /><br />That said, I certainly hope that the school/community/City find some way to make this happenâ€¦ <br />

					I am a happy co-op owner and there are certainly many advantages to ownership.&nbsp; But for someone with short term horizons, I have to agree renting is probably the best bet.<br />&nbsp; <br />Based on a standard amortization schedule for a thirty year mortgage, the vast majority of the monthly mortgage payment will go to debt service for the initial 3-4 years of ownership -- very little to paying down principal. So your monthly payments really are not a meaningful financial investment in the future until you are a good ten-fifteen years into the process.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for appreciation, while no one knows for sure, I think itâ€™s unlikely that weâ€™ll see substantial appreciation in property values over the next several years. There was a very dramatic escalation in JH real estate prices a few years back -- but I think much more modest value increases are likely to be the norm for the next few years (and there is at least a possibility of a decline, depending on how the national and local economy does over the next couple of years).&nbsp; <br /><br />Add to that the substantial transaction costs associated with both buying and selling -- as well as the fact that when you are at a point in your personal life when you are ready to sell and move on, you will nonetheless have to continue making mortgage and maintenance payments on the property until you find a buyer (which could take some time). <br />

					Itâ€™s not only diverse but incredibly convenient.&nbsp; Within a five minute walk from my apartment I have ready access to:&nbsp; a 24 hours supermarket (decent selection of food);&nbsp; a 24 hour drug store and pharmacy; a good&nbsp; hardware store; an OK&nbsp; florist/plant store; a decent bagel place; a decent Pizza place; several furniture stores;&nbsp; and, of course, a wide range of culinary options ranging from fast food/take out (Pan Fino, Seba Seba) to relatively upscale (La Cabana, Uncle Peters).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Going a bit further afield, there is a plethora of clothing stores, shoe stores, florists, electronic stores, discount stores, hair salons, hard ware stores, check cashing places, nail salons, dental and medical offices, a huge abundance of bars and restaurants and various other businesses, along Roosevelt Ave. and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Many if not all of these businesses seem to be flourishing.&nbsp; So itâ€™s definitely not BS to say that there is a strong market for the business mix we have now.<br /><br />More options are always welcome -- but, at least from my perspective, we already have a lot.&nbsp; <br />

					For a lot of people in JH and surrounds, the current mix of businesses -- weighed toward discount stores, fabric stores, etc. -- definitely seems to serve an important need.&nbsp; Roosevelt and 37th&nbsp; are always packed with shoppers particularly on weekends.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am happy to see boutique type stores as well, but they can be a little overpriced -- and I think the market for this kind of business in JH is probably limited.&nbsp; Anyway for me, keeping the neighborhood vibrant and bustling with lots of people is much more important than changing the mix of businesses -&nbsp; <br />

					It is a shame -- but unfortunately Monserrateâ€™s conduct is not that uncommon.&nbsp; Casual corruption of this sort seems to be a deeply entrenched part of local politics in New York and New Jersey (and of course various other places around the country) dating back to at least the late 19th century.&nbsp; Periodically there will be a waves of scandals and headlines followed by prosecution and punishment of selected officials, but Iâ€™m not sure that there has ever been a meaningful, lasting reform of the system --&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, there are also honest, dedicated people who enter public service and who make a commendable effort to advance the common good (I just wish there were a few more of them).
