					Moved into our small co-op 6 years ago (one of the neighborhood originals), and for the first three, barely heard a thing from the folks upstairs.&nbsp; Then they had a kid.&nbsp; It slowed down the parents a bit, as they now walk about flat footed, but it&#039;s their child who is always running and stomping about.&nbsp; It&#039;s enough that the hanging lights shake at times.<br /><br />So I get that part of the deal of co-op living is dealing with noise, so for a while we never said anything until one day&nbsp; there was so much banging around that folks on the other end of my zoom meeting asked about it.&nbsp; So I sent an email.&nbsp; The response was that they had carpets in every room and they would try to tamp down on the running.&nbsp; If anything, the running and stomping has increased.&nbsp; It&#039;s my impression that they do not think their little girl can make that much noise.<br /><br />So I wanted to ask the forum, as I imagine some might be in either position while living in century old housing stock, what is a reasonable course here?&nbsp; How much can you push for someone to get better carpet/padding, how often can you hector them?&nbsp; Since the first email conversation generated zero results, what&#039;s the neighborly next step?&nbsp; They are nice folks and we have always gotten along.&nbsp; I have some sympathy too, as it seems like she runs them stupid, so no one is asking for perfection or silence, but the banging around is getting ridiculous.<br /><br />Or am I wrong in asking at all?&nbsp; It is just part of the deal that if someone has a kid, the people below them earn a dozen years of constant banging round?

					Spanish Gardens has been renovating units after renters move out and have been throwing out window panes.&nbsp; I grabbed five of them, one of which I used and one of which my friend used.&nbsp; I have three which anyone can come and take for free.<br /><br />The windows are 6 pane, old style looking, roughly 34&quot; x 28&quot; in size.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they are 1920&#039;s originals, but they certainly don&#039;t look like anything recently produced. The wood is in relatively good condition, a bit flaky in some areas, and all of the glass is intact (each pane is about 9&quot;x13&quot; and is separated by about an inch of wood).&nbsp; They have a brown paint on the exterior side and a white on the interior.&nbsp; I wiped them down with alcohol so there are no issues of critters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen these things run for about $25 at reclaim/junk shops and are good for any number of DIY projects.&nbsp; They are free for the taking. They aren&#039;t light, but certainly can be handled by a single person.&nbsp;

					Some love for Appettito off 79th!&nbsp; Been going there off and on for a bit now and never disappointed.&nbsp; Got myself some time out of purgatory for making my wife a brunch with the German Ham, Danish Bacon (cut it as thick as you like!), Russian cheese and an awesome sweet which looks alot like rugelach I bought from them.&nbsp; A wonderful part of the neighborhood.

					It seems pretty generous to give Nevius much credit about the decline of green space.&nbsp; He pretty much ignores it, just once (semi-incorrectly) mentioning the loss of the golf course.&nbsp; He never mentions the loss of the tennis courts, green spaces along the avenue or the shortage of parks.&nbsp; Instead he spends time making awkward observations about the private gardens, which lends itself to his primary focus of racism and classism.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with Lmaniace&#039;s assessment, though I&#039;ll give mixed credit on the history aspect:&nbsp; He got many details correct, but he often applied them unevenly and without context.&nbsp; Same can be said for his urban planning analysis.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with Lalochezia as well.&nbsp; Some of his tenets were laughable.<br />

					I remember that you posted a similar concern about your building about a year ago.&nbsp; Have you taken any direct action since?&nbsp; As others have noted, there absolutely is a set in stone guideline: Your co-op by-laws.&nbsp; Was the election of the board or its subsequent actions in violation of your by-laws?&nbsp; If no, then your only recourse is to persuade the majority of shareholders to align with your interests.&nbsp; Co-ops are one of the last gasps of direct democracy left around here, a very cool privilege, but it bears the responsibility of being gracious if the majority tacks against your priorities.<br /><br />If I can practically figure out the building you live in, then your fellow shareholders certainly can, so it might be best to try and work these things out discretely rather than airing them out here.&nbsp; Good luck with everything though!

					Even though today I saw a BMW jackass cut the traffic line by zipping along the bike lane on 80th Street by the expressway, the bicyclist in me still likes bike lanes even if unprotected.&nbsp; It seems bicyclists are invisible to some drivers and bike lanes are reminders that we do exist and have full rights to the road.<br /><br />If I make it to 82, I&#039;d hope that I&#039;d have the wherewithal to engage in participatory democracy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what will be considered politically correct in 4 decades.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if today&#039;s fine will be tomorrow&#039;s frightful.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll be sharp enough to pilot those shoals.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know Mrs. Darby, but from what I read, she&#039;s not much worse a racist than the average person and doesn&#039;t seem to be coming from a place of hate.&nbsp; Probably a nice enough person and her backstory hints that back when she was my age or so, she just might have even been considered a progressive.&nbsp; For three decades she&#039;s served her city. What she said in the papers is utterly unacceptable and it was definitely her time to go.&nbsp; Maybe that should have happened 10 years ago.&nbsp; Still, I&#039;d hesitate before calling her a clown: At 82, any one of us can very easily be Ms. Darby.
