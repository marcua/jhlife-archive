					Took a walk through the neighborhood in New Year&#039;s Day--34th Avenue not too busy, then down to Diversity Plaza which gets dirtier and uglier--from the shanties that were set up by a few restaurants to having more trash receptacles than trees.&nbsp; Then approaching Roosevelt Avenue is a bird-poop laden sidewalk.&nbsp; Some of our community leaders hailed Diversity Plaza as a nice space for our neighborhood--and are now pushing for Open Streets on 34th Avenue.&nbsp; Would be great to have funds to keep Diversity Plaza clean--it is one of the main entries into our neighborhood.&nbsp; There are congested areas in Manhattan and elsewhere that can keep open spaces clean and welcoming. Any thoughts on how this area can be improved.

					After my latest bad experience with Tomo sushi delivery, was hoping to hear if there are better options in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; In my opinion Tomo was better than Okawa, but this last delivery the sushi was almost inedible, chicken katsu was limp, and to top it off had a staple in the white rice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last week went to Watawa on Ditmars where the sushi is so fresh and delicious.&nbsp; There are so many good sushi places in Astoria, you think we can demand better quality and variety in JH.&nbsp; I can&#039;t eat Thai, Nepalese and Mexican all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any recommendations on quality sushi...that delivers.

					I recently was ticketed for car that was just touching the white line of a crosswalk on a street off of 35th Avenue. A few days later I noticed another car similarly was ticketed.&nbsp; In both cases the car was completely clear of the &quot;crosswalk&quot;. <br /><br />When is a crosswalk a crosswalk...then I noticed that the crosswalks on many streets in JH are extra wide (as compared to other neighborhoods) and are painted to extend well past the line of the building and the area of sidewalk for actually crossing the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact in this case the new line was about 1 1/2 feet wider than the previous line painted on the street.<br /><br />I know this is revenue generation for the city and traffic cops, but there should be some standards on the area for cross-walks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Appealed this and filing a complaint with the DOT.&nbsp; Plus, there is so much that these cops should be policing that are actually causing traffic problems...double parking, intersection u-turns, incessant honking, parking really close to fire hydrants...

					What is with all the work replacing underground pipelines in the neighborhood both on 37th Ave and 35th Ave--how much longer is all the work going to take.&nbsp; Work was by 84th Street this morning--and now I smell a foul odor wafting into my apartment that&#039;s giving me a headache and itchy eyes.&nbsp; It seems like National Grid or Coned is replacing something every year in the same spot.<br />

					Apparently there are some people who still refuse to clean up after their dogs.&nbsp; I confronted an elderly Latino man who let his dog crap right in front of my building--but denied it and lied about having a bag to pick up.&nbsp; I thought public shame might help--but I noticed he continues to walk his dog without a bag.&nbsp; I noticed more buildings putting up signs (in English) -- but probably more communication to the community on the need to pick up after dogs, the violations, and the risk to public health.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, maybe we can post pictures of the offenders.&nbsp; I love dogs. You wanna dog in the city--clean up after it.

					Wow, another greasy chicken spot seems to be opening....Kennedy Fried Chicken on 37th Avenue near 82nd Street.&nbsp; In addition to banning large sodas, maybe the city should consider limiting the number of crap eateries that can open on one city block.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not much new in the way of good eating options in JH.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s why there seems to be so much obesity around these streets.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Lately I noticed a lot more Fresh Direct trucks delivering in Jackson Heights. Not sure why...maybe as the hood continues to change, or Fresh Direct has been more aggressive promoting to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Always thought of trying, but I like to go to the market and choose my food.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, been annoyed by their business model...blocking streets and especially idling their trucks with their noisy refrigeration motors.&nbsp; This morning a truck sat outside my window for 15 minutes at 8 am.&nbsp; The NYC law is not to idle for more than 3 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I get dinners delivered at times, but are people that lazy that they can&#039;t go to the supermarket themselves?

					Interesting article about banning post cards for prostitutes (Chica Chica) on Roosevelt Avenue in NY Daily News.&nbsp; While they are at it, can they also do something about all the post cards and flyers left on cars in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Thought that was already illegal.<br /><br /><br />ALBANY - They&#039;re called &quot;Chica Chica&quot; cards - and they&#039;re flooding Corona and Jackson Heights, Queens.<br /><br />They look like baseball cards. But instead of featuring A-Rod or Derek Jeter, they have graphic pictures of naked or half-naked women - with a phone number offering free delivery.<br /><br />They&#039;re really the business cards of prostitutes and pimps who operate along a stretch of Roosevelt Ave. in Queens - and a move is afoot to make them illegal.<br /><br />Queens Democratic Sen. Jose Peralta wants to make it a crime to distribute the raunchy cards. He and his Assembly counterpart Francisco Moyo have introduced a bill making distribution of the cards a misdemeanor, categorizing them as obscene material.<br /><br />&quot;Is this going to eliminate prostitution? It&#039;s not,&quot; Peralta said. &quot;It&#039;s the first step toward improving the quality of life on Roosevelt Ave.&quot;<br /><br />The lawmakers say that on a nighttime walk down Roosevelt Ave., there will be men uttering the words, &quot;chicas, chicas,&quot; which means &quot;girls, girls&quot; - and they&#039;ll thrust forward one of the cards.<br /><br />Residents are fed up.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s infuriating,&quot; said Nuala O&#039;Doherty, a 42-year-old mother of three who lives near Roosevelt Ave. &quot;They&#039;re all over the streets in the morning. You can&#039;t get rid of them.&quot;<br /><br />The cards have led to some awkward questions from her three young kids.<br /><br />&quot;The kids pick them up,&quot; said O&#039;Doherty. &quot;They&#039;ll ask, &#039;Mommy, what are the cards for? Why are the women standing like that? Why do they have no clothes?&#039;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t have good answers.&quot;<br /><br />O&#039;Doherty said her husband called the number on one of the cards and was asked all sorts of questions in Spanish about what kind of woman he wants.<br /><br />&quot;They&#039;ll come to you,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#039;ll bring the girl to you so they don&#039;t have to pay for a room.&quot;<br /><br />Queens District Attorney Richard Brown calls the &quot;Chica&quot; cards &quot;a vexing problem that is plaguing our communities.&quot;<br /><br />But he said a law to ban them raises &quot;difficult legal questions under the court&#039;s interpretation of the First Amendment.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/27/2011-03-27_xxxcard_rage_qns_nabes_fight_flood_of_tawdry_chica_chica_ads_for_hookers.html#ixzz1HnxA2KFl" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/27/2011-03-27_xxxcard_rage_qns_nabes_fight_flood_of_tawdry_chica_chica_ads_for_hookers.html#ixzz1HnxA2KFl</a>

					Hate to lodge any more complaints in regarding the City&#039;s big screw up clearing the snow, but is there any reason why over 3 days after the storm and with the street (35th Ave) clear that the MTA still is not running the Q49 bus on its regular schedule.&nbsp; While most complaints have been about Sanitation Dept. response, the MTA seems equally inept.&nbsp; Given that today they raised the price of a ride, maybe someone there can give an update on bus service.&nbsp; I am fit to walk to Roosevelt (or ready to get back in the car), but there are lots of elderly that would find it difficult to navigate all the slush.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:tickedoff:

					Just had the buffet at the new Tawa Tandoor on 74th Street.&nbsp; It was definitely one of the best buffets in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; All the dishes were very tasty and fresh--good variety.&nbsp; Service was pleasant, as well as the decor...I prefer it to Jackson Diner (I think the quality has gone downhill), although they don&#039;t have the Masala Dosa.&nbsp; Tawa Tandoor and Delhi Heights are my favorites by far. Haven&#039;t yet tried the buffet at Mehfil which I know is a favorite on this site.
