					Back from JH, at long last! We went yesterday afternoon and spent a while wandering around, and even spent some time talking to a realtor. After having only spent time on and near 74th St for Indian food and groceries, it was really interesting to see the whole neighborhood. A few thoughts:<br /><br />1) The diversity is truly unbelievable. I always like to tell people that living in NYC is like living in Epcot Center, but if that&#039;s true, JH is the core. Just incredible. Just one vignette: Columbian woman with stroller talking to an old Greek guy while an Indian man walks past and an old Jewish couple comes up from the rear. And we saw openly gay couples holding hands! Wow. Fantastic to see, and I really didn&#039;t sense any tension at all. It seems that one end of the &#039;hood is more Indian and another part is more Latin American, etc., but it&#039;s still remarkable.<br /><br />2) We were surprised at how much business was there. Yeah, lots of stores sell cheap clothes or what have you, but this tells me that the community is thriving and shopping within its own boundaries. Plus, there were certainly plenty of the stores we would need, even if the neighborhood still lacks a bookstore (my only negative, shopping-wise). To see stores stretch all the way down 37th, as well as far up 82nd, is great. And bonus points for the killer Buster Brown sign on a shoestore!<br /><br />3) The housing stock seems to vary, which is probably the result of a neighborhood in some transition, and certainly a result of what I imagine are older folks who&#039;ve lived there for decades. It was a shame to see a string of English townhouses and half of them be a little run down. I&#039;m sure that sometimes when you&#039;re 70 or something, keeping up appearances isn&#039;t so top priority. We also noticed some drastic differences in the apartment buildings. You can certainly tell on a glance what&#039;s a co-op and what&#039;s rentals (but I suppose that&#039;s true anywhere). On the initial route we took up 82nd and to 86th via 34th, there were some places falling apart. Then later, after speaking with the realtor, we headed up 80th and strolled down the upper 70s on 34th and saw a different story.<br /><br />4) Not a ton of foot traffic outside of 37th, and no one in the gardens, enjoying them, at the Chateau or the Towers. But then, it was a Friday afternoon. Might be different on a weekend. We&#039;ll see. We hope to come back and see some open houses at some point soon.<br /><br />5) On a related note, are there any parks or playgrounds outside of the one where there&#039;s a farmer&#039;s market? I know the colossal Flushing Meadows is nearby, but I&#039;m curious.<br /><br />6) Further to eating, are there many supermarkets? We walked nearly the length of 37th and didn&#039;t see one. There&#039;s always Fresh Direct, but... There&#039;s gotta be supermarkets. I guess we just didn&#039;t see them?<br /><br />7) A final one! How&#039;s the neighborhood for kids? Schools? Recreation and socializing?<br /><br />Many thanks to those of you on this board. Everyone being so helpful just goes to show me how many folks are really invested in their neighborhood, which is great!<br /><br />

					Still haven&#039;t come by yet! The husband and I have dueling work-at-home schedules. Perhaps tomorrow or Weds. I need an Indian food fix on top of it!<br /><br />Your mention of Williamsburg is interesting, because I lived in Greenpoint at Bedford and Manhattan Aves for 11 years. From what other folks are saying, it sounds as though the historic neighborhood is kind of like the beauty of some of Brooklyn&#039;s high-end neighborhoods, combined with a perimeter of grit not unlike Wburg and Greenpoint. Manhattan Ave had 99 cent stores to spare, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />This may work fine for us. We&#039;re basically homebodies -- thus the desire for a lovely old apartment -- and when we want to eat out, we want authentic ethnic stuff, not restaurants along the lines of Smith Street. Smith Street is fine, but we could really take it or leave it. This should be interesting!

					That&#039;s interesting on the prices. I&#039;d love to hear any other comps folks might have. <br /><br />Judging by what&#039;s in the NY Times and on the market on the MPC Properties site, the most expensive apt being advertised at the moment is a 670K 4BR in The Towers. From there it drops to 600 for a 4BR in The Chateau, 540K for a 3BR in The Fillmore, 510K for an estate 4BR in The Chateau... Lots of these apts keep getting relisted as well, and have seen price cuts. They seem to have been sitting for half a year or more in most cases. But it may be because they&#039;ve got problems of some other sort...

					This is all fantastic info. Thanks everyone! We may head over tomorrow if the weather holds.<br /><br />I think that if we choose to go with JH, we&#039;ll probably look to buy among those famed garden buildings in the 80s between 34th adn 35th. Might as well live it up! But we also want to see where we&#039;ll be going to the dry cleaner&#039;s and the drug store and etc -- local business. And finally, where we&#039;ll be getting on and off the train. I&#039;m very familiar with the 74th and Roosevelt station, but it&#039;ll be interesting to see where the neighborhood starts to get grittier by the 82nd St stop. Looks like all your comments cover this.<br /><br />Again, thanks!

					We actually were thinking of coming Sunday, so we&#039;ll go by the farmer&#039;s market for sure!<br /><br />While we&#039;re at it, if anyone reads this that recently moved to JH from Brooklyn or what have you, I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts on your new &#039;hood, warts and all. Every neighborhood has pluses and minuses -- we&#039;re very focused on having a comfortable home that&#039;s 3 or 4BR, and JH has us there. What about the rest? (Aside from the incredible food, which will probably make me as big as a house! Ha.)

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />My husband and I are looking to buy in the next year, and since we don&#039;t have over a million dollars &lt;cough&gt; to spend on a nice pre-war apt in Brooklyn Heights like the one we&#039;re renting, we&#039;ve taken a big interest in Jackson Heights. We&#039;re familiar with a few restaurants we love, but not with the deeper neighborhood.<br /><br />Since maybe one of these days it won&#039;t rain, we plan on coming and strolling around. What streets should we hit? We want to live in the historic district -- we&#039;re big on architecture and old buildings. Can you folks tell us a few streets and blocks to go through? What street is the &quot;main drag,&quot; meaning the place with all the local businesses? Is this 35th Ave? 37th? We don&#039;t need a step-by-step walking tour, but would love to hear suggestions on places to check out to get a feel for what it would be like living there.<br /><br />I presume we&#039;d get off the 7 at 82nd St, and then... ?<br /><br />Thanks!
