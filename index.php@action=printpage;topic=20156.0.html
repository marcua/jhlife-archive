				I know people have felt locked up for months, and need a release valve, and restaurants need to do what they can to entice customers and business, but I&#039;m just going to put this out there...&nbsp; The LOUD Amplified music on 37th ave every Friday/Saturday night is driving me CRAZY.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />

				isn&#039;t it theoretically supposed to end at 10? either way, i sympathize. i know that aggravation from previous apartments. perhaps the cooler weather will make a difference.

				Not to mention, blasting music in front of a restaurant (as I saw in front of Armondo&#039;s last night) means all those unmasked diners have to raise their voices to carry on a conversation--amping up the risk of transmission.

				Don&#039;t know if they meant Romeo&#039;s... but walking past there is such a disaster. I said to my husband we should go to eat there one evening... you know, a nice, calm Italian dinner. But when we walked by it was just so loud it really turned me off. Would not want to dine there with all the noise.

				What is god&#039;s name has been going on lately?&nbsp; It&#039;s been the last couple weeks max.&nbsp; We&#039;re on 88th btw 37th and 35th (luckily closer to 35) and it just sounds like a car with a huge subwoofer is parked outside for hours on end.

There has to be! 5am is OUTRAGEOUS (or did you mean 5pm...either way, not cool). Do you know for sure it is a restaurant or is it people partying? If you know what restaurant it is, I would also put the blitz on them...call/tweet/report. And encourage neighbors to do the same. Unfortunately, being the squeaky wheel is sometimes the only way to get things done.

				The 5:15 AM (not PM!) could have, in fairness, been a parked car or a party or something else, but the sound profile was the same as when it goes on for hours.&nbsp; Same direction, same amount of bass, not moving (like a car), so I made some assumptions. Generally when we hear it it&#039;s when we least want to go and explore (asleep/in pajamas/in for the evening) but I guess we may have to instead of being lazy and just raging about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was no way in hell I was heading out half-asleep after being awakened at 5 am though, and whoever was doing it probably was not going to receptive anyway.&nbsp; I mean, it takes a certain personality/mind-state to start blasting shit at that hour and I don&#039;t have the body/energy to back up my anger anymore if someone wanted to fight about it&nbsp; ;)

				New York is incredibly loud.

You get my drift.<br /><br />I have a pair of good earplugs next to my bed.<br /><br />They have turned out to be the best $5 I ever spent since I bought them years ago when I lived near a bar in party-town Brooklyn. <br /><br />
