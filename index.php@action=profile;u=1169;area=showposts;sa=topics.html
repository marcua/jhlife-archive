					Thanks for the thread about the tipping protocol for building supers and others. That&#039;s what I love about this online community, which mimics something organic and old-time. You could live here for a hundred years and still not know anyone. Online here, more questions are raised and answered than I&#039;d ever have time to think of myself, so thanks for that. That tipping thread is only an example.&nbsp; So, thanks for all that...<br /><br />Now, what I&#039;m curious about are the grocery workers, especially at Trade Fair.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the situation is? Is it just that the management there allows them to ask for tips (I don&#039;t see this at the Met, for example) and before I make any assumptions I&#039;m seeking some information/assistance in seeking information about what the deal is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still have a recurring dream about working for 3.25 an hour as a grocery store bagger when I was in high school (and until I was 18 when as a cashier I could make more than the 3.75 an hour ceiling for baggers). My students are shocked to hear how much I made from age 15-18 (1983-85). Once I turned 18 about three years later, I was promoted to cashier (and immediately quit, since freedom to wander off, collect carts, do carry-outs, etc., was a perk work preserving when compared to the responsibilities of being a cashier). My students are shocked but the truth is that 3.50 or so per hour back then was more in real dollars than 7 and change is now. For example, fuel was under a dollar a gallon, for just one misleading indicator.<br /><br />Back to the Trade Fair workers.&nbsp; I read somewhere about a suit filed on behalf of workers at a Brooklyn grocery store for some situation where they were not being properly compensated -- Does anyone know what I&#039;m talking about?&nbsp; I don&#039;t assume that this is the case here, but that&#039;s why I&#039;d like to know what others here know about this...&nbsp; <br /><br />Generally, it&#039;s my policy to tip well and tip often, especially pizza workers, baristas, and others whose incomes need community supplement since I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s difficult as a small business owner to pay what is proper and fair--I&#039;m not apologizing for them but rather for the market-based system, which I loathe. <br /><br />Any thoughts?&nbsp; I know what the Living Wage is, so once I get some proper information I may come back around with something about that... But first, as Tony T says, &quot;just the facts.&quot; Well, if you have some facts, please share...<br /><br />

					Does anyone know what was up last evening down by 87th Street/37th Ave? <br /><br />In honor of my people back in Hamtramck, I went down to the new Polish deli (recently described in a food/restraurant thread on this site), and the lights on that block were out. Before I went in to find the worried owners sitting there in the dark, there was a tremendous booming sound, which seemed like an explosion but was described a few minutes later as a truck falling over (?). Inside the restaurant, and while they scooped up from stuffed cabbage and rice for me in total darkness, they described being able to hear the fire under their feet and other loud &quot;explosions.&quot;<br /><br />When I left, I peeked down 87 and the street was filled with thick smoke. Con Ed trucks were everywhere, mixed in with NYPD and NYFD trucks.<br /><br />I heard a helicopter overhead later, but was never verified if that was an emergency services aircraft or news.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two thumbs up on the good food. I promise to go back in the light.

					December 4, 2009, Jackson Heights, New york: <br /><br />In an exciting turn of events, a bizarre giant invasive species of enormous plastic flowers has landed in Jackson Heights, a district with a unique history of promoting vibrant primary colors, creative use of petroleum-based public sculpture, and an emphasis on flash and wit over the cool and downbeat. These flowers have appeared in the courtyard behind the Community Methodist Church at 81st and 35th Ave and are available for public viewing 24/7. <br /><br />Here is a picture:<br /><br /><img src="http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3655/alienflowers.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" />

					I have some essentially new clothes that don&#039;t fit me and want to donate them to either a local charity organization or a second hand retailer worthy of support. I&#039;m more interested in supporting local businesses and concerns than seeing good stuff turn into fodder for corporate infrastructure as with Salvation Army or whatnot.&nbsp; Any advice or preferences?&nbsp; In the past I&#039;ve worn things until no one would want them but as I said I have some quality clothes that don&#039;t quite fit, including shoes, pants and shirts.

					I read somewhere that John Liu&#039;s campaign was going to be fined for its illegal postering during the election season, and that it&#039;s a per-offense penalty. I can&#039;t find the article now and yet that&#039;s not why I&#039;m writing here.<br /><br />I noticed postering on the poles on 79th &amp; 37th Ave -- &quot;Donate your Car&quot; it reads -- apparently a non-profit. While I&#039;ve called 311 about that, and you might too (if it bothers you; I was mostly calling to find out the rule but did, in fact complain), I also asked about the postering on cars.&nbsp; This has come up here before, with, I think, the general consensus that this fell to the 115th Precinct and that they really don&#039;t care about this.<br /><br />So... I don&#039;t blame them.<br /><br />However, I did call Innovative Vision Care and suggest that they run around and pick up the flyers that were distributed overnight on every car in the neighborhood. I notified them of the law. Their number is 718-424-5500.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not get them in trouble, so I didn&#039;t file a complain and the nice woman who answered the phone was unaware of the law and that the penalty for it was per-instance.... (You&#039;ll note that John Liu&#039;s fine--if actually handed down--would amount to well into 6 figures)...<br /><br />Anyhow, give them a call and encourage them, as I did, to send an employee out, on this beautiful Autumn day, to pick up all that trash.<br /><br />If this is something that bothers you, lets run a little blacklist here. If you like it, and appreciate the advertising, call them to let them know that, too, and perhaps you might take some business there.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

					I&#039;ve been following the race for the City Council seat currently occupied by Helen Sears since late last year. <br /><br />Currently, the candidates in the Democratic Party Primary election are Danny Dromm, Stanley Kalathara, and Helen Sears, the incumbent. <br /><br />I hope we can get some conversation going about the merits of each candidate and who should represent Jackson Heights and the 25th Council District. Since the Primary is on September 15, it seems like the chances for meaningful dialogue are fast disappearing and Jackson Heights Life is the best place for a web-based forum. So, I&#039;d like to propose that we use the Jackson Heights Life forum, and this thread in particular, to work-out some community-based questions for the candidates. After generating a list of questions, we could pick the best and refine them for submission to each camp--who would be invited to respond directly here or through an intermediary of their choice. <br /><br />There is often ad hominem attack and &quot;red herrings&quot; where there might be basic information and reasoned debate. Before we can debate, however, I think we need some information from the candidates. <br /><br />There have been a lot of issues raised on Jackson Heights Life that are, in effect, campaign issues. These include but are not limited to: trash, the vendor question, parks/greenspace, safety/crime, transportation/traffic, schools, health care, and the development and sustainability of local business opportunities, among others. Sometimes these issues are raised here but the corresponding sense of it as an election-cycle issue is not well developed and the matter is dropped just when it might&nbsp; become productive to &quot;do something&quot; about it--Jeffsayyes&#039;s photography of the trash problem is a good example of what we might do as a start. It may be that that&#039;s the nature of the &quot;web forum&quot; as opposed to a more representative-journalistic function, in which members of the community do the developmental research and report back to the community in general (it&#039;s this model that I&#039;ll propose for JH at a later date). <br /><br />We might post a series of questions here, and then, either by consensus or committee, act to refine the questions and pose them in a neutral/non-partisan way to each candidate, whether in an &quot;interview&quot; format or in written form. These interviews could be typed verbatim or presented uncut in audio or video. It might be that each camp would rather respond to written prompts, and in many ways that&#039;s easiest and gives them control over the message. <br /><br />Please help by brainstorming some questions for the candidates.&nbsp; What questions do you have for them? If we have more than a few, we can refine/narrow them later, and I&#039;m happy to meet in person with other interested folks if there is interest.
