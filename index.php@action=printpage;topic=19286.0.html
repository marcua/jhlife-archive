				I was going thru my old posts on this board, and&nbsp; I&nbsp; first asked about a bathroom reno in 2012... ::)<br />but I think next year I am going to do both kitchen and bath, and am about to get the ball rolling making sure I am good with the co-op board and making sure I have all my research done. <br /><br />In looking thru my kitchen options, my current kitchen setup has a small dishwasher and a large built-in microwave, I use neither with great regularity, especially the dishwasher which is basically useless. <br /><br />If I leave these items out in a kitchen renovation, will that negatively impact resale?

				A dishwasher has a great appeal esp in our neighborhood where not all bldgs allow them, so leaving it out will likely mean losing a sale perk. <br /><br />The microwave is also standard but if you want to get rid of the built-in one, there are other ways to accommodate a microwave, unlike a dishwasher.

				Glad this was helpful. I don&#039;t know what your criteria are but I have a Bosch dishwasher, and I&#039;m very happy with it. It&#039;s super economical from water use point of view, and very quiet. Good luck.

				Let me second the Bosch recommendation. They make great quality, super quiet dishwashers. And if you don&#039;t have a lot of space they have a model that&#039;s smaller than standard. It&#039;s perfect for a small kitchen. PC Richard may carry it.

				We renovated our kitchen last year about this time (I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s been almost a year) and after researching I wanted either a Bosch or Miele dishwasher (for the upper cutlery rack, upper spray arm, and quiet). I got a used panel-ready Miele on Craigslist for $125 and it works like a dream. If you&#039;re on a budget, you can get some great appliances on CL. That DW came from a luxury home in Bedford whose new buyer was replacing an almost new kitchen. Crazy but true.
