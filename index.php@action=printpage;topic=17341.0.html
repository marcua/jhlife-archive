				My mom lives in Woodside and one of her neighbors we evicted and left their 2 cats behind. They have been coming to my mom&#039;s door and she started feeding them and even put out a wooden box with blankets for them. Unfortunately she can&#039;t take them in because she already has dog and a very territorial cat. Now that winter is coming she really wants them indoors. Anyone know of any rescues or of anyone who could take them in?

				Wow that is so horrible. People don&#039;t deserve animals! Have the cats ever been around dogs before? I have a dog who was brought up with a cat -- he&#039;s boisterous though so it might not be a great fit, but I&#039;d really like to help out if I can.

				Yes, the people who left them had a big black lab. One of the cats, I believe the female is very sweet and loves to be around people. The other one is a male who is not neutered and is more of a loner. I&#039;m not sure if the female is fixed.&nbsp; We just hate to see them outside now that the weather is getting bad. My mom&#039;s cat is extremely territorial. I found him when he was a kitten and we believe he may have been feral. he attacks anything and everything and just very agressive. If you could help out or guide me to someone who can that would be great. and I agree some people should not own animals.

				You can contact Danni, she is with a rescue and trust worthy. I recommend giving her a donation if she takes the cats as they need to be seen by the vet. It is very hard to find cat rescue for adult cats - hardly any will take adults and they also will turn away kittens too - so Danni should get a donation if she takes them. <br /><br />Purrfect Pals, Inc.
