				Just a note to anyone who uses Spectrum internet - as per the Spectrum technican I spoke with last week, Spectrum has reduced the power for the internet signal that goes to the cable modem. As a result our internet service slowed down a bit. <br /><br />Also, heads up that we called for support and Spectrum charged us $50 for the visit!

				jh35:&nbsp; I also pay for 200 mb but get much less based on periodic Spectrum Internet Speed Tests.&nbsp; I contacted Spectrum who sent a technician (no $50 charge) who tested the modem with a device and the modem is receiving 200+ mb.&nbsp; The problem is my computer which is not receiving the 200+ mb and I don&#039;t know why.&nbsp; However, the speed that I&#039;m getting is sufficient since I don&#039;t use the computer to play games or download music or films.&nbsp; I have an second older computer and its getting the full amount of mb&#039;s that Spectrum is sending.&nbsp; In my situation, the problem is not Spectrum.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Are you using 2.4 GHz for your WiFi or 5 GHz? <br /><br />2.4 GHz WiFi performs very badly when many people are using 2.4 GHz near each other (e.g. dense apartment buildings) and you will probably get much faster speeds by using 5 GHz.

				The Truth About Faster Internet: It&#039;s Not Worth It<br />Wall Street Journal Aug. 20, 2019<br />https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/<br /><br />Americans are spending ever more for blazing internet speeds, on the promise that faster is better. Is that really the case?<br /><br />For most people, the answer is no.<br /><br />The Wall Street Journal studied the internet use of 53 of our journalists across the country, over a period of months, in coordination with researchers at Princeton University and the University of Chicago.<br /><br />Our panelists used only a fraction of their available bandwidth to watch streaming services including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube, even simultaneously. Quality didn’t improve much with higher speeds. Picture clarity was about the same. Videos didn’t launch quicker.<br /><br />Broadband providers such as Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc. and AT&amp;T Inc. are marketing speeds in the range of 250, 500 or even 1,000 megabits a second, often promising that streaming-video bingers will benefit. “Fast speeds for all of your shows,” declares one online ad from Comcast.<br /><br />But for a typical household, the benefits of paying for more than 100 megabits a second are marginal at best, according to the researchers. That means many households are paying a premium for services they don’t need.<br /><br />etc. <br />

				&nbsp;Some buildings here in JH have bought these long contracts with Spectrum which are lumped right<br />in with maintenance. It&#039;s a horror and you have no say in these situations which is an extra expense<br />for those not interested in any change with their connections and for those who want a different configuration for their networking.

				As I mentioned on October 23, although I was paying for 200mb, I was getting far less.&nbsp; &quot;r&quot; suggested that the problem could be using WiFi-2G instead of WiFi 5G.&nbsp; The Spectrum Technician was here this morning and switched me to 5G.&nbsp; Before he arrived, the download speed was 63.6.&nbsp; Its now 220.1&nbsp; <br /><br />

				That&#039;s exactly what happened in my case.

				Unfortunately, there aren&#039;t any more buildouts for FioS.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty much nationwide save for the areas where Verizon sold it off to FrontierNet (Florida for example.)&nbsp; So, the only way to get FioS in the neighborhood is to move into a new construction where it&#039;s been made available or hope that the phone wiring in your building is so bad they end up pulling in fiber with the pleasant side effect that FioS becomes available.&nbsp; Spectrum, with no competition, is free to do whatever they want.&nbsp;

If Verizon has been approved by your building but you have been waiting for construction for a long time, you could try making additional complaints via 311.

The building across the street from mine has had FIOS for years. <br /><br />My building is getting FIOS installed now because the building signed on, after renovating the halls. They could have signed on at any time during the past few years but did not want to since they were going through a co-op conversion. <br /><br />Complain to 311 and the FIOS people will contact the management of your building.
