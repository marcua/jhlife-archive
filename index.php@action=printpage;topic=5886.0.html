				This is a really good idea. Thanks for starting this thread, Native. Doing your part for the economy. Astorian&#039;s should follow suit.<br />The newer jobs end up farther and farther back, am I right? with the oldest at the top/front.<br />Would it be an improvement for jobs to have it&#039;s own category (maybe, maybe not). Each job posting would then have to be broken down into separate threads.<br />Are you just a good guy, or is this a business venture for you? are there any fees involved?
