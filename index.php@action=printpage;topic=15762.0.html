				I would bet the $600,000 price is for a 2 bedroom/1 bath........it&#039;s the only thing that makes sense.&nbsp; Probably just an error.

				Hi everyone and Happy Holidays!<br />Yes indeed third category from the top had a typo in it - it&#039;s the 2 bed 1 bath category. Freshly corrected!<br /><br />2017 will be an interesting year to monitor as we are coming into an enviroment of rising interest rates. We could see a rush of buyers hoping to beat the rise and lock into a low interst rate, or see a slowing due to the same. <br /><br />2016 benchmarks however are well planted. And if my gut is right, we should see an uptick in activity in the first quarter of 2017 for sure. <br /><br />

				WOW.&nbsp; We own a &#039;3&#039; bedroom 2 full bath co-op in the Greystones.&nbsp; The 3rd bedroom is the &#039;maids&#039; room and right off the kitchen but we use it as an office.&nbsp; <br />If I read the attachment correctly the price should be around 900K?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the Greystones have gone at that high a price...yet.

				$900k may seem like a lot until you look around and see that the housing prices have gone up all over the city.&nbsp; If you sold a place for $900k in JH and tried to buy similar apartment in another comparable neighborhood, you would quickly see the validity of what I am saying.&nbsp; <br />

Granted past year&#039;s numbers are averages, yet they provide a good matrix as to where the ESTIMATED value of your property today MAY fall. Ultimately price is decided by the market and a buyer&#039;s willingness to pay a price. <br /><br />It is important to keep in mind that Colonial Court had not seen a 2 bed 1 bath sale at 620k, Monroe did not see a 2 bed 1 bath sale at 600k nor did the Berkeley at 2 bed 2 bath sale at 750k. Yet those were our closing numbers. We closed several 1 bedroom sales north of 400k last year as well. So it is not to say a new record sale in the Greystones is not in the near future. <br /><br />Now in connection with your individual unit, it would be most important to clearly determine if your layout historically has traded as a 2 bedroom 2 bath with a &#039;maid&#039;s room, rather as a 3 bedroom, ( and I believe that is what the larger Greystone layouts are like ) which would comp it out BETWEEN the 2 bed 2 bath values and 3 bed 2 bath values. So depending on the quality of your finishes and provided it is a turn-key home, blind assessment would be between 775 and 825k.<br /><br />And to simply answer your question, yes, values have definitely been rising year to year since 2011 at a very steady pace. <br /><br />Happy 2017 everyone! <br />
