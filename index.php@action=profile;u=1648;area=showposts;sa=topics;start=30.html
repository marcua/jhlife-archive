					It has been the time to clean house ... thanks to the cold weather... and now you benefit<br /><br />I have had this Louis XV carved walnut armchair for about 15 years and never used it. I was purchased from Jack Lenor Larson&#039;s showroom by Schumacher in 1994 at a cost of $1,800... wholesale.&nbsp; (I have the paperwork)&nbsp; It was recovered by Schumacher... but I never liked the upholstery, so I tacked on more appropriate fabric.&nbsp; I have extra fabric if you want to recover in the green damask (which was also Schumacher fabric... I think there is enough).<br /><br />Anyway, I am only asking $400 (just think, no delivery charges, no tax... you just pick it up).&nbsp; The same chair would be at least $2,000 at ABC or Bloomingdale&#039;s, or other decorator showrooms (from whence it came)<br /><br />The chair is in great condition, beautifully and tastefully cared arms and legs... lovely wood.&nbsp; It measures 47&quot; high, 26&quot; wide and 27&quot; deep.&nbsp; <br /><br />My photos are too large to attach... so email me if you are interested and I will forward them to you.
