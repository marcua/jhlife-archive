			I suppose the anonymity factor is part of why the comments are so cutting and rude. Not that it excuses the rudeness.

			I&#039;m not a real curbed reader and was very disappointed in a lot of the comments. It makes me sad to know that there&#039;s so much classism and racism in the world. I&#039;m new to this neighborhood (from Astoria), and though it has it&#039;s problems, there is such a sense of community here that I think my husband and I made a good choice about where to live.

			Have to say the people are at their creative best when describing their &quot;love&quot; for JH. <br /><br />Here are some of my favs:<br /><br /><br />Jackson Heights? Gimme a fuckin break. i grew up in that shit hole, and am happier than ever that I am now out of there.<br /><br />Um, last time I checked, Jackson Heights was a shit bomb. And I last checked about 3 weeks ago.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS POLL??? IT&#039;S A GODDMAN NO-BRAINER!!!!<br /><br />The &quot;hsitoric disctrict&quot; in JH is NOT beautiful, by any realistic sense of the word!!!!. GET OVER IT ALREADY! JH IS A DUMP SLUM.<br /><br />Jackson Heights/Woodside -- best food (if you like cheap fast food garbage) in NYC.<br /><br />and last but not least, this one is the clincher:<br /><br />Crackson Heights FTW!<br /><br />&quot;Shit Bomb&quot; is my new favorite saying.<br /><br />:2funny:

When we first moved here we had a short timeline in mind, but have since thrown it out the window. We have no ambition to live anywhere else right now. Jackson Heights, by all accounts, was terrible 20 years ago. Now it is now a great neighborhood, and we see a lot of positive signs for the future as well.

			Regardless of what JH was in the past, or what it is now, we have to keep making it the best it can be.
