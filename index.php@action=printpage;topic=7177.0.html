				I am going to post this every few weeks, because I&#039;m not sure when the ideal time is. It&#039;s probably still too early!<br /><br />Just in case someone has relatives or friends who might be interested in coming for an extended stay I thought it was worth mentioning our sublet.<br /><br />I have a fellowship that will take us abroad for 8 months.<br /><br />We have a modest 1 bedroom coop -- i.e., no garden or granite counter tops! But it&#039;s convenient (81st and 37th) and quiet (faces the back of the building). We would be willing to give it for a reduced rent for someone who is responsible, known to someone in the neighborhood and who would be willing to keep an eye out for important mail. ($1100 or so, unless you need us to completely -- as opposed to partially -- empty it.)<br /><br />The apartment will be available from about May 23 to Jan 20. (Exact dates TBD -- but we will know for sure in about 6 weeks.)<br /><br />I will re-post closer to the time, of course. But I know I would&#039;ve jumped at something like this last year when my Dad was contemplating an extended visit from India, so I thought, why not put it out there now?<br />

				Hello<br /><br />My husband and I currently reside in Jackson Heights. Our current lease ends on April 30 and we have decided to purchase a home. We are looking for a short-term sublet/lease beginning in early May while we continue house hunting. We DO NOT smoke, have pets or children. We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about the apartment. <br /><br />Jadera
