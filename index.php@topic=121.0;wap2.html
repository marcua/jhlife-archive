			Shelby:<br /><br />Thanx for posting.<br /><br />Hope I can make his program and will then ask if he would bring this to the Jackson Heights Library.&nbsp; Nothing like ease in attending a program right around the corner.&nbsp; <br /><br />How I love convenience....<br /><br />Do you know who&#039;s in charge of the programs at the JHLibrary?<br /><br />Itty

			this is from the Library&#039;s website &quot;Luis Villalon, Chakrasambara Buddhist Center&quot;<br /><br />However, I think you would probably also need to speak with the person who coordinates events at the JH Library as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how these things work and whether there is a budget to pay the people who offer events (etc).&nbsp; <br />
