I have yet to hear that Senator Peralta has broken any laws nor have I heard that his office doesn&#039;t work. <br /><br />I do not see how bringing down an elected official, who represents a diverse district with broad views and experiences, who has done decent/good/excellent job in a system of dysfunction and corruption. <br /><br />In order for the Democrats to gain the majority, Democrats need to stop preaching to the choir, get out of our comfort zones and campaign in Republican districts, and have serious conversations with them. <br /><br />Drawing lines hasn&#039;t helped. Maybe some bridge building, and stop with the walls. <br /><br />Senator Parker who introduced the &quot;hostile&quot; amendment, did it for the optics, knowing he wasn&#039;t allowed to introduce such a bill due to procedures, his intention was to embarrass/shame IDC members, knowing there could be no vote, while understanding that the general public wouldn&#039;t understand what happened. <br /><br />Senator Parker stoked the flames, to upset people, people he currently can&#039;t help. <br /><br />What we the people need, is for Democrats to focus their attention on Republicans, not on Independent, Green, Libertarians, or the Independent Democratic Conference. <br /><br />Perhaps if I sound rude, it&#039;s because I&#039;m dismayed with government and community reaction. I prefer proaction, and a government that actually moves forward in the best interest of life on earth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

Just because Democrats know how to open a can of Chef Boyardee, doesn&#039;t make them chefs. <br /><br />You should be ashamed that our Democratic party prefers to spend time playing political games hurting all New Yorkers, and not actually getting work done. <br /><br />The March on Saturday, is to appease those who feel the need to do something, without actually investing time and money and traveling to areas where seats need to be flipped from Republican to Democrat.&nbsp; To actually have a majority, not living on a prayer majority.

No one is stopping you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Let&#039;s not confuse the readers ... 3 branches of government, only one can act alone and that&#039;s the Governor. If the governor wanted to fund public education as he pretends to be, then he should include the monies in the budget. <br /><br />The Senate, can&#039;t give money to local school districts, no matter how much Peralta wants to. Because the Senate is only 1 body out of 3 and that body needs the other two bodies to agree and sign bills/policies/funding into law. <br /><br />So while you want to make local residents believe that Peralta has the power of the pen and in one stroke he can get the monies owed, the truth is he can&#039;t and neither can any other sole legislator, except for the Governor. <br /><br />Flipping Peralta, isn&#039;t going to bring a majority to the NY Senate. And it&#039;s not going to make Felder vote for progressive legislation. It&#039;s not going to make Diaz vote for pro-choice policies. <br /><br />You want real power for the Democrats in the Senate, you need them to have a 10 member lead. You need to go to Nassau. You need to go upstate. You need to go to Staten Island. <br /><br />Attacking progressive Democrats for wanting to work across both aisles and get work done ... will NOT give us any form of progress. <br /><br />

					&quot;Politico NY: Senate Democrats explode over one-house resolutions<br />&nbsp;<br />By NICK NIEDZWIADEK<br />&nbsp;<br />ALBANY — Tension between the state Senate&#039;s Democratic factions exploded inside the chamber on Wednesday during a debate on a non-binding budget resolution.<br />&nbsp;<br />When the Senate took up a budget resolution sponsored by the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, mainline Democrats demanded that their resolution also receive a floor vote. That led Sen. Michael Gianaris, the mainline Democrats’ second in command, to attempt several parliamentary gambits to protest his conference’s inability to put forward its own measure. They failed.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sen. Jose Peralta of Queens, whose recent defection to the IDC led to an outcry from colleagues and constituents that other IDC members labeled as “racist,” said it was the first time that he was able to vote in favor of a one-house resolution, referring to the IDC resolution.<br />&nbsp;<br />“Everyone likes to talk about progressive issues,” he said. “A vote against this is a shame.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Freshman Sen. Marisol Alcantara of Washington Heights ratcheted up tensions by accusing Gianaris of exercising “white privilege.”<br />&nbsp;<br />In addition, she said she “would like to know how many times my colleague has been called the N-word or a spic.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Alcantara’s comments sparked multiple heated interjections from Gianaris and IDC leader Sen. Jeff Klein and forced Majority Leader John Flanagan to intervene to restore decorum.<br />&nbsp;<br />Klein defended Alcantara after the debate, saying she “takes her job, and her community and her heritage very seriously.”<br />&nbsp;<br />“This is the floor of the Senate where I think we’re supposed to be debating ideas, not personalities,” he said to reporters. “But at the end of the day, we did what we’re supposed to do, we put forth our legislative agenda.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Ultimately the IDC’s resolution drew support from only its eight members.<br />&nbsp;<br />“If there was ever any doubts who were the Republicans’ favored Democrats, this should put that to rest,” Gianaris said, speaking to reporters outside the Senate lobby.<br />&nbsp;<br />Gianaris, standing alongside the conference’s leader, Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, called the IDC’s resolution “Republican-light.”<br />&nbsp;<br />“The coalition obviously couldn’t agree on what to put in one resolution, so they allowed the IDC to put in their own resolution,” Stewart-Cousins said.<br />&nbsp;<br />Flanagan, speaking on the Senate floor, refuted accusations of opacity and exclusion by pointing to the joint budget hearings and calling it “a very public, lengthy, exhaustive process.”<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong><strong>The Republican resolution passed 32-28, with <em>Democratic Sen. Simcha Felder — who caucuses with the GOP — voting alongside the 31 Republicans.</em> <strong>Both Democratic conferences</strong> voted against it.&quot;</strong></strong></span><br /><br />The mainline Democratic Conference could have voted for a progressive One House bill by the Independent Democratic Conference but instead choose to have temper tantrums, not helping progressive values. And no matter what Simcha Felder gives majority power to the Republicans. The IDC is apparently trying to bridge the gaps between party ideologies.
