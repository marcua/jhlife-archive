				I&#039;m doing some research for a friend who&#039;s looking for a local swimming pool that offers either day passes or memberships.&nbsp; She&#039;s aware of the Long Island City YMCA and Flushing Meadows Corona Park Pool, but is still interested in other possible options.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, one of the hotels located near LaGuardia offered day passes for non-guests.&nbsp; Does anyone have more information on this?&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve heard about a pool at the Bulova Corporate Center in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; Googling didn&#039;t come up with much.&nbsp;

				If she wants just free swimming, you could consider Fisher Pool in East Elmhurst.<br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fisher-pool<br /><br />There&#039;s also a lap pool at Astoria Sports Complex.<br />http://ascsports1.com/<br /><br />I believe I saw a sign by the Holiday Inn Laguardia Airport 37-10 114th St Corona, NY 11368 that had something about day passes to the poll.<br /><br />Garden School has a pool too, that&#039;s open for summer camps. <br />

For instance, there are groups that do 10-12 and 1-3 on Sundays, I believe. The school also rents it out for birthday parties. It&#039;s not a day pass kind of thing, and the groups are all very child-heavy.
