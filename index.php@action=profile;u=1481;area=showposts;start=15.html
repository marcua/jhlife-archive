Many others and I, including those from out of town and friends who have not been to JH before love the food, the space, the service and the reasonable prices. As another poster said, its not meant to be a health food paradise by any means. <br /><br />Your posts have constantly come off as arrogant and condescending ever since you began touting your restaurant. Great way to gain rapport with the vast majority of the neighborhood. Perhaps you should cut your losses and try to open up in Brooklyn or some other gentrified part of NYC. I for one, will tell anyone who is curious about it how pompous, egotistic and patronizing you have been throughout. <br /><br />People like you are what are ruining this city one snooty artisanal overpriced cafe or bistro at a time. This is one of the few remaining neighborhoods in NYC that still retains an authentic feel. Good for the community board to stall your gentrification project.

					Just checked this place out tonight and really enjoyed it. The lady couldn&#039;t have been nicer and the decor is quite elegant and a HUGE change from the old Arunee space that used to be here. <br /><br />As mentioned earlier, many of the options are Southern Thai, a nice change of pace from the Northern Thai that can be found often. Now for the run down of what we ordered: <br /><br />KA NOM JEEN GANG KIEW WARN GAI (Thai Pasta with Chicken, Basil Leaves, Eggplant <br />and Coconut Milk in Green Curry) - Really enjoyed this one, the green curry and coconut milk mix was excellent and had a nice amount of heat to it.<br /><br />PAD PED MOO PHA (Sauté Wild Boar with Young Pepper, Mixed Vegetable and Mix in Chili Sauce) - First time seeing wild boar on a Thai menu, so this was a must-order. This dish really stood out - nice amount of heat and complex layers of flavor with galangal and green peppercorns. <br /><br />PLAH SALMON (Grilled Filleted Salmon Salad with Mints, Lemongrass and Herbs in Red Chili Paste) - Refreshing and light dish, although I felt that there could have been a bit more lemongrass in it. <br /><br />The mango sticky rice was quite tasty - very fresh ripe mangos and a nice presentation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looking forward to checking out more of the dishes and the lunch special looks great, as you can choose from a long list of appetizers to go along with the main (rather than the appetizer just being a toss-in). <br /><br />No liquor license yet, but the lady said that it should be coming shortly. She was very accommodating and said that we could BYOB if we liked. A big positive is that there looked like some nice draft beer taps including Long Trail (!!). <br /><br />Really hope they succeed and highly recommend checking it out. <br />

					Welcome to the neighborhood! <br /><br />I highly recommend Louie&#039;s and not just for their pizza. But since we are on the topic of pizza, try their Grandma - one the best I&#039;ve had. Also a huge fan of their salmon dish (only $12!) and they have many other great specialties at an affordable price as well. <br /><br />Figured that since you&#039;re new to the area that I&#039;ll give you some other suggestions (although not all in Jackson Heights proper). Elmhurst is incredible for affordable authentic grub, particularly of the Southeast Asian variety. <br /><br />Ayada on Woodside Avenue in Elmhurst is excellent (Thai)<br /><br />Mie Jakarta on Whitney Ave in Elmhurst&nbsp; (Indonesian)<br /><br />Phayul on 37 Rd, just off 74th St (Tibetan) <br /><br />Urubamba on 37 Ave &amp; 87 St (Peruvian)<br /><br />La Casa del Pollo Peruano on Roosevelt &amp; 81 St and another location on Roosevelt &amp; 87 St (Peruvian roast chicken - personally has surpassed Pio Pio and is one of the best values in the area)<br /><br /><br /><br />

					Just walked by last night and noticed that it is closed! <br /><br />This became one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood...very friendly staff who are proud of their food and encourage you to try the many great items on the menu. Some memorable meals were the Beef Rendang, spicy Mie Goreng with seafood, Spicy Coconut Chicken or Salmon, different flavors of grilled corn, Indonesian spicy sour vegetable soup and Malaysian Pancake just to name a few...So much flavor with great seasonings and VERY affordable. A dish that comes with their delicious and light fried rice/white rice/fries and salad runs you only $6-$9(for the Salmon). <br /><br />Oh and not to mention their delicious bubble milk tea (especially Taro and Mango)...best bubble tea I&#039;ve had here or Elmhurst.<br /><br />On the bright side, the sign did say that they are relocating, but provided no hint of where. <br /><br />Hope that they re-open soon and close by. Unfortunate, but there is still Java Village and Mie Jakarta in Elmhurst that are both very good and Bromo Satay House and Upi Jaya (have yet to try them).

					The space at Mario&#039;s is very tight and uncomfortable, not to mention that it is a chain that I&#039;ve seen on Houston St. <br /><br />I would much rather support a family-owned, high quality place like Louie&#039;s where you&#039;re treated like family when you become a regular. Can&#039;t beat the restaurant quality dishes under $10, specialty slices packed with toppings with plenty of basil and garlic. Oh and not to mention the HANDMADE agnolotti and fettucini. <br /><br />Seems to me as if Mario&#039;s found a Louie&#039;s menu and priced their items just below that but at a fraction of the quality<br />

					So many to name!<br /><br />Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House for sure...in addition to the noodle soup and dumplings they also have $2.75 scallion pancake (HUGE portions- easily enough for 2)<br /><br />In addition...<br /><br />*Sammy&#039;s Halal Cart - $3 for chicken or lamb pita &amp; $5 for chicken or lamb with rice platter (don&#039;t forget the incredible GREEN SAUCE!)<br /><br />*Louie&#039;s Pizza on Baxter b/w Ithaca &amp; Judge - $1.50 slices/$11 regular pies, $3 specialty slices (could combine with regular slices for a $6 meal)<br /><br />*Tacos al Suadero on 37-57 90 St- $2 tacos WITH guacamole....$7 nachos texanos platter that is big enough for 2, delicious quesadillas (AUTHENTIC) for $6. Open 24/7!<br /><br />*Mama&#039;s Empanadas on Northern &amp; 85th - $1 or $1.50 empanadas (some are more expensive) and usually 3-4 will fill you up depending on which types you order. Personally, the Cubanos are my favorite as they are baked and full of flavor...not to mention open 24/7<br /><br />

					Louie&#039;s is incredible! <br /><br />I&#039;ve been there a number of times and have been greatly impressed by the friendly service and the care that the staff has for their food...they are very gracious and appreciative of your business as well...very refreshing! <br /><br />At $1.50, the regular slice is a steal! Its rare to find a slice under $2.50, let alone one that is as delicious as what you can get here. <br /><br />The Margarita slice is nicely flavored with the right amount of garlic...the pizza has gotten even better with crunchier crust over the past few visits. Also high marks for the chicken &amp; tomato and grandma slices.<br /><br />The agnolotti with pesto sauce is very flavorful and surprisingly light...not to mention that the pasta is homemade. The salmon with basil and tomato is also very light and delicious, sauteed with just the right amount of oil. <br /><br />I look forward to continually supporting such a great establishment...Jackson Heights finally has great pizza!

I didn&#039;t hear anything in the news or anywhere else about it. There is still what appears to be dried blood on 87 St &amp; 34 Ave on the side going towards Northern. <br /><br />Does anyone know about what happened or heard anything about it?
