				Anyone have any tips for evaluating the price of apts. in JH? <br />Any Information for pricing your own place or determining appropriate offers for other places? Are there useful websites that can give you a sense of what places are selling for by neighborhood?&nbsp; I can find asking prices, but I&#039;m curious what are actual selling prices these days given the current market.<br />I know there are countless variables when determining value, but I&#039;m just trying to get a sense of the JH market.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				NYC Department of Finance!&nbsp; (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/property_val_sales.shtml)<br /><br />Just follow the link and get the seachable spreadsheet of sales (condos <span class="bbc_u">AND co-ops</span>) going back to 2003.&nbsp; All you need is the street address...no need for block and lot numbers anymore!&nbsp; Ofcourse, some apartments may be in better shape than others, but I found the sales price info to be very helpful.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s possible that realtors could give you this type of info.&nbsp; If you&nbsp; are trying to figure it out on your own, you could watch the sales listing on the popular r.e. websites for this neighborhood, such as MCP Properties, Jackson Heights Properties and others.&nbsp; On JacksonHeightsProperties, for example, many listings stay online after they have gone into contract and for a short time after they are eventually sold.&nbsp; <br /><br />You could look at the &quot;sold&quot; listings and try to match them with recent closings on a site such as the finance one listed above, or on www.propertyshark.com.&nbsp; The JH Properties site is particularly helpful for this type of research because there are good photos of the interiors of all listings (so you can see the condition of the apartment and whether its been renovated) and the listing also tells you the maintenance (another important factor in sales prices), the address of the bldg and the floor number.&nbsp; <br /><br />The floor number makes it easier to match with the price the apartment actually sold for, as the apartment number is often indicative of the floor it&#039;s on and you&#039;ll need to know that information if there have been several recent sales within one coop.

				Thanks for all this help.<br />That JH properties is very interesting. <br />I signed up for propertyshark but they haven&#039;t sent me a confirmation email.<br />I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m a bit slow and/or dumb when finding specific sales numbers on the NYC Dept of Finance site, but I&#039;ll keep trying.<br /><br />Thanks again.

				The New York Times real estate website now has comps. I did a search recently for condos and coops for sale in 11372 and found the comp information for the last 3 sales in my building. <br /><br />Pretty easy.

				<strong>Jackson Hts is one of the neighborhoods where a 1 bedroom unit could be 20-30% difference in price from one building to another.&nbsp; Even when across the street from the other .&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you need me to tell you that overall you get a lot for your $$$ in Jackson Hts when you take into consideration other similar neighborhoods.&nbsp; Some people would say that it&#039;s expensive but they are not comparing apples with apples.&nbsp; Some Prewar buildings will obviously fetch big $$$ for similar square footage.<br /><br />The absolute way to compare this is with comparables.&nbsp; Simply make a list of the buildings you are interested in and contact the Management company and ask.&nbsp; Some of them will not provide you with them unless you are actually making an offer so may have to say something like &quot;I am about to look into your building and I am interested in a Jr4, 2 bedroom (or whatever you are looking for), would you please provide me with a list of comparables.&quot;.&nbsp; Any responsible and professional Mgmt will do this for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be nice and do not be pushy because they have what you need and they can make up a fictitious excuse not to give it to you.&nbsp; They could say, &quot;please have you mortgage broker, or lawyer or realtor ask for it officially&quot; or something to that effect.<br /><br />Generally a Coop will appraise at no more than 10% of a previous sale in a good market and about 3-5% on just about most markets.&nbsp; Unless negative variables are present and a mortgage banker wants to provide you with a loan, I just haven&#039;t seen anything that would contradict my statement.&nbsp; You also want to use common sense when purchasing a Coop.&nbsp; If you are looking for long term, just about any real estate will do well in NYC.&nbsp; If you are looking for a short term or a flip, don&#039;t unless you are brave and have $$ to gamble.&nbsp; It will take 2 or 3 years to recover your closing cost in this market.&nbsp; Coops will hold well when comparing houses and Condos since they are still the most affordable housing you can purchase.<br /><br />Also, do follow the advice given by the members here.&nbsp; They are all good, solid advice but as you become more and more in-tune with the local market don&#039;t forget &quot;value in use&quot;.&nbsp; In other words, does the unit meet your expenctation.&nbsp; Does it have sufficient room for you and your family.&nbsp; Are you giving somethings up by buying now?&nbsp; What are the trade-offs and are they worth it right now or will they be worth it later on?&nbsp; Does the Coop have a large flip tax?&nbsp; What is the minimum deposit?; just because you bought at 10% from a sponsor doesn&#039;t mean that you will be able to do the same.&nbsp; <br /><br />What is their sublet policy?&nbsp; It may not be important right now but if you are not looking to hold the Coop long term it is always nice to have a liberal coop policy.&nbsp; Many coops are 100% owner occupied and while many here will disagree with me, unless the coop is a prestigious Bldg, a well located Coop with liberal coop rules will be a better business decision.&nbsp; They are easy to resale in the future and will be a better long term investment than a 100% owner occupied.&nbsp; If you are looking for a more personable and homogeneous make up in the inhabitants of a coop and have no intention of moving for a very long time or never, than A 100% owner occupied will probably meet your needs and be more affordable.&nbsp; That is my opinion and others may have different thought, but I sold over 40 coops in the last 18 months in Queens and I speak based on <em>my </em> experience.</strong><br />&nbsp;???

				NYC Native makes some great points.&nbsp; When I was on the market to move from one JH apartment to a larger one, I was shocked by the range in prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another thing to take into account is the monthly maintenance.&nbsp; I found that buildings with low maint often tended to have higher asking prices.&nbsp; That makes sense... your monthly payments (mortgage plus maint) might be the same if you are paying more mort and less maint.&nbsp; If the building itself does not have an outstanding mortgage, that makes the maint cheaper and the unit more valuable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, buildings that have special stuff (amazing gardens, a parking spot, etc.) charge much more than similar buildings without those perks.&nbsp; If a building has a perk that is not important to you, you might want to skip that building, because you will be paying for it.&nbsp; Elevator buildings usually cost more than walk ups.&nbsp; A fireplace adds lots of value.&nbsp; Obviously, strong building financials are a plus, because you can assume that there won&#039;t be unexpected assessments.&nbsp; <br /><br />There seem to be some buildings in JH, which, in my opinion, are just &quot;famous&quot; for no particular reason, and charge much much more for units that are not unlike units you could buy for a lot less a block or two away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also noticed that an extra bedroom was worth a whole lot more than square feet.&nbsp; For example, a 900 square foot junior four, that can easily be converted to a two bedroom, will sell for much more than a 900 square foot one bedroom, even if the&nbsp; two bedroom has boxy little rooms and the one bedroom is open and airy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, location seems to play a big part in pricing.&nbsp; Once you get to the high 80&#039;s, prices seem to drop.&nbsp; In my opinion, that is where the good bargains are now.&nbsp; Also, with a few exceptions, apartments between 37th and Roosevelt seem to be a bit cheaper than apts a block north.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ha!&nbsp; Who knew I would have so much to say about real estate.&nbsp; As I stated in a different thread, I looked at about 40 apartments before I found exactly what I wanted... and learned a whole lot along the way.<br /><br />Good luck with your search.&nbsp;

				Thank you all for your generous help.<br />All very good advice.<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent a lot of time in JH due to my family living there and have a decent idea about what blocks/buildings command the higher prices. This very fact makes comps difficult to determine, but all those web sites listed above have helped enormously. At least I can find what previous sales prices were on specific apts.<br /><br />Yes I&#039;ve been looking into joining my family gang in old 11372.<br /><br />Thanks very much.

				<strong><strong>Whatever you do make sure you are ready whenever a coop or condo comes along that looks like a great deal because just as you may be looking for one there are many like you waiting for YOUR APARTMENT!&nbsp; Diogenes, they will take your unit if you blink.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have already verified the property is a good deal don&#039;t call your cousin in Brooklyn to ask his opinion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Make an offer and don&#039;t let go until you reach upon a price.&nbsp; Then have your lawyer and your mortgage peeps follow up with a phone call.&nbsp; Another way is to simply announce here and in craigslist that you are looking for a property.&nbsp; Explain what you are looking for in detail...that can work many times.<br /><br />I just wanted to expand to everyone out there what ready means.&nbsp; I doesn&#039;t mean emotionally or mentally ready.&nbsp; You must be willing, able and ready regardless. Please, don&#039;t finance a new Benz weeks before you decide to make an offer because your APR may just shoot up faster than the price of gasoline.&nbsp; Any MLS realtor can let you know what&#039;s out there since they have access to the same list unless they are exclusives and of course sponsor units (they tend to sell faster if they are reasonably priced thus not needing the MLS mechanism).&nbsp; Just find someone that is patient (not me :tickedoff:) and is willing to work with you.&nbsp; As I said before, if you are really ready any local realtor will work with you.<br /><br />Good luck and I hope you all that you hope for! :)</strong> &nbsp;</strong>

				The only comps that matter for JH coops are other sales in the same building.&nbsp; You can&#039;t do a simple square footage calculation because there are too many differences in maintenance payments and amenities.&nbsp; Try looking up the building you are interested in through ACRIS (Automated City Register Information System.)<br />This system will show you sales prices, refinances and other activity.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/jump/acris.shtml

				The comps in a building can be confusing (I found in my own search years ago), as some apartments are fully and recently renovated, and some haven&#039;t been changed since the early 70s! :-\
