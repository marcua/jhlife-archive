			Yes, but visual literacy and video capabilities of folks is increasing exponentially. These have become sophisticated and often ironic and smart.<br /><br />It&#039;s the future...and it&#039;s exciting...<br /><br />Change is inevitable. And I look forward to it. <br /><br />Meanwhile....<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;M AGAINST IT<br />Groucho Marx (One of Groucho’s most famous comic songs is this one from the 1932 comedy film Horse Feathers.)<br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t know what they have to say<br />It makes no difference anyway<br />Whatever it is, I&#039;m against it<br />No matter what it is or who commenced it<br />I&#039;m against it<br /><br />Your proposition may be good<br />But let&#039;s have one thing understood:<br />Whatever it is, I&#039;m against it<br />And even when you&#039;ve changed it or condensed it<br />I&#039;m against it<br /><br />I&#039;m opposed to it<br />On general principles, I&#039;m opposed to it<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/3cKUppvjJuw<br /><br />
