					The Mimi for Me studio is such a wonderful, beautiful oasis in this city and in our lovely Jackson Heights. I agree with the petition writer that this is a beloved space and not only has it housed yoga classes &amp; Pilates &amp; dance, this is where dozens of us brought our children for the past three years for Story Garden.<br /><br />It is heartbreaking to see that there is talk of the studio closing. Mimi for Me, as well as Terraza7 Cafe/Bar on Gleane St, are unique spaces in the neighborhood. And now Terraza is facing eviction as well because of talk of a new building go up on the property. <br /><br />What can these businesses do to survive this? Will a petition really give these businesses the boost they need to keep going in the spaces they are in?

					I hope you connected with the new parents groups through Yahoo, Facebook &amp; Googlegroups! There are also many activities in the neighborhood for babies and toddlers like Queens Library kids&#039; programs (comprehensive list @ <a href="http://m.queenslibrary.org/events/?filters=ev_age:Kids" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://m.queenslibrary.org/events/?filters=ev_age:Kids</a>), NYSci Corona&#039;s &quot;PreSchool Place&quot; (which has infant section), Fiesta Kids indoor playground on Roosevelt Ave (also with separate toddler section), plus local Jackson Heights programs like Kids Music Together, Bilingual Sprouts, MKD Karate, and Superkickers. There&#039;s also a Gymboree one subway stop away in Forest Hills. Fortunately JH station &amp; FH both have elevators, if you use stroller.<br /><br />Ocasionally Mimi for Me yoga studio on 37th Ave offers Mommy &amp; Me post natal yoga too. If you want to venture outside the area with your little one, there are excellent post natal Mommy &amp; Me Pilates workshops on E14th St in Manhattan, and also in Wmsburg Bklyn. They&#039;re not only good workouts, but a nice way to meet other parents with children similar in age.

					Thank you for sharing. I am so disheartened by this news. Despite its recent state of disrepair, the Jackson Triplex is a classic structure. It has been in our neighborhood since before the Great Depression. There must be a way to at least save the exterior; to incorporate it into the developer&#039;s new plans.<br /><br />In the 1960s, Greenwich Village residents saved the Jefferson Market Library structure from being demolished. <br />They almost did not succeed, and we wouldn&#039;t have the beautiful, historic structure that still stands on 6th Ave off W8th St.<br /><br />Architect Lord Norman Foster preserved the exterior of the 1920s Hearst Enterprises bldg on W57th St, when designing the bldg&#039;s extension. I&#039;m sure Hearst&#039;s capital &amp; popularity helped make that happen, but <br />how can we, in little ol&#039; JH, have the developers respect our old structure and preserve it? It&#039;s a link to our past. Who can we appeal to?<br /><br />I&#039;m so tired of seeing classic NY structures demolished right and left. (Just last year, W29th St lost a classic bldg next to Marble Collegiate Church, just to be replaced with a bland modern bldg across from the swanky Ace Hotel.<br />I&#039;ll bet the plans for what we&#039;ll be getting on 82nd St won&#039;t even be swanky!)

					Speaking of ice cream trucks, the one that &quot;greets&quot; you on the way to the Queens Zoo is a real piece of work. On our most recent trip, she suddenly charged us a dollar extra for a cup (vs cone) saying cups were &quot;more expensive to produce.&quot; When I pointed out this wasn&#039;t stated on her menu, she said, &quot;I don&#039;t make the prices, sweetie, the park does.&quot; Huh?<br />On another occasion she just handed my toddler ice cream when he merely pointed to it -- without asking me if that was OK. And then charged me for it; she could sense I was fuming and said something dismissive like, &quot;I could give you a refund if that&#039;s what you want.&quot;

					Hey look, your post was noted in <a href="http://jacksonheightspost.com/man-captures-pigeons-outside-barbershop-in-what-owner-describes-as-cruel-act/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jacksonheightspost.com/man-captures-pigeons-outside-barbershop-in-what-owner-describes-as-cruel-act/</a><br />[Since when did neighborhood message boards become on-the-record quotes for reporters?]<br />Thanks for pointing out what&#039;s been happening to NY pigeons...the ones in Washington Sq Park are especially friendly and were even featured in an episode of Blue Bloods (but not captured!) The news stories you posted seem to imply that the kidnapped pigeons are being used for sport (sad). But BTW there is at least one shop in Elmhurst, on Broadway, that has pigeon on the menu (but I will assume their livestock is humanely raised, their diets monitored, etc...)

One said that law enforcement from the local precinct IS on the way to investigate right now; <br />another posted there was actually an INSTAGRAM video posted from the party Labor Day weekend that initially set the fireworks off... Can the local authorities find the offending parties through that?<br />

					Just wanted to follow up on this thread from last spring, since the Bruson Bldg (75th St/37th Ave) is still undergoing renovations.&nbsp; An article about a mini-mall in Bushwick was just published in DNAinfo yesterday, and it made me think that perhaps the Bruson owners should try hiring Jenel Management instead of Sabra Realty…Maybe, just maybe, they&#039;d seek more creative additions to the neighborhood (besides their proposed fast food joints) -- <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150911/bushwick/bushwick-shoppers-world-be-replaced-with-mini-mall" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150911/bushwick/bushwick-shoppers-world-be-replaced-with-mini-mall</a><br />

					According to a media report, the man who committed this crime lives in Brooklyn, on Pitkin Ave. <br /><br />If anything I am grateful to those people in Jackson Heights who caught him and immediately called the authorities.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the first time Jackson Heights locals have stepped in/stepped up after a purse snatching and held the person until the police could intervene. (I remember an incident about 15 years ago when a purse snatcher knocked down a cop, so a resident took him down)<br /><br />Of course these maneuvers are dangerous, but that&#039;s why we call these people heroes.<br />Thank you to all of those who have risked themselves to help others.

					On Sept 4th, there were official notices up re: a movie being shot on location in Jackson Heights, in the vicinity of 34th Ave &amp; 79th St, in front of Joseph Pulitzer Junior High. Just curious what the project was, if anyone knows what was filming there that weekend!

					I&#039;m going to have a booth at the 74th St/34th Ave flea market you mention! I&#039;m not sure if there are spots available there either, but it&#039;s coordinated by the school&#039;s PTA co-president and payments to participate are usually due three days before event (which would be today). The money goes towards benefiting IS 230.<br /><br />I hope you can make it before or after the other flea market on 34th Ave. (This one is from 8AM to 6PM)<br />

					Their cafe con leche (coffee with steamed milk) is delicious and it&#039;s $1!<br /><br />I also love their kale &amp; pavo omelette with side salad; a fantastic brunch option.

					An excellent piece just came out from the New Yorker magazine about how high commercial rents are negatively affecting wonderful neighborhoods throughout NYC, including the West Village. It also features some solutions for this issue, including this blurb:<br />&gt; If high-rent blight hurts New York’s municipal economy, what, if anything, might be done? Because the problem is tied almost inextricably to the value of New York real estate generally, there are no simple fixes. The #SaveNYC movement and the Small Business Congress NYC advocate the regulation of lease renewal. They support a bill written by the small-business advocate Steve Null that tries to limit rent spikes by making commercial-lease-renewal disputes subject to mandatory mediation and arbitration, like some baseball salaries. Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, supports a different regulation of lease renewals, coupled with zoning rules, that encourages landlords to quit waiting for the jackpot and to start renting. Some, like Moss, want to fine landlords who leave storefronts abandoned, in the hope that they’ll then rent to smaller, quirkier companies instead of Chipotle. There may also be other original solutions to the specific problem of high-rent blight, such as, perhaps, finding ways to let pop-up stores use abandoned spaces on a seasonal basis. &lt;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-are-there-so-many-shuttered-storefronts-in-the-west-village?mbid=rss" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-are-there-so-many-shuttered-storefronts-in-the-west-village?mbid=rss</a><br />
