				Oh my God - that fire happened so quickly!!!&nbsp; I&#039;m right across 84th St. from it.&nbsp; I looked out my window and there was some smoke coming from the vents of the building and the Fire Dept. had just arrived.&nbsp; Within minutes, there were orange flames shooting through the roof at least 3 stories high!

				I think you&#039;re right, Madalyn. Although the smoke is getting lighter in color, I can see the FD pulling another new line on 85th street, which is probably an indication that the situation is not totally under control. And you are right, there are still flames though smaller. <br /><br />You&#039;re lucky to be north of it, we&#039;re south and it&#039;s blowing right at us. We closed up all windows but the smoke has permeated even my clothes. <br /><br />And now the choppers have arrived ...

				Keep your windows closed even if you are north of the fire.&nbsp; There seem to be some chemicals burning -- at least that&#039;s how it looks from the color of the smoke.<br /><br />I saw that there are firefighters who have entered the apartment building on 84th just north of the barber shop.&nbsp; Looks like they have gone up to the 3rd floor and have their hoses out the window pointing down into the back of what may be the furniture store.

				No, the Cavalier was a block up (b/n 85th and 86th), the fire is b/n 84th and 85th. It seemed to me that the whole row is gone (or at least from Willo the barber shop to the liquor store to the art store when I was leaving), which begs the question of what is going to happen with that lot now. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I heard from some onlookers that a developer had wanted to tear down the buildings and build something else there, don&#039;t know the details but it does raise the question of whether this fire was deliberately started. There have been no reports yet of any suspicious origins but will be interesting to follow this story after the fire is brought under control and the NYFD has a change to search through the rubble. Might be hard to investigate with all the inflammables on premises: liquor bottles, dry cleaning solvents, beauty supplies.<br />&nbsp;<br />L

				&quot;I heard from some onlookers that a developer had wanted to tear down the buildings and build something else there, don&#039;t know the details but it does raise the question of whether this fire was deliberately started. There have been no reports yet of any suspicious origins but will be interesting to follow this story after the fire is brought under control and the NYFD has a change to search through the rubble. Might be hard to investigate with all the inflammables on premises: liquor bottles, dry cleaning solvents, beauty supplies.<br />&nbsp;<br />L&quot;<br /><br />As a community, we may be able to approach our politicos and ask for a separate inquiry.<br /><br />Best, &nbsp;:smiley6600:

				Shelby, that&#039;s helpful. I thought the Art Gallery was also engulfed, glad I was wrong. <br /><br />Seems then that the row of stores consists of 2 blgs (confirmed by google&#039;s satellite view), and only one of them (the western one) burned down. <br /><br />

				So, to get a summary - which stores are destroyed by the fire and which stores may have some smoke and water damage but are recoverable? Is there recoverable property or all needs to be rebuilt? Also, any talk about the cause of the fire - insurance fire or accident?

				I got three texts from Notify NYC (which by the way is a great resource and I advise everyone to do the free registration at notifynyc.com) about the 4 alarm fire but to see it was unbelievable.&nbsp; I hope all are OK and those businesses well insured (especially in this economy).<br /><br />I do think it&#039;s best to avoid the negative speculation and focus on providing relief to those affected.

				You&#039;re right on not dwelling on the negative, I am glad that no one was hurt - it&#039;s truly amazing that everyone was able to get out on time and that the fire didn&#039;t jump back to the residential building (although i am sure they will have some smoke damage).&nbsp; I do worry about the business owners and their livelyhood as well as the people they employed.&nbsp; I know how insurance companies can screw you over so I am hoping everyone will be ok in the long run.&nbsp; But as someone invested in the neighborhood - it really hurts me to know that these ruins will be sitting there for a long time probably and worse that developers could come in and destroy the look and feel of our homey little town, because that is what it felt like at least to me.

				The smoke was so bad at our place, 85th and 37th, we had to leave for the day. Came back at 4 and our house still smelled smoky. <br />It was so sad to see the news reports, and see Mrs. Lalita from the party shop, lamenting not being able to delivery on her Valentine orders. Having her business ruined, and worried about others. We&#039;ve been so fortunate to have a lovely small business atmosphere to do our shopping in, I pray they find a way to regroup and rebuild. Mrs. Lalita always gave my kid a free balloon, and I&#039;d just discovered that the place had beautiful kids party shoes of spanish leather. <br /><br />What a tragedy. Thank God there were no injuries, but these poor people are hurting.

				Does anyone know anything about fire clauses in commercial leases?&nbsp; &nbsp;From what I&#039;ve read, it looks like significant damage from a fire allows the landlord to terminate a lease.<br /><br />http://www.abanet.org/rppt/publications/magazine/2000/ma00sharkey1.html<br /><br />The proper analysis of the damage and destruction provisions of a lease, sometimes called the &quot;fire clause,&quot; involves many different and often conflicting concerns of the landlord, the tenant and their respective lenders. Unfortunately, the fire clause frequently turns into a battleground over ways to terminate the lease or to keep it from being terminated, depending on a particular party&#039;s viewpoint and the type of lease involved. <strong>For example, in the case of a shopping center in which the landlord is the party that will repair or rebuild the premises, the fire clause in the landlord&#039;s lease form will usually include many conditions under which <span class="bbc_u">the landlord alone may elect either to terminate the lease </span> or to repair or rebuild the premises.</strong>

				Well, Shelby, I&#039;m afraid you are right. Even if the fire clause of their leases specifically was more liberal, I can hardly envision these small business owners doing a gut renovation of the scale necessary here. <br /><br />The owner of the lot is WENZHOU N.Y.

				With the landmarking designation, there may be muscle to restrict what can be put back or what can replace the destroyed property. For example, here at Roosevelt Terrace, we are working at the structure (underground roofing) for one of the underground garages (with an out door parking lot over it). We were required to replace concrete retaining walls that matched the original ones. We had changed them about 15 years ago to brick ones with coping stones that matched the buildings. However, Landmarks required the construction to match the original ones.<br /><br />This that as an example, I be live we have a good push to have the property on 37th be built to match these destroyed taxpayers. Even with the zoning allowing an apartment building, that is not within the landmarks designation. This is a good and worthwhile fight to maintain the flavor of this community. That is how Jackson Heights Beautification Group came about in the first place. Fighting the horrible concept for a replacement after another major fire (or three in the same place). It is time to wage this battle again.

				Another one of the stories that has come out of this incident is the fact that the mayor plans to close 20 fire houses throughout the city.

Fires like that tend to happen in the wee hours of the morning when there&#039;s less chance of harm to human life. Also, if the rents were already being jacked up in en effort to clear the lot I don&#039;t see the incentive to start a fire. Seems easier , cheaper, and faster to wait out the tenants and then sell the block off to developers.

Fires like that tend to happen in the wee hours of the morning when there&#039;s less chance of harm to human life. Also, if the rents were already being jacked up in en effort to clear the lot I don&#039;t see the incentive to start a fire. Seems easier , cheaper, and faster to wait out the tenants and then sell the block off to developers. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very true.

				JH Times: Dromm Secures Assistance for Fire VictimsShare<br />Sun at 9:56am<br /><br />by Anna Gustafson<br />A four-alarm fire ravaged an entire block in Jackson Heights Saturday, destroying eight businesses and forcing the evacuation of about 100 residents, fire officials said.<br /><br />Nearly 170 firefighters worked for 3 1/2 hours to extinguish the blaze that began at 9:53 a.m. Saturday morning in the Acme Furniture store at 84-09 37th Ave., officials said. Four firefighters sustained injuries and were treated at area hospitals, officials said. No civilians were hurt in the blaze, an FDNY spokesman said.<br /><br />The fire, which sent plumes of smoke into the sky that could be seen from miles away, was under control by 1:30 p.m., according to an FDNY official.<br /><br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) said his office met with owners of the affected businesses Saturday and said the city Department of Small Business Services has arranged to give those affected by the fire â€œimmediate assistance.â€<br /><br />Dromm also met with evacuated residents, many of whom have been able to return to their homes, to help secure â€œmedical assistance for those in need, including seniors and the disabled, and make special arrangements for pets.â€

				The first thing I thought about was the poor shoemaker dude and I was so pleasantly surprised to see I am not the only one! <br /><br />Someone mentioned a fundraiser, and I think that&#039;s a great idea. Even something simple like collecting donations for those businesses affected would be great.<br /><br /><br />I just really really hope this lot doesn&#039;t go to shit like the one on 82nd and 37th did after it&#039;s fire years ago. Hopefully the same or similar business have the chance to rebuild there.
