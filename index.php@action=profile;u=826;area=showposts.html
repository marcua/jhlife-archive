					Hi. My apartment on 85th Street between Roosevelt and 37th is available for some or all of the rental period you seek. <br />It&#039;s a 2 bedroom on a really nice street. <br />I&#039;d like to get $1,800/month for it, but I&#039;m a bit flexible. The 2nd bedroom is my son&#039;s room, which is packed with books and toys. <br />I can be reached at 9172510024. <br />Currently I have an old friend staying for August. <br />

					I&#039;m glad the Sunshine shop is gone. Hopefully, my complaints helped. <br />They illegally allowed folks to shop with SNAP and EBT cards for things like candy and toys. <br />It was infuriating to see them make illegal sales and abuse the government welfare system. <br />How do I know? We were offered this payment option, and they kept a sign in the window. <br />

					The Prime vehicle seems new to me here in the neighborhood. Like, the last couple of months. And- what a scourge!! <br />Those that receive deliveries might want to help out with solutions for the extra congestion they cause. <br />Someone mentioned a 7/11 as a drop/pickup spot. Isn&#039;t there a better way to get service without further jamming up the streets? <br />For whatever reason shopping locally is out the question, what else can be done? <br />It would be cool if ours was the first neighborhood for cargo bike delivery.

					Parks has a program called, Weekend Walks. It&#039;s meant to shut down a commercial street for activities, a little different than a street fair. <br />I&#039;ve wanted to do it here, from 74th to 81st, which represents where three pedestrians were killed by reckless drivers. <br /><br />Senator Ramos was interested too, but we missed the deadline for this year. <br />My idea is to have shops participate- mimicking a great event in PA, there is a chocolate walk. People buy a card and get it stamped at each shop they visit- in return the shops offer some chocolate treat concocted by themselves or a local chef. (Litich Chocolate Fest- if you want to look it up, it&#039;s awesome)<br /><br />The greatest dream of the weekend walk for me would be to have street games. Now, I&#039;ve seen excellent videos of street games around the world, and it would be incredible to see them played on this stretch. The variations of the same game would be cool, and surely they would incorporate regional flair. <br /><br />Finally, PS 89, where my son attended does have a designated play street. It&#039;s got a DOT sign, and I checked with community board, cops and the elected- they can close it during the day from 8-4 anytime. Sadly, they don&#039;t- basically because they want the parking spots. I have managed to have it used for mariachi concert and some fitness and earth day activities. <br /><br />The principal finally won on keeping it closed. Now, the kids have no gym and barely a play yard- so it would have been great to give them space...Anyway, the principal said it was a safety issue, that there are known sexual predators nearby. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t fight that- but I steamed thinking, our kids live in this neighborhood, unlike the teachers whom about 85% commute from Long Island. It was a rough blow. <br /><br />Anyway- I hope people are still interested, if we apply for weekend walks next year. They do it for Songkram on Woodside Ave.

Maybe not for a big job, but for small repairs it might be nice to try him out. He&#039;s always busy.

					Good morning, <br />Basically we&#039;re trying to separate our marriage, which is amicable- but our place is getting too small. <br />If we became known as the neighborhood house-sitters, like some folks are cat-sitters that might be ideal as we plan. <br />Would like one of us to have a place to crash and spend some hours away from our home in order to keep it amicable. <br /><br />JH/Elmhurst is key, as we co-parent in just about every way. <br />We are tidy, responsible, and quiet, and as noted, just need some space. <br />Thanks for any leads.

					We have a very traditional Italian bread bakery on 90th. I can&#039;t think of the name, but it&#039;s just north of Roosevelt on east side of 90th. <br />Really good italian bread, rolls and the like. <br />I&#039;m mad about biscotti and italian cookies. I have a collection of bakery business cards, and they are on top of those traditional biscuits.

					Of the car owners who seldom drive-are you paying for parking, have a parking spot at home or using the parking lane, the curb storage for weeks on end? Looking at those parking spots and thinking of how some could be loading zones, and the rest could have higher meter costs (they did just go up) just really irks me. <br />I also noticed that DOT is hiring 2 or three different parking analyst positions. Maybe they are rethinking parking? That would be great. <br />There are some good suggestions in these comments.

					It&#039;s true some need cars. But I just want to put it out in public forum that there are many, a majority like me whose transit options are as follows- Walk, bike, bus, train, or don&#039;t go. Sure, sometimes it&#039;s painful to be limited, but as mentioned- we rent cars as needed. It&#039;s worked out great. And- from the non-vehicle, road user perspective- it&#039;s made me a better driver and parker. I don&#039;t circle- I sit at a hydrant and wait. Usually about 20 minutes.

					<br />Reposted from JH Families. Map won&#039;t load, it can be found on fb- Jackson Heights 11372 or Make Queens Safer. <br />I have to say, I am a pedestrian and bike advocate in the community, and often when attending community board meetings, people have never heard such language as &quot;ditch your car&quot; but it&#039;s a pretty popular idea I thought I&#039;d share. (check out @waroncars podcast)<br /><br />Sorry folks, we have a crisis in Jackson Heights of PEDESTRIANS getting killed by reckless drivers- and reducing the number of cars has got to happen. This is a quaint little neighborhood, council districts are about 160,000 people...and driving is not an entitlement, it&#039;s a privilege- and let&#039;s hope people can see the sense in cutting down some of the unnecessary trips. It&#039;d be great too if people could retrain their brains to walk short distances, whether it&#039;s farther out for parking, unloading and carting your supplies a block or two, putting your kids in local schools or taking mass transit. <br /><br />Also, there is a very good chance congestion pricing will pass in Albany this term- that will open up many more channels for better mass transit and bike/pedestrian infrastructure. <br /><br />Now, to pull back from that statement- please look at your driving habits differently. Are you speeding up to catch a yellow light, turn a corner, grab a spot? Do you gun the vehicle after being stuck behind a double parker, not looking a block ahead to the crosswalk? Do you block bike lanes, forcing cyclists into oncoming traffic? Do you allow proper &quot;due care&quot; to be able to maintain control, if some surprise like a mom stopping in a crosswalk to pick up a dropped shoe, an old lady not quite making it before the light changes? <br /><br />For once, just think about the number of times individual drivers circle a neighborhood trying to park- park for weeks on end, or park to run in a shop, or double park to pick someone up, or park in crosswalks, or corners that block the view for those of us on foot- who deserve to not be terrorized by reckless driving. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say 14 is the number of people who&#039;ve been killed walking in our neighborhood in the last 5 years. <br />(a map is included) That&#039;s horrendous. <br />The three fatalities in just 7 blocks on 37th happened like this-<br />Driver reversed into SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE in crosswalk at 74th<br />Driver mounted sidewalk, killing SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE&nbsp; at 78th <br />Driver drove directly into SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE in crosswalk and ran her over 2 times on 81st. <br /><br />Each of us have horror stories of near misses and so many of us know SOMEBODY&#039;&#039;S LOVED ONE whose had an injury, sometimes life changing, definitely costly and kept them out of work. <br /><br />We&#039;ve had DOT redesign streets, JH Historic District implemented a neighborhood slow zone, Lead Pedestrian Intervals, changes to signal timing, and even a pedestrian safety forum back in around 2014. <br /><br />My family rents cars at LaGuardia when we need them- mainly to promptly leave town. We&#039;re able to return the car directly afterward so as not to contribute to the ridiculous circling around and being reckless in every way. Oh, U-Turns too- How long till someone dies from a U-Turning driver mounting the sidewalk, crashing into a storefront? <br /><br />Many neighbors have expressed outrage, shame and fear over this most recent fatality- hopefully this will mobilize folks to go to precinct council meetings and urge elected&#039;s to seek out new resources...enforcement is key for me- every driver ticketed, repeatedly and with increasing penalties and vehicle confiscation, as the poor ebike riders tolerate. <br /><br />Our community has suffered from a crisis of preventable deaths. It&#039;s a symptom of having too many cars on the roads. Sure, there are reckless drivers and unlicensed drivers, and yes- you&#039;ll blame the pedestrians- but as a pedestrian and cyclist, like many of us in the neighborhood- we see traffic differently. <br />Commissioner Trottenberg of DOT has said, &quot;If you&#039;re in traffic, you are traffic&quot; <br /><br />Every day in our neighborhood, thousands of parents and caregivers are lugging baby strollers up subway stairs, through cumbersome doorways, soon through daunting snowbanks. They are stopped practically every block to wait for the light- they are your equals- residents of a community that can&#039;t afford another tragic and preventable death. <br /><br />Please look at your driving habits differently- even if you&#039;ve never killed or injured anyone. <br />
