					Join me at an open house for a lovely one bedroom apartment (with fireplace) at the gorgeous Towers cooperative.&nbsp; Asking price is $315,000<br /><br />Sunday, October 12th from 12 noon to 1:30pm<br />33-16 81st Street - Ring Bell 62A&nbsp; &nbsp; [Meet Daniel Karatzas&nbsp; 646 285 7762]<br /><br />Here is the URL for the advertisement on the New York Times:<br /><a href="http://realestate.nytimes.com/sales/detail/857-500A222716F19/33-16-81st-Street-QUEENS-NY-11372" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://realestate.nytimes.com/sales/detail/857-500A222716F19/33-16-81st-Street-QUEENS-NY-11372</a><br /><br />Rarely available.&nbsp; This one-bedroom apartment at the Towers includes the magnificent fireplace with its 5’ tall mantle.&nbsp; There are also parquet floors in the living room and bedroom, along with high ceilings, plaster walls, and the charm and character only found in grand, prewar garden apartments in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Located on the top (6th) floor, with sun-filled windows facing east and south, this 700 square foot apartment is comprised of three rooms: a 15’x 20’ living room separated with French doors from the large bedroom with its wall of built-in closets, an updated kitchen and restored original bathroom. <br /><br />Designed by Andrew J. Thomas, the landmarked Towers is the finest pre-Depression garden apartment complex in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The large and elaborate landscaped garden was designed by Noel Chamberlain.&nbsp; There is even a children’s play area/garden at the northern end.&nbsp; The Towers’ eight buildings have been beautifully maintained.&nbsp; Each building has laundry facilities and a free storage bin.&nbsp; 10% down and board approval are required.&nbsp; Maintenance is $574 and there is currently an assessment of $82/month that will end in&nbsp; January of 2017.&nbsp; Located in the Jackson Heights Historic District, and close to transportation, restaurants, shopping, and our weekly Greenmarket. <br />

					The 1Q14 is available for free by subscribing at <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br /><br />It is the most comprehensive and detailed analysis of real estate trends in the 11372 zip code.&nbsp; Here is my quick overview:<br /><br />As expected, the volume of transactions fell in the first quarter, compared with the stellar results of 4Q2013.&nbsp; Perhaps real estate was another victim of our prolonged winter season.&nbsp; Only four houses closed in the first quarter, down about 70% from the prior and year-ago period.&nbsp; Average sales prices were down for one- and three-family houses, but up for two-family units.&nbsp; The 84 apartments sold in the first quarter were 45% below the fourth quarter, but up 18% over the year ago period.&nbsp; The good news were that average sales prices were modestly higher across all apartment types compared with both periods.<br /><br />Thus far, the spring buying season remains strong, with the dearth of inventory being the greatest challenge.&nbsp; Jackson Heights remains on the radar screens of many “down-scalers from Manhattan” and Brooklynites heading north for more space and more reasonable prices.<br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br /><a href="http://www.beaudoinrealty.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.beaudoinrealty.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br />

					In 2008 the Jackson Heights Beautification Group sent in a Request for Evaluation to landmark the La Mesa Verde Apartment on 90th &amp; 91st Streets, between 35th and 34th Avenues.&nbsp; (See below) The request was rejected.&nbsp; In 2008 the trees in the garden were cut down and an application to turn the garden into a parking lot was submitted.&nbsp; In March, residents (it is a rent-regulated building) were sent a &quot;Notice of Commencement of Proceeding Upon Owner&#039;s Application for Permission to Change or Decrease Dwelling Space, Etc.&quot; to proceed with turning the garden into a parking lot.&nbsp; The tenants have until about April 15th to vote for or against this, but the complete process to a parking lot is not known.&nbsp; &nbsp;Curb cuts and a driveway had existed for years, but now the plans are for a parking lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />This building should have been landmarked.&nbsp; Smiths &quot;Cherokee Flats&quot; (loving written about in the 2/2/14 NY Times Streetscapes column) in Manhattan are, of course, landmarked.&nbsp; Please contact Councilmember Julissa Ferraras at 718 651 1917, and let her know that a landmark-worthy garden apartment complex should not have its garden turned into a parking lot.&nbsp; Although not in his district, you can call Councilmember Daniel Dromm&#039;s office at 718 803 6373.&nbsp; Both share parts of our existing Jackson Heights Historic District.<br /><br />The application was made through the State of New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal Office of Rent Administration at Gertz Plaza 92-31 Union Hall St&nbsp; Jamaica, NY&nbsp; 11433&nbsp; 718 739 6400&nbsp; &nbsp; Docket # CN 110002 OD.&nbsp; Address given as 34-46 91 Street<br /><br />The La Mesa Verde Apartments were built by the Open Stairs Dwelling Company (OSDC) and designed by Henry Atterbury Smith.&nbsp; The OSDC acquired the land from the Queensboro Corporation, the developer of Jackson Heights, and completed the La Mesa Verde Apartments in 1926, making them contemporary with the already designated Jackson Heights Historic District.&nbsp; Smith also designed (the already designated) East River Homes (also known as the Shively Sanitary Apartments and the Cherokee Flats) in 1912.&nbsp; The La Mesa Verde Apartments are similar in concept to the East River Homes.<br />The complex is made up of six detached buildings, connected by sky-bridges, located between 90th and 91st Streets, between 35th and 34th Avenues.&nbsp; The buildings are set at an angle to the street grid, and form a saw-tooth pattern down both blocks.&nbsp; They enclose a large internal garden courtyard, similar to the garden apartments built by the Queensboro Corporation.&nbsp; There are no interior hallways at the La Mesa Verde; all apartments are reached directly from the open stairs.&nbsp; There is only one elevator for these six-story buildings.&nbsp; Tenants on higher floors ride the elevator up to the roof, then walk across the sky-bridges to their buildings, and then walk down the stairs to their apartment.<br />At the La Mesa Verde Smith was influenced any ancient pueblo architecture of the American Southwest.&nbsp; Pueblo buildings of similar height, with their flat roofs and ladder-like stairs were his primary inspiration.&nbsp; There were practical advantages to this: “Think of having your own cottage outside door, although living on the fifth or sixth floor.&nbsp; Open stairs make possible elevator apartments with no smells from the basement and absolutely no stair odors from other people’s apartments.” (quote from Queensboro Magazine)<br />Here are some comments about the importance of these buildings from Columbia Professor Richard Plunz:<br />In the 1920s the work of Henry Atterbury Smith, who had pioneered an earlier generation of philanthropic housing including the open stair tenement, paralleled (Andrew) Thomas’ and (Henry) Wright’s housing research.&nbsp; His work was far more exploratory, however.&nbsp; In 1917 Smith set a precedent with the first theoretical work proposing that building geometry could deviate from the geometry of the New York gridiron.&nbsp; He suggested that buildings did not have to be oriented along lot lines and argued that other geometries, based on purely functional considerations such as light and view, might be superimposed on the gridiron.&nbsp; (page 174)<br />Smith’s Mesa Verde housing was more radical.&nbsp; The project, which was completed in 1926, assimilated many of his ideas of the previous decade.&nbsp; (page 176)<br />By 1926 the Mesa Verde was as radical an alternative to traditional housing as anything realized in the Netherlands and Germany&nbsp; (page 180)<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History of Housing in New York City,&nbsp; &nbsp;Richard Plunz, page 174-180 (that includes original photos of the La Mesa Verde Apartments)<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson Heights – A Garden in the City,&nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel Karatzas&nbsp; pages 79-81<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert A.M. Stern, “The New York Apartment House”&nbsp; Via&nbsp; Volume #4&nbsp; 1980&nbsp; page 83<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queensboro Magazine&nbsp; November 1925&nbsp; page 642<br />

					I have issued my 4Q2013 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report (sorry for the delay, the city was tardy in updating the public record) which highlights a very good year for sales and a positive upward trend, especially for apartments.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy by subscribing on <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br /><br />Here is a brief synopsis:<br /><br />2013 was certainly the “turnaround” year, when both sales volumes and average sales prices increased.&nbsp; Sales of houses in the 11372 zip code, while essentially flat to 2012, experienced much higher average sales prices across the board when compared with 2012.&nbsp; Apartment sales rose dramatically, to 429, up 50% from 2012.&nbsp; The trend increased quarter by quarter, and fourth quarter 2013 sales were the highest in over seven years.&nbsp; While the number of sales rose dramatically, average sales price increases were more moderate, rising by no more than 11% in any category.&nbsp; Demand for larger apartments drove prices past pre-financial crisis peaks.&nbsp; For the first time ever, six-room units at Hawthorne Court passed the $700,000 mark.&nbsp; Seven room units at The Towers and The Chateau, in less renovated condition, sold for just under the $700,000 level.&nbsp; <br /><br />As prices rose elsewhere – especially Manhattan and “brownstone” Brooklyn - Jackson Heights, especially its historic district, also benefited.&nbsp; Interestingly, buyers of both houses and large apartments have come from not only outside the neighborhood, but from existing residents as well.&nbsp; This bodes well for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.&nbsp; No one knows the neighborhood like I do!<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />

					I just received the monthly agenda for Community Board 3 - whose next public meeting is Thursday, November 21st at 7:45 pm at the Louis Armstrong School at 32-02 Junction Boulevard.<br /><br />The Traffic/Transportation Committee will review the application for a Newsstand for the southeast corner of 76 Street and 37 Avenue made by Foodtown (76-10 37th Avenue).&nbsp; I have contacted Councilmember Dromm&#039;s office, to say that the last thing our crowded streets need is a newsstand.&nbsp; There is a newspaper/candy store right across the street from Foodtown, and another newsstand two blocks west at 74 Street and 37 Avenue.&nbsp; Why do merchants feel it is there right to plant a newsstand on our streets?<br /><br />If you feel, like I do, that this newsstand serves no purpose for our community, I suggest you do the following:<br /><br />1. Contact Councilman Dromm&#039;s office at 718 803 6373<br />2. Contact the Coummunity Board at 718 458 2707 or <a href="mailto:communityboard3@nyc.rr.com" class="bbc_email">communityboard3@nyc.rr.com</a><br />3. Contact Foodtown by walking in and expressing your opinion (I am likely to take my business elsewhere from now on)<br /><br />While we were unsuccessful at stopping another unwanted newsstand at the northeast corner of 74 Street and 37 Road, it is worth the effort in making your voice heard.

					The warm weather has brought with it a new fruit and vegetable vendor at the corner of 82nd Street and 37th Avenue in front of the CapitalOne bank.&nbsp; I already spoke with the 82nd Street Partnership who said it has contacted the police about this unwanted and unwelcome eyesore.&nbsp; We have had a food truck parked on the same corner for years now, and I guess it will never leave.&nbsp; While we all might complain about the quality of our merchants, they are least paying rent and taxes and not crowding our already crowded commercial streets.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that residents and passers-by patronize these vendors.&nbsp; Only recently a new grocery opened up just down the block, by 81st Street. <br /><br />Please make your voices heard, requesting the removal of this vendor from our streets.&nbsp; Remember, this is likely the first of many to come....&nbsp; please email or call to complain:<br /><br />City Councilwoman Julissa Ferraras: 718 651 1917<br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm:&nbsp; 718 803 6373<br />115th Precinct: 718 533 2002<br />Community Board #3: 718 458 2707&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="mailto:communityboard3@nyc.rr.com" class="bbc_email">communityboard3@nyc.rr.com</a>

					Until yesterday, I had been very pleased with Lemon Tree grocery on the northwest corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; They actually aimed higher then many of our other businesses, and have an inviting store with great products.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since I live on 78th Street, I was severely disappointed when they chose to install a for-profit clothing donation box on a residential street.&nbsp; I walked into the store, did not see the man I assume is the owner, but one person inside did admit that they had it placed there.&nbsp; I explained that they are in a NYC-designated historic district, and they cannot install semi-permanent objects - like a donation box - on it.&nbsp; (Some of you may remember that thanks to the JHBG, Time Warner&#039;s illegal cable boxes were removed over a decade ago for the very same reason).&nbsp; <br /><br />Of couse, he could care less.&nbsp; I explained that I can no longer patronize a business that does not respect my block... or any block for that matter.&nbsp; So I will take my business elsewhere until is it removed.&nbsp; This condition has already been reported to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Councilmember Dromm.&nbsp; Objects like this do not belong on our streets, regardless of the block.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask you to walk into Lemon Tree and express your concern about their decision to install a for-profit clothing donation box.&nbsp; Ask them to remove it.&nbsp; Remember to always vote with your dollars.&nbsp; That is the only way our businesses will understand our expectations.&nbsp; Thank you.
