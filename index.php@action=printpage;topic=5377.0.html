				I&#039;m looking for anything from snacks to lunch in the vicinity of 75th and 37th (can walk a few blocks in either direction) that is very healthy - meaning not very salty, fatty or high in calories.<br /><br />All I can think of so far is:<br /><br />sashimi from Happy Kitchen<br />fresh sliced fruit from the fruit place across from Met Food<br />Greek yogurt from Met, Trade Fair or Italian Market<br />organic string cheese and soy chips from the Health Food store<br />$1 frozen yogurt from the salad bar place on 82nd St. in Elmhurst (is it really healthy?)<br /><br />Any other ideas?<br />Has anyone tried the chicken avocado salad from East 21?&nbsp; IS there a Chinese place that sells brown rice and steamed vegetables with no sauce?

				the rotisserie chicken at all-american (37th and 78th-ish) could fit the bill. they offer some healthy sides as well.<br /><br />pacific supermarket at 75th and broadway has some &#039;fake meat&#039; items in their refrigerator case by the register. if you like things like veggie duck, etc, you can get a nice selection (and some seaweed salad) for just a few bucks. <br /><br />

The text even says there was no evidence that Amin served rats. I can&#039;t believe it&#039;s 2010 and there&#039;s still jokes that Chinese restaurants in America serve cats and rats and dogs to unwitting customers. I mean, buying budget chicken is a lot cheaper and less time consuming than attempting to collect enough rats. Plus I imagine rats aren&#039;t very meaty.
