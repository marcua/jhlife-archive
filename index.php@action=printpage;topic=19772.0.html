				I couldn&#039;t find confirmation of this on a website anywhere, but I read on the JH Families Google group that Apna Bazaar is now closed for a week, although they are accepting phone orders of more than $50<br /><br />&quot;They are closed to in-store customers until April 8. But if you&#039;re buying $50 or more worth of groceries, you can call 718-565-5960 or 516-348-2061 ext 200 or email orderjackson@yahoo.com for in-store pick-up between 10am-6pm during April 1-7.&quot;<br /><br />Please make sure you confirm, as this is just one person&#039;s account.

				Hi All, To save anyone a trip to the health food store, the Organic Market on 37th/85th is closed &quot;until further notice&quot; the sign says. <br /><br />All the little pharmacies on 37th are closed. Franks is still open, thank goodness. And the larger drug stores are still open. I found bathroom cleaner at Rite Aid. They also had some off-brand Swiffer-type wet and dry still in stock, but no paper products. C-Town had Kleanex but no TP.<br /><br />I found TP at the little news/lotto shop near Taco Bell, of all places. The dollar store on 37th/86th had been my go-to in past weeks, but they are closed now too.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Mod note: this thread/post was similar to this existing thread, so it was merged.</strong>

Assuming the food has been thoroughly cooked, you&#039;re more likely to find active virus on the packaging it from the delivery person since the virus lives longer on non-porous surfaces and is most commonly spread person to person. All indications are that shopping in a store can be more hazardous than getting a delivery or picking up depending on how much close contact you have. Of course, they&#039;ve changed their mind about this virus before and I don&#039;t blame anyone for having an abundance of caution. The Verge had a recent article about this: https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/3/17/21183919/food-take-out-delivery-order-safe-restaurants-coronavirus

				On Monday I noticed signs on Cannelle Patisserie that they were reopening today 4/9, hours: M-Sat 8-5 &amp; Sunday 8-4. I can not confirm if it actually happened or not, so it&#039;s probably a good idea to call to confirm before you head over. :)<br />

				There&#039;s a risk with ordering food but I imagine waiting on line for a grocery store for an hour comes with a greater risk.

				Just Made 4 U seems to have closed--but is Emoji Burger still open? I think they are owned by the same people. Very sad about Just Made 4 U--one of the places we have ordered from often over the years.

				I was lucky enough to get access to a car for a few weeks.<br /><br />If you have a car, it&#039;s worth going to other neighborhoods to do your supermarket shopping.<br /><br />The lines at our supermarkets are interminable... and in places like Greenpoint and Williamsburg, there are practically no queues at all. <br /><br />(Talking about normal supermarkets like C TOWN etc. Not Wholefoods.)
