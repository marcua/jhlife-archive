				Welcome to the neighborhood and congrats on getting board approval.<br /><br />I have been in touch with NYSC in the past and they seemed interested in JH, but I think one thing in their way is locating an appropriate space.&nbsp; The one in Sunnyside is tiny compared to many other branches, so maybe they wouldn&#039;t mind have another small one here.

				Instead/in addition to Whole Foods, check out the local CSA http://www.farmspot.org/ (http://www.farmspot.org/) We did this last year and it was great. Also, on weekends in the warmer half of the year is the greenmarket around Travers Park, which is really great too. Great organic produce. <br /><br />I&#039;m with you on Trader Joe&#039;s, but it&#039;s not as big of a deal as I thought it might be once I got used to the stores here - other than TJ store brands, I find pretty much everything I need at one of the local grocery stores - many of which are open 24 hours (yes, you can find fresh herbs at 3 AM here)<br /><br />And the new wine store, Table Wine is a great addition to the neighborhood. They curate their collection well, so I don&#039;t worry about picking a bad wine...they don&#039;t stock any...so I try new things from them.&nbsp; <br /><br />For movies, if it&#039;s not at the Ziegfeld in Manhattan (Still my fave), we usually head over to the Kaufman Astoria 14 (right by the Steinway stop on the R/V trains, and sinfully close to the Panera Bread store there and the new Beer Garden) http://www.yelp.com/biz/ua-kaufman-astoria-stadium-14-astoria (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ua-kaufman-astoria-stadium-14-astoria). It&#039;s huge, with great sound and stadium seating and all the new releases in their digital 3-D goodness. <br /><br />I, too, would love to see a real bookstore (Borders would be nice, I don&#039;t know if an independent store can survive anymore in the age of Amazon..still, the B&amp;N in Forest Hills is only one express stop away. ) and a real gym (One that I can walk to that has air conditioning in Summer and is relatively clean). <br /><br />Welcome to the hood! Good luck with the move.

				Most Jackson Heights residents are against big box retailers.<br /><br />Jackson Heights is proud of its mom and pop businesses.<br /><br />As a resident of Jackson Heights for over 25 years, I resent Manhattanites that move here to save money on their residence.<br /><br />My family moved to Jackson Heights almost 40years ago as a step up from NYC Public Housing and had to pay $300 more in rent as compared to the $80 they paid in the past.<br /><br />Jackson Heights is a place for families to flourish with fast access to Manhattan, and small and cozy stores.<br /><br />The real estate agents who frequent this board will likely agree with me, because Jackson Heights has a charm about it that enables them to see coops rapidly.

				You are simply not allowed to want other stores here. You must find everything you need at the dollar stores/cellphone stores/vitamin stores/hoochie clothing stores! ;)<br /><br />All kidding aside, temporarily, the 99 cent stores are great for party supplies for your kids&#039; birthdays.

We lived in Park Slope for about 15 years prior and were able to watch the growth of <em><strong>locally owned and operated</strong></em> stores and amenities (it&#039;s funny that the only options offered here are &quot;what&#039;s here now&quot; or &quot;big box retailers&quot;, because that&#039;s not all there is), what is it about that growth that folks find so offensive in this neighborhood? <br /><br />We looked in Astoria, in Ditmas Park, in Kensington, Windsor Terrace, Forest Hills, Clinton Hill, Ft. Greene, Harlem, Washington Heights; what we liked about JH was the architecture, the people (the second &quot;scouting trip&quot; we made to the neighborhood we stopped to pet somebody&#039;s dog on the street and, when she found out we were apartment shopping, <strong>insisted</strong> we come look at her apartment, which wasn&#039;t for sale, so we could &quot;get an idea of what apartments here looked like&quot;. That NEVER happened in Brooklyn.) and how green the neighborhood was. What sold us on our apartment was it&#039;s pre war detailing; unlike your current clientele all of our renovation efforts have been to return it to as close to 1930&#039;s as possible - push button lighting, art deco light fixtures, etc. We may be leaning a little more towards &quot;bungalow&quot; rather than &quot;NY deco&quot;, but this was originally middle class housing (like the Aladdin/Sears/MontWard &#039;kit&quot; housing) and the time periods are concurrent, so we aren&#039;t sweating it that much.<br /><br />As far as supporting neighborhood businesses, I think I&#039;ve been pretty impartial in spreading purchases amongst Fawn and Colony, Table Wine is a great addition to the neighborhood and they&#039;re getting some of my hard earned jack as well. Jackson Heights Health Food gets a pretty fair portion as does Compare on Northern. But I guess Table Wine, JH Health Food and Espresso 77&nbsp; don&#039;t count since they&#039;re new interlopers, right? You can leave those out then. Mehfil, Rice Avenue, Arunee on occasion. But since most of the local restaurants don&#039;t have organic/local - beef/chicken/produce, we don&#039;t eat out in the neighborhood much. It&#039;s nice having a farmer&#039;s market part of the year, it would be great to have more organic options here plus, since I have to go to Union Square to buy beef, chicken and pork, it&#039;s easier for me to get everything else I want there. I&#039;m not sure why it makes me the spawn of evil to want that option in a more convenient location. Please do have a separate conversation about malls, I&#039;m trying to remember the last time I was in one. <br />I think it was 2004...

				&nbsp;Very few neighborhoods offer all the amenities that we&#039;d like to see but what is wonderful about living in NYC is that we have so many wonderful little neighborhoods that offer very specific stores. &nbsp;For example when I want great Greek and Italian food items I head over to Astoria while I&#039;m there I often grab a gyro or brick oven pizza and when I&#039;m looking for Polish food I pop over to Greenpoint where I often visit a favorite cafe for borscht.....I can go on and on but you get the idea. &nbsp;Look at it as an adventure and a time to get to know another neighborhood. &nbsp;I have a friend who lives in Astoria and orders her organic vegetables from http://www.urbanorganic.com/organic, they deliver and have great prices. &nbsp;As far as a bookstore goes I head over to the library and if they don&#039;t have what I&#039;m looking for they can get it for me in less than a week. &nbsp;By using the library I not only save money but I also don&#039;t have to worry about making space in my overcrowed bookshelf and I&#039;m also saving trees as well!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#039;s face it there are many neighborhoods in Manhattan that require a train ride to &quot;dream stores&quot; just as in JH the difference here is a great pre-war apartment for less than 1/2 the price! &nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy JH and all it&#039;s diversity.<br /><br />

				We moved here about 6 years ago.&nbsp; We really like the neighborhood--the interesting and the no so interesting.&nbsp; For restaurants this is one of the best neigborhoods in the city.&nbsp; Also, a nice mix of people/cultures.&nbsp; Do wish, however, there was a nice&nbsp; big and green public park.&nbsp; Wish there was an old, quiet Irish pub and maybe a bookstore.&nbsp; Maybe a few less banks on 82nd (I count five on one block!).&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; It&#039;s still a great place to live.&nbsp; Can&#039;t have everything.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed at how many artists/writers/musicians call this home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Wow! I didn&#039;t realize that my original post turned into a heated discussion and offended some people here since I have not checked the forum as I was dealing with the closing, final walk through, and all the good stuff...<br /><br />My husband and I have been looking for an apartment to buy for probably 2 years.&nbsp; We have been looking around at Washington Heights, Inwood, Williamsburg, park slope, long island city, Astoria.... you name it. <br /><br />What attracted us originally about Jackson Heights was the beautiful spacious pre-war apartments in the Historical area.&nbsp; We were so turned off by all the cookie cutter new developments with no personalities. The apartments in Jackson Heights were absolutely gorgeous!&nbsp; Inwood has some beautiful apartments, but even though it is still part of the Manhattan, the transportation just did not seem very convenient compare to Jackson Heights. <br />At one point last year, we practically spent every weekends in Jackson Heights looking for apartments.&nbsp; We walked up and down the 37th avenue numerous times and really enjoyed the neighborhood.&nbsp; Our first stop was always the Argentina Pastry shop for some coffee and pastries. We loved all the world cuisines we ate here, the Indian and Chinese supermarkets.... I found myself always looking forward to the trips to Jackson Heights, and the commute from and to Manhattan was a breeze. <br /><br />I for one did not like what was happening in Manhattan the past couple of years with banks and drug stores opening in every block.&nbsp; And all the new developments happening on the west side! It did not feel like New York at all. I thought Manhattan was losing it&#039;s charm and looked more and more like the rest of the America. <br /><br />Having said that, being a New Yorker, I love to walk every chance I get. <br />I enjoy being able to work out in a gym that is within walking distance to my apartment so that going to a gym does not need to be a big project. (All women would understand the challenge of getting all the facial/hair products, outfits together trying to incorporate gym into part of you day.) <br />On a lazy weekend when I am not in the mood to plan ahead and do anything particularly productive but doesn&#039;t feel like to stay home, I would take a short walk and spend an afternoon sitting in the bookstore cafe browsing through books and magazines or maybe go see a movie from the movie theater nearby. I was not so lucky on the organic market, I had to take a bus or subway for that one. <br /><br />Okay, so maybe I am being naive or spoiled... I really did not expect my wish of having the convenience of easy access to these things would cause such strong reactions and the horrible &quot;G&quot; debate.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love those mom and pop shops. I am excited to move to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; But I still would love to have movie theaters, Gyms, bookstore, and good organic market around.&nbsp; <br />I honestly thought people living in Jackson Heights will enjoy having the convenience of these things too.&nbsp; Boy, am I wrong. <br />But does it have to be one or another? It&#039;s like... can I say that I love my husband to death but he told bad jokes sometimes and I wish he eventually would learn to pick after his socks??<br /><br />If I move to Jackson Heights from Brooklyn and hoping for a good pizzeria in the neighborhood or if I come fresh out of the boat from another country and wanting an authentic home cooking restaurant, would it be less offensive? <br /><br />Anyway, peace and love, my soon to be neighbors! :)<br /><br />

				Welcome to the neighborhood yqc7487. &nbsp;Many of us are totally in agreement with you. &nbsp;We love Jackson Heights the way it is, but wouldn&#039;t mind having a little more variety and extra amenities in the neighborhood. &nbsp;I am with you, I rather walk and spend my money in my neighborhood than spend it outside of the neighborhood. &nbsp;Also, a lot of us do not have so much extra time and money that we can just travel all over New York to go to the gym or get a nice hormone free steak or other.<br /><br />That would be great if the Y comes to Jackson Heights. &nbsp;That would really fill a void. &nbsp;<br /><br />It would be great too if La Gamin came and then all the people who post anti-gentrification threads on this message board can stand outside staring in the window while I enjoy my wonderful crepe filled with nutella and banana with a glass of wine and cafe au lait while reading a book. &nbsp; ;D

				amen, jeff<br /><br />i&#039;ve lived in new york almost my entire life and i remember a time when there were actually neighborhoods with character. it seems like those who come here from elsewhere don&#039;t share a fondness for such singularity and want to ensure that every five block radius has a sushi bar, an organic bakery, a pet groomer, a wine shop, a cheese shop and a place to have botox injected. <br /><br />those who say &#039;i love jackson heights, i just want to change everything about it&#039;? let&#039;s put out the &#039;no vacancy&#039; sign now. fortunately, the neighborhood is not dominated by easily intimidated renters, who were bribed or burned out of other areas i&#039;ve lived in. it&#039;s hard to browbeat a homeowner out of their space, even if said homeowner wants more 99 cent stores, not fewer. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />and, for the record, i&#039;d welcome a bookstore and a branch of the Y. but not a Trader Joe&#039;s (so freakin&#039; overrated) or a usurious private gym<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4215.msg27833.html#msg27833">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on February 23, 2010, 09:49:09 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There goes the neighborhood.... <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m writing a letter to each to tell them to stay where they are.

				UM...<br />I don&#039;t think anyone was asking for a cheese shop, pet groomer or botox joint.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">it seems like those who come here from elsewhere don&#039;t share a fondness for such singularity and want to ensure that every five block radius has a sushi bar, an organic bakery, a pet groomer, a wine shop, a cheese shop and a place to have botox injected.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The request, which has been echoed many times on this board, was for a gym and a bookstore. And a movie theatre (we had two until this year, when they both went out of business).<br /><br />A bookstore seems like a pipe dream. Virtually all the independent bookstores in Manhattan have closed. (I was especially sad to see Applause books and Shakespeare &amp; Co go). B&amp;N and Borders only make half of their money from books...instead from cards, toys, cafe sales, etc. And now even the big guys are losing money:&nbsp; <em>Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders Bleed Red</em> http://www.thestreet.com/story/10631944/1/barnes-noble-borders-bleed-red.html (http://www.thestreet.com/story/10631944/1/barnes-noble-borders-bleed-red.html). They can&#039;t compete with Walmart, Amazon and digital downloads. If someone can figure out how to have a bookstore succeed, I&#039;d love to see it (and patronize it) but I think they&#039;re going the way of CD stores and Video Rental places...killed off by digital distribution.<br /><br />I too, would love to see a gym.<br /><br />Curves may be nice, but as a man, I&#039;m automatically excluded, and it&#039;s a mile walk from my house. Plus, I don&#039;t like the extreme right-wing political donations of the owner/ceo (I realize that franchisees may not share those views, but it&#039;s the largest chain of gyms in the world, and a lot of $$ is flowing through the CEO to political groups I strongly disagree with.)<br /><br />Multiple branches around the city are a plus. And some might not want to see a &quot;usurious private gym&quot; - rates at the Y are not particularly less expensive just because they&#039;re a not-for-profit.&nbsp; The Y in flushing has a $100 initiation, plus $58 monthly fee, but that doesn&#039;t include use of the Manhattan Y&#039;s, which have a monthly fee of $90. NYSC does the same one-club membership for $65, as does 24-hour fitness. Bally&#039;s is $35 a month (their sub-brand, Crunch is $90/month). The Powerhouse Gym in Corona, Rego Park&#039;s World Gym and a lot of the private gyms in Astoria charge around $50 a month. Gentrification Watch: Don&#039;t worry, the ritzy, Equinox/NYHRC/Crunch gyms won&#039;t be opening out here. <br />

				yqc<br />Welcome to the neighborhood.&nbsp; For me at least, there is NOTHING wrong with wishing for service &quot;A&quot; ( a good clean affordable gym), &quot;B&quot; (a movie theatre I can walk to) or &quot;C&quot;, but to wish for CHAIN/conglomerate a, b or c (which you yourself bemoaned taking all the life out of your soon to be former neighborhood) is what hurts.&nbsp; It broke my heart to see people jumping up and down with joy in Astoria when a Panera Bread opened up there, in one of the few neighborhoods left in the city with a different bakery on every corner.&nbsp; It&#039;s been hard to watch the city become a more and more difficult place to do business if you don&#039;t have a corporate parachute.&nbsp; Now we&#039;re stuck with the same 6 stores every 10 blocks in so many neighborhoods.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem like you can really have both.&nbsp; But people love the big box stores, that&#039;s why they are here.&nbsp; Enjoy the diversity of jackson Heights, and let&#039;s support the smaller stores- I DO believe(hope) this will provide incentive for new stores to fill the vacancies that have recently opened up.&nbsp; To me the chains reflect nothing of the neighborhood surrounding them....I&#039;ll get off my soapbox now- I know I&#039;ve said nothing new!

				Sad to say, we&#039;ll never get a book store. I&#039;m in publishing, and it&#039;s drying up. Bookstores are now the yuppie equivalent of high-end coffee shops 10 years ago, and it takes an affluent neighborhood to support one. But there is the guy who sells used books in front of the Met on 37th sometimes--though for the preservation of my own job I shouldn&#039;t be advocating used books. Buy new! If not from indies, then from publisher&#039;s websites! Thanks for helping me pay my mortgage...
