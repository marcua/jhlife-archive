					Please join Congressman Crowley, Assemblymember Moya, Council Members, and Make Queens Safer for a Pedestrian SafetyTown Hall this Sunday from 4-6PM. <br /><br />&nbsp;It will be at the Renaissance School. <br /><br />We have invited Reps from the 115 Precinct, the 108, DOT, DOE, Transportation Alternatives, and hopefully some PTA&#039;s or School Principals and hope that a series of questions and answers will help our community figure out how to Make Queens Safer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Our group, MQS has a focus on education. We don&#039;t understand why the Dept. of Ed wasn&#039;t included in the Mayor&#039;s Plan for Vision Zero. School safety is important, and our kids&#039; first steps to learning, should be safe first steps to school. <br /><br /><br /><br />Beyond that, there are issues of street re-design, safe routes, slow zones and the ever important need to educate both drivers and pedestrians about how to practice street safety. <br /><br /><br /><br />If you have questions, or even better, if you have answers, please join us. <br />

					<br /><br />Hi. A few weeks have passed since our Three Children Too Many March brought attention to the lack of police enforcement, and street calming devices in our neighborhood. The families we honored, who suffered the loss of a child due to reckless driving have received some of the attention they deserve in City politics and policy making. We are gearing up to a bigger campaign and invite you to follow us on facebook. The group is called Make Queens Safer. We will be working with Assemblyman Moya, and Council Members Dromm and Ferraras in the coming months in order to be in the forefront of the Pedestrian Safety movement that is coming to NYC. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Offer your suggestions, cite what needs fixing, or simply follow along, as we work to keep our loved ones safe on our streets and in our community. <br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/makequeenssafer" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/makequeenssafer</a><br />

					<br /><br />Hi Neighbors, <br /><br />A bunch of us are in the early organizing stages for a March, entitled &quot;Three Children too Many&quot; pedestrian injuries and death in our neighborhood. Information on that will be forthcoming in the next day or so. Please join us, it is important. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was researching things for the March, I came across a Meeting scheduled for Tomorrow to be held at Make the Road New York. I found the flyer at the Community Board 3 meeting on Thursday, and wanted to check a few things out before I posted. Here is the info from the flyer...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you need recreational space for Children? <br /><br />Are cars speeding through your blocks? <br /><br />How can you make your street safe and more comfortable??<br /><br />Play Streets<br /><br />Speed Cameras for school zones<br /><br />Street Design Improvements<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Let&#039;s mobilize your community to create safer, healthier and more vibrant streets. <br /><br />Tuesday, 10/22<br /><br />4 to 6PM. <br /><br />Make the Road New York<br /><br />92-10 Roosevelt Ave <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes!! Yes!!! Yes!!! I say...Let&#039;s get it all. But, it is so difficult to get information, this meeting would be perfect for us as a community. So, I contacted Transportation Alternatives and they will do this meeting again in November. If anyone can attend tomorrow, please do. There is a lot happening in Jackson Heights and we need to be aware of it, in order to be a part of the solutions! <br /><br />For example, did you know-<br /><br />*We can try to get funds and resources to have Northern Blvd deemed a &quot;Congested Corridor&quot;<br /><br />*Three schools in our neighborhood have been chosen for the Safe Routes to School program from DOT. Others are considered 2nd tier priority P.S. 69 among them. <br /><br />*JH has been chosen for a neighborhood Slow Zone, but the area currently covered just isn&#039;t big enough<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This is an informational post for you. If you would like to get involved we will be organizing as Three Children too Many. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our first goal is the March, and like I mentioned, someone is going to post about it soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our second goal is campaigning for safer streets, and the meeting mentioned above will really help us create a vision and find the proper resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Please let me know if anyone can make it tomorrow. <br /><br />We will have a separate yahoo group for Three Children too Many, so as not to burden this listserve in the future. <br /><br />Thanks for your time. I hope this interests you all. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Reply
