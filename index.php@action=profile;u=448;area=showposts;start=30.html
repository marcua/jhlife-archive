					Hello folks,<br />&nbsp;<br />Good news! The very much awaited art classes are here! <br />I would love to hear from you if you are interested in in enrolling your child, if the hours work for you etc...I will follow shortly with additional information, web site and precise starting date. <br />&nbsp;<br />Background:<br />&nbsp;<br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (The Jewish Center) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br />&nbsp; <br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br />&nbsp; <br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br />&nbsp; <br />Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will start in October.&nbsp; They will run parallel to the public school schedule. Additional classes may be offered during the holidays while the kidâ€™s ore out of school.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will run Mon-Thursday. Length of classes: 1 hour&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. After School: 2 classes each afternoon: 3:15-4:15, or 4:30-5:30. Classes are divided into ages:&nbsp; 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 <br />&nbsp;2. Morning Toddlers (with parents or nannies), ages 3-4: 10:00AM-11:00AM, 11:15AM to 12:15AM. <br />&nbsp; <br />Subjects to explore throughout the year: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. Techniques in drawings <br />&nbsp;2. Painting techniques <br />&nbsp;3. Sumi drawing <br />&nbsp;4. Collage techniques <br />&nbsp;5. Sculpture and 3-d <br />&nbsp;6. Puppet making. <br />&nbsp;7. Bookmaking classes (with parents) <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Charge: The charge is $15 for a one-hour class. The monthly fee is $60.<br />Materials included.<br />&nbsp; <br />Deborah Wasserman&#039;s biography:<br />&nbsp;<br />Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and raised in Israel, Deborah Wasserman is currently living and working in Queens, NY.&nbsp; She is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program.&nbsp; Deborah Wasserman has received grants from the Experimental Television Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Aljira Center for the Arts and the America-Israel cultural foundation. Her work has been exhibited in the USA, Brazil, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel, in such venues as The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Tel Aviv Museum of the Arts, The World Wide Video Festival, White Columns, Gale Gates Gallery, GenArt and A.I.R gallery.<br />&nbsp;<br />To see my teaching resume, please go to my we site at:<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html</a><br /><br />Looking forward to working together,<br />&nbsp;<br />Deborah<br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.deborahwasserman.com</a> &lt;http://www.deborahwasserman.com&gt; <br /><br />If you would like to enroll your child, please contact me at: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br /><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />

To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (The Jewish Center) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br />&nbsp; <br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br />&nbsp; <br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br />&nbsp; <br />Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will start in October.&nbsp; They will run parallel to the public school schedule. Additional classes may be offered during the holidays while the kidâ€™s ore out of school.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will run Mon-Thursday. Length of classes: 1 hour&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. After School: 2 classes each afternoon: 3:15-4:15, or 4:30-5:30. Classes are divided into ages:&nbsp; 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 <br />&nbsp;2. Morning Toddlers (with parents or nannies), ages 3-4: 10:00AM-11:00AM, 11:15AM to 12:15AM. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Subjects to explore throughout the year: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1.

					Hello everybody!!!<br /><br />A workout group has started a week ago in Traver&#039;s park.&nbsp; Leading us is a very experienced and incredible trainer (his name is Kiki) who worked with me before.&nbsp; You will see and experience results very fast (from my own experience). We do some cardiovascular and we exercise almost every part of our bodies.&nbsp; It&#039;s not too hard, but it&#039;s also not too easy. It is perfectly fit to your level!.&nbsp; The goal is to help everyone (whatever level, age) to get fit, lose weight and feel GREAT! Working out in the fresh air really makes you feel so energized and satisfied.<br /><br />This is our second week and we already have a set schedule for next week.&nbsp; We will stick to this schedule until more people will join.&nbsp; Then we will open up more classes.&nbsp; All of you are welcome to come by, try it out (first trial class is for free), and join!<br /><br /><br />Weekly schedule:<br /><br />Monday Evenings at 7:15PM-8:15PM<br /><br />Wednesday mornings at: 10:00AM-11:00AM<br /><br />Saturday mornings at&nbsp; 12:00PM-1:00PM<br /><br />Sunday mornings at: 10:00AM-11:00AM<br /><br />The price for each class is $15.&nbsp; You can purchase class cards.&nbsp; A 12 class card comes with 2 bonus classes. <br /><br />Please remember not to eat two hours prior to class.&nbsp; Drinking a smoothie or a protein drink two hours prior to working out is a great idea!<br /><br />Please bring along: A jumping rope, water and yoga mats. Do wear good shoes so you don&#039;t harm your feet. If you do not have all this equipment, come with whatever you have.&nbsp; we change locations in the park according to whatever activity is taking place.&nbsp; we will be recognized easily, though.<br /><br /><br />Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at 10:00AM and next week on Mon evening and Wed morning.<br /><br />If you are interested, please email me and let me know when you think you can attend, or just show up.&nbsp; I am just helping Kiki organize this and keep track of the students, schedule etc...<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Deborah<br /><a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br />

					Hey there!<br /><br />I went to the first meeting and wanted to share it with you guys.&nbsp; The person who will be running the meetings is named Hector Canonge.&nbsp; He is a contemporary, conceptual artists and quite sharp.&nbsp; I think he is capable of doing a lot for this community (especially because he is familiar with our needs, being a Queens artist himself).<br /><br />We basically brainstormed for about two hours and talk about our needs and &quot;Wish List&quot;.&nbsp; We discussed everything from exhibition opportunities, to money, grants, collaborative projects, performance art, publishing a magazine, renting studio spaces and forming a community.<br /><br />We are going to start with a list serve, a blog and stay connected via the internet. There will be a lot more to do and discuss over the next meetings. I see the importance of this opportunity tied to the idea that it&#039;s a lot easier to&nbsp; progress when you have a non for profit organization behind you, as your &quot;Umbrella&quot; organization.&nbsp; This way you have more access to resources and sometimes - less bureaucracy.&nbsp; It seems like QMAD has some tools to help us out as a community and as individual artists, and also-They are eager to help.<br /><br />I recommend for everyone to join and try to attend the next meeting.<br /><br />We are so lucky that the meetings take place here, in JH, and that we have our JH arts group too. These two&nbsp; complement each other beautifully.&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that in a year or two, this community will be thriving!!!<br /><br />Good night everybody and hope to see ye on Sunday!<br />debs
