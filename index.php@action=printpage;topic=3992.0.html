				Does anyone remember seeing Led Zep,Pink Floyd,The Doors and other rock movies there at midnight in the 1970&#039;S? These were the good old days when you could smoke pot or cigarettes and nobody would say anything. I remember not being able to see the guy&#039;s head in front of me because of the smoke from the bongs,gas masks,<br />pipes and cigarettes. How times have changed!<br />

				In 1961 Chubby Checker made a live appearance at the Boulevard Theatre in conjunction with some movie about the Twist. (this was a MAJOR dance craze in the 60&#039;s and the place went wild). <br /><br />Way back then the neighborhood movie theatres used to have &quot;matrons,&quot; older women with flashlights, who kept order. Hard to believe that a 5&#039;0&quot; 70 year old woman armed only with a flashlight could keep order in a movie theatre filled with hundreds of kids and teenagers but they did.&nbsp; <br /><br />Different times. <br /><br />&nbsp;
