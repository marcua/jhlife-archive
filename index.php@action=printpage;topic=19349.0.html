				Is it my imagination, or is the honking in the neighborhood just getting worse and worse and worse?&nbsp; Fridays after work it is almost unbearable.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Why is everyone honking their horns?&nbsp; There used to be &quot;No honking&quot; signs in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Bring them back!

				Major pet peeve of mine! Random honking here is prevalent. Sometimes I engage the driver in <br />conversation and ask with genuine curiosity why they think honking will help. They often say <br />they are in a hurry, need to get home, something like this but it&#039;s seems to be that they honk<br />because they can - no one tells them not to and it lets off a bit of their frustration as drivers<br />and wakes up any napping babies along with irritating the sh#% out of the rest of us.<br />&nbsp;<br />I do think it contributes to accidents as it makes drivers nervous and wish the insurance companies<br />would somehow calculate it into the rates, like they do with that device that registers how much<br />you are braking.<br />

				Vision zero is blame. <br />Politicians making a stink, then haphazardly delaying red lights to allow pedestrians to cross.<br /><br />It was all done very poorly. There is no rhyme or reason to which streets have a delay and which do not. So two problems happen. <br /><br />1) pedestrians take advantage and always walk into int the street because they now think they have an extra 10 seconds to cross. <br /><br />2) the lights are no longer timed properly for drivers.&nbsp; So the drivers are rewarded by gunning it down the street in order to make the next light.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				The problem is alway horrible on Friday evenings around 5PM in this neighborhood because that&#039;s when the idiotic Dept of Sanitation decides their trucks should come around to pick up the recyclables. Why the recyclables need to sit on the sidewalk for a full day before getting picked up is anyone&#039;s guess. They are put out Thursday evening and could be picked up in the mornings along with the regular trash, but no... they sit there all day until the Friday evening rush hour, so I don&#039;t really blame drivers for losing their patience.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19349.msg95761.html#msg95761">Quote from: hum@njukebox1 on September 13, 2019, 05:24:47 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Fridays after work it is almost unbearable.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Why is everyone honking their horns? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&quot;1) pedestrians take advantage and always walk into int the street because they now think they have an extra 10 seconds to cross.&quot;<br /><br />Pedestrians with the walk signal have the right of way. The fact that you think they are &quot;taking advantage&quot; shows how out of touch you are with reality and how disrespectful you are of your neighbors trying to cross the street.

				I’m talking about the haphazardly delayed lights. The ones where the pedestrian walking signal stops, But people still go.&nbsp; because they think the green light for the driver won’t go for another 10 seconds. <br /><br />Problem is all the lights in JH have not been vison zeroed. So it’s random and several lights still turn green the instant that walk sign stops.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So you have a lot of honking drivers. <br /><br />You can choose not to believe me.&nbsp; But it’s my opinion.&nbsp; I think in today’s world I’m still allowed an opinion

				80JHer, my mistake, I thought you were talking about some intersections having LPI&#039;s (leading pedestrian interval) where the pedestrian signal changes to walk about 10-15 seconds before the light turns green for vehicles, and referencing the ones that do not have this as the problem. <br /><br />You are most certainly entitled to express your opinion as we all are. <br /><br />

				People honk for the dumbest and most idiotic reasons. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been honked at as a driver by the driver behind me for not plowing through pedestrians in the cross walk. Yep, their lives are far less important than that guy&#039;s need to get through the intersection without any delay. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been honked at by other drivers who 1.) didn&#039;t understand that signaling and pulling over in front of an empty space on the street meant I was going to park, and 2.) are such bad drivers that they couldn&#039;t steer the more than adequate amount of space between my economy sized car and the cars on the other side of the street.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been honked at for double parking on a side street, putting my hazards on, and helping an elderly person get in to my car.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been honked at for doing the speed limit. One delightful driver also also flashed his lights at me, and then after we had passed the BQE overpass, passed me on 34th Avenue. The kicker - there was a VisionZero bumper sticker on the car that said &quot;Your Choices Matter. VisionZero.&quot;

				Most of the honking occurs on side streets. The reason is persistent double parking on 37th Avenue. This makes it very difficult to turn from the side streets onto the avenue. Drivers get stuck waiting through several lights, get peeved and think that by honking that will move traffic.

				There&#039;s a snitching app for citizens to report illegal parking to city (i think it&#039;s only in NJ). I think that idea better serves to report the freaking honking AND extended double parking in this neighborhood. I agree it&#039;s mostly double parking but sometimes people are way too trigger happy with the honking though and will honk nonstop if someone is just delayed moving at a green for 5 seconds.&nbsp;

				As I was walking home from work late this afternoon along 37th Avenue, one guy was driving his car down the street, honking his horn over and over and over.&nbsp; I could see no reason why he was doing so.&nbsp; &nbsp;
