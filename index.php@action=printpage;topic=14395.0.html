				At least the coffee part is open now, great coffee, great pastries. The coffee is fair trade and roasted in Brooklyn (http://devocion.com/pages/our-story), they also will sell beans. It feels as warm and welcoming as the wine shop across the street.<br />I can&#039;t wait until the wine and tapas service starts!

				Went to Addictive Coffee (87th street off Northern Blvd) had delicious spinach and tomato. quiche and a latte. Great relaxing space. Once they get their liquor license (soon) they will open in the evening as a Tapas Bar serving food, wine and craft beer. The owners are really nice guys, Patrick and Francisco and they have the wine store across the street.<br /><br />Go check it out.

				Love your place. A cut above the rest. <br /><br />I can&#039;t drink your Toro coffee, tho. I had Louis add a jigger of water, and it was still way too much for my messed up digestive system. I was &quot;not well&quot; for two days. If it is always Toro that you sell by the cup, what would you suggest for me? <br /><br />I would like to recommend a tapas for your menu, a warm artichoke (I think) dip. I used to find it in wine bars in Manhattan.<br /><br />And the woman barista has fantastic eyebrows.<br /><br />Everyone, this place is on 87th, just north of Northern.

				Dear neighbors, <br /><br />We are honored and humbled that Bon Appétit were at Addictive Coffee yesterday and ordered a matcha green tea latte, they post it on their Instagram and we got over 10,000 likes and counting! We can&#039;t wait for you to try it. Happy Monday!&nbsp; <br /><br />*I have attached a screenshot of the picture. Please notice, I reduced the size, so the quality of the picture is off.

				I had the matcha green tea latte at Addictive Coffee on Saturday, it was fantastic, not too strong or too weak just right. My son had the Hot chocolate, which was out of this world. It&#039;s really more than a hot chocolate more like an old fashion hot cocoa, and it had the perfect amount of sweetness, not too much. These are both great alternatives if you are not a coffee drinker.

				The interior is really nice, just like their wine store--they&#039;ve done a terrific job. Seems like there&#039;s a lot of good stuff on Northern Boulevard these days. But the name always strikes me as a bit weird. And I&#039;m curious why they don&#039;t offer any decaf options (because they are insufficiently addictive??). <br /><br />Also, my drip coffee was served lukewarm.&nbsp; That&#039;s a big no-no.
