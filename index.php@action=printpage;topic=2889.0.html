				Hi Cindy. &nbsp;Jackson Heights currently has no dog park, but there is one in the works! &nbsp;You can read more about it at JH Dog Run in the Works! (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1017.0)<br /><br />In the meantime, there are some good suggestions on local dog runs from other JHL members on Where do you exercise/socialize your dog? (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=106.0)<br /><br />Your post doesn&#039;t mention your dog&#039;s size, but we recently had another member post about organizing a small dog play group. &nbsp;Read more about the Small Dog Play Group (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2723.0).

				There isn&#039;t one right now. However, one is in the works, thanks to years of work by many in the community. It&#039;s planned to be built on the north side of 35th Avenue at 69th Street, under the rail overpass. There&#039;s an existing thread on this site with much more detail: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1017 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1017)<br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve created a site to serve as an information clearing house (and possible dog park info/event site, if it&#039;s wanted) here: http://jhdogs.ning.com/ (http://jhdogs.ning.com/)<br /><br />Currently we take our dog to the park in woodside (but there&#039;s rarely anyone there) in Doughboy park, or up to Laguardia Landing Lights park (open fields, no fence - but an official off-leash-after-9PM NYC Park)<br />

				Thank you so much for the help! <br />my dog is about 24 pounds but she&#039;s kind of chunky and needs to lose some pounds for her size. <br /><br />Thanks again! i&#039;ll try to go to the parks mentioned :)
