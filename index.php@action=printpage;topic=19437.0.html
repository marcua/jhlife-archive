				I&#039;m a 40 year-old professional working remotely as a full-time employee of a Boston digital agency. I&#039;ve been with the same company for 2 years, and prior to that, I was with another company for 16 years. My company&#039;s HR department would be happy to confirm, and I can supply pay-stubs if requested.<br /><br />I&#039;m 2 years-divorced (hence the 40 year-old looking for a roommate) and relocating to the city to be closer to my partner. I&#039;m a non-smoker, have no pets (but I love animals), mostly-tidy, have a small &quot;footprint&quot; and good boundaries, but I&#039;m definitely not a recluse. <br /><br />I spend most of my day at the office (also looking for a co-working space if you know of one!). During my evenings at home, I tend to keep to myself reading quietly, watching videos, chatting with roommates, etc. I love cooking and baking (and sharing meals!), but I know how to keep to myself in the kitchen if that&#039;s the vibe. Being new to the area, I would love to meet more people and make new friends.<br /><br />Looking to move within the next three months. Please message me via the forum and we can go from there.<br /><br />Thank you! Looking forward to living in this awesome community soon!<br /><br />Eric
