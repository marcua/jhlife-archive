					I&#039;ve found the appetizer ka-chori at two different indian restaurants in different cities, and both times, the product description is &quot;too difficult to put into words but highly recommended&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a vegetarian appetizer, sort of like a chaat, with some type of fried patties, covered with chick peas and various sauces.&nbsp; I like to dump mango chutney on top of it all.&nbsp; I believe it&#039;s considered Northern Indian.<br /><br />I know where to find it in NYC (Baluchi&#039;s), but what about in JH?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen it on a menu here yet, but perhaps I&#039;m missing it.&nbsp; While it&#039;s great that I can order it for delivery to work, I do prefer to stuff myself with indian food in private:).

					I received a card in the mail for RCN Cable and Internet Service for $59.99 per month.&nbsp; I went to the website and see that a 12-month contract is required and equipment is not included.&nbsp; To get a TIVO/digital cable box, it would be an extra $19.95 per month.&nbsp; They recommend you buy your own cable modem for the internet, and I see I can purchase one for around $50 on Amazon.&nbsp; So, let&#039;s say this would make the monthly cost of a 1 year contract approximately $85.00.<br /><br />My 2-year contract with Time Warner Cable ended a few months ago, and the cost of my cable/internet and DVR is now $135 a month.&nbsp; When I called about the price increase (previously the bill was about $115 per month), they did not seem too concerned about it and didn&#039;t offer any kind of discount or try to get me to enter into a new contract.&nbsp; Generally, I&#039;m happy with my TWC cable and internet, and I love the DVR.&nbsp; No HD, and I don&#039;t want it.&nbsp; In actuality, I have way more channels than I need, as all I watch are the basic 1-11 channels, E!, Bravo, VH1 and MTV.&nbsp; I&#039;d have no problem if my channels only went up to channel 25, but I do like the channel guide, and I do love my DVR.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering this switch to lower my monthy cost, but I just wanted to check to see if others had an opinion on RCN.&nbsp; Are there hidden fees I am not aware of?&nbsp; Are there installation costs (i really just did a quick look at the website)?&nbsp; Does the internet/ cable frequently go out?&nbsp; Is TIVO as good as a DVR?<br /><br />OR, has anyone had any luck getting TWC to significantly lower their prices if I&#039;m considering switching?&nbsp; I am not aware of any package that will give me only the channels I want, but if there is a way and you have negotiated it, please let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to enter into another 2-year contract if I need to.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want their digital phone, and I&#039;m annoyed that you can&#039;t call up TWC without them offering it!<br /><br />Now, just waiting for my Verizon cell phone contract to run out so that I can find a way to stop paying them $70 a month... <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					With all the great Mexican restaurants around here, there must be one that makes guacamole tableside... I haven&#039;t explored as much as I should have by now, but every time I go out for Mexican around here, I just seem to get a little cup of mashed avocado (no tomatoes, onions, ciliantro, etc).&nbsp; Perhaps that is authentic...&nbsp; but, does anyone know of a place around here where guacamole is made tableside with all the fixings?

					I&#039;ve been in need of a massage for awhile, and I&#039;ve been passing this place and meaning to stop in. &nbsp;The blizzard altered my plans for today and I found myself nearby with some free time. &nbsp;<br /><br />The name of the place is &quot;Magic Spa N.Y. Inc. and it&#039;s located right near the 61st Street 7 train stop in Woodside. &nbsp;I believe the most prominent sign from the outside says &quot;Chinese Body Work&quot;. &nbsp;There are curtains on the door so that you can&#039;t see in, but I never see anyone walk in there and I think it&#039;s because they are not well-known.<br /><br />They advertise &quot;walk-ins welcome&quot;, so I walked right in and asked for a 60-minute massage. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think they speak English very well over there, but I had no problem communicating my basic request. &nbsp;I was led into a small curtained area. &nbsp;The place is no-frills, but was clean and quiet. &nbsp;I did not hear any background noise during the entire massage, despite the lack of real walls. &nbsp;<br /><br />My massage therapist was a man named George. &nbsp;He put on some relaxing music, and showed me the timer to confirm the 60 minutes I requested. &nbsp;The massage was very relaxing. &nbsp;At times I felt the pressure was a little bit much, but I chose not to say anything because I think he was working out some major knots I had in my shoulders and lower back. &nbsp;<br /><br />The best part--the price: &nbsp;$48 for an hour-long massage. &nbsp;Their menu shows that you can do a 15-minute for as little as $18 and it goes up to $92 for a 2-hour long. &nbsp;They also offer acupuncture, hot stone massage and foot reflexology. &nbsp;I will definitely be back!<br /><br />Magic Spa NY Inc.<br />61-15 Woodside Avenue<br />Woodside, NY 11377<br />718-424-8081

					I&#039;m reasonably certain that JH does not have one, but can anyone recommend a comedy club that&#039;s easy to get to from JH and not overrun by tourists?&nbsp; It seems that the only options are way way downtown in Manhattan, and i really dislike traveling that far late at night.<br /><br />I know of Mezzo in Astoria, but it appears to only have shows on Wednesday nights for some reason.&nbsp; I&quot;m looking to go tonight--Saturday.&nbsp; Queens (not too far out) or midtown Manhattan.

					I&#039;m thinking of moving to Manhattan when my lease is up in September (I love my apt and the food in Queens, but it&#039;s really quite lonely, as my friends are all in Manhattan).&nbsp; I&#039;ve just switched jobs, and have a few questions about what I would qualify for, and I hope someone knows the answer:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; My 2009 W-2 will show my old salary (about $10K less), but I can prove my current income via paystubs and my offer letter.&nbsp; Is this acceptable, or does the 40x rule apply to your prior year W-2 income?&nbsp; I just went from one job to the other (no gaps in employment) if this helps.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; My offer letter states a bonus amount, to be paid in February 2011, and so this would add to my yearly income.&nbsp; Since it hasn&#039;t been paid yet, I have no proof of this income via W-2s or paystubs, but I can show my offer letter that states this.&nbsp; Would I be able to apply this as my yearly income for the 40x rule?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; I&#039;d really prefer to live alone.&nbsp; Is it possible to find a large studio or 1 BR in the $1800 range, anywhere in Manhattan (far east or west ok, but Harlem/Wash heights, etc. is not).&nbsp; If I find a roommate, is it possible to get an apartment with 2 full bathrooms for $3600-$3800?<br /><br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; And if anyone knows (or is) a real estate agent who thinks they could help, please let me know.

					I parked my car on 41st Ave b/w 67th and 68th Street on Sunday on the side of the road where alternative side of street parking would require me to move my car on Friday.&nbsp; Normally, I&#039;d leave it there until then, but ended up driving the ten blocks to my gym because of the extreme cold yesterday (Tuesday).&nbsp; Under my windshield wipers and all the other cars on the street was a bright yellow flyer stating &quot;TOW AWAY ZONE NO PARKING 6AM TO 5PM WEDNESDAY&quot;&nbsp; It just said Wednesday (no date) and said &quot;The City of New York Department of Environmental Protection&quot; on the bottom.<br /><br />Does anyone know if this is a legitimate flyer?&nbsp; Had I not gone to my car as planned, would they have towed my car on Wednesday?&nbsp; I just don&#039;t see how flyers can suddenly appear on cars giving a day or two notice that the car needs to be moved.&nbsp; As far as I can see, there is no kind of environmental hazard on that road?&nbsp; I came back around 7pm on Tuesday night, and it didn&#039;t look like cars had cleared out.
