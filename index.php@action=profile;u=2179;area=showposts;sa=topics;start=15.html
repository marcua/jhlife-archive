					Last night was really bad trying to get around the neighborhood. Nothing was moving except me, barely. It was difficult getting around since nothing was shoveled or plowed. You couldn&#039;t really find trampled paths last night.<br /><br />With snow up to my knees, no path and the high winds it took about 20 minutes to walk from Roosevelt up to 35th Avenue. I noticed sparks and fire balls falling from the #7 before they shut it down.<br /><br />Today the streets are still unplowed or salted. Not all the sidewalks are cleared yet. I saw an 18 wheeler stuck at 77th and 37th. A heavy DOS salt truck with plow came to push him out and they got stuck too. Eventually after a good long time both were gone. Seems like the City dropped the ball with this storm.<br /><br />Where are our local photograhers? I&#039;ll bet there are hundreds of great shots waiting to be taken in the neighborhood and gardens.

					Tonight I was walking my dog. Suddenly and for no apparent reason another dog that was a good distance away made a quick lunge and wanted to attack my dog. Nothing new right? The other dog was able to get to us because it was on one of those retractable 25&#039; cord leashes which of course was unlocked, while the owner was busy daydreaming.<br /><br />Another time I was trying to get to an appointment and again there was a dog on one of those contraptions. The owner was at the curb, another daydreamer, while the dog was busy sniffing at the building&#039;s fence. It wasn&#039;t until I stopped and shot a look at the walker that they even became conscious. We shouldn&#039;t have to play hop scotch to get up the street.<br /><br />Fellow dog owners, <em>please,</em> you aren&#039;t doing your dog, yourself, or the public any favors by using those things. There are too many dangers that can happen in a split second. We&#039;re all better off, and safer, if you stick by the law which says no more than a 6&#039; leash.<br /><br />My dog walks on a 4&#039; strap which means he is close to me at all times and i think we&#039;re both happier for it. Your dog doesn&#039;t need to be wandering all over.<br /><br />Anyone else ever have a bad experience with one of those things?<br />

					According to the book &quot;JH A Garden in the City,&quot; Karatzas says that there were plans to build the last grand set of buildings on the site of what is now The Berkely; 78 &amp; 77 Streets and bordering on 35th Avenue. They were to outshine The Towers.<br /><br />Does anyone have further information on this? It would be interesting if there are plans or sketches to see what exactly they had in mind and what was never built.

					I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t a new thought at all, but it may be time to revive it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading the comments in the thread, &quot;New Building to Come - 84-01 37th Avenue.&quot; There are several remarks about what happened before the Historic District at the corner of 82nd &amp; 37th. Then the remarks about what has happened on 75th.<br /><br />It&#039;s time to get the boundaries of the district extended!<br /><br />There are plenty of charming old buildings which may not have been built by Queensboro Corporation and Mac Dougal, BUT they were subject in design to his exacting standards. These buildings deserve to be protected as well. I should also point out there are a number of buildings that are protected within the district that are of no significant architectural or historical value.<br /><br />Does anyone agree? <br />

					This is not a rant but a compliment along with a suggestion.<br /><br />There doesn&#039;t seem to be enough trash cans in the neighborhood. Maybe you&#039;ll find some on 37th Avenue but nothing on 34th or 35th. As a dog owner who does pick up you have to wonder what to do with the little package. I believe in keeping things clean, I live here. And I think more people would be conscious of &quot;doggie bags&quot; (or even making them!) and other forms of litter if they had a place to put it.<br /><br />One very thoughtful super at the Jefferson (78-12 35th) leaves a large hefty bag on the railing by the side doors on 78th and 79th streets. We make sure to pass there on our walk. I&#039;ve seen other dog walkers doing the same as well as people depositing other refuse while passing by.<br /><br />THREE CHEERS FOR HIM!&nbsp; <br /><br />Now if other buildings would do the same perhaps the streets would be nicer and the super&#039;s job easier. Has anyone ever suggested this to their management or at their board meetings?<br /><br />
