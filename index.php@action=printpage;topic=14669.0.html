				“Elliman Report: Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Sales”<br /><br />We have just released the first quarter 2016 “Elliman Reports” for the Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess <span class="bbc_u"><strong>sales markets</strong></span>; the leading resources on the state of these markets. We are proud to add Northwest Queens to our expanding coverage area. As always, our market reports are produced in conjunction with Miller Samuel to provide you and your clients with the most comprehensive and neutral market insight available.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Brooklyn housing market continued to outperform the other boroughs with rising prices and sales as well as falling inventory. The market moved at the fastest pace in nearly eight years. Rising demand and falling supply, in addition to a strong city economy continued to keep the pressure on housing prices.<br />&nbsp;<br />After setting a blistering pace in the second half of last year, the Queens housing market eased somewhat in the first quarter. Despite the decline in closed sales and rising inventory, contract signings jumped which suggests a strong spring market in front of us. In our new report, housing prices in Northwest Queens continued to rise.<br />&nbsp;<br />First quarter sales in Westchester county reached their second highest level in over a decade. More and more homebuyers who are priced out of the city, especially in Brooklyn, are looking to the region as an affordable alternative.<br />&nbsp;<br />Like Westchester, the Putnam county housing market had a lot of sales activity during the first quarter. Inventory could not keep up with sales so home prices increased.<br />&nbsp;<br />Like much of the region, Dutchess county home sales were high. Inventory grew at a faster rate than sales, which kept prices short of last year’s results.<br />&nbsp;<br />At Douglas Elliman, we are constantly looking for ways to provide our clients with better information, empowering them to make more informed decisions. Our efforts to create this market report series reflect our strong belief that access to timely information is a vital resource in a market that is constantly changing. Committed to providing the best information in the industry, we are proud to offer this service to our clients.
