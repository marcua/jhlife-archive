				You&#039;re not going to find fresh beans in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The one time I bought beans at Espresso 77&nbsp; they were older than my Grammar School tie (read that as probably older than you).&nbsp; Same goes for Lemon Tree and the alleged &#039;supermarkets&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been buying from Intelligentsia in Chicago (https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com) for about 8- 10&nbsp; years now.<br />Buy just enough, based on your use pattern to justify the shipping ($5 for 6 12oz bags).&nbsp; <br /><br />You might find this link helpful:&nbsp; http://www.talkaboutcoffee.com/coffee-storage.html<br /><br /><br />If you&#039;re not into web ordering, they have a cafe/retail shop near Macy&#039;s in Manhattan (I think 7th Ave and 36th).<br /><br />Just curious, what grinder(s) and brewer(s)/steeper(s),&nbsp; infuser(s) are you using?<br /><br />Good Luck On Your Quest...Grasshopper.<br />

They stamp the roast date on the bag (usually a week or two old at the latest) so you can check -- no need to be surprised. They&#039;re from Gimme, which is one of the better small batch roasters in the country. It&#039;s not on the level of Intelligensia, but they&#039;re significantly cheaper when you factor in shipping plus you&#039;re supporting a local business. Plus if enough of us buy beans at E77 they&#039;l have to replenish more quickly.

				agreed re: Espresso 77- take a few minutes and go through the stamped &quot;roasted on&quot; dates before you buy, because generally there&#039;s a pretty wide range of dates among the bags for sale. While some will be quite old, I can usually find something roasted within the past two weeks or so.

				I&#039;ve tried the beans all over the city - go to Puerto Rican coffee - they have a few locations - not only are they very fresh, but the price is one of the best.&nbsp; Well worth the trip.

				I know they have gourmet roasted beans at italian farms and lemon tree, though regarding freshness and dates i have no clue.<br /><br />Used to love going to porto rico coffe in the village.&nbsp; That was one fine smelling store

				I&#039;m not a coffee drinker, so I&#039;ll plead ignorance on quality.<br /><br />But there are a number of local roasters here in Queens:<br />Baruirs (http://www.yelp.com/biz/baruirs-coffee-sunnyside)<br />Native Coffee Roasters (https://www.facebook.com/nativeroasters/info?tab=page_info)<br />Eldorado Coffee Roasters (http://eldoradocoffee.com/)<br /><br />And here&#039;s a shop featuring beans from small roasters all over the country:<br />Astoria Coffee (http://www.astoriacoffeeny.com/roasters/)

I like the coffee, but the dispensers are not well serviced by whoever services the display (the store employees or distributor). For awhile I too was thinking the coffee was awful, but came to realize that the beans in the bin were wrongly placed there. Only when the bin was refilled with fresh beans was I able to make a comparison, and it was very obvious that I had been drinking something that I never would have knowingly purchased. <br /><br />Perhaps that is what happened to you, JH3525. At any rate, for the coffee bin of my choice, the problem for now is fixed.

				Digging up this old thread because we now have a place in our hood that you know how fresh your beans are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Addictive Coffee sells beans that show their roast date.&nbsp; See pics.<br /><br />BTW, their coffee is very good!&nbsp; Strong, a bit pricey ($3.25 for a large), but very good.

				Addictive Coffee and a quick jaunt down to Sunnyside to Baruir&#039;s would be my suggestion. I lived in Sunnyside for awhile, and walking by Baruir&#039;s when they were roasting coffee was always a delight.
