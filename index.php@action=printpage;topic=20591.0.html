				Councilmember Francisco Moya covers 82nd Street, not Councilmember Dromm.&nbsp; So if you have concerns about the conditions on 82nd Street - as it relates to the men hanging out and the proliferation of street vendors - then you MUST contact Councilmember Moya as follows:<br /><br />fmoya@council.nyc.gov&nbsp; <br />his staff person Phiviline Solano at psolano@council.nyc.gov<br /><br />His district office: Tel: 718-651-1917<br /><br />Please contact his office on a regular basis. As the old adage states: The squeaky wheel gets the grease!<br />That is not to say that expressing your concerns to Councilmember Dromm is not warranted, so do both!!

				&nbsp;The scene both in front of the Post Office and on 82nd street are real deterrents to both areas. Am now avoiding them and not shopping as much on 37th Ave anymore. If I do, it&#039;s a beeline to the exact store and then back off to 35th Ave. Actually use 35th a lot now because of the e-bike situation on 34th which is an issue as well. These problems are huge and pervasive but speaking only for myself, there are some days where it&#039;s daunting to think of the solution in our current state. I personally think putting the Open Streets on 37th would be a much better idea but have said that before...

				Something needs to be done about this, and I don&#039;t just mean the drunks at the post office or on 82nd Street. There is also a group of men who drink outside of the grocery on 86th and 37th who like to harass women as they walk by, not to mention the skinny, moron of a drug dealer operating openly across the street (he&#039;s brought some real stand up citizens to the area). Our current elected officials (Dromm and Moya) are useless. The candidates for District 25 seem to think that the only thing that matters is OpEn StReEEEEEETS and the choices for District 21 consist of Moya (useless), someone who appears to be functionally illiterate, a domestic abuser/felon, and a social worker who seems to only want to give people good vibes. I&#039;m not convinced that any of these candidates are going to do anything to combat these issues. The 115th clearly doesn&#039;t care, and hasn&#039;t for some time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been calling 311, as well as Dromm and Moya&#039;s offices, about these things regularly (several times a week) for the better part of the last nine months with no positive results. My 311 complaints are closed within 10 minutes of me calling. Moya&#039;s office simply doesn&#039;t respond. At least Dromm&#039;s office sends a stock email.<br /><br />The end result is that we have people changing their daily routines, avoiding certain stores, and feeling unnecessarily uncomfortable in their surroundings. This isn&#039;t right and it isn&#039;t good for our community.

				This situation is repeated all over NYC. From the UWS to Greenwich Village to Washington Heights. <br /><br />I guess the predicament has led to the toughest of the Mayoral candidates appearing to be the frontrunner. By a lot. <br />&nbsp;<br />New Yorkers seem to be demanding that these problems be dealt with. <br />

				The people discussed in this thread are human beings with substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Instead of calling for policing and punishment, how about some compassion? If one feels strongly about not wanting to see people passed out drunk on the sidewalks in the neighborhood, consider joining or starting a group to give them the help and support they need to get them off the streets and simultaneously improve their well-being and the health of the neighborhood.

The question is how to solve the problem. I do not have extra space, or the resources required, to house and rehabilitate 10 to 20 people who are alcoholic. Perhaps we can work together to propose possible solutions, not just vilify the downtrodden.

So yeah, I&#039;m worried and I don&#039;t know what the solution is. <br /><br />A few weeks ago someone clearly intoxicated pushed another one very violently in front of the subway stairs. The second person fell on the ground hard. He missed my 5 yo by 3 or 4 inches. This time. What about the next? This was at 5 pm. We were just trying to return home from afterschool.

				The hard truth about people who have alcohol and substance abuse problems is that they must make their own decisions to turn around their lives. The resources to do that are everywhere. AA and NA meetings are all over NYC.<br /><br />Usually the person must hit their lowest point before turning their lives around.<br /><br />It appears these folks have not reached their lowest point as yet.. <br /><br />I also have seen people try to help them.<br /><br />I shudder to imagine what their lowest point might be since this is not it. <br /><br />I can only guess the situation will lead to eventual mortalities.<br /><br /><br /><br />

They&#039;d rather focus on 34th Avenue, as if that&#039;s the ONLY block that matters in Jackson Heights.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The irony is that folks are paranoid about COVID but the public health consequences of excrement in the streets is Third World...and disease from that situation is possibly worse than COVID. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The public health implications are real.<br /><br />KGDHP, I&#039;m inclined to agree with you; we shouldn&#039;t need to put up with this. Our elected officials will likely continue to be useless until after the election since they don&#039;t want to risk losing votes. And let&#039;s face it, they weren&#039;t all that helpful to begin with. I guess the only thing we can do is continue to put pressure on the powers that be to do something. It&#039;s exhausting though...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Irony upon ironies. Elected officials are worried about losing votes by stopping Third World diseases from happening in their electorate? Consequences gone berserk&nbsp; due to &quot;Virtual Signaling&quot;.<br /><br />The tables will turn. Virtue Signaling will go out of fashion. Pro-active politicians will be elected. (eg Eric Adams)

I called them back in April (Still saved the VM), where they told me they&#039;re aware but there&#039;s &quot;nothing they can do.&quot; Um, YEAH RIGHT. How about at least a power wash?

				I also witnessed three Hispanic drunkards with rubicund cheeks lying flat in front of BK on Saturday afternoon. They were passed out and people could&#039;ve hurt them and they wouldn&#039;t even know it.&nbsp; Empty beer cans surrounded them. I&#039;m frustrated as I feel sorry for them (they could&#039;ve been illegal immigrants with nowhere to stay/go), but also mad why they allowed themselves to band with accomplices and got drunk like that.&nbsp; I mean, you can&#039;t even function properly at work in such condition.

				^^CB3 announced on social media that its site was going to be down for maintenance. Which holy cow, I hope they get can save it from the space/time anomaly that has kept it stuck in 1996. This is a pretty good time to do it since they are on a break for the summer.<br /><br />Sounds like you aren&#039;t aware of the different committee meetings you can attend (transportation, education, land use, economic development, immigrant affairs) in addition to the monthly meeting (which is where they deal with liquor licenses.) And BTW, for the businesses applying for a liquor license, getting one is a big deal and a delay with the community board is a problem.<br /><br />Maybe you should apply to CB3 and see about starting a committee specifically about homeless issues (if there isn&#039;t already one).

				There was a sleeping man in front of the old bank on 77th and 37th. on Monday He was on some kind of table with lots of trays of half eaten food next to him and on the ground . I think it might have been about 5pm when I passed him. When I made my return he was still there but on his feet and looking livelier. I don&#039;t know whether he was intoxicated but he was out of it when I first passed by.<br /><br />There is another continuing encampment and that is on the corner of 75th and Broadway right next to the subway entrance. Invariably there are two or three men there usually lying down on cardboard makeshift beds.<br /><br />The problem is that when there is more of a presence like this in our community the more it will attract other homeless men who will as in LA make these temporary arrangements into something more permanent.I have no solution to this but it is the responsibility of the politicians to at least admit that there is a problem and offer ideas to reclaim the quality of life that we wanted when we decided to live here.

				The encampment situation is mostly in front of empty stores. For instance, if HSBC were still on 37th Ave, there&#039;s no way the guy creating such a mess would be allowed to remain. Same with Burger King on 82nd.<br /><br />A law forcing landlords of stores to be responsible to some degree for the cleanliness of the area around their stores, would quickly put a stop to the problem.

This is a public health/safety issue. Please stop trying to pretend that it isn&#039;t. Also, these gentlemen have made a choice to adopt this as a lifestyle, something that I haven&#039;t seen the other unfortunate people in our neighborhood do. I&#039;ll gladly give the woman who comes by my building looking for bottles some cash a few times a week because I know that she has two children to take care for. <br /><br />These men have harassed women, and exposed themselves to everyone on the sidewalk, while making absolutely no effort to improve their situation. Do you also pity them for their lack of decency? Sorry, but these aren&#039;t people who are simply unfortunate.

				The city provides homeless shelters. AA meetings are everywhere. Mental health issues can be managed if a person continues their medication. Church (etc) outreach group are available. The solutions exist.<br /><br />Being an adult means taking responsibility for one&#039;s situation and actions.<br /><br />Sanctimonious attitudes don&#039;t help anyone. <br /><br />Except to make people who spout them believe they are superior. <br /><br />

				<br />I can&#039;t speak for others but whatever &quot;vituperative tone&quot; I can summon is for the political class in our community who have not addressed what is a growing threat to civil life in our community. There is a deafening silence when it comes to these quality of life concerns. <br />Yesterday I took a walk down 37th Ave and the man who on 77th St is still there(joined by another man who has taken up a spot&nbsp; slightly up 77th). Food cartons are all over, open and spilling its contents. Further down 37th the garbage can on 76th was overflowing with bags that were all over the street.&nbsp; This was replicated on other corners and on 74th St<br /><br />As I would not dehumanise the unfortunates who live on the street I would also hope that those of us who see this as a crisis in the maintenance of civil life for the majority of people who live here are not demonised as heartless or self-interested. If there is a way these men can be helped then they should be helped. What I despair of is our feckless politicians who do nothing to retain the character of the community and who turn the other way when parts of Jackson Heights are in the beginning stage of becoming skid row.

Rome is burning here and by Rome, I mean our commercial districts. So, so much attention to Open Streets when the vital business districts are in crisis. Diversity Plaza had/has so much potential and could still be turned around. We tell guests from out of town arriving by subway to take a different route away from that area which is unfortunate as some of the food is delicious and there are some good retail establishments too. But it&#039;s too dirty and chaotic and unwelcoming as a public space. Who&#039;s responsible for this area???

				Just an update.&nbsp; The picture is from yesterday (Saturday) morning.&nbsp; The FDNY and EMT were giving medical attention to some of the barrachos in front of Burger King on 82nd Street.&nbsp; One had bandages around his head.&nbsp; &nbsp;The remaining colony moved over to Rite Aide on 37th Avenue, and today there were more EMT and police dealing with the guys.&nbsp; &nbsp; I had seen the guys drinking this morning, and by the afternoon some of them were passed out.&nbsp; It looked like the EMT were taking some of the worst cases away.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just so sad that this has become such an all to frequent sight in Jackson Heights.

				I took Jhlifer&#039;s advice and wrote to most of the relevant people on the list. I have heard back from Clr. Dromm. His reply was that they are aware of the problem and an organization called Common Ground is trying to get these men into shelters although with little success. Many of the men prefer to live on the streets than go to a shelter it would seem. As the NYPD no longer deals with the issue of homeless men it seems that only persuasion is left. <br /><br />The final bit of advice I had from Clr. Dromm was that we should call 311 about any instance of homeless camps in Jackson heights as that will &quot; document the situation and it helps me to get more resources&quot; So to that end I will call 311 tomorrow and I hope anyone who cares about this issue will do the same.

				DSSH is right that the homeless man of 77th St. is or, was when I passed him today, sitting on a railing on 37th Ave. This is clearly not the hopeful conclusion to this saga&nbsp; that I had wanted.I think we must accept that helping someone who doesn&#039;t want help results in this kind of impasse. The message he needs to hear however is that of the many available options to him living in the midst of the community as he has is not an option that can continue. It poses a risk to him and to us and that message will be reiterated if he continues to live on the street. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the solution is to the issue of how to protect our public space while at the same time remaining mindful of the needs of these unfortunates. What I do know is that the period when we watched and remained inactive and despairing about these things helped no one.

				Ekbalam your comment is unhelpful and frivolous. The sarcasm leads no where . It offers no problem solving, it is not an attempt to develop pragmatic solutions or build some consensus about how to proceed. It is meant to ridicule those of us who worry about our public spaces being used as open air flop houses. Of course we are talking about two or three instances of homeless men living on the street but what if it grew to ten encampments which is perfectly possible(see the LA examples of how this happens) would you be still be using the same Olympian dismissal of concerns about these problems?

				Perhaps an idea is to ask the guy on the railing his story. He turned up out of the blue recently. But he must come from somewhere...maybe finding out where he was previously could help with his situation. If none of us here can talk with him due to his mental illness...(it&#039;s dealing with real life...not arguing on a forum theoretically)...a professional city social worker might.

				i&#039;ve had one very brief conversation with him, which he initiated. this was a couple of weeks ago. he was pleasant, asked me how my day was going, didn&#039;t ask for any money/food/anything. perfectly cogent (not that that has much to do with his mental state). i didn&#039;t think to ask him for his backstory, since i seldom do that with anyone the first time i speak with them.

				They should be called alcoholics. They suffer from a disease which is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Most do not recover. They will eventually die of alcohol related illness. Do you have a special jeering name for anyone who has lung cancer and ever smoked?&nbsp; I think a little pity and compassion is called for.

				We need police on the beat that have a relationship with the community.&nbsp; Maybe overnight in a drunk tank to sober them up and get them some social services would do the trick.&nbsp; Same with all the unwanted solicitation on Roosevelt avenue.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the 115 and 108 are aware of the situation as much as the residents of the neighborhood.&nbsp; Arresting or ticketing won&#039;t solve the problem you need to get to the root cause.
