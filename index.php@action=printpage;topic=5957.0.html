				I found this feisty little puppy on 89th Street between 34th and 35th Avenue.&nbsp; It has numerous tags one of which claims it has a microchip but when I entered the number on the tag, the database responded there was no such number.<br /><br />This puppy was loved and cared for.&nbsp; If you see a sign somewhere about a little lost puppy, please let me know and thank you for being helpful.&nbsp; I am determined to find its owner who must be very sad tonight.&nbsp; My puppy is good natured and sweet and we will try to make our little orphan as comfortable as we can until we find the owners of this delightful ball of fur.<br /><br />Thank you for your kind response.

				I called the vet on Northern Blvd between 89th and 90th Street.&nbsp; He did not return my call.&nbsp; I went all around the neighborhood this morning with my puppy and our foundling but there were no signs for a lost puppy and no one seemed to know this cute little guy.&nbsp; It&#039;s so odd.<br /><br />He cried the whole night.&nbsp; I fed him and walked him and played with him but he cried and wailed the whole night.&nbsp; He misses his family.&nbsp; My Ruffian tries to play with him and, of course gets ansy, when I pet and pay attention to the newcomer.&nbsp; But the two puppies are not aggressive toward each other except for an occasional &quot;me first&quot; for a treat or a neck rub.&nbsp; They are both sleeping comfortably at the moment and my apartment is quiet.<br /><br />Tomorrow I will try to contact the vet on 89th, International Veterinary, because one of the tags lists that name on a Rabies vaccine.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If this were my puppy, I&#039;d be putting up fliers and combing the street.&nbsp; The silence from the owners is deafening and very disturbing.&nbsp; I&#039;m going out again to see if there are any fliers anywhere and I will check with Noah&#039;s Ark.&nbsp; Working for an accounting firm during tax season (12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week the closer we get to April 15th) makes doing anything else almost impossible until after the deadline.&nbsp; Maybe the owners will come forward ... unless they just threw him away.&nbsp; &nbsp;People cannot be that heartless ... or could they!!!!????<br /><br />Thank you dearest bellabella and camh.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you posted.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				arlinda just saw a sign across from the library a small white dog is missing.&nbsp; I believe the sign said around 85 Street. Perhaps this it?&nbsp; The number is 347 396 5174 I am posting this and not PMing&nbsp; you because&nbsp; if it isn&#039;t the dog maybe&nbsp; someone else found it. Good luck!

				Bellabella<br /><br />The little grey puppy found his owner. &nbsp;I walked him about 2 hours ago and a woman came racing down the street screaming that&#039;s my puppy!!!<br /><br />She lives two doors down from my building. &nbsp;I asked her why there was no notice or fliers and how did her puppy get out. &nbsp;She said he slipped out of the house and she didn&#039;t notice him missing until after 11:00 pm last night. &nbsp;She didn&#039;t thank me or shake my hand but the puppy was happy to see her. &nbsp;In the process of combing the neighborhood for signs, I lost my very expensive glasses!!!! &nbsp;Oh well, who said no good deed goes unpunished.<br /><br />Bella if anything turned out right in all of this it was your kindness and the puppy&#039;s happiness. &nbsp;Thank you for your support and concern.

				Arlinda, that was very nice of you to take the dog home. I wonder why the owner is such a jerkface.

				I&#039;m really curious about the faux micro-chip. You should tell her it doesn&#039;t work or she got scammed or whatever.

				I&#039;m going to be very, very kind to the owner of the lost dog and say she was soooooo thrilled to see her dog, she FORGOT to be polite, gracious, appreciative, thankful and just generally nice when she found you with her dog.<br /><br />You, on the other hand, are probably all of the above.&nbsp; Good for you.
