				Many parts of NYC are experiencing tremendous development pressures.&nbsp; So far, Jackson Heights has only gotten a small taste of this, along 73rd Street, but there is surely much more to come.&nbsp; While the historic district will retain its character, there is little to protect the character of areas outside this district.&nbsp; This thread is dedicated to discussion of these issues.<br /><br />(One problem is that NYC&#039;s historic preservation laws are so strict that it is politically difficult to expand these protections to new areas.&nbsp; Perhaps a new, more flexible regulatory regime that allows for some additional development, and provides property owners a bit more leeway might enable the expansion of protections to a much larger area.&nbsp; But that would require a major change in the legislation and strategies underlying historic preservation in NYC.)<br /><br />For those interested in these issues, there is a new project getting started that will attempt to grapple with these issues.&nbsp; According to its website (http://www.minervapartners.org/vision_nyc/2007/12/home.html), &quot;<strong>Preservation Vision: Planning for the Future of Preservation in New York City</strong> is a year-long initiative to engage those interested in preservation in a conversation about their aspirations for preservation in New York City in the year 2030 and the actions needed to make those hopes a reality.&quot;&nbsp; This initiative is starting off with a web-based survey, and will hopefully provide opportunities for engaging in this discussion in person at a community level.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep you posted as I learn more.<br /><br /><br /><em>Update -- Here are some related threads:</em><br />The Polk Theater (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=357.0)<br />Possible New School (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=525.0)

				<strong>Preservation : Sustainability</strong> is a program of four all-day programs on the vital link between historic preservation and a sustainable future, to be held June 2-5, 2008 in New York City.<br /><br />These courses are intended for design professionals in private practice, government and non-profit agencies, and students in architecture, landscape architecture, planning and historic preservation. Each one-day course addresses a different aspect of sustainabilityâ€”green building, environment, equity and economicsâ€” through the strategies, tools and ethos of historic preservation. Classes are limited in size to facilitate site visits and interaction. Courses can be taken individually.<br /><br />The second course, which will be offered on June 3rd, is titled, &quot;Equity: Historic Districts and Fluid Communities: The Case of Jackson Heights&quot;<br /><br />For more information, see:<br />http://hdcvoice.blogspot.com/2008/04/preservationsustainability-4-part.html<br />http://www.preservation-shortcourse.org/<br />

				It really is a shame this is a paper game :o , if the Landmarks Commission really cared they should be more strict and or hands on with the aesthetics of the businesses and such . If it&#039;s not possible they should let the caring citizens to take charge or assist in some way ;) . BTW great work on the flower planting the JHBG has done the past weeks it&#039;s beautiful :smitten:&nbsp;

				It never ceases to amaze me&nbsp; the lack of real&nbsp; enforcement that the Landmarks Preservation has in the historic district of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; You would think that businesses which are new to the community would want to do the right thing.&nbsp; A new barber shop,&nbsp; Los Parceros at 35-64 84th Street, definitely did not seek approval from landmarks when putting up his awning. The signage put up is totally out of character with the architecture.&nbsp; It&#039;s such a great building and who ever has this storefront really could have done a great job and made a positive contribution.&nbsp; Now it ruins the whole ambiance of that block.&nbsp; It seems most unfair to the people who have moved here because Jackson Heights has an historic district.&nbsp; Several business and homeowner have gone to the trouble&nbsp; research, and expense&nbsp; to do alterations which are appropriate and architecturally fitting. It&#039;s frustrating to see such flagrant disregard.

				The difference is that Starbucks had permitts and approval from the&nbsp; Landmarks Preservation Commission.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the latter case of Los Parceros,&nbsp; they had neither. I also believe that Starbucks has&nbsp; no outside awning.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t cost to fill out an applications to landmarks,&nbsp; and if it does,&nbsp; it minimal. I live in the historic district and have had work done to my home.&nbsp; When I did I was sensitive to what was original.&nbsp; The point is why would&nbsp; you decide to do business in an historic distinct if your not interested in doing the right thing for preservation.....namely restoration?!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thanks, Francis. I was upset to think they hadn&#039;t gotten permission. The other businesses on the block should now apply.

				does anyone know if anything is being done to save the La Mesa Verde apartment complex on 90th and 91st streets between 35th and 34th avenues?&nbsp; There was a poignant article in the Jackson Heights Beautification Group&#039;s newsletter about this place.&nbsp; Surely we can apply some pressure somewhere to restore it.

Also is there something to get Los Parceros barber shop on 84th to get rid of the crap of a sign they put up :buck2:?

				Is it possible for a representative of the JH Beautification group to speak to the owner of the&nbsp; Los Parceros barber shop?&nbsp; I too was hoping for something a bit more fitting.&nbsp; The site and block were so quaint looking. The sign is hideous and gaudy. I agree that it ruins the block.&nbsp; The stores to either side of the barber shop are also out of&nbsp; compliance according to Landmark regulations.
