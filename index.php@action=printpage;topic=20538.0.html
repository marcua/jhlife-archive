				Great if you have a car I suppose. At present it seems Rego Park still wins with a quick hop on the Q53. <br />Wish they&#039;d moved into the old Northern Blvd Walgreens when they had the chance.

From JH it can&#039;t get much easier, since it&#039;s convenient for those who live near the 7 and also those who live near the E/M/7. It probably doesn&#039;t make much sense to drive to the new one in LIC because there&#039;s no parking lot, and no guarantee you&#039;d get a street spot.<br />(https://i.imgur.com/rHCsTJ7.png)

				I went there yesterday. Very spacious and lovely daylight windows at the checkout. Would have been perfect if the elevator to the 7 train had been working - thanks to the kind young man who schlepped my bag up.the stairs. I&#039;ll try to familiarize myself with any alternative entrances next time. Very glad they opened!

Wished they would create shelf specifically for new items like at other TJs. Could you use the Queens Plaza station for the E/R/M trains?

				Thanks, yes, I&#039;ll be exploring the area, including access to Gantry park when it&#039;s cooler. I&#039;ve been accustomed to going via Vernon-Jackson.

				This Trader Joe&#039;s in Court Sq is great.<br /><br />No lines when I went. And that&#039;s a miracle when it comes to any other Trader Joe&#039;s I have ever been to.<br /><br />Definitely handy for stopping there on the way back from Manhattan . (E, M or 7 trains.) <br /><br />Their prices etc make it worth the stop. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
