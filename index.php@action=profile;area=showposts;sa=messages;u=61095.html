					Hi Shelby - I hadn&#039;t looked at (or known about) the MPC site - thanks for the direct! I&#039;m curious about the $1.1M apt - says call broker/owner, I&#039;m taking that to mean its his own apt. In any event, I&#039;ve been in both 3-beds and 2-beds apts in the Hawthorne as a guest -admittedly none of these- and my understanding is that every other bldg on both 77th and 76th streets alternate between 2-beds and 3-beds. I also recall being told that the apts originally were designed as 1-bed and 2-beds with a sunroom (the 2nd or 3rd bed as currently marketed). That makes sense to me, as this room is right off the dining room, accessed via French doors and have two walls of windows. In the 2-bed I was a guest in, the bedroom was given to the kids when they came along and the parents used what was the TV room (sunroom) as their bedroom. The 3-bed I was in had the sunroom as a kind of den/tv room as well. The ensuite in this room was also fairly small, bordering on tiny. I see what you say about the layout on the 2-bed in NYT -- looks like to me at some point the doorway to the sunroom was expanded and the French doors removed, so one would need to put that all back in order to make it a proper bedroom. The 2-bed as I remember my friends - that closet in the dining room, the entrance door was actually in sunroom. I agree with you, as it is now, the layout is pretty odd and would require some reno to bring it back to how it was to utilize as a proper 2-bed. But as you say, all depends on whether the board would allow it. <br /><br />As far as the maintenance, I suppose that&#039;s what happens when each building is individually managed - you get the same apts with different monthlies based on the bldg you&#039;re in as there don&#039;t seem to be any additional amenities one bldg offers over another. <br /><br />Thanks again -- I continue to look...

					Lilybell - Thanks for your reply! I am familiar with WP as I&#039;ve friends who have lived in the buildings. One couple moved out about six years ago to buy a house up in the 80&#039;s. They loved it and speak highly of WP still. Another was a single gent, he just moved out I want to say in May - another who loved WP, but did not love the conversion process or pricing. There&#039;s still a couple I know there and they are buying their apt, but I&#039;ve gotten one read from one of them, and a different one from the other! I have to say the rooms in WP are huge! The buildings themselves are well cared for - I would have thought they were co-ops already to be honest. I have looked at their site and seen ads in NYT for them but I&#039;m leery about the pricing and the conversion. A sponsor holding the majority on the board can be nightmarish. Also, I can&#039;t get past 73rd street -- it just always looks so dirty and seems kind of chancy at night. For the prices WP is asking, I&#039;d be as happy spending it in one of the other buildings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cyril - thanks for your response and input! I&#039;m long enough in the tooth to not have this impossible wish list of &quot;must haves&quot; - trust me! ;-) Ideally, a 2 or 3 bed with 2 baths would suit me just fine. Renovations wouldn&#039;t scare me away either - though one hopes the board requirements for renos aren&#039;t overly onerous either. As was touched on earlier in this thread, renovating back to and/or keeping the original features would be right up my alley vs &quot;modernizing&quot; an apt and losing all that charm. <br /><br />W/R/T the disparity in pricing, the pics on NYT site show two well kept even updated apts - if you search &quot;11372&quot; and 2 beds on NYT site, you&#039;ll see the two Hawthorne Court apts - one on 77th and one on 76th. Even with one needing a reno (which it doesn&#039;t appear to) and one with an extra bed, $250K difference in price still seems like A LOT to me. <br /><br />I agree with you - the smaller co-ops would view travel/absence as a negative as they need &quot;all hands on deck&quot; so to speak to run the co-op. Honestly, that wouldn&#039;t be for me. Providing the building is run well, finances managed, etc. I&#039;m happy enough to be a regular shareholder. I suppose I should narrow my search on this criteria now and reach out to some local brokers in JH hoping they have some listings not on NYT (I&#039;ve seen the one in the Towers for sale and not for me). <br /><br />I only asked about 1 person buying a large apt as one of my good friends in the Chateau warned that some boards &quot;don&#039;t like that&quot; -- something about being afraid who could be moving in with me or such. Silly I thought.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again for your replies!!

					Hi everyone - <br /><br />New here and as my name indicates, I&#039;m looking in JH so this topic is of particular interest to me. As an anonymous board, I&#039;m hoping to get some information to help in my search and weigh against what I&#039;m getting from realtors and my friends who own in some of these buildings. I love the apartments in JH! What you can get for your money in terms of space, charm, history makes it pretty ideal to me. <br /><br />My favorite buildings would be: The Towers, Hawthorne, Chateau, Elm, Fillmore, The Colonials, The Delano. <br /><br />With regard to the Hawthorne - I see 2 are for sale right now: a 2 bed on 77th and a 3 bed (3rd is sunroom) on 76th. I understand the 3 bed would of course be more, but what I cannot understand is it being $250K more than the 2 bed. If I&#039;ve been told correct, all the Hawthorne&#039;s are individually managed by building - surely this can&#039;t be a reason for such a huge variance in pricing? The maintenance fees are comparable enough and all things being equal, I can&#039;t fathom an extra $250K for the extra room. Am I missing something? <br /><br />Itsit mentioned the board at the Towers - as this is my preferred/favourite building in JH, any chance you could expand? My understanding is unlike the Chateau, Hawthorne, Elm, and Greystones that the Towers is managed as a single unit with a single board vs separate management and boards for each building. <br /><br />As I travel a few months a year on business, I&#039;ve been advised not to disclose this unless asked as boards don&#039;t like it. Based on experiences, can any of you offer whether this may be true?&nbsp; Its not like I&#039;d be renting it out or anything. Another potential &quot;stumbling block&quot; as one realtor put it, is that I&#039;m one person looking for a 2 or 3 bedroom (1 bed for me, 1 for guests/home office or 1 guest and 1 office). Again, I wouldn&#039;t be sharing, so at a loss why that&#039;s an issue. <br /><br />Finally - as you all live here, what is your opinion -- local JH realtor or no? I&#039;ve seen units with realtors from larger Manhattan based firms, but even tho friends in neighborhood advise against, I&#039;m thinking local guys may have more influence with boards and/or hold pocket listings? Thoughts?
