				Title: <strong>A Question about Open Table</strong><br />

				I have to decide whether Swim Two Birds should use Open Table to book reservations.<br /><br />As you may know, Open Table charges a monthly fee plus $1 per guest booked through its site and 25 cents booked through our restaurant&#039;s site.<br /><br />This adds up to a great deal of money over a year and the cost is passed on to guests. It also results in restaurants showing, on Open Table, that their restaurant is fully booked, when it isn&#039;t, to avoid paying Open Table&#039;s $1 per person fee. <br /><br />So a couple of questions...<br /><br />What would be your reaction if we used reservation software that didn&#039;t involve a per diner fee?<br /><br />What is your view of Yelp generally and in particular of its reservation software SeatMe?<br /><br />For background, Open Table has about 1740 restaurants in Manhattan, 178 in Brooklyn, 90 in Queens and five in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Stew<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Stew, <br /><br />I use open table when it is linked through the restaurant&#039;s website, but I have no particular loyalty to open table as a platform/service. Online reservations are convenient, but I think as long as you make it clear and easy to access from your restaurant&#039;s website, any service will do (I don&#039;t use opentable to browse restaurants; I don&#039;t find their restaurant selection to be *that* great. I&#039;d rather choose where I want to eat and go from there). <br /><br />I&#039;ve never used yelp&#039;s seatme app. As far as reviews, I absolutely take them with a grain of salt, but checking yelp is a useful way to quickly get a read on a restaurant, and if I see a whole slew of negative reviews, it does give me pause before deciding to dine somewhere. <br /><br />Very excited for your restaurant to open!<br />Paula&nbsp;

I don&#039;t know how many reservations are driven FROM opentable as opposed to TO opentable from other links like yelp, or websites or google searches.<br /><br />While we&#039;re talking about technology<br /><br />Lots of restaurants mess up their websites.&nbsp; The website&#039;s front page should work on mobiles as well as laptop/pc browsers, and on this front page it should have<br />**in searchable text**, (not as a graphic)<br /><br />i) opening hours, <br />ii) reservation link - clickable to whichever service works for you AND works on mobile platforms well<br />iii) address - which is a clickable link to google maps<br />iv) phone - clickable link to make the phonecall from a cellphone<br />v) A link to a menu in TEXT that is readable on a cellphone and pc.<br /><br />Also, please resist the idea of making a super high end front page website that crashes on older systems or phones; I and others have aborted attempts to go to restaurants at last minute because their website simply doesn&#039;t work and I can&#039;t find info (badly formatted pdfs that cant be read on phones, menus in flash, stupid scrolling effects etc etc etc)!&nbsp; <br /><br />Clean, simple, quick loading FUNCTIONAL on as many platforms as possible. (bury the beautifully designed/resource intensive animations/pictures/social stuff behind the front page if you must). <br />

				I second both the previous posters.<br /><br />I do make reservations online when some system is available - I love the convenience. I don&#039;t care if it&#039;s Open Table or another. (I did not know how the charges to restaurants work. Interesting. Thank you for the insight.)<br /><br />Whole heartedly agree about the digital requirements. A beautiful flash-driven front page that crashes on some browsers or doesn&#039;t render on mobile is a waste of money these days. When checking a restaurant&#039;s site I&#039;m most interested in looking at the menu, making reservations, reading reviews or press clippings if there are any, seeing photos of the dining room. I&#039;m usually doing this on my phone.<br /><br />Good luck with the opening!

				Thanks wallaby, lalochezia and Minimal4Me.<br /><br />I had a demo today of an on-line reservation system that is proven, robust and stable, and that has none of the issues associated with Open Table and Seat Me. We&#039;re likely to go with it.<br /><br />I agree with <em>every single word</em> of your comments on restaurant web sites.<br /><br />Stew<br /><br />Swim Two Birds on Facebook (https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Instagram (https://instagram.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Twitter (https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />My Personal Tweets (https://twitter.com/stewartwadden)<br /><br /><br />

So why does a restaurant sign up? Open Table is essentially a marketing platform, and an expensive one, and in Manhattan it isn&#039;t really optional if one accepts Open Table&#039;s argument that people search for, and select, restaurants via Open Table searches. Outside Manhattan, its footprint, and therefore power, is much less.
