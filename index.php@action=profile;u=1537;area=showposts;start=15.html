					I&#039;ve never noticed people at the Met, specifically, acting that way, but it&#039;s rare to find a happy grocery worker. Also, it&#039;s been my experience that when employees of a certain establishment (regardless of what it is) are systemically unpleasant or rude, it&#039;s usually because they are not being treated well at their jobs or are otherwise unhappy with some part of their lives. Your experiences there don&#039;t sound fun, but it also sounds as though these folks are in a bad way. I would feel sorry for them.&nbsp; On top of that, if you know that this is the kind of treatment you will get when you go there, having gone there for 10 years, then (not trying to sound harsh or mean) you should know what to expect by now, right? Maybe try to keep it in perspective, so that when you don&#039;t get the good deal on the muffins or when people there are belligerent to you, you can remember that you&#039;re dealing with sad and unhappy people, and maybe cut them some slack. And, if you don&#039;t like the way the business is run overall, there are plenty of other grocery stores!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />

					I grew up in the forest and am pretty familiar with raccoons. Raccoons are nocturnal, and are generally afraid of people. All they want is food; they&#039;re scavengers. They&#039;re probably going through garbage cans or other trash, looking for tasty bits and scraps. For the most part, if you leave them alone, they will leave you alone. <br /><br />This being said, if you see a raccoon during the day, something is very wrong, and usually those guys turn out to be rabid. I would call animal control right away if I saw a raccoon running around in the daytime. They can also be very vicious when they have to be, so I would recommend people not letting their dogs approach them or run around outside, unsupervised (probably goes without saying, anyway). In a dog vs. raccoon fight, it&#039;d be a toss-up, even for a very fierce dog.<br /><br />It is very strange that they are here. I wonder where they may have come from. This is a very inhospitable place for them, for the most part, even though there&#039;s ample food for them here.

I couldn&#039;t believe that you were actually saying what I thought you had said. But yeah, you are saying just that. <br /><br />I learn the lesson over and over again that there some people out there who are cold and uncaring, completely devoid of empathy or respect for their fellow humans. I see evidence of this every day, to a varying extent, in this city. I struggle to believe that we, as a species, are collectively working toward and moving toward a better way of Being, that we are slowly evolving to be more considerate and more understanding of one another, that we will ultimately reach some kind of as-yet-undetermined enlightenment which will enable us to coexist and to help one another. Perhaps this is naive, but it is my secret and necessary hope. This being said, I confess: it only takes something like this, some utterly ignorant and hateful comment (anonymously made on an internet forum, no less) to make me doubt that fragile belief. As long as there are people out there with a dark and vast abyss within them, people who are intrinsically selfish and full of hate and fear, people who keep themselves closed off from the world, clinging desperately to their failed and feeble ideologies, we will be stuck exactly where we are, only slightly better off than our monkey counterparts, flinging feces at each other and killing one another with little or no provocation. I&#039;ll chalk you up to a failed attempt at humanity. You&#039;re holding us back, dude.

					Yuck. <br /><br />I had a friend who worked at a Taco Bell inside of a Target. She said that they used to get the meat shipped to them in giant plastic bags, and that it was a dull grey color. They had to add red dye to it to make it look more like &quot;meat.&quot; She also said that, interspersed throughout the meat were these large flaps of skin or tendon that looked very gross; some had what looked to be fur attached to them. She said that when a customer was particularly rude to her or her staff, they would make sure that that customer got a flap in their taco. I never ate meat at Taco Bell again.<br /><br />Before I had a sort of personal diet and lifestyle revolution, I used to have a weakness for the BK Whopper. I&#039;d eat one once a month or so. Now, though, I walk past it on 82nd Street and I smell that gross smoke smell they pump out of there and it makes me feel a little nauseous. I never eat fast food. I haven&#039;t for a couple of years. I see people on the train eating it pretty much every day (especially Chinese folks in Flushing eating McDonald&#039;s), and I wonder how their insides must be faring.<br /><br />Whenever I think about eating sketchy meat, I think about all of the horribleness associated with that choice. It&#039;s not only that you&#039;re ingesting who knows what chemicals and hormones and additives either given to the cow(s) or added to the meat in processing; you&#039;re also contributing to the suffering of a living creature raised and slaughtered in terrible conditions, perpetuating an unsustainable system that exploits animals and humans alike. Why would you want to make all of that awfulness part of your body? Why would you choose to contribute to the continuation of a fundamentally destructive way of living?<br /><br />Sorry for the preaching.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" />

					We had a great meal, last night. It was very affordable, and they had a lot of very tasty veggie options. The saag paneer was very good- it was more subtly spiced than what I&#039;m used to, but it was very rich and flavorful, nonetheless. I also really recommend the garlic naan. It was stuffed with garlic and piping hot. Really tasty. We ordered a couple of Bengali and Nepali appetizers that I can&#039;t remember the name of, unfortunately, but I feel comfortable saying that overall, the food is great. You can&#039;t really go wrong.<br /><br />One caveat: My mango lassi was a bit off... I&#039;m not sure whether this was because of the yogurt used or whether the mango wasn&#039;t fresh fruit. It&#039;s hard to say. I&#039;d steer clear of it, either way. They always taste better made at home, anyway.<br /><br />Other than that, our food was delicious. We will definitely be going back.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					I love the Jewish Community Center thrift store!&nbsp; It&#039;s small, but it&#039;s a real thrift store- not a store calling itself as such and selling used stuff for a ridiculous amount of money, nor is it a thrift &quot;boutique&quot; for hipsters. It&#039;s staffed mainly by elderly folks, and there can be some real treasures, there (depending on your definition of that word - we got a vintage McCoy figure from the old Star Trek series and some great records). They are also the area&#039;s #1 headquarters for crazy 80&#039;s clothes.

					Wow, that would be super awesome, if it had a wide selection of organic and local foods, sustainably and fairly sourced. Is Queensborough Plaza really the chosen site for it, though? It&#039;s such a noisy and dirty area, and it also seems as though opening a co-op right across the river from Manhattan doesn&#039;t really go a long way to bringing these food choices &quot;to Queens.&quot; I suppose they&#039;re thinking it would be somewhat centrally located in terms of public transport options, and that the hipster Astoria market would be close by? I vote Jackson Heights!&nbsp;
