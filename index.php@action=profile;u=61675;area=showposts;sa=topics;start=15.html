					A new report from localize.city analyzed NYPD collision data to find the intersections where the number of crashes involving pedestrians or cyclists were above the 99.5 percentile (for the type of intersection-- one, two, or three lane). Jackson Heights was identified as one of the 12 most dangerous areas in the city; the numbers for 2013 to Jan 2018 are:<br />Cyclists injured: 240<br />Pedestrians injured: 499<br />Killed: 9<br /><br />Full report:<br /><a href="http://labs.localize.city/here-are-nycs-12-most-dangerous-areas-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://labs.localize.city/here-are-nycs-12-most-dangerous-areas-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists/</a><br /><br />I think this report could be good for identifying areas in need of more infrastructure/safety measures for pedestrians and cyclists, but some of the methodology seems bizarre to me. It seems it might, for example, over-identify areas with the most cyclists (which are not the most dangerous, necessarily, but more cyclists = more opportunities for crashes with cyclists). That might explain why Williamsburg (generally considered a great place to bike) is listed as most dangerous. I do think good chunks of JH are legitimately dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians though.<br /><br />Second, the boundaries for &quot;Jackson Heights&quot; that they&#039;re using are totally off; no idea what it&#039;s based on, but it excludes lots of Jackson Heights and includes a good chunk of Elmhurst. &quot;Jackson Heights: general boundaries between 37th Avenue and Broadway, from 76th Street to 84th Street/Whitney Avenue&quot;

					This Buzzfeed story looked into how gentrification tends to come with a rise in official complaints made to 311/the police, sometimes setting up long-term residents for harassment:<br /><br /><em>Tracts that gentrified have received more complaints per capita than those that didn’t, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis of Census and 311 data. <br /><br />We looked at noise complaints about loud music, television sounds, or talking; complaints about blocked driveways; and complaints about illegal conversions of apartments.<br /><br />The chart below shows the results: the median number of complaints per 1,000 people, and the changes in racial composition, for gentrifying and nongentrifying tracts.<br /><br />Long-term residents said they rarely, if ever, called to complain — if they had a problem, they’d walk outside and say so.<br /><br />But one newcomer to the Harlem block said he’d rather call authorities than talk it out with his neighbors.</em><br /><br />Just curious: Do people tend to call 311 for things like this in Jackson Heights? Are you more likely to talk to your neighbor? (In the story, all the census tracts in Jackson Heights seem to show fewer white residents in 2016 than in 2000; I couldn&#039;t really read the graphic that showed which tracts were &quot;gentrifying&quot; by the reporter&#039;s official definition—not sure if JH qualifies.)<br /><br />There also was an interesting bit of JH trivia in this story:<br /><em>311 hotlines were first introduced in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1996, and have spread throughout the country. The service arrived in New York City in March of 2003 with the first caller filing a complaint about their neighbor having a noisy party in Jackson Heights at 12:01 a.m.<br /></em>

					On Friday, June 22, at about 8:40 p.m., the suspects approached a 30-year-old man on the staircase at the Broadway ‘7’ subway station in Jackson Heights, police said. They then blocked him from leaving and displayed a knife.<br /><br />The pair took his wallet containing $2, credit cards and ID cards, police said.<br /><br /><a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/police-looking-for-suspects-wanted-for-knife-point-robberies-at-queens-subway-stations" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/police-looking-for-suspects-wanted-for-knife-point-robberies-at-queens-subway-stations</a><br /><br />Hard to imagine that there weren&#039;t tons of people around in that station at that hour. Very unexpected (and unsettling) that someone could pull off a crime like that in the middle of a crowd.

Hard to imagine how the subway lines will accommodate all these additional commuters. I know the 7 line&#039;s signal upgrades will presumably mean more trains on that line, but how many more (and when those upgrades will actually be done), I have no idea. And the E train, for example, already seems to be at absolute max capacity at rush hour.

					Nine alleged members of the 97th Street Trinitarios and #Hot97Boyz gangs wound up in handcuffs on May 23 following police raids resulting from a long-term joint investigation by the NYPD Queens Gang Unit and the Queens District Attorney’s Narcotics Investigations Bureau. Another nine individuals connected to the drug sales also wound up behind bars.<br /><br />“A morning wake-up call by the police armed with court-authorized search warrants early yesterday morning resulted in the arrest of 18 individuals and the seizure of narcotics and drug paraphernalia, including marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, scales, packaging and over $80,000 in cash,” Queens District Attorney Richard A.

They knew they had made the right choice when they went to their first shareholder meeting.<br /><br />“Everyone was sweet, mostly our age, mostly first-time homeowners,” said Ms. Dercher, who is now the vice president of the board. “There was a sense of community that people often say they’re moving to the suburbs to find. I love this building.”</em><br /><br />I don&#039;t know that I&#039;ve ever walked by this building (at 42-22 Ketchum, right near Elmhurst Hospital). I think I would have noticed it if it looks like it does in these renderings... is this a new development?<br /><a href="http://www.berkshiregreennyc.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.berkshiregreennyc.com/</a><br />

					Has anyone tried Lamoon, a Northern Thai restaurant that seems to have opened recently in Elmhurst?<br />8140 Broadway<br /><br />I haven&#039;t checked it out yet; just stumbled across it on Yelp. Based on the photos, it looks like a pretty nice place to sit down and eat, though of course there&#039;s plenty of competition for Thai food in Elmhurst. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lamoon-queens" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.yelp.com/biz/lamoon-queens</a>

					Real estate listings in New York may do a great job of showing off a piece of property and highlighting some of its neighborhood’s best assets, but those cherrypicked details don’t portray the actual experience of living in a place. A new mobile-first website, called Localize.city, looks to inform renters and buyers about the areas they’re looking to move into by harnessing, and simplifying, droves of data about everything from shadow cover to current and future construction nearby.<br /><a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/11/17226450/localize-website-new-york-public-data" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/11/17226450/localize-website-new-york-public-data</a><br /><br />This story has more info on the site: <br /><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-going-on-at-your-new-york-apartment-building-a-new-website-aims-to-tell-you-1523457120" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-going-on-at-your-new-york-apartment-building-a-new-website-aims-to-tell-you-1523457120</a><br /><br />I was pretty impressed with what it pulled together for my address—much more thorough info than you&#039;d usually be able to find (easily) about an address you&#039;re considering living at: <br /><a href="https://www.localize.city" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.localize.city</a>

					<em>Three Queens neighborhoods are being called “food swamps” because they’re rife with places selling unhealthy food sources, according to a report released on Wednesday.<br /><br />Public Health Solutions, the largest public health nonprofit serving New York City, found that the large volume of food swamps in the borough resulted from the number of unhealthy food outlets outnumbering healthy alternatives. This means certain communities have limited access to healthy food choices, particularly in Jackson Heights, Corona and Jamaica.</em><br /><br />From: <a href="http://qns.com/story/2018/04/11/report-points-certain-queens-neighborhoods-food-swamps-cheap-unhealthy-meal-options/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://qns.com/story/2018/04/11/report-points-certain-queens-neighborhoods-food-swamps-cheap-unhealthy-meal-options/</a><br /><br />This seems so bizarre to me. I think of JH as a neighborhood with a plethora of wonderful food options—healthy, unhealthy, etc. We have multiple stores selling nothing but fresh produce, multiple supermarkets (of varying quality), a weekly farmer&#039;s market, an organic market, and many restaurants serving cuisines (Indian, Tibetan, Japanese) that are often quite healthy (depending on what you order).<br /><br />There&#039;s a link to the full report here:<br /><a href="https://www.healthsolutions.org/blog/queens-neighborhoods-street-mapping-project/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.healthsolutions.org/blog/queens-neighborhoods-street-mapping-project/</a><br />
