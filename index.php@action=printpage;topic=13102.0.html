				Maybe they were just cleaning or restocking or something, but when I passed by around 9:30 AM this morning, it was not open. Does anyone know?

				My sentiments exactly. I was excited to think it might be closed. We stopped shopping there when they had the dispute with their workers, and since then I&#039;ve wondered how they stay in business since they never appear to be busy. I pass by on my way to work and back, and I usually see a couple of customers at the registers and a couple more in the aisles. But I think I&#039;ve seen it closed before, and it didn&#039;t mean anything. Sigh.

				They are open. I took a look inside this afternoon. Not many customers. Those not avoiding the place because of the union issue might well be put off by the impression of stale meat that wafts around.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				when i passed by around 8:40 or so, the entire block of stores was shut. might&#039;ve been gas line inspection. i work in tribeca, and there have been a LOT of restaurants closed or partly closed for hours to a day since the explosion in the east village.
