					Hello JH,<br /><br />It&#039;s been a while and I have been out of the loop. Including my yoga practice, I&#039;ve been traveling for business and find myself a bit out of sorts. Cannot wait to get back into the studio. The weather here is taking a turn for the better and maybe it&#039;s time I consider my beach body as well. I will be taking a pilates class in addition to yoga. Looking forward to it.<br /><br />Looking at the posts I see a mention of the previous dance studio name. That is the same address but the former dance studio. Mimi is having dance events on saturday&#039;s and it started with Tango if I recall. I understand there will be a new dance every month. Worth looking into.

					OK so for the Tango Dance Series. There will be a class given every Saturday at 5pm for a series of 4 classes. After the 4 classes there will be a series on another type of class. Although their dance classes are fitness related I believe this Tango Series is more instructional and will give you taste of the alluring and sexy dance. I have always been curious about the Tango and plan to attend. Hope to see you there. The telephone number to the Mimi for Me Yoga studio is 718-505-YOGA (9642)

					Hello, I just saw this post and wanted to tell you about Mimi for Me Yoga. They offer yoga of course, Pilate&#039;s, and different dance type fitmess classes. I have been attending since they opened and it has been quite an experience. I haven&#039;t done the Pilate&#039;s but I hear it&#039;s a really nice workout. i have done the yoga and being new to yoga has been an eye opener, not at all what I expected. It was a workout, it was relaxing and it was insightful all in one package. Take a look at their webpage for a schedule.&nbsp; The studio itself is newly renovated, comfortable, clean and inviting. The staff is friendly, helpful, and also inviting. It is at the least a must try out place. Hope this was helpful.

					Hello JH,<br /><br />I know I haven&#039;t been here in a bit. Work and everyday life has been pretty hectic. Looking forward to a relaxing and energizing day at the Mimi for Me Yoga studio. I heard there is a Tango Dance Series starting soon, sounds like a lot of fun. Will get more details when I attend this weekends yoga. Hope to see you there. Have a great weekend. Best way to start it off is getting into yoga.

					Hi, I just saw your post about yoga classes. I can tell you about the new place in the neighborhood I have been attending. I am new to yoga and had a predisposed notion of what yoga was about. But when I took Mimi&#039;s class it was a total eye opener. It was relaxing, invigorating, inspiring, overall a great experience. That was about a month ago, since then I have taken a couple of classes by the other instructors and it was just as satisfying. The guided meditation class by Jared was again an eye opener in that you&#039;re not just sitting cross legged chanting ohm! There is movement and thought and insight. A recommended class.<br /><br />Just want to say welcome to the yoga community and I hope you give Mimi for Me Yoga a try. It is located at 79-05 Roosevelt Avenue on the 2nd floor and their number is 718-505-YOGA (9642). The studio is newly renovated and extremely comfortable.<br /><br />PS They also offer a variety of dance fitness classes, as a matter of fact there is a Tango series starting soon, sounds like alot of fun. Check out their website <a href="http://www.mimiformeyoga.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.mimiformeyoga.com</a> for schedules

					So what does everybody think of the new yoga studio on Roosevelt and 79th Street?<br /><br />I have been attending the Vinyasa Yoga classes and it has been a great experience. i feel more flexible and have learned a few things on clearing the mind. believe it or not I also feel like I walk taller.<br /><br />There are other types of yoga as well. Like power yoga and gentle yoga. They also offer guided meditation and body works which is a more personal yoga with a smaller class. <br /><br />Also being offered at the studio are different types of dance classes with an emphasis on fitness. They have salsa-licious, latin-licious and belly dance. I have seen the practitioners leaving after class and they are always laughing or have huge smiles on.<br /><br />Let&#039;s not forget the kids classes. My niece and daughter are hooked. They really enjoy the whole experience, from the kids karma, to the creative acting, to the dance class. The kids are having nonstop fun.<br /><br />So come on Jackson Heights join the fun. It has been great. The address is 79-05 Roosevelt Avenue on the 2nd floor.

					My daughter and my niece took the kids class yesterday. They loved it. They first started with kids yoga where they stretched and got ready for the other activities.&nbsp; The other activities turned out to be some interactive acting classes in which they acted out and made believe they were different animals. Laughing and smiling was at an all time high. Then it was all followed by some Hip-Hop dancing that really got them moving. Overall the kids loved it, and want to continue to take those classes.<br /><br />Hope to see more of the neighborhood there, have a great weekend everyone.

					Kids classes sounds like fun. I will make sure to bring my daughter. I will be in the studio taking one of the classes being offered so might as well let the little one enjoy herself as well.<br /><br />I do have to add that the instruction in the studio has been top notch. I don&#039;t feel any pressure to get the poses perfect and the flow of movement as well as the stretching has definately improved how I carry myself, or should I say my posture. I do Vinyasa Yoga but there are other types being offered and there are other types of classes as well. Well like they say seeing is believing, I recommend taking a class and judging for yourself.

					I have seen posters for the grand opening of the new yoga studio on Roosevelt Ave. The posters say there will be 2 sessions of samplers, one in the morning and one in the afternoon for just 5 dollars a session. I can say that the Vinyasa with Mimi is great, so I&#039;m going to give the others a try and see how it feels. They have pilates and dance samplers as well. <br /><br />The place is called Mi-Mi-for-Me-Yoga and it is located at 79-05 Roosevelt Ave on the 2nd floor. Sounds like fun.

					Good morning all, I just wanted to remind you all of the new yoga class in the neighborhood. I attended last week and I really did enjoy it, not only during the class but after the class as well. I felt relaxed not only in body but in mind as well. It was a great start to my Sunday. <br /><br />Tomorrow&#039;s class is at 11 am and the studio is located at 79-05 Roosevelt Ave, 2nd floor. You may want to call ahead and reserve a spot, call 718-505-YOGA or 917-561-5501, you can also e-mail <a href="mailto:mimiforme@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">mimiforme@gmail.com</a>. I was told that walk-ins are welcome but it is best to save a spot for yourself.<br /><br />Hope to see you there.

					I attended the new yoga place on Roosevelt Ave and 79 Street. It was a pre-opening class and the opening will be the weekend of the 13th. The class was of Vinyasa Yoga and was given by Mimi. The class was great, I am new to Yoga so the poses were new to me but not difficult and Mimi was very good at explaining the proper posture and feeling or insight for the pose. Her instruction was helpful, fun and towards the end of the class soothing. I will be back.<br /><br />Anyone interested I copied the following info from the flyer on the door: Yoga-Friendly, Mat Pilates, Yoga Dance, Meditation, Dance-a-licious, Belly dance, Massage Therapy.&nbsp; 79-05 Roosevelt Ave, Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br />call 917-561-5501 or e-mail <a href="mailto:mimiforme@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">mimiforme@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Again I really enjoyed the class and am looking forward to the next one.

					I have recently started doing Yoga which works both the mind and body. For me it has been invigorating. A workout, a stress reliever, and relaxing. I just saw there is a new spot opening on Roosevelt Avenue off of 79th Street. Anybody have any info on it?
