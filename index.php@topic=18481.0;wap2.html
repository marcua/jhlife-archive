			I plan on getting an emotional support animal (a small dog) but I live in a co-op with a no dog rule. Cats are allowed as far as I know. Has anyone ever dealt with this issue? What steps did you take to get approved besides getting a note from a medical professional?

			If you haven&#039;t already you should call the building&#039;s management and contact the board and ask what the requirements are, if any. I suggest you contact them first so that you get their buy in on this and you bring them in early on in the process. They may not have developed any protocol on this and your heads up may get them started on doing so.

			The person seeking the emotional support animal must have a verifiable disability (i.e., a doctor&#039;s note stating the need for an emotional support animal; the reason cannot just be a need for companionship). The animal is viewed as a &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHA or FHAct) to those housing communities that have a &quot;no pets&quot; rule.
