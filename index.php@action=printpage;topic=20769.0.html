				<em>That should read &quot;gone&quot;, not &quot;goan&quot; which would be delicious if JHlife was turned into a coconut curry. Alas....</em><br /><br />I loathe facebook. Nextdoor seems scummy. <br /><br />I recommend the somewhat moribund - for NOW - r/jacksonheights on reddit. <br /><br />https://old.reddit.com/r/jacksonheights/

				funny, i loathe reddit for its complicity in so much political mishegas. and i like FB because of the transparency. i&#039;d like to see a new message board, but that is such a 20th century format.....

				Facebook transparency? HAHAHAHA!!! I just spit out my egg nog. I don&#039;t seem to find reddit being talked about much with regard to anti-vaxing, capitol rioting, voter frauding, and outright complete disinformation. Reddit should be fine. It would be a tiny neighborhood forum on a moderated site that doesn&#039;t relentlessly data-mine its users.. not a toxic echo chamber of conservative memes and racist tropes on a site created by a sociopath.

				My guess is that in the future we will send video clips of ourselves speaking our comments. Like a combination between YouTube and a forum like this.<br /><br />That will decrease misunderstandings....and will allow folks to immediately gauge...the rational or irrational state of the poster. Also less hiding behind being anonymous. Sure there&#039;ll be filters and voice changers and AI voices and avatars&nbsp; but it&#039;ll make being anonymous more difficult.<br /><br />Looking forward to that. <br /><br />I do agree that this style of a forum has reached its use-by date. It was great.&nbsp; But there will be more visual video ways to interact...and that&#039;ll be exciting. Here&#039;s to the future!

				reading is almost obsolete now, so this concept -- which seems entirely feasible -- could be just the thing we need to dumb things down to the next level, removing the last vestige of literacy from the lives of millions of people whose reading and writing activities are confined to social media and online commentary.

				Yes, but visual literacy and video capabilities of folks is increasing exponentially. These have become sophisticated and often ironic and smart.<br /><br />It&#039;s the future...and it&#039;s exciting...<br /><br />Change is inevitable. And I look forward to it. <br /><br />Meanwhile....<br />&nbsp;<br />I&#039;M AGAINST IT<br />Groucho Marx (One of Grouchoâ€™s most famous comic songs is this one from the 1932 comedy film Horse Feathers.)<br />&nbsp;<br />I don&#039;t know what they have to say<br />It makes no difference anyway<br />Whatever it is, I&#039;m against it<br />No matter what it is or who commenced it<br />I&#039;m against it<br /><br />Your proposition may be good<br />But let&#039;s have one thing understood:<br />Whatever it is, I&#039;m against it<br />And even when you&#039;ve changed it or condensed it<br />I&#039;m against it<br /><br />I&#039;m opposed to it<br />On general principles, I&#039;m opposed to it<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/3cKUppvjJuw<br /><br />

				change for the sake of change is always good. who questions any change to anything is automatically suspect. to that end, we should probably hold national elections monthly. don&#039;t dismiss the idea out of hand due to curmudgeonly tendencies.
