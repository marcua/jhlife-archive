					<strong>Can you answer a few quick questions?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Dear friends and neighbors, when we decided to open The Queensboro, we agreed to make a restaurant that was for the community by the community. <br />&nbsp;<br />We listened to what our neighbors want in a local restaurant, and committed our combined four decades of experience in the industry to create a place where people in Jackson Heights and surrounding neighborhoods could come for delicious food and drinks and friendly service, as well as for community events and special occasions. <br />&nbsp;<br />We would love to hear from you, <a href="https://forms.gle/uCMmEBcqgEMEdSaSA" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">let us know how we’re doing!</a><br />&nbsp;<br />We hope you’ll take one or two minutes to share your honest thoughts about The Queensboro so that we can continue to improve, grow and best serve the community.

					<strong>Aged Salice Salentino!</strong><br /><br />This week we are featuring a dynamic red from Puglia (the heel of Italy’s boot). Cosimo Taurino’s family has been making wines using the ancient grapes of southern Italy for seven generations. His Salice Salentino is made from a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia, which is aged at the winery until it is ready to drink.<br /><br />The “current” vintage is from 2010 and shows a wonderful balance of earthy, spicy and fruit flavors. It&#039;s a wonderful opportunity to savor a wine that has been allowed to properly age, a luxury which has disappeared for most wine drinkers in our modern age.<br /><br />The Queensboro will be featuring the 2010 Salice Salentino by the glass starting Wednesday night. Because of its balance, it matches a range of food - pizza, burgers, pastas- but we especially like it with Chef Tony’s Double-Cut Pork Chop with grilled peaches… delish! Come on down and try and glass- we love it and think you will too!<br /><br />Not only are we offering this wine by the glass today, but if you get a bottle we&#039;ll knock 25% off the price, and as the Italians from Puglia say, <em>&quot;that&#039;s a heel of a deal!&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Thursday at 8:30 - the Teej Trio perform!</strong><br /><br />We have another new local band for everyone to enjoy this Thursday!<br /><br />TJ Adorno is a local guitarist and song writer from Jackson Heights, Queens. He has been active throughout New York&#039;s creative music scene since 2014, performing in genres such as: Jazz, Hip-Hop, Neo Soul, Rock, and more. Also known as TEEJ, he is the frontman and band leader of his projects The SidePocket and TeeJ Tr3o. For more information, booking, or other inquiries, visit teejmusic.com.<br /><br />Fancy checking them out? <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-19&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Make a reservation</a>!<br /><br /><strong>Even more events!<br /></strong><br />We&#039;re always busy at The Q coming up with fun stuff, new food and great drinks. We will go into more details another time but here&#039;s a sneak peek at some upcoming events:<br /><br />Friday - Gallery Opening for the awesome Annabel Poppa, from 6-9PM<br /><br />This weekend - the start of Oktoberfest!<br /><br />Tuesday - A Cheese &amp; Beer night with Stand Alone Cheese Shop!<br /><br />Next Thursday - The inimitable Ed Fuqua and Jim Hershman perform!

					Hi guys, I wanted to see what sort of interest level there would be in establishing a Polar Bear Club Of Queens. For those who don&#039;t know what it is, a Polar Bear club is when you go to the ocean in the middle of winter and jump into the freezing cold water, and then feel pretty amazing for the rest of the day. A lot of people do it on New Year&#039;s Day, and a lot of people do it every weekend during Winter.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done the one in Coney Island in Brooklyn and it was a lot of fun and I&#039;d like to do it again, but I don&#039;t feel like going all the way to Coney Island because a) it&#039;s far and b) Queens is awesome so let&#039;s do it in Queens.<br /><br />I was thinking The Rockaways would be a perfect place for it, maybe some of the food places are open during winter, and I&#039;m pretty sure at least the Rockaway Brewing Company bar would be open which is a good place to get changed afterwards and drink beer. It&#039;s not too far from the water.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be awesome to have a Polar Bear Club Of Queens T-Shirt that says &quot;Polar Bear COQ&quot; on it in big letters? <br /><br />Would this be something people could get behind? Maybe we could do it just on New Year&#039;s Day this year and see if it can grow over time? <br /><br />I welcome your thoughts on this, and if people are interested it would be pretty awesome to spread the word to the rest of the borough and really get it going.

					<strong>Hello JH Life!</strong> You might remember me from posts such as &quot;Hey the Queensboro is coming soon!&quot;&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Well, guess what - it <em>is</em> coming soon, and we are super excited about it.<br /><br />For those of you who might not know the story, myself and two other neighborhood guys have been trying to open up a great neighborhood restaurant/bar for several years. We&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights for years, we&#039;re parents of Jackson Heights kids, and we&#039;re into the Jackson Heights community - I&#039;m part of the JH Green Alliance that helped bring the Rory Staunton field into existence, helped make the 78th Street Plaza a reality, etc... we&#039;re involved in Farm Spot, in our kids&#039; schools, we hang out in the neighborhood and we love it here. <br /><br />We finally found a space, signed the lease, raised some money and started construction, and then ran into delays and roadblocks. We&#039;ve worked our way through them all, and we are finally almost there! Construction is completed, our partnership remains strong, and we have closed out almost all of our permits. It&#039;s difficult to say exactly when we&#039;ll be able to open our doors because the DoB works in mysterious ways, but it&#039;s definitely <em>not </em>a long time away now - a matter of weeks! <br /><br />I must say with all sincerity that it&#039;s looking really great!<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D1CsRC1.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3P1omgd.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d6vf5Xi.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />We&#039;re going to have mostly Queens beers, a delicious range of crafted cocktails, and - what I&#039;m most excited about - amazing food by Chef Tony Liu who has worked as the executive chef in several Keith McNally restaurants. He is the real deal, his food is going to be delicious and exciting, with nods to the neighborhood as well as seasonal dishes using green market ingredients. To give you an idea of what the menu will be, we&#039;re structuring it as an American style neighborhood bistro, and to top it off we have a <strong>monster</strong> pizza oven that&#039;s going to be put to good use, and not just for pizza!<br /><br />We&#039;re going to hire locals as much as possible (almost all of the resumes we&#039;ve gotten so far have been from people who live nearby), we&#039;re keeping the prices reasonable, we&#039;re going to be there for small groups, big groups, parties, special occasions, afternoon snacks, <strong>brunch!!!</strong>, dinner, lunch, quick drinks, slow drinks, late night drinks, romantic dinners, family gatherings, great music at a reasonable volume, a place to hold the meetings for your community group, to plan political action, to impress a date... <br /><br /><strong>But now we need your help, Jackson Heights!</strong><br /><br />All the delays we ran into have been tough, so it would be very helpful to us at this point to get some money to help pay for the last few things that we need. We have in the past asked some close friends to buy gift cards that they can use later - basically paying now for future drinks and food - and we&#039;re widening the net in the hope of raising more funds now. We have also asked for investments from friends and family, if that is something you&#039;d like to find out more about feel free to contact me directly (<a href="mailto:dudley@thequeensboro.com" class="bbc_email">dudley@thequeensboro.com</a>), but if you&#039;re able to help us by purchasing a gift card now, we&#039;d <em>really</em> appreciate it.<br /><br />You can do that here:<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://thequeensboro.com/support/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://thequeensboro.com/support/</a></strong><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll keep an eye on this thread and answer any questions you may have, or anything else that comes up.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Dudley<br /><br />

					Dear friends and neighbors, <br /><br />Some of you may have heard that I am part of a small group that is trying to open a new restaurant to serve our neighborhood. We&#039;ve been searching for an appropriate space over the past year, but as many of you know the market for commercial real estate in our neighborhood is limited and <em>very </em>expensive, making our search a challenge.<br /><br />We&#039;re turning to the JH community to enlist your help!&nbsp; Try as we might, it is simply not possible to be aware of everything that goes on in our neighborhood. Timing is crucial in real estate deals and getting an early tip can be the difference between making a deal and being on the outside looking in. This is why we need your eyes and ears. If you have any leads on a potential space- a business owner looking to sell, a store that is closing, or just the latest for rent sign- please let me know. Your information could be the difference between seeing another dollar store and having the convivial neighborhood institution we all want to see flourish here.<br /><br />In a perfect world, the space would have an existing kitchen, but since the world still isn&#039;t perfect (we’re working on that!), we&#039;re actively considering all opportunities.<br />&nbsp;<br />To give you an idea of what we want to do, what we have in mind is a place that will offer great beers, excellent wines, killer cocktails and delicious food. We&#039;ve been fortunate to line up a highly regarded chef to helm our kitchen and are excited for the opportunity to bring their food to Jackson Heights. This is the kind of place that will keep you local on date night; the kind of place where you can get a quick dinner with the kids without compromising on quality (where is that chicken from exactly?); the kind of place where you can enjoy a quality beverage in an inviting atmosphere, and is above all affordable and welcoming to all. That&#039;s what we want and trust that it’s what <em>you </em>want as well.<br /><br />So please let us know if you hear of anything that we may have missed, thanks!<br /><br />Dudley

					One small gate...<br /><br />It may not seem like much, but the gate pictured below represents years of work by many members of the Jackson Heights community, various community groups and non-profits, tireless support from Council Member Daniel Dromm and Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson, the NYC Department of Parks, and invaluable help from The J.M. Kaplan Fund.<br /><br />All of these worked together for countless hours, trying to prevent the Garden School from selling their lot to a private developer who would build a 10 story apartment building in that space. Instead, we were delighted to announce that the space would be purchased by the Parks Department, who would turn it into an expansion of Travers Park. The purchase made its way through the approval process required by the City and it became official on March 1st, 2013.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img src="https://staticapp.icpsc.com/icp/loadimage.php/mogile/726526/2cfa2002edd59a73ca0e4f01285d51de/image/jpeg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />This space will be open to the public during non-school hours and any public holidays, and the Parks Department will be making improvements to it over the coming months. As we learn about this we will keep you informed.<br /><br />With this new space, and the 78th Street Plaza next to it, Jackson Heights is finally addressing the critical shortage of publicly accessible open space in the neighborhood. The Jackson Heights Green Alliance will continue to work on this issue, if you have any ideas or would like to help us, please let us know.<br /><br />We hope to see you in the new park!<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jhgreen.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhgreen.org</a>

People can stand at these tables with goodies for the kids, and the kids can trick or treat their way up and down the street.<br /><br />Since this is a very last minute thing, we&#039;re going to need some help getting the street ready for this. <br /><br />We&#039;ll need help with:<br /><br />- telling the neighborhood about this<br />- setting the street up tomorrow before the event (just moving some things around, cleaning the storm debris off the street, etc)<br />- putting the tables out <br />- and most importantly, help putting the tables away at the end of the evening!<br /><br />If you can help, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:dudley@jhgreen.org" class="bbc_email">dudley@jhgreen.org</a> &nbsp;(dudley AT jhgreen DOT org) and let me know. <br /><br />The more people who can come, the better this will be, so please tell everyone you know about this!

					Dear Friends &amp; Neighbors, <br /><br /><br />Last year, we asked for your help with the Garden School property.&nbsp; There was enormous concern the school would be forced to sell their athletic field to a real estate developer who would take away some of the last remaining open space in Jackson Heights. Since we came together as a community and worked with our local elected officials, we were successful in getting the City of New York to purchase the land and turn it into park space.<br /><br />Now, Queens is facing a similar threat to open space but on a much larger scale. Flushing Meadows Corona Park is under attack from three large private corporations that are planning on taking dozens of acres of parkland, without paying for it, and building a mall, several parking garages and two new stadiums.<br /><br />For more information, <a href="http://&quot;http://www.jhgreen.org/docs/fmcp_9-21-12_-_queens_triple_play_final_2.pdf&quot;" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">please see this document</a> for a report compiled by the Pratt Center for Community Development on these proposals.<br /><br />We worked so hard to gain just one acre in Jackson Heights. We cannot stand by and allow the Queens flagship park to lose up to 100 acres.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Green Alliance and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group are hosting an emergency Town Hall meeting on Monday, October 1st to discuss these issues and what you can do to help. 82nd Street Academics has arranged for on-site child care.<br /><br />Please tell everybody you know about this and make every effort to attend. In addition to losing park space, these plans will affect us in other ways. A 1,400,000 sq ft mall on Roosevelt Avenue would massively increase traffic and pollution in our neighborhood. This would have a huge negative impact on us all including our property values and the quality of life in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />We need a big turnout to show City officials that we will not accept our parkland being given away to private developers.<br /><br />If you only go to one community event this year, make it this one.<br /><br />EMERGENCY TOWN HALL MEETING<br />on Flushing Meadows Corona Park<br />MONDAY OCTOBER 1ST<br />7:30PM<br />82ND STREET ACADEMICS<br />81-10 35TH AVENUE<br /><br />We look forward to seeing you,<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Green Alliance<br /><br />Donovan Finn<br />Melissa Haldeman<br />Munro Johnson<br />Nadine Kela-Murphy<br />Elena Madison<br />Anthony Ng<br />Georgia Southworth<br />Dudley Stewart
