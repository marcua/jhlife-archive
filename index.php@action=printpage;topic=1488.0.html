				Okay, I really want a great quality, fun, Japanese sushi restaurant. <br /><br />I&#039;ll trade you allaudin sweetmeat, and both halal carts on 73rd (including Sammy&#039;s). I&#039;ll even throw in another biryani joint of your choice. <br />

				I&#039;ll trade all of our Chinese take-out places for one decent Chinese restaurant (with any regional specialization).<br /><br />I&#039;ll throw in unlimited Espresso 77 coffee for a year and all the Cannelle&#039;s pastries you can eat if you add a good Middle Eastern restaurant.<br /><br />Deal?

				Todd, do you ever go down to elmhurst? I still haven&#039;t found &quot;my place&quot;, but theres a lot of contenders with ducks in the windows. Plus quite a few are regional (not cantonese) which still mystify me. Next on my list to try: Pings on Queens blvd for dim sum and Great Wealth on Broadway.

				Yes, there are good places in Elmhurst, but I&#039;m not sure if any deliver to JH.&nbsp; I guess I should look into it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, eating out is not very feasible for me on weeknights, with kids at home.

				Great Wealth on Broadway usually delivers to Jackson Hts. Try the chow fun with beef &quot;dry&quot; or the roast pork on rice is good too.<br /><br />For Turkish we go to the Turkish Grill in Sunnyside, Queens Blvd. 42/43 streets. It&#039;s really good.

I believe the name of the restaurant that occupies its space is called&nbsp; Listo Pollo.&nbsp; It was one of the most popular places in all of Queens.&nbsp; People came from near and far to eat in their beaded booths or have a tropical drink.&nbsp; They actually had another Dragon Seed Restaurant further down 37th Avenue near Junction Blvd. The owner got to old and his children were the success stories of his&nbsp; American dream and didn&#039;t want to run the restaurant anymore.&nbsp; It closed sometime in the mid nineties.&nbsp; I would trade twenty rotisserie chicken places ( We would still have a plenty) to get it back.<br /><br />Eddie

				I can&#039;t believe peking would be that good, looks like every other crappy chinese takeout on earth. I will have to try. <br />the other day I got sesame chicken at east 21 by zabb zabb. the menus are really nice but the sesame chicken was really bad. the girl working there seemed nice, so I will give it one more shot. I think they are not chinese. I won&#039;t get sushi there, how fresh could it be? but maybe cooked japanese foodstuffs . or thai. <br /><br />ill go to peking next time i feel self-destructive again.

				I will trade all of the check cashing places, 3 bodegas, 2 butchers, 2 lingerie stores, 5 cheap clothing stores, 2 grocery stores for one good grocery store and one chain book store. And I would give one fresca tortilla and one taquira tulczingo for one Chipotle.&nbsp;

				Yes, lets leave Chipotle in Manhattan... There is a new Japanese restaurant on 37th btwn 86 and 87. Tomo Sushi, I think its called. I havent been there yet (even though I live 2 steps away) but I did try them at Taste of Jackson Heights, and their sushi was great! Shrimp dumplings were delicious too!
