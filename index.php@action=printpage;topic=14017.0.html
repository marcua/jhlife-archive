				The end is looming for the ornate but decrepit vacant movie theater on 82nd Street, as its soon-to-be new owner plans to demolish it within the next few months.<br /><br />The property, located at 40-31 82nd St., is currently owned by Sona Realty Corp. It is under contract with Sun Equity Partners, according to David Alani of Inline Realty, which is brokering the deal.<br /><br />Sun Equity Partners plans to demolish, rebuild and lease the space.<br /><br />Demolition of the structure is necessary because it is “not salvageable in its current state; it’s too dangerous and not up to code,” Alani said.<br /><br />No demolition permits have yet been filed with the Department of Buildings; Sun Equity Partners director of operations Abe Tress said they plan to file in January.<br /><br />Tress declined to disclose the amount of the property transaction, but explained that it is complicated because Sona Realty has about 13 partners.<br /><br />While the formal closing would not be until April, being under contract means that Sun Equity legally controls the property, Tress said.<br /><br />http://jacksonheightspost.com/demolition-planned-for-defunct-82nd-street-movie-theater/

				Thank you for sharing. I am so disheartened by this news. Despite its recent state of disrepair, the Jackson Triplex is a classic structure. It has been in our neighborhood since before the Great Depression. There must be a way to at least save the exterior; to incorporate it into the developer&#039;s new plans.<br /><br />In the 1960s, Greenwich Village residents saved the Jefferson Market Library structure from being demolished. <br />They almost did not succeed, and we wouldn&#039;t have the beautiful, historic structure that still stands on 6th Ave off W8th St.<br /><br />Architect Lord Norman Foster preserved the exterior of the 1920s Hearst Enterprises bldg on W57th St, when designing the bldg&#039;s extension. I&#039;m sure Hearst&#039;s capital &amp; popularity helped make that happen, but <br />how can we, in little ol&#039; JH, have the developers respect our old structure and preserve it? It&#039;s a link to our past. Who can we appeal to?<br /><br />I&#039;m so tired of seeing classic NY structures demolished right and left. (Just last year, W29th St lost a classic bldg next to Marble Collegiate Church, just to be replaced with a bland modern bldg across from the swanky Ace Hotel.<br />I&#039;ll bet the plans for what we&#039;ll be getting on 82nd St won&#039;t even be swanky!)

				I totally agree.&nbsp; They will probably build some more &quot;Queens Crap&quot;.&nbsp; My heart sank when I was recently on West 57 Street and saw the Art Student League building being smothered by construction to its side and overhead.&nbsp; How is this kind of disrespect for architecture and history stopped?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				There was a large theater in Flatbush Brooklyn that was recently revitalized. It was in a horrific condition and took millions to redo.&nbsp; It&#039;s now a community arts center and totally restored. We&#039;ve had several theaters .....all Art Deco gems that have been destroyed.&nbsp; Even the facade will be lost and replaced with mundane crap.&nbsp; Why do places in Brroklyn get all the attention and financial assistance.

				Absolutely...a versatile purpose built community space/theater there would be awesome...<br /><br />At the moment the Jewish Center on 37th Ave is kinda serving as a community space for the neighborhood...But a full time community space would be great on 82nd St there.<br /><br />Movie houses are closing down all over the world...their market is shrinking...and in truth with new technology inexpensive projectors and online downloading...old fashioned movie houses like this one are like dinosaurs. Doomed. <br /><br />However in a multi purpose space, folks could project movies...as well as have other theatrical community events. That&#039;d be cool.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				The refurbished theater in Brooklyn cost $90 million and was such an exception to the rule of what happens in NY. I really don&#039;t think we should be jealous at all, and rather celebrate it. It was/IS a movie palace and is much greater in so many ways that the 82nd Street theater. The Valencia in Jamaica is now a church (much more profitable than a movie theater). I&#039;ve only seen pictures and heard the tales but the RKO Keith is on a similar level but not as high as the Valencia or the Kings Theater. <br /><br /><br />The 82nd Street is just too good real estate to use as a movie theater. And from what I understand, you can&#039;t force preservation on an owner. It&#039;s definitely an amazing place but it&#039;s a relic. The last owner paid about $1000 A DAY. Always seemed insurmountable to me. <br /><br /><br />You can see a list of movie palaces here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_palace

				I agree w/ Jeffsayyes you cant force developers, but you an provide tax and zoning incentives to ensure that meaningful and useful economic development occurs within communities.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its takes bold leadership and creativity to ensure this type of development can occur.&nbsp; Unfortunately, rarely are their effective arbitrators to ensure a true balance between communities and development, and profit and essential services.<br /><br />Hopefully the DOE or the City jumps on this opportunity with Sun Equity, if an alternative solution is not found with regard to preservation.<br /><br />From the Jackson Heights Post<br /><br /><em>&quot;Alani said Sun Equity wants to bring in a combination of national retailers and local mom and pop shops and that several local businesses have already reached out and shown strong interest. They are open to community suggestions and are “trying to bring tenants that will improve the neighborhood,” he added.<br /><br />If a larger tenant, such as a school or hospital shows an interest, Sun Equity Partners may consider creating a community-use building, up to six stories as opposed to only two, and housing classrooms or medical offices on the upper floors. Tress said that the basement may be used for retail.<br /><br />Alani said that Sun Equity has reached out to the Department of Education to see about putting in a public school or charter school, as well as Elmhurst hospital.&quot;</em><br />
