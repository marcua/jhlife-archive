				Unfortunately, most car honking violations are usually tossed by the judge, so they aren&#039;t worth the time to ticketing officers. I believe it&#039;s really hard to prove by the ticketing officer, who was actually honking their horn. Unless of course he actually witnesses it, and wants to be bothered writing one up.

				A few months back, a young lady had her hand on the car horn for so long that I was able to wait for my elevator, go down 5 floors, walk outside past two stores and see who was making all the noise. She said she was trying to reach her husband and that his phone wasn&#039;t working. Had she not thought of walking up to his place of work and knocking on the door?<br /><br />I think the honking issue has a lot to do with respect for others. If I am driving at night, I always assume people are sleeping so I don&#039;t honk unless it&#039;s vital. People these days must think it&#039;s the NYC thing to do, to honk whenever they get stuck behind a car or when they want to grab someone&#039;s attention. I don&#039;t understand this! But what REALLY bugs me are the ignorant drivers who sit behind others honking and honking and honking when clearly the cars in front of them can&#039;t move (due to an emergency vehicle in the way, a delivery truck unloading, a person crossing the road etc.). Drivers (and everyone else) need to understand that the world does not revolve around them. Have some goddamn patience!

				I live on 80th Street between 37th and 35th Avenues and there&#039;s a lot of honking on my street, day and night, but especially on Saturday and Sunday. And I discovered the main reason is that cars and trucks double park on 37th and clog up traffic flow and so drivers think honking will help. I think if the traffic agents were more aggressive in cracking down on double parking on the avenue it would&nbsp; decrease slogs on the side street -- and honking.

				am315 is right. The traffic agents don&#039;t do shit. BUT, I&#039;ve seen people threaten and harass the ticket agents before, so maybe they&#039;re too scared to do their job sometimes.

				4:30 AM! This time I saw who was honking 5 times in the middle of residental neighborhood!! USPS big truck! Extremely loud. How can I complain? I know we live in a big city, I really don&#039;t mind noise in general, but this is so disrespectful.

				Moving one block over (73rd to 74th) has made a huge difference in my quality of life. Now it&#039;s just &quot;normal&quot; levels of city noise -<br />&nbsp;sure I hear honking but it&#039;s not nearly as bad now. <br /><br />European and BEB, I highly recommend sleeping with some sort of sound/white noise machine.&nbsp; It saved my sanity when I lived on 73rd.

The Marpac is the old standby and has a slightly more pleasant sound, but the Lectro Fan is super powerful. I know it sounds strange that I know so much about white noise machines when I said traffic noise doesn&#039;t bother me due to a garden-facing unit, but I can get woken by pretty much anything, including rain drops on an a/c, so I do use the white noise machines.

				I live on 82nd and 34th Ave, just a block away from the fire station on Northern. In addition to the honking, we get fire truck sirens and during the school year we have a crossing guard who uses her whistle all day (the mornings are tough hearing her whistle). <br /><br />Has anyone had soundproofing windows installed? If so and you live in a coop, what was the process like? Thanks in advance!

				Here&#039;s one remedy for incessant horn honking that I found very effective:<br />--Go out a buy a bullhorn. They sell for something like $15.<br />--Whenever the noise gets out of control, open your window and using the bullhorn say, &quot;Stop honking your horn! We live here!&quot;<br /><br />You&#039;d be amazed how drivers stop honking when they&#039;re called out like that. I have done this numerous times and it has always worked. My neighbors probably don&#039;t love it but calling 311 is useless. The only way to battle the noise is to embarrass the drivers.<br /><br />Btw, I do the same thing to people who decide to stand outside my building talking on their cellphones on the top of their lungs all night.<br />
