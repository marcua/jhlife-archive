				AOC blocked a Target store but we are getting a chick fil a ? <br /><br />This is from Wikipedia:<br /><br />In June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A&#039;s chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who &quot;have the audacity to define what marriage is about&quot; were &quot;inviting God&#039;s judgment on our nation&quot;.[71] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[72] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco &quot;Joe&quot; Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[73] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[74] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids&#039; meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[75] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns had arisen prior to the controversy.[76] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, &quot;We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.&quot;[77]<br /><br />In response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[78][79][80] The United States Federal Aviation Administration also responded to two cities that were preventing Chick-fil-A from opening in their international airport, citing &quot;Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding.&quot;[81]<br /><br />In April 2018, Chick-fil-A reportedly continued to donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes gay marriage.[7][82][83] In a November 18, 2019 interview, Chick-fil-A president Tim Tassopoulos said the company would stop donating to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.[84][85]<br /><br />
