				Hi,<br /><br />My name is Stew. I have been a resident of Jackson Heights for 14 years and I am opening a restaurant in the neighborhood.<br /><br />We&#039;ll be offering contemporary American cooking. The current plan is for the restaurant to be open nightly for dinner, Thursday and Friday for lunch, and Saturday and Sunday for brunch. The interior will be modern, but not formal, and the restaurant will accommodate about 50 guests. Despite not wanting the atmosphere to be formal, service will be highly professional and unobtrusive.<br /><br />The restaurant will be at 76-05 37th Avenue. I&#039;ll be taking possession of the space on Monday. While the address is currently a restaurant, I&#039;ve been working with a designer, architect and contractor on renovations. These will will be extensive and take some months to complete. We hope to open by mid-September.<br /><br />This is a gamble based on the belief that Jackson Heights will support a restaurant that is unlike anything that currently exists in the neighborhood, and on the belief that it is possible to create a restaurant here that will attract New Yorkers from other parts of the city.<br /><br />We will be working very hard to prove that those beliefs are well-founded.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this,<br /><br />Stew

				Fantastic!&nbsp; I wish you every success.&nbsp; My only advice is to find a way to welcome families with kids.&nbsp; &nbsp;This may not be a requirement in other parts of the city, but is certainly very helpful here.<br /><br />For those keeping score at home, over the past decade we&#039;ve seen this address evolve from a franchise (Baskin Robbins) to a sporadically excellent locally-owned restaurant (Mehfil) to a mediocre nationwide chain (Paradise Biryani Pointe) to this new local venture with high ambitions.&nbsp; Hopefully local can win this time.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to September!

				that sounds like a great concept and i certainly look forward to visiting and dining there -- easy enough since it&#039;s only a block away from our place. happy to hear about the location for that reason, and, to be honest, because you&#039;re taking over from a place that i never warmed to (when your colleague initially mentioned taking over from an existing restaurant, i crossed my fingers that it wouldn&#039;t be any of several places i do like).<br /><br />best wishes for the renovation/build-out.

				FANTASTIC<br /><br />We need a new restaurant that is a nice place to visit.<br /><br />Yes being family friendly would be great. <br />Delivery would also be really great.<br /><br />Good luck and will definitely visit once you are open.

				You should talk to the owner/chef of Woodside&#039;s Casa Del Chef.&nbsp; He often builds his menus from produce he buys at our Farmer&#039;s market.&nbsp; FYI Casa de Chef is by far the best restaurant within walking distance of Jackson Heights.

				We just returned tonight from Pio Pio. Love that place!<br /><br />The menu is limited, yes. But each item is delicious. <br />We never wait for a table. <br />The Sangria - spiked with Brandy - is delicious. We probably spend more on drinks than food.<br />We eat out every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.<br />We don&#039;t have kids.<br />We don&#039;t like to go to restaurants that cater to families. Yet we are never bothered by kids at Pio Pio. Why is that? I don&#039;t know. But do that!<br />We don&#039;t go to restaurants that have TVs.<br />We don&#039;t always eat in the neighborhood.

				Someone who likes Pio Pio may enjoy your restaurant.&nbsp; Look forward to hearing more about it and the menu.&nbsp; I am sure you would welcome all.&nbsp; As far as family friendly--not sure what that means really.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am fine going to nice restaurants with families when the parents make sure their kids behave and don&#039;t disturb other diners.&nbsp; There is the iHop and are two Chuck e Cheese restaurants in Queens a short drive from Jackson Heights.&nbsp; But, seriously this and the new Queensboro restaurant slated for Northern Blvd. is exciting news for the culinary scene in the &#039;hood.&nbsp; Also looking forward to trying the Casa del Chef in nearby Woodside.&nbsp; Good luck with the opening!

				<br />Best of Luck with everything Stew, will be a great addition to our &#039;hood !<br /><br />And although it will not be a formal establishment, may I humbly suggest to please consider your restaurant lighting to have an ambience, there are so many dining establishments in our &#039;hood that do not consider this, I am a firm believer the right lighting draws people in! After the great food ofcourse :)

The reason that the renovations will take a few months is that we&#039;re replacing the existing flooring, walls and ceiling. We&#039;ll also be building a small bar that can accommodate about seven guests.<br /><br />Like everyone else, I have design ideas, but this is a job for a professional. We&#039;ve taken the unorthodox route of hiring a production/stage designer from the NY theater world. We had our second meeting yesterday and lighting was very much part of the discussion. On Monday, which is when I take over the premises, he&#039;ll be dropping by for a tour of the space and of the Jackson Heights neighborhood. He has a copy of the Landmarks Preservation Commission&#039;s study.<br /><br />Lighting, floors, walls, ceiling, bar, bathrooms, furniture, art ... lots to do but very exciting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is all great news and very. Exciting. I wish you the best of luck. From the things you are saying it seems you&#039;re on the right track. Personally I don&#039;t think kid-friendly should be a priority. But decor, lighting and service will indeed make a difference and please don&#039;t forget attention to careful selection of music that makes the mood and shows some thought, creativity and sense of fun. All obvious things in other neighborhoods but still a rarity here. But hopefully not for long. Good luck.

				I love the design process and thought I&#039;d share this. I call it an inspiration collage, although in current parlance it might be called a mashup. It&#039;s the result of a meeting yesterday to come up with ideas for materials, textures, and a color palette. We used lots of sources, from photos to a 1930s poster by A.M. Cassandre for Maison Prunier, a Paris restaurant I trained at, to the colors of a favorite tie. I couldn&#039;t be happier with our designer, and I&#039;m looking forward to the journey from here to the final design.<br /><br />(http://kissthecod.com/jh800.jpg)

				just to clarify/defend my suggestion about music in the restaurant.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely not suggesting loud, distracting music--anything but that.&nbsp; In fact, I am a musician who has sacrificed a bit of my hearing to my vocation and the last thing I want is too much ambient noise interfering with good conversation and good friends.&nbsp; Nope, that&#039;s no good.&nbsp; I&#039;m just suggesting that an attention to music that suggests a time and place, a vibe, an attention to atmosphere and ambience--be it Nick Drake, be it Max Roach, be it Delroy Wilson, be it Patsy Cline, whatever--is preferable to just playing the radio or Pandora (or, heaven forbid, a blasting TV).&nbsp; Just the feeling that the proprietor took the time to invent another world, an escape, an oasis, a good time for the customer.&nbsp; And then, yes, keep it at an acceptable volume.&nbsp; Okay, enough on that.<br /><br />But it is a good time to suggest the frustrations and semi-failures of Arunee.&nbsp; And I welcome any attacks on my opinion here.&nbsp; It seemed so great when it opened--nice decor in particular.&nbsp; But it was something that already existed before, doing something that at least 4 other restaurants (Ayada, Zabb Elee, Playground, Kitchen 79) do better and then added spotty service and, by some reports, outright rudeness.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s just sad when something comes so close but doesn&#039;t get there.&nbsp; Stew, from everything you&#039;re saying, I feel that you get it.&nbsp; And I&#039;m looking forward to your restaurant.

I love the sound it produces, and it would look amazing behind our little bar. We just have to find out whether it&#039;s powerful enough to deliver music for the space. And yes, we plan to use uncompressed recordings, not .mp3, although we don&#039;t have an unlimited budget, including for speakers. There&#039;s going to be some tradeoff, but we want to deliver music that our customers will enjoy at a volume that is not distracting, let alone earsplitting :)<br /><br />

				I&#039;m so excited you&#039;re paying attention to lighting, and those floor tiles look fantastic. Even before I was a hag, I would walk out of a restaurant if it was too brightly lit. I can&#039;t do that in Jackson Heights because everything is lit up like an operating room.

				I was just today peering into the windows of Biryani Pointe and hoping they were actually closed for good--and now I find this thread! This is just terrific. We moved to JH in October 2011 and were delighted to find Mehfil, the restaurant that was formerly in that space. We live just around the corner, and we loved Mehfil. <br /><br />Then it closed and was replaced by that chain and instead of the fairly nice atmosphere and vibe of Mehfil—and food we really enjoyed—we had the glaring lights, the TV, the ugly Coke machine in the dining room. Then, even worse, that garish chicken place opened in a former dry cleaning shop. I almost cried when I saw it. I don&#039;t care who you are or what you are selling—a little sense of aesthetics, please! By comparison, on the same block a similarly casual mostly breakfast and lunch place, El Rico Tinto, has pleasing decor, good food and friendly service. That was a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Their egg dishes are great for brunch.<br /><br />I am thrilled to hear about your new restaurant, Stew. By family friendly, people probably mean having menu items children would eat (some simple choices like roast chicken or a good hamburger) and not having an atmosphere so formal that parents would feel uncomfortable bringing their children. It looks to me like you do want to be more on the formal/fine dining side and less on the casual family dining side, which to me is a place like Bare Burger. <br /><br />I agree that it&#039;s crucial to make sure the acoustics and music allow for conversation. One of the things I liked about Armondo&#039;s was that it was not too noisy and was a relaxing place to eat basic Italian comfort food.&nbsp; I&#039;m at the stage of life where I will leave a restaurant that is too noisy before even sitting down. I just can&#039;t scream all night and I really dislike the constant, headache-inducing clamor. Everyone I know (granted I don&#039;t hang out with kids) feels the same way. Even if I am dining alone, I hate when it&#039;s too noisy.<br /><br />Arunee is an example of a place that is too loud for my taste, and I think that&#039;s from the choice of decor. It was not so loud in its former incarnation, Novo, to my recollection. I also find the uncushioned wooden bench seating uncomfortable--and the food, unfortunately, went downhill after the move. Not that I went there more than a few times, but I liked it more when it was in its former location.<br /><br />Your mood board looks great. Do you have a name? I think this will do well (especially if it&#039;s not TOO formal and upscale, which I am not sure would work as well here). I think there is pent-up demand for this kind of a place. Really looking forward to your opening!

				I just want to clarify my earlier recommendation that the restaurant &quot;find a way to welcome families with kids.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;As an occasional grown-up myself who enjoys a fine meal when I can afford it, I am thrilled that Stew is trying to create a pleasing atmosphere for grown-ups.&nbsp; I am certainly not advocating that Stew bend his ambitious vision into a kid-oriented family restaurant.&nbsp; But a couple of simpler, less-fancy menu options would make it easier for families to attend.&nbsp; While older kids are quite capable of behaving appropriately at sophisticated restaurants, their palates are not always fully mature.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stew and redge sound like they know what they&#039;re doing and are about to bring us something wonderful.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just pipe down now and wait patiently!

				Add me to the list of JH residents pining for a restaurant just like the one your proposing - We can&#039;t wait to come!<br /><br />Since you were talking about music earlier in the thread, may I request that you consider some live music one or two (or more) nights a week? We used to love to go to Novo and hear Jim play guitar on Mondays, either solo, duo or trio. That experience it&#039;s another one that is sorely lacking in this neighborhood. <br /><br />Either way, we wish you the best and will be there in September!

				Stew:<br /><br />Many people have been commenting on the inside.. here is my two cents on the outside.&nbsp; I am almost certain that you will remove the ugly light-box sign above the horrible illuminated sign/awning/box.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, that lovely limestone building has a black and green marble sign band above the show window.&nbsp; It may still be there behind that awful sign/awning. I think the lettering (for the store name) was originally in gold, and the stores likely had a canvas awning projecting from below the sign band.&nbsp; I know you are likely sandwiched between huge and garish signs and awnings, but perhaps you can be the start of the resurrection of this commercial building - by installing a sign and awning that befit the building and your business.&nbsp; It may be worth a shot to see if the sign band is still there after all these years, and use it if it is somewhat intact.&nbsp; I know you have your hands full with starting up a business, but maybe we can get some concerned Hawthorne Ct residents to reach out to the property owner and see if he can have his (non-landmarked, unfortunately) commercial tenants install uniform signs and awnings that will enhance, rather than detract, both their business and the value of his building.&nbsp; One can only hope that this is a start.....&nbsp; I predict success for you.

My understanding is that the building dates from 1948. It&#039;s a pretty straightforward semi-art deco design (curved block ends) with no visible ornamentation. We have been unsuccessful in finding any photographs except for a tax photo that shows, without detail, only the entire block from a distance. For that matter, we have thus far had no luck finding period photographs showing 37th Avenue storefronts. Where did you come across the above info?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				jhlifer,<br /><br />You&#039;ve got me speeded up to find out what&#039;s under the signage. When I first looked at the building, I was struck by the fact that, while of more or less art deco design, there was no ornamentation. A marble band at sign height would make complete sense, and I have little doubt that originally there were awnings.<br /><br />Right now, that block, and many others on 37th, have signage that is based on the principle that more is more. As you know, when one looks closely at a number of the building fronts on 37th, architectural details have been completely obscured in the race to have the most prominent sign, tasteful or not.<br /><br />We&#039;ve already decided that we&#039;re not going to compete with the signage on the block, so if there&#039;s something there that we can work with, all the better.<br /><br />We&#039;re also considering replacing the entire front (currently all glass with a glass door in the center), although this is going to be a matter of priorizing within our budget.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Stew, for historical photographs, have you tried contacting Daniel Karatzas, local realtor and author of a history of the neighborhood? He gives a yearly slide show of historical photographs of Jackson Heights on the day of the annual JHBG garden tour. I would think he&#039;d be a good source on photos, as I believe he spent years researching his book. <br /><br />Regarding the suggestion about trying to appeal to the landlord for uniform signage on that block— does one landlord own the entire block? Someone mentioned getting Hawthorne Ct residents to work on this--I&#039;m a Hawthorne Ct resident and would love to do anything I can to improve 37th Avenue. Other blocks on the avenue seem to have installed uniform signage. Is this something that the landlord initiates? How does it happen and why has it happened on other blocks but not this one, I wonder.

Evidently, Frank Meier, head barman at the Ritz Bar, had been mixing his famous Tomato Juice Cocktail for years. But his recipe was missing one fundamental ingredient: booze! At Harry’s American Bar in Paris, barman Ferdinand “Pete” Petiot made the Bloody Mary with vodka. The name, according to Duncan McElhone (son of Andy McElhone, the original storyteller and owner of Harry’s), came into being because of the continued appearance at the bar of a woman named Mary, who was regularly left waiting for her man, nursing one of Pete’s tomato cocktails. A comparison was made between the imprisonment of Mary, Queen of Scots, and young Mary’s long, solitary hours at the bar.<br /><br />Pete worked at Harry’s from 1919 to 1936, until the Astor family, loyal customers of his, convinced him to head the bar staff at their St. Regis hotel in New York. When he arrived at the King Cole Bar, he introduced the drink to New Yorkers with gin, since vodka was not yet available in the United States, and changed the name to the Red Snapper at the behest of the Astors.<br /><br />John Martin, grandson of Heublein founder Andrew Martin, used the drink as a vehicle to promote a new product, Smirnoff vodka in the 1960s. This led to an almost exclusive use of vodka in the drink, and helped to make it the de rigeur morning-after cocktail.<br /><br /><strong>Bloody Mary</strong><br /><br />There’s something about the Bloody Mary that makes people competitive. Every weekend bartender in America has his own, and of course, his is the best recipe in Western civilization. But this is really the best recipe. A dash of celery salt is a nice touch, and New Yorkers traditionally add horseradish. The Bloody Mary offers rich ground for improvisation both in garnish and ingredients. Have fun.<br /><br />1 ½ ounces vodka<br />2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce<br />4 dashes of Tabasco sauce<br />Pinch of salt and pepper<br />¼ ounce fresh lemon juice<br />4 ounces tomato juice<br /><br />Combine all the ingredients in a mixing glass and roll back and forth to mix. Strain into a large goblet or pint glass three quarters filled with ice. Garnish with the lemon and lime wedges on a side plate.<br /><br /><strong>Bloody Caesar</strong><br /><br />This Canadian import is a wonderful change from the ordinary. Use the Bloody Mary (above), but omit the salt. Instead of regular tomato juice, use 3 ounces tomato with 2 ounces clam juice. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				Very exciting.&nbsp; I am going to guess that your restaurant will be extremely successful, and along with lockwood, will help usher in a new renaissance on 37th avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have some such wonderful entrepreneurs like the folks at table wine, espresso 77, inner peace, saw shack and happy family, who care about the neighborhood, the quality of their products, the appearance of their store and the diversity their business brings.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s time for the next wave, to continue that line of thinking i think.<br /><br />There are a lot of naysayers who believe that the demographics of this neighborhood is the reason there Are so many eyeglass stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, hoochie mama, etc.<br /><br />I hope you can prove them wrong.<br /><br />

				Some conclusions after poking around the space today...<br /><br />I suspect that behind what are likely several layers of vinyl is a hardwood floor.<br /><br />I also suspect that behind the drywall ceiling, the sole apparent purpose of which is to support dozens of cheap recessed lights, is an original ceiling.<br /><br />Returning tomorrow with tools to carry out some measured destruction. <br /><br />There&#039;s nothing more fun than a bit of architectural sleuthing :)

As jhlifer has pointed out, there are architectural details on the facade of this building that have been hidden for decades. <br /><br />We now think that that extends to the interior. The first clue was a bit of graded concrete from the sidewalk to the entrance that suggests that the floor is at a higher level than originally; as in, layers of vinyl over something else, hopefully hardwood.<br /><br />Given the utilitarian drywall ceiling supporting recessed lighting (trendy before track lighting became trendy), there&#039;s also a pretty good chance that there&#039;s an original ceiling that has also been hidden for decades.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#039;re going to find out in the next couple of days.<br /><br />The glass facade is also obviously unoriginal. If anybody has information on the facade of this building (apart from the marble band that jhlifer has already pointed out), or similar buildings, it would be appreciated. Especially photographs.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I spent the afternoon at Paul dePoo&#039;s studio making design decisions. We&#039;re pretty close to final. Here&#039;s a photo that Paul posted to Instagram that shows some of the drawings we were going through: https://instagram.com/p/3RsELwNJMy/.<br /><br />Our application for a license to serve beer, wine and spirits will be considered by the Community Board for Jackson Heights on Tuesday evening. If the Board concurs, the application will then go to the New York State Liquor Authority.<br /><br />I spent part of today asking neighboring merchants for their support, and will be canvassing merchants tomorrow and through the weekend. I&#039;m pleased to say that Arunee Thai, Espresso 77 and Table Wine are among the businesses that gave their support today. <br /><br />

				About the Queensboro: I have never seen any activity there--has there been any progress? Maybe I only go past at off hours. Looking forward to both new restaurants and especially Stew&#039;s, because it&#039;s less than a block from our apartment and what could be better? <br /><br />I also think it will elevate the whole block amazingly, although there already are some good food options. We love El Rico Tinto and we also think Due Fratelli has good pizza and Italian comfort food like chicken parm. We order from both places often. We also love the K&amp;L deli on the corner for deli-type things and basic, inexpensive takeout. <br /><br />But to have a really good restaurant in that spot again (we were fans of the late Mehfil) will be so great. And from the sound of it, this will be a unique offering in this neighborhood. Quite different from anything that&#039;s been seen here before. It&#039;s high time we got something like this in JH. I think it will be a big hit.

				Last night we made a presentation to our Community Board&#039;s Business and Economic Development Committee. I was impressed, in particular, by one member&#039;s knowledge of the building and its design. The Committee had a private discussion after we left, but as far as I can tell there is not going to be an objection to us offering wine, beer and spirits. Next stop is the New York State Liquor Authority.<br /><br />There <em>was</em> some discussion about live music. I mention this because musicians have raised the issue in this thread. We have no plan to offer live music, but can see doing it in special cases. For example, if we were hosting a fundraiser for the Jackson Heights Orchestra, a performance by a soloist, duo or trio would seem obvious.<br /><br />Tomorrow I&#039;ll be getting together with our designer, architect and contractor to get the renovation on track. One of the questions during the Committee hearing is whether we are serious about opening early fall. The kitchen is approved, so this is a cosmetic renovation of a 626 square foot dining room. It is entirely possible. <br /><br />The other question that came up during the Committee hearing was whether we are prepared to open without a liquor license, indeed without a wine and beer license. I can&#039;t imagine doing that. This is going to be a serious restaurant and it is inconceivable to me that a guest could not order a cocktail, a beer, an aperitif, wine or a digestif. <br /><br />I have some concern that this last question has something to do with the fact (as I understand it) that the full Community Board does not intend to meet again until September. If that is true, the Board needs to understand that we and several other applicants last night are paying rent month after month.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				i understand your position. i&#039;ve experienced a number of openings where a restaurant offered a complimentary glass of wine before a license was secured, and gone to a number of BYOB places, which i know is a grey area when a license hangs in the balance. if you&#039;re looking at a short term &quot;dry&quot; period, i wouldn&#039;t imagine it would be a problem, but that&#039;s your decision, clearly.

				One other point.<br /><br />When we went into the Committee meeting, we introduced ourselves.<br /><br />Assuming that our Community Board&#039;s list of members is correct, there are nine members of this Committee. Six were present. Having asked when we arrived, we were told that it may not be correct. I have no idea who was present. Not one of them introduced themselves. This really took me aback. It is a matter of basic manners.<br /><br />I would like to know who the guy was who knew a lot about the building, and had a quick grasp of the application, but it&#039;s kind of awkward, when one is appearing before a Committee, to ask members to identify themselves. <br /><br />Meanwhile, our Community Board web site has data on Jackson Heights liquor licenses, but the information has not been updated for five years.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I wasn&#039;t there and have very limited experience with the Community Board, but I can hazard an (optimistic) guess at why they were asking about whether you can open without a license.<br /><br />First, like many CBs, they do not meet during July and August unless an urgent matter arises.&nbsp; Second, it has been the recent tradition of this CB to hold its June meeting outdoors in Diversity Plaza.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a wonderful civic event.&nbsp; This year, it&#039;s scheduled for June 18 (http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/calendar?c_v=evt&amp;c_eid=1590342&amp;c_mid=0). But it means in the case of rain, any scheduled business is put off until September.&nbsp; I attended a committee meeting before the outdoor meeting last year, and there were similar questions asked about continencies in case the June meeting is cancelled due to weather.&nbsp; &nbsp;So it&#039;s <em>possible</em> that is what they were talking about.&nbsp; &nbsp;They should have been more clear.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We have no plan to offer live music</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Shucks.&nbsp; I was harboring a fantasy that Great Big Sea would pop down from St. John&#039;s for an intimate little show.

				Toddg,<br /><br />I have zero patience for people who don&#039;t have the courtesy to identify themselves and who expect me, when they have no objection to what I&#039;m proposing, to pay thousands of dollars in rent every month to suit their vacation plans. <br /><br />Our brilliant Community Board Committee said things last night that suggested that there is no prospect of Great Big Sea playing in our restaurant.

				We intend to open a contemporary American fine/casual restaurant in September/October in Jackson Heights at which our clients can order cocktails, aperitifs, wine, beer, and digestifs. <br /><br />We have notified the Community Board and the next stop is the New York State Liquor Authority. <br /><br />If the Community Board objects to a modern American restaurant in Jackson Heights, or objects to such a restaurant serving beer, wine and spirits, it should say so now.<br /><br />It&#039;s ridiculous that I went to a Community Board Committee meeting last night where not a single person identified themselves nor, with one exception, seemed to have a clue what we are proposing. <br /><br />

				That&#039;s discouraging but not surprising. Welcome to local politics. It&#039;s not ideal, but I think it&#039;s quite common for restaurants in NYC to open without a liquor license at first. At least I have seen that often. Lots of places in that position do allow BYOB--so much so that I had no idea it was illegal until recently. It may be one of those realities you just have to put up with, unfortunately. These places eventually do get their license, but they operate without one for several months. I always thought that was just the way things happened--that it just took a long time to get the license.

				Here&#039;s another question.<br /><br />On Wednesday night, the Board&#039;s Business Committee invited each applicant into its presence privately, and when the applicant left, the Committee held a private discussion before the next applicant entered.<br /><br />Why is this a private process?<br /><br />We would have preferred that our application was considered publicly. We were surprised at the secrecy and found it distasteful, not to mention wholly unnecessary. It&#039;s an application for a liquor license, not a national security issue.

				On a lighter note...<br /><br />Mica, my three month old Miniature Schnauzer, comes along when I meet our designer, Paul dePoo, at his studio. <br /><br />I&#039;m not generally keen on selfies, but I love this one that Paul posted today to Instagram: https://instagram.com/p/3q1QSENJEJ/<br /><br />Means that Mica will have a King Charles Spaniel playmate while Paul is &quot;babysitting&quot;.<br /><br />By the way, Paul, who is a stage designer first but is also the designer of our restaurant, correctly called both of last night&#039;s Tony awards for stage design: The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (play) and Fun Home (musical).

				As some may know, we have a fairly new online news source called Jackson Heights Post.<br /><br />The principal journalist is 2013 Queens College graduate Michael Florio (JHPost here) who has just published an article about our upcoming restaurant: http://jacksonheightspost.com/frenchamerican-restaurant-to-open-on-37th-avenue/

				I&#039;m really happy to pass on that our designer, Paul dePoo, will be the set designer for a new Broadway-bound musical about Josephine Baker.<br /><br />The producer, Kenneth Waissman, is perhaps best known for Grease and Torch Song Trilogy. <br /><br />The play will initially open in Sarasota&#039;s Asolo Theater next April and will star Deborah Cox.

				We had lots of people drop by the restaurant today as they were passing, including some of the people who follow this forum. It&#039;s really encouraging, and chatting for a few minutes makes for a great break from the messy work we were doing.<br /><br />As of this evening, we&#039;ve completed demo work in the basement, and the main floor has been stripped to its base. Over the next few days, the current ceiling and the outdoor signage will be gone. There is no need to strip the walls. <br /><br />Then we can begin putting the space together as we envisage it. <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to confirm that we have decided to replace the current facade. <br /><br /><br /><br />

As it turns out, there is no original wooden floor and no original ceiling, so we&#039;ll be going with our designer&#039;s concept on both. This means ceramic tile for the floor and a lattice effect, geared toward sound absorption as well as aesthetics, for the ceiling.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Stew, I wish you the best of luck, yet you seem to be applying a double standard.&nbsp; You are defending your investor&#039;s attack on a Community Board member for posting about board business anonymously, and now you are leveling the same criticism.&nbsp; Yet your investor anonymously criticised a new neighborhood restaurant without revealing that he has sunk money into another new neighborhood restaurant and then he anonymously attacked the Community Board&#039;s liquor license process without revealing that the restaurant he put money into has, or will have, a liquor license application before the board.&nbsp; Full disclosure runs both ways.<br /><br />This is a nice neighborhood and most of us hope your place will be a nice addition.&nbsp; This forum allows people to express their opinions anonymously.&nbsp; That&#039;s how it operates.&nbsp; Moreover, Community Board members donate their time on behalf of the neighborhood fulfilling an important civic function.&nbsp; They have the same right to express their opinions, anonymously, as the rest of us.&nbsp; They shouldn&#039;t be penalized just because they volunteer their time to the community.&nbsp; In any event, isn&#039;t it time we move beyond this and look forward to your grand opening.

				Hi kmjh,<br /><br />I think that the real problem is that, to this minute, in relation to a discussion about my business, a member of our Community Board is hiding behind a fake name and refuses to admit publicly that he or she is a member of the Board.<br /><br />The bigger problem is that our Community Board, consisting of public officials who are supposed to be publicly accountable, apparently thinks that it&#039;s perfectly OK for its members to conduct themselves in this manner. <br /><br />And the even bigger problem is that the politicians who appoint these people - start with the Querns Borough President - are silent.

				So kmjh, apparently this is how Jackson Heights politics works...<br /><br />If one is starting a business, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment, that will create jobs, whatever one does, don&#039;t question how our Community Board does business. <br /><br />If you do, expect a member of the Board to use a pseudonym, and to pretend that he or she is just an ordinary citizen, to attack you on a personal ad hominem level for raising questions. <br /><br />Then expect the owners of this site, and certain participants, to explain that this is how democracy is supposed to work.<br /><br />No doubt Donald Trump could explain this.<br /><br />P.S. I intend to run my restaurant based on a set of values. This means that I reject the Restsurant Association&#039;s position on minimum wage. It also means that I have no time for our Community Board members hiding in the weeds; nor for the Board&#039;s complete lack of transparency.

While we are hiring on merit, and I know at this point that there are several people who want to work with us from other boroughs, I hope that many of the people working with us will be from our Jackson Heights community. We believe that we will be competitive in hiring because we intend to pay people higher than the New York minimum wage and, in particular, to pay our kitchen staff at rates that we believe will be higher than New York generally and certainly higher than most restaurants in Jackson Heights, and likely higher than all of them.<br /><br />

				Stew, I&#039;m really looking forward to your restaurant opening. I know things with the community board are annoying, but they always are. Power—even when there&#039;s laughably little of it—corrupts. I had to rely on one in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn and it nearly gave me an aneurysm. Yes, it&#039;s infuriating, but you&#039;ll get through it. I third and fourth everyone&#039;s advice to avoid lashing out on this board. Most people reading this don&#039;t comment and showing your anger here isn&#039;t helping you. <br /><br />I get how hard it is to avoid taking this personally, when you&#039;ve sunk so much of yourself into it. But it&#039;s really not personal. It&#039;s small town politics in a big city. It&#039;s annoying, petty and stupid, but you will prevail. You are providing a service the neighborhood desperately needs. Please post links to your help-wanted ads. If you need a social media advisor or copywriter, I know someone who&#039;d be perfect!

				I think Stew&nbsp; that some of the negative feelings you may be detecting on this board stem from before your challenges with the community board. <br /><br />Before you began posting, hints of your restaurant were being dropped by your investor.&nbsp; He would comment often, and sometimes his tone seemed a bit condescending. <br /><br />One particularly memorable post involved a thread about the reopening of Armondos.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you like it or not, it is a long-standing establishment in Jackson Heights, which I&#039;m pretty sure just about everyone has been to at one time.&nbsp; The thread was basically about support and excitement on it&#039;s reopening.<br /><br />One notable voice of dissent was your investor. I don&#039;t remember exactly what he said, but what I took away was that he thought their food was swill. And then he went further to add that if this is what Jackson Heights residents consider good food, then maybe they don&#039;t&nbsp; deserve a higher quality restaurant and that maybe he should focus his attention more towards Manhattan rather than Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Do you see Stew, how such a comment could be seen as off-putting?<br /><br />As a musician, I&#039;ve learned that no one wants to hear about the behind-the-scenes drama. They want to associate you and your endeavors with having a good time and creating new memories. <br /><br />I am looking forward to try your restaurant when it opens. I am hoping that i will come to associate it with good times and good food.&nbsp;

				Look, social media is hard to master.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had a number of businesses join this board over the years, only to miscalibrate their message -- through over-enthusiastic spamming of the board, posting of deceptive reviews, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s best if we try to be patient and welcoming. <br /><br />I&#039;m not great at social media either, but the one thing I know for sure is that I would crash and burn trying to run a business.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve got a lot of respect for the people with the right people skills, work ethic, and risk-tolerance to tackle it. I have no expectation that those same people would also master social media, which requires a larger-than-healthy time investment in staring at screens.&nbsp; &nbsp;So in general, I think we should give the benefit of the doubt to any local businessfolk who try to open up a dialogue on this board, even if they don&#039;t do a great job of it at first.<br /><br />The proprietors of At Two Birds took a risk in sharing their vision for their new business and their frustrations navigating the local bureaucracy.&nbsp; They went a bit far in venting these frustrations, and have faced criticism for this (some constructive, some less so).&nbsp; The community has heard (and largely sympathized with) their complaints, and I expect they&#039;ve heard what the community has to say.<br /><br />Sometime soon, I hope this thread can return to its original purpose of sharing news and excitement about this upcoming &quot;Little Jackson Heights Restaurant.&quot;

				I was serious when I suggested PR help in this situation. What on earth is to be gained from getting into snarling fights on social media when preparing to open a new business? This is just insane, and someone needs to persuade the new business owners/investors of that fact and guide them in how best to interact with their potential new customer base. Seriously, they are planning to keep a list of customers to be banned from their establishment based on comments on this board? Why even say things like that and incite hostility? The people who live here and are interested enough in the neighborhood and its offerings to be reading this board are your customer base. <br /><br />As others have mentioned, some of the comments have been extremely condescending/arrogant/snobby, in a way that is very inappropriate for the spirit of this neighborhood and the people who choose to live here. You need to be politic and diplomatic and express support for other establishments in JH (rather than put-downs) while voicing your desire to offer the neighborhood something new and exciting. In other words, accentuate the positive, restrain yourself, and try not to make enemies. It&#039;s just common sense. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been very much excited about this new restaurant, but am kind of worried that it may crash and burn because of an inability to deal with the Community Board, the public, etc. in a rational, productive, positive way. These skills are extremely important to a successful business. (Have I just gotten myself banned? That would be a shame given that I live about a 2-minute walk away and am a devoted and frequent restaurant patron.)

				I also think there&#039;s a probability that these guys are getting screwed by the community board and that&#039;s terrifying if all your money is tied up in opening a business. Yet another drugstore is opening up on 37th near the wine store. We need another pharmacy like we need another 99-cent store, yet somehow they all manage to pay their rent. I don&#039;t see how they&#039;re doing that legally. Maybe I&#039;m being paranoid, but I wonder if someone will come around looking for a payoff from Stew? Yeah, he could probably handle it better, but I&#039;d be losing my shit too if I thought I was about to lose my shirt.

				I tend to agree with this line of thinking. I&#039;m not too sure if there is a separate thread for community board 3 but I have to say that I&#039;ve attended several meetings in the past and have found them to be quite off putting, insulting and ineffectual. I&#039;m sure that there are people who are honest and work hard but my interactions ( which had to do with illegal conversions and land marking) were quite negative. Yes, when you invest in a neighborhood and are doing something positive you want their support. They&#039;re suppose to work for us. I totally understand the frustration .

				FYI, that is not a new pharmacy opening near Table Wine. That&#039;s B&amp;B Pharmacy, which is currently on the next block (37th between 80th and 81st), moving due to high rents.

				Good news.<br /><br />Long meeting with the gentleman, also from the theater world, who is in charge of the lighting for the restaurant. His ideas are wonderful. <br /><br />Also, we&#039;re in discussions with a sculptor who may do some works that are integrated into the restaurant. She is extremely talented and has an international reputation. If this comes together, it is thrilling. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to point out, given a couple of recent posts, that I will be the chef/patron. There are a number of investors, one of whom has said things in the past to which two or three of you take exception. He is not in the restaurant business, he is entitled to his opinion, and he expressed the opinions in question before he became an investor. Indeed, his view that Jackson Heights can support an alternative - and I stress the word alternative - to what is currently available, is why he is backing up his opinion with actual cash that will help make this restaurant happen and create jobs in Jackson Heights.

				Here&#039;s the point. I&#039;ve been, for a long, long time, having and cultivating great relationships with local area restaurateurs and business owners around where I live. Yes, I know it&#039;s in their best interest to be kind and put on a good face for their business. But we&#039;re talking getting invited to private parties with the staff, buying gifts for their kids at times, basically a feeling that we&#039;re good friends, almost family in some cases. I&#039;m not naive, but it truly is a good feeling to feel like when you&#039;re patronizing a local place that they actually act like they care about the hood, and you and your family.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen the likes of this, ever. It&#039;s baffling, and frankly extremely telling. I don&#039;t even know how to make any sense of it. I&#039;ll try it, and see if the in-person experience is much better. If it isn&#039;t, it definitely won&#039;t be around for long in a place like JH. Sometimes things just come out wrong in writing and can be much better in person. But really. You need to stop. Do a reset. Fast.

				Hi queenskid2,<br /><br />Thanks for your support. We&#039;re having a lot of fun with this. <br /><br />One reason is that instead of going with a restaurant interior designer, we&#039;re working with theater designers. They know what they&#039;re doing, they&#039;re inventive, and they&#039;re fun to work with. <br /><br />Three days ago, we hired the woman who builds the sets for an iconic US TV show to build our banquette. Yes, we want custom rather than restaurant supply. We think that she&#039;s going to do a great job.<br />
