			Hi, <br /><br />I went on a closet-organizing spree a couple of months ago and ended up with a system that was more than I needed. As a result, I have the following things for sale. I bought them all at The Container Store. <br /><br />Over 100 beautiful wooden hangers, mint condition. They sell for $4 each but you can have them at the more neighborly price of $1 each. You don&#039;t have to take them all -- just let me know how many you&#039;d like. <br /><br />Hanging sweater shelf, made of wire<br /><br />Hanging sweater shelves, made of clear plastic<br /><br />Hanging shoe holder, made of clean off-white canvas. Holds six pairs. <br /><br />Please let me know if you&#039;re interested. Thanks.
