					I was doing some research about the Garden School and I came across this article in the New York Times. According to this story, Richard Marotta (the current Head Master at the Garden School) was involved with a school (Walden Lincoln) in the 1990s which sold its property to solve its financial problems. However, after two years the school was still losing money and was forced to close its doors. I&#039;m afraid that the Garden School will meet the same fate as Marotta&#039;s last school if it sells its field to a real estate developer.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF173DF93BA25751C0A967958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=richard%20marotta&amp;st=cse" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF173DF93BA25751C0A967958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=richard%20marotta&amp;st=cse</a><br /><br />Slump Not Exclusive, Private Schools Find<br />By ANDREW L. YARROW<br />Published: February 18, 1991<br /><br />One school recently confronted by these brutal realities has been Walden Lincoln. Three years ago, the Walden and New Lincoln Schools, both early-20th-century Progressive schools, merged after a decade of declining enrollments. New Lincoln&#039;s East 77th Street building was sold to the Birch Wathen School for about $7 million, said Richard Marotta, Walden Lincoln&#039;s director. In 1987, Walden sold property next to its school on Central Park West and 88th Street to a developer, Sutton East Associates, for $5 million, with another $2 million dependent on condominium sales by Sutton East.<br /><br />Despite this huge cash infusion, in December Walden Lincoln&#039;s board voted the school out of existence after a two-year, $3.6 million loss, and it was taken over by the Day School, an East Side elementary school.

					There was a very long line at my electoral district this morning, which is a good sign in a way.&nbsp; Many people came out to vote.&nbsp; I think, however, poll workers could have checked in folks a little faster, especially in the morning when people are on their way to work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was also a little frustrated with the second referendum question.&nbsp; I was okay with requiring less signatures for people to get on the ballot (more people would be able to run for office), but was not okay with giving the mayor more oversight in election processes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame all those points were bundled together.<br /><br />What did everyone else think?&nbsp; &nbsp;

					<strong>Hope everyone&#039;s filled out their census questionnaire and mailed it right back!</strong> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2010/03/23/news/top_stories/doc4ba91c1ddee58427053493.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2010/03/23/news/top_stories/doc4ba91c1ddee58427053493.txt</a><br /><br /><strong>Census coalition formed to get Queens counted</strong><br />BY CLAUDIA CRUZ<br />Tuesday, March 23, 2010 3:54 PM EDT<br />Thousands of households in the borough have received the 2010 Census form recently and community leaders want to ensure that all of Queens gets counted.<br /><br />For this reason, despite the norâ€™easter of Saturday, March 13, representatives of various groups announced the creation of the Census Coalition of Jackson Heights â€œto send the community the message to please participate in the 2010 Census,â€ according to Jessica Ramos, one of the organizers. The coalition will help residents complete their forms and answer any questions that they might have.<br /><br />Every ten years, the U.S. Constitution requires the government conduct a census of the population to decide Congressional apportionment and the administration of public federal funds â€“ funds that would be used for school, roads, hospitals, food stamps and assistance to small business, among other uses.<br /><br />â€œThe message is simple. We need everyone to register, that everyone completes the questionnaire,â€ said Adolfo SÃ¡nchez, president of the Colombian Civic Center. â€œWe need more resources for our neighborhoods. Please make sure you are counted.â€<br /><br />For the 2000 Census, only 55 percent of the residents of New York City returned their forms, compared to the 67 percent of national average. This yearâ€™s form has only 10 questions and takes under 10 minutes to complete.<br /><br />Gurpal Singh, the founder of SEVA, a nonprofit community that group serves the areaâ€™s Sikhs and others, explained that for each person that did not complete the forms, the neighborhood lost $30,000.<br /><br />A lot of people, in particular immigrants, refuse to complete the form. However, the Office of the Census reassures that the answers are secure and confidential, and that all employees were subjected to background checks and would be penalized if they violated this policy.<br /><br />â€œThere is no question of immigration status in the Census,â€ Singh said.<br /><br />The organizations that form part of the Jackson Heights Census Coalition include the Colombian Civic Center, New Immigrant Community Empowerment (N.I.C.E.), the Working Familyâ€™s Party North, Queens Community House, Jackson Heights Beautification Group, Queens Legal Club, SEVA and Chhaya.<br /><br />N.I.C.E. will offer help in with the Census forms on Saturday, March 27 from 11 a.m. at The Renaissance Charter School located at 35-59 81st Street near 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights. Assistance will be provided in Bengali, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Nepali, Spanish, and Urdu. For more information call and ask for Alejandra at 718-205-8796.

					We are currently looking to fill internship positions available within Daniel Dromm&#039;s City Council campaign this summer. Interning for the Dromm campaign in Queens&#039; 25th Council District (Jackson Heights, Rego Park, LeFrak City, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Woodside and Corona) will be an exciting and rewarding experience. Interns will have the opportunity to learn about the election process through firsthand participation in important day-to-day campaign operations to build a grassroots movement and bring change to Queens and New York City. The program is intended to provide knowledge, skills, and experience that each intern can apply to future challenges and professional endeavors.<br /><br /><br />Interns will participate in many facets of the campaign, including field, media, online and political operations. Activities may include direct voter contact, community outreach, volunteer recruitment, event planning and management, data management and general office duties.<br /><br /><br />Please forward this e-mail far and wide. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.danieldromm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.danieldromm.com</a> and contact Jessica Ramos at <a href="mailto:jessica@danieldromm.com" class="bbc_email">jessica@danieldromm.com</a> for an application.<br />
