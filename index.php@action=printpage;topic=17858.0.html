				&nbsp;Yes, it is on the east side, About halfway up the block on the other side of Roosevelt. There’s also a new Japanese ice cream roll/crêpe place going up there as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;The name of this restaurant is “Zaytoun,”&nbsp; which upon looking up is Palestinian for the word “Olive.“ So, yes, I think this will be a welcome and gap-filling culinary addition to the neighborhood.

				We&#039;ve been on a falafel kick- best right now are to buy either the balls or frozen mix at Trade Fare on 89th and make them ourselves.

Some kind of breading chopped and fried like they do to chicken. Next time I go by, I&#039;m going to ask him why he sold us that. <br /><br />Looking forward to Zaytoon. I was hoping it was the upscale deli style eatery in Lower Manhattan. Just checked and that&#039;s Zeytuna.

And the people working there were so friendly. It was one of those places where you walk in and already feel like family. I really wish the best for these guys.

				I stopped in yesterday, talked to the owner, who is a resident of JH, and tried a few menu items.&nbsp; The hummus was excellent as was the baba ghannush.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t try the falafel.<br />The owner said delivery will be available next week.&nbsp; They are still in the process of organizing themselves.&nbsp; The restaurant&#039;s layout is similar to the Brazilian restaurant on Roosevelt and 76 St.&nbsp; I think the reference to Colombia is that they also sell arepas.<br />The owner is an experienced restaurateur. I think they will do well, especially when Target moves in and more foot traffic will pass by.&nbsp; I will definitely go back.<br />The hours will be 11-11

				Looking forward to trying it out. But yeah, those menu and Facebook/Twitter photos are very misleading if they are essentially a bowl/sandwich/salad spot (Chipotle of [enter cuisine]). Like, at least remove the shakshouka photo, because that’s a stretch. Lol.

				I tried this place on Sunday. I&#039;m very glad to have it in the neighborhood; we don&#039;t have this kind of food really available anywhere else, so it&#039;s definitely filling a need. <br /><br />It is set up like a Chipotle of Middle Eastern food, but they also have a full menu (I think they do offer shakshuka for breakfast, though I&#039;m not certain). It&#039;s kind of choose-your-own adventure; you can do a plate or a pita, or just sort of pick and choose. I tried the babaghanoush, which was garlicky and delicious, and they heated the pita in the oven for me, which was great (nice fresh and fluffy pita). They threw in two falafel balls for free; I didn&#039;t love those, but I tend to only like falafel fresh out of the fryer, and these were premade.<br /><br />The place is clean and pleasant, and the people working there are really nice. I wish them lots of success and I&#039;m very glad they&#039;re here! Definitely worth stopping by.

				We stopped in today. The place was very clean. The staff and owner? were very welcoming. While I&nbsp; was going over the menu&nbsp; they offered us samples of the falafel. We ordered a side of falafel and a platter with rice, hummus, cucumber salad, cabbage. The falafel is very good. It was hot, fresh, crisp and not greasy!!! The prices were reasonable as well.&nbsp; I am very happy to have them nearby and wish them much success!

				My family tried Zaytoun tonight, and we were all very pleased.&nbsp; Everything was delicious.&nbsp; The beef shawarma was nicely seasoned, the baba ganoush was nicely smokey, and the sauces were very flavorful.&nbsp; The staff (when we visited, it was the owner&#039;s brother) was very eager to ensure that everyone was happy.&nbsp; And the prices are reasonable enough that we&#039;ll be able to afford to visit frequently.&nbsp; &nbsp;A great addition to the neighborhood!&nbsp; I just hope they&#039;re able to broaden the menu a bit over time with a bit more variety.

I passed by it Thursday evening around dinnertime and the gates were down, which struck me as odd. I was hoping that they might be on vacation or something. I did really like the place.

				It may be closed. I walked by on a Saturday evening. The gate was partly up and it was dark. People were talking inside. This place is/was really good. The owner commented to me once that business was difficult because the food is unique to the area and they do not serve alcohol.

				It was always empty when I went in there. Part of the problem was the lack of an ethnic base here to support them. The ones who did probably aren&#039;t regular visitors to that block. They had really good food so it&#039;s indeed a real shame! Middle Eastern food is so healthy and well-priced.
