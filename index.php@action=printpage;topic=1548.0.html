				All I really know about it is that it&#039;s also known as bordetella (http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=2&amp;articleid=452), and you can get your dog vaccinated against it. Every 6 months is recommended if you get your dog boarded. Camp Bow Wow requires the vaccination.

				spanishfish, I don&#039;t know much about kennel cough...only some stuff that I&#039;ve Googled about it.&nbsp; Since the cough is caused by an airborne virus, it&#039;s easily transmitted from one dog to another, a lot like how humans contract the common cold.&nbsp; So you may be right that you dog caught it while being boarded.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also read that most kennels will ask to see vaccination papers for dogs they board in order to prevent spreading illnesses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kennel cough may be viral, but when treated with meds, antibiotics may be prescribed in order to treat secondary bacterial infections in the dog&#039;s respiratory system.&nbsp; The good news is that kennel cough seems to respond very well to treatment.&nbsp; Some websites I&#039;ve read even state that depending on the severity, prescription meds may not be needed at all, just some careful monitoring.&nbsp; Of course your vet would be the best person to guide you as far as diagnosis or treatments go, and it would be best to take your dog in for a check-up as soon as possible.<br /><br />I don&#039;t use Ackerman for my dog, but I did for my first dog about 3 years ago.&nbsp; I remember going in around 8:30 a.m. to see the vets.&nbsp; Give them a call tomorrow early in the a.m. to find out their hours.&nbsp; (718) 639-5210.&nbsp; Hope your little guy/gal feels better real soon!&nbsp; :)
