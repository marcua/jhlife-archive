				So, you&#039;re probably aware that the Mayor is planning to decommission Riker&#039;s Island.<br /><br />But perhaps you don&#039;t know that Riker&#039;s Island, after being freed of prisoners... is being pinned for the expansion of LGA.<br /><br />That means new runways will be able to be built.<br /><br />And that leads to NOISE and NEW AIR TRAFFIC ROUTES. <br /><br />As they say, the price of freedom (and peace and quiet) is eternal vigilance!<br /><br />

				Agreed with abcdefghijk, and not so fast with the not happening: Before Rikers, people were held at facilities in each borough which, according to the de-commissioning plan, are to be refitted/rehabbed/rebuilt to reabsorb the population Rikers now has (or, rather, should not have). Since those jails are already on city property closer to the court complexes in the justice system, there&#039;s not much NIMBY-noisemaking could do to prevent potential expansion. Most aren&#039;t even close enough to exclusively residential areas to warrant an outcry. For LaGuardia, on the other hand ...&nbsp;

				since i&#039;ve already been tagged as &#039;obstreperous&#039;&nbsp; for disagreeing with our urban planner, i&#039;ll weigh in on this.<br /><br />Rikers opened 85 years ago - and NYC has changed a lot since then, both in terms of number of people incarcerated (for better or worse) and in terms of number of non-wealthy neighborhoods (shrinking yearly).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think they&#039;re likely to reopen the huge prison that once stood on Roosevelt Island, re-convert Jefferson Market Library at 6th and 10th in the village, or return a prison to the waterfront of Staten Island. the small facilities we have now would have to expand by leaps and bounds - and that&#039;s not likely in Downtown Brooklyn or the wildly gentrifying part of Lower Manhattan hear our courthouses.<br /><br />and, while this is off topic, i do think we&#039;d have a bit less noise. more planes using the facility, but that location would seem to push planes over the bronx, more than over us (i think).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16498.msg79025.html#msg79025">Quote from: voelteer on May 26, 2017, 02:38:32 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Agreed with abcdefghijk, and not so fast with the not happening: Before Rikers, people were held at facilities in each borough which, according to the de-commissioning plan, are to be refitted/rehabbed/rebuilt to reabsorb the population Rikers now has (or, rather, should not have).

				Well, again, this much is certain: The plan for eliminating Rikers involves refurbing existing facilities in addition to reducing numbers of the unnecessarily detained. No one is talking about knocking FDR from his new memorial perch on Roosevelt Island to build a new incarnation for incarceration there, for example. From our paper of record: &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-is-said-to-back-plan-to-close-jails-on-rikers-island.html?_r=0&gt; <br /><br />As for new flight paths and noise, only the oracle of the FAA could tell what an expansion of LGA onto Rikers might entail. At the same time, who would argue that remaining vigilant or being proactive hurts, unless they take some sort of pleasure in being &#039;obstreperous&#039;?<br /><br />

				if disagreeing with the guy who thinks it&#039;s logical to shut LGA and move it 100 miles upstate, eliminate all vehicular traffic from, well, pretty much everywhere, and exchange all private property for &quot;co-living spaces&quot;&nbsp; makes me obstreperous, so be it.<br /><br />then again, i&#039;m over 25, so i know nothing.
