				That&#039;s just terribly sad.&nbsp; Ms. Colombia was always a delightful presence in our neighborhood parades.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thread on Ms. Colombia from a few years ago (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=6086).&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if the links still work.

				Oh how sad! I know he had some health problems over the last few years. I used to love seeing him at all of the parades. Wonder what happened to his parrot. His poodle is probably no longer alive but those birds have long life spans.

				Truly sad news.&nbsp; Hadn&#039;t seen him in awhile.&nbsp; <br />He definitely added a lot of color and character to JH... and put a smile on your face for sure.<br />One of a kind!!

I have a photo I took of him in 2015 and he had a yorkie then (perhaps the poodle had passed; I know he had the poodle in 2013 because I have a photo him with it). So when I looked at my photos the first thing I thought was that I hoped the yorkie was okay!
