					Let me first say that a Community Board is at time the eyes and ears of many city agencies.<br /><br />Community Boards cannot enforce rules, but can offer conflict resolution by way of direct contact with city agencies.<br /><br />Yes, there are rampant traffic violations, proof that the NYPD @ 115th Precinct are doing their jobs.<br /><br />Solutions to preventing traffic issues are a smart idea, but with such dense population parking is at a premium causing double and triple parking conditions.<br /><br />Noise pollution must be targeted by the DEP, they have limited resources to provide enforcement of noise codes, if the noise is on-going, such as in a bar, daily or weekly parties in a persons house, a solution is possible, but random street noise is difficult.<br /><br />The out of control homelessness is really the same people who have been on our streets for at least the past ten years, they do not want to stay in shelters or hospitals, and they can not be forced to do so.&nbsp; If they get out of line, the NYPD does arrest them, or take them to Elmhurst Hospital.<br /><br />Signage regulations are addressed by the Department of Buildings, yes they do enforces signage rules, but again limited funding is available for enforcement, so it can take years to get businesses to comply with signage requirements.<br /><br />Building and zoning codes also fall under the short staffing of Department of Buildings, but illegal conversions are the most difficult to tackle.&nbsp; The other problem is that a person does not have to let the DOB gain access, and they cannot get a court order to barge in.&nbsp; This is why most building violations and illegal conversions have not been resolved.<br /><br /><br />I have lived in Jackson Heights for close to 30 years, and while it is not spotless and without problems, the neighborhood has come a long way in terms of crime reduction.&nbsp; Quality of life issues have increased due to vast over population, more people equals more garbage and more traffic.<br /><br /><br />If there is any complaint regarding problems in the neighborhood, call the Community Board office, and the courteous staff will definitely assist you.&nbsp;

					As a member of the Community Board, I resent the fact that we are being called useless by Francis.<br /><br />I can speak for myself, I am a tireless advocate for our community and walk the streets daily, and file complaints daily and they get resolved.<br /><br />Also the staff is very persistant with city agencies and get the job done.<br /><br />I TAKE IT TO HEART AND FEEL DISRESPECTED, THE COMMUNITY BOARD IS NOT USELESS<br /><br />I AM FEEL HONORED TO SERVE AND TAKE PRIDE IN MY SERVICE<br /><br />THIS IS THE PROBLEM, MANY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT CB3, AND MANY PEOPLE DO NOT THINK WE HAVE ANY POWER<br /><br />IF THERE IS A COMPLAINT MADE, ALL ARE LOOKED INTO, AND THE STAFF FILES 311 COMPLAINTS REGULARLY.

					Let me offer some clarity<br /><br />There are 11 stores within the Trade Fair chain, all owned by Farid Jabber, with corporate offices on 30th Avenue in Astoria.<br /><br />To my knowledge all 11 stores have a picket line<br /><br />I have visually seen picket lines at both Jackson Heights locations, 75th Street &amp; 89th Street at the same time<br /><br />Additionally on a trek out to Astoria, passed 2 locations with a picket line<br /><br />These picket lines seem to be formed by the workers from the current locations supplemented by union workers from other chains such as Stop &amp; Shop.<br /><br />Please note, Trade Fair has now replaced all of these workers, and at this point seems to have no intention of allowing their now former employees back onto the job.<br /><br />Trade Fair is a bad neighbor in almost every community they &quot;serve&quot;, simple violation searches clearly show their disregard for laws and community, such as illegal air conditioning units, illegal signage, illegal stoop line uses, illegal storage, blocked sidewalks, blocked exits, as well as agricultural and labor issues.<br /><br />The owner simply pays the fines as a cost of doing business, in the manner he wants to, but not the manner that complies with the law.

					The annual tree lighting has been a secret for many years now, with no advertising at all, and draws a much smaller crowd than in the past as a result.<br /><br />I have addressed this with the JHBG numerous times, and year after year the same thing occurs.<br /><br />The JHBG used to be a get your hands dirty, and clean up, and care about our community organization, it has become a mere mouthpiece over the past few administrations.<br /><br />I also dropped my membership to the JHBG many years ago because of this and many other issues.<br /><br />A community organization that does not invite the community to an event is not benefical to the community.<br /><br />I miss the days when the JHBG actually did something to benefit the community.<br /><br />Please note I have been living in Jackson Heights for almost my entire life, so I have seen it all.

					In terms of the couple on Northern Blvd., I have known Kevin for about 7 years, he is harmless and actually a very interesting guy to talk to, very well read as well, a fan of James Patterson, he is an alcoholic, and has been permanently disabled for a long time, having been an elevator operator.&nbsp; He is never dirty, rowdy, or anything along those lines. His girlfriend on the other hand is quite a rude character, I think he is with her for the company.&nbsp; They have an apartment somewhere around the fire house, I know he had a co-op in southridge years back before he fell on bad times. In terms them not being dealt with by the FDNY, Kevin is known by almost every NYPD officer, FDNY firefighter, MTA Bus Driver on the Q33 route, etc.&nbsp; He is no danger to anyone, but his girlfriend could go off the handle.<br /><br />In terms of the bearded man referred to in the original thread, he is dirty, drunk , and a total mess,&nbsp; from what I hear he is a military and NYPD veteran with quite a bit of money which he has squandered on alcohol.&nbsp; The smell under that scaffold is horrible from all of the urine.

					I have lived in Jackson Heights since 1985, I have seen it all, the ups and downs, and the times when we are all in harmony.&nbsp; The 80&#039;s were ok, the 90&#039;s were the days of high crime, and it was moderate as the new millenium began.<br /><br />Right now Jackson Heights is relatively at a midpoint, but far from dangerous, I never have reservations walking down the street, not even a dimly lit one.<br /><br />I have no problem telling the truth, so those who think it is dangerous here, let me enlighten you on the 90&#039;s:<br /><br />1) Murders were at an all time high<br /><br />2) The drug trade was flourishing<br /><br />3) Prostitution on most of Roosevelt Avenue<br /><br />4) Child molestors unphased, they stood right outside schools, even when their wanted posters were all over.<br /><br />5) Burglary was at an all time high (my apartment was burglarized at least 3x during most years in the 1990&#039;s)<br /><br /><br />Why do I mention all of this negativity?&nbsp; The key reason is that these activities are almost non-existant these days in JH.<br /><br /><br />No plans on leaving, Jackson Heights is the place to be, as for those who do not agree, why are you still here? (not to be too harsh)<br /><br />

					Someone mentioned earlier about how did they get a variance.<br /><br />No variance is needed, only certain standards that must be met to conform with landmarks standards.<br /><br />All of 37th Avenue can have mixed use as-of-right buildings of approx 8 stories high.<br /><br />This is the zoning, petition for a study and have it rezoned, I wish that would happen too.<br /><br />35-64 85th Street the building on the next lot has applied to build a similar building, the problem is no one is sure the existing structure can be demolished.<br /><br />Keep your eyes peeled, sewers will soon be overflowing as the cannot support additional residential units.<br />

					I can say I have had a good experience 99.9% of the time, things happen sometimes, this is reality, even though perfection would be nice.<br /><br />I am at Jax Inn at least once a week, and love it, and it is always packed on the weekends, and for lunch and dinner.<br /><br />The certainly do not close at 11, I have been there at various times of the morning, as have many of my collegues, 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am, they are really open 24 hours, no doubt about it.<br /><br />The get heavy post-club traffic, after the clubs close at 4am.
