					Not stadiums per se, there were two popular fields that were used by business-sponsored teams on Sunday afternoons. One was located the north-side at Northern Blvd between 88th Street and 89th Street (&quot;Dukes Field&quot;), the other on the south-side of Northern between 92nd and 93rd Street. I seem to recall that a team called &quot;Tom Travers&quot; played there on Sundays&#039; as well. At &quot;Dukes Field,&quot; the right fielder was positioned on 89th Street when a left-handed batter was at the plate - and had to call &quot;time-out&quot; when a Triboro Coach Q-19B bus came by. This was in the time period after WWII until the early fifties. I am not sure how long those lots were vacant and still utilized for Sunday afternoon baseball games.

					I graduated from SJA in 1950 and lived at 32-26 84th Street. When I was born (1936), we lived at 32-06 82nd Street for a short time. Dr. Lobell had his office on the SW corner of 82nd and 32nd Avenue. The principal at SJA was Sister Donalda. I attended SJA from 4th grade thru 8th. Sr. Mary Martin, Sr. Edith, Mrs. Monahan, Mrs. Quinlan, Sr. Patricia and Sr. Sylvia. I was never in Sr. St. Catherine&#039;s class but do recall and agree with what has been said about her; she was what I would imagine an angel would look like. The art teacher that was referred to was Miss Parker. There was another red-headed teacher in SJA by the name of Mrs. Powell. There was a Franciscan Monk who would visit SJA occasionally who would sing for us - as well as teach a music lesson - Father Rudolf. As I recall, Fr. Boylan was the Pastor and he was assisted by Fr. Lenihan (who became the Pastor of Our Lady of Fatima when that Parish was formed right after the war), Fr. Cunningham, Fr. Mooney and Fr. McCarthy. From 1964 until 1968 I was a driver on the Triboro Q-33 bus between B&#039;way and 74th and LaGuardia Airport. Renewed some old friendships during that time. <br />I&#039;m really enjoying the memories that are being shared on this forum.&nbsp;

					During WWII, the candy store between 83rd &amp; 84th St. on Northern Blvd. (north-side) was owned by a couple named Weber. He always had a cigar in his mouth. They were not related to Jacob Weber who operated the drug store on the NW corner of Northern Blvd and 84th St. The candy store on the south-side of the Blvd (also between 83rd &amp; 84th St.) was owned by a couple whose name was Furst. After his health failed, their niece Gloria Rubin and her husband Harry moved down from Hartford CT. and ran the store. He was a WWII veteran who participated in the D-Day invasion at Normandy. Harry was a most friendly and congenial man. He drew many new customers to this formerly slow business.&nbsp; &nbsp;
