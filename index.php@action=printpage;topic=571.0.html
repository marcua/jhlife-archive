				Dosa Diner is being replaced by, drum roll, Dosa Place. The new awning went up today.<br /><br />And, right next door, Mehmaan Tandoori &amp; Sweets is being replaced by, I think it was, Ratchit Tandoori &amp; Sweets. <br /><br />So what&#039;s old is new, I guess.

				Thanks for posting the news!<br /><br />Dosa Diner had a loyal word-of-mouth following from people outside the neighborhood.&nbsp; I saw a number of posts on other boards mourning its passing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully Dosa Place will be as good.<br /><br />As for Mehmaan, I preferred its predecessor, Dimple.&nbsp; Hopefully the new place will be cleaner and more welcoming.

Hopefully Dosa Place will be a bit less, um, odd, I guess.<br /><br />And Mehmaan just never seemed right. I bought food there once but, when I got it home, it all just looked kind of shriveled and a bit off so I tossed it. Hopefully the next go-around will be a bit more appetizing.

				We ate at Dosa Diner once and we LOVED the food. But the atmosphere of the restaurant was really bad (bright lighting, generic tables and seating), so hopefully this will be a big improvment. I&#039;m looking forward to going back when they reopen.

				I&#039;ve always heard DOSA was good, but never got a chance to go.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever Mehmaan Tandoori &amp; Sweets/Ratchit Tandoori was right after Dimple (which had rockin&#039; dosas) closed was just disgusting, inedible slop.&nbsp; That space kind of seems to be a black hole as it&#039;s changed over now 4 times in the 3 years I&#039;ve lived down the block so hopefully it&#039;ll be something better than it&#039;s been.&nbsp; At least the halal guy is back in front of Duane Readed again - and his stuff is always consistent.

				Dosa Place seems to be open quite late with loud music. I wondered if there were more of a nightclub atmosphere within than a restaurant, at least at night. (I havenâ€™t gone in partly because loud music tends to annoy me, partly because the dosa is a high-carbohydrate food.) Well, thanks to TenzinTsewang from New Mexico, we have video of what seems to be a (mild) performance of some kind. See http://www.twitter.com/tenzintsewang/statuses/908837052 (http://www.twitter.com/tenzintsewang/statuses/908837052) and its accompanying video link.

				dosa is like a hard crepe with indian food in it.<br />google it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa<br /><br />when I&#039;ve gone past late at night, many times there is music playing and people are having a ball.

				I think the latest incarnation of Dosa Diner is as good as the previous ones.&nbsp; I have to restrain myself from getting take-out from there too often, but it&#039;s very inexpensive and delicious.&nbsp; For about $6, you can get a dosa that comes with some sauces--plenty to fill me up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found the service to be friendly and fast.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been in once when there was a peformance, but on weekdays, it&#039;s pretty quiet.&nbsp; Nothing weird about it--just yummy dosas!&nbsp; I recently took a friend from out of town here, and he thought it was some of the best food he had in NYC.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				We both were in the mood for a dosa.&nbsp; I check Yelp, and saw they had a terrific rating, with a lot of very recent positive reviews..&nbsp; We visited Dosa Delight on 73rd street for lunch.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Amazingly delicious.&nbsp; Also every table was occupied.&nbsp; This place will have to back on heavy rotation.&nbsp; We both ate delicious Dosa’s, but the table nearby had the Thali and that looked amazing.&nbsp; <br />The service was really great, and we were full the rest of the day!&nbsp;

				So we revisited Dosa Delight and this time tried the thali.&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; the food here in the past was very good, but the recent visits prove the food is now exceptional.&nbsp; <br />The thali was a terrific opportunity to try a lot of different things at one time.&nbsp; Also the bread provided was delicious.&nbsp; <br />One of the best things here is you can also have an authentic Indian Beer with your meal.. the two waiters did a great job in taking care of every occupied tables during lunch!
