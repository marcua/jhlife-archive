				<em>Yes, Louis Ruggiero (718- 898-4900) is right on 90Th st and 35Th Ave (He&#039;s sort of a local celeb).&nbsp; I worked and recommended him quite&nbsp; a few times.&nbsp; As a good option I recommend Adam Sutton, he is a 1st time buyers specialist and he knows all the available grants going on at the Banks.&nbsp; Call him at 917-459-9976 and tell him that you are a 1st time buyer and he will get the ball rolling for you.&nbsp; There is an $8,000 grant out there and also a 2% grant out there.&nbsp; Good Luck.</em><br /><br /><strong>PS...drop my name Luis Martinez...LOL ;)</strong>

				..hey there folks, my wife and i are at the stage where we were given the financials of a co op that we are thinking of purchasing. the first lawyer we&#039;ve given it to seems to be hard to reach and we would like to get the ball rolling. so, we were wondering if anybody knew one they would recommend and be able to give us a quick but thorough assessment of the financial health of the co op. if they specialize and know the area of jackson heights/ elmhurst..even better. thanks!<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>(moderator note: just merged this new thread with one from a few days ago called &quot;real estate lawyer&quot;)</em>

				We used Ruggiero and did not have a pleasant experience. Not very attentive and did not explain all of our rights to us. Was also very argumentative.

				I have to say that I chose Louis Ruggiero and even though I just pulled out of my deal&nbsp; :( after he reviewed the contract for me, he graciously did not charge me. I will definitely use him in 2-3 months when i WILL be buying an apt. in JH (hopefully the same one I just had to decline).

				I was looking for a place to buy a couple of months ago and wanted to get some background on my closing costs.&nbsp; I did a Google search and the best website I found also happens to be a blog run by a local attorney that someone else had mentioned, Sunil Agarwal.&nbsp; The link is<br /><br />http://skalaw.blogspot.com/&nbsp; <br /><br />Very interesting reading and something that I have referred back to several times.&nbsp; When I did find a couple of places, this guy&#039;s name kept coming up again.&nbsp; The agent I was using gave me a list of preferred attorneys and his name was on it.&nbsp; When I asked him about Mr. Agarwal, he said that he was &quot;great and wonderful to work with.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t take the place so I didn&#039;t use him.&nbsp; Then I found another place and that agent also told me to use him.&nbsp; So I did and I was very satisfied.&nbsp; He is friendly and returns phone calls and emails and knows what he is doing.&nbsp; I am very happy.<br /><br />Ira

				The office of nicholas pelligrino was the worst. The staff was so rude and unprofessional. We should have known from day one when the receptionist laughed at us and said &quot;I don&#039;t care its my last day here&quot; Sloppy dressed assistant, unanswered phone calls, sloppy contracts do I need to go on?
