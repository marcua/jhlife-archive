				I was wondering how to do this exact thing.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotta get the 38 layers of paint off my radiatiors along with a gross looking pipe in my bathroom.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I&#039;ve read up a lot on this subject and I don&#039;t think there are any real easy ways to do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s gonna take a lot of chemicals, scraping, and sanding.&nbsp; Here is a link I found to be helpful.&nbsp; Let me know how yours goes!&nbsp; http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infpai/infstripmetal.html<br />

				oh, i had no intention of doing it myself. i have seen some short videos of professionals sandblasting them. but this requires removal and transport to sandblasting location. i am looking for a local professional. i heard of someone down in the dc area who charges $10-$30 a fin (depending on ornamentation). if i find any more information, i&#039;ll post it here.

				We stripped all the radiators in our place about 3 yrs ago. We used a company called Stripquick (easily found on 411 or google).&nbsp; They are based in Staten Island, and they showed up, pulled out the radiators, stripped them, and then re-installed them about a week later.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t cheap, but their work was good, and the radiators are far more efficient without the 10+ layers of flaking lead paint.<br /><br />We have had lots of other stripping done in our place with great results, but to get this done the radiators have to come out.&nbsp; There&#039;s no other way to get to the nooks and crannys.

I am interested in stripping my old radiators and would like to know if there are any recommendations or better yet, where do I start?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a messy, dirty, and horribly labor intensive job.&nbsp; Are you currently living in the place, or are you renovating a currently vacant apartment ??&nbsp; &nbsp;also, is the heat on in them ??<br /><br />If your radiators currently have heat coming through them (i.e., if they are hot), I wouldn&#039;t even consider doing this until the spring, because extra heat will drive the chemicals into the air, and into your lungs and anyone else nearby.&nbsp; I recently stripped all my radiator covers and windowframes, (not the radiators themselves, thank God), and also the steam return pipes in the bathrooms, and spray painted all of them (came out beautifully, but the job took weeks).&nbsp; I used a product called Peel-Away, which takes a long time, but is much less toxic than products with methylene chloride (which I also used, and it&#039;s much quicker than the PeelAway).&nbsp; Both of these are available in the paint section at Home Depot, BTW.<br /><br />How they worked: <br /><br />PeelAway is a product that you spread on, then cover with some special paper that&#039;s included.&nbsp; You need to trim the paper to the job.&nbsp; You brush on the peelAway (GENEROUSLY), then cover it with the paper.&nbsp; You then WAIT ABOUT 2-4 DAYS, then pull/scrape the paper off.&nbsp; Most of the paint will come off with it.&nbsp; The longer you wait, the deeper the penetration into the old paint.&nbsp; You may have to follow up to get the residual bits, or deeper layers.&nbsp; Once you get most of the initial paint off, you can hit it again with PeelAway, just put it on and wait a few minutes, then get it off with a scraper or steel wool.&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to wear gloves and you should wear a mask, but it&#039;s not too bad.&nbsp; Anything that&#039;s left, you need to get after with a methylene chloride based stripper.&nbsp; You can get it in a spray can.&nbsp; It is nasty, vile stuff, but it will clean up anything that&#039;s left.&nbsp; Get a good RESPIRATOR or filter type mask - spend the $25 that it&#039;s going to cost for this piece of equipment.&nbsp; Methylene Chloride is not good to breath, you will get dizzy, light headed, and a little headachy. (see here: http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/423.html).&nbsp; But it will get the last bits off.&nbsp; ALWAYS wear thick gloves, esp with Methylene chloride strippers.&nbsp; And not just the thick $5 rubber gloves for heavy duty cleaning.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking the really thick rubber ones that come up halfway on your elbows.&nbsp; Wear clothes you intend to throw away after the job, too.&nbsp; AND W@EAR A SERIOUS AIR FILTRATION MASK, not just a dust mask.&nbsp; Open ALL of the windows.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t take the time to use the peelaway, use the methylene chloride stripper, but (again), all of the above cautionary notes apply.&nbsp; It will do the job, but it&#039;s nasty, vile stuff.<br /><br />After you strip it, I suppose you will want to paint it.&nbsp; MAKE SURE TO USE PAINT THAT TOLERATES HIGH HEAT.&nbsp; This goes for the steam return lines that everyone has in their bathrooms as well (usually a pipe that&#039;s hot in the winter and located in a corner of the bathroom somewhere).&nbsp; Rustoleum makes a good high heat paint, it&#039;s available in 4 colors at Home Depot in spray paint cans.&nbsp; Again, there&#039;s lots of problems using spray paint in your home, cover everything in the entire room, then seal the bottom of the doors with tape while you&#039;re painting (it will get under the door and onto the floor just outside the door if you don&#039;t).&nbsp; The high heat spray paint does seem to not fly as far as regular spray paint (which I repainted all my windowframes with).&nbsp; Wear a respirator with this too.<br /><br />Hope this advice helps you.&nbsp; Good luck with the job.&nbsp; <br /><br />TheMariner<br />

				i got a quote of about $75/hr for sandblasting with evernu and he estimated about 2 1/2 hours for a standard radiator. He also said powder coating was another $200. do i need the powder coat? i actually like the look of clean metal but was wondering if radiators needed a coat of something.

				well, i decided to do the work myself. didn&#039;t use any chemicals, just chipped away at the old paint with a screwdriver, hammer, a wire brush and sandpaper. i didn&#039;t get to remove all the layers but i got a lot off and smoothed it for a good old primer and painted with silver enamel paint. here is the final project completed.

That doesn&#039;t make your landlord an evil villain it was simply a product (no pun intended) of the times.&nbsp; <br /><br />My advise to anyone with concerns is go to the EPA web site,&nbsp; They will give you the &quot;scare tactics&quot; but it is good education.&nbsp; If you have children or even pets at home then please, make sure you don&#039;t have any chipping paint of surfaces like doors or windows rubbing.&nbsp; If you have children do take the most cautious approach to paint management.&nbsp; One of the reason children seem attracted to the lead based chips is supposed to be because the paint somehow tasted semi sweet (Never tried it myself).&nbsp; If you are in an adult only home...I&#039;m sure you wont reach out and eat the paint chips on the floors (beside Chuckie, liam and Rose)&nbsp; but everyone else probably won&#039;t.<br /><br />On a last note...lead dust is not like asbestos dust.&nbsp; Asbestos dust is very aerodynamic and it can float 48 to 72 hrs from a single air flow episode.&nbsp; Lead in dust is relatively heavy and would not become airborne for long (at least not long unless continuously agitated) using a respirator is always a good idea but using wet methods are your best wet to avoid exposure</strong>

				I&#039;d love to see the &quot;To Be Continued...&quot; to that tutorial post! I have used peel away on my 50s metal door buzzer/intercom a couple years ago and on the old metal hamper in the bathroom, it worked great!<br /><br />But on my to-do list for the past 4 years are the radiators, which look exactly like the ones in this post! Flat panels just like that. For my hamper, I ended up having to paint over it with a nice black satin rustoleum paint, the buzzer I left untreated as stainless steel.

				That radiator does look remarkable considering that it was done by hand. I would think the less labor intensive way to clean an old radiator would be to take it out and have a company sandblast it. I&#039;d then also have them paint it with a paint that won&#039;t discolor or flake because of the heat.
