				I was born in Jackson Heights in 1949. Went to PS 69 and PS 145. Lived on 75th Street between 35th and 37th Avenue. Left Jackson Heights in 1964.

				I&#039;m 8 years younger than you, but my father owned and ran Toy City until he sold it and went back to school to become a clinical psychologist in 1968.&nbsp; I remember hanging out in the store and the always-present smell of smoked fish from Wexler&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t have nearly the memory of all the stores that you have, but I certainly remember Jay Dee, Carvel, Bohack and Shop Wise, Jahn&#039;s (still there) and Field&#039;s Dept Store (my mother always took me there to shop for clothes).&nbsp; I particularly remember the roof behind Toy City which can be seen from 76th Street as it comes down to about 4 feet above ground level and rises sharply towards 75th Street.&nbsp; My brother (2.5 years older) and I would play ball (and we had the choice of just about any kind of ball--Spaldines were the primary plaything) back there as if we were the only people on earth.&nbsp; Great topic--hope you get more comments.

				I remember Wexler&#039;s and Toy City and most of the rest.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t there a Kosher deli between 75th and 76th, on the south side of 37th.&nbsp; Also, the drug store opposite Royal was called Almadine or something like that.

				Wow!&nbsp; Nice list!&nbsp; I remember some of the businesses you mention, but in 1980s Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Here are a few:<br /><br />Fern&#039;s Stationery<br />Lamston&#039;s<br />Merit Farms -- Interesting tidbit... new business owners continued using the Merit Farms name for a few years before it changed.<br />Jay Dee Bakery<br />Carvel<br />Bruson Building -- There was a fire at the Bruson back in 2014.&nbsp; It&#039;s only recently that new business have leased ground level space.<br />Toy City<br />The two Key Foods<br />Jahn&#039;s <br />Field&#039;s<br />The Colony<br />Woolworth<br />The Florsheim<br />Clark&#039;s<br /><br />For anyone living in Jackson Heights in the 80&#039;s, do you remember Numbers Records &amp; Tapes? I spent a lot of time hanging out in there.&nbsp; There was also a small used book store on 37th (between 76th &amp; 77th) near what is now Due Fratelli, I think.&nbsp; Memories!&nbsp; <br />
