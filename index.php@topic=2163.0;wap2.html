I had my 6th grade party there in 1980 ... its the building that now is/was some Asian importer, around 71st, next to the gully where those train tracks are.&nbsp; Has a deeply recessed entrance ...<br /><br />I was 10 then 11 (after the party), waiting on club-like lines to get in and hobble the loop and hug the wall. :)

			Age is showing here&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Back then I used to bring groups of high schoolers over from East Harlem for a fun night out.&nbsp; They were amazed that someone my age could skate!&nbsp; Hmmph!!&nbsp; Of course age is really revenge in slow motion, so now their kids are amazed at what they can still do at their age!!&nbsp; So old. So young. So relative.&nbsp; :coolsmiley:
