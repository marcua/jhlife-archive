				I am a regular user of this station both the subway and the 7 line.This is the hub station for Jackson Heights yet it seems to be festering in neglect. The subway lines are always foul and dirty, a perfect environment for the ever larger rats that have made this station their special preserve. The walls are dirty, the stairs leading out of the station on 37th road are nearly always covered in litter. Recently the elevator to the 7 train has been stopping on the platform with the doors not opening for 30 seconds enough time for anyone with the slightest bit of anxiety to start wondering how long a response might take after pressing the alarm button.<br /><br />Does the community have any access to the station manager on a regular basis? Only regular and frequent accountability to users of the service can there be any hope of turning around this disgraceful situation.

				&nbsp;I like that someone is bringing up this concern. As a transportation hub in Queens, we should be a <br />showcase for the MTA.

				parts of our station, particularly those around 73rd, are extremely nasty. and i do think it has a lot to do with the privatization deals the MTA has cut to save money. that&#039;s why escalators go out of service for months, even years at a time (see Union Square). they issue fines against the property owners, who pay them and continue to ignore repair orders, since it&#039;s much cheaper to pay the fines.<br /><br />it&#039;s really all about cash. if there&#039;s money to be spent, it&#039;s going to go to track work and train repair before it&#039;s going to go into station cleaning. and since this is a zero sum game, i&#039;d prioritize train service over stairwell cleaning as well. it&#039;d be nice to be able to say &#039;well, we deserve both,&#039; but realistically there is a finite amount of cash there, and it&#039;s not terribly well managed -- much like road repair, police efforts, public housing and so on.<br /><br />and for what it&#039;s worth, i see power washers with bleach working on the mezzanine and inner stairwells pretty often -- right around one AM, usually.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11474.msg55952.html#msg55952">Quote from: Di_11372 on March 29, 2014, 10:20:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Take a tour around every borough, and you will see that our station is on the same level of dirt &amp; neglect as most stations.&nbsp; For me, this is a much bigger MTA topic, why can&#039;t we have a cleaner subways as a whole, regardless of the specific station.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				For one thing, we can get rid of the guy who distributes handouts to the transients on the corner of 72nd and Roosevelt every night. It&#039;s a public health concern when every other night there&#039;s 20-30 transients eating food on the ground and leaving the trash for us residents to walk through. Bird shit everywhere and puddles of urine right next to the momo cart. <br /><br />Not to the concern of crime from having so many people there hanging out all the time with nothing to do. Poor Filipino guy just got punched in the face the other day and died.<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-dies-punched-face-stranger-queens-article-1.1843230<br /><br />Get rid of the AM New York stand on the corner of Broadway and 72nd because it just gets strewn about everytime it rains or someone decides they want to throw the newspapers. <br /><br />And how about the furniture movers that leave their filing cabinets and office chairs on the corner of Roosevelt and 72nd once or twice a week? Since when is that a staging area for movers? Get them out.<br /><br />You&#039;d think Daniel Dromm would treat this as a priority issue, but he&#039;s too busy with his own &quot;agenda&quot; to care about basic quality-of-life issues. Yeah I&#039;ve written to him before, and they just play the blame game, saying it&#039;s the MTA not the city. If it&#039;s an issue they actually cared about, they&#039;d figure out a way to get it done.

				There is a large sign about construction outside the station on Broadway, right near where several of the buses turn right out of the terminal to head towards 35th Ave or Roosevelt.&nbsp; It says something about two escalators being replaced and that it&#039;s projected to last into 2015 and that the budget is $11 million.

				Yes, I think you&#039;re right.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 74th St. escalators are walled off for replacement.&nbsp; They set up the barriers to try to improve &quot;traffic&quot; flow in the station.&nbsp; &nbsp;During rush hour today, things weren&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully they&#039;ll stay this way for the rest of the summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Expect the real craziness to start after Labor Day, when commuters have returned from their summer vacations and school is back in session.<br /><br />I think the 73rd Street escalators are still in service, so anybody needing to transfer between the 7 and the E/F/M/R should use the westernmost end of the platform.

				It does look awful the way it is set up. But getting through there when there are large crowds has been rediculous. People seem to disregard, or abandaned, or just don&#039;t care about the old standard of stay to the right. Those stairs had been a free for all. <br /><br />It aught to be simple. There are 3 sections. Stay to the right. That should mean one section up, one section down, and the middle is wide enough to have one person at a time doing both. Of course the middle section can be all one way or the other according to traffic. But NO people don&#039;t seem to get it. <br /><br />Add on top of the confusion That there is always someone who wants to take the wholestair to carry a baby stroller or the people who stop at the top or bottom, or middle, to check cell phones. Is it really that important to see what&#039;s on your cell right then and there? Move to the right side or simply wait till you are out of the way.<br /><br />Can we call what they are doing a lesson in manners?

				I filed an complaint about this on MTA&#039;s site. They&#039;ve removed the yellow tape that they used to cordon off some areas but this continues to be absolutely inane.

				Agreed. But there&#039;s something to be said for a sharp elbow or knee to someone insisting on pushing thru a crowd in the wrong direction

				Could have sworn either Metro or AMNY came out with stats a few months back, and Roosevelt Ave was the busiest station outside of Manhattan. I can&#039;t find the article online though. <br /><br />I find it hard to believe that Main Street (1 line) is bigger than Roosevelt Ave (5 lines).

				Ridership stats from MTA:<br /><br />http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/<br /><br />Daily Ridership: JH is the 16th busiest station in the city, Flushing is 13th. Weekday ridership at JH was up about 1.5% btw 2012-13, much less than the increases in Astoria and LIC (around 10%), and even less than Forest Hills (4.5%).<br />http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub.htm. <br /><br />On weekends, JH is 10th and Flushing is 12th<br />http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub_weekend.htm<br /><br />JH is 14th overall in the city, and 2nd in Queens, in ridership (again behind Flushing), but again, the increase from 2012-13 is less than in other areas of Queens. (it&#039;s about 3%) The higher rate of increase at JH on the weekends likely has to do with the fact that the 7 train is usually out of service on the weekend.<br />http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_sub_annual.htm<br /><br />So while it may be true that the station itself is busier, it doesn&#039;t appear to be that all of the increased traffic is due to trips originating in JH, especially when you consider the change in weekday ridership. The crowding may be due to decreased frequency of trains or more people transferring at JH. If you really want to talk about where things are changing in Queens you&#039;d be better to look in Astoria and LIC where ridership jumped more than 10% btw 2012-13.

				QnsRunr,<br /><br />If you look at a Queens bus map, you can see why the Flushing station is so high.&nbsp; In addition to being a dense urban center, an amazing number of bus lines from all over eastern Queens converge there and people pour into the station.&nbsp; We have a few bus lines like that in Jackson Heights, but not nearly as much.&nbsp; But we do have extremely high transfer volumes between the #7 train and the underground lines that aren&#039;t captured in MTA&#039;s turnstile statistics.&nbsp; &nbsp;No matter how your slice it, both stations are very busy and crowded!

				Turnstile numbers don&#039;t really indicate at all how crowded or the absolute number of people in a station at a given time. I can understand how Main St has more people who swipe their card than Roosevelt Ave, but I really doubt that Main St has anywhere near the amount of foot traffic that Roosevelt Ave does. <br />Roosevelt Ave is a major west-bound transfer point for at least 5 other stations. <br /><br /><br />I recall at some points during the year, there are MTA workers with clipboards that appear to count how many people actually get on and off the train, which would be a much more relevant statistic. <br /><br />On a slightly related note, anyone remember the site outside the station after Hurricane Sandy when they re-opened the subways? More people on the street than the Nepalese festival.
