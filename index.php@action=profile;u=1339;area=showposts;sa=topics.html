					In the relatively near future, I&#039;d like to redo my bathroom, which has a separate bathtub and shower stall. I&#039;d like to maintain as much of the prewar charm as possible but still modernize it. The shower stall&#039;s ceiling is about 16 inches lower than the rest of the bathroom. I won&#039;t know for sure until I talk to the super, but from anyone else&#039;s experience: is it possible to raise the shower ceiling a bit? I&#039;d love to get a nicer shower system in there but it probably wouldn&#039;t work with a low ceiling. I&#039;d also like to install a glass door instead of a curtain, which tends to make it dark in there.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested in people&#039;s before/after pics if they&#039;re willing to share. <br /><br />Thanks!

					I thought this article might be of interest to the readers of this forum, especially since Jackson Heights no doubt has its share of undocumented immigrants.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090202673.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090202673.html</a><br /><br /><strong>How illegal immigrants are helping Social Security</strong><br /><br /><em>By Edward Schumacher-Matos<br />Friday, September 3, 2010;</em><br /><br />The contributions by unauthorized immigrants to Social Security -- essentially, to the retirement income of everyday Americans -- are much larger than previously known, raising questions about the efforts in many states and among Republicans in Congress to force these workers out.<br /><br />In response to a research inquiry for a book I am writing on the economics of immigration, Stephen C. Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration and someone who enjoys bipartisan support for his straightforwardness, said that by 2007, the Social Security trust fund had received a net benefit of somewhere between $120 billion and $240 billion from unauthorized immigrants.<br /><br />That represented an astounding 5.4 percent to 10.7 percent of the trust fund&#039;s total assets of $2.24 trillion that year. The cumulative contribution is surely higher now. Unauthorized immigrants paid a net contribution of $12 billion in 2007 alone, Goss said.<br /><br />Previous estimates circulating publicly and in Congress had placed the annual contributions at roughly half of Goss&#039;s 2007 figure and listed the cumulative benefit on the order of $50 billion.<br /><br />The Social Security trust fund faces a solvency crisis that would be even more pressing were it not for these payments.<br /><br />&quot;If for example we had not had other-than-legal immigrants in the country over the past,&quot; Goss e-mailed me, &quot;then these numbers suggest that we would have entered persistent shortfall of tax revenue to cover [payouts] starting [in] 2009, or six years earlier than estimated under the 2010 Trustees Report.&quot;<br /><br />Americans are faced with the difficult choice of cutting pensions, delaying the retirement age or raising taxes if we want to maintain the solvency of what has been the centerpiece of social welfare for ordinary Americans since the 1930s.<br /><br />Legal immigrants are also net contributors to the pensions of the rest of us because they are relatively young as a group. But the benefit we receive from unauthorized immigrants carries special irony. Immigration restrictionists in Arizona, Virginia, Texas and almost every state in the country are pushing bills and local ordinances to force them out by making it difficult to get jobs, rent apartments, send their children to college or drive cars.<br /><br />The Pew Hispanic Center estimated this week that the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country dropped from a peak of 12 million in March 2007 to 11.1 million in March 2009. The drop is due in part to the recession but also to the hostile atmosphere toward unauthorized immigrants.<br /><br />The Obama administration isn&#039;t helping much. Barack Obama, like George W. Bush before him, favors legalizing most of the unauthorized. But in making enforcement systems tighter to curtail future illegal immigration, his administration is deporting ever more of the ones already here -- to the tune of 400,000 this year. Yet the administration has resisted pressuring congressional Democrats to craft a legalization bill, in part because of Republican opposition.<br /><br />Adding to the Social Security irony is that the restrictionists are mostly older or retired whites from longtime American families. The very people, in other words, who benefit most from the Social Security payments by unauthorized immigrants.<br /><br />The Social Security actuaries estimate that two-thirds of unauthorized immigrant workers, or 5.6 million people, were paying into the system in 2007. Roughly half used a Social Security number tied to an invented name or one that belonged to someone else. Of the rest, many got legal cards when they entered the country under a temporary work visa. They stayed illegally after their visas expired.<br /><br />About 180,000 unauthorized immigrants received about $1 billion in fraudulent benefits in 2007, Goss said. These benefits are subtracted from the net contribution. Few of the unauthorized workers are likely to receive anything, ever. About the only way they might would be if they were to become legal, and they had paid their withholding taxes using their true names.<br /><br />The decline in illegal immigration, plus tighter workplace enforcement, means that contributions from the unauthorized will decrease. But as Goss notes, they remain, because of larger families, a positive contributing factor to Social Security solvency.<br /><br />Somebody ought to say thank you.<br /><br /><em>Edward Schumacher-Matos is syndicated by the Washington Post Writers Group.

					I&#039;m thinking about getting an elliptical machine. Are these as apartment friendly as I hope they are? I don&#039;t want to annoy my downstairs neighbor, and I&#039;m hoping the low-impact of an elliptical won&#039;t be a nuisance. Anyone have any experience with one in a pre-war building?

					A very random question:<br /><br />I&#039;m getting married this coming fall and we still have yet to find a DJ. We&#039;d both probably prefer a band, but we are a bit strapped; instead, we are looking for a good, reasonably-priced DJ who won&#039;t annoy our guests with obnoxious banter and antics. Someone pretty low-key in other words whose taste extends beyond (or avoids altogether) traditional club music and hip-hop.<br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations? Thanks!

					I know this topic has been brought up before on this forum, but I&#039;d like to get some more light shed on it.<br /><br />I hope to move to JH from the Bronx in the very near future, and the vibe I&#039;ve gotten from walking around the area (during the day) is a safe one. Nevertheless, the crime stats from the 115th precinct is alarming. The rape figures in 2008 are back up to the 1990 levels and surpass those of even the worst neighborhoods in the Bronx. I know the 115th precinct covers more than just Jackson Heights, but most neighborhoods in NYC register a significant decrease in rape over the years.<br /><br />Can anyone comment on the crimes in JH, specifically the violent crimes?<br /><br />Thanks.

					Hi,<br /><br />My fiancee, my dog and I are looking to move to Jackson Heights in the very near future. (For me in means moving back to JH, as I was born there.) In any case, we are interested in a 2 bedroom, 1+ bath in the historic district, preferably in a small garden co-op, but alternatively in a well-maintained pre-war building, for under $400k. We&#039;d also like an elevator, if only because our dog will eventually grow old and less capable of scaling a walk-up--hey, she&#039;s family!<br /><br />We took a look at an apartment in Stephen Hall, which seemed quite nice, though probably not one of the more elegant buildings in the neighborhood. Does anyone have any info about Stephen Hall? How&#039;s the upkeep? Infestation problem? Is the maintenance staff attentive and on the ball? What about its residents?<br /><br />Any info is appreciated. Thanks!<br /><br />-Adam<br />&nbsp;
