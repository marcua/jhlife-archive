				<br />After reading great things about it, I finally went to Juquila on 83rd st,a few days ago. Having been to Mexico about 10 times, I will tell you it&#039;s one of the best, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurants in NYC. All the tortillas tasted like they are made fresh. Everything tasted incredibly fresh, and flavorful. And there are items on the menu you don&#039;t see in most mexican restaurants.<br /><br />Casa Enrique in LIC, also very, very good, but can be quite a &#039;scene&#039; on busy nites.

				That may be the case, but it&#039;s against their contract with Seamless. If they want to avoid the charges, they can remove themselves from Seamless rather than screwing their customers, no?<br /><br />From their site:<br />How is the menu pricing determined?<br />The restaurants are contractually required to offer the same prices as they provide on their printed delivery menus. If for any reason you believe the prices you see on Seamless are not consistent, please notify us at help@seamless.com and we’ll reach out to the restaurant to make it right.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been quite happy rotating among El Rico Tinto, La Esquina del Camaron, and Coatzingo (and occasionally El Coyote), so I don&#039;t often try new places.&nbsp; But I recently tried Tacos Y Jugos Genesis on Woodside Avenue (mentioned above by Octavio) and it was quite good.&nbsp; I definitely recommend it if you&#039;re down that way.

				I just tried the new spot at the corner of 83rd and Northern, El Maguey, and found it a lovely experience. The decor is folklorico without being cutesy, and the service was very attentive. The food was flavorful and nicely prepared. The guacamole was really yummy and the mole dishes particularly noteworthy. The mole isn&#039;t overly sweet as is often the case. <br /><br />A really nice addition to the neighborhood! They have outdoor seating for when the weather turns....the owner told us that they are adding new dishes to differentiate themselves from other Mexican places in the area.

				I second and third Juquila for their amazing food (and ambiance) but it&#039;s a different story when trying to order over the phone for a delivery. The manager seemed to want to scam us, so we ended up walked over to the restaurant to sort it out. But other than that, excellent excellent excellent.<br /><br />Also, probably more Corona than J-Heights but Tacos Morelos is solid. Their camarones diablo is like a delicious fire in my mouth.<br /><br />And, my weeknight go-to because it&#039;s quick, cheap and tasty: El Toro Bravo. It&#039;s perfect with each meal and the people who take orders are always ontop of things.

				Most Mexicans in NYC are from Puebla. Esquina is the only place around with fish for a reason. It would be great to have more Oaxacan style restaurants here but it&#039;s just not the population. The place that comes closest to making a mole poblano that is as good as the ones I have had in Mexico is ERT, but not that close.

				La Espiga is incredible, especially on weekends when they do specials like barbacoa or these crazy parrilladas de cabeza. El Rico Tinto has the best mole at that price range in the area. But also do not neglect the carts. The one on 83 and Roosevelt in front of the Santander makes remarkable $2 tacos. 3 of these and a beer at Terraza make an incredible dinner-and-show for under $15.

Seamless charges restaurant 17.5 - 25% commission of the total order- which is a high percentage given that many restaurants run on slim profits. Plus, its almost impossible to not be on these platforms; the restaurant will definitely lose customers because of the ease of use and customers will just order from another restaurant. Kind of a catch-22. <br /><br />If I remember correctly, seamless used to charge around 10-12 percent way back. After they bought out grubhub, DiningIn, allmenu (so they can post their seamless version of the phone number instead of the actual resturants on the site), they kicked up the percentage. They recently bought out eat24 as well, so the commission they take might go up even more. Plus, they create websites with the restaurants name, with the grubhub&#039;s phone number, so that if people google the restaurant they&#039;re likely to click on the grubhub made restaurant website. Definitely increases business though, but calling in would be the best way to support the local restaurants and to keep it personal :)
