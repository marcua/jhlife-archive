				Hi all,<br />I&#039;m looking for an honest mechanic in the area.&nbsp; I read on an old thread that people liked Paul&#039;s Getty in LIC.&nbsp; Is this still true?&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; Any feedback is most appreciated.<br />Thanks!

				I switched from Paul&#039;s to Louie in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; I made the switch for two reasons -- one, Louie is much closer, and two, I had some interaction at Paul&#039;s that didn&#039;t seem quite right.&nbsp; It seemed like he was trying to convince me of something having to do with a repair, using his charm or what I perceived he thought was charm.&nbsp; Just a gut feeling, but it seemed like a good time to make the switch to Louie.&nbsp; Since I don&#039;t know much about cars, I have to really trust the mechanic not to screw me over.&nbsp; I have always had full trust in the mechanics at Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=244.msg2216#msg2216

				I just had my car fixed. my car is old, lots of miles, Nissan Quest. about two years ago the engine sensor light came on. car runs fantastic, except now I couldn&#039;t pass inspection cuz of the light. I took it to my regular mechanic in Middle Village, they charged me hundreds!!!, and gave me my inspection sticker. Eventually the light came back on and the same shop said it would cost thousands to repair, as in getting the light to go off. Recently I went to a small, under-utilized (I think by the owner&#039;s choice) shop in Maspeth on Grand Avenue and Calamus, directly across from Elmhurst Park. The guy is a nice mix of old-fashion ingenuity and solid moral character. I was road-ready for $220 and that included labor, new battery, half-tank of gas and the inspection. He wanted $50 to reset the codes by driving aggressively for 60 minutes, but he didn&#039;t push for it and I volunteered to do it myself to save some money (but coulda killed myself). Long story short, I recommend him.

				TM&amp;T Auto Service on Northern around 40th I think. People in JH recommended them to us when we moved here, and we&#039;ve been happy with them.

				I found a great honest mechanic at the Sunoco station on Northern and around 98th. Ask for Singh. He&#039;s my man.
