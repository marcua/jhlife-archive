								<div class="inner" id="msg_87238">So...I motion that we move on from flaming one another and restart this conversation on the grounds upon which it should have actually been started. Because it could have sparked some pretty fruitful and interesting on-topic discussion.<br /><br />Moderators, please keep this on topic and remove posts that deviate from the point.<br /><br />It&#039;s almost been a year since we moved here from Long Island City, and we still love it. I admit that we still go back to LIC often because many of our friends are still there, and because I was deeply engaged in community affairs and still feel a bit of a commitment having started one of the core civic groups. <br /><br />But at the end of the day, my wife and I were convinced to make the investment, and be the ones to start creating generational wealth for son, grandkids, great grandkids, etc.. A rarity for people of color. So, we thought buying a place, instead of continuing to rent, made the most sense. We couldn&#039;t afford anything in LIC, Sunnyside, or Astoria (top picks). At least not for what we wanted to buy. We wanted a forever home. A place that we&#039;d move to and never leave unless for good reason. The vision that was coming together for Washington Plaza fit the bill, striking a balance between what we wanted and what we had.<br /><br />The neighborhood is wildly different from Long Island City, namely it&#039;s extremely dense which I&#039;m not used to. We&#039;re still kind of feeling everything out and settling in mentally (we have decades to do so). But one of the things we love is how diverse it is. We had a nagging concern that our son would be the only brown boy growing up in our neighborhood, but that&#039;s far from concerning here. We appreciate that he&#039;s going to be exposed to all walks of life in our new home, because it&#039;s an upbringing both my wife and I were accustomed to. We wanted that for him.<br /><br />What about you?</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_87247">We decided to downsize in 2011 and wanted to trim our housing budget. The idea was to go where we could buy a nice apartment for cash, or mostly cash, courtesy of the profit we made on our former coop apartment, after having owned it for 23 years. <br /><br />We searched far and wide--even briefly considered New Jersey, but wanted to stay in NYC if possible. We looked a bit in Brooklyn (we had been living in upper Manhattan) but quickly concluded that with the money we had, going there would entail poor subway connections and possibly being in a neighborhood we didn&#039;t like. We spent one evening in Ditmas Park and decided we didn&#039;t like the feel of it. We also considered Inwood in Upper Manhattan and Riverdale in the Bronx--we were quite familiar with both of those neighborhoods.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a colleague living in Sunnyside recommended we look in Jackson Heights. We had not ventured to Queens, really, and didn&#039;t know much about the various neighborhoods. We started searching online and were very drawn to the beauty of the prewar apartments I saw listed in Jackson Heights. We searched Astoria, Sunnyside, and Forest Hills as well--we knew that LIC was both out of our price range and also just didn&#039;t have the feel we like. <br /><br />We wanted a 2 bed/2 bath apartment, and found slim pickings for that size of coop or condo in Astoria and Sunnyside--and in Forest Hills, the apartments we saw in our price range were so much inferior in quality to what we were seeing in Jackson Heights. Plus we loved the architecture in Jackson Heights, the garden apartment history, the low-rise feel of the main drag on 37th Avenue, etc.<br /><br />Every time I came to see an apartment or just to explore, I had this &quot;I like it here!&quot; feeling. We like shopping on 37th Ave so much more than having to cross Queens Blvd all the time if we lived in Forest Hills. <br /><br />Finally it came down to Riverdale vs Jackson Heights. We had found a very nice apartment in our price range in Riverdale, with a Hudson River view, in a bucolic, leafy setting, with a swimming pool in the back of the building. Modern apartment building with a doorman, a garage, all very nice. Our main concern was that commuting to work is not so easy from there--either you take Metro-North and have to deal with that schedule, or you take a bus to the #1 train, or you take an express bus. We didn&#039;t like the commuting situation. <br /><br />We asked a friend who had lived for a number of years in Riverdale and had moved to Jackson Heights. She strongly recommended JH as a much livelier and more interesting place to live. We made one last visit to Riverdale, then to JH, and made the decision.<br /><br />So we really came first and foremost for the quality of the housing stock here, and secondarily to avoid the dead, suburban feel and difficult commute of Riverdale. And we were thrilled when we realized that the Roosevelt/74th St Station had five subway lines. So we wanted to live as close as possible to that station.<br /><br />We like it here very much. The subway options are great, the shopping is much more varied and convenient than we had in our former apartment, and we did get into one of the garden complexes (we knew we would miss the gorgeous park in our old neighborhood, so we really wanted a garden.) We also like the diversity and interesting nature of the neighborhood, and the fact that there are many leafy, pretty streets and beautiful buildings. Aesthetically pleasing--and quite a friendly place.<br /><br /></div>

As much as we loved living there, and how entrenched we were in the community, it just didn&#039;t make sense to spend the same amount of money to literally get half the size of what we got in Jackson Heights. Yes, it&#039;s a little further out, but it&#039;s worth the extra 15 minutes on the train. I&#039;ve only ever lived in Queens neighborhoods, specifically, Sunnyside, Jamaica, and Long Island City. They each had their benefits. I feel like Jackson Heights combines a bit of the things I liked about each of the neighborhoods.<br /><br />As for Riverdale, my old boss lives there. She LOVES it. But yeah, I feel like it&#039;s a bit too suburban for us. I never really considered New Jersey. I think my pride wouldn&#039;t have allowed it to be honest. Haha. I think the neighborhood will open up new and more exciting ways for me once my son is a bit older and can make himself his own dinner. Hahaha.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_87258">Petegart--interesting question. I think about that a lot, as we are getting closer to that stage, although we might never stop working entirely. I can think of several good reasons to leave JH at that point:<br />--to be closer to children/grandchildren if they are not in NY<br />--to free up the equity in the apartment, buy a place for much less elsewhere, and be able to use the leftover money for living expenses should we find we have high medical costs, for example<br />--if we feel the need to dramatically lower living expenses by moving to a place like Florida, where expenses are overall much lower, including taxes (we do NOT want to do this--but what if we need to?)<br />--if one of us is widowed, in which case, if the one widowed was me, I might choose to move to a studio apartment on the upper west side in Manhattan, in a full-service building (doorman, handyman, zero stairs, no balky ancient elevator, elderly-friendly) where I would have more help day to day and also be within walking distance of my synagogue, the 63rd St Y, Symphony Space, Lincoln Center, Central and Riverside Parks, etc. There is simply more to do there, and more chances to connect with others, which is especially important if you are living alone. <br /><br />I actually got this notion from a former neighbor in my old neighborhood, who used to say that when she was an &quot;old lady&quot; she wanted to live in a studio apartment near the 63rd St Y, where there are lots of classes, activities, and events at a moderate cost.

I think about that a lot, as we are getting closer to that stage, although we might never stop working entirely. I can think of several good reasons to leave JH at that point:<br />--to be closer to children/grandchildren if they are not in NY<br />--to free up the equity in the apartment, buy a place for much less elsewhere, and be able to use the leftover money for living expenses should we find we have high medical costs, for example<br />--if we feel the need to dramatically lower living expenses by moving to a place like Florida, where expenses are overall much lower, including taxes (we do NOT want to do this--but what if we need to?)<br />--if one of us is widowed, in which case, if the one widowed was me, I might choose to move to a studio apartment on the upper west side in Manhattan, in a full-service building (doorman, handyman, zero stairs, no balky ancient elevator, elderly-friendly) where I would have more help day to day and also be within walking distance of my synagogue, the 63rd St Y, Symphony Space, Lincoln Center, Central and Riverside Parks, etc. There is simply more to do there, and more chances to connect with others, which is especially important if you are living alone. <br /><br />I actually got this notion from a former neighbor in my old neighborhood, who used to say that when she was an &quot;old lady&quot; she wanted to live in a studio apartment near the 63rd St Y, where there are lots of classes, activities, and events at a moderate cost. I thought that sounded like a great idea! <br /><br />All that said, JH seems like a perfectly nice place to stay for the duration, and I see many elderly staying here in their longtime apartments. I think we will stay unless one of the above circumstances changes our mind. We have a small 2bed/2bath place now, which for me is the ideal size and what I wish I could stay in always, but if I were alone, I could see going back to studio living, which is all I could afford in Manhattan. I lived in a studio on the upper west side for 9 years after college, so it doesn&#039;t phase me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />NY real estate is an investment as well. A lot of people retire and move elsewhere because they can take what they invested in real estate here and add a large portion of it to their retirement elsewhere. We moved here in 2009 and the value of our apt has skyrocketed in those 9 years. From looking at projections it&#039;s set to rise another high single digit percentage over the next year. It&#039;s pretty crazy IMO. There&#039;s no way we would have been able to easily afford something here now. (Not that it was super easy back then.. we ran ourselves out of money at the time getting in.)</div>

Hahaha.<br /><br />Hard to imagine downsizing, but we already have a larger space than we NEED, considering we only have one child. I don’t know. Maybe we’d sell one day, but I can’t imagine the upside being especially large, and thereby worth it. We bought last year. When prices were already high as hell. And frankly, despite our loan shark rate maintenance fees, I expect the mortgage to be paid off before I kick the bucket. So, ideally our son would inherit it.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_87306">A few years ago, when I was living in a one-train (F) neighborhood in Brooklyn and it took me over an hour to get to work, and every weekend there were all kinds of delays and hassles getting anywhere on the F because of work being done, I thought, Screw this. I studied a subway map to figure out how to cut my commute in half plus have more than one train nearby. I ended up focusing on Jackson Heights because of the much-shorter commute and multiple trains.<br /><br />I considered Forest Hills, too. I&#039;d been to both neighborhoods before and thought either would be fine. But one day I went to look at an apartment in Forest Hills and then one in Jackson Heights. There was such a dramatic difference when I emerged from the subway at 74th Street. The streets were ALIVE. So I ended up moving here.</div>
