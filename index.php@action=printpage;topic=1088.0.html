				I am new to the forum and am hoping to be a new JH resident. Does anyone have thoughts/inputs/opinions about the Greystones co-op? Thanks.

				I have two friends who live in different Greystone buildings on the block - both love it.&nbsp; I also think 80th street from 37th avenue to Northern Boulevard is a beautiful stretch of blocks.&nbsp; Parking in that area is a b*tch though.

				I&#039;ve always wondered why the Greystones weren&#039;t built around a single street block and were instead built on both sides of 80th street.&nbsp; My understanding is that each side has their own private garden not shared with the rest of the block.&nbsp; Why not build it like the Chateau or the Towers.&nbsp; Any one know the answer?

				The units are beautiful, and the residents clearly take a lot of pride in the buildings.&nbsp; I think that the Greystones are more expensive than most other walk ups in the neighborhood because of their historical value.&nbsp;

				I always forget I joined this board &#039;til someone links it from the yahoo group.&nbsp; LOL!<br /><br />Anyway, I lived in the Greystones for about 9 years and loved it (we only moved because we wanted more space), though I admit I was spoiled to the walk-up situation because we were on the first floor, direct from the staircase.<br /><br />One small thing though is that the gardens behind the Greystones, at least on our side that was between 79th and 80th, aren&#039;t like Dunnolly or Hawthorne (other places I&#039;ve owned co-ops in) in that not very many people use them, the grass is more like a field.&nbsp; Not being of the green thumb variety, didn&#039;t bother me much, but for the true garden enthusiasts, these aren&#039;t your central &quot;courts&quot; like many of the other co-op communities.&nbsp; (Unless they&#039;ve changed since 2003?)<br /><br />No idea why it&#039;s divided over two blocks though (in fact it always struck me odd, because its like the gardens extend into what would be the property of the other co-ops on 79th and 81st).

				I live in the Greystones on the East Side of 80th Street. The gardens in the back of our building are &quot;shared&quot; by rentals across the block (the front of those buildings face 81st Street). I don&#039;t want to engage in the kind of owner-snobbery I hear from my neighbors sometimes, but I do see that some of the renters toss trash out their windows into the garden below. The fact that the garden is shared by two different buildings does mean that it isn&#039;t as cleaned or as welled cared for as others I have seen in Jackson Heights. Other than that, the buildings are beautiful and well cared for. One great thing about walks ups, is that maintenance tends to be cheaper as there is no elevator to maintain.

				PROs<br />1)The fact that they are walk-up keeps the operating cost down.<br />2) The location on 80th St means no bus noise<br /><br />CONs<br />1) Location near 37th Ave means more noise<br />2) Layout of units are not the best<br />3) No private gardens<br />4) No fireplaces<br /><br /><br />
