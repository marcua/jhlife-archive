				It&#039;s a Asian desert treat, sticks and cream.<br /><br />They have a few places to buy it in the neighborhood, like the fruit market across from PS 69, or the market on 79th and 37th.&nbsp; The cheapest I&#039;ve seen it is 99 cents each at the large Asian supermarket on Broadway and 75th.<br /><br />The problem here is that they have the sticks with chocolate cream, and strawberry cream, and vanilla cream, plus the double dip versions.<br /><br />Apparently though, there are mango and hazelnut versions, plus chocolate stick varieties.<br /><br />One of my son&#039;s classmates got him into Yan Yan, and we are the hunt for places that sell the more eccletic flavors.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any Yan Yan fans out there?<br /><br /><br />(http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/img/prods/chocolate-snacks/17240-meiji-yan-yan-choco-dip-lg.jpg)

				And yes, as I live with a 6 year old cyber-sleuth, we already emailed Meiji foods in Singapore, with no response as of yet.

				Meiji is a Japanese company so maybe try some of the stores that are more Japan-oriented than China.&nbsp; I know there is a Japanese grocery near St. Marks place.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know of any around here but maybe the cybersleuth could do some research.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had these, but it looks like the difference between Yan-Yan and Pocky is that Yan-Yans are stick-shaped biscuits plus a frosting/dipping sauce, so you actually dip them in the frosting yourself.&nbsp; Pockys are already dipped.<br /><br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3529/4000451422_58973114e2_b.jpg)<br />

				We&#039;ll give it a whirl.&nbsp; The Pacific market actually carries less than the bodegas, just chocolate and starwberry, but it is 99 cents versus $1.25.

				So I googled Japanese markets in Queens, found one listed in Astoria/LIC, and actually had them check the shelves.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I think maybe only certain flavors are distrbuted over here.&nbsp; :(

				I&#039;m not sure what flavors there are, but I&#039;m pretty sure I saw Yan Yan (or a similar-looking container) at the asian foods store on Woodside Avenue and 61st Street (it&#039;s right by the 61st Street 7 train stop, where Roosevelt Ave and Woodside Avenue meet, next to 5 Star liquor store).<br /><br />Jin&#039;s Big Apple, in the same area (about a block below the 61st Street 7 train stop on Roosevelt Ave) also has some asian snacks, not sure if they carry this one specifically.<br /><br />There is also an asian foods store on Roosevelt Ave and 72nd Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s not clear what it is, but there is a parking lot in front of it and the store faces the lot.<br /><br />I checked Amazon.com, though, and don&#039;t see flavors other than Chocolate, Vanilla and Strawberry listed.
