					Zero Percent From the Fed? Some Analysts Say It Could Be Coming<br />by Edmund L. Andrews<br />Thursday, October 30, 2008<br />provided by<br /><br /><br />Zero percent interest rates! It sounds like free money, or maybe a promotional deal from General Motors to get people to buy Hummers. Are zero rates coming to the Federal Reserve?<br /><br />As it happens, the Fed is surprisingly close to that point already. On Wednesday, the central bank lowered its target for the federal funds rate â€” the rate that banks charge each other on overnight loans â€” to 1 percent from 1.5 percent.<br /><br />More from NYTimes.com: <br /><br />â€¢ Japan Offers Stimulus Package to Spur Its Economy <br /><br />â€¢ A Question for A.I.G.: Where Did the Cash Go? <br /><br />â€¢ Cuomo Asks for Pay Data From Banks&nbsp; <br /><br />But in practice, the actual federal funds rate fluctuates slightly around its target as the Fed carries out its open-market operations in the money markets. And because banks and financial institutions have been so frightened about lending in the last month, the actual Fed funds rate has been below 1 percent for the last two weeks. On Tuesday, it averaged only 0.67 percent.<br /><br />A growing number of analysts now predict that the economy is so weak that the Fed will have to reduce its official target to zero if it wants to jumpstart the stalled economy.<br /><br />Japanâ€™s central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate to zero for five years, from 2001 to 2006. It did so mainly to combat a particularly persistent case of deflation, a broad-based decline in consumer prices, and to revive economic growth.<br /><br />Some analysts see signs that the United States faces a similar threat. Like Japanâ€™s, American banks have become so decimated by losses in real estate that they are either unable or unwilling to resume normal lending. And as prices for oil and many other commodities have crashed during the past two weeks, some analysts now warn that deflation might be a threat here as well.<br /><br />With the Fed funds rate already down to 1 percent, and below one percent on many days, the central bank is fast approaching what economists call the â€œzero bound.â€<br /><br />If the Fed funds rate did drop to zero, it would not mean free money for consumers or businesses. The zero rate would only apply to the reserves that banks are required to maintain and that they lend to one another. Customers would still have to pay some interest, but the rates could be extremely low for some business borrowers.<br /><br />The real question for policy makers is what to do if they reach a zero rate and still want to rev up the economy. Fed officials have studied the question closely, and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, gave a famous speech on the issue when he was a Fed governor in 2002.<br /><br />More from Yahoo! Finance: <br /><br />â€¢ Exposed: Credit Cards Charging Highest Rates<br /><br />â€¢ Checking Accounts: More Expensive Than Ever<br /><br />â€¢ Why and How You Should Break Up With a Bank <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Visit the Banking &amp; Budgeting Center <br /><br />In that speech, Mr. Bernanke described a series of options. The simplest option would be for the Fed to start buying Treasury securities with longer maturities. Buying up those longer-term securities would push up their prices and drive down longer-term interest rates. If that didnâ€™t work, the Fed could start buying up privately-issued debt, like corporate bonds.<br /><br />In effect, the Federal Reserve would be printing more money and injecting it into the economy â€” a strategy of â€œquantitative easing,â€ in Fed jargon.<br /><br />Too much money would provoke a new round of inflation and perhaps yet another asset bubble. But Japanese inflation never took off. After five years, the Bank of Japan cautiously raised its benchmark rate to .5 percent. This week, published reports have suggested that it might cut the rate in half once again.<br />

					Who Is Watching the Co-op Board?<br />By Jay Romano<br /><br />Is there a state or city department that oversees the actions of co-<br />op boards to make sure they are not doing anything unethical or<br />illegal?<br />â€œCooperatives generally are organized as business corporations under<br />New York law,â€ said Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan lawyer who is<br />president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums,<br />â€œand there is no city or state agency that oversees the operations of<br />business corporations.â€<br />Mr. Luxemburg said, however, that if a co-op board was still<br />controlled by the conversion sponsor, the New York State<br />Departmentratives and Condominiumsneralâ€™s office) had jurisdiction to<br />ensure that the sponsor was carrying out its obligations under the<br />offering plan.<br />In addition, the managing agent is required to be licensed as a real<br />estate broker, and unethical conduct by a broker falls under the<br />jurisdiction of the New York Department of State.<br />Mr. Luxemburg will be conducting a seminar on legal issues facing co-<br />ops and condos at the 28th annual housing conference of the Council of<br />New York Cooperatives and Condominiums on Sunday, Nov. 16 at Baruch<br />College at 24th Street and Lexington Avenue.

					It has come to my attention that a community leader/activist has approached the owner of Pizzeria Due Fratelli located at 76-23 37th Avenue three times in the past 60 days.&nbsp; Apparently, the owner of the establishment has decided to place his bike within site, in front of a tree and flowers in front of his establishment.&nbsp; The community leader/activist has reprimanded him during these three visits and during one occasion in front of customers.&nbsp; Please note that the owner of the Pizzeria pays $6K in rent on a monthly basis.&nbsp; Such unpleasantries could potentially cause him some lose of business.&nbsp; The issue at hand is the tree.&nbsp; The community leader/activist is not very happy that a bike would be stationed near the tree as it would as well affect the flowers, etc., I guess thus the reason for the visits.&nbsp; I have not been present during the unpleasantries, but I need to understand what right a community leader/activist has to come off the street and reprimand a business owner if he/she feels fit to do so.&nbsp; In addition, why not have a private conversation about the concerns that the leader/activist may have about any potential damage to a tree and the flowers, if in fact a bike would cause such damage.&nbsp; During my lunch today at Due Fratelli I saw kids simply walk right on the flowers.&nbsp; Is the business owner of Due Fratelli supposed to reprimand this child.&nbsp; Of course the mother was off in her own world.&nbsp; Does the tree belong to Due Fratelli as has been suggested by this leader/activist.&nbsp; Also, the question would be: Who is responsible for the tree and trimmings and at what point do you contact the police if someone continues to come to your establishment to embarrass and harass you relating to these community issues.&nbsp; The owner of course does not want a problem with any one.&nbsp; He&#039;s here to make a living and get along, but I would also like to know who owns the trees on 37th Avenue and who is obligated to care for them.&nbsp; Anyone that has input please respond offline.<br />

					Reposted from Yahoo JH Families Listserv<br /><br /><strong><em>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; Edited to remove personal information]</em></strong><br /><br />A Disturbing Neighborhood Experience<br />Wednesday, September 24, 2008 9:38 PM<br /><br />Hi Folks,<br />&nbsp;<br />A few days ago I had someone follow me for six blocks (including a two-block detour) and rather aggressively try to follow me into our building.&nbsp; It was broad daylight, but I was pushing a stroller (and my two-year-old daughter had said rather loudly &quot;I want to go HOME&quot;) so we might have looked like easy targets.<br />&nbsp;<br />We had stopped for lunch at Pepino&#039;s on 37th and 76th.&nbsp; It was full and I was looking for a place to sit.&nbsp; I noticed a guy sitting alone at a table.&nbsp; There was something about him that struck me as &quot;off,&quot; so we waited for another table to open up.&nbsp; He was probably in his mid-50&#039;s, Caucasian or Latino, 6&#039; or so, and very burly with a shaved head--looked like he worked out a lot.<br />&nbsp;<br />After a few minutes, my daughter said &quot;I want to go HOME,&quot; so we set off.&nbsp; I was pushing her in the stroller down 37th when she started to fall asleep, so I walked her up to 81st, then turned around and backtracked to our street.&nbsp; I then walked up the steps to our building, and as I turned around to pull the stroller up, there was the creepy guy, grabbing the bottom of <strong><em>[edited to remove child&#039;s name]</em></strong> stroller to lift her.<br />&nbsp;<br />When we got to the door, I just waited.&nbsp; He reached for his pocket like he was going to get keys (which I knew he didn&#039;t have--our building is small and I know all our neighbors) then waited for me to open the door.&nbsp; I just looked at him, so he buzzed an apartment and then he gestured for me to open the door.&nbsp; I just waited, hoping he would leave.&nbsp; Then he buzzed another apartment, and someone answered.&nbsp; He first kept saying he was there to see &quot;Eddie&quot; and when the person inside insisted there was no Eddie there and asked his name, he then said HE was &quot;Eddie.&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />At that point, I left.&nbsp; I called the police who said they would come take a report, but of course never did.<br />&nbsp;<br />The thing that disturbed me most was that he really seemed skilled at this--he had picked us out (pregnant woman pushing a stroller and going &quot;HOME!&quot;), and his &quot;technique&quot; of pretending he had keys and looking at me like I was being rude not to let him in was really effective--he definitely made me feel guilty and uncomfortable about being so rude.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, be safe and keep your eyes open, everyone....<br />
