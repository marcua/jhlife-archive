				I think that it makes sense for the government to exercise its eminent domain powers to seize the car dealership on Northern Boulevard to expand Travers&#039; Park. I focus on the car dealership as opposed to the Garden School because the school serves a greater public good in that it provides parents in the neighborhood with greater educational options whereas the car dealership has no comparable intrinsic public good - this argument only works if one assumes that the promotion of education is a public good.&nbsp; It would be much harder to make a case for the government seizing a school in a neighborhood like JH as opposed to a car dealership, which there are already plenty of.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another reason it makes sense for the government to seize the car dealership is because there are renovations planned for Travers Park and seizing that one lot is administratively simple to the extent that there will only be one proceeding involving one lot.&nbsp; The community would reap tremendous benefits that will dwarf whatever negative consequences the landowner will suffer, i.e., the landlord will be compensated with money and will be able to buy another piece of property, whereas the public will have a larger public space intended to promote community cohesiveness and provide residents with opportunities to participate in recreational and cultural activities and/or events.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has there been any serious discussion about this issue?&nbsp; Is this the kind of community that can band together and force the government to invest more than is already planned?&nbsp;

				There is another plot - that of the Rainbow Pre-School - along side of the park and behind the car dealership. <br /><br />There is also the question of a park along Northern Blvd. The safety factor is a prime question.

				Awesome idea.<br /><br />The city should buy that land.<br /><br />Install a high fence...if u r worried about Northern Bld. Like there&#039;s already a high fence around the 34th Ave side.<br /><br />Brilliant!<br /><br />(Then again, I LOVE new positive ideas.)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;When this idea came up in the past 6-8 years and then before that, it was mentioned that the contamination of the site of the <br />Toyota repair station would be an issue. Fumes used to be pretty strong of oil coming from that area and near the little<br />ones park and it would not surprise me to find major environmental issues in the ground before we used to care as much<br />about disposing toxic fluids from cars.

				I love this idea, and there always ways to enclose the area and prevent any car accidents.&nbsp; Fencing in one side is a great idea, with exits on the streets only (as opposed to the boulevard).<br /><br />As to environmental issues, if you buy in a building on Manhattan&#039;s west side (down by Chelsea and the meat markets), you are buying into a property that is built on an EPA designated toxic site.&nbsp; There are always ways to clean the area enough, or to assure that the chemicals do no more harm.&nbsp; If the City permits these buildings, and the developers can find a way to build them to the EPA&#039;s satisfaction, then I&#039;m sure the City of New York can find a solution for any issues raised by the dealership.<br /><br />Yes, I&#039;m one of those people that generally trusts the government.

				While I am all for expansion of our local parks, I wonder how those who agree with Eminent domain would feel if it were their private property seized?&nbsp; What are the rights of the landowners??

				I would also love to see the park expanded but eminent domain is only put into practice when it will be very lucrative for the city, never for a park.&nbsp; (think basketball and baseball stadiums)...

				&nbsp; I think this is 100% the wrong use of eminent domain and was just curious what the first poster thought justified<br />taking away these 2-3 viable businesses on the block. I say look for another spot on Northern Blvd - maybe one <br />of the used car dealerships and build a recreation center for year round use. Travers Park is crowded in summer<br />in the late afternoon/evenings which is 100 or so days but we could desperately use a 365 day facility for sport<br />and activity use in Jackson Heights. <br />&nbsp; We are one of the few areas in Queens without an indoor center in the neighborhood. That could change!

				I know nothing about eminent domain. But it&#039;s easy to see why it would be great to add park space there. Currently, a lot of the space is used as a parking lot. It would be nice to see even a solution where the existing business stay, but the park (or recreational center) is built on top of it.<br /><br />But I&#039;m afraid this would be extremely expensive and legally complicated (change zoning, get current owners to agree, pay for their loss during construction...). Must more viable to find a different solution to increase park space.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s very easy to imagine what that space could be used for. For example, an extra playground (have you noticed how packed existing playgrounds get on weekend afternoons?), or more green space, or a senior gym, or a two story recreation center, with a garden at the top... I think it&#039;s worth looking into what it would take.<br /><br />We do have a couple of strong groups, JHBG and JHGA. You could reach out to them and propose. If you are willing to do much of the legwork (like spending time emailing and meeting with politicians and other groups), there&#039;s a good chance one of these groups would support you (like telling you who to meet, going with you, sparing you time on on routes they may have tried in the past).<br /><br />Just put a call over here if you want to lead the effort, a few more people might want to help with legwork. What these groups probably can not do is to run the idea for you. They are all volunteer-based and they already do what they do (JHBG does a lot of the public gardening and JHGA is responsible for the play street).<br /><br />But they have many of the connections that you&#039;d need and some experience in doing this (remember, the play street and Rory Staunton field were not there until very recently). <br />
