				Hi all, While I see lots of posts about the newly expanded tapas offerings at addictive winery, I&#039;m wondering if anyone has eaten there yet?? I have a friend visiting from out of town this weekend, and I&#039;m debating whether to try it out (or wait until I&#039;m my own and not use one of her few &quot;while in new york&quot; meals).<br />thanks in advance!

				I&#039;ve had the chorizo de la cava and the caprese salad, both were great. I went in knowing what wine I wanted and got food recommendations to go along with that. Next time I&#039;m going to have the octopus and ask for a wine recommendation.<br />I&#039;m a fan!

				My husband and I were there Sunday night for a lite dinner. We had the caprese salad which was very tasty, I almost licked my plate. My husband had the Chorizo with the shrimp. And I had Bacaloa Fish Tapas, which was cod, almost like chopped nicely spiced on some wonderful bread. We both had a glass of Riesling. Then we had for desert a creamy creme brulee. All in all a wonderful experience.

				I agree. My wife and I had dinner Friday night, and it was lovely. As others have said, it&#039;s small plates, but you can easily make a meal of it, because the tapas are so good. Great wine too, and the ambiance is wonderful. It&#039;s pretty impressive what they&#039;ve done with such a small space.

				Finally went for tapas (I had been for the coffee when they first opened).&nbsp; I have already posted about how well-designed the place is.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cozy, inviting place for an evening of tapas and excellent wine.&nbsp; Last night the place was full or almost full from 8:30 to 11:30 when I left.&nbsp; Even though my friend and I shared a very cozy table with another couple whom we did not know, we still felt we had privacy to have our own conversation.&nbsp; I think this must also be due to good design decisions.&nbsp; The acoustics and the volume of the music seemed to be perfect for being able to hear the people you&#039;re with but not so loud you have to yell to be heard.

				I&#039;ve heard that Addictive is now doing themed tasting menus on particular nights. On Wednesday they are pouring 5 wines from Chile - I think there&#039;s a visiting winery rep from Corralillo there - and pairing them with tapas dishes. The wines and plates look amazing. It&#039;s a bit pricy for me ($65) but probably worth it if you have the dough. I&#039;d be curious to hear about it if anyone on here goes or has been to a similar event in the past.

				My husband and I went for wine and tapas last night at the new location, they just opened. The place is fantastic!!!!! Call before if you want brunch this weekend because Francisco (one of the owners) said they may not be able to do brunch today (Saturday) because they are still training their staff.<br /><br />I am so happy with the Addictive shops they add so much happiness to my end of the neighborhood.

				Addictive Boutique Wine and Tapas is a total delight. For all of you that were looking for a place in the neighborhood to go have a nice glass of wine in a quiet environment (no TVs, just you and your friends talking)—this is it. It&#039;s roomy, beautifully decorated, great music, and of course, has a great wine list and tapas. Love it and so happy to support these proprietors.

				Went here for the first time last night--wonderful! Highly recommended! Aesthetically pleasing decor, attentive service, delicious wine and food, very nice atmosphere. A real boon to the neighborhood. I only wish it were closer to my apartment. We have not tried the Vietnamese sandwiches at their sister restaurant next door, but really looking forward to it.

				Hello Addictive! Just called to see if we could get in tonight (it&#039;s now 8:30 we wanted to come around 9:00) and were told it would be a 90-minute to 2-hour wait. <br /><br />Congratulations on being so busy, but can you tell me--when is a good time to come when it IS possible to get in? <br /><br />The first time we tried, it was the same thing--all booked up with no openings in sight, and we went someplace else. The second time we did get in--thought it was great--but now I&#039;d love to know when does one have to get there to not have an impossible wait? <br /><br />We live quite a long walk away and don&#039;t want to make the trip unless we know we can get in. Would love to have a time frame in mind--like, forget it if it&#039;s a weekend after 7:30 or whatever is the case. Weeknights I assume are better--or are you always this jammed? <br /><br />
