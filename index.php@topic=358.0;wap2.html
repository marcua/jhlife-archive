			Here&#039;s a vintage commercial clip from You Tube advertising the #7 train&#039;s service to the 1964 World&#039;s Fair.&nbsp; The jingle says that the cost at the time was 15 cents for the ride.&nbsp; Somewhat of a catchy tune.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkMHe0udrjQ

			Wow!&nbsp; That was great!&nbsp; Thank you for sharing!!!!&nbsp; I am still singing the tune.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D <br /><br />I came across this very different 7 train video a while back, and I really liked it.&nbsp; For very different reasons, of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2353Ecfd5s

			Interestingly enough the video mentioned by KC was made by a Native Jackson Heightser Richard Calvache. He still lives and works in the neighborhood.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)
