					Moved into our small co-op 6 years ago (one of the neighborhood originals), and for the first three, barely heard a thing from the folks upstairs.&nbsp; Then they had a kid.&nbsp; It slowed down the parents a bit, as they now walk about flat footed, but it&#039;s their child who is always running and stomping about.&nbsp; It&#039;s enough that the hanging lights shake at times.<br /><br />So I get that part of the deal of co-op living is dealing with noise, so for a while we never said anything until one day&nbsp; there was so much banging around that folks on the other end of my zoom meeting asked about it.&nbsp; So I sent an email.&nbsp; The response was that they had carpets in every room and they would try to tamp down on the running.&nbsp; If anything, the running and stomping has increased.&nbsp; It&#039;s my impression that they do not think their little girl can make that much noise.<br /><br />So I wanted to ask the forum, as I imagine some might be in either position while living in century old housing stock, what is a reasonable course here?&nbsp; How much can you push for someone to get better carpet/padding, how often can you hector them?&nbsp; Since the first email conversation generated zero results, what&#039;s the neighborly next step?&nbsp; They are nice folks and we have always gotten along.&nbsp; I have some sympathy too, as it seems like she runs them stupid, so no one is asking for perfection or silence, but the banging around is getting ridiculous.<br /><br />Or am I wrong in asking at all?&nbsp; It is just part of the deal that if someone has a kid, the people below them earn a dozen years of constant banging round?

					Spanish Gardens has been renovating units after renters move out and have been throwing out window panes.&nbsp; I grabbed five of them, one of which I used and one of which my friend used.&nbsp; I have three which anyone can come and take for free.<br /><br />The windows are 6 pane, old style looking, roughly 34&quot; x 28&quot; in size.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they are 1920&#039;s originals, but they certainly don&#039;t look like anything recently produced. The wood is in relatively good condition, a bit flaky in some areas, and all of the glass is intact (each pane is about 9&quot;x13&quot; and is separated by about an inch of wood).&nbsp; They have a brown paint on the exterior side and a white on the interior.&nbsp; I wiped them down with alcohol so there are no issues of critters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve seen these things run for about $25 at reclaim/junk shops and are good for any number of DIY projects.&nbsp; They are free for the taking. They aren&#039;t light, but certainly can be handled by a single person.&nbsp;

					Some love for Appettito off 79th!&nbsp; Been going there off and on for a bit now and never disappointed.&nbsp; Got myself some time out of purgatory for making my wife a brunch with the German Ham, Danish Bacon (cut it as thick as you like!), Russian cheese and an awesome sweet which looks alot like rugelach I bought from them.&nbsp; A wonderful part of the neighborhood.

					About a year ago made the move to percolator coffee.&nbsp; Love the strong coffee, but it means just can&#039;t go and buy a can of coffee, as it has to be bought whole bean and ground course.&nbsp; I know the Food Town on 76th has a grinder, but I thought their coffee tasted flat.&nbsp; Starbucks is an option I suppose, but wanted to know where else in the hood people get their coffee ground.&nbsp; Tired of shleping out to the TJ&#039;s in Middle Village every week for it.

					Just a little love out for Jackson Hardware, on Roosevelt tra 85th and 86th.&nbsp; I&#039;ve come to realize that between the time it takes to goto Home Depot, the finding what you need, the lines, the lack of help and the effort into finding a parking spot, there is no savings to be had on the money time continuum by going to the big box stores if the option exists locally.&nbsp; The folks there are nice and they are pretty knowledgeable.&nbsp; Hope they can get as much patronage as they can!

					Saw this article a while ago and yesterday we went out to investigate our spiritual doppleganger in Jersey.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/the-coolest-places-in-new-jersey-for-new-yorkers" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/the-coolest-places-in-new-jersey-for-new-yorkers</a><br /><br />It was definitely worth a visit.&nbsp; We noticed a number of similarities.&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp; In JH, we are used to living with a high proportion of Latins and South Asians.&nbsp; While there is bunching, all demographics tend to live amoungst one another.&nbsp; Maplewood is the same way, except that there are almost no Latins, South Asians and the whites and blacks there are rigidly segregated.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; In JH we have commercial streets thickly laced with restaurants that represent the population, 99 cent stores, pharamacies and botanics.&nbsp; We have a plethora of supermarkets, fruit stands and fabric shops.&nbsp; Again, Maplewood is the same except that it has none of those things.&nbsp; In the four blocks huddled around their NJ transit station, they have bakeries, ice cream shops, working movie theaters and bookstores and upscale eateries.&nbsp; Their Indian restaurant is a spitting image of Delhi Heights, except its a counter based shop that makes its trade on omelette (its called Amy&#039;s Omelette Shop), baked goods and coffee with a side poster offering about 7 Indian dishes.&nbsp; The Mexican place is upscale and the Colombian place has outdoor seating and it fusion based.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; Finally, the housing stock in the two hoods are the same, although Maplewood has almost no apartment buildings and Jackson Heights has almost no grand detached houses with huge yards and winding driveways.<br /><br />So if you are looking for our sister city, look no further than Maplewood NJ, or perhaps Luanda, Dhaka or Paris.&nbsp; Yes, all of those places are very much similar!<br /><br />

					Going to Spain/Portugal for a few weeks this summer and was wanting to do it by car.&nbsp; I only drove a stick once in my life to get a drunk friend home from a pub and that was a minor disaster.&nbsp; Anyone know of a driving school or private person who can give stick driving lessons?

					It&#039;s not in the JH or even within walking distance, but I figured it would be fair for here as Jackson Heighters (or Jackson Heightonians?) have a reasonably likely chance of coming across it.&nbsp; Maybe a thread can be devoted to non-JH eateries?<br /><br />Anyway, Eddie&#039;s Sweet Shop (originally Witt&#039;s Ice Cream) opened the same year Virginia McLaurin was born (1909) and it would be worth going there at least once just to experience it before it turns into a starbucks/bank/99 cent/pharmacy/et cetera.<br /><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/8095451@N08/sets/72157623511583600/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/8095451@N08/sets/72157623511583600/</a><br /><br />My chocolate egg cream was old fashioned and perfect.&nbsp; My wife&#039;s cappuccino was topped with freshly made cream.&nbsp; We&#039;ll be back for the ice cream when it&#039;s not so cold out.<br /><br />We went there before hopping into the Cinemart, another older style place right next door.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are someone who can do without stadium seating, over the top surround sound and thick crowds of folks who text on their smartphones during the film, this place may be for you.&nbsp; Cheap tickets (9 bucks) and free popcorn to boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Located in Forest Hills, on Metropolitan by Ascan.

					Parking in JH is normally difficult, but was wondering how horrendous it has become with the piles of snow taking up spots.&nbsp; We are going out to the island Saturday for a few hours in the morning and wanted to see if it was worth it to rent a car for the day instead of moving it from our spot.&nbsp; Car rentals are pretty cheap, about $25.&nbsp; How bad is that parking now?

					We will shortly be renovating our bathroom and we&#039;ve been juggling and playing this issue back and forth so long.<br /><br />We both love the idea of a walk-in shower and neither of us is the type to take baths.&nbsp; I almost can&#039;t really see a day that we leave unless there is a serious life changer going on, but we have to be mindful of the day we leave.&nbsp; I&#039;ve read enough on the net about how its dicey to have no tub in a one bath flat.&nbsp; Is the impact on the re-sale value that much?&nbsp; If it is pertinent, we live on the first floor of a walk up (Linden Court) and perhaps first floor+shower stall=good for retirees?&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to hear from buyers, perspective buyers and those in the business on this matter.&nbsp;
