Depends on whether you enjoy ferries, I guess. I personally enjoy ferries, and bonus points for free ferries. The 7 train goes to 34th and 11th Ave, and the Midtown ferry location is 39th and 11th. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like ferries, then be my guest and sit on the F train for 45 minutes, and then when you get off the F, still have to wait for a shuttle bus or walk 20 minutes to get to IKEA. The ferry, on the other hand, goes directly to IKEA.<br /><br />

					It seems the way they plan to crack down on the fireworks is to address the suppliers who bring the fireworks into the city in the first place. I don&#039;t see any mention of trying to crack down on people who are setting them off.<br /><br /><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/de-blasio-vows-crackdown-on-dangerous-and-illegal-fireworks/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/de-blasio-vows-crackdown-on-dangerous-and-illegal-fireworks/</a><br /><br /><strong>De Blasio promises to crack down on ‘dangerous’ and illegal fireworks</strong><br /><br />&quot;The city will crack down on dangerous and noisy illegal fireworks after Roman candles and bottle rockets flooded the city streets during the tumultuous summer of 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.<br /><br />“Each summer, we look forward to the right kind of fireworks … but we also know there’s a real problem with the wrong kind of fireworks,” de Blasio said during his daily virtual press conference.<br /><br />“Illegal fireworks are noisy, they disrupt the peace in neighborhoods, but they can also be dangerous, and we have to understand how important it is to ensure that illegal fireworks are confiscated, so they can’t do harm to people in communities.”<br /><br />In June 2020, 8,967 complaints of illegal fireworks were reported to the city’s 311 system from June 1 through June 21, which represents more than 320 times the 28 such calls made during the first three weeks of June 2019.<br /><br />The mayor said law enforcement will “go after” people taking fireworks from other states, in order for the Big Apple to have a calmer summer compared to last year, when fireworks were set off nearly every night in the five boroughs.<br /><br />“We’re going after the people who bring the fireworks into New York City to begin with,” Hizzoner said.<br /><br />“We’re getting right at the source. … This is what is going to help us have a safer summer.” <br /><br />The fireworks task force will have 32 officers, including 12 FDNY fire marshals and 10 deputy sheriffs, according to Sheriff Joseph Fucito. They will work in cooperation with state police in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, said Fucito.<br /><br />“What the task force is looking to do is to develop information on who the major suppliers are,” he said Wednesday during the morning press conference.<br /><br />“We’re going to look to interdict these illegal fireworks as they come into New York City — so, if we can get them before they get into the city, it’s a good thing for the people. We also want to target the sellers who peddle the illegal fireworks.”

Which One Would You Choose?</strong><br /><br />&quot;Mattie Ettenheim and Courtney Byrne-Mitchell met eight years ago while working at the Museum at Eldridge Street. Later, both took jobs in the corporate world.<br /><br />“We doubled our salaries, and it made the concept of buying actually realistic,” Mattie said. “There is no way we could have afforded to buy anything in the city while we were working in nonprofits.”<br /><br />The couple rented in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, and married three years ago, creating a portmanteau surname, Byrneheim.<br /><br />“We were aggressively saving for our future,” said Mattie, 34, who works for a tech company. Courtney, 33, works in corporate philanthropy.<br /><br />After a few years, eager to buy and planning for a baby, they moved to a rental in a co-op in Jackson Heights, Queens, to try out the area.<br /><br />“There are things you can’t know about a neighborhood until you live there,” Mattie said. In Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, for example, they lived near the infrequent 2 train, two stops after it split from the 3 train, and would often wait in frustration as several 3 trains passed by.<br /><br />“We didn’t want to live in the neighborhood without knowing those little quirks that you can’t know if you don’t live there,” she said.<br /><br />They chose Jackson Heights in part for its food, particularly Indian. “You can get food from anywhere in the world,” Courtney said. “We love street food. There are incredible taco trucks, momo trucks and fuchka trucks.”<br /><br />Their co-op building limited rentals to three years. “We liked that we had an end date,” Mattie said, as it forced them to make a decision. The apartment was too small, but they had fallen for the neighborhood.<br /><br />With a budget of up to $800,000, they were hoping to find at least two bedrooms in an elevator co-op building within walking distance of an express train to Manhattan. Mattie wanted a place that got southern and western light; Courtney didn’t care which direction the windows faced.&quot;<br /><br />Click link to read full article. <br /><br /><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/03/realestate/03HUNT-BYRNEHEIM11/03HUNT-BYRNEHEIM11-superJumbo.jpg" alt="" height="450" class="bbc_img resized" /><br /><br /><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/03/realestate/03HUNT-BYRNEHEIM10/03HUNT-BYRNEHEIM10-superJumbo.jpg" alt="" height="450" class="bbc_img resized" /><br /><br /><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/03/realestate/03HUNT-BYRNEHEIM9/merlin_188610141_4fe2e4d3-a75f-4560-842b-8f32a4a71502-superJumbo.jpg" alt="" height="450" class="bbc_img resized" /><br />

Honestly the only silver lining of the pandemic was the end of these terrible, horrible Saturday mornings. Then the moment the city declares it&#039;s reopened it&#039;s like LGA and the FAA are like &quot;wait a minute, we haven&#039;t made the residents of Jackson Heights miserable in a while; better get on that!&quot;<br /><br />But seriously, I&#039;ve never been able to understand the need for this. They claim it&#039;s runway maintenance/renovation; well, haven&#039;t they had a year and a half to do exactly that? Also, even just one more hour of sleep would go a long way towards not completely ruining my entire weekend. The noise seems to have stopped; why couldn&#039;t they have let me sleep until 7 or 8am before jolting me awake like I&#039;m in some kind of war zone?? It is truly psychological torture.<br /><br />On a side note, has anyone found a successful means of getting through this? I turn my AC unit to high and jam earplugs in my ears so deeply I get ear pain. It doesn&#039;t really make any difference.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m a really light sleeper but manage to sleep through it with a combination of Mack&#039;s silicone earplugs and and a Lectrofan white noise machine right next to the bedside (I use both routinely even when I&#039;m not expecting plane noise). My bigger problem with the noise is actually not that it wakes me up, but when it continues throughout the day, I start to feel like I can&#039;t take it anymore when it&#039;s every 90 seconds. Today&#039;s must have stopped very early because I never heard it at all. Also I should mention I live in the 80s streets, not the 70s, and it&#039;s not as loud up here.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never quite understood why they can&#039;t find some way of alerting the public when they are scheduling this maintenance. Some people might want to plan a day out of the apartment in order to avoid hearing it. Unless it&#039;s due to a sudden weather condition, the runway change is scheduled since it&#039;s scheduled maintenance, not emergency maintenance, as far as I know.
