				I kinda resent that they take up so much sidewalk when the place is really large enough to not have to. Where the tree is, pedestrians have less space than the store.<br /><br /><strong>Moderator note: This comment and following 4 posts were split from a topic about Fruita Dona</strong>

Getting off the train onto 82nd St. is like traversing an obstacle course.

				I know folks don&#039;t like the sidewalk peddlers but I think they&#039;re cool.<br /><br />They remind me of being in a Middle Eastern bazaar.

I specifically stated clothing stores. If your regular route doesn&#039;t include exiting 82nd St. subway onto 82nd St. to head to 37th Ave. then I guess you don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />

				oh, those clothing stores are incredibly obnoxious. 82nd street isn&#039;t part of my regular routine, but navigating it is ridiculous with all those bottlenecks.

				This pic was taken during a time of day when it&#039;s not that busy. Add a few shoppers with strollers going through the racks, and the entire sidewalk is consumed by cheap clothes and shoppers and strollers, with no place for pedestrians to pass.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/m60hATc.jpg)

				Daily as I pass the 5 large motorcycles parked on the sidewalk in front of the original American chicken on 37th ave.&nbsp; I often wonder how that’s legal, yet we can’t have outdoor tables for sidewalk dining

				Also 37th Ave between 74 and 73 is out of control. Some also goes onto 74th street. It seems there is zero enforcement of illegal vendors.

				And what was with all those rugs strewn along the sidewalk in front of Foodtown last week? Is that an everyday/evening occurrence?
