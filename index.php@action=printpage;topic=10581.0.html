				Hi Jimmy1Deli,<br /><br />I&#039;ve only walked into the store to check it out, and I will try your falafel soon. The neighborhood lacks a quality Middle Eastern eatery so you might want to consider a menu with more Middle Eastern items, as opposed to standard NYC deli sandwiches along with random items like lottery tickets and toilet paper. The neighborhood already has plenty of places like this. <br /><br />Just a thought -- it&#039;s great that you&#039;ve made it a point to post here, and you seem open to suggestions. <br /><br />I really am looking forward to trying your falafel, and the shawarma once the machines are up and running!<br />

				Zubloop, thanks for your suggestions, you know the Law in NYC everything takes time.&nbsp; We are going to have as much as different varieties than the rest at Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Currently, we have to carry many similar items than the rest in order to cover store expenses, but definitely we are going to specialize on middle eastern product.<br />I live here too, we are working with a printing company that&#039;s going to design a printed menu and going to start delivery in about Jan 20-24.

				Jimmy Deli, welcome to the hood! <br /><br />I went to try out their falafels.&nbsp; First the good.&nbsp; The falafel balls appear to be homemade and are fried fresh. They were hot and crispy.&nbsp; The price point is $4, which is reasonable.&nbsp; The hot sauce was tasty and not too hot.<br /><br />Now for the not so good.&nbsp; First off, if you look at the picture on their menu, you will see the type of falafel that I know and love, with a pita split on the top and stuffed to the brim with fried falafel, lettuce and tomato.&nbsp; What I received however was more like a small falafel wrap.&nbsp; Opening up the wrap and looking at each section you will notice that what is inside is like 95% falafel balls with almost nonexistent (I had to search for it to find it)&nbsp; thinly sliced tomato and with a little bit of onion and lettuce.&nbsp; I would put the proportion to about 95% falafel and 5% other fix ins.&nbsp; When my wife opened up her sandwich her initial response was &quot;where are the goodies?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Then there was the tahini sauce.&nbsp; The sauce is put inside and comes on the side as well.&nbsp; In my past experiences with many falafel places (whether Israeli, Middle Eastern or Greek), the tahini sauce is a thin, tasty sauce.&nbsp; Can&#039;t get enough of the stuff.&nbsp; At Jimmy&#039;s deli the sauce was more like a paste, that poured like caramel and was very tacky on the tongue, like peanut butter.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am hoping that Jimmy&#039;s deli is just experiencing growing pains, and will make their falafel sandwich look more like they advertise.&nbsp; I also hope they can correct their tahini sauce.&nbsp; If they can do those two things I would be a regular customer.&nbsp; It does seem like they care about our opinions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Funny but I felt the same about the falafel as well. I was wondering if the store is going to get any venting as to do gyros the way you would normally see them being slowed cooked ? The place is certainly nice on the inside.

				Ptbass75, thank you for your comment, your opening does matter to us.&nbsp; First, do to the size of the store we can&#039;t make all the souce here, therefore we have to buy it, we just found the right company and will bring their Tahini Sauce (Krinos).&nbsp; Now, in regard to the tomato, lettuce, and Onion, it depends on how you like them.&nbsp; It might be the worker mistake not asking you how you preferred to have it with, anyhow, I might have the Krinos Tahini Sauce Monday or Tuesday the most.&nbsp; We 100% care and appreciate everyone opinion, and willing to be the best.&nbsp; Again, your opinion does matter to us, and will love to hear and fix any weaknesses we might experience.&nbsp;

The most common in the shops, I find, is Israeli style; the one with the non-yogurt topping (tahini? hummus? not sure). The one I prefer is the common foodcart-style with yogurt sauce. Jimmy&#039;s doesn&#039;t have that. <br />I&#039;m not sure where I&#039;ve had it with cucumber mixed in with the lettuce and tomato, but obviously that goes perfectly with the yogurt sauce. <br />As a vegetarian, I&#039;m just happy to find falafel in an indoor, seated eatery. Finding it in a deli is fairly unusual. <br />Jimmy, I plan on having a veggie burger next time.

				Hi Jimmy,<br /><br />Thanks for listening.&nbsp; Looking forward to trying the falafel again when you get the new tahini sauce.&nbsp; <br /><br />Similar to what others have posted, I would love you to go further on the Middle Eastern cuisine.&nbsp; My concern is that the Italian deli a block from you is already an established place to go for regular deli sandwiches, and does a thriving business.&nbsp; They also have a dessert counter, and sell muffins, croissants, and breakfast items, much like you have.&nbsp; A couple blocks down from you there is a very large corner deli/convenience store that is undergoing a huge gut renovation.&nbsp; When that&#039;s completed they may impact your business.<br /><br />Well before your posting thread there was a thread on where to find good falafel in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was agreed by many the best place to do that was Plaka, a Greek restaurant about a 20 minute walk North from where you are located.&nbsp; The falafel there happens to be amazing (as well as just about everything else I&#039;ve ever tried there).&nbsp; But it is quite far. <br /><br />The key for you I think is differentiation.&nbsp; You&#039;ve already taken the right step by introducing yourself to this forum in such a wonderful way.&nbsp; You&#039;ve obviously put a lot of thought into designing a nice looking store.&nbsp; In my opinion, without completely rewriting the book I would become known as a deli/convenience store that serves a few choice Middle Eastern items done really well.&nbsp; I know you don&#039;t have much in the way of space, but maybe serving memorable falafel, gyros, kebabs, home made hummus that can go into sandwiches, etc.&nbsp; Add rice and maybe a small salad and then people have an entree they can have for dinner.&nbsp; I would consider replacing the desserts in the refrigerated dessert counter with awesome looking kebabs ripe for grilling, as well as killer spreads like babaganoush and hummus (Check out online pics of Damas in Fort Greene and there enticing refrigerated counter).&nbsp; Again, I don&#039;t think you have to go crazy with rewriting the book, just a few choice middle eastern street type foods done really well and fresh.&nbsp; We really don&#039;t have anything like that that is convenient to get to.&nbsp; I would even consider modeling yourself somewhat after Pahal Zan in Forest Hills an extremely small place that is known throughout the city as one of the best falafels and other middle eastern type foods.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link: http://pahalzan.net<br /><br />Just so you don&#039;t think I&#039;m talking out of my arse I do have a marketing bachelors and have worked for marketing departments international companies before.&nbsp; I know how expensive the rent on 37th ave is.&nbsp; I want you to succeed and thought I&#039;d throw a few ideas your way.&nbsp; I want you to stand out from the competition.<br /><br />Jax Heighters, does anyone else agree with me here?&nbsp; That you&#039;d love amazing and convenient Middle Eastern Cuisine?<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Jimmy, I see you are developing a nice range of middle eastern products.&nbsp; I would consider for those who don&#039;t speak Arabic labeling the products in English.&nbsp;

				Thanks for posting this ptbass75. I am in total agreement with you. In fact, I had heard rumor even before Jimmy1deli opened that it was going to be a Middle Eastern place. I think your absolutely right. He would be the only game in town...and if done well, it would be a great success.

				i&#039;d respectfully disagree with ptbass.<br /><br />i think that the owners of the new place are using good business acumen in not putting all of their eggs in one basket when they don&#039;t have to. i am happy to have a place serving up good middle eastern specialties, but not everyone likes falafel (and, frankly, not everyone even knows what falafel is -- just ask bill o&#039;reilly).<br /><br />having American-style sandwiches and other products on sale is a wise choice, will be a source of income, and won&#039;t detract from the integrity of the middle eastern stuff, which i look forward to trying.

				With all the respect to every opinion, and from expression &quot;don&#039;t put your eggs in one basket&quot; and do to economy weaknesses nowadays, we are not going to just be a middle eastern food store, as a matter fact, we are going to differentiate our product from Middle Eastern, American, European, and Hispanic product.&nbsp; We will do our best to serve the most common fresh Falafel with the right ingredient.&nbsp; As a business owner for the last ten years, I learn that differentiate always best for business and for community.&nbsp; In regard to competition, Having the right product with the right price is the key to success.&nbsp; <br />Best Regards

				Jimmy, sounds smart.<br /><br />DSSJH, I think we are actually on the same page<br /><br />What I meant by them not completely rewriting the book, was basically just adding a subsection a Middle Eastern type foods to their menu.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t suggesting completely changing what they have obviously worked hard to create but just having a few choice items on the menu that would differentiate them from the competition.

				Jeff, I&#039;ve thought about that episode a lot since I&#039;ve added to this post!&nbsp; Regarding Krinos Tahini I think it actually comes as a paste and still has to be made.&nbsp; I wish Jimmy the best and will try to grab another falafel soon.

				oh yeah, grub hub and seamless are great places to be. Make sure to up your prices on those menus to reflect the commission they take out of the tab. It is a convenience charge.

				Handwritten sign on storefront says this deli will be under new management soon.&nbsp; Guess they weren&#039;t able to work it out after all.&nbsp; Wonder what new manager will do differently to make it successful. I know i got jumped on for my suggestions last time but how I &#039;d love a Middle Eastern hummus/kebab/falafel joint.&nbsp; With the new addition of Central Cafe aren&#039;t there enough bodegas around that area?

				i&#039;d also love something like that, but the Jimmy 1 space is way too big for something that specialized. if the rent on, say, the old fantastic jay&#039;s internet cafe at 76th, was reasonable, that&#039;d be good. or the kids&#039; clothing store that just shuttered right near Jimmy 1.

				There seems to be a least one deli-grocery per block now.&nbsp; And even though this store has the landmarks approved storefront, the show window became crowded with signs and clutter in a matter of weeks.&nbsp; I spoke with him when he first opened, suggesting that he differentiate himself from all of the other deli-groceries, especially the one directly across the street that is reminiscent of the South Bronx in the 1970s.&nbsp; Little seems to change.<br /><br />Seemingly no research into what the neighborhood needs. Just more of the same - banks, eyebrow-threading, low-end clothes, deli groceries, drug stores.&nbsp; I will say it again.&nbsp; Our commercial property owners and merchants have zero vision and zero sense of merchandising.&nbsp; At least on 82nd Street the addition of some restored storefronts is making a difference.&nbsp; But now we have the THIRD fruit and vegetable vendor on 82nd and 37th.... one step forward, another one back or so it seems.

				i&#039;d definitely welcome more retail diversity, but the question remains, if these businesses are not what the neighborhood &quot;needs&quot; (or &quot;wants&quot;), why do they thrive? clearly, people are buying low-end clothing and getting their eyebrows threaded. would more upscale businesses do just as well? probably so -- table wine seems to be doing just fine, after all. but i patronize one or two of the threading salons and nail salons and shop in a couple of the 99 cent stores (i&#039;m a couple -- well, maybe a *few* -- years too old for a lot of the clothing stores, but they do have a clientele.

				It&#039;s probably a lot cheaper to run these kinds of places that do a high volume of business on cheap products. <br />I keep hoping that we&#039;re going to get a pub/bar/burger joint of some sort - I&#039;d even settle for a chain place like Uno&#039;s where I can go and have a drink in the neighborhood!

				If they just did a juice bar cheaper than Made 4 You, it would be successful. Price it the same as the juice cart on 37th and 82nd, and people will come.<br /><br />As for the window signs, totally agree, but when I spoke to someone at the deli on the corner of 37th and 79th about the window aesthetics, he said that didn&#039;t matter. That they make money on lottery tickets, so need all the lottery signs in the window. These deli owners just don&#039;t seem to grasp that there is a demographic in the neighborhood that cares about the look of storefronts, and will be more likely to go in if the windows look nice, and if we&#039;re not hammered with ads and chaser lights.&nbsp; ::)
