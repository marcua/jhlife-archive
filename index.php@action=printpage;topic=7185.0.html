				The people at Trader Joe&#039;s in Forest Hills have told me to get my friends and<br />neighbors to fill out the Location Request form on their website. They know how<br />crowded that Queens location has become and they say their bosses take the<br />emails and requests seriously. I think it&#039;s a long shot, but it can&#039;t hurt. If<br />you want another Trader Joe&#039;s in Queens and particularly in our area, please go<br />to this link:<br />http://www.traderjoes.com/about/location-requests-form.asp<br />Please cut and paste if it does not work directly.<br />

				Hmmm, not sure I&#039;d want trader joe&#039;s in my neighborhood exactly (big corporation), but they are pretty good. <br />I&#039;d rather fairway, but even they are getting too big that it&#039;s gotta hurt smaller stores. <br /><br />maybe they should put one in flushing, or maybe at near the museum of moving image.

				I totally agree with Jeff. If it&#039;s going to be a major chain store, let it be one that brings the neighborhood good union jobs like Fairway-- definitely not a Trader Joe&#039;s.

				Trader Joes? NO WAY! They exploit the environment, exploit suppliers, exploit communities, and exploit workers! Trader Joe&#039;s is no better than wal mart in all of their practices, in fact they use the same playbook. If you really want a food distributor try, as Jeff said Fairway or a ShopRite.

You should read your own links more closely -- that one is full of &quot;victory!&quot; messages.<br /><br />As far as the other link (http://www.traitorjoesny.com/) -- apparently Trader Joes&#039; isn&#039;t a union shop? Too bad (I do support unions, and have been a union member in the past). However, there are much worse grocery chains the UFCW could be pressuring -- for example, Key Foods and Associated supermarkets, where in some cases, like the Bushwick Associated, employees make less than the minimum wage (there&#039;s a lawsuit there). In other locations, they merely make minimum wage. I&#039;m not an expert on the topic but from what I understand, employees at Trader Joes are compensated relatively well, and have good benefits (including health insurance options, if I&#039;m not mistaken).<br /><br />I like Trader Joes and I will continue to shop there - they have great prices on staples like yogurt, half &amp; half, nuts, olive oil, lean ground beef, frozen vegetables, egg whites, and other categories. The quality is better than my local Associated, and so are the prices.<br /><br />However, I do respect the concept of keeping &#039;big box&#039; stores from opening in the neighborhood.

				The point of the first link was to illustrate that Trader Joe&#039;s does nothing to better the world, unless they are forced to. An illustrated example would be the Imokalee Workers who fought for years to get TJ to pay a penny more per pound on tomatoes to lift the wages of the pickers. Again, only because of immense pressure, not because they are a &quot;good&quot; company did they finally cave.<br /><br />Trader Joe workers are nnot compensated well for their hard work. Trader Joe&#039;s has spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employeer, but just like Fox News&#039; attempt at a similar PR, most of us have the ability to see through the campaign. <br /><br />Reason TJ has low prices? same as why Wal-Mart has low prices. They pressure the supliers to agree to artificialy low prices. <br /><br />I for one, will not stand by while people beg a multi-trillion dollar company to do business in my neighborhood. <br /><br />And remember K2000, if the &quot;big boys&quot;, Trader Joe&#039;s, Wal-Mart, Wholefoods, et.al. can get away with being terrible employeers, neighbors, and citizens, then the little guys will as well.&nbsp;

				We had a thread some time ago about the unfair treatment of grocery workers in Queens. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=3862.0<br /><br />I like Trader Joe&#039;s and will continue to shop there once a month or once every two months or so -- whenever it&#039;s convenient for me to get there.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t support a store here in Jackson Heights because of the horrible traffic congestion it would cause.&nbsp; The existing Queens Trader Joe&#039;s parking lot and surrounding streets get extremely congested, especially on weekends.&nbsp; We already have enough of that.

				I really wouldn&#039;t mind a Trader Joe&#039;s anywhere in Western Queens.&nbsp; It&#039;s not as if I&#039;d shop there all the time anyhow.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a large store and really only specializes in certain things.&nbsp; You don&#039;t buy a lot there - they don&#039;t even have big shopping carts.&nbsp; I would still shop locally too if we had one.&nbsp; I&#039;d do both.&nbsp; That&#039;s the beauty of having options.&nbsp; You buys some things here, some things there.&nbsp; &nbsp;But as far as affordable organic options, let&#039;s face it - it&#039;s not as if this area has many of them.&nbsp; Most of the grocery stores here have one tiny ass section devoted to organic and they mark it up in price.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather buy the organic at the greenmarket on Sunday - which I do - than buy organic at the local grocery store.

Stop &amp; Shop full time employees start at 11.25 per hour have full medical insurance paid by the company, full pension benifits paid for by the company, time and a half on sundays, paid holidays, sick time, personal time, and vacation. Guarenteed raises twice a year (on specfic dates so everyone knows when the raises will be), without an arbitary review by someone that may or may not like you. Oh did I mention guareentee 40 hrs per week, regardless of the sales. <br /><br />It is not &quot;sour grapes&quot; . It is called a fundemental believe in my brother and sisteers not being trampled by coporations. I take great pride in making sure my disposable income is spent in places that recognize humans as, well as humans, and not overhead. <br /><br />Do you take time out to make sure you buy fair trade coffee or not to buy blood diamonds? If yes, then take a moment to realize in your backyard people are living in wage slave system that is designed to keep them down. This is not a fantasy. The world is full of reports and non fiction studies of this system. Who coined the phrase &quot;crew members make good money for retail/grocery jobs&quot; What type of elitism is that? Shame on you for judging a man or woman because of the job they have.

				Am glad this was clarified as we really like Trader Joe&#039;s and find that the food is a good fit for our family. I see a number of slightly older folks who are<br />real pleasant as cashiers and we know some local high school grads who were lost and seem to say that their Trader Joe&#039;s job is putting them back on <br />track with a supportive work environment and good role models. I don&#039;t know the inside story but from where I stand, the products and the workers<br />look mighty fine. Would be ecstatic to have them in our neighborhood!<br />&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re talking about the rumor on a JH Facebook group, the way I saw it was that it was a rumor being floated by one person only. When pressed, she first said she heard it from a clerk at SuperFresh, and then later she claimed she had read it online, but didn&#039;t provide a link, and now she&#039;s saying she read it in the &quot;local papers.&quot; (When I googled &quot;Aldi&quot; + &quot;Jackson Heights&quot; nothing comes up that indicates one is in the works.)<br /><br />So yeah, sounds like a rumor and nothing more. Of course I&#039;d love it if it were true as it would add something new to the neighborhood instead of the same-old in terms of grocery stores or pharmacies.

				there&#039;s definitely no hard info out there,&nbsp; but in theory, Aldi could take over. this is a very small building as supermarkets go -- 10,000 square feet, according to Loop.Net -- but Aldi&#039;s specs actually say &quot;a minimum of 10,000 sq ft&quot; is required, with most locations being around 16,000. that&#039;s much, much less space than a Whole Foods will even consider and smaller than most Trader Joe&#039;s locations.
