But when they happen, the vendor is supposed to fix the mistake by charging the customer the price that was posted, and then correcting the signage, not telling the mislead customer to just suck it up because the vendor screwed up. <br /><br />If the vendor doesn&#039;t fix the mistake in the customer&#039;s favor, all the customer has to do is request a receipt and take a picture of the posted price and submit a Consumer Protection Complaint to NY State. The vendor will have to take the time to respond to it, and may have to reimburse customer, which is a really silly thing to let happen when all the person working the stand had to do was the decent and correct thing: own up to the mistake on their end and refund the customer the couple of dollars.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly what I thought. It was an honest mistake, but I&#039;m pretty sure what the vendor did was against the law.

It is absolutely deserted many days of the year. It&#039;s not <br />that people don&#039;t want to use the facilities but there is an eerie feeling especially in the winter that other parks don&#039;t have.<br />&nbsp;Central Park is charming in the winter months, for example. More staff, more attention to the grounds, event planning so <br />that people don&#039;t just go the swimming/skating/museum/theater area but actually use the whole of the Flushing Meadows Park <br />and feel welcome and safe.<br />&nbsp; And for the love of god, fix the Pavilion. That could be the lynchpin for this whole issue. That would be spectacular to have <br />a museum - or something - open there year round. It would be transformative for the park and surrounding area.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The reason why the park feels empty at times is because it isn&#039;t surrounded by a densely populated residential area, like the other parks in the city. For most, you have to plan in advance to travel there. It&#039;s also not a tourist destination.<br /><br />I do find it interesting that some describe Flushing Meadows as &quot;deserted&quot; because I play tennis there every weekend and the park is packed to the gills with people having picnics, barbecues, playing soccer, riding those funky bikes, etc. And whenever I go running at non-peak hours, I see kids playing soccer on the fields, kids using the skatepark, and random other people running.

However, they spent a lot on it, even commissioning artwork that&#039;s way over the top. I was informed they didn&#039;t really have a budget for programming, and the kid/toddler space is quite small. <br />Worth a visit for sure. <br />What is super important now in order to improve JH library is to actually use it and circulate books. <br />If they see a decline, due to people using Elmhurst, we are at risk. A librarian informed me to request books often, if they are not on the shelves. They want to have what is needed available there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Elmhurst was due for an overhaul. They&#039;ve always been either the highest or 2nd highest in circulation of the Queens libraries - and therefore one of the highest in the country. They&#039;re usually neck and neck with Flushing.

With Spectrum, I have nothing but internet connection (not even wifi) and a modem on loan and I pay 70.88/mo. I&#039;ve been with them for ten years.<br /><br />I just wanna cry.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Back when Spectrum was Time Warner/Roadrunner, I did not sign up through them directly. I signed up through Earthlink, which offered a lower rate, albeit for a lower speed. It&#039;s the same network and I get billed by Spectrum/Time Warner. They&#039;ve had the same deal for over 2 decades: $29.99 for the first 6 months, and $41.95 thereafter, no extra taxes or fees. That&#039;s the rate that I&#039;ve been paying since the 90&#039;s whenever I&#039;ve lived in NYC. I use a modem I purchased used off eBay, so I don&#039;t pay a modem fee. <br /><br />On the Spectrum website, it lists the retail rates for broadband. It&#039;s $64.99 for 60/4 speed, so you&#039;re paying approximately the correct price. You do get double the download speed as compared to my plan, but I don&#039;t care about higher speed. I can use the Web and stream HD video perfectly fine on my connection. <br /><br />If you want WiFi, you can purchase a WiFi router and hook it up to your cable modem. Or have someone you know do it if you&#039;re not comfortable enough. I actually find it quite ludicrous that Spectrum charges a monthly fee for WiFi. You&#039;d basically be paying them $5/month in perpetuity for plugging a wire into a device one time.

					I like the idea of competition, but I did the math and FIOS is as expensive or more expensive than Spectrum. I always assumed that the concept of switching to FIOS would be that you&#039;d save a substantial amount of money, but in reality you don&#039;t. This is the primary reason why it&#039;s not installed in my building. At my location, Spectrum&#039;s connection is rock-solid with consistent speeds (35/6) and it&#039;s only $42/month. FIOS does have 50/50 available for $42/month, but it only lasts for 12 months; afterwards it&#039;s $55/month, and after 2 years, it jumps even higher. In addition, you&#039;d have to purchase a new modem, or be forced to rent one for $10/month. Personally, I&#039;d rather not have to deal with them having different price tiers for different customers, and having to beg them for discounts every x number of months.

Normally, you can bundle it all up for a lower price and continue to get it extended, although I don&#039;t know how it is nowadays.

					Sammy&#039;s Halal - Chicken or combo over rice without any sauce, so I can taste the food and keep it lighter and more healthy. <br /><br />Mexican Food trucks on Roosevelt - There are better ones towards Junction, but they&#039;re too far away from me. Steak tortas, chicken tacos or quesadillas. <br /><br />Jardin de China - Closer to Corona, but has one of the best deals in the area. Massive portion of ropa vieja, rice with beans, extra bread with butter for around $7. <br /><br />Shun Wang - Moreso in Elmhurst, but has real Chinese food. Can get soy sauce chicken, roast pork, roast duck, wonton with noodles, congee for ~$5. <br /><br />AMDO Kitchen - Beef momos. <br /><br />East 21 Boy - 3 roll sushi lunch special. Usually use a random Seamless coupon I get in my e-mail to make it cheaper. <br /><br />Louie&#039;s - 2 slices of Grandma Sicilian. Best in NYC. <br /><br />

Carry a large amount? In the age of credit cards, Seamless, Paypal, Venmo, and other bank-specific pay/transfer apps, I just don&#039;t need cash too often anymore. When I don&#039;t have time to hit up an ATM, I have had to pass up certain purchases or find an alternative store to buy what I need at that time. I do make mental notes for cash-only/minimum purchase places and plan to have cash when I want to stop by those places, but businesses are missing out on impulse purchases.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That, to me, is also an issue. There isn&#039;t a convenient way to acquire cash other than making a separate trip to the bank/ATM. Back in the day, it was tolerable because cash was widely used in multiple aspects of life, but now it&#039;s become inefficient to do so because cash is so rarely used anymore. And the bank branches haven&#039;t modernized their machines. The ATMs operate slowly, only offer $20 bills, and often have long lines at peak hours. It&#039;s become a headache people want to increasingly avoid.

(personal question, don&#039;t answer if it offends you, ha ha)<br /><br />I look at it this way: non-supervising adults are not permitted within a certain distance from a child&#039;s play area. Smoking pot, smoking anything is an adult activity. No one should be smoking pot within that distance. It&#039;s not about offensiveness. If you can smell it, it is entering your nose, and behind the nose of a two-year-old is a developing brain where neural connections are being established. No one is going to do a study to find out how thc affects a baby&#039;s brain development, but I wouldn&#039;t doubt that there is some effect. <br /><br />Air pollution is detrimental to a child&#039;s brain development. Again, not about inconvenience/offensiveness.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Breathing in secondhand smoke is basically the equivalent to smoking. It&#039;s been proven in tons of studies to substantially increase risks of multiple forms of cancer and cause many other health problems. It&#039;s particularly problematic to babies and young children as their bodies and lungs are still developing. <br /><br />There is a difference between something like smoke stacks/vehicle exhaust and secondhand smoke. When people smoke in places like their apartments, restaurants, parks, beaches and other public places, the smoke is more often than not being breathed in directly by others due to proximity. Whereas the other forms aren&#039;t and only contribute to general air pollution. And if you look at the AQI (air quality index) for NYC, what you realize is that it is actually one of the best metropolitan cities in the entire world for air quality. And it&#039;s mainly because of its walkability, and ubiquity of public transportation, hybrid buses, modern cars with lower emissions, and lack of factories and industrial areas.
