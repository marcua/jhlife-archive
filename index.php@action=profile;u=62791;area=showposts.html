					We got ours from Food Bazaar. They are all $59.99 flat - no matter the size, but they say all their trees are 6-7 ft. We checked Ultima, but they were a bit too pricey for our budget so we went with FB. It&#039;s a lot less frill, they don&#039;t cut the tree for you, but if you&#039;ve got a saw at home this is pretty easy to do yourself. And you pretty much just pick the tree yourself as well (can&#039;t see it opened or anything), so it&#039;s the luck of the draw. We spent time to inspect each tree in the bunch (as best we could since they&#039;re tied up), but got really lucky and brought home a giant! A bit too big honestly...<br />So far it&#039;s great, hopefully it remains healthy/fresh (can&#039;t speak for the longevity, it&#039;s our first time getting it from Food Bazaar, we got one from the Canadians that set up shop on Northern Blvd last year). If you&#039;re trying to get a large tree on a budget, Food Bazaar is worth checking out. As far as I could tell, other than the service, the trees weren&#039;t that different from the guys outside Ultima.

					Red tailed hawk! Very cool to see, but also unusual behavior to be perched in such a heavy traffic spot and close to people. I&#039;ve seen a few hawks in the city perched in such a way, looking as if &quot;in shock&quot;. This sometimes happens if they&#039;ve had a collision, and they remain stunned for a while just perched but eventually (if not physically uninjured) regain footing and fly off. Hope this birdy was ok!

					I see a lot of cardinals in this neighborhood (and NYC in general)... given the angle/visibility/bird&#039;s condition - it&#039;s possible the crest wasn&#039;t clearly visible or occasionally the individual loses its crest (molting gone bad, parasites). Otherwise, could it be a house finch? They are common around here, and though I&#039;ve never seen one in JH, it&#039;s more likely than the tanager/flycatcher. Bright red (with brown) would be a male, and it is typical breeding season. <br /><br />I&#039;d be less confident about saying a scarlet tanager or vermillion fly catcher - latter even less likely. They both occur in NYC and now would be the time to see them, but our barely green neighborhood is an unlikely place to spot them unfortunately! A sure shot way to know is if you noticed black on the bird? Both these birds have substantial black plumage... the summer tanager is totally red (but again more likely around the parks/greener spots).

					I do not live in the co-op and therefore I don’t have enough information to decide whether or not to believe that there is a rat problem in the building. I have frequented the establishments in that building numerous times over the years and never encountered any rats. However, given logical reasoning, I do know that it would be fairly counter-productive for all of those who complained to waste that much time and energy if there was no problem to begin with. To quote my previous post: “To clarify, I support one&#039;s right to vocalize garbage/rat issues and it is completely reasonable for residents to want their premises maintain hygienic standards.”<br /><br />And since you ask, what <strong>could</strong> friendly neighbors have done <strong>instead</strong> of immediately filing numerous complaints against the landlord without concern for the stores that generate this garbage…<br /><br />Another, perhaps more harmonious, approach might be complaining but through more community-based, informal networks (i.e. talk to the super they seem to know, or the businesses directly – as they seem to have already identified potential culprits). <br />As I have previously stated, in line with the unpopular link I am considering on this thread, those in gentrifying neighborhoods might feel more comfortable accessing formal or legal means of action (i.e. 311) rather than actually speaking to their neighbors. <br /><br />For example, we have had issues with our neighbors about noise. Our first steps were to speak with the neighbor, and then the super - not jumping straight to calling the police or landlord. Had they not been cooperative, we would have followed through with legal means.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18315.msg89237.html#msg89237">Quote from: jeanette on September 27, 2018, 08:19:34 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;people moving into a neighborhood and wanting it to change to accommodate them and their tastes.&quot;<br /><br />Jasonic, that&#039;s like saying don&#039;t move into a black neighborhood unless you want to live on fried chicken. If someone wants to dine Moroccan or have fruit salad (a traditional Kwanzaa dish), merely seeking same in an A-A neighborhood is a gentrifying factor? <br /><br />There are no salad bars to speak of in JH. Fatty/unhealthy foods are something like a 10 to one ratio. Kale, touted as a super food, common in Manhattan, is <span class="bbc_u">very</span> hard to find on a menu in JH.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On this, it is a really narrow mindset to think that other cuisines (among the plethora that we have in JH) do not have healthy options. Sure kale is a superfood, but so are spinach and legumes - both of which are prominent in South Asian cuisine; so are several berry types - easily obtained (without sugar if you please) in the several juice/shake vendors in the neighborhood. JH is NOT a food desert - try out some of the healthy dishes at our Thai, Japanese, Tibetan, South Indian, Mexican, Peruvian, American ... places.<br /><br />And, I must note, it is quite inaccurate to assert that African-Americans live on fried chicken.

This is further tinted by the innuendos and, sometimes, blatant remarks made regarding lower income people in some other threads on this forum. <br /><br /><br />To clarify, I support one&#039;s right to vocalize garbage/rat issues and it is completely reasonable for residents to want their premises maintain hygienic standards. But it baffles me that there is no consideration of the “potential” consequences of such legal action. In the context of gentrification, the greedy landlords and tax laws that benefit from removing smaller businesses for ones that can pay unaffordable rents, can and will easily take advantage of such complaints – so in essence the legal approach being used may play into their hands (knowingly or unknowingly). Who is leaving that garbage out there? Looks like some may like to now pin it on K&amp;L (jk – please, I beg, don’t take K&amp;L away too)<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not that was the cause of their closing, this is not a novel link between garbage/pest complaints and gentrification. In fact, this may be an interesting read for those shocked by the absurdity of the connection: <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/06/the-most-rat-infested-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2018/06/06/the-most-rat-infested-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city/</a><br /><br />Highlight: “I think there are a lot of neighborhoods that have a lot of rats but not a lot of 311 complaints,” ...“There are rats in almost every corner of certain neighborhoods, but people just don’t call 311 because they don’t speak the language or they find [rats] to be part of their daily lives living there. But as the neighborhoods are being gentrified, more people are saying, ‘Hey, I don’t want to see that.’ &quot;<br /><br />Otherwise, if ridiculous rent increase was the issue... we have gentrification sans rats. <br />

					Maple - According to the online records I linked before, that corporation has owned the building since 1977, so records before then will be difficult to access.<br /><br />Jeffsayyes - I understand your claim that ERT was a gentrifying force, but I fundamentally disagree since the business catered to the neighborhood as it is, not to a clientele it wished for. All people in the neighborhood could be seen there and the atmosphere made people feel welcome.<br /><br />My original statement has been misconstrued: nowhere did I state or imply that white people were the ones to blame for their closing. As neighbors, we all contribute to and shape our neighborhood through our actions. I am against those who act to change the neighborhood into something they want it to be without consideration for (or inclusion of) the existing residents and cultures of Jackson Heights. These considerations are particularly relevant given the existing links between race, class, and power that have so indelibly shaped the history of New York and the country as a whole.<br /><br />To answer your question clearly: I am upset only with gentrifiers acting in bad faith (as defined in the above statement).<br /><br />Finally at this point, I realize that my commentary on gentrification, at large, maybe tangential to this particular thread. However, I feel that it was important to voice it in a broad setting. Most on the thread believe the closing of ERT is due solely to a rent increase, so I chimed in with information I gathered. The co-op complaints I spoke of were verified, though supposedly directed at the landlord rather than the business as I originally heard. Regardless, my source directly linked these complaints to the closing of the establishment. This, like all the other information we know about the situation thus far, is conjecture. Let&#039;s hope we can get closer to the truth.

					The landlord is &quot;76 01 37TH AVE REALTY&quot; and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to this page: <a href="https://www.newyorkbusinessgo.com/company/456613/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.newyorkbusinessgo.com/company/456613/</a>. With a name like that, we can&#039;t figure out if the landlord owns more than one property (LLC obscurity, as always). The management company (Tongs realty) seems to manage properties throughout the city, though I can&#039;t find too much information on them.

					Heart broken that ERT and GF are gone.. <br />I heard that in the case of ERT, the co-op behind the stores (including a well-connected resident of the building) have been filing continuous complaints against the business because they were unhappy with their garbage practices. These complaints reached the landlord, and after legal action ERT has been locked out - and I hear the landlord doesn&#039;t want them back. IMO, if their outside practices were analogous to their inside practices, they always kept a very clean and orderly restaurant/cafe. <br /><br />If true, this is a textbook example of what happens when a neighborhood gentrifies. Well-heeled new comers are investing in properties here with the expectation of changing the neighborhood to their tastes rather than embracing it. I have encountered people who have recently moved here from UES and complained about certain places being too &quot;ethnic&quot;. I just hope that this is not how the majority of newcomers feel and that such complaints (like those made by the co-op in question) remain reasonable. <br />It is important to realize this is not just affecting store owners, but also people who work and live here that consider these establishments as community hubs.
