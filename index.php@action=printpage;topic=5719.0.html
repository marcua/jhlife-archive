				I just moved into the Hampshire House last week and can&#039;t figure out why this thing is in my wall. I&#039;ve asked an electrician, google, the real estate agent (unfortunately the seller left the country and is hard to reach and he also had tenants after he moved out so he&#039;s not a sure answer anyway) as well as all my facebook friends and no one has a clue as to what this is for.<br /><br />Bad cellphone photo: (http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a2/ABedelia3/circuit.jpg)<br />Its a circuit board, hardwired directly into the electrical system.&nbsp; My friend uninstalled it and nothing adverse has happened... yet.&nbsp; The facebook consensus was that it was a government or organized crime listening device (albeit a rather conspicuously placed one&nbsp; ::)). The one serial number I could get off one of the things on the board brought up timers on google.<br /><br />Someone went to some trouble to install it, make a plate cover and etc. for it so I&#039;d hate to toss it if it has some practical purpose... I just can&#039;t figure what purpose that might be.&nbsp; Misc details that are probably unrelated but since it was on my electrical system... I think this building was built late &#039;30s, I have no phone jack in the place, no electrical outlets in the bathroom but I have 7 circuit breakers for a 1 bedroom and while this was installed in the entryway it happened to be on the same breaker as my refrigerator.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone here have an answer or theories?<br />

				I&#039;d think it&#039;s a timer, though there should be manual controls or at least a remote control. Maybe the location of it in the apt and on the wall can provide more clues?

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Cool</strong></span><br /><strong>Can&#039;t be that old...does it have any jumpers.&nbsp; I do see the 2 pin connector.&nbsp; If you connect it back as it was plug a lamp and leave it on and see what happens in a 24 hr period (imagine if it is timed to turn off at 2 am and back at 3am... :2funny: )&nbsp; <br />Also, if you have a wireless router you could do a scan or search for wireless devices with it and then do another with the breaker down.&nbsp; Now you got me all curious...</strong><br /><br /><strong>Whats the part No. ?</strong>

				Jumpers? (http://www.omanternity.com/forum/images/smilies/yolks/huh-.gif)<br /><br />It was one black and one white wire that connected it (I know wire colors have meanings I just don&#039;t know what they are...)<br /><br />Its not installed now and I actually gave it to a friend to dissect it (not that they know what they are doing but just so its not sitting on my coffee table but yet not in the garbage either) If I ever get it back I may try the 24 experiment... there were wires coming out of the plate cover though so I think the power was powering it to do something rather than it telling the power to do something (but I could be completely wrong here)<br /><br />There was no part number for the whole thing - there were a few numbers I was able to get off individual components and those are as follows:<br />GLC555 MI3R0K<br />GS 9428 GL324<br />5032 Y5Y<br />

				<strong>Jumpers are used on circuit boards to basically govern the chain of command (sort of).&nbsp; Th GL letters tell us that it was manufactured by Gold Star and you are right...seems to be a timer. </strong>
