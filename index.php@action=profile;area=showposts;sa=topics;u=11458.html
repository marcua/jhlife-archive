					I&#039;m looking for an apartment to buy, and I&#039;m surprised that so few places come equipped with a dishwasher. Even many many recently renovated apartments, and apartments that cost in the $200,000 range don&#039;t have dishwashers. What&#039;s even more surprising is when the listings boast that the kitchen is all-new, or recently upgraded, or all-new stainless steel appliances (etc)... and they <em>still</em> don&#039;t have a dishwasher. A new dishwasher is only (guessing) 500 dollars, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the apartment price. And it makes the apartment far more desireable, so sellers can probably charge more for those units.<br /><br />So, what&#039;s up with that? In an efficiency kitchen, obviously it&#039;s a matter of space. But a lot of these units are eat-in kitchen, or have enough space - if the space was used more efficiently. Does it have anything to do with the plumbing, or are there other structural reasons?<br /><br />If it&#039;s for &#039;green&#039; reasons, the EPA says that dishwashers are more energy efficient, and more water efficient, than hand-washing dishes. A load with 12 place settings (admittedly, a full load is optimum to display a dishwasher&#039;s efficiency) uses 4 gallons of water, while hand washing 12 place settings requires 27 gallons of water. It also requires more power (to heat that hot water). Even with a smaller load hand washing is less efficient. So it costs shareholders more money (on the water bill, and to heat up the furnace) not to have dishwashers installed. Maybe people don&#039;t realize that? Or is there a structural reason?<br /><br />I guess theoretically, a person could install a dishwasher in the apartment after buying the unit, but it seems unlikely that would be allowed, if there isn&#039;t a dishwasher already installed. If I don&#039;t see a dishwasher in a modern kitchen, I&#039;m assuming the building doesn&#039;t allow it.

					What are some general guidelines for what Boards want to see, in order to get approved? I&#039;ve heard that 28% debt-to-income ratio is somewhat typical. A broker told me that Boards also generally want to see two years of reserve (maintenance and mortgage) in the buyer&#039;s bank account, as well. Is that typical? I understand that some buildings will be more lenient, and others less lenient. <br /><br />I am a cash buyer, but two years additional reserve is not possible for me, even without the mortgage aspect (for the units I&#039;m interested in). I was also told that in the case of a Sponsor sale, then this two year reserve is not applicable. Is this correct?<br /><br />If I will need a two year cash reserve, then I need to lower my standards -- I&#039;ve been looking at units that are priced at the top threshold of my ability to pay in cash. I may need to look at less expensive units, with the understanding that some of my cash will need to be held in reserve, to get Board approval.<br /><br />

					What is the proper way to conduct an apartment search? I&#039;ve been looking at online real estate listing websites (Trulia, Redfin.com) and have already seen a dozen apartments. Usually, the agent who listed the apartment wants to take my contact information, and sends me additional listings to consider. These are all &#039;fee sharing&#039; type listings, that multiple agents will also send me listings for. What is the ethical approach to this, and what is most effective as a potential buyer? Should I stay with only one agent, or should I continue to scour the online sites, which so far has been working fine, as far as I can tell. &quot;Go with an agent you like&quot; -- well they all seem very nice, ethical and highly professional. I could work with any of the agents I&#039;ve already met. I don&#039;t want to waste an agent&#039;s time, I want to be an ethical shopper, and I&#039;m also wondering if I miss out on any listings by not working directly with an agent.<br /><br />Just fishing for comments, I guess.

					First time buyer, looking at Jackson Heights for a one-bedroom (first post too).<br /><br />How much can I expect my maintenance fees to increase each year, all things being equal? I understand that there are unforeseeable factors, like property tax rate increases, or necessary work on the building, so it&#039;s impossible to say for certain. But lets assume that the building is financially and structurally sound, and property tax increases are &quot;average&quot;. Looking backwards can be an okay way to predict future conditions, so I&#039;m asking those with a long history of ownership. My concern is that 20 years into the future, when I&#039;m a senior, I lose the ability to pay the maintenance fees and then lose ownership of the apartment. What is reasonable to expect?<br /><br />One reason I&#039;m asking... I was looking at a unit, and the agent told me that the spec sheet was wrong -- maintenance was not 490, it was 550 -- an 11% increase since the unit had went on the market a few weeks before. (The unit had been fully renovated so maybe it was reassessed?) <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m looking at various units, and the range of maintenance can vary by 50% (I&#039;ve seen some units under $500 dollars, and some that were over $700 dollars).<br /><br />What can I expect as far as routine maintenance increases? <br />
