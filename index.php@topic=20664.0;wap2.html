			Within a few days we will have some women&#039;s clothing to donate. While we could bring them to a charity, we&#039;d prefer to donate them directly to someone local who is either suffering due to the flood, or who otherwise is in need of clothing. Most of what we have is casual, and somewhat gender-neutral (no skirts, dresses or ruffles).<br /><br />The clothing is women&#039;s sizes 6, 8 and 10 / small and medium. For pants, the length is best suited to someone around 5&#039;2&quot; or 5&#039;3&quot;. Feel free to pass this offer on to anyone you may know. If they&#039;re not on this site, they can email me directly at nadinesg@hotmail.com to coordinate.<br /><br />Thanks!
