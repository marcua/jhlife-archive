			<strong>dotley</strong>:
			<br />
			Two mornings in a row a young black cat darted across 37th Avenue at 81 Street.&nbsp; I held my breath praying he would not get hit.<br />Has anyone else seem him/her?&nbsp; I went to Rite Aid and purchased a can of food but could not find him.<br />The two mornings that I have seen him it has been around 9 am

			update<br />I saw this kitten(about 3 months) last Tuesday on the corner of 81 St and 37th.&nbsp; I inquired at the Spanish restaurant and was told there are 5 or 6 kittens in the back of their restaurant which faces a courtyard of a rental or co op building.&nbsp; If anyone knows of a trapper, please contact me.

			<br />
			I tried to communicate with the superintendent of the building where I saw this kitten enter,&nbsp; but his English is almost non existent and so is my Spanish. he did say there are 10-15 cats and that a tenant is feeding them but I doubt he/she is getting them spayed or neutered.&nbsp; It is the rental building on the west side of 81 street just off of 37th Avenue.&nbsp; I am going to try and get a Trap Neuter and Release person to come and take these animals to be neutered and then returned and then hopefully build an outside shelter for them.&nbsp; If anyone knows anyone or wants to help please contact me<br />thank you
