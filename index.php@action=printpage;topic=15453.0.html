				A big component of this parade was guys driving their tricked-out cars full of speakers blaring at full blast. I saw a cop make one turn it down, and then they cranked it back up a quarter block later.&nbsp; It was mercifully short for a parade, though

				I am also surprised that we have enough Dominicans in this neighborhood to merit having a Dominican parade.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t check the stats (not exactly sure where to look) but my impression is that the Dominican population is very small here.&nbsp; Since we don&#039;t even have one Dominican restaurant, I am guessing my impression is most likely correct.

				I walked from 84th to 79th Streets as the parade (it was mostly noise, not much of a parade, since I saw one float followed by many vehicles with speakers blaring) as it was ending.&nbsp; My ears are still ringing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did meet up with Councilmember Dromm, and also the policewoman in charge of the parade, Ms. Irizarry (I don&#039;t know her title).&nbsp; I could not communicate with our councilmember because of the noise, but I met Ms. Iriziarry after it had passed by.&nbsp; She said, of course, that they had a permit, however, NO ONE (OF COURSE) WAS MEASURING THE DEAFENING DECIBELS OF THIS EVENT.&nbsp; The organization responsible for this event should never be allowed to hold it on 37th Avenue again. Or anywhere for that matter.&nbsp; I explained that the noise disrespected our community (they were &quot;parading&quot; in a residential area) and that her &quot;report&quot; on the parade must include the unnecessary and deafening sound that emanated from the vehicles and speakers that paraded down 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Where in New York City would something like this be acceptable? <br /><br />If you feel likewise, you need to contact:<br /><br />1. 115th Precinct Community Affairs:&nbsp; 718 533 2010<br />2. Your councilmember&#039;s office:&nbsp; &nbsp;Dromm: 718 803 6373&nbsp; ddromm@nyc.council.gov <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ferraras-Copeland: 718 651 1917&nbsp; &nbsp;CD21invites@council.nyc.gov<br />3. Community Board #3: 718 458 2707&nbsp; &nbsp;communityboard3@nyc.rr.com<br /><br />The police department ultimately approves every parade permit.&nbsp; Parade organizers that disrespect the communities they march in should not receive a permit the following year.&nbsp; We must make sure that the 115th Precinct and Ms. Irizarry accurately report on today&#039;s parade so it does not receive a permit in 2017.<br /><br />

				I actually liked watching the parade on my way to the farmers market. Yes it was loud but come on, the parade lasted about 15 minutes. And for perspective, when I lived in Inwood the cars with the speakers would turn up on my block EVERY NIGHT between midnight and 8AM the next morning from April - November.

				Maybe they aren&#039;t allowed to, or maybe they aren&#039;t willing to, parade in their neighborhood, but its pretty clear that if one would refer to a &quot;Dominican&quot; part of JH/Elmhurst/Corona, it would be to the east of 93rd street. Just an observation.&nbsp; I am totally fine with them marching here.&nbsp; <br />http://statisticalatlas.com/neighborhood/New-York/New-York/Jackson-Heights/Ancestry#data-map/tract<br /><br />While the noise of course was ridiculous, worse was the quality of the parade itself.&nbsp; It was painful to watch fellow Queens brethren carrying on in such a pathetic manner.&nbsp; I would be flat out embarrassed if that parade represented my ancestry in any way, shape or form, because there certainly is more to being Dominican than subwoofers and tricked out cars.&nbsp;

				^^I&#039;ve been to a lot of parades, and yesterday&#039;s took the cake for loudness. You want to know why? Because the loudspeakers were placed one after another in quick succession. They all cranked up the volume to 11 in order to be heard. It was so loud I felt the bass in my chest. The volume was comparable to a Metallica concert I went to many years ago.<br /><br />Was there a single live band in that parade, btw? I got off 37th Avenue as soon as possible, so only saw a portion of the parade. I actually really like parades - like watching the dancers; hearing music; being generally entertained and getting a bit of exposure to a culture different from my own. IMO, this parade didn&#039;t do anything for me other than make me worry for my ears.

				With the exception of the Halloween parade, I could live without the rest. Yes they are colorful and fun to watch, but they are all too frequent, noisy&nbsp; and disruptive.&nbsp; The weekends during the day is when most residents are busy doing errands and spending time with family or at home ready for some quiet down time.&nbsp; On several occasions I&#039;ve had my driveway blocked by a parade goer who thought it would be okay to park in my driveway.&nbsp; As some of you can attest, it takes hours for them to come and tow the car ruining the day for me. I do agree that parades in a residential area should restricted , or at least be reduced to a minimum. Wonder how&nbsp; many we&#039;ve had so far?

				Like I said. I prefer they not be held at all. Yes Jeff you are are correct.&nbsp; 37 Avenue and Northern are commercial streets that run through a residential neighborhood. While these streets are commercial,&nbsp; the neighborhood is not. There is definitely a spill over when parades happen.&nbsp; Noise, litter, parking, congestion, etc etc. Of course some people who live&nbsp; here go. I would think that people from outside Jackson Heights come to the parades as well. Does that mean we have to have a high frequency of disturbance for everyone every time?
