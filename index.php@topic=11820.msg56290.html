								<div class="inner" id="msg_56275">I know there are a couple of other people who post here and live in Washington Plaza (73rd/35th) - we got a red herring preliminary prospectus plan left outside our doors last night.&nbsp; <br /><br />At first I panicked because I got pushed out of my beloved Financial District apartment a few years ago when it went condo (I couldn&#039;t afford the $1.3 million purchase price for 650 square feet!).&nbsp; But the more I read, it seems like it&#039;s a non-eviction plan - meaning non-purchasing tenants won&#039;t be evicted.&nbsp; It still scares me a bit because they can easily find petty reasons not to renew a lease if they really want us out. <br /><br />Anyway, my main reason for writing here is to see if any other tenants looked at what they plan to charge. It seems really high to me considering there&#039;s no parking or private garden and not in the historic district.&nbsp; They plan to charge $270K for my one-bedrooom, and that is the preferential price for existing tenants. Maintenance would be $780. Nearby coops in that price range either have a much lower maintenance or a garage (or a private garden).&nbsp; <br /><br />Any opionions on that price?&nbsp; It&#039;s a good size apartment but has a lot of street noise (faces 73rd).&nbsp; Is it possible to negotiate price like if I were just buying a regular coop instead of a conversion?&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56277">I have the same concerns. I don&#039;t have any desire to buy right now. Plus the fact that I could buy somewhere else in the neighborhood with a garden and more updated appartment for about the same price. My lease is up in September and I&#039;ve afraid that they can just refuse to renew. Plus, I have a cat, which is technically against my lease even though it had been communicated to me by the super and broker that it isn&#039;t enforced (the super has a dog). I would prefer not to move, which would be costly because I have a lot of stuff and I don&#039;t know that I could find another apartment this large for the price. At the same time, I&#039;ve only lived in NYC for about a year and a half and I&#039;m not ready to invest in a neighborhood.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56279">Hi, I was hoping that you&#039;d respond!&nbsp; I read that giant book pretty carefully last night and it does say we are allowed to renew and that they can&#039;t kick us out (probably because the building is rent-stabilized). My concern is that they will find excuses like you mention - the cat, or paying rent a day late, etc. I am very happy with the management company; they are good about not raising rents (I&#039;ve only had one increase in 6 years) and there&#039;s a good chance they won&#039;t be the cutthroat types that do everything to get tenants to move out. And if I read things correctly, this won&#039;t go anywhere unless 80% of tenants agree to purchase their apartment.&nbsp; I honestly think that won&#039;t happen considering how many elderly tenants live in the complex - they have very low rents from being there so long. The guy who had my apartment before me was only paying $700. They have no incentive to buy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There&#039;s going to be a tenant meeting on Monday and I&#039;ll definitely be there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t worry to much about the cat - even if they aren&#039;t allowed in a building, once you have the cat for three months they probably can&#039;t make you get rid of it (NY law).&nbsp; From the NY Times:<br /><em>If you keep a pet openly — meaning the superintendent or doorman has seen you take your dog out for walks; it isn’t kept hidden in a bag — and your landlord does not send you an eviction notice within three months, then, depending on where you live, you may be allowed to keep that pet, regardless of what your lease says. <br /><br />The Three-Month Rule applies to co-ops throughout the five boroughs. It also applies to condominiums in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens, but not necessarily to Manhattan and the Bronx, because a different court decision affects those boroughs. </em> </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56281">I&#039;m with you Lilybell - got the prospectus last night and spent a good part of the evening going through it. It is a non-eviction conversion, thankfully. From what I&#039;ve been able to find out, according to the NYS Attorney General&#039;s office, under a non-eviction conversion plan an outside purchaser or the sponsor of an occupied apartment may not evict you. You may continue in occupancy as a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled tenant, paying rent to the outside purchaser or the sponsor, who must provide all the services required under applicable laws. I do believe all the apts in Washington Plaza are either RS or RC. However, the tenant of course has to abide by all the terms of the lease -- even those that you may have been told are &quot;unenforced&quot;. For example, when I moved in the super did tell me that while required to have X% of the apt carpeted, my neighbor downstairs was &quot;good&quot; so I shouldn&#039;t have any problems if I keep the hardwood. He was right - I kept the hardwood and haven&#039;t had any problems. Technically, this could be used as an excuse to not renew the lease, should the sponsor want to. So, if you want to stay as a renter, go through your lease and make sure you understand every term and that you as the tenant are abiding by every single one - don&#039;t give them any reason to not renew. Also, document everything - receipts for carpeting, air conditioner brackets, etc. as well as pictures of any damages from leaks, water, etc., broken appliances and the like and maintain a log of when you notified management of the damage and/or broken appliance. Make sure you return all those annoying forms the management has to send out about window guards, asbestos, etc. on time. We&#039;re supposed to be having new water supply pipes installed where they will need access to our apts in the coming month or two, you can be sure I will make sure there is carpet down by then and that the place is in pristine condition - again, the name of the game is to not give anyone any reason to not renew. <br /><br />Having said all this, I was looking at the prices and I actually didn&#039;t think they were that bad. To be honest, I thought Washington Plaza was a co-op before I moved in because unlike too many rental buildings in the neighborhood, this place is extremely well kept inside and out. My &quot;dream apt&quot; to buy would have been in the Chateau, or the Elm Court, or the Hawthorne Court - but honestly, having friends in all three buildings, they are not all they&#039;re cracked up to be. They have fireplaces - which I love - but those big interior gardens? You can&#039;t go on the grass, lay out, let kids play, etc.. Some of the buildings in the Chateau and the Courts lock the front door to the lobby at 8 or 9PM (the apt bells are in the little vestibule) -- so anyone visiting or delivering to you after has to call you and you have to go down to let them in - hope this has changed, as it makes no sense. As all those buildings are self managed per address (i.e.; each entrance is its own co-op, it is not one big co-op) the boards are picky both in who they let in, what they require and in the house rules too. Also, some apt layouts are kind of boxy whereas others are nice and airy. And, with only 12 or so apts in the co-op, not only can assessments be steep, but everyone knows your business. So other than the interior gardens you really can&#039;t use and the fireplaces, what is the difference to here? Historic District? I believe there are plans in the works to expand it (someone on JHBG may know more?) which would encompass WP. <br /><br />So, and this is just on one night&#039;s thoughts, if the plan gets accepted, I would definitely think about buying here in WP. <br /><br />I have lived in Manhattan and in JH and I can tell you, this is the largest 1 bedroom apt I have ever had. The closet space alone would have be convinced to buy! LOL Aside from the large size of the apts here, the staff are fantastic, as I said, the building and gardens are so well kept and I&#039;ve never (knock wood) had any problems with neighbors or the management company. Rare combinations in JH or anywhere in the city for that matter. While I don&#039;t think the proposed pricing and monthlies are out of this world, I do think there has to be some wiggle room too. From what I understand from others buying into conversions or converted co-ops, mortgage lenders have issues when it is not a majority owner-occupied co-op. I would guess the sponsor would know this (as would any realtors on here?) and I would think would be willing to work with you. I&#039;m not saying they&#039;ll drop tens of thousands off the price, but they should be able to work with you I would think. For me, I am wondering if a tenant can buy another apt in the building that is empty under this offering? For example, I&#039;m a one bedroom, I&#039;d like a 2 bedroom. I saw in the prospectus there are a number of 2 bedrooms vacant under the plan -- could I buy one at the insider price? If so, what does that do to my lease? Would the sponsor work with me and let me out of my lease? Just wondering as ideally, if this goes through and if they would work with me, that is what I would think to do. <br /><br />Anyway, it is still early days - I&#039;d say we have a good 6 or so months before we hear anything about this. I see you said 80% of tenants need to agree to buy for this plan to go through, Lilybell - where did you see that? I read 15% of tenants need to agree to buy for the sponsor to enact the plan. Where did you hear about the tenant meeting - or did I miss that in the prospectus? <br /><br />In any event, fingers crossed each of us get what we want - whether its staying as a renter or going in as a buyer :-) </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56284">ProdigalSon, my interpretation was same as yours re: 15% of tenants declaring intent to buy for the co-op plan to go into effect. I did some additional research on the NYSAG&#039;s website, and found that vacant apartments with buyers lined up would contribute to this 15%, and that apartments occupied by senior citizens or disabled person(s) would not. So, there are 192 apartments, and 15% would be 27 units. However (and if I&#039;m reading correctly), any apartments in which the legal tenants are elderly or disabled don&#039;t count toward the total, so say there are 32 apartments that fall into that category... Now we&#039;re looking at 15% of 160 units, or 24 units. <br /><br />Also, I think the number of vacancies right now is quite high, and I&#039;m thinking that&#039;s probably deliberate on the part of the Sponsor/Owner so they can get to that 15% more easily, and without the buy-in of current residents.<br /><br />The tenant meeting notice was posted in the elevators and lobbies this morning. It will be Monday at 7pm, somewhere in the building TBD.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think this is a great opportunity to own property in the neighborhood if the majority of the residents are interested and financially capable, but otherwise, it&#039;s a sad loss for the neighborhood. It&#039;s one of the few rental-only buildings in the neighborhood, and it going co-op, combined with the rising housing prices that are well-documented in other threads on this site, are going to further limit options for middle class families. WP has a family-oriented, working-class vibe, and I think that will soon be a thing of the past. I imagine a lot of current residents will end up being displace by this, and that&#039;s a bummer.<br /><br /></div>

I have the same problem with the shower; aside from the basement closing at 8pm it’s the only annoyances for the building. The apartments are awesome and the building and grounds are very well maintained. Plus the bonus of a doorman to accept packages and they deliver them in the evening to the tenants.&nbsp; My apartment could use new kitchen cabinets and I would absolutely replace my midget toilet if I were to buy.

I know I need new washers for the faucet handles, that&#039;s a big part of my problem, but Robinson told me about the new plumbing back in November so I&#039;ve just been waiting patiently for the changes.&nbsp; They are going to replace the faucets in the showers with just one instead of two (I think that&#039;s what he told me). <br /><br />GSMayes, I know which elderly neighbor you are referencing - I&#039;m quite sure I live in the same building as you; I think she is the head of the tenant&#039;s association.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56308">I don&#039;t know if I was in a fog or what the other morning, but I did see the notices for the tenant meeting in the lobby and elevator when I got home (and knew to look for them). As of today, no notice in the elevator in my building at least. <br /><br />Just an aside, there is a &quot;Washington Plaza Tenants Association&quot;? I never knew! <br /><br />I add to the chorus of the shower temps in the thread! Does anyone else have the problem of the noisy pipes when the shower runs? I always feel bad if I&#039;m up early and showering - like I might be waking one of my neighbors. But I have to say my biggest pet peeve is the basement/elevator shutting down at 8PM (sometimes earlier). I used to live in an apt a couple of blocks away that had the same rule, which as all you worker bees know, bites when the laundry is in the basement, you need clothes, you get home from work 7 or later and don&#039;t want to spend the weekend waiting around the laundry room for free machines. They did eventually lift the 8PM cutoff, but alas, my time was up and I moved here. I&#039;m thinking because the basement here connects all the buildings and has all those nocks and crannies, it is no doubt a security issue, which I understand. Maybe with some new security cameras installed in the basement, they could keep it open at least until the doorman goes off each night? Hope springs eternal. <br /><br />I keep going back and forth on this - leaning towards buying, then leaning to stay as a tenant. I was hoping the meeting on Monday would give some more information like you EricaS, but after seeing the notice, I&#039;m thinking this is a meeting by the WPTA and won&#039;t have a rep from the sponsors. But we&#039;ll see. </div>

When I moved into the building 6 years ago, there was a prowler in the neighborhood getting into buildings through the basements and attacking women.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s when the early locking started or if they were already doing it then. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56316">The notices about the meeting were still up in my building this morning when I left. I&#039;ll report back when I get home if they are gone.<br /><br />In my research on co-op conversions, I did learn that upon receiving the &quot;red herring,&quot; tenants typically form a Tenants Association, which thoroughly reviews the document, up to and including hiring attorneys, engineers, etc. to validate the claims made within. So my biggest question for this meeting is... Who&#039;s paying for all that? I mean, attorneys and engineers aren&#039;t cheap, and if they are representing the tenants, it would be a conflict of interest for the Sponsor to pick up the tab, one would think. So there&#039;s that, plus a million other questions that have popped into my head since Monday evening. But I don&#039;t think there has always been a WPTA, to answer your question, ProdigalSon.<br /><br />Anyway, the Sponsor can&#039;t legally prevent us from forming a T.A., and I&#039;m sure they expect it, as it&#039;s all part of the process, so I wouldn&#039;t think the porters were told to remove them. But sometimes I give people too much credit.<br /><br />Re: the basements, a while back my upstairs neighbor who has lived in the building since birth told me that the restricted hours on the basement are for security, and date back to the late 70s/early 80s, when follow-in attacks were rampant in JH. I asked her if they&#039;d ever change it, and she said she hoped not, because it was really bad back then, and there are lots of places to hide down there with all the weird corners and such.</div>
