				sadly, the teardown was scheduled more than two years ago, and no one was able to pony up the seven figures needed to save it/buy it.<br /><br /><br />having lived right here for 15 years, and in the general area my entire life, i will miss it. unfortunately, new york has become a city where the past is considered to be something to be scraped off a collective shoe.

				&nbsp;There was something off going on in this house long before it was sold. You used to see vans pull up and groups of Asian men, sometimes women, who<br />looked like they were being herded from prison into the van were walked from the side of the house. I think it was some kind of illegal immigration racket. Then when there was electrical work being done on the corner I think that they just vanished and let anything happen to the house for money<br />as they had no concern for the look of the house only that it was big enough to hold a lot of people in one place. The mansion across the street <br />disappeared in a nanosecond and we were told it was still beautiful inside with all kinds of built-in cabinetry and lighting.<br />&nbsp;We tried to get attention for this building long ago as it was scary and so close to the school...

				The Police said it was a church too. Go figure. But the neighbors found it odd that a Korean church could have someone out front of the building in a tank top, smoking and being the only one seen coming or going out of that entrance. On the side where the people were scolded and herded into the vans<br />was another story. Scary to watch. But apparently churches come in all shapes and sizes. The good thing is the ambiguity of what is happening is now over as the school board takes over. The family of the initial builder still lives on the street and they have been heartbroken to see the demise of those two beautiful homes.

				I&#039;m not seeing the problem here. The house was misused by a hideous absentee landlord and allowed to decay until it basically rotted from within. It would have needed to be pulled down anyway at this point. To be replaced by what? A McMansion? A five-story apartment building? The schools in our neighborhood are absolutely bursting, and I for one am thrilled that the city decided to use this rotting property to add some sorely needed school space.

				while i certainly agree with the sentiment that this use -- school annex, that is -- is preferable to an ugly box apartment building, i&#039;m curious where you got your information about the &quot;rotten&quot; condition of the building&#039;s interior? even when it was vacant and the yard overgrown, one could see through the window that the place was still viable and not a shell.....

				One of the greatest challenges in NYC has been the balance between new needs vs preservation. Both are important. Jackson Heights is a microcosm of those same questions.<br /><br />Regarding that corner, 34th Avenue &amp; 74th Street, the north-west (opposite the school) is an empty lot now while the north-east has the mansion we speculate about. The still standing mansion is the nicer of the two.<br /><br />Has anyone ever considered the possibility of trying to satisfy both needs? The school can have the empty lot to build on and keep the mansion there. Now that Jackson Heights is historic and a hundred years old should we consider a museum of the area? Maybe it could also have community center space?<br /><br />A museum/community center could be educational as well as preserving and enhancing the neighborhood. Can history repeat itself once again? The Queensboro Corporation had preserved the old home that sat in the middle of the golf course as a meeting center. Perhaps we need to look backwards in order to carefully move forward.<br /><br />

				Sadly, this house was built in 1941 by my aunt and uncle, Lillian Eichler and Tobias Watson.&nbsp; Dr. Watson (Uncle Toby) was a noted obstetrician in the Jackson Heights area and was a also a founder of the Physicians Hospital located across the street (also torn down).&nbsp; (He also delivered me!)&nbsp; Aunt Lillian was a noted author, most famous for writing the 20&#039;s bestseller &quot;Book of Etiquette,&quot; which in its time outsold Emily Post.&nbsp; It was their dream home and now sadly, just like them, it is gone...

				One other interesting thing is Aunt Lillian (who was my father&#039;s sister) was the daughter of Hungarian immigrants and grew up over my grandfather&#039;s cigar factory in East Harlem, alongside the Third Ave. &quot;el&quot; train.&nbsp; &nbsp;She worked her way through college and became a very successful writer, back in the 20&#039;s when women were still new at careers.&nbsp; She married Tobias Watson and together they built their &quot;dream&quot; mansion in Jackson Heights, across from his hospital, where they lived an elegant lifestyle.&nbsp; The office for his private practice was also part of the house, with a separate street entrance.&nbsp; He kept an office nurse on duty, complete with white starched uniform and cap.&nbsp; As a child, whenever I visited the home, I was always intrigued by the private doorway that would lead from the main house into the doctor&#039;s office.&nbsp; &nbsp;A local pediatrician, Dr. Borah, also shared the office and was my family doctor.

				Not to get repetitive, but here&#039;s another thank you for taking the time to share this with us.&nbsp; There was a strong sentiment in the community for saving this house.&nbsp; In my view, it could have been saved if our previous councilmember had lifted a finger to stop the School Construction Authority from purchasing it.<br /><br />In any case, if you have photos of this house or the hospital that you&#039;d like to share on our &quot;Jackson Heights of Yesteryear&quot; board, I&#039;m sure a lot of people would like to see them.<br /><br />Thanks again.

				The whole Eichler family settled in the Jackson Heights area.&nbsp; My paternal grandmother Sally (Lillian&#039;s mother) eventually settled there as well in a much more modest attached house on 85th St., which still stands.&nbsp; My father lived there with her until he married (at age 42) and he and my mother moved to an apartment in Elmhurst, where I grew up.&nbsp; Uncle Toby delivered all of the babies in the Eichler family, including me, and I was born at Physicians Hospital as I noted.&nbsp; I also went to P.S. 89 and JHS 145 (we had our graduation at the old Boulevard movie theatre--is that still standing?).&nbsp; &nbsp;The Watsons had two children--Richard who went into advertising like his mother and Anita who became a doctor like her father (Richard is deceased, but Anita lives in Palos Verdes, CA.&nbsp; (I&#039;m in Los Angeles).&nbsp; I&#039;ll check for any family photos.&nbsp; There is a children&#039;s etiquette book that Lillian wrote, &quot;Wee Moderns,&quot; which is filled with photos of Richard and Anita acting out the various etiquette lessons, all photographed in the Jackson Heights home.&nbsp; Lillian&#039;s many books are all out of print, but can be found on such sites as eBay and Amazon under either &quot;Lillian Eichler&quot; or &quot;Lillian Eichler Watson.&quot;

				<br />Memories of a mansion: Meet to lament loss of home in Jackson Heights<br />BY Nicholas Hirshon <br />DAILY NEWS WRITER <br /><br />Friday, August 26th 2011, 4:00 AM<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Todd Maisel/NewsSusan Smolin and Peter Mariotti spent yesterday poring over photos and floorplans of a mansion (below) at 74th St. and 34th Ave., recently demolished to make way for a junior high school. On the buffet line at a bustling Indian restaurant in Jackson Heights, Susan Smolin and Peter Mariotti walked past trays of tandoori chicken and samosas, smiling and laughing.<br /><br />Sitting at their table minutes later, they pored over photos of a fallen friend and swapped memories.<br /><br />&quot;Do you remember the bathrooms?&quot; Mariotti asked Smolin, describing elaborate tile murals of flamingos and ships. &quot;Spectacular bathrooms!&quot;<br /><br />Smolin responded with a grin, &quot;We weren&#039;t allowed to go into the bathrooms!&quot;<br /><br />They were talking yesterday as if at the wake for a mansion at 74th St. and 34th Ave., recently demolished to make way for a junior high school.<br /><br />The lunch seemed cathartic for Smolin, whose relatives lived in the home during her childhood, and Mariotti, who long dreamed of making the house his own.<br /><br />Mariotti, 68, agreed to purchase the home for about $1.8million in 2007, hoping to preserve it. But a confusing series of events put it in city hands instead.<br /><br />Smolin&#039;s family, meanwhile, didn&#039;t know the home was endangered until reading a Daily News article in June.<br /><br />But Smolin, 62, is clearly interested in the mansion&#039;s history: She drove two hours yesterday from her home in Pennington, N.J. - partly in the rain - to learn of its downfall from Mariotti.<br /><br />The neo-Tudor home was erected in 1941 and 1942 for Smolin&#039;s great-uncle, Dr. Tobias Watson, and his wife, Lillian, who wrote a fairly successful etiquette book.<br /><br />As a child, Smolin packed into the basement of the grand house with relatives to watch the Watsons&#039; slideshows of trips across Africa, Europe and Russia.<br /><br />She described Lillian as aloof and snooty - so much that she didn&#039;t allow Smolin and her young siblings and cousins into those fancy bathrooms.<br /><br />Mariotti hung on every word.<br /><br />He had placed only one condition on their meeting. He did not want to go by the vacant lot where the mansion had stood, fearing an onset of emotional pain.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m angry at how beautiful things are treated,&quot; he said.<br /><br />For Smolin and her relatives, the destruction of the house has had some positive impact, drawing relatives who had fallen out of touch back into contact.<br /><br />Smolin&#039;s cousin, Alan Eichler, said he was sad the family did not organize a few years earlier and help Mariotti.<br /><br />&quot;I didn&#039;t know anything about the house being in danger,&quot; said Eichler, who was delivered by Dr. Watson at a hospital that once stood across the street from the mansion.<br /><br />At the restaurant yesterday, Mariotti gave Smolin his copies of the home&#039;s original blueprints and negatives of photos he took there between 1997 and 2006.<br /><br />He groaned that he wanted to get rid of them, anyway.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a period of my life that&#039;s finished and over,&quot; Mariotti said. &quot;I can put it to bed and, hopefully not think about it anymore<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/08/26/2011-08-26_memories_of_a_mansion_two_meet_to_lament_loss_of_home_in_jackson_heights.html#ixzz1W9jnvzgE

				You think they could have saved the facade and built a school using it. I think it would have been quite beautiful and would have at least saved the look of the old mansion. It is a shame that they can tear historical and memorable buildings down so quickly. Hopefully, they hire architects that will build a pleasing looking school.

				I agree.&nbsp; I wish they had tried to build arround it, which would have kept the neighborhood in tact as well.&nbsp; I went to P.S. 89 in Elmhurst, built during the early 1900&#039;s, and they kept the original structure (including the old auditorium) and built a new high-rise behind it where the playground used to be.

				DNAinfo has a piece today on two new schools to open shortly in Jackson Heights and Corona.&nbsp; The article has a rendering of the school, I.S. 297, the construction which now occupies the former location of the old house on 34th Ave. and 74th Street that was demolished a while back.&nbsp; Also, the article states that the City plans on building a playground on the plot of land across the street from the new school.&nbsp; That&#039;s significant change coming to that area of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Two New Schools Coming to Jackson Heights and Corona (http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130222/jackson-heights/two-new-schools-coming-jackson-heights-corona)<br /><br /><br />

				Lovely that they&#039;re going to be putting a playground in that second lot.<br />On the other hand, the worried mom in me wonders what, if any, measures will be put in place to slow down traffic on 34th Avenue now that there will be even more kids there. In addition, the Q47 barrels down 74th Street, cutting between the future middle school and playground site. Can anyone who&#039;s plugged into the Community Board speak to this issue?

				good point, lindsey:<br /><br />i&#039;d be a little more concerned if this were an elementary school, but i hope some safeguards will be put in. the playground is a nice addition. it&#039;s not &quot;green space&quot; per se, but it is a good thing for kids<br />
