					Hi all, I&#039;m interested to hear your opinions on Elmjack, which is a neighborhood institution but also, from my experience, has some problems.<br />As someone whose kid has been part of the league for about a year, the biggest thing that bothers me about Elmjack is the lack of transparency about how they choose managers and, above all, their budget. Last year Elmajck announced a grant of $1.8 million from Skanska for field improvements--Costa Constantinides, the councilman from Astoria, was closely involved. Yet Elmjack doesn&#039;t seem to be registered as a nonprofit 501c3 organization; their tax returns are nowhere to be found on guidestar.org, the clearinghouse for nonprofit 990 forms. I&#039;m not even sure if they are a nonprofit, since their website is a .com and not a .org.<br />Even with these big grants coming in, the fields last year were a mess. They also continue to raise season fees for little league players; this spring it&#039;s $360, which is just an impossible expense for many families.<br />There are a lot of rumors about improper use of funds in the league. I won&#039;t repeat those here because I don&#039;t know the details. But if anyone has background to share on this, or ideas on how to make things more transparent, I&#039;d love to hear.

					Hi folks, I&#039;m either looking for encouragement or disuassion from making the leap to dog ownership--not sure which. My family has two young children (7 and 4) and a cat; partner and I both work full-time (though some of that time is from home). We live in a 2-bedroom apartment with no yard access. I want to adopt a dog. Am I nuts?<br />A big part of the pro-pupper case is for my kids to experience growing up with a dog (I absolutely adored my dog when I was a kid), and also to give a home to a great pet that is currently homeless. My main worry is finding time to walk the dog in the mornings and evenings, given the need to get ready for school, cook dinner at night, etc. <br />Would love to hear from other dog-owners, especially with kids, on whether this is something you think can work.

					The adults in my house are addicted to the Netflix series &quot;Narcos,&quot; about the rise and fall of Colombian drug cartels in the 1980s and 1990s. <br />Last night we watched episode 6 of the third season, which includes a sub-plot about a Cuban-American journalist in Queens who is assasinated after reporting on the cartel. I realized this was the story of the real-life Miguel de Dios Unanue, who was shot near 82nd street, where there is a now a pedestrian triangle named in his honor. It was good to see his sacrifice remembered and shared with a new audience who may not have known about him.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/journalist-slay-avenged-death-cali-druglord-article-1.716911" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/journalist-slay-avenged-death-cali-druglord-article-1.716911</a>

					You all probably saw already that there was a major gas leak on 72nd Street and Broadway, prompting the evacuation of several buildings and the suspension of 7 train service.<br /><br /><a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/03/gas-leak-queens-7-train/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/03/gas-leak-queens-7-train/</a><br /><br />We live a few blocks away, and the super said our gas could be shut off for up to three days--that&#039;s a long time to go without being able to make a cup of tea! <br />Does anyone have more intel on the extent of the outage, and how long it might last? The National Grid website is pretty much useless in this regard.

					This afternoon I was sitting with a friend by the sprinkler area of Travers Park, watching our kids zoom around on scooters. We smelled marijuana and joked about it for a second. A few minutes later, another friend came over and said we’d missed the action. Apparently two undercover officers had busted the marijuana smokers in one of the handball courts, handcuffed them, and taken them away in a patrol car.<br />It’s a small thing, but it bothered me, so I decided to come here to post. First, if you have any teenagers/young adults in your life, please remind them that policing in NYC is still aggressive. They&#039;re looking for reasons to make arrests. God forbid any of the kids that were arrested today are also undocumented.<br />Second, I was surprised to learn there were undercover officers in the park. In all my years of going to Travers, I have never once seen a uniformed officer walk through it. This sort of policing—showing your face, talking with people—would be very different from went on today, which is more akin to waiting on the side of a highway with a radar gun. <br />What do y’all think? Are we any closer to seeing community policing in Jackson Heights, or is this still just something the mayor talks about on the radio?<br />And yes, I know I need to start going to the 112th Precinct meetings. <br />

					Hi everyone, we have two handsome goldfish who are growing like mad and are getting too big for their tank. Does anyone know of a zoo/park with koi pond/library aquarium that might be interested in taking them? Or perhaps someone on this list with a larger tank? Thanks, -L<br /><br /><br /><br />

					Hi folks, would love to hear from any neighbors on your experience fostering dogs. Would you recommend doing it if you have young children? Does anyone have a local animal rescue group they would especially recommend working with?

					Hi everyone,<br />I live in a large rental building near 75th street. Recently there have been some very disturbing anonymous attacks against one of my neighbors, with paint and racist epithets left on her door overnight. For many reasons and this incident in particular, I want my building to get security cameras installed--at least in the entrances to the lobby and basement.<br />My question for all of you is:<br />1. How common are security cameras in neighborhood buildings? Does yours have one? <br />2. Does anyone have advice on successfully convincing management companies to install security cameras?<br />3. In general, I&#039;d love to hear of any resources for organizing tenants in rental buildings to demand needed upgrades (such as cameras or ramps for senior citizens).<br /><br />(Edited to note that I probably posted this in the wrong part of the Forum: could the moderator please move it to the appropriate place? Thanks!)<br />
