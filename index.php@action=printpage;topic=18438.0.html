				https://www.misfithiveentertainment.com/the-hive-2<br /><br />On 61st Street, next to Blue Cups Cafe.<br /><br />&nbsp;A huge comedy and art gallery and film and theater and music space.<br /><br />Plus it&#039;s stunningly designed. And let me say it again, immense in size. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s actually the type of creative place that&#039;s mostly in Bushwick in NYC. (Young Artists)<br /><br />So maybe Woodside is turning into a Western Queens version of Bushwick? Makes sense. There are warehouses and spaces in Woodside that aren&#039;t elsewhere in Western Queens. Like in Bushwick/Ridgewood.

				They also have an antique shop halfway up the block, but the hours seem to be somewhat erratic. Craig, the guy who runs the antique store said the best nights for the comedy shows are Monday and Friday evenings. He said they also have a used bookstore inside the venue.

				There has been a terrific street art wall on the building, which has been there for a while. A couple pretty well known out of town arts.
