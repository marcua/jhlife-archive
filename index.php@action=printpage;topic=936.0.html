				Over the past couple of months, JH Green (http://www.jhgreen.org/), Friends of Travers Park (http://www.jhbg.org/committees/traversPark/park.html), the Western Jackson Heights Alliance (http://www.wjha.org/) and Transportation Alternatives (http://www.transalt.org/) have been working hard to open the block of 78th Street next to Travers Park as a &quot;play street&quot; on Sundays during the summer and fall of 2008.&nbsp; Their vision is that the street could be used for a wide variety of active and passive recreational activities, to help relieve the extremely overcrowded conditions in Travers Park itself.&nbsp; Some of the space may also be used to allow an expansion of the Greenmarket to allow participation of a wider variety of vendors.<br /><br />A brochure describing the initiative can be downloaded here: http://www.jhgreen.org/proposal/78thSt.pdf (large file - 8 MB).<br /><br />The 78th Street Summer Sundays Project has already secured the endorsement of many key stakeholders, and the organizers are working closely with the city and elected officials to bring the plan to fruition.&nbsp; The CB3 Transportation Committee will be meeting to discuss the proposal at 7:30 pm on Thursday evening, 5/29 (at 82-11 37th Avenue, Suite 606).<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, there will be plenty of ways to get involved.&nbsp; Once the proposal hopefully wins final approval, the organizers will be working to provide a wide variety of innovative programming in order to make maximum use of this new community resource.&nbsp; This will require ideas and volunteers, and of course people to come hang out and have fun.&nbsp; If you&#039;d like to get involved, please contact the organizations above.<br /><br />Got an idea?&nbsp; Let us know here!

				If some of the activities are moved to the street, can we get some Green space for inside the park (i.e. public lawn space)? I think this proposal should be pared with a proposal to renovate and expand the park as well.

				Spanishfish - <br />That&#039;s exactly the idea!&nbsp; JH Green and Friends of Travers Park have been working to expand the park by purchasing the Toyota dealership property.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a long-term project (see the JH Green website for details).&nbsp; The 78th Street project can be implemented immediately.

				Will there be more vendors at the Farmer&#039;s market this weekend, or is that something that will happen in the future? Either way, I&#039;ll stop by- this sounds like a great idea, and I really hope it succeeds!

				So I was wondering how publicized 78th street play street was. I only recently found out about it because of a flier I saw on my way in and out of a store. I could easily have missed it as I currently don&#039;t live in the neighborhood, but being someone who works with community organizations in JH, I figured I might have heard of it. <br /><br />Also, is this planned to go on every Sunday and if so, are different kids workshops being given each week?

				It would be great if on future weeks some sort of a sign was posted at 34th and one at Northern. I was there at multiple times throughout the day and saw people walking by with strollers, looking in and not sure what it was, just kept walking by.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure word will spread as time passes and the street will start to get more use. It just seemed underutilized yesterday.

				NatLopez and spanishfish --&nbsp; Getting the Play Street set up the first time was a long process fraught with uncertainty.&nbsp; It was hard to be completely sure it was going to happen until it actually happened.&nbsp; Until the last minute, the necessary approvals weren&#039;t even in place to put up signage.&nbsp; Now that all approvals are in place, outreach will begin in earnest to invite the community to participate.&nbsp; And we&#039;ll try to come up with some attractive durable signage like the Summer Sundays signs in Travers Park.<br /><br />Programming will vary from week to week.&nbsp; Sometimes, there will be organized activities, for kids, adults, or both.&nbsp; Other times (probably most of the time), the street will simply be open for people to enjoy as they wish.<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to help and get involved.&nbsp; We&#039;re setting up a number of different volunteer committees, on publicity, activity organizing, set up and clean up, fundraising, etc.&nbsp; To find out more, please contact <del>78thplaystreet@google.com</del> 78thplaystreet@gmail.com (thanks, Will!).<br />

				Went by today with my daughter to check out the play street and it was a ghost town!&nbsp; I had a thought - maybe we need to show the kids how to use this amenity.&nbsp; Too hot and too late this week, but I&#039;m thinking about setting up a pick-up game of Red Rover next Sunday morning - who&#039;s in? (Red Rover, Red Rover, send toddg on over!...)

				Julie, if the hour is not too late for her, try coming back around six.&nbsp; Between about 1 and 5, when there&#039;s very little shade on the street and the heat is oppressive, everyone goes into hiding.&nbsp; But in the mornings and evenings it can get more crowded.&nbsp; This morning, we had arts and crafts for the kids and there was quite a crowd.<br /><br />

				Sara(h)? C and I were on the 4-8 shift and we had lots of budding Pollocks. They came in waves which kept us busy. While that was going on there was a game of ball going on down the street. Some form of T ball. Also bike riders and balance bike riders. Ages were about 3-9. Oh, I forgot the many chalk artists! Very popular.<br /><br />The only trouble was 2 boys who decided to finger paint the lamp post. We thought they were working on the street. A little elbow grease and water fixed that.<br /><br />Definitely fits and starts. Just when we were washing paint brushes another wave show up.<br /><br />Lots of kids left their art work, so next week we will bring it back and see if there are any claimers.

				While I appreciate the effort, closing a street with a police barricade, does not more green space make. It should keep the street cleaner though. But letting kids play on the block where a lot of dogs get walked..&lt;yech&gt;<br /><br />Wish they would close off 34th between 77th and 78th so the Green market could make better use of the area. Can barely walk by the stalls on the 5&#039; path the green grocers leave and you end up walking on the cobble stones and trampling the root area of the few remaining large/old/blooming trees in the area. The two trees on the south-west corner of Travers Park are starting to show the stress

				I think that the green market should move onto the &quot;closed off&quot; street ( i.e. 78Th Street) and expand.&nbsp; Maybe they could occupy the corner closest to Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Then the rest of the block would be for children&#039;s activities. That patch of land that your talking about on 34Th Avenue b/t 78 and 77Th Streets would be better utilized as an Art expo area or for small group activities.&nbsp; And less, while closing off the street doesn&#039;t make it any greener,&nbsp; it gives the community more latitude regarding space to play.

				More on the 78th Street Play Street from today&#039;s <strong>New York Times:</strong><br /><br /><strong>The New York Times</strong><br />Neighbors Use Cityâ€™s Street Closings as a Way to Expand Their Park (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/nyregion/04jackson.html?bl&amp;ex=1217995200&amp;en=24b191a01376d45d&amp;ei=5087%0A)<br />By FERNANDA SANTOS<br />Published: August 4, 2008<br /><br />While city officials have begun a program to turn streets into car-free zones as a way of increasing open space, a small band of residents in a dense and diverse corner of western Queens have championed their own effort to use a roadway to make more room for their children to play.<br /><br />The residents wanted an inexpensive and simple way to somehow expand their neighborhoodâ€™s only park, the 1.9-acre Travers Park in Jackson Heights, and an effort by the city to close off roadways for car-free use gave the plan some traction.<br /><br />Receiving a permit to temporarily close a blocklong section of 78th Street on Sundays is the fruit of the groupâ€™s effort. Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and a father of two, learned in January that a friend was working for the cityâ€™s Transportation Department, identifying neighborhoods that lacked public space.<br /><br />â€œAnd thatâ€™s what got things started,â€ Mr. Hayduk said on Sunday.<br /><br />The Bloomberg administration started several small-scale efforts to turn streets into car-free zones as a way of increasing open space and reducing traffic and pollution after state legislators defeated its congestion-pricing plan, which would have charged drivers to enter Manhattan below 59th Street.<br /><br />City officials in July announced the permanent closing of two traffic lanes on Broadway, from 34th Street to Times Square in Manhattan, to make more room for pedestrians and sidewalk cafes. That closing is scheduled to begin later this month. On Saturday, seven miles of roadway along Lafayette Street and Park Avenue will be shut down to cars from the Brooklyn Bridge to Central Park, and then again on Aug. 16 and 23, in a pilot program.<br /><br />New York City has more than 28,000 acres of municipal parkland â€” from playgrounds and neighborhood parks to golf courses, beaches and ball fields. Roughly one-quarter of it is in Queens, though the space is unevenly distributed. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in the boroughâ€™s northern edge, has 1,200 acres, and the Rockaway Peninsula has seven miles of beachfront. But there is only one park in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Travers Park is perhaps a bit longer than a football field and rarely empty during the warm months. It has handball and basketball courts that host cricket and softball games on weekends and tai chi classes on weekdays. On Sunday, it had children playing tag while teenagers rode their scooters, not far from where a group of men played soccer.<br /><br />The park has some bushes, a few trees and hardly any grass. Some parents have nicknamed it â€œconcrete jungleâ€ because the ground is covered with cement.<br /><br />The grass-roots undertaking in Jackson Heights sprouted from discussions in corner markets, in coffee shops and at meetings of several civic groups. The many ideas to improve Travers Park included buying the land now occupied by a car dealership that abuts it to the south to enlarge it.<br /><br /><em><strong>Follow above link for complete article.</strong></em>

				Hello! Just wanted to quickly post a little about the 78th Street Play Street.<br /><br />This <strong>Sunday Sep 28th</strong> - The Fire Department will set up a &quot;Smoke House,&quot; from 10am to 3pm or so.&nbsp; This is a trailer that teaches people fire safety techniques. The trailer fills up with smoke and the FDNY explains how people should stay close to the ground and feel their way out of the smoke house. They&#039;ll also have informational materials and some giveaways.<br /><br />Engine 307 is scheduled to bring a Fire Truck as well, most likely between 1pm and 4pm but this can&#039;t be guaranteed.<br /><br />Next<strong> Sunday Oct 5th</strong> - De Facto Dance will be performing &quot;a dancer is a person is a dancer&quot; at 11m and noon. This can be described as a performance where <em>&quot;dancers will play with the boundary between &quot;dancer&quot; and &quot;regular person;&quot; passers-by may at first wonder what exactly is going on, and then see that the dancers are doing something serious and craftsmanlike, yet playful.&quot;</em><br /><br />Also, <strong>we need volunteers!</strong> We need some people to help out by keeping an eye on the street for a while. If you have a couple of spare hours on any particular Sunday please let me know and we can add you to the list of volunteers. It&#039;s a fun, easy way to spend some time, all you need to do is monitor the street, maybe help out with kids and the art supplies if you want, supervise some games, whatever you want. Even if you can only help out once that&#039;s perfectly fine so please send me an email if you can.<br /><br />Thanks!!<br /><br />Dudley<br /><br />p.s. Found last weekend - a little black sack with a teddy bear in it and a violet helmet with Sesame St. characters on it. Please let me know if you know who they belong to.<br />

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, maybe I am biased because I volunteer there weekly, but I think it&#039;s a <strong>great idea</strong>.&nbsp; We have a lot of regulars (some are the kids of the farmers, some are our own) and we get good games going for the kids.&nbsp; My son loves that when he <strong>finally </strong> rolls out of bed and Sunday morning routine, I&#039;m there at the street and there&#039;s stuff going on.&nbsp; (It&#039;s one of the reasons I work the morning shift ... it helps Luc through the morning shyness if I&#039;m there.)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of times the organizers have had events happening (the smoke house, Bike for New York, music stage, the library).&nbsp; These are a mixed bag, but that&#039;s moire based on the acts/events themselves, not the organizers.&nbsp; (For example, the library thing was great, but at least 6 kids (Luc included) did not get their library cards registered when they filled out the form, and when I went to the library they had noidea there was even a playstreet card drive that had happened, so I imagine the 6 I know are not the only cases.)&nbsp; But even when&#039;s there&#039;s nothing to do, kids seem to enjoy the tables, and just the free space to do what they want.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think <strong>my only wish</strong> is that we had more donations (one paperless week, we were down to painting rocks) and more volunteers (lately I think there are shifts that no one captains).&nbsp; But other than that, I am so glad to be a part of this in my own small way, and I really think the organizers did a great thing here by setting it up.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next week is the last week until the spring, so hopefully we have good weather one more time ...

				The Play Street is simply the greatest thing since babies and cute puppies.<br /><br />That is... much like babies and cute puppies, it provides a means for complete strangers to begin talking with each other.&nbsp; I have spent countless days with my kids in the playground, without ever striking up a conversation with a stranger.&nbsp; But on the Play Street, I have met many people.&nbsp; The conversations always start out about the same (&quot;isn&#039;t this great?&quot;), but then evolve in different directions from there.&nbsp; It has truly become the town square our community has lacked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, weekends are quite busy for my family, and we haven&#039;t made it to the play street for at least six weeks.&nbsp; I volunteered a few times at the beginning of the season, but haven&#039;t been able to make the ongoing commitment I hoped to make.&nbsp; Which brings me to my recommendation.&nbsp; I think the Play Street has demonstrated its feasibility and value, and should be allowed to operate without ongoing volunteer supervision.&nbsp; Beyond set up and clean up, I&#039;d rather see our volunteer energies poured into a few, larger events on the Street (not all necessarily just for kids.... such as a neighborhood cookout, or an occasional stickball game).&nbsp; To make this work, we would need more vocal support from our local elected officials.&nbsp; A high-profile champion could go a long way toward facilitating the cooperation we need from NYPD and DOT.<br />
