					Lilybell, you still don&#039;t get it: spray painting a swastika on a Jewish house of worship is not &quot;vandalism&quot; or &quot;graffiti.&quot;&nbsp; It is a hate crime.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the equivalent of some kid spraying his tag on the roll down gates of a store.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t write some stuff on a lamp post.&nbsp; They committed an act of hate against a segment of our community.&nbsp; And an &quot;impulsive&quot; act, as you describe it, usually doesn&#039;t include locating and disabling a surveillance camera before you commit your crime.<br /><br />You also say that my &quot;reaction is exactly what the vandals wanted.&quot;&nbsp; If outrage is what they wanted, then fine, they got it.&nbsp; What&#039;s your suggestion with respect to the proper reaction?&nbsp; Should I just make believe that this was some trivial act and ignore it?<br /><br />I have been a part of this neighborhood long enough to see hate crimes committed against many groups who make up our diverse community.&nbsp; For me, at least, the proper reaction is for the community to express it&#039;s outrage.&nbsp;

					I&#039;m a little taken aback by what I&#039;m reading: &quot;prank; &quot;I just don&#039;t think it had any true meaning&quot;; &quot;I highly doubt this was an actual hate crime.&quot;&nbsp; There are only two Jewish Synagogues in the community that I know of and the fact one of them had a swastika painted on it is not the result of some accident by kids who didn&#039;t know what they were doing.&nbsp; This patricular house of worship is located off the beaten track.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t even know it exists. THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS SPRAY PAINTED OVER A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA! Does that sound like some kid who didn&#039;t know what he was doing?&nbsp; This was no accident and the symbol used was not randomly chosen. <br /><br />Nor does the fact non-Jewish establishments were also targeted change anything.&nbsp; If an African-American church had the letters &quot;KKK&quot; spray painted on it would we describe it as a prank without any true meaning just because the library received the same treatment?&nbsp; The spray painting of the surveillance camera, the choice of the temple as a target, the use of a symbol that conveys hatred towards Jews, are proof to me that some amount of planning went into this. This was a hate crime.&nbsp; The synagogue was deliberately chosen.&nbsp; The sysmbol of hate was deliberately chosen.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m getting emotional, but contrary to what someone else wrote, hate crimes evoke emotional reactions.<br /><br /><br /><br />&#039;

					I live on 76th Street and I am happy with most of the changes.&nbsp; Our street was constantly backed up and the sound of horns honking filled the air.&nbsp; With the addition of another southbound street, and with the new turning lane which allows traffic to flow even when someone is making a left turn, the quality of life has improved.

					EvaViva, I think your points are lost when you use this coded &quot;race card&quot; language:<br /><br /><em>It might be too &quot;exotic&quot; for some people <br />It might be nice to have everything be white-washed <br />There are plenty of &quot;clean,&quot; gentrified blocks to move to, if needed...<br />if you&#039;re looking for a gentrified block with &quot;controlled exoticness,&quot; </em><br /><br />This seems more designed to put people you disagree with back on their heels than anything else.&nbsp; To me, this is about respect, pure and simple.&nbsp; What I see on 73rd Street isn&#039;t the product of race or ethnicity, it&#039;s the result of people who don&#039;t show any respect for our community.&nbsp; If you live here, you shouldn&#039;t be using our streets as a garbage can.&nbsp; If you are visiting, you shouldn&#039;t be using our streets as a garbage can.&nbsp; And if I criticize the people who treat our community as a garbage dump, it&#039;s not because they are too &quot;exotic&quot; for me, or because I want to &quot;white-wash&quot; the neighborhood, it&#039;s because it&#039;s the right thing to do.<br />

					Rhydewthdis, I think the main point here is that when prostitution encroaches on a residential neighborhood the police have to respond regardless of the race or economic resources of the patrons.&nbsp; More importantly, because of the special prostitution diversion part in Queens Criminal Court, and DA Brown deserves credit for this, every woman who is arrested on Roosevelt Avenue is given a chance to get away from her traffickers and into a safe, alternative programs.&nbsp; Yesterday in court, there were actually three pimps sitting in the audience waiting for their &quot;possessions&quot; to have their cases called so they could grab the women on the way out.&nbsp; On a positive note, there were many young women who were in programs putting their lives back together; one had gone back to high school and just graduated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bottom line, it&#039;s okay with me if the police crack down on this every night on Roosevelt.&nbsp; It would be immoral to just look the other way.<br />

Visit our Synopsis Help to learn more <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />SynopsisEditHistoryDiscuss <br />Very Young Girls is a documentary film that chronicles the journey of young women through the underground world of sexual exploitation in New York City.A 14-year-old girl is lured from her home, beaten, raped, held captive, and sold for sex in New York City. The police find her -- and arrest her. A man who has sex with an underage girl should be prosecuted as a criminal rapist. But there is a loophole: if the child accepts money in exchange for sex, the rapist is now a &quot;john&quot; and rarely is subjected to greater punishment than a fine. For the very same act, the girl is often prosecuted as a prostitute and sent into detention. The average age of entry into prostitution today in the Untied States is 13 years old. The United States government likes to say it leads the world in combating sexual trafficking, and grades other countries on their compliance. If a woman has been brought from the Ukraine to Manhattan and coerced to have sex for money, the US government provides her services under the 2002 Sex Trafficking legislation. She is a victim. But if she is a African-American girl brought to Manhattan from the Bronx, she&#039;s a criminal and she&#039;s going to jail. Our double standard arises partly from myths about prostitution, promoted in the movies, song, and reality TV - girls are empowered sex workers, strung-out crack whores, greedy &quot;hos,&quot; or hookers with hearts of gold. Very Young Girls shows clearly, that with the average age of entry into prostitution in the United States at thirteen, that sexual exploitation is simply a commercial form of child sexual abuse, the effect of which can continue into adulthood and beyond. The film follows the girls in real time, using veritÃ© and intimate interviews with the girls both when they are still working and when in recovery, The film also uses footage shot by pimps themselves that illustrate exactly how it all starts. Very Young Girls tells the story of girls who spend their teenage years being recruited and brainwashed by predatory pimps, bought and sold on the street, sent to jail, and then recovering from the trauma of sexual exploitation. Recovery occurs through Rachel Lloyd, who runs GEMS, the only survivor-led organization in New York that offers services to sexually exploited girls. Rachel rescued herself from sexual exploitation, and she and her staff are relentless in their mission to help girls sent by the courts to GEMS after being arrested, or found on the streets by GEMS staffers, to piece their lives back together in group therapy. But sessions reopen wounds as girls relive memories of the abusive homes they ran away from, pimps who convinced them that they were &quot;in love,&quot; the nightly rapes they endured to make money so their pimp would give them attention instead of a beating; and the fear that they will never be anything but a &quot;ho&quot; in anyone&#039;s eyes - including their own. A few girls will succeed, some will remain suspended on the edge of two worlds, and others will be sucked back into the underground. Very Young Girls will change the way law enforcement, the media, and society as a whole look at sexual exploitation. [D-Man2010]<br /><br />Focuses on the work of a former sexually exploited youth-turned-activist named Rachel Lloyd, who started the New York City organization GEMS (Girls Educational and Mentoring Services) to help victimized young women escape their pimps and make a new start. Some of the teenage girls she works with have been so psychologically manipulated by their pimps that they continue to fall back into old routines. However, some have been able to make a cleaner break with their past.

But so do numerous other permutations of this industry on CL, backpage, and hundreds of other avenues as easily accessible as these cards and at all price points.&nbsp; <br /><br />Totally unclear.&nbsp; How many of these arrests were made in brothels/during the act-of vs men who were caught in vice stings?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing most of these were during vice stings targeting low-income, undocumented immigrants.&nbsp; The numbers would be very similar if you ran the same operation in Murray Hill or Sutton Place on any random night btwn 1-3a when all the mostly non-immigrant, higher income young men stream out of bars after many drinks.&nbsp; <br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, I think law enforcement is skewing the numbers purposefully to these areas because of the large vulnerable immigrant population without adequate access to legal representation.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry, but I think you are way off with your analysis.&nbsp; Part of my job involves efforts to combat human trafficking (tomorrow I will be in Queens criminal court visiting the only prostitution diversion part in the State, many of the prostitutes are teenagers).&nbsp; Prostitution on Roosevelt Avenue is a serious problem.&nbsp; Many of the young women involved in prostitution in our area have been trafficked.&nbsp; In fact, the Roosevelt Avenue corridor and the Queensboro Plaza area are two of the main trafficking sites in the city.&nbsp; To claim that there would be just as many prostitution arrests in Sutton Place is inaccurate and really misses the point.&nbsp; This is not a victimless crime.&nbsp; Young girls are being forced into sexual slavery right here in our neighborhood. If anyone wants to learn more about this problem I would suggest that you see the documentary &quot;Very Young Girls.&quot;&nbsp; It takes place in New York and it is heartbreaking.<br />
