								<div class="inner" id="msg_12028">More hysterical overreactions to the presence of day-laborers in the neighborhood...&nbsp; Very disappointing to see police arresting people based on resident complaints rather than the letter of the law.&nbsp; I wonder if this was motivated in part by <a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1665.0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">yesterday&#039;s article</a>?<br /><br /><br />The New York Times<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22laborers.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Police, Responding to Complaints, Arrest 10 Men at Day Laborer Gathering Place</a><br />By KIRK SEMPLE and AL BAKER<br />Published: October 21, 2008<br /><br />The police arrested 10 immigrants on Tuesday on charges that they blocked a sidewalk at a popular gathering place for day laborers in Jackson Heights, Queens, the chief spokesman of the Police Department said.<br /><br />The arrests came in response to repeated calls from neighborhood residents complaining about the laborers â€”most of them undocumented â€” who congregate every day at the intersection of Broadway, 37th Avenue and 69th Street, said the spokesman, Paul J. Browne.<br /><br />â€œPolice responded to community complaints about them blocking the sidewalk and congregating,â€ Mr. Browne said, adding that there were 50 to 60 workers at the location on Tuesday morning before the arrests.<br /><br />â€œWe responded and asked them to disperse,â€ Mr. Brown said. â€œAll but 10 of them did.â€<br /><br />Several day laborers who were at the intersection on Tuesday afternoon and said they had witnessed the arrests, denied that the police had given the men an opportunity to disperse. The police, they say, pulled up in two vans, demanded identification from a group of workers clustered near the curb, and took those men away.<br /><br />Those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking pedestrian traffic and were taken to a local precinct, where they were being held pending arraignment, Mr. Browne said.<br /><br />They were unable to provide verifiable identification, Mr. Browne said.<br /><br />The arrests shocked day laborers who congregate at the intersection. By Tuesday afternoon, several hours after the arrests, about two dozen had returned to the site. The men, some of whom had been going to the intersection for more than three years, said it was the first time the police had arrested workers there.<br /><br />Indeed, city authorities for years have generally left day laborers alone at the dozens of sites across the city where they gather to wait for work.<br /><br />But the authorities said that Tuesdayâ€™s police action was simply a response to neighborhood complaints and did not represent the start of a crackdown on day laborers.<br /><br />Mr. Browne described the action as â€œa police commander responding to complaintsâ€ from residents about â€œa large group congregating.â€<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_12049">The question is not so&nbsp; much whether or not these people should have been arrested it is more one of why now, all of a sudden. If the police department has been turning a blind eye to undocumented (or for that matter documented) workers lining up for work in various areas of our neighborhood for close to 15 years why all of a sudden are they cracking down ? It&#039;s too coincidental that two officers were shot yesterday by a person who was in this country illegally and suddenly there&#039;s a crack down the very next morning. <br /><br />Last I checked, and I am no lawyer, the constitution grants the right to freedom of assembly. The men assembled at the intersection of 69th St / 37th Ave. / Bway were probably not loitering. This is according to my interpretation (again I am NOT a lawyer) of the city&#039;s Loitering laws, which seem to imply that you must have some form of ill intent like gambling or prostitution to be charged with loitering. You also apparently need to be in or near a school or transportation facility to be charged with loitering.(<a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/bclc/web/NewYork/ny3(b).htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://wings.buffalo.edu/law/bclc/web/NewYork/ny3(b).htm</a>) <br /><br />The fact that it seems like the men assembled there were challenged for their ID prior to being arrested implies to me that the police department knew there was nothing they could charge these men with. If you are challenged&nbsp; for ID by a police officer and you don&#039;t present it you can be detained until the PD can verify your identity. Again, not charged with a crime, just detained. This may also explain why only a small number of people were arrested and not everyone that was there. They were not technically breaking any laws. <br /><br />I am by no means defending cat calls, public urination, or otherwise unsavory behavior. But I do feel that a panic sets in especially when it comes to undocumented immigrants. One negative experience with one person of a particular nationality or skin color can sometimes taint the popular perception of everyone who resembles that nationality or skin color. I&#039;m willing to believe that the vast majority of the men who line up as early as 4am every morning, despite the weather, to hopefully get picked up to work for little, or in some cases, no money are not all urinating, cat calling, etc. <br /><br />The vast majority of these people have left their family and loved ones behind to come here and work extra hard to send money back home. As they try to improve their family&#039;s situation they contribute to our society in ways that are often over looked. We take great pride in our restaurants in Jackson Heights but often forget that the person who cooked that meal, served it to us, or washed the dishes after we were done is quite possibly undocumented. We&#039;re lucky to be able to afford to eat in this neighborhood, but if the eateries here couldn&#039;t rely on the cheaper labor, I&#039;d imagine we&#039;d have less dining choices at a much higher price. If you&#039;ve bought fruit or vegetables at Trade Fair or any other super market chances are some portion of the local produce there has been picked by undocumented hands. If you&#039;ve taken a cab home from the 74th St. station because it&#039;s too late or too cold, and you&#039;re too afraid to walk the streets&nbsp; there&#039;s a decent chance that the person driving that cab is undocumented too. <br /><br />So perhaps the contribution made by undocumented workers out weighs the loss in tax revenue / tax expense to have them here when you think about how much more expensive things might be if they didn&#039;t do the crap work that nobody wants. Certainly the cost to the average tax payer to pay for the police, correctional facilities, and eventual deportation is quite high, as evidenced by the fact that most detention facilities are privately run and enjoy a healthy profit every year. <br /><br />We might be better served as a country to examine how we deal with undocumented workers, and rather than punish skilled and hard workers why not create a system that allows them to contribute in a productive manner, pay their fair share, and not live in fear of being arrested and deported simply for trying to make a better life. <br /><br />That being said, there is no excuse&nbsp; for breaking the law, and the young man from the Dominican Republic who shot those cops should be charged and deported. Many undocumented works live in fear of breaking the law because they are aware of the consequences, no one wants to rock the boat so to speak. The police in our area would better serve the community by focusing on violent crimes and endeavoring to stop the &quot;strange men&quot; who have been following women around the neighborhood. </div>

If the police department has been turning a blind eye to undocumented (or for that matter documented) workers lining up for work in various areas of our neighborhood for close to 15 years why all of a sudden are they cracking down ? It&#039;s too coincidental that two officers were shot yesterday by a person who was in this country illegally and suddenly there&#039;s a crack down the very next morning. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />According to the two NY Times articles (69th St. arrests; Police shooting on subway) there is NO plausible connection, coincidence, or &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; between these two events.&nbsp; Your timeline of events is incorrect - the 69th Street arrests happened first on Tuesday morning/afternoon, and then the subway shooting happened about 5:15PM on Tuesday.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />From the NY Times article, &quot;Police, Responding to Complaints, Arrest 10 Men at Day Laborer Gathering Place&quot; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22laborers.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22laborers.html</a><br /><br /><em>The arrests shocked day laborers who congregate at the intersection. By <strong>Tuesday afternoon, several hours after the arrests</strong>, about two dozen had returned to the site.</em><br /><br />also:<br /><br /><em>A 28-year-old Mexican laborer who would give only his first name, Enrique, said he was standing with the other laborers at the intersection <strong>late Tuesday morning</strong> when the two police vans arrived.</em><br /><br />From the NY Times article on the police shooting at the 21st Street subway station: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22cops.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/nyregion/22cops.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin</a><br /><br /><em>&quot;A man who was being arrested for using a student MetroCard on <strong>Tuesday evening</strong> struggled with two plainclothes police officers in a Queens subway station and then shot them with the gun of one of the officers, the police said.&quot; </em> <br /><br />&quot;<em>Mr. Kelly said the officers, from District 20 of the Transit Bureau, were working under a lieutenantâ€™s supervision in the 21st Street-Queensbridge subway station on the F line in Long Island City, Queens, <strong>when Mr. Nunez arrived at about 5:15 p.m.</strong> and tried to swipe himself through a turnstile with a student MetroCard.</em>&quot; <br /><br />Two <em>unrelated</em> events.&nbsp; The arrests on 69th Street occurred on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; The subway incident occurred at about 5:15PM, also on Tuesday.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was NO crack down the &quot;very next morning&quot; after 2 officers were shot.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the same token, it&#039;s also incorrect to imply the reverse cause/effect relationship - just because illegal immigrants were arrested in the morning, doesn&#039;t necessarily imply that the cops at the 21st Street subway station were shot by an illegal immigrant <em>because</em> of the arrest in the morning.&nbsp; If someone had implied such a connection on these pages, there would probably be a &quot;hysterical overreaction&quot;, and rightfully so.<br /><br />If there&#039;s any &quot;conspiracy&quot; involved in these 2 incidents, one should look at the writers of these 2 NY Times stories.&nbsp; In the 69th Street story - Kirk Semple and <strong>Al Baker</strong>.&nbsp; In the police shooting story - <strong>Al Baker</strong>.&nbsp; Think about it!&nbsp; (That&#039;s meant as a joke!)<br /><br />Now, if anyone still wishes to believe in a coincidence, and the NY Times is part of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, I&#039;ll gladly supply a roll of Reynolds aluminum foil for you to fabricate your very own tin foil hat.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_12058">I logged onto these forums specifically to talk about these events.<br /><br />We got a call in our office yesterday just as the arrests were taking place.&nbsp; We provide educational services for adult immigrants, and we have a variety of support services for our students, and apparently the caller works with both the day labor community and students in our program, and was under the impression that we could help.&nbsp; I put the caller on the phone with our paralegal, our community organizer started contacting some organizations that also work with immigrants to alert them, and I ran down to serve as a witness to the events.<br /><br />As I walked down Roosevelt, several men were walking up into the 70â€™s and warning other groups of men about the arrests.&nbsp; I stopped and spoke with one group who was just learning about the events, and heard the first of many versions.&nbsp; When I arrived near 69th st, there were several groups of men who had returned to the sidewalks hoping for work.&nbsp; While several claimed to have witnessed the events, the stories were quite varied.&nbsp; Some said a dozen men were taken into custody, others said 15, others said 40.&nbsp; Some said there were two vans, others four vans.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Some said the men making the arrests were wearing green, but almost <strong>everyone insisted that they were wearing blue uniforms, and over and over again witnesses insisted that the arrests were conducted by the 108 precinct.</strong>&nbsp; I found that really hard to believe, but that is what everyone was saying.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>And over and over again, witnesses said that the police did not even ask for identification, but just took a group of men and ushered them into vans.&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />It turns out that they were in fact taken to the 108 precinct.&nbsp; When I googled the 108 precinct to see if I could find their phone number, the first link lead me here.&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://nyc.everyblock.com/locations/police-precincts/108/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nyc.everyblock.com/locations/police-precincts/108/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Scroll down to Mondayâ€™s news, which was on the top of the page at that time, and youâ€™ll see an article written by the same reporter on Monday about the plight of day laborers throughout the region, and the corner cited by the writer is where the raid occurred.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I called the reporter up, and he was shocked and angered to hear that his journalism might be linked to these bizarre arrests.&nbsp; He promised to do some research and follow up.&nbsp; I was delighted to see his article today.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />When I called the 108 precinct, the woman who answered the phone confirmed that they were there, but then as I started asking questions, she decided that I did not have a right to that information.&nbsp; <br /><br />The good news is that 4 of them were released last night, but 6 were held overnight, and I assume they were released today.&nbsp; They were never put into Federal custody, which could have lead to deportation.&nbsp; The 4 who were released came to our office today, and I&#039;ll try to provide updates on this forum as more information becomes available.&nbsp; <br /><br />So they were charged with disorderly conduct?&nbsp; For standing on the street?&nbsp; <br /><br />I am outraged.&nbsp; <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_12081">Thanks Aronan and KC for your presentation.&nbsp; I&#039;m 2nd generation IrishAmerican and am quite aware that not all of my family came here legally.&nbsp; Like many others they came here in search of a better life, they settled in even though many thought they should be sent back.&nbsp; They supported schools and churches.&nbsp; Sent sons and daughters into the school system first as students later as teachers; sent others into the police and fire departments; joined unions to better their lives and saw to it that those that came after them had better employment opportunities and faced less discrimination.&nbsp; I hope these recent arrivals do not lose the hope that led them here, turn out to be as lucky as my forebears were; i hope they ignore the xenophobic cat calls hurled their way and persist in going after the American dream.<br />I read a posting on this site that described one family&#039;s efforts to supply a daily meal for this group.&nbsp; Maybe we should be looking at addressing the problems that might arise from a group congregating in a given area rather than asking &quot;future citizens&quot; to move on.&nbsp; </div>
