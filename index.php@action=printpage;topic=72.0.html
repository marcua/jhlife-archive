				Here are some walking tours of Jackson Heights and surrounding areas... great ways to learn about the neighborhood&#039;s food, architecture, and history. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Beautification Group&#039;s Historic Weekend</strong><br />Held every June, the JHBG Historic Weekend includes many ways to explore Jackson Heights, including a self-guided tour of the neighborhood&#039;s private interior gardens, and escorted walking tours of the historic district. &nbsp;See the JHBG website (http://www.jhbg.org/index.html) for more information.<br /><br /><strong>Sunnyside to Jackson Heights</strong><br />Urban geographer Jack Eichenbaum (http://www.geognyc.com) leads two walking tours in the Sunnyside-Jackson Heights area. &nbsp;&quot;The first walk concentrates on inter-war residential and industrial developments with open space. The second walk follows Roosevelt Ave, the #7 elevated train built on its right-of-way, and late twentieth century immigrant commerce.&quot; &nbsp;Schedule information can be found on the Municipal Arts Society (http://www.mas.org/viewcategory.php?category=19) website or through the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment (http://www.bcue.org/?go=cmn.49).<br /><br />Noshwalks: <strong>South Asian Jackson Heights</strong> and <strong>Latin American Jackson Heights</strong><br />Myra Alperson&#039;s Noshwalks provide a great introduction to the delicacies of many NYC neighborhoods. &nbsp;Schedule information can be found on the Noshwalks (http://www.noshwalks.com) website.<br /><br /><strong>The Queens Jazz Trail</strong><br />The Queens Jazz Trail map (http://www.ephemerapress.com/queens.html) provides a self-guided walking tour of the neighborhoods and residences of many great jazz musicians.<br /><br />Are there any others?

				The Institute of Culinary Education offers a 7 train Eating Tour - &quot;Take the Ethnic Eats Express Through Queens&quot;<br />https://web.iceculinary.com/icereg/details.asp?cid=7TRAIN&amp;DT=<br /><br />And the Queens Museum of Art Cultural Trolley Tour goes through Jackson Heights<br />http://queens.about.com/od/neighborhoodtours/a/queens_tours.htm<br /><br /><br />Also, the Queens.about.com site offers a whole list of queens tours - some are JH related and others are not.<br />http://queens.about.com/od/neighborhoodtours/a/queens_tours.htm<br /><br />Last but not least, you could always create your own tour using the &quot;Google map of obscure street food in Eastern Jackson Heights&quot; http://www.chowhound.com/topics/388653 that you mentioned in your other post about street carts.

				<br />Travelvideo.tv<br />Context Walking Seminars Open in New York and London (http://travelvideo.tv/news/more.php?id=13684_0_1_0_M)<br />Feb 26, 08 | 11:28 am<br /><br />Leading walking tour company recruits historians and other scholars to lead â€œwalking seminarsâ€ in New York City and London. NYC launch timed for NY Times Travel Show.<br /><br />London and New York City. â€” Context, the network of scholars who lead critically-acclaimed walking tours in several European cities, announce their expansion to New York City and London. The group will begin organizing walks on a weekly schedule in both cities, as well as privately for individual customers, at the end of February.<br /><br />â€œNew York is a return for us,â€ says Context founder Paul Bennett. â€œI was an architecture journalist here before we moved to Rome and started Context.â€ Under Bennettâ€™s direction, Context New York has developed a series of thematic walks that include several topical walks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a seminar on the archaeology of Manhattan, evening walks of the Chelsea art galleries, and visits to the chocolatiers of Soho. The group will also be offering, in mid-March, a walk on immigration in New York that will focus on the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens and a stroll of Central Park with a landscape historian.<br /><br />As is the case with its work in other cities, all New York walks are led either by a scholar or expert in a relevant field. The thirteen â€œdocentsâ€ comprising Context New York hail from the fields of historic preservation, art history, architecture, cuisine, and archaeology. As with its other cities, group size will be kept small (6 people maximum) in order to maintain an intimate, conversational atmosphere that customers often liken to being in a college seminar class.<br /><br />...<br /><br />To learn more about Context visit its website at: www.contexttravel.com<br /><br /><br /><em>[Follow link at top for complete article]</em>
