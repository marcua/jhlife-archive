			<strong>dotley</strong>:
			<br />
			Late this morning, I saw a large tan dog walking slowly on 85th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Blvd.&nbsp; He appeared to be lost.&nbsp; Had no tags, his ears had been cropped but not his tail.&nbsp; I went around to an open underground garage on 34th Avenue, but the gentleman I spoke to, although very nice, did not know what to do either.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not very educated about dogs, but my guess is that he is a pit bull mix.&nbsp; He looked friendly to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Should I call Animal Control?&nbsp; If someone can help him, I would appreciate it.<br /><br />thanks.
