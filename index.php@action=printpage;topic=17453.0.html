				&nbsp;Saw that. What a strange name. Really no indication of what it is&nbsp; unless it is specializing in serving wings? I’m going to wait until they open for&nbsp; confirmation, but I suspect I may have to make a call into the apostrophe police. Though would any of that stop me from giving the possibility of good wings in the neighborhood a chance?&nbsp; Heck no!

				dss, I hope Wing&#039;s Miller brings folks like you and your partner into the 80s more often to boost our businesses.

				Well, it&#039;s no UFC. But I can stop by on late nights back from the city, since it&#039;s on the way home from the train. I&#039;ve tried the honey mustard sauce and the mild buffalo and both are good. The chicken is not &quot;double fried&quot; as in the Korean style, plus no beer menu. Sides are good to, but again since they&#039;re not Korean there&#039;s no pickled radish side. Sweet potato fries (or yam as it says on the menu) are good, pretty good cole slaw and generic but good house salad. Gonna have to check out the onion rings and panko shrimp sometime....

				my partner, who was especially excited about the opening, raved about the wings i brought home last night on our first trial. and i thought them pretty darn good, too. good texture on the meat (still juicy) and a nice crunch, even after a walk back down to 76th street. we had the hot (a good zing, not a mouth sear) and the garlic pepper, which could have used a tiny bit more garlic, but still had a nice pepper tone.<br /><br />fries were crisp, properly salted, held their warmth for the walk, and the jalapeno poppers seemed house made, judging by their look. also quite good.<br /><br />the nice gent behind the counter said &quot;next month, probably&quot; about delivery, but this is definitely one that&#039;s going into regular rotation. next up, extra hot, and perhaps the nuggets. the clam chowder? maybe not.
