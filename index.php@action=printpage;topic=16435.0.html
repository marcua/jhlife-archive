				My go to place for potted flowers and herbs in years past was Ho&#039;s Florist. My current options that I know of are: Home Depot (quite a walk); the green market (a little pricey); and that little gift shop down near Lockwood that has plants (over priced).<br /><br />Anyone know of other florists nearby that sell a nice selection of herbs and potted flowers? (Something across Roosevelt perhaps?)

				If any plant lovers here are interested in inheriting my Phalaenopsis orchid, let me know. I&#039;m planning to do some long-term traveling at the end of this year/early next year and won&#039;t be able to care for it&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I purchased it from Home Depot last December and re-bloomed it this past winter. The flowers have fallen off and I cut off the spikes, but it just unexpectedly started growing a brand new one. It has thrived an apartment setting, at a window with lots of sunlight and being watered around once a week in the winter and once every two weeks outside of winter. I also have a number of supplies I can provide: pots, medium, stakes, fertilizer, flower clips, pruning shears.

				Verni&#039;s Garden Center. It&#039;s not far. It&#039;s Astoria Blvd, and Hazen St, just next to the Jackson Diner. <br />This is a pretty big shop with outdoor greenhouse, and it&#039;s been around for a long, long time. <br /><br />I went last week, after a trip to Home Depot, and was bummed I though of them second. If you walked from central JH, it would take about 20 minutes. If you drive, it&#039;s tricky, but the best way is to take Ditmars to Hazen, which correlates with about 75th st. http://www.vernisgardencenter.com/aboutus.html<br /><br />He convinced me to buy a smaller amount of landscape fabric than I intended. He was right, too.
