				from JHBG newsletter:<br /><br /><strong>The New Building at 84th Street and 37th Avenue</strong><br /><br />On July 19, 2011 the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) held its final hearing<br />and approved the proposed new building at the northeast corner of 84th Street and 37th<br />Avenue. While many may feel the building is too large, the review process overseen by<br />the LPC since December of last year has resulted in a much improved building. Key<br />to these improvements were the comments and suggestions of the JHBG, Councilmember<br />Daniel Dromm, the Historic Districts Council and other concerned residents.<br /><br />Here is a brief summary of what was accomplished:<br />1. Windows will now be placed on the buildingâ€™s east-facing faÃ§ade, where as the original<br />proposal was simply a blank brick wall<br />2. The 84th Street faÃ§ade is aligned with the adjacent building so that there is room for a<br />front garden.<br />3. The 84th Street residential entrance was set back from the faÃ§ade, like the other residential<br />buildings along 37th Avenue. This allows for a small garden at either side of the entrance.<br />4. The buildingâ€™s details â€“ windows being set back from the faÃ§ade, size and location of the<br />pediments, resolving the residential tower with the one-story of commercial storefronts, etc.<br />â€“ were refined with input from the Commissioners and staff of the LPC.<br />5. The small rear open space was originally raised one flight above grade level, and will now<br />be at grade level.<br />6. The materials being used â€“ brick, cast stone, storefront infill â€“ were scrutinized by the LPC<br />and will be of higher quality than in most construction done without their input.<br /><br />The residential section will be set back from the commercial storefronts along 37th Avenue<br />by about 10 feet, similar to Georgian Hall just west of this site. Unfortunately, the building<br />will still be built along its northern lot line, and block a number or windows in the adjacent<br />apartment building.<br /><br />While we would have liked for this lot to have remained a one story building, the zoning envelope<br />allows for a larger building.<br /><br />As detailed above, a number of significant improvements over the original proposal were realized.<br />They are especially important since we will have to lives alongside this new building for decades to come.

				I&#039;ll wait to see the final result, but these sound like the kind of improvements that will make that building better.&nbsp; Thanks to Danny Dromm, JHBG, district council and others for demanding a more contextual building.<br /><br />

				It looks like the new building is nearing completion on the corner of 84th Street and 37th Avenue. An effort was clearly made to relate to the building across 84th Street. I can&#039;t say that I love it, but it could have been much worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />(https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SyVZU82FhR8/UTPo2BnSczI/AAAAAAAAAqs/UN0T4cQ3KJs/s901/IMAG0217.jpg)<br /><br />This is on the site where a fire destroyed several 1 story buildings a few years back: <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4143.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4143.0)<br /><br />It is unfortunate that some people&#039;s views will be blocked or altered, but it is nice to see that the space for businesses will be returned along 37th Avenue.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some additional discussion on this building: <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=7270.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=7270.0)<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4819.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4819.0)<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5504.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=5504.0)<br /><br />Thanks JHBG and everyone that helped to prevent this building from being a complete disaster!

				I was wondering if this building is to be a rental or a cooperative/ condo? Either way this seems to me to&nbsp; be a big scam. The building should have remained a one story structure. Let&#039;s see who the&nbsp; commercial space is rented to.

				Perhaps. But I don&#039;t think a one storey building would be sustainable. Actually I think the building ir remarkably attractive (given what I was expecting) and I hope that we get some a decent retail upgrade from what surrounds it on 37th.

				Actually, the building looks okay now, but it&#039;s built in the cheapest possible way, despite the assurances of quality control from the LPC, and it will age awfully. Deterioration from the elements has already begun, and you can already see peeling stuff, color seepage from the white elements, etc. It&#039;s just ugly, cheap and awful.

				I think that this building was purposefully burnt down to capitalize on the space. It&#039;s not the first time this has happened in Jackson Heights. I do hope the retail space brings something a bit more up scale to an otherwise dismal shopping area.

				Personally, I am disappointed in a number of things about this building.&nbsp; First, I think the design looks like they went to WalMart and bought it.&nbsp; It is so unoriginal and cheap looking.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cookie cutter of the building across from it.&nbsp; Adds nothing to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Most importantly, I am disappointed that it was approved and feel the Landmarks people let us down by allowing this building.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t they have built something smaller, fewer storeys?&nbsp; Because of its size it will mean more residents thus more congestion on the streets in the hood.&nbsp; It is a rental unit which probably also means they will have more residents per apartment unit and more drain on services.&nbsp; These will not be first choice apartments.&nbsp; This is strictly about getting as much money per square footage.&nbsp; I&#039;m also disappointed because this sets a very bad precedent for 37th Avenue.&nbsp; I can forsee all the sites along 37th Ave. being rezoned for tall buildings.&nbsp; I&#039;m not against tall buildings per se.&nbsp; They can be built along Northern Blvd where there is a wide street and their impact would be minimal.&nbsp; This building is just an example of cowboy zoning.&nbsp; The irony is that all these compromises that the developer agreed to were probably already what they expected anyway.&nbsp; Developers always expect to have to cut back on their plans so they ask for the most and get what they expected all along and then brag that they &quot;compromised.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				As someone who testified at the Landmarks Preservation Commission hearings, along with a number of other concerned residents and Councilmember Dromm, while this building is far from perfect, it is far from the &quot;Queens Crap&quot; (acknowledging the blog) that would have been built without Landmarks protection.&nbsp; I was surprised the LPC approved such an exact copy of a building found just across the street.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t thank they would allow that.&nbsp; And while the materials are not the finest, they are likely better than what would have been used otherwise.&nbsp; All you have to do is drive through Flushing, Elmhurst, Astoria, etc. to see what other developers/builders are using.&nbsp; For those of you concerned about more six-story buildings along 37th Avenue.... you need to contact your elected officials (specifically Dromm and Ferreras) and demand a rezoning of this thoroughfare.&nbsp; ASAP.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m just grateful it doesn&#039;t look like some Flushing or Elmhurst &quot;luxury&quot; condo. I think it looks like it fits in with the neighborhood pretty well and I don&#039;t hink we can expect high-end finishes for a middle class building these days.

				For me, it’s an improvement over the one story taxpayer that was there before, which seemed kind of provisional and ratty looking.&nbsp; <br /><br />Granted that it’s not a distinguished or imaginative design, but it is kind of handsome and solid looking -- the uniformity with the older building across the street doesn’t bother me and I agree it fits in with the neighborhood’s look reasonably well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I actually wouldn’t mind seeing a few more five or six story brick buildings along 37 Avenue built along these lines. <br />

				I have been in contact with Dromm&#039;s office over the past year and he is going to put together a committee of locals to look at rezoning.&nbsp; I was asked to be on the taskforce.&nbsp; His office did say, however, that this is not the best environment to work in.&nbsp; The present Mayor&#039;s office is not keen on rezoning and are very pro-developer.&nbsp; My feeling is there is development and there is &quot;development.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s important we have a say over the character of our neighborhood and not just let market forces rule and define where and how we live.&nbsp; As I said in an earlier post, I have no objection to development along Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Because the blvd is so wide tall buildings would seem less out of place.&nbsp; There is a quality of life issue here.&nbsp; It was because many in our community made noise (old farts? young farts?) that we will have more green space (thanks Danny Dromm.)&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with refocusing development in our community.&nbsp; We live here, the developers don&#039;t.&nbsp;

				Actually from what I&#039;m told, the owners of our retail zone don&#039;t live here either, some don&#039;t even live in this country! It would be nice if we had less predatory leasing and more sustainable development.&nbsp; In my opinion, our retail corrider is nicer than Astoria, beats LIC to heck, and as a former resident of FH, is actually nicer bones-wise than the retail zone in that community. There is no good reason that Jackson Heights isn&#039;t the most vibrant community in Queens, ohter than malign neglect. Someone wants JH to stay the way it is, to bleed it dry (and not to help lower income residents) That&#039;s my theory, I could be wrong.

				One thing I think we can all agree on is maintaining the integrity and quality of life in Jackson Heights. My own approach, and I hope also others, would be to measure things according to the model as set up by Edward MacDougall and his Queensboro Corporation. Of course we have to understand that over the years that vision was compromised and we don&#039;t live in the MacDougall era anymore. But we should try to keep the vision of the model as we progress 100 years later.<br /><br />Clearly 37th Avenue was to be our commercial corridor. Was there any real reason why there was a mix of single story buildings on the avenue alongside of taller ones? Or was it just a matter of what could be afforded at the time? We had this same problem years ago when the building on the avenue between 82nd and 83rd went up. At least this new building attempts to fit the neighborhood. i do think it is odd to just copy the one alongside it. They could have been a little more creative than that but it certainly is better than what was origianlly proposed or the psuedo attempt at 82nd street.<br /><br />As for overcrowding, yes this as a trend will effect the quality of life of life here. That as an issue received its first blow with the post WW2 building boom on top of the golf course. We can&#039;t very well bulldoze all those buildings and start over. But we can keep the original model in mind.<br /><br />With the loss of the golf course open green space disappeared. That is what we really need here most and I&#039;d like to see the Garden School space developed this way. There is only so much space and no more. The neighborhood is about more than the kids, and I&#039;m very sure that kids need green just as well as the adults do.<br /><br />I am delighted that the neighborhood has received landmark status. This of course was a large boom in preserving things. But the neighborhood is about more than the present historic district. Many times I feel that the rest of JH is just a buffer to serve those within the historic district. That as an attitude only serves those who are invested in the district. What would happen if the rest of JH was ruined?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

The reason better retail doesn&#039;t move into the area is because the historic district is a essentially a &quot;dead zone&quot; that is relatively incapable of population growth and only experiences low to moderate population turnover. So the types of businesses that can make it here now are the ones who will remain, and no one should expect any rapid changes to the business landscape. <br /><br />I see the new building at 84th Street as an opportunity for new blood to move into Jackson Heights. Perhaps we should wait and see what develops before we decide that we need to &quot;preserve and protect&quot; all those ugly one-story 99¢ discount stores and hoochie-coochie dress shops along 37th Avenue?

				A bit off the topic but why are so many storefronts emptying out recently? <br /><br />We are new to the neighborhood and have sadly watched as Mehfil Indian restaurant disappeared, as well as the nearest dry cleaners, Rudy Volcano, that little internet cafe-type space (granted it was dumpy), the weird corner store that sold phones and medical equipment, most recently Novo, which personally I liked, and even that Latin dance studio on 75th St on the way to the subway is now empty. The Dime Bank on our corner expanded--why does a bank need that much space? Do I ever see anyone in there? Okay maybe one customer at a time and a lot of empty, pristine desks. <br /><br />Mehfil, which we loved, was replaced by another Indian fast food joint with glaring fluorescent lights and the ubiquitous Coke dispenser in the dining room. I read on one of these forums that the rents are outrageous and the landlords just take the empty spaces as tax deductions and thus don&#039;t care. There are people on this site speculating on what might take Novo&#039;s place, while I am worrying that nothing will. <br /><br />Now that we have been here over a year, and the novelty of 1001 cuisines at bargain prices is beginning to wear off--and even though we like those offerings-- I am starting to feel disgruntled at the lack of certain basic things, like a nice place to have brunch on 37th on a Saturday, or to have a drink with friends. <br /><br />It does seem like there is a strong market for Espresso 77--good quality food and drink, nice setting, a place to meet friends. I love it there--and I also like JuJu&#039;s very much (ever tried their desserts?), though they are open very limited hours.<br /><br />I spent one Saturday with a friend roaming around to find a nice brunch or lunch spot and honestly, after walking the length of 37th and finding nothing, we wound up at Uncle Peter&#039;s on Northern, a bit of a shlep. <br /><br />On 37th, there are downscale, kind of depressing and dumpy coffee shops (nicer lighting and decor and fewer hand-scrawled signs tacked to the windows would work wonders), or places where when you walk in, they have to search to find an employee who speaks English to deal with you. <br /><br />Duo Fratelli seems to have a large Italian menu, not just pizza, yet you eat off plastic trays there on the few crowded tables. Not a pleasant &quot;eating out&quot; experience. <br /><br />We were interested in trying one of the Latino places in the 80s, but they did not seem interested in us. We asked if they had a lunch menu, and after some confusion, they finally muttered something about $19.95, without proffering a menu, so we just moved on. <br /><br />I know I sound like what used to be called a yuppie and will probably be castigated for it, but I don&#039;t understand why there aren&#039;t at least a few more upscale options in a neighborhood that would seem well able to support them. Our neighbors bike into LIC in nice weather to have brunch. There just isn&#039;t anything here. <br /><br />I find myself going to Astoria for certain things, too, like nail salons. The ones around here are either unpleasantly small and crowded, unsanitary-looking, or once again, they have to find an interpreter to deal with a non-Spanish speaking customer. I really wanted to find one I liked here, and I expected to--but was disappointed.<br /><br />I am not that demanding or snobby, either. I used to live in Manhattan, yes, but in Washington Heights, not the Upper West Side.&nbsp; We love so much about Jackson Heights--but I&#039;m beginning to be frustrated about what&#039;s missing, at least for me.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop now--so people can start attacking me for my elitist attitudes!

				leaving aside the multiple pleas to make english the official language of jackson heights&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />the reason they are emptying out is landlord greed.<br /><br />the dry cleaner was asked for a 75 percent hike in an already usurious rent. the medical supply place had their rent doubled. am guessing most of the other departures were caused by similar shakedowns.<br /><br />p.s. for a nail salon, try spa bellagio on roosevelt. extremely clean, lovely people, good services, including a facialist who does speak english, albeit with an accent, if that&#039;s okay.

				that could very well be.<br /><br />i mean, the dry cleaner was paying 4500 per month for that sliver of space before the requested hike. i can&#039;t imagine how any business could pay 7000-plus and turn a profit in that square footage.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=6934.msg47820.html#msg47820">Quote from: JIF on March 08, 2013, 01:03:09 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The only way I can see... to overcome greedy landlords who are determined to keep stores empty... in order to claim maximum tax deduction losses...is to close that loophole in the tax system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I imagine the landlords are advised by their accountants...who must have stumbled onto this trick...which is somewhat like the corporate cowboys who would buy companies and dismantle them by selling off assets at a profit...creating unemployment and destroying communities in the process...<br /><br />In our community...in the case of the dry cleaner... the store is more profitable as a tax loss to the landlord...of 7000/month... compared with a taxable income of 4500/month.<br /><br />And the community loses a dry cleaner (etc)...which is, of course, irrelevant and of no importance to the landlord.<br /><br />Maybe there needs to be the threat of an AUDIT of the landlords...which might frighten them back to fairness.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				That&#039;s a great question joopy86. Maybe these landlords are just hoping for a buyout at some point when the market turns...or that a bank will buy the property and open yet another branch.

				The situation in JH is unique because a handful of absent&nbsp; landlords own all the blocks of stores in our neighborhood....along 37th Ave...in other neighborhoods there is no such monopoly... and so market rental rates apply.

				I was thinking more about this issue.&nbsp; I am also a relatively recent transplant to JH.<br />. When I looked here I was amazed at the spacious and elegant affordable apartments. With gardens to boot! Incredible value housing stock for New York. So I took the plunge.<br /><br />It seemed to me that 37th Ave could easily have the potential to be a Smith Street or Court St in B&#039;lyn.<br /><br />Now I know that is quite unlikely...due to the situation with the commercial district landlords..no astute businessman in his right mind would open here with the exorbidant rents. <br /><br />So I accept that if the commercial situation were different I wouldn&#039;t have been able to afford my apartment.&nbsp; Apartment prices would also be higher. The second rate retail keeps the district affordable. <br /><br />So in a way...it is both good for affordabilty for average income folks...and also bad for speculating...I have decided to love JH for what it does offer. And am happy to go to Manhattan or B&#039;lyn...the transport is so good to JH...for what JH doesn&#039;t...and probably might never have.

				thank you for the well considered post.<br /><br />not venturing a guess as to your economic background, or that of anyone else here, but mine is such that jackson heights -- as it stands now -- is far nicer than anyplace i&#039;ve lived in my life (greenpoint as a kid, 40 years before hipsters found it, lower east side 1981-85, bed stuy, flatbush, astoria in &#039;88 or so).<br /><br />the thing some people don&#039;t realize -- and you seem to get -- is that 99 cent stores and the like are a necessity for many of our neighbors. a lot of people have to take a long subway ride in order to eat cheap mexican food on roosevelt and do so happily.<br /><br />and, for me, the draw was, and is, the quality and price of our actual homes. seriously, a 1200 square foot art deco apartment with original details, 20 minutes from manhattan for about 80 percent less than a similar place, a similar distance away, in brooklyn? c&#039;mon, i spend more time at home than i do in any bar -- and have done so for the past quarter century.<br /><br />again, thanks for the post. i don&#039;t think JH is perfect. but having lived in many nyc &#039;hoods over my 47 years of life, i&#039;ll rank it at the top.

				Two&nbsp; points that I have missed on the conversation:<br />1)Jackson Heights increased population and the lack of any insight into the overcrowding of the trains into Manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;Commuting is already a nightmare, how are the politicians going to address the fact that adding more to the commuting population into Manhattan?<br />2) Investors- so it looks like this was paid for by Chinese banks ( as per the signs).

				3 occupants per apartment, of course, fwould not make such an impact.&nbsp; I assume, however, because they are rentals many will have 5 or more per apartment.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not the real issue.&nbsp; This sets a precedent for the rest of 37th.&nbsp; I can foresee when all the one &amp; two storey buildings along the avenue will be replaced by much too tall buildings.&nbsp; There is the thought that bigger is better and that big means there will be more upscale businesses.&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t necessarily happen.&nbsp; I suspect we&#039;ll have another chain store (bank, cellphone or pharmacy) as a tenant on street level. I don&#039;t think this building will, in any appreciable way, change much in the neighborhood other than adding another tall building along 37th something I&#039;m personally not a fan of.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				A lot of the credit for the building’s good features are the work of JHBG’s Dan Karatzas, who&nbsp; stayed on top of the design and fought to get the good features noted in the JHBG Views article. <br /><br />Size of the building is determined by zoning. The landlord is building what he can. If you don’t like the result, then you better get rid of the market system, even a regulated market system.<br /><br />The building is a lot better than the tear downs and cheap replacements put up off the Avenue on 86th Street and elsewhere before landmarking. And as someone said, much better than the monstrosities that have gone up in Forest Hills.&nbsp;
