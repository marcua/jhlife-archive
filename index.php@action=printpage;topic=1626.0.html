				<strong>Shelby2, you are right on the money.&nbsp; If anyone is selling a Coop you should know that no FHA loans are available at this time for Coops and no bank will finance a coop without 2007 financials (Chase is the exception with a letter and....)<br /><br />If the financials are not available I wouldn&#039;t even put it on the market until you do because it will kill the deal. &nbsp;Another thing to look for is to see if 10% or more of shareholders are late or defaulting on their maintenance, this will also worry the lenders.&nbsp; &nbsp;I deal in all levels of Coops from renovation to sponsor sales and I have seeing 1 out of 3 deals die in the last few months. &nbsp;If you are a seller and have not signed an agreement with a broker and don&#039;t wish to you can do an open listing and give it to a few people in the neighborhood, but they will need this info in this market so they can answer all questions that may arise. &nbsp;If you don&#039;t know any of these answers it will delay your sale. &nbsp;If you get a savvy buyer than I recommend you know every answer plus know the underlying mortgage and comparables as well. &nbsp;Shoot me an email if you need help.<br /><br />Be well and Good Luck!</strong>
