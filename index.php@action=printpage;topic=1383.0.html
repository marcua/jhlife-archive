				The other night, after a really stressful workday, I picked the baby up at daycare and arrived home, ready to collapse, only to find out my neighbor across the hall had had a day that was worse then mine.&nbsp; At 5:30 in the evening there were men tearing apart her bathroom.&nbsp; The original art deco tiles that she loves were replaced by three gaping holes, and they still hadnâ€™t found the source of the leak that was plaguing the downstairs neighbors, and they were starting to tear apart a large section of the floor.&nbsp; <br /><br />I invited her over, to get her out of the chaos, and she asked if I had a glass of wine.&nbsp; I didnâ€™t.&nbsp; &nbsp;:embarassed:&nbsp; I asked if she wanted to take a walk to the store with me, but neither of us had the energy.&nbsp; We collapsed on the couch, turned on Sesame Street, and tried to keep the baby entertained while we both complained about our bad days.<br /><br />Then I got a brainstorm.&nbsp; Tomo!!!!&nbsp; They even deliver wine.&nbsp; Want Japanese?&nbsp; Absolutely!!!!<br /><br />So I go to the phone and call.&nbsp; The woman who answers the phone says something incomprehensible.&nbsp; I hold a moment, and then say â€œhello?â€ again.&nbsp; She admonishes me, and states that her computer isnâ€™t working.&nbsp; For a full four minutes I listened to her making frustrated noises as she tried to get her computer working.&nbsp; Her stress was clearly high too, and she was sharing it with me.&nbsp; Finally, with no apology, she was able to take my order.<br /><br />After a while, the doorbell rang, and the food arrived.&nbsp; I washed the babyâ€™s hands and put on a bib and put her in her highchair, and started unpacking the food.&nbsp; My neighbor had ordered chicken tempura, but they sent over chicken teriyaki instead.&nbsp; The neighbor said that was fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I was mixing some rice in the miso soup for the baby, the plumber from across the hall knocked on the door and my neighbor had to go tend to the issues at hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />I set the baby up to eat her rice and miso soup, and took out the California Maki I had been looking forward to.&nbsp; As per my request, I got extra wasabi.&nbsp; <br /><br />Soy sauce?&nbsp; Soy sauce? Hmmmmâ€¦.. No soy sauce.&nbsp; Let me check the fridge.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; Not even any soy sauce in the fridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />No honey.&nbsp; Donâ€™t splash the soup.&nbsp; Here, let me clean that up.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me call the restaurant.&nbsp; Juice?&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me pour you some juice.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I just ordered a delivery and there is no soy sauce.<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œAre you sure there is no soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes, Iâ€™m sure.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell please check again.â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œIâ€™ve checked again.&nbsp; There is no soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do about it?â€&nbsp; <br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œWell, I just ordered some California Maki, and I canâ€™t eat it without soy sauce.â€<br /><br />I look over and notice that the baby is waving the bowl of soup in one hand, preparing to toss it across the room to indicate that 1) she has had enough soup, and 2) that she is irritated that no one is paying attention to her.&nbsp; I rescue the soup, tuck the phone between my chin and shoulder, and take her out of her highchair.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (Sarcastically)&nbsp; â€œWell donâ€™t you HAVE any soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œNo.&nbsp; I donâ€™t have any soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (With continued sarcasm)&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do?&nbsp; Send a delivery over with soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes.&nbsp; That would be fine.â€<br /><br />Take the baby back into the living room and turn on Dora.<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œYou want me to SEND A DELIVERY OVER WITH SOY SAUCE?????â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; (About to explode) I JUST ORDERED A MEAL THAT I CANâ€™T EAT!!!&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; Iâ€™ve had a very stressful day.â€&nbsp; And I told her a bit about MY stress, given that she had taken quite a bit of my time earlier making me listen to frustrations and computer problems.&nbsp; â€œSo yes, I would like you to send a delivery over with soy sauce.â€<br /><br />She sighs in frustration, since I am clearly a problematic customer, and agrees to send a delivery.<br /><br />At which point my neighbor comes back, and I realize that in my soy sauce crisis, I had completely forgotten that they had gotten her order wrong, and that since they were sending over another delivery, I should have gotten her the chicken tempura that she had ordered.<br /><br />I know that Tomo has gotten a lot of praise on this forum.&nbsp; But Iâ€™ve gotta tell you.&nbsp; I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be ordering up from them again.&nbsp; <br />

				Were I in that situation, I would have been very frustrated, but I would acknowledge that mistakes happen and that Tomo is entitled to a bad day as much as I am. I might have asked for some sort of compensation like a discount on my next order, which would allow me to test the Tomo waters again without paying full price, but I wouldnâ€™t have had them return solely to hand me soy sauce. I would have walked to a convenient market (because after all, this is Jackson Heights) and gotten some. I hope the delivery guy got a huge tip, because he would otherwise make no extra money for the extra trip when he was not likely responsible for the missing sauce in the first place, just like he was not responsible for your childâ€™s being cranky that day, the supposed excuse for his making two trips for the gratuity of one.

This would seem like a reason to frequent Tomo rather than boycott them based on an anecdote.<br /><br />The idea that â€œThe customer is always right!â€ is patent nonsense and degrades customer relations and employee morale. I urge you to read Alexander Kjerulf, â€œTop 5 reasons why â€˜The Customer Is Always Rightâ€™ is wrong (http://www.positivesharing.com/2006/07/why-the-customer-is-always-right-results-in-bad-customer-service/),â€ <em>Chief Happiness Officer</em>, 12 July 2006.

It makes employees unhappy<br />2. It gives abrasive customers an unfair advantage<br />3. Some customers are bad for business<br />4. It results in <em>worse</em> customer service<br />5. Some customers are just plain wrong<br /><br />I have never met KC, let alone was I present when her food arrived, so I am neither stating nor implying she was an abrasive or abusive customer, but I acknowledge I have made many mistakes in my life so I would forgive Tomo their minor errors so long as they werenâ€™t repetitive, and I would never try to punish them for things for which they have not the slightest responsibility (i.e., a childâ€™s misbehaving = not any restaurantâ€™s fault or responsibility).

That said, I would give them another shot and see how the next order goes.&nbsp; If on the next try you continue to experience poor customer service, then I would avoid ordering from Tomo again.&nbsp; The fact that they ultimately did deliver the soy sauce can be taken as an indication that they were willing to please, if at least a bit on that day.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know what others have experienced when ordering delivery from Tomo.

				I had a bad service experience inside of Tomo.&nbsp; I went there with a relative and we ordered and ate, it was pretty good (not great) so we ordered another roll, the roll came up for the waitress to bring.&nbsp; She ignored it for a very long time, we waited and waited and waited while our food was just sitting there.&nbsp; Finally the waitress brought it over, I asked the waitress (nicely) why she waited so long, she snapped out a rude reply.<br />Never going back.

				As someone who has worked in JH for almost 19 years, and lived here 14 or 15 years, Iâ€™ve seen lots of businesses thrive, and lots of businesses fail.&nbsp; It seems that there are two primary characteristics that contribute to success.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first characteristic is filling a niche or specific need in the community.&nbsp; And Tomo clearly does that.&nbsp; I canâ€™t remember a single neighborhood establishment that was so anticipated.&nbsp; And many of my friends and neighbors LOVE Tomo.<br /><br />The second characteristic is providing outstanding customer service.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve waxed poetic on other threads in this forum about the fact that just about every storefront in this neighborhood is a familyâ€™s dream.&nbsp; One of the things that I love about this community is the fact that most businesses here in fact treat you as if you have just walked into their familyâ€™s dream.&nbsp; Maybe Iâ€™m spoiled working/living here so long, but I really expect excellent customer service, and Iâ€™m surprised/disappointed when I donâ€™t get it. <br /><br />The Tomo experience last week really did surprise/disappoint me.&nbsp; Do I want to destroy them?&nbsp; Organize a boycott?&nbsp; My goodness, no.&nbsp; Just surprised and disappointed.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As a middle aged, single, first time mom, who works fulltime and who is in the process of mourning my motherâ€™s sudden death last year, (and also in the process of being the executrix of her out-of-state willâ€¦ AND in the process of finalizing my daughterâ€™s adoption and dealing with social workers and lawyers and whatnot), I find the one thing most valuable to me is time.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I decide to order a delivery, it is a self-indulgent decision which means that I am too tired or too wiped out or too busy to cook, or even to wash my face and put shoes on the kid and head out to a restaurant.&nbsp; I am making the decision to pay the price of eating in a restaurant without taking up space in what is now a really high-rent district.&nbsp; I expect, in return, to have a really really easy meal, with no effort on my part.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is not what I got.&nbsp; So I vented here.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\<br />

Every time I go to La Flor, I try to&nbsp; talk Viktor into moving to Jackson Heights. His take on it ( and admittedly he has a very strong following where he&#039;s located now) is that our neighborhood is such a family oriented neighborhood that restaurant attendance is strong only on weekends (he&#039;s not interested in doing take out). That is coupled with some ludicrously high rents for commercial space along 37th Ave. <br /><br />

				KC sorry to hear about your bad experience with tomo.&nbsp; I ordered once and they were fast and the order was fine.&nbsp; I also never had a problem eating in.<br /><br />I think everyone can have a bad day: waitress, delivery guy, single mom etc.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;d use just one bad experience to color my opinion.&nbsp; Unless it was a horrible experience, and for me that means finding something disgusting in my food, I&#039;d give it one more chance.&nbsp; If they screw up again... bye bye.

Hmmmmâ€¦.. No soy sauce.&nbsp; Let me check the fridge.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; Not even any soy sauce in the fridge.&nbsp; <br /><br />No honey.&nbsp; Donâ€™t splash the soup.&nbsp; Here, let me clean that up.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me call the restaurant.&nbsp; Juice?&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Let me pour you some juice.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I just ordered a delivery and there is no soy sauce.<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œAre you sure there is no soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes, Iâ€™m sure.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell please check again.â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œIâ€™ve checked again.&nbsp; There is no soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do about it?â€&nbsp; <br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œWell, I just ordered some California Maki, and I canâ€™t eat it without soy sauce.â€<br /><br />I look over and notice that the baby is waving the bowl of soup in one hand, preparing to toss it across the room to indicate that 1) she has had enough soup, and 2) that she is irritated that no one is paying attention to her.&nbsp; I rescue the soup, tuck the phone between my chin and shoulder, and take her out of her highchair.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (Sarcastically)&nbsp; â€œWell donâ€™t you HAVE any soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œNo.&nbsp; I donâ€™t have any soy sauce.â€<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; (With continued sarcasm)&nbsp; â€œWell what do you want me to do?&nbsp; Send a delivery over with soy sauce?â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; â€œYes.&nbsp; That would be fine.â€<br /><br />Take the baby back into the living room and turn on Dora.<br /><br />Her:&nbsp; â€œYou want me to SEND A DELIVERY OVER WITH SOY SAUCE?????â€<br /><br />Me:&nbsp; (About to explode) I JUST ORDERED A MEAL THAT I CANâ€™T EAT!!!&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; Iâ€™ve had a very stressful day.â€&nbsp; And I told her a bit about MY stress, given that she had taken quite a bit of my time earlier making me listen to frustrations and computer problems.&nbsp; â€œSo yes, I would like you to send a delivery over with soy sauce.â€<br /><br />She sighs in frustration, since I am clearly a problematic customer, and agrees to send a delivery.<br /><br />At which point my neighbor comes back, and I realize that in my soy sauce crisis, I had completely forgotten that they had gotten her order wrong, and that since they were sending over another delivery, I should have gotten her the chicken tempura that she had ordered.<br /><br />I know that Tomo has gotten a lot of praise on this forum.&nbsp; But Iâ€™ve gotta tell you.&nbsp; I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be ordering up from them again.&nbsp; <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just to let you know.... the ppl there aren&#039;t actually japanese.&nbsp; They&#039;re fukinese...

				But isn&#039;t the issue here not the missing soy sauce or even the messed up order, but the attitude of the person at Tomo on the phone ? <br /><br />Even if / when the customer is wrong you still don&#039;t treat them in a sarcastic and snippy manner.&nbsp; When you work in a service industry the customer may not always be right, but they are always the one paying. It&#039;s not good business to be snippy and sarcastic to your customers, eventually they won&#039;t come back. <br /><br />Even if the request for a packet or two of soy sauce to be delivered was unreasonable (which I&#039;m inclined to think it was) in the eye of the Tomo person, the answer was not to be rude about it. As I see it there were two viable options:<br /><br />1) &quot;I&#039;m sorry but we can&#039;t send our delivery person out for such a small item, however, please come into the restaurant int he next week and I will be happy to give a you a free roll, desert, what have you to make up for our over sight.&quot; <br /><br />2) &quot;I&#039;m sorry, We can&#039;t send our delivery person out right now, but I will have him stop by your apt. on his way to&nbsp; his next delivery which I anticipate happening in the next X minutes&quot; Then send along a certificate for 10% or 20% the next order as an apology. <br /><br />I&#039;m wiling to bet that if Ms.Tomo were nice from the first interaction and simply apologized for her computer problems this wouldn&#039;t have escalated&nbsp; in the way that I did. <br /><br />Sorry If I&#039;m jumping on a thread that&#039;s been beaten to death here, but I can understand how frustrating it is when people who are preparing food or even something as simple as coffee simply don&#039;t listen and give you the wrong things. It&#039;s careless, and in some instances makes it impossible for the person who just paid money for something unable to eat it. For example as a vegetarian I get really upset when I get an egg and Cheese on a croissant, hop on the subway and find a chunk of bacon or sausage in there that I definitely did not ask for. <br /><br />Yes, mistakes happen and we must take things in stride, but there&#039;s no excuse for carelessness.
