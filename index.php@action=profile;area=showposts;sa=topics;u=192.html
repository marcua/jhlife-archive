					Does anyone know of any bike shops in the area that rent bikes by the day or hour?&nbsp; I have a bike and like to ride around the neighborhood whenever I can.&nbsp; My girlfriend lives in Manhattan but stays with me a lot on the weekends, and she doesn&#039;t have a bike.&nbsp; If I want to go for a ride, it sucks because she can&#039;t go (which means I can&#039;t go haha).&nbsp; I don&#039;t think she&#039;d use one enough to warrant buying a new one, but renting one every once in a while would be great.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!

					Hey everyone.&nbsp; I have a great Kenwood stereo receiver that has stopped working.&nbsp; It turns on, all the buttons work, but there is no sound coming out of my speakers.&nbsp; I tried another set of speakers that I know work and those didn&#039;t work as well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried different cables, and anything else I can think of, but I can&#039;t get it to produce sound.&nbsp; The receiver looks great and is in great condition, but it&#039;s a giant doorstop unless I can get it fixed.&nbsp; Anyone know how to fix it or somewhere I could take it?&nbsp; Thanks!

					Just an FYI to everyone... Monday night I walked out of Home Depot on Northern Blvd around 6 PM and the back window of my car had been smashed out.&nbsp; I only had a small soft sided cooler in my backseat that someone must have thought looked extremely valuable, but unfortunately for them it was empty.&nbsp; I then walked back inside to alert the store manager and she told me that mine was the 3rd car broken into that day.&nbsp; I was parked 3 spots from the front door, and I could visually see the &quot;security&quot; officer standing 50 ft away at the entrance to the store.&nbsp; To add to the frustration, evidently the city owns the parking lot, so any cameras in the lot can only be viewed by a police officer.&nbsp; When the police came, it was pouring rain, and the officer seemed really annoyed about having to deal with filling out the paperwork.&nbsp; She didn&#039;t want to go look at the video and told me to call today for the report number.&nbsp; So, save yourself the trouble and DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING VISIBLE IN YOUR CAR IN THE PARKING LOT.&nbsp; It will prevent a lot of headaches, because neither Home Depot or the police are going to help you out.&nbsp; I hope this helps everyone here out.

					I decided to post this in a different thread because I&#039;ve found a lot of conflicting info on this specific subject alone.&nbsp; To the people that have had their bathrooms remodeled... how difficult was the floor to do?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the normal small pink and blue tiles and the grout around them is crumbling and the tiles are loose.&nbsp; Last night I pulled some up and discovered that I could basically demo the whole floor with my bare hands!&nbsp; Its crumbling all around very easily.<br /><br />After a lot of research, I found (at least I think so) that this material is gypcrete.&nbsp; All the info i have seen says to remove it and start over.&nbsp; This is where my question comes in...<br /><br />If you remove the gypcrete, vacuum, and clean the area, there is a metal mesh at the bottom.&nbsp; The floor is also not level with small humps, and is about 1.5 inches shorter.&nbsp; How have you or your contractors gone about laying a new floor?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m trying to figure this out before I either attempt it myself or hire someone to do it.&nbsp; In my mind it makes sense to pour on a floor leveling compund, then thinset, then screw down the hardie backerboard, and then more thinset and tile.&nbsp; There are a lot of opinions on this on the interwebs, so i wanted to see what some locals have seen on their own projects.<br /><br />If this is totally wrong, or right, i&#039;d love it if someone could let me know.&nbsp; Thanks guys!

					Hey guys and gals... <br />I have a very strong, metal metro shelving unit with several shelves and racking to hang items.&nbsp; It is in perfect condition and is virtually indestructible.&nbsp; Really good for someone that doesn&#039;t have any counters in their kitchen.&nbsp; I have a large piece of marble that fits right on top of it that i used for years as my countertop.&nbsp; I can sell the metroshelving unit for $100, and the marble top for $120.&nbsp; I&#039;m negotiable if you want both.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also have a racheting reclining la-z-boy rocker in good shape.&nbsp; It has leather and upholstery covering.&nbsp; There is a small rip from my movers, but other than that, it&#039;s a great chair.&nbsp; In fact, my friends are gonna be really angry when i get rid of it because they&#039;re always fighting over who gets to sit there!&nbsp; I just got a new one, and thats why i&#039;m selling it.&nbsp; The back is removable for easy transport.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t very heavy either.&nbsp; I&#039;m selling this for $150.&nbsp; My new one just cost me $1100, so I think that&#039;s pretty fair, considering it&#039;s very comfortable and in pretty good shape.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like I said, everything is in good shape.&nbsp; The metroshelves come apart, but are still heavy.&nbsp; I can help you carry the pieces down.&nbsp; I can also help with the chair, eventhough it&#039;s not too heavy.&nbsp; My building has an elevator which makes it easy. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in either or both of the pieces, send me an email at <a href="mailto:py180@hotmail.com" class="bbc_email">py180@hotmail.com</a> or call me at (347)255-7268.&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides going to the gym, I should be available most of the day saturday or sunday for you to check it out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve attached a pic of the shelves, but I still need to take a pic of the chair.&nbsp; Thanks, and I hope to hear from you!<br />Joe<br />

					Hello everyone.&nbsp; My girlfriend has 2 cats that are not declawed, and she hasn&#039;t trimmed their claws in a long time because they aren&#039;t the easiest cats to deal with.&nbsp; We got them claw caps so they don&#039;t tear up my leather couch.&nbsp; Has anyone had experience with these?&nbsp; I know we have to trim their claws before we put them on, so can anyone recommend a reasonable groomer or vet in the area to do this?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have experience with cats, so I&#039;m not really sure how difficult this will be.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!

					Ok, so this morning (and many mornings like it) I drive to work, and often times I get stuck behind a school bus stopped on 34th ave.&nbsp; Today we all patiently waited for 12 minutes before a kid emerged from a building and boarded the bus.&nbsp; Is it just me, or is that crazy!&nbsp; When I was growing up, you had to be out waiting for the bus, because if you weren&#039;t there, the bus would do a halfway rolling stop, and then move swiftly along.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s different in this neighborhood and someone can enlighten me as to why buses are allowed to block traffic on the narrowest streets in the city waiting for kids who only have to walk 15 feet from their front doors to catch it.&nbsp; I have no problem stopping when the red lights are flashing and the kids are getting on.&nbsp; But, there is no reason why the bus should be waiting there for 12 minutes holding up everyone who has to get to work, and have no way of going around it.&nbsp; Needless to say, I am a bit frustrated. :tickedoff:

					Hey guys, I need some help.&nbsp; I recently bought a coop up in Southridge Sect. 3 and am looking to do some kitchen renovations.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a friend who is a licensed contractor who&#039;s doing the work, but there is one major stumbling point.&nbsp; There is a large wall in between my galley style kitchen and living room where i&#039;m looking to punch a hole through and make a 5 ft long pass thru/ breakfast bar.&nbsp; He was here this weekend looking a it, and we can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s a load bearing wall.&nbsp; If I could find the building blueprints, I could find this out easily, and if not, he said I might need to hire a structural engineer to come look at it.&nbsp; I&#039;d much rather opt for the first option, so if anyone has some suggestions, it&#039;d be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!
