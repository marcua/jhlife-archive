				<br />I look forward to seeing this exhibit, but as lalochezia said, this is ironic, as the people who will come to view this, are more often than not gentrifiers/hipsters. I&#039;ve lived in this neighborhood for 10 years, and as much as I am intrigued, and drawn towards ethnic communities, as a single, white women, I still feel like an outsider often, as nearly everything here is geared towards specific ethnic communities &amp; families. I would like to have this conversation with that artist. This is in no way a gentrified neighborhood. Case in point, when friends visit me , who are unfamiliar with this neighborhood, they are all impressed at how it has not been gentrified(because of all the beautiful co ops). As a friend recently said to me &#039;your neighborhood does not pretend to be anything more than what it is&#039; And he meant it as a compliment.<br />I do not feel guilty at all for wanting just a few restaurants that Astoria/LIC has. And I never want the ethnic communities to leave, but why can&#039;t we strike a balance? I think that would be beautiful.<br />In my 10 years here, the landscapes of 37 ave, Roosevelt , and Northern have barely changed, in regards to the types of shops &amp; restaurants. But as we all know, what has changed are the rising real estate prices.

Gentrification can happen almost anywhere, but for a neighborhood to go through a &quot;cool + arty&quot; phrase, it has to be cheap enough for poor artists to live there, and have commercial spaces available for low rents so people can open coffee shops and dive bars and odd little stores—which will be replaced by hip, slightly more upscale restaurants and shops, which before long will be pushed out by places paying the kind of commercial rents already being charged in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; ::)<br />

The anxiety over &#039;gentrification&#039; is not just about people feeling like they&#039;re being pushed out of their neighborhoods (and having to disrupt social connections, school assignments, routines, etc): it&#039;s about the people who are pushed out feeling like they have fewer and fewer options of places to move, like everywhere in NYC is becoming unaffordable. NYC and other cities are seeing a proliferation of low-wage service jobs, but a lack of new housing which people who have those jobs can afford. Meanwhile, NYC&#039;s status as a locus of global capital means that the elite will continue to buy apartments, while the people who serve them have nowhere to go (or just have to spend so much of their income on rent that they&#039;re barely surviving.) That is, if those elite property-owners even reside in their apartments; many luxury apartments in Manhattan and Flushing are kept empty, as they&#039;re basically safety-deposit boxes for foreign money, and therefore they suck the life out of neighborhoods.
