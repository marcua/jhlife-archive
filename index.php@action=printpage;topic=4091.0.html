				We had a hawk today, definitely hunting, in the area of 90th Street Park (between Northern Blvd. &amp; 32nd Ave.) It flew from tree to tree, very low. Beautiful. They&#039;ve been around, on and off, for the past few years.

				You might be right; I&#039;m no birding expert. But, I got a real up close view of the big guy (or gal) today and, after checking out some photos on line, think it might have been a Cooper Hawk. As for its feeding habits, we&#039;ve got soooo many squirrels, starlings and mourning doves around here, they could eat real well.....not that I&#039;m looking for the streets to be filled with blood and guts.........&nbsp; (the big complaint from the Upper West Side with Pale Male and Lola.)

				We saw the bird today at Playground ninety. After looking at your pictures, I&#039;d say it was a red-tail hawk. (the 2nd picture) It was truly stunning, especially as it flew from post to post. It had quite a wingspan! We tried to snap a photo, but only had a crappy camera phone.

				While not a bird of prey, I was surprised to spot a raccoon on 85th street the other night.&nbsp; I was able to get pretty close.&nbsp; <br />Poor guy hobbled around on 3 legs as one leg was either deformed or injured.<br />

				As for the bird, I don&#039;t think it was a kestrel. The bird I saw had a wingspan which I would say was 2 1/2 feet. My husband thought the wingspan was even broader than that.

				before i lived in my current residence, my significant other and i owned one of those spanish-styled houses on 75th -- one of the ones with the roof porch above the third floor. the hawks didn&#039;t nest there, but did use it as a base at times. we&#039;d have to clean up animal parts all the time. mostly squirrel tails, which i guess are not worth eating. they were so so beautiful, that was a small trade off.

				Even the small hawks can reach pretty amazing velocity.&nbsp; One Christmas morning I was in my brother&#039;s house in MA when I heard a loud crash.&nbsp; A Sharp-Shinned Hawk, which is about pigeon size only thinner, had crashed through <span class="bbc_u">two</span> panes of window that were &quot;separated by about 3&quot; and landed in the living room.&nbsp; The glass from the windows was shattered so forcefully that is spread all the way into the dining room, at least 15 feet away.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t believe that happened!&nbsp; The hawk just had a cut on one of its shoulders.&nbsp; It was treated at a wildlife rehab. place and released.

				I have yet to see our local raptors, but have enjoyed them most of my life.&nbsp; I am from Louisiana and every winter we got a lot of hawks migrating through.&nbsp; I have seen two kills, one in my backyard of a&nbsp; dove.&nbsp; <br /><br />The British School of Falcon in Manchester VT offers a class in falconry, using Harris Hawks.&nbsp; I took one class and it was great.&nbsp; I got to fly a hawk and then we went on a woods walk where the hawk follows along thru the trees.&nbsp; Each person has his own hawk.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Price was reasonable, I thought, considering how unusual this is.&nbsp; There is the Equinox resort that is related to it, which is a fine old resort, but you can stay in a cheaper place, or just make it a day trip.&nbsp; Driving time about 3 hours.<br /><br />Cajunnewyorker
