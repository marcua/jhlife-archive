			I&#039;ve been shopping in the stationary store for yrs-especially when I don&#039;t feel like trekking to michaels or staples etc. Every year before school starts and the first few weeks they close their aisles off. I&#039;ve been told because people come in and shoplift. I get that but don&#039;t you want your customers to buy things????? Today I went in with a list and just wanted to get it done with close to home but couldn&#039;t because the aisles were closed off. I left without buying anything.

			Don&#039;t they have security cameras inside the establishment?<br />We all pay higher prices because of shoplifters, but as we know<br />the penalties are only a slap on the wrist.

			It looks like that store has re-opened as an art supply store.&nbsp; They are open now, but the stock is gradually being added.&nbsp; I hope they do well!

If you would ask them if they had something, they would just grunt and point in a general direction. They genuinely seemed irritated that people were shopping there. Hope the new place does better.
