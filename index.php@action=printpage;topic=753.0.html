				I just happened to look at Steinway Restaurant&#039;s lunch menu and noticed that they offer a Roosevelt Avenue Chicken Quesadilla for $10.00.&nbsp; The dessert menu has an interesting item called a Caramel Apple Chubbie.&nbsp; That&#039;s an adorable name.&nbsp; Brown sugar custard swirled with apples and caramel in a pastry crust, topped with pecan streusel and more caramel for $5.50.&nbsp; Hmm.....I may just have to be the guinea pig on this one.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if this is the kind of place that mostly travelers frequent or if it&#039;s a neighborhood restaurant.

				Chuckster,&nbsp; It is in the lobby of the hotel so I would assume guests make up a great deal of their business.&nbsp; The pricing seems to be typical of hotels - high.

				Does the Crown Plaza still have the buffets on Fridays and Saturday evenings and Sunday brunch? They were pretty good and reasonably priced. Also, came with free parking.&nbsp; ;D
