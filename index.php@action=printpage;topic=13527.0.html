				We have decided that Swim Two Birds will be the name of the restaurant opening on 37th Avenue between 75th and 76th streets this fall. <br /><br />People who are interested in following the restaurant&#039;s progress from now until opening are invited to follow our new Twitter account at https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny&nbsp; (@SwimTwoBiirdsNY).<br /><br />We have also opened Facebook and Instagram accounts and will be posting those links tomorrow.<br /><br />One of the major issues for guests is comfortable seating. I&#039;m excited to say that tomorrow morning I&#039;ll be paying a visit to Artistic Frame&#039;s New York office to confirm an order for custom chairs for our restaurant. You can see Artistic Frame&#039;s work at http://artisticframe.com/browse/showcases.asp?showcaseid=2<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I like the Flann O&#039;Brien reference, Stew. Will you have Guinness on tap? Hopefully you don&#039;t get TOO meta with the menu. <br /><br />Best of luck shepherding your vision into existence -- seems like an exciting and necessary addition to the neighborhood!

				zubloop, cassat,<br /><br />Ireland&#039;s public broadcaster - RTÉ - broadcast an excellent documentary about Flann O&#039;Brien in 2007. It won the Irish Film and Television Award that year for Best Documentary.&nbsp; Brendan Gleeson narrates.

				I&#039;m looking forward to working with the Jackson Heights Greenmarket vendors. They offer excellent produce at prices significantly more reasonable than Union Square.

				Today&#039;s issue will resonate with anyone who has considered natural stone for a kitchen counter. We spent the day visiting three companies on Long Island that sell quartzite, marble and granite. We plan a natural stone bar, and some of us involved in the project, although not all, are keen on stone table tops.<br /><br />On looks, we&#039;d go with marble in a heartbeat. As a practical matter, it scratches easily and doesn&#039;t get along well with acids, as in spilled wine and citrus wedges. The patina might look great at year 10, maybe less great at six months.<br /><br />The upshot is that I&#039;m phoning two friends tomorrow who know a thing or two about stone, but don&#039;t sell it and therefore don&#039;t have a stone to grind: a friend in Vermont who uses stone wall techniques to create art, and a friend in Canada who is a sculptor.<br /><br />Hoping that the friend in Vermont will be able to give me the straight goods on Vermont Danby marble, which while expensive is beautiful and is said to be tougher (denser, less porous) than most marble.

There&#039;s enough difference in stock that it&#039;s worth visiting a few of them. As you may know (we didn&#039;t), the way the business works only your fabricator can give you a quote. The yards won&#039;t tell you more than that stone A will be more expensive than stone B, and they won&#039;t even tell you by how much. So you write down the code for the slabs you&#039;re interested in, and the yard sends that info off to your fabricator, who will then give you a price. Fairly frustrating, actually.<br /><br />And of course the lighting in the yards is all over the place, and won&#039;t match the lighting of your interior. So who knows what the stone will wind up looking like :)<br /><br />I have a call in to my Vermont friend, who I&#039;m hoping will be a big help.

				We finally have Artistic Frame&#039;s renderings for matching dining and bar chairs. Artistic needs a fair amount of time to make these, so they may not be quite ready for our soft opening. But I think they&#039;re going to be worth the wait. Plus, it was a great excuse to hang out for a bit at the D&amp;D Building. We&#039;ll choose fabric, and decide on a few design details (shown in red in the photos) over the next few days, and then the chairs will go into production.

				Hey Stew, they say it&#039;s French and American food, but is it perhaps Canadian? Even New Canadien? <br /><br /><br />I ask because New Canadien is possibly my favorite type of food, though I&#039;m not exactly sure what it is.

The influences come from many sources. It is much simpler for a restaurant to say that it is French, Colombian, Italian, Thai or Chinese, or to use a regional label like Southern, Louisiana, New England, etc.<br /><br />To take an example, there is nothing more archetypical of eastern North American cooking, from Nova Scotia to New York, than chowder. We&#039;ll be offering a lobster chowder as a signature dish. But the use of classic French techniques in its preparation means that it will be very different from what most people have experienced.<br /><br />Thanks, you gave me the idea that it might be fun to offer French-Canadian tourtière for brunch over the Christmas season :)<br />

We are looking at opening late October.

However, there was a beloved Québec cook named Jeanne Benoit, who in the 1960s was in Québec as important as Julia Child was in the U.S., whose recipe for tourtière is the inspiration for many families today. You won&#039;t have trouble finding her recipe on the internet. Like Julia Child, she had a TV show, and some of the footage may well be on YouTube (although it&#039;s all almost certainly in French).

I&#039;m not saying anything about the quality of the other Ottomanelli butcher shops, only that, apart from sharing a family name, there is in fact no connection.

				Only of interest to people really into design ... :)<br /><br />We decided today that we&#039;re going with Christofle flatware.<br /><br />Pattern here: https://www.facebook.com/SwimTwoBirdsNY/posts/514835085349395<br /><br />We&#039;ve also decided that we&#039;re going with Bernardaud china. Haven&#039;t chosen a pattern yet, but will in the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Great that the woman who runs Bernardaud&#039;s North America sales lives in Queens and knows Jackson Heights really well.

				Hurray!<br /><br />Looks like the city will approve our blueprints this week and that we can go from taking things apart to putting them together.<br /><br />I want Swim Two Birds to be fairly casual, but that isn&#039;t inconsistent with good design. Looking forward to a meeting at Bernardaud Wednesday about matching their china with the Christofle flatware we&#039;ve chosen. <br /><br />And I&#039;m having great discussions with my sister, an accomplished potter, about pieces that she&#039;s going to make for our guests.<br /><br />It&#039;s starting to come together. <br /><br />

				it&#039;s cool to read about all the design elements and decisions that you are making (and no doubt these little things add up to a more significant whole) but my main concern is the food. how about keying us in to ideas you&#039;re floating around in terms of the menu composition, such as the type of dishes you&#039;re going to be offering? from the little that i&#039;ve read or heard about swim two birds, it&#039;s going to be a bistro type place with french-canadian influences? or did i get that totally wrong? so...does that mean poutine and terrine de foie gras, or more french-canadian-american type of fare, like twists on classics? it would be great to get a sense of some of the types of dishes and flavors STB will offer. as a vegetarian, i&#039;d like to put in a plea to please consider us herbivores and put at least one creative vegetarian entree on the menu (that isn&#039;t just &quot;grilled vegetable plate&quot;). also, maybe a heads up on the price points you&#039;re thinking...will entrees be around the $20-30 mark, higher, or lower? how about appetizers, salads, etc? i&#039;m really looking forward to this restaurant opening up--the sooner, the better!

				thanks for your response, stew! it&#039;s great that you&#039;re keeping vegetarians in mind when creating the menu; i&#039;m really pleased to hear that. this is all sounding very exciting and promising and i like how transparent you are and have been through the process, incorporating feedback from the community and keeping us in the loop on choices from small to big ones. as i said before, i can&#039;t wait to see the end result and to dine in comfort, style, and deliciousness hopefully very soon!

				We had a great meeting with Bernaurdaud and Christofle today followed by yet another bizarre meeting with the Community Board 3 business committee.<br /><br />The meeting started with us introducing ourselves by name but getting responses only from people we asked. <br /><br />Not a single member of the Commlttee volunteered his or her name.<br /><br />It&#039;s sort of like appearing before a parole board, except that I&#039;m pretty sure that Parole Board.members tell you who they are. <br /><br />

				Our Community Board members seriously need a good shaking.&nbsp; At a recent meeting about their approval or disapproval of the proposed upward expansion of the N.E. half of the block on 37th Ave. between 84th &amp; 85th Sts.,&nbsp; almost none of them were present at the posted starting time.&nbsp; &nbsp; They slowly sauntered in (yes, sauntered - no sense of urgency whatsoever!) over the next 45 minutes and, even then, they were totally unprepared.&nbsp; The documents they required had to be sent for.<br /><br />No explanation or apology was offered, even though several dozen people from the neighborhood showed up, keenly interested in the outcome of the meeting.<br /><br />This is shameful treatment of the people in the neighborhood they are supposed to serve.

				Language is both beautiful and amusing in its complexity :)<br /><br />We&#039;ll be serving our guests, and offering our menu, in both English and Spanish.<br /><br />So of course, the first question is, what are the New York City Spanish equivalents of the words Dinner/Supper, Lunch and Brunch.<br /><br />So far, there seems to be a consensus that in New York Brunch is the right word in both languages, despite the fact that there are a good many references on the internet to Spanish terms for Brunch.<br /><br />There also seems to be a consensus that Almuerzo is the right word for Lunch.<br /><br />As it happens, there is debate among Hispanic people with whom I have discussed this about the right word for Dinner (or, as some people call it, Supper, which mostly proves that there&#039;s no agreement even in English - as far as my Newfoundland (in Spanish, Terranova) friends are concerned, Dinner is what New Yorkers would call Lunch, and Supper is the evening meal, a rather important distinction if one has been invited over for one or the other).<br /><br />What&#039;s your vote for the New York Spanish word for Dinner/Supper? Hint: Cena is not universally approved.<br /><br />And if you think that settling on Brunch and Almuerzo is wrong, I&#039;d love to hear that too.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Stew<br /><br />Our Website (http://swimtwobirds.nyc)<br />Swim Two Birds on Facebook (https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Instagram (https://instagram.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Twitter (https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />My Personal Tweets (https://twitter.com/stewartwadden)<br /><br /><br />

				For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m from an area where dinner and supper are used. Mostly, it&#039;s interchangeable. Dinner was more of a Sunday thing. You had a dinner at lunch time on Sunday. I think it was an after church thing. Families would have a big meal after church - pot roast, potatoes, roasted veggies -- the type of thing you could put in the oven before church and have a big meal at noon after services, sunday school, etc. That meal was called dinner. Every other time dinner/supper could be used interchangeably. <br /><br />Will all your front-of-house staff be bilingual?

				Regarding dinner vs supper etc, don&#039;t be afraid to educate your customers. If you write the hours, the public will get it. <br /><br /><br />And as far as languages, there are many people from south asia who can speak many languages in that area, so if you get a special person they will have you covered. For east asian, I guess youre talking about the Thai element in our neighborhood, which does not usually cross with the South asian language people. HOWEVER for both, most people who are here from those countries speak english too (and those that don&#039;t are almost definitely not going to saunter in alone) so I would not even worry about the language stuff for those countries. That being said, it&#039;s a wonderful seeing a staff of the entire rainbow - the best example Ive ever seen is at Cannelle Patisserie.

My Spanish is limited to asking where the bathroom is, and there&#039;s a number of businesses in the neighborhood that only offer menus or a list of services in Spanish. I just usually avoid going there, because it seems like if they wanted English speaking customers, they&#039;d provide a menu/list of services in English. (I&#039;m not suggesting a business should have a menu in every language possible, but how about at least the two most used languages)<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna guess your web design company probably lacks a fluent Spanish speaker. The truth is, setting up and maintaining English and Spanish pages isn&#039;t all that complicated. It just takes a site from say 10 pages to 20. Changes made to the menu would require two pages to be updated. If the web design company is going to be responsible for proofing the copy, if they don&#039;t have someone fluent in Spanish, they may be concerned about the quality of the Spanish pages if they are relying on you to provide perfect copy. However, if you&#039;re just looking at entries like: Soup of the Day/Sopa de Dia or an explanation of the dish in English/Spanish, or your About page with copy in English and then Spanish underneath, that&#039;s even less work. It just requires the copy to be proofed by a copy editor who is fluent in both English and Spanish.<br /><br /><br />^^^I love learning about how language evolves. Another funny thing where I&#039;m from: green bell peppers are called mangoes (mostly by the 60+ crowd). I never really thought much of it because I don&#039;t really recall the fruit being in the grocery stores when I was a kid, but when I moved here mangoes were everywhere. I&#039;ve only really begun to eat them in the last couple of years after someone showed me how to cut them up. I looked in to it, and it turns out pickled mangoes were really popular in the colonies, and then everything that was pickled was eventually just called mangoes. Turns out green peppers were a popular pickled item too (and no doubt cheaper since they could be grown in the colonies), and for some reason calling them mangoes just stuck.

				As of today, I have been waiting for a building permit for about seven weeks.<br /><br />I have made two appearances before the Business Committee of our Community Board, during which not a single member has offered his or her name without being directly asked.<br /><br />According to the Business Committee, I am now going to be summoned to appear before the full Community Board, whenever it gets around to it.<br /><br />Nobody has been able to explain the point of these meetings, except for one gentleman on the Business Committee who told me that the repeated appearances are about me demonstrating that my restaurant is &quot;good enough&quot; for Jackson Heights.

Do any of these meetings you are summoned to attend have agendas or outlines that are given to the attendees beforehand? I&#039;m curious as to what specific information they are looking for, if as you say, they are trying to prove your worthiness in the neighborhood. <br /><br />I absolutely agree with you -- since these seem to be informal, nonsensical meetings without any real guidelines, why don&#039;t you go in and set some up for them. I think as long as you&#039;re assertive and forthcoming yourself, asking for names and more clarification is within your right as a member of the community in which this Board is serving. <br /><br />Good luck, and keep us posted! I, for one, am very much anticipating the restaurant&#039;s opening!!

Do any of these meetings you are summoned to attend have agendas or outlines that are given to the attendees beforehand?

I, for one, am very much anticipating the restaurant&#039;s opening!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We have appeared before the Business Committee twice in relation to our application to the NY State Liquor Authority, and the next stop is an appearance before the full Board. <br /><br />There are members of the Business Committee who seem to know what their role is and members who either don&#039;t know or don&#039;t care. Among the latter are people who apparently think that they have the right to decide whether our restaurant is a good fit for Jackson Heights. I think it&#039;s a fair statement that the gentleman who expressed this view at our last meeting wouldn&#039;t know what a good restaurant is if he fell over one.<br /><br />We have been given next to no advance notice of the two meetings that we have attended. On arrival, one is required to sign in, but one is not given the names of the Business Committee members much less a list of the members who are in attendance.<br /><br />When one&#039;s name is called, one goes into what is supposed to be a public meeting, except that when one enters the room the door is closed, barring entrance to any member of the public and other applicants who might be interested in how the Board functions.<br /><br />At the first meeting we attended, no member identified himself or herself when speaking. At the second meeting, we made a point of going up to, and shaking hands with, the members closest to us, which resulted in those people offering their names. Nobody outside our immediate range offered their hand or, when they spoke, their name. <br /><br />I am hoping that when we appear before the full Board, the members will either have the courtesy to identify themselves when they speak or, if that is too much effort, have a name card in front of their unengaged head. <br /><br />My sense is that the members of the Business Committee are well-intended, despite the fact that a couple of them seem to be self-appointed guardians of what they consider neighbourhood &quot;standards&quot;.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Department of Buildings told us today that it wants an asbestos test. Perfectly reasonable, if it hadn&#039;t been done before, but the fact that it&#039;s taken them seven weeks to ask is ridiculous. <br /><br /><br />

				On the upside...<br /><br />After my first appearance before the Business Committee in May/June, I asked why there was no information whatever on the Community Board 3 process on liquor license applications. <br /><br />The Board&#039;s web site now includes that information. <br /><br />I also noted that the Board&#039;s web site information on the status of Jackson Heights liquor licenses was five years out of date and suggested that they either kill this info or keep it up to date. <br /><br />If you look at the Board&#039;s site today, it appears that they decided to kill this information instead of maintaining it. That said, it might be helpful if the Board pointed out, and provided a link to, the NY State Liquor Authority page from which one can search for the current status of any Jackson Hieghts establishment.<br /><br />Stew<br /><br />Our Website with a link to get info on our opening (http://swimtwobirds.nyc)<br />Swim Two Birds on Facebook (https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Instagram (https://instagram.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Twitter (https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />My Personal Tweets (https://twitter.com/stewartwadden)<br />

				There&#039;s been good progress on what our Community Board reveals on its website (see above).<br /><br />Here are some questions about our upcoming meeting with our Community Board, and which we will raise in an e-mail to the Board tomorrow:<br /><br />Will members identify themselves when they speak?<br /><br />If not, will they have a name card in front of them?<br /><br />If the latter, what do they intend to do to accommodate people who attend who are blind or who can&#039;t read a distant card?<br /><br />Will the Board, or the Member in question, tell us who the Community Board Member is who made statements anonymously on this forum about our application before the Board? it is obvious to me that if Daniel Dromm made anonymous posts to Jackson Heights Life on an application to City Council, it would be a disgrace. I want the Member, or if she or he refuses, the Board, to come clean in this, failing which we will walk out of the meeting.<br /><br />If I&#039;m going to run a business in our neighbourhood, I need to know that our Community Board is democratic, public, accessible and transparent, and I am prepared to take a stand on these issues.<br /><br />The Board has made changes to its website since my initial appearance and expression of concerns, but there remains a distance to go. <br /><br />Stew<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

Sounds like a win for the Board that would increase the confidence of both businesses and residents of our neighbourhood. <br /><br />I want to be clear that my sense is that a number of the Board members want to see the Board to be more transparent, and the Board has made changes to its web site that, coincidently or not, respond to concerns that I expressed back in May. And yes, our first appearance was in May, our second was in September, and apparently I will be summoned to a third appearance, today being October 6, whenever the full Board gets around to it.

				Brooklyn Community Board 2&#039;s web site is among the many Community Board sites that is rather more informative than ours, not to mention that is looks like it was made post 1985: http://www.nyc.gov/html/bkncb2/html/about/about.shtml<br /><br />Among other things, the Board says about its responsibility&#039;s to its constituents:<br /><br />&quot;Although unsalaried, the volunteer members are public officials and are regulated as such. Community board members are subject to Chapter 68 of the New York City Charter (&quot;Conflicts of Interest&quot;) and the rules of the City&#039;s Conflicts of Interest Board. They must also uphold the New York State Public Officers Law, in particular Article 6, the Freedom of Information Law, and Article 7, the Open Meetings Law.<br />Access City Charter Chapter 68 and related documents<br />Read the New York State Freedom of Information Law<br />Read the New York State Public Officers Law&quot;<br /><br />Leaving aside the Open Meetings Law, which my two meetings before the Board&#039;s Business Committee were not, this would seem to mean that a Board that knows that a member has made anonymous posts about a constituent&#039;s application before the Board, and the member, must disclose who that member is. Of course, they can always waste taxpayer money by hiring lawyers to fight it, and explain why they are fighting it.<br /><br />I&#039;m really not looking for a fight with the Board, but to date I am extremely disappointed with its performance and the apparent lack of basic respect by some of its members.

				Today, I asked our Community Board to identify the Member who anonymously criticized us on Jackson Heights Life for raising some issues about how the Board functions and the state of its web site regarding liquor license applications, and who in the process of making these criticisms flatly refused to identify him or her self.<br /><br />I also suggested that it might be helpful if this person self-identified, and in essence asked the Board whether it would like to instead turn this into a Freedom of Information issue that would result in legal costs to our community.<br /><br />Looking forward to our Community Board&#039;s response.<br /><br />I&#039;d be even happier if we didn&#039;t first appear before our Community Boatd five months ago, then again last month, and apparently for a third time whenever they choose to summon us, none of these appearances having an apparent purpose.<br /><br />At my last appearance before our Board, a member pointed out that getting a permit from the Department of Buildings can take a long time. That&#039;s true, but based on what I believe is about to happen, it looks like getting a permit from the Department of Buildings is going to be like lightning compared to the process before our Community Board. <br /><br /><br />Stew<br /><br />Jackson Heights Life Signature<br /><br />Our Website (http://swimtwobirds.nyc)<br />Swim Two Birds on Facebook (https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Instagram (https://instagram.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Twitter (https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />TripAdvisor (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g47960-d8507556-Reviews-Swim_Two_Birds-Jackson_Heights_Queens_New_York.html)<br />My Personal Tweets (https://twitter.com/stewartwadden)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				A bit of good news. The asbestos inspection, notwithstanding that the Building Department has had two months to ask for it, happened quickly and is negative for asbestos.<br /><br />There&#039;s a reasonable chance that we&#039;ll get a building permit this coming week. At that point, given that almost everything we&#039;re doing is cosmetic, the renovation should proceed fairly quickly ... or so I hope. <br /><br />Thanks to everyone who has signed up on our website for updates on our opening.

We have already made two presentations to the Board&#039;s Business Committee, and have presented it with drawings, etc. from which two things are clear. There is no apparent reason for repeated meetings, there are members who don&#039;t know what the Board&#039;s job is, there are members who have no memory of what happens from one meeting to the next, and the Board itself doesn&#039;t know why these meetings are taking place. Believe me, we asked at the last meeting, and couldn&#039;t get an answer.<br /><br />By the way, Rhino is right. BYOB without a liquor license is flat out illegal.

				I&#039;ve lived in JH for almost 30 years, and the few times Ive had to deal with this Community Board have not been positive. Seems like they are on their own time, and are not for the good of the District they represent. When A &quot;sports&quot; bar, with a liquor license and 14 TVs is easier to open than a 30 seat restaurant, from a independent operator, something is not right. Not to mention, their are no less than 6 restaurants within a two block radius with liquor licenses on 37 ave between 85th and 83rd.&nbsp; Did we really need another one on that block? Just saying.....Best of luck you you Stew

				Realistically, we are looking at a January opening, but that said I&#039;m interested in finding out who is out there in the Jackson Heights area who might be interested in working with us.<br /><br />I&#039;m less concerned about experience than about a desire to pitch in to help our restaurant provide our guests with a memorable experience.<br /><br />We are considering a number of approaches to compensation, including a no tipping policy. Ryan Sutton has an excellent article on Danny Meyer&#039;s decision to do this at http://ny.eater.com/2015/10/14/9517747/danny-meyer-no-tipping-restaurants.<br /><br />We may also adopt open book management, which may be of particular interest to people who want to know how a restaurant actually works financially. For more information on open book, see http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/business/at-zingermans-pastrami-and-partnership-to-go.html?<br /><br />If you are a cook, it may interest you to know that we are thinking about our cooks being actively engaged, as at Denmark&#039;s Noma and Dominique Crenn&#039;s new restaurant, in serving guests.<br /><br />We have made a decision to serve our guests in both English and Spanish, which means having at least one bilingual server at all times, so if you speak both languages, let us know. <br /><br />If you are interested, please send me an e-mail and resumé at stewart dot wadden at swimtwobirds dot nyc<br /><br />Thanks

				Just a small comment on the no tipping policy -- when the news came out, my Facebook feed exploded with comments from current and former wait staff.&nbsp; The general consensus was that they would not work in a &quot;no tip&quot; policy restaurant, where the tip would be used to pay fixed salaries for the wait staff and better salaries for the back room staff.&nbsp; My friends took the position that they made more money in tips that they ever would have as a salary, and that by instituting such a policy, the very best wait staff would work elsewhere so as to earn the larger tips.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never worked in a restaurant, but the many replies that I read were all unanimous about this (although they all said that the back room staff should be better compensated by management, but that such compensation should not penalized the wait staff by granting them only a set hourly salary).

				I see that I failed to address the waiter argument that restaurant owners should retain tipping but increase wages for the people who make the food and clean the dishes.<br /><br />This would unquestionably result in higher prices for guests, plus something else...<br /><br />Given current New York tip expectations (apparently about 20%), waiters would get an additional 20% of the increase in prices.<br /><br />So where we&#039;re at is that waiters at quality restaurants are earning a very good living, the people who make the food and clean the dishes are not being paid a living wage, and the solution some waiters propose amounts to a price increase for guests and a raise for waiters.<br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				A Jackson Heights resident has just sent me a tweet about a new NY Eater article on Danny&#039;s Meyer&#039;s decision: &nbsp;The Modern&#039;s No Tipping Policy Is Already Helping to End Its Cook Shortage Crisis (http://ny.eater.com/2015/11/3/9663612/the-modern-no-tipping)<br /><br />Of course, that doesn&#039;t mean that his waiters are happy, although Meyer did say recently that nobody has quit yet.<br /><br />On a lighter note, North Carolina furniture maker Artistic Frame told me today that our matching dining and bar chairs are ready.<br /><br />Photos in two Facebook posts here: https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny<br /><br />When they were ordered, I was concerned that they might not arrive in time for our opening.

				I&#039;ve never been a server in NYC, but I&#039;ve been a server before. I am completely for this no-tipping policy as long as everyone makes better wages. I lived in Paris for some time, and I honestly think it is better for servers to make a living wage--it is especially better for the kitchen staff, and we need to be more concerned about equality. The kitchen staff does as much work as the servers.<br /><br />But then again, maybe I prefer restaurants where I can chill a bit, instead of constantly being bombarded by servers asking what I want.&nbsp; For some reason, I find it rather degrading for servers to have to beg customers just to be able to make decent money. I know many Europeans talk about how great the service is in the States, but in all honesty, I don&#039;t think it is fair for a server to make $2.13 an hour and still have the chance of not being tipped at all. I imagine servers make a higher hourly wage in New York, but still...<br /><br />Looking forward to the opening of your restaurant!

				When you take in to account that fine dining establishments in NYC really are looking for back of house staff with culinary degrees, but under the current system pay them an absolute pittance, it&#039;s no wonder that restaurants are finding it difficult to hire people with training at culinary schools. As Danny Meyers mentioned, you can&#039;t pay people who just dropped $40K at a culinary school $15/hour (or less) in a city with expensive housing and wonder why there is a talent shortage.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a surprise that many servers would have an issue with potentially earning less money, but if the servers actually understood that the current compensation strategy is unsustainable, they could agree that something needs to change.

				Given that I am having no success with our Community Board in direct communication, I want to invite our Board to respond publicly, in this forum, to the two questions that I have raised.<br /><br />First, when will the Board make its position clear on our application for a liquor license, given that we made an application to the Board last April, appeared before its business committee in both May and September, were told in September that we would be required to appear before the full Board, and as of November 6 have no idea when that meeting will take place?<br /><br />Secondly, does the Board believe that it is acceptable for its members to make comments, anonymously, on this or other pubic fora, about applicants and/or applications before the Board?<br /><br />I have now been to two meetings of the Board&#039;s business committee, and the process doesn&#039;t cut it. These meetings are effectively held in secret, the committee is arrogant, some members apparently think that they are living in the 1950s, and the applicants are invariably obsequious. <br /><br />Much obliged to our Community Board for answers to these basic questions.

				Stew, have you reached out to Danny Dromm about this matter? I know nothing about local politics, really, but I doubt that raising these questions/issues on this board will help at all, and it might even hurt. There are probably some backroom maneuvers or string-pulling of some sort that could help. It seems as if some new restaurants don&#039;t have a problem, like those new sports bars. I&#039;m thinking of that place on 37th in the 80s and I think there is another one near there, too. Why is that? Do some people have a special &quot;in&quot; with the Community Board such that they get special consideration? Do the commercial realtors who try to get businesses like restaurants to lease space have any insights into this? I don&#039;t have a clue, but there must be some way to find out more about how it really works (as opposed to how maybe it&#039;s supposed to work.)

				As a New York and Long Island restaurant, we&#039;ll be offering wines from the Finger Lakes and the North and South Forks. I hope to visit some of the Finger Lakes winemakers next week, and today I read a really interesting analysis by Elaine Chukan Brown of Long Island wines. <br /><br />My objective for our wine list is that it be interesting and offer value. But I also have three specific objectives for the wines that we offer by the glass. The first two are obvious - that we offer wines that are better than what is currently offered in Jackson Heights, and that we serve our wines by the glass (and, of course, all of our wines) at the right temperature.<br /><br />Thirdly, I want to offer our guests the opportunity to try wines that they would think twice about, or thrice, due to the cost of a bottle.<br /><br />So today, we took delivery of a Coravin Model Two, an ingenious device that makes it possible to serve glasses of wine from a bottle, over time, without oxidation.<br /><br />The Coravin is now being used in most, if not all, of New York&#039;s top restaurants, and we will be using it at Swim Two Birds.<br /><br />The device itself is not terribly expensive, but the argon adds 60-70 cents to the cost of each 5 ounce glass. For certain wines, that cost is worth it. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested, check out http://coravin.com. They also have an excellent YouTube channel.<br /><br />Stew<br /><br />Our Website (http://swimtwobirds.nyc)<br />Swim Two Birds on Facebook (https://facebook.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Instagram (https://instagram.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />On Twitter (https://twitter.com/swimtwobirdsny)<br />My Personal Tweets (https://twitter.com/stewartwadden)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				i&#039;d say it&#039;s definitely worth it. i was pleasantly surprised the first time i tried by-the-glass wine from a place that used the device. i expected some/even a lot of degradation, but the character is preserved quite well.<br /><br />i also welcome it because while my partner and i will usually end up sharing a bottle over dinner, there are times when we order dishes that are different enough to warrant ordering different wines, and it&#039;s nice to have more than two or three choices. <br /><br />thanks for that consideration.

				At a restaurant called Ditch Plains in Soho I was shocked when they said they do not serve wines by the glass—even at the bar. It&#039;s a bottle or nothing.

				On Friday, we had a telephone discussion with Giovanna Ried, District Manager of our Community Board. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the bottom line. <br /><br />Ms. Reid admitted that she failed to tell our law firm, on record as the Board&#039;s contact with us, that we were required to attend the October meeting of the Board&#039;s Economic Committee.<br /><br />Ms. Reid took the position that her failure to advise our law firm of record of the meeting wasn&#039;t her problem, but rather ours. <br /><br />In other words, Ms. Reid&#039;s position, and indeed the Board&#039;s, to the extent that she represents it, is that it will be at least seven months before the full Board deals with our application. She made it quite clear that she thinks that this is hunkey dory. <br /><br />On the question of Board members anonymously attacking applicants on this and other fora, Ms. Reid effectively said that our Board has no problem with such attacks. <br /><br />Just stunning.

				Time for all of us to start attending community board meetings. I&#039;ll look at the calendar and make the ones I&#039;m able to—they need some kind of accountability. Do you REALLY need their approval for the liquor license, though? Aren&#039;t they just suggestions to the state liquor board? They&#039;re really shockingly inept and nasty. I&#039;m so sorry they&#039;re treating you this way.

				I don&#039;t think you need their approval. This community board is a joke and yes people from the community need to be more active and demand accountability. They are suppose to be working for the community. I might even think of contacting neighborhood media to have them investigate how the community board responds to residents. Really disheartening. You do have the support of the community to help in any way we can.

				Stew, I can no longer recall--did you reach out to Danny Dromm?<br /><br />Re: publicity about the problem in the Queens media, how about in the Times? I can discuss with my husband, who works in media strategy and PR. We do have some connections at the Times as well, but of course they need to be pitched in the right way and then it&#039;s up to fate and luck a bit whether or not they bite, think the topic has broad enough importance, etc. <br /><br />I have not had time to read the &quot;queenscrap&quot; link yet. Certainly this seems not on the up and up. Do certain people get preferential treatment? Does one have to pay someone off? These are just the questions that are coming to mind. I just don&#039;t get it--it&#039;s because of liquor, is that the issue? Before the Indian chain you are replacing, there was another Indian restaurant there that did serve wine and beer.

				As some of you know, several months ago a Department of Buildings inspector gave us a Stop Work Order in which he alleged that we were running a renovation without a building permit and in an unsafe manner. Indeed, a few people here were quick, in a earlier thread, to embrace the quite serious allegations that were posted on our front window. <br /><br />Basically, he entered like John Wayne and slammed us. <br /><br />In fact, we were making non-structural, cosmetic changes that involved ripping up floor and ceiling tiles as well as removing, with hand tools, vents that had not been used for years. Our main motivation was to determine whether there was an original floor or ceiling worth preserving. <br /><br />Last Friday morning, an Administrative Judge dismissed the Department of Building&#039;s allegations in their entitety.<br /><br />On late Friday morning, the same enforcement officer showed up and said, flippantly, &quot;so you won in court&quot;. When we suggested to him that what he did has resulted, for us, in a costly nightmare, he walked out.<br /><br />This morning, the Departnent of Buildings lifted the Stop Work Order.<br /><br />This BS has cost us a great deal of time and a great deal of money.<br /><br />This guy slammed us without thinking about what was going on and without asking any questions.<br /><br />This has cost us a lot of time and tens of thousands of dollars. One of the reasons that it has taken so long to resolve this is that the we spent hours earlier this fall at the Administrative Court, for a hearing, only to be told that the inspector had called into work sick. Apparently, we and our lawyer were not entitled to the courtesy of notice of this. <br /><br />And yes, I am concerned that the Deoartment of Buuldings, and this inspector and his colleagues, will read this and have it in for us. <br /><br />But somebody has to say something. <br /><br />Stew

				Here are two problems trying to open a business that is of interest to Jackson Heighrs residents, and creates employment, in Jackson Heights:<br /><br />The Department of Buildings sends out an inspector to close down completely legal activity in order to increase city revenue (in our case, a $6500 bogus fine, which the city will now be required to repay - yes, we had to pay the &quot;fine&quot; up front in order to appeal -, but not the tens of thousands of dollars that this has cost us). <br /><br />Ms. Giovanni Reid, on behalf of our Community Board, tells us that it&#039;s our problem that her office has failed to keep our counsel of record apprised of meetings of my local community board, which I support with my tax dollars, and which I hope to continue to support when, and if, my community board figures out (having met with me twice already) that a contemporary American restaurant, based on French technique, is not a threat to Jackson Heights. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				petster, the mods created a different thread a while ago for this topic.

				It&#039;s been radio silence for months and no activity. I inquired of someone who should know, and was told that there is some sort of violation, not in that storefront but in the building housing it, and the DOB has halted the work.

				he&#039;s gone silent here because of the many skirmishes, but there&#039;ve been no updates at all on the restaurant&#039;s social media, nor any evidence of work on the space (i live down the block and pass it at least twice a day). that&#039;s not encouraging, although i&#039;ve seen embryonic restaurants go dormant for months at a time before sprinting to the finish.

				Regardless of wether it opens or not, there&#039;s a story to be told here. Doing business is not easy here in Jackson Heights and that&#039;s why we&#039;ve not seen the independently owned community centric stores open like in Williamsburg or Bushwick.

				Yet small restaurants seem to spring up all the time here. I&#039;m thinking of Saw Shack and Oceanic Boil (that took a long time) and Emoji Burger and the new Teriyaki take out place that seems close to opening and the Japanese place on 37th near 76th and the place that preceded the planned Swim Two Birds in that space. And all the many, many sports bars up and down 37th. Yet certain projects just seem to encounter barrier after barrier after barrier.

				I have to wonder if the predominant holdup was a liquor license, which, according to the many posts made by the proprietor seemed to be the issue, had he made a different business decision to continue construction as planned and open up while waiting to get the liquor license would we have already seen this restaurant in existence.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stew seemed&nbsp; dead set on not opening a restaurant until the liquor license was granted.&nbsp; If things had been done differently from a managerial perspective would this now be a neighborhood success story rather than a big question mark as to whether it will ever come to be.<br /><br />Small business issues aside, I wonder if the predominant problem was based upon rookie mistakes being made.
