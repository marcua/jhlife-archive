				Are you looking to repair a chair that needs to be welded in order to&nbsp; be fixed?&nbsp; Or looking to fabricate a new chair?&nbsp; <br /><br />I did see some flyers while on one of my walks recently advertising welding.&nbsp; I wish I had taken the number down.&nbsp; I noticed it because my bf comes from a country where welding is done routinely to fix problems with cars such as a small hole in the muffler (as opposed to, say, buying an entirely new muffler for $400) and when I had this type of problem he called around to many garages for me and was told no over and over.&nbsp; Finally he found a guy originally from a country in his region who told him that they don&#039;t do this here in garages in the US because it&#039;s not lucrative enough for them.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s why I was interested to see the flyer advertising it - but since I had gotten my muffler fixed already, I did not take the number.<br /><br />I have met a number of people who do know how to weld (sculptors) but don&#039;t know anyone offhand who provides this service.&nbsp; But I will keep an ear to the ground or ask around.

				Hi Shelby, thanks. Yeah, the chair needs to be fixed. We were going to call around at garages but you have saved me the trouble!&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep a lookout as well.

				Mabye I will try to retrace my steps on the walk I took last Sunday and see if I happen to notice the flyer again.&nbsp; The problem was it was a LOOOONG walk - from 85th St. all the way to 39th St in Sunnyside.&nbsp; Though it could be quite nice to do it today in the snow.

				This isn&#039;t local, but there&#039;s a metal place in SoHo, on Grand Street (south side of street) as you walk from West Broadway to the East. I&#039;ve had them manufacture small metal pieces for me for an exhibit. They might be able to fix your chair. It seems they do small odds and ends things. The guy who works there is pretty straightforward and the prices seemed very reasonable to me. You might want to take him a picture of the problem before lugging the chair all the way there. Take the E to Canal Street.

				I&#039;d guess that there are some places in Long Island City if you drive around the more industrial areas looking for signs. A little further afield, there are a number of metal fabricating and welding shops in Brooklyn -- west of 4th Ave between 1st street and 9th street. I&#039;m sure one of them would take on the job, though you may have to try a few before you find one that will do it.

				The flyer says: small welding projects, repairs, automotive, home, 646-683-4881.&nbsp; Flyers looked relatively unscathed so probably somewhat fresh.<br />
