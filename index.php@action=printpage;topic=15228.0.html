				So I read this article this morning:<br /><br />http://jacksonheightspost.com/peralta-roosevelt-avenue-is-the-times-square-of-old-calls-for-commission-to-combat-crime<br /><br />While I am all for combating crime on Roosevelt, I dislike the concept of enforcing the cabaret license requirements.&nbsp; I view dance as a form of expression.&nbsp; A good song comes on the jukebox and I want to dance.&nbsp; These laws are just stupid.&nbsp; You want to enforce the law - then try enforcing the laws regarding drugs, serving alcohol to minors, excessive noise, prostitution, guns, fights and gangs.&nbsp; A little dancing never hurt anyone.<br /><br />I say this because in the good ole Guliani days, I would be in an east village dive gay bar and a great song would come on.&nbsp; When people, naturally, started to dance, the bouncer would go around the club to tell them to stop.&nbsp; The bar, it seems, would be ticketed regularly for permitting people to dance without a cabaret license.&nbsp; It was a joke back then, it&#039;s a joke now.&nbsp; It&#039;s a way to say &quot;I&#039;m enforcing the law&quot; without actually doing anything about crime.

				someone should just add a direct RSS feed from the Jackson Heights Post to this forum. Pretty much every article there gets posted here within an hour or two.

				Good for State Senator Peralta.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t about dancing.&nbsp; This is about stemming the drugs, prostitution, sex trafficking and other illegal activity along Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;And it&#039;s about time.&nbsp; I hope he gets some support from Mayor De Blasio.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It would be a game changer for the neighborhood.&nbsp; No more spill over from the avenue on tour residential streets.

				I&#039;m curious (though I guess it doesn&#039;t matter too much as they&#039;re leaving in December.&nbsp; Is that definite?) if Terraza has a cabaret license.&nbsp; Because many consider them to be a positive attribute to the Roosevelt Ave scene.&nbsp; But if you&#039;ve got hot latin bands with the inability to &quot;dance&quot;, that would be a darn shame.

				This has been a long time in coming, and I hope the effort is successful.&nbsp; Just remember, if these property owners and merchants were law abiding assets to our community, there would not be a need for this.&nbsp; As I have said for many years, &quot;if my grandmother could figure out was is going on, on Roosevelt Avenue, why can&#039;t our police/city agencies/fill in the blank?????&quot;&nbsp; And then, of course, why aren&#039;t they doing something about it????&nbsp; Thank you Sen.

				What would a &quot;cleaned up&quot; Roosevelt Ave look like? Hopefully not <em>present day</em> Times Square?<br /><br />Honestly, I wonder how much of the problems stem from the fact that Roosevelt is just physically unpleasant. The 7 train is LOUD as hell (seemingly more so than other elevated trains) and drips foul runoff onto the street, and the heavy vehicle traffic brings more noise and adds diesel fumes. None of that really matters for going out drinking and dancing to loud music, but it&#039;s not like people are going to start opening up sidewalk cafes if the rowdy places get shut down.<br /><br />It seems to me what we need is more police presence at night to actually enforce existing laws, not some No Fun Allowed crusade.

				&nbsp;Paint it, for one thing. Its so dark and drab now. The artists project on the Lower East Side on the safety gates of stores<br />that has been getting publicity lately could be one way to make it attractive. And be innovative here. Make use of the structure<br />of the elevated line and be creative.Other parts of the city manage to take what they have and use it to their best advantage<br />so why can&#039;t we do it here along the Roosevelt Ave. corridor? <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;A design competition anyone?

				They could start with painting over all the gang graffiti on the north side between 86th and 90th. Every day there is a new Sureño (FSR/FRS/SUR 13) tag and they like to go big. It would also send the message that hooligans are not welcome.
