			In the past couple weeks I’ve seen several co-ops listed and go into contract, even in the higher price points of $900k+. And a few of these deals happened FAST, like within two weeks of listing. It looks like some buyers know what they’re looking for and are eager to move in.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the country, real estate is going for 20%+ over pre-pandemic prices, while here in Jackson Heights it still seems a bit lower than before. Yet the nicer Jackson Heights co-ops have many of the benefits of suburbs (space, community feel, gardens) coupled with urban appeals.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, what’s the outlook? A new crop of young professionals moving in? Prices rising quickly as Jackson Heights takes on more of a Park Slope/Prospect Heights vibe? Yuppies spoiling the neighborhood? Omakase sushi? A subsequent drop in prices if many new sellers emerge?<br /><br />

			My own guess is that due to the pandemic, urban living (which is what we have here in Jackson Heights) will be out of fashion for a while.<br />

			We shall see, though I’m also hearing that deal activity has picked up, especially as NYC recovers more quickly than some other areas. I’m a believer that the same cultural forces that have been attracting people to cities for decades will rapidly overcome pandemic headwinds. <br /><br />Also, the suburbs have gotten so expensive so quickly — Jackson Heights becomes the not-so-hidden gem that can offer a best-of-both-worlds appeal. Who’s even leaving (and selling) given these possible dynamics?

			Some of the people leaving (and selling) are people who have lost their jobs :&#039;(<br /><br />Unemployment in NYC is still rising, it was 12.6% in January and 12.9% in March.<br /><br />By contrast it was 4.1% in 2018.

Those positives still hold, but they aren&#039;t advantages in the pandemic mindset at all. <br />
