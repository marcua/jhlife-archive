				Somehow we&#039;ve never had a thread dedicated specifically to Colombian food.&nbsp; With the Colombian Independence Day Festival (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=985.0) coming up soon, the New York Times has run a long article on Colombian eateries citywide....<br /><br />The New York Times<br />A Fruit Shake, Then Shaking to the Beat of Cumbia (http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/travel/15weekend.html) <br />by SETH KUGEL, June 15, 2008<br /><br /><br /><br />What are your favorite places?&nbsp; I must say that El Basurero in Astoria (mentioned in the article) is a hoot, and is worth visiting for the decor alone.&nbsp; <br /><br />The article also mentions a &quot;Colombian Day Parade&quot; on June 27th.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anybody know anything about that?&nbsp; Is it different from the Colombian Independence Day Festival on July 20th?

				I just saw a sign for natilla, the Colombian Christmas custard, in the window of the restaurant on the corner of 83rd St and 37th Ave (Pollos a la Brasa Mario). <br /><br />This is info from about.com (http://southamericanfood.about.com/od/holidayrecipes/r/natilla.htm)<br /><em>Natilla is a rich, custard-like dessert that is enjoyed during Christmas in Colombia. It is traditionally served with round deep-fried cheese fritters called buÃ±uelos. Natilla is similar to dulce de leche, but it is thickened with cornstarch, and made with panela, a dark molasses-like sugar that is a byproduct of sugarcane processing. Some recipes for natilla include shredded fresh coconut</em>. <br /><br />

				There is a new Colombian/American place called &quot;Tierras Deliciosas&quot; opening on Roosevelt near 83rd St. on the Elmhurst side.&nbsp; It&#039;s right next to the Korean grocer on the corner.&nbsp; They have the signage up and they had most of the diner-like booths in place.&nbsp; It&#039;s mostly glass in the front so you can see everything inside from the sidewalk.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think I saw a sign that said their grand opening is Jan. 17.

				The blog We Are Never Full has and interesting and helpful primer on Colombian food (http://www.weareneverfull.com/cositas-ricas-a-colombian-food-primer-a-podcast/), featuring Cositas Ricas.&nbsp; The also includes a podcast, so you can listen to it on your iPod while eating there.
