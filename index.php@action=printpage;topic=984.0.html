				please let me know if this is the case because we were told the women do NOT feel comfortable with a man in the pool which I thought was rather odd. we did not sign our children up because of this and are looking into somewhere else

				To clarify, men are welcome. There have been tons of dads that have participated over the years.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know who told you that information. I&nbsp; used the term &quot;mommy and me&quot; simple to indicate that an adult must accompany the child in the water.&nbsp; The term must have caused some confusion.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; <br /><br />The class is a Red Cross Infant/ preschool aquatics class.&nbsp; Dads, grandpas, moms, grandmas, care givers of all genders are welcomed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Margaret Murray
