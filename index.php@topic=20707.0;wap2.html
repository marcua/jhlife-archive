			How do you find out about becoming a vendor at these flea markets? I assume you rent a space and table, but Mr. Google hasn&#039;t been very helpful.

			My best advice for anyone who wants to sell at a Flea Market is just to show up at the location on the day of the event, and speak to the person in charge about Booth Space, etc. Sometimes there are available spots on the day of the Flea Market. Also, check through on Craig&#039;s List for upcoming Flea Markets, Street Fairs and the like; contact information is usually listed for all postings; email, call and see about Booth Space opportunities.
