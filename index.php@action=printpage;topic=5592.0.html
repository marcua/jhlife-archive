				I was walking my dog this morning around 7:30am and there was a small terrier mix, golden colored, male dog wearing a little sweater vest that had a red design around his neck. &nbsp;He had a crooked smile/mouth face. &nbsp; At first I thought someone was walking him off leash but then I realized there was no one near by so I quietly called him to come and naturally he started running away.<br /><br />My dog and I walked following him for 4 blocks. &nbsp;I knew if we ran, he would just run faster, but I kept him in sight and kept calling softly. &nbsp;This was on 87th Street right off 34th Avenue. &nbsp;He ran across Northern Blvd. and miraculously didn&#039;t get hit. &nbsp;He ran to 32nd Avenue and I lost sight of him so kept walking towards 86th Street. &nbsp;<br /><br />As I was heading down 86th back towards Northern, I saw him behind a house but there was a locked gate across the driveway. &nbsp;I sat there for awhile and kept my hand thru the gate. &nbsp;He would come close but not close enough for me to grab him. &nbsp;He was afraid. &nbsp;I was so sad. &nbsp;Finally I gave up and headed home.<br /><br />I&#039;m just sharing this for two reasons: maybe someone will recognize the dog&#039;s description and know where he was last seen and also because you&#039;re all animal lovers and I know you will feel my sorrow and that somehow helps.<br /><br />Happy thanksgiving.<br />rose
