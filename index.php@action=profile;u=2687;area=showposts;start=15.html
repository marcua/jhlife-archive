					First, establish the existing situation.&nbsp; Goto the basement and measure out a detailed layout.&nbsp; Keep in mind things like emergency egress, fire codes and maintenance access to water pipes, electrical work and the boiler (these might be some of the reasons why it hasn&#039;t been done).&nbsp; Then determine the number of apartments in the co-op, the number of storage units, the wait list, the size of the storage units and the amount of money being charged for their use.&nbsp; Note the number of units which are barely being used or seem like they haven&#039;t been touched in ages.&nbsp; Determine how they are being managed (if it self managed or managed by a company).<br /><br />Second, compare your situation with other co-ops in the area.&nbsp; See their fee structures and how they deal with demand.&nbsp; When we were investigating bicycle storage, I took every opportunity to talk to shareholders at other co-ops (including this forum!) about how they dealt with bike storage.&nbsp; In many cases, mine included, a free storage unit is assigned to each apartment, but there are plenty of others in JH which having waiting lists and fees. <br /><br />Third, list the available actions.&nbsp; Determine how many storage units can be built.&nbsp; Get quotes from storage unit companies for all available scenarios (simple build, leasing, build/management schemes).&nbsp; Weight that against self built ones.&nbsp; Do a cost/revenue analysis.&nbsp; Be creative with your list of available actions:&nbsp; Perhaps a bike storage area would lessen the demand for storage units.&nbsp; Maybe the storage fees are so low that people are careless about them and would move out should they be modernized.<br /><br />Finally, sniff out a sympathetic shareholder.&nbsp; See if it has been hashed out in the past (which it likely has) and see if your action list can avoid any pitfalls.&nbsp; From there you either take it to an active board member or co-op meeting.&nbsp; You major allies are going to be folks who are also on that waiting list as well as people who might be selling in the near future.<br /><br />It&#039;s alot of work and it&#039;s much easier to just raise your hand at a co-op meeting, but it is important to you, it is best to be prepared, especially if it has already been addressed in the co-op.&nbsp; Sometimes all it takes is someone to show some good initiative to get the ball rolling.&nbsp; Good luck!!<br />
