				From the photo, it appears that the dogs are indeed starving and not just recovering from an illness as the owner claims.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/VMXyVrX.jpg)<br /><br /><strong>NY Daily News</strong>:<br /><br />Cops pound on Queens apartment door after animal activist charges owner with mistreatment of two emaciated pit bulls (https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-queens-dog-abuse-20190604-lnpokylfmnf7rezywbbqlqyhlq-story.html)<br /><br /><em>“My dogs were fine before they got sick. Me and my father have done our best to get our dogs back on point. I know it looks really bad, but people need to mind their own business.” He said the dogs are kept together in a cage in the family’s apartment.<br /><br />Asked about reports that he had bragged about selling puppies for $600 each, he said he wasn’t bragging, it was “advertising.”<br /><br />“My dogs got sick and I’m being cast as a bad owner. This has been going on since November. Before that they were fine. They’re no longer sick. All it takes is time to get their weight back. My dogs have regular checkups. We’ve had to borrow money for all the medical costs.”<br /></em><br /><br /><strong>Full article at above link.</strong>
