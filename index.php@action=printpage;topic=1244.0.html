				I&#039;ve never seen this in Jackson Heights, however, on my day-out in Corona (Armstrong house, Leo Latticini&#039;s Deli and Lemon Ice King) my friend and I saw a woman standing outside a building with a HUGE black bunny on a leash.&nbsp; The sight of this enormous bunny (larger than most of the dogs I see in JH) was so striking we wished to stop and take a photo but traffic conditions were not ideal for pulling over.<br /><br />Good luck with getting your bunny in shape!

				I used to walk my rabbit when I went to school upstate. Just make sure that your rabbit is on a harness leash (vs. collar leash) and that it can handle the hearing street traffic, car nosies and seeing dogs outside. Unless, of course, you are just walking it in a garden, then you don&#039;t have to worry about the city elements. By the way, if your rabbit gets spooked it&#039;ll start screaming for its life and try to run away so watch it carefully and protect it from the moment you step outside together.<br /><br />Good luck.

				I used to have 2 bunnies.&nbsp; If you want your bunny to lose weight, you don&#039;t necessarily have to take him for walks outside.&nbsp; You can just create a pen for your bunny to run around in for a little bit each day.&nbsp; Also be mindful of your bunny&#039;s temperament when taking him outside, you wouldn&#039;t want to make him too nervous (unless he&#039;s used to the outside).&nbsp; But otherwise...it&#039;d be really cute to take your bunny for a walk.&nbsp; Just be sure you have the proper harness/leash for him.
