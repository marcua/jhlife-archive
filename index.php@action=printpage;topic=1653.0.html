				The 115th Precinct held a meeting at The Berkeley this evening.&nbsp; It was quite informative.&nbsp; Unfortunately, approximately 15 shareholders attended.&nbsp; If you would like them to come to your building and offer a security meeting, you may contact the precinct directly and they can offer a meeting for the residents of your building as well. :police:

				Could you be so kind as to provide the board with the &quot;executive summary&quot; points that they discussed? i.e. tips on crime prevention, any &#039;uptick&#039; in crime they are seeing lately, helpful hints, etc. etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Such a meeting wouldn&#039;t work at my building due to small size, and similar apathy. <br /><br />Thank you!

				I did not take the minutes of the meeting, but her is some information given and discussed.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Burglaries are up.&nbsp; All reports are on the web and at the Precinct<br />2.&nbsp; Do not leave messages on front for of building indicating your are not home and to ring other unit.&nbsp; That is an invitation for trouble.&nbsp; UPS will then leave another note saying &quot;you weren&#039;t home&quot; etc.&nbsp; Another invitation.<br />3.&nbsp; No need to place more than two well secured locks on door if you will leave all windows open, including fire escape.<br />5.&nbsp; Keep an eye on shoes when contacting 911.&nbsp; The description of white t and blue jeans is what everyone on that night may be wearing.&nbsp; Hat and shirt usually come off immediately.<br />6.&nbsp; Have the video camera in your building record for 24-48 hours.&nbsp; Save the copies for a month in detectives need to review them.<br />7.&nbsp; Do not buzz any one into your building.&nbsp; If an officer appears, contact the precinct and ask whether there is an officer with that name and if you should allow to enter your property, keep precinct on the phone, until you are sure they are who they say they are.<br />8.&nbsp; Young women are getting more and more involved in crimes.<br />9.&nbsp; You can become a blockwatcher.&nbsp; Contact the precinct.<br />10.&nbsp; Create a buddy, buddy system on each of the floors in your building.&nbsp; This could save your belongings and your life.<br />11.&nbsp; If you are not expecting a visitor, no need to respond to the bell.<br />12.&nbsp; Do not open the door and keep the chain on.&nbsp; Anyone can easily kick the door open.<br />13.&nbsp; The precinct is available to go to your building and take a tour with the residents and/or board members to address potential problems and invitation to criminals.<br />14.&nbsp; Lighting and doors not closing properly seem to be a problem.<br />15.&nbsp; Two homeless men where sleeping in middle of block on 37th between 76 and 77th Street on 10/16 (morning) as everyone was on their was to work.&nbsp; The detectives took notes and will offer them assistance.<br />16.&nbsp; If you suspect illegal activity next to your home do not get involved.&nbsp; Contact the precinct and they will assign someone to the case.<br />17.&nbsp; If you know that there is a group that gathers the same time and one the same dates and suspect illegal activity again contact the precinct and they will assign a unit to address that activity.<br />18.&nbsp; Please attend the meeting that is held the third week of the month at the 115th Precinct.<br />19.&nbsp; Call 911 as many times as you feel fit and make sure you give a complete and accurate description of the problem.&nbsp; Many questions will be asked but be as specific as possible, especially with descriptions. These calls then have to be given out to the sectors of each precinct. <br />20.&nbsp; 35,000 for 8 million New Yorker??????<br />22.&nbsp; Some of our trees are in the way of good lighting.&nbsp; Have your building provide the necessary lighting required to prevent crime.&nbsp; We are not removing the trees, we just need the lighting, which the trees sometimes covers.<br />23. Those with GPS units in the car, must remove the piece that holds the unit as well.&nbsp; Remove all laundry bags, videos, dvds, bags of any kinds, car seats from car.&nbsp; Also, not all car break-ins are being reported due to the fear of insurance premium increases.<br /><br />Encourage your neighbors to have the detectives of 115 come to your building or the adjacent building and give this informational meeting.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s the best way to stay safe.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				8.&nbsp; &quot;Young women are getting more and more involved in crimes.&quot;<br /><br />Did he elaborate on that? They are probably working together with others(males)in their crimes. Also they most likely victimize other females. Sounds like druggies to me as is what most criminals are.

				Thanks!&nbsp; That was very informative.&nbsp; We have a similar meeting planned for our building next week.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s a general safety meeting or having specifically to do with the guy who broke in twice and harrassed female residents.&nbsp; If they provide any new security tips that isn&#039;t covered on your list, I&#039;ll post them here.

				Here are some more tips from the safety meeting we had in our building on Tue:<br /><br />- When going out, keep your house keys in a separate place from your driver&#039;s license since your license has your address on it.<br /><br />- When walking on the sidewalk, walk towards the middle of the sidewalk and not near the street because a car or bike could come by and someone could snatch your purse, iPod, or cellphone.&nbsp; (obviously more likely when there are no parked cars between you and the street)<br />The cops said they are seeing more women on bikes robbing pedestrians of their iPods and cellphones.<br /><br />- When you&#039;re out shopping, don&#039;t keep going back to your car to dump shopping bags into your trunk.&nbsp; There are always people in the parking lot or garage on the lookout for that so they can crack open your car and run off with your stuff.&nbsp; Do all your shopping in one trip, dump your stuff in your car, and then drive out of there.<br /><br />- Guys should put a rubber band around their wallet to create more friction when pulling them out of their pockets.&nbsp; Someone who tries to pickpocket you will have more trouble doing so, plus you&#039;ll feel it.<br /><br />- If someone is entering your building behind you and you don&#039;t know him/her, ask the person if he/she lives here and if not, tell the person, &quot;Sorry- I don&#039;t know you.&nbsp; Please ring the bell.&quot;&nbsp; The cops didn&#039;t cover what to do if the person says he/she lives here- maybe ask the person to show you their key?&nbsp; Close the door in their face?&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a very gray area.<br /><br />- If a cop is asking to be let into your building and you didn&#039;t make the call, call the precinct and verify that the cop has a purpose to be here.&nbsp; There are more people impersonating cops these days and they have very convincing outfits.&nbsp; <br /><br />-If you see a suspicious activity, call 911, not the precinct.&nbsp; The precinct will connect you to 911.&nbsp; I know, very odd.
