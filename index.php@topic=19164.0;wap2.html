			If you lived in Jackson Heights during the middle 1940&#039;s to the early 1950&#039;s, do you remember a neighborhood sports team called the Jackson Heights Trojans, or any of their members? We numbered around twenty or so teens and to-date, I know half have passed on. There&#039;s about 10 or so I have lost track of. If anyone remembers the team, and know any of the members, post it here and I will give you the names of those I&#039;d like to find to determine if they are still alive and kicking.&nbsp;
