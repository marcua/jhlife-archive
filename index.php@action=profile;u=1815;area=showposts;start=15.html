					Happy Holidays all.&nbsp; I wanted to share this Christmas classic with all my neighbors-&nbsp; <br /><br />Twas the Night before Christmas Poem<br /><br />Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br />The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br /><br />The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.<br />And mamma in her â€˜kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />Had just settled our brains for a long winterâ€™s nap.<br /><br />When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br /><br />The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br />Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br />When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.<br /><br />With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br />More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br /><br />&quot;Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br />On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!<br />To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br />Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!&quot;<br /><br />As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br />So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br />With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.<br /><br />And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.<br /><br />He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br />A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br />And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.<br /><br />His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br />His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br /><br />The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br />He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br />That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br /><br />He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br />A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br /><br />He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br />And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!<br /><br />He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br />But I heard him exclaim, â€˜ere he drove out of sight,<br />&quot;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!&quot; <br />

					I am a centrist. &nbsp;I would Never vote for Jose Peralta or Monserrate so please don&#039;t depict me as anything other than a person with an opinion. I respect evryones right to post what they want.&nbsp; It is not fair to peg me one way or the other for my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to say that everyone has been bashing Monserrate, OK, I&#039;m fine with that, but Peralta is another useless pail of S--t! &nbsp;When the first Tribune article hit I read the posts ALL GIVING HIM (JOSE) THE BENEIFIT OF THE DOUBT, WELL NOW THE TRIBUNE BREAKS LOTS OF NEGATIVES ABOUT JOSE ALSO. &nbsp;I don&#039;t see the concern about these serious allegations. &nbsp;Double standard? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;Accepatable? No Way.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In sum, I don&#039;t trust that either party serves the interest of the people, but I would vote for a candidate irrespective of party. &nbsp;We can do better than either one of theses characters. &nbsp;Lets find a new candidate to vote for. &nbsp;I want to support someone with integrity and I am open to suggestions. &nbsp;Well Jackson Heights who else???

					Well folks here we go again.&nbsp; <br />Now the Queens Tribune on a front page story reports that good ole JOSE PERALTA might not have been as honest as he originally stated.&nbsp; The FACTS are that he illegally reported campaign contributions as donations from his mother!!&nbsp; Thats right the idiot put his mother in the middle of a corruption scandal.&nbsp; You see both Jose&#039;s camapign office and his not for profit are in the same buliding the not for profit with our tax dollars paid rent to Ms. Mota who by the way lives with his mother Ms. Hernandez.&nbsp; Ms. Mota in turn gave Jose free rent on his campaign office!!!&nbsp; Hmmmmm. Quid Pro Quo??&nbsp; I think an arrest is iminent.&nbsp; Read the facts folks&nbsp; Just the facts.&nbsp; Me thinks we need a new turd, this one (Jose) smells too bad!<br /><br /><strong>From Today&#039;s Queens Tribune</strong><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><strong>False Report:<br />Peralta Got $17,900 In Excess Funds,<br />Admits To Bad Election Filings</strong></div><br />By Kaitlyn Kilmetis<br /><br /><br />Assemblyman Jose Peralta (D-Corona) admitted this week that he filed donations for his previous Assembly runs inaccurately, and has been working to clear up the records. <br /><br />Between 2005 and 2006, Peralta listed some 23 donations for $1,300 apiece as coming from his mother, Rosa Hernandez, who works as an office manager for a family friend, Mercedes Mota-Martinez. <br /><br />104-01 Roosevelt Realty, an LLC owned by Mota-Martinez, owns the building at 104-01 Roosevelt Ave., where Peraltaâ€™s campaign is headquartered. The donations were not Hernandezâ€™s to make as the space being donated belongs to the LLC.<br /><br />The difference between a donation made by a family member and anyone else is extreme â€“ private individuals and corporations are limited to $3,800 in donations for the primary and general elections, while family member donations are figured out by a formula; the max is never less than $12,500 for both the primary and general elections. <br /><br />Peralta received $29,900 in donations originally tagged as from his mother over the course of two campaign cycles â€“ for the 2004 and 2006 campaigns. <br /><br />As a result, Peraltaâ€™s campaign was able to receive $17,900 more than what the law allows. Peralta admitted in a conversation this week that his campaign filings were incorrect, but was unavailable to answer later questions, specifically, if he had listed the filings under his motherâ€™s name as a way to skirt around the donation limits established by the Board of Elections. <br /><br />A spokesman later said his mother was listed as the donor because she sits on the board of directors for the LLC. The spokesman said this was â€œan honest mistakeâ€ and that as of Dec. 11 the LLC has been reimbursed the $17,900 and that the amended filing has been recorded and documented. <br /><br />The Board of Elections confirmed that on Dec. 14, Peralta filed a number of amendments to the campaign finance records to switch the donor from his mother to the 104-01 Roosevelt Realty Corporation. As of publication, there are now only eight such donations for a total of $12,000. <br /><br />Peralta said that in the future he will have an election lawyer review all the documents his campaign files.<br /><br />John Conklin, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said filing adjustments years after a campaign is neither typical or atypical. He said making alterations to the records is encouraged because the ultimate goal is accurate filing. <br /><br />In his campaign records from his 2008 election, rather than receive the rent as a donation, Peralta began making cash payments for $1,300. He said although the 104-01 corporation offered to donate the space, he chose to make payments because the election was more relaxed than his 2006 run against Carmen Enriquez. <br /><br />Shared Space <br />The issue of Peraltaâ€™s campaign records was first raised in a New York Daily News article about Peralta and the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development. <br /><br />On Dec. 9, columnist Juan Gonzalez wrote that Peralta requested more than $500,000 in taxpayer funds for a nonprofit organization that is inactive and has been for defunct for at least the past two years. <br /><br />Peralta, who aided in developing the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development early in his Assembly tenure, vehemently disputes the articleâ€™s claims and attempted to set the record straight. <br /><br />The location of the Corona-Elmhurst Center is the same building owned by Mota-Martinezâ€™s LLC, and where Perlataâ€™s campaign office is housed. Peralta, who helped get the group started, said the companyâ€™s CEO found the space on his own and he had no part in determining the location of the Center.<br /><br />At one point, Peralta, Hernandez and Mota-Martinez all lived in the same multi-dwelling home in Corona â€“ Hernandez and Peralta in one apartment and Mota-Martinez in another. Although the Daily News article states the two both currently live together, Peralta said his mother has since moved to a home in East Elmhurst â€“ a dwelling which is co-owned by Mota-Martinez. He said Mota-Martinez still lives in the Corona building. <br /><br />Prior to the Corona-Elmhurst Center taking space in the building, Peralta paid monthly rent of $1,300. During the time that Peraltaâ€™s motherâ€™s business partner benefited from the new rent-paying tenant, the Corona-Elmhurst Center, Perlata was given the in-kind donations. After the Corona-Elmhurst Center moved out, Peralta started paying rent once again. <br /><br />He said the fact he began paying rent had nothing to do with the fact the Corona-Elmhurst Center had shut down.<br /><br />The Money Trail <br />On top of the rental question, a separate issue of the funding for the agency has also been raised. <br /><br />Peralta said in 2003 he was approached by Fernando Fernandez â€“ who had a background in nonprofit organizations with an emphasis on development groups â€“ about his plans for a development center for the area. Peralta said he was attracted to the nonprofit, the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development, because bringing a voice to the small business community was a platform issue throughout his campaign. <br /><br />According to the Assemblyman, after being presented a comprehensive business plan by Fernandez, who was named Executive Director, in 2003 Peralta earmarked $125,000 for the organization to begin. Then, for the next three years, from 2004 through 2006, Peralta secured increments of $125,000 each year for the center, totaling another $375,000. <br /><br />Peralta said the first $250,000 was dispersed successfully by the organization through computer classes, business seminars and a variety of community services.<br /><br />As the organization flourished, Peralta said Fernandez fell ill and required a kidney transplant. In 2006, he approached Peralta and said due to his deteriorating health, he was not sure how effectively he could continue to run the organization. Immediately after, Peralta said he approached the Assemblyâ€™s Ways and Means Committee in order to put a freeze on the $250,000 earmarked in 2005 and 2006.<br /><br />Also, in 2005 U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer secured $250,000 in federal funds for the centerâ€™s development.<br /><br />This week, the Senatorâ€™s spokesman Josh Vlasto said, â€œThe federal money was never drawn down and, as the grant has since expired, we have asked the SBA to redirect the funds.â€<br /><br />In terms of state funding, Peralta maintains that the first $250,000 the state supplied was dispersed and the other $250,000 remains untouched to this day.<br /><br />He added that as an assemblyman his job description includes earmarking the funds, but each assembly project is administered by a state agency. In this case, that agency was the State Dept. of Economic Development.<br /><br />Through a popular non-profit public record clearinghouse, guidestar.org, Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development did not have any tax filings on record.<br /><br />Behind The Scenes <br />Peralta, who is staging a Senate race against Sen. Hiram Monserrate (D-Corona), said he believes the entire Daily News story is a hit piece staged by the Senator to distract from the pertinent issues. <br /><br />â€œThis is a classic smear campaign tactic that needs to end,â€ Peralta said. â€œThis is one of the reasons why I am running.â€ He continued that the pieceâ€™s reporter seems to habitually sing Monserrateâ€™s praises. <br /><br />â€œThe facts speak for themselves,â€ Peralta said. â€œEvery time there was a positive article about Hiram Monserrate in the Daily News it was Juan Gonzalez that wrote it. Let the readers make the judgment.â€<br /><br />Gonzalez declined to respond to Peraltaâ€™s claim.<br /><br />When Monserrateâ€™s office was contacted for comment, one of the Senatorâ€™s staffers answered the phone and said he had already been made aware, via Juan Gonzalez, that the Tribune was investigating the story. <br /><br />Gonzalez would not substantiate that assertion. <br /><br />The employee then introduced the Tribune to the source that had given information to the Daily News â€“ an Elmhurst author, who asked to remain unnamed. He said he has been gathering information about the Peralta situation for the past seven years.<br /><br />He said as an investigative journalist he researches the campaigns and actions of many Queens officials as a service to his community. The author assured he had no link to Monserrate and investigates all borough politicians.<br /><br />Upon further research, it was ascertained that through personal contributions and donations from businesses the author operates, the unnamed source contributed large amounts to the campaign of Peraltaâ€™s 2006 opponent Carmen Enriquez. Campaign finance records also list the source and Enriquez as having the same address, including apartment number.<br /><br />Enriquezâ€™ campaign spending reports state that the unnamed source and the businesses he owns received a total of $600, in consulting, printing and office space fees, from the 2006 campaign. <br />

					I was emailed this link which shows a picture of the signage of a store front not-for-profit in Corona which is the at the center of the controversy with Assemblyman Jose Peralta. &nbsp;I asked my friend who is an accountant and he says that it is a violation of IRS regulations to have an elected officials name on a sign of a not for profit, even if that politician gave $125,000. &nbsp;It would be deemed political. &nbsp;This blog has more facts than the Daily News. &nbsp;Read it folks, you be the judge.<br /><br /><a href="http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2009/12/hirams-replacement-is-no-angel-either.html#links" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queenscrap.blogspot.com/2009/12/hirams-replacement-is-no-angel-either.html#links</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; Similar topics merged]</strong>

					I don&#039;t read Spanish but I will look into it.&nbsp; I saw an NY Observer blog statement by another Senator who stated that Peralta should not throw stones when there is an investigation of his malfeasance with public monies.&nbsp; I was also told ch. 2 ran the story but I could not verify&nbsp; Good night.
