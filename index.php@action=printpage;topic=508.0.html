				Over the years, I&#039;ve noticed that new generations of movie goers are not being introduced to the cinema of yesteryear.&nbsp; How is it possible that a 20 or 30 something year old person may never have heard of David Niven, Jimmy Stewart or Bette Davis?&nbsp; Many of today&#039;s movies, arguably digital and technical masterpieces, tend to be focused more on visual effects rather than storyline.&nbsp; Has film noir lost its appeal in today&#039;s movie going market?&nbsp; Films like Mildred Pierce, All About Eve, Casa Blanca, The Maltese Falcon, and Key Largo, to name a few, are just not as popular as they once were.&nbsp; I still laugh while watching films like The Thin Man, Topper or My Man Godfrey, and am grateful that museums like The Museum of the Moving Image still holds screenings for vintage movies and more.&nbsp; On a similar note, why do I have to travel to Manhattan or Long Island to watch a screening of The Kite Runner or a highly regarded independent movie?&nbsp; The Kew Gardens Cinemas located here in Queens has been successfully screening non-mainstream, non-blockbuster type films.<br /><br />Having said all of the above, I sometimes wonder how successful something like this would be in our community.&nbsp; The Natives theater is not too far removed from the era when Hollywood movies were being shown there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also thought that smaller screenings at the Jewish Center, perhaps as fund raisers, could be popular, but then legal questions arise re: admittance fees, etc., and equipment costs would be expensive.<br /><br />http://www.kewgardenstheatre.com/index.html<br /><br />Anyone have any thoughts on the above?
