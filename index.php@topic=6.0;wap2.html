			Is there a Mexican grocery in the neighborhood that sells Mexican or Mayan cocoa powder?&nbsp; I think the kind I&#039;m looking for has cinnamon and perhaps chiles and maybe even hazelnut in it.

			I can&#039;t speak to that specific ingredient, but you might want to try the Panaderia Coatzingo, near 76th &amp; Roosevelt.

			I tried Coatzingo, and while it smelled amazing in there from all the freshly baked goods, they did not have the kind of cocoa powder I was looking for.&nbsp; They had several kinds, including one that looked almost right, but it had sugar in it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Next I will try Trade Fair as I&#039;ve learned there is always something for sale there that you&#039;re not really expecting.<br /><br />Also I recall seeing some Mexican groceries on 37th Ave down towards Corona so maybe I will make a trek up there one of these days.<br /><br />Does anyone know how to say Mexican powdered cocoa (with no sugar) in Spanish?
