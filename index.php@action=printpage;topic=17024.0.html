				Joyce45, thank you for raising this issue. I think it&#039;s as serious as any in the neighborhood and needs to be tackled with real action by us -- area residents.<br /><br />I&#039;m a relative newcomer to the area and I have been really disturbed by how trash laden these blocks are, so I&#039;d like to suggest the following:<br /><br />--There is a merchants association that represents the businesses on this street and we ought to be in contact with them. I will try to dig up the contact info. The person in charge of it recently attended a community meeting set up to discuss policing issues and as an aside mentioned that the merchants are being unfairly blamed for trash because people come from other nabes and dump there. I think that&#039;s patently untrue. I walk by the big fruit and vegetable market in 74th each morning and I&#039;m convinced they rarely sweep their sidewalk. <br />--A group of us should get together and contact our local officials in an organized way.<br />--We also should attend the local community board meetings and take another step. There is a member of the community board responsible for sanitation issues and that person ought to be contacted too.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed is whenever the issue of street clutter and illegal vendors is mentioned there&#039;s a large group of folks who contend that this is part of the charm of JH and people like us are criticized as folks who want to turn JH in to the Upper East Side. No way that&#039;s true. There is nothing ``charming&#039;&#039; about having some of the dirtiest streets around.<br /><br />Maybe we could set up a meeting to further discuss.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Technically, building owners are responsible for keeping adjacent sidewalks clear of litter, extending 18&quot; out from the curb into the street. I&#039;m not sure whether I agree that&#039;s fair, but it is true. The NYC Department of Sanitation can issue fines, although obviously they usually don&#039;t. You can make a 311 complaint about chronic littering, which might encourage enforcement.

				Regarding trash cans- it has been discussed here before with many comments on the fact that these garbage cans fill up in a<br />matter of hours and that means you need lot&#039;s of pickups by Dept of Sanitation. Otherwise they look worse that the litter on<br />the streets. In other areas of JH where there are trash cans a fair amount of the trash is from households who have extra<br />tenants or drivers emptying their meals from cars. I think more of the John Doe workers, more fines for businesses, enforcement of street access rules by vendors, more signs and more flowers and plants to show some gives a damn about the look of the area.<br /><br />The businesses on 73rd and 74th clearly have some exemptions from street cleaning. Some of the sidewalks are<br />black with grease. And the street vendors are out of control leaning their tables and wares against the street trees- the few<br />of these trees that survive these streets. I am in this area frequently and shop/eat at a number of the establishments so I<br />am interested in them doing well, but standards and enforcement in this area are not enforced which is repelling a lot of <br />residents and for the businesses, more potential customers who see the area as super dirty.<br /><br />&nbsp;There is a group of local people organized already which is under the umbrella Friends of Diversity Plaza. Contact them for<br />more info.

				I believe trash is an issue all over NYC.<br /><br />In other neighborhoods with commercial litter/garbage issues private contractors are used to remove trash daily.<br /><br />That is the only real valid solution.<br /><br />To pay for a daily, or twice daily if necessary, private service.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Ultimately the behavior of people who litter needs to be changed. Dozens of times have I seen people on 73rd and 74th or adjacent blocks just throw tea cups, whole dunkin donuts bags, chicken and rice containers, etc in a tree pit, under a car, or in front of someone&#039;s building without a care. I&#039;ve had some angry confrontations with people about it and in most cases they pick it up, but they often give attitude. I don&#039;t bother any more because it seems insurmountable and I don&#039;t need the stress in my life.

				Thanks for all the helpful and insightful responses. I don&#039;t really think we need to address culture or comparisons from other neighborhoods in Manhattan. I&#039;ve lived and visited many metropolitan cities within the US and globally and it varies. The situation here is pretty bad. <br /><br />I did call 311 and file a complaint of chronic littering and left a message with the councilman. I was told by his office that they use private funds to do one pick up a day already. Not sure about this. I agree about the trash cans not being adequate. Helpful to know that there used to be more. <br /><br />I researched this online. It would be helpful to be included in getting new trash cans as one step. Especially, given we are at crossroads of transportation and at &quot;Diversity Plaza&quot;. The neighborhood needs to be cleaner. <br /><br />http://sunnysidepost.com/van-bramer-allocates-60k-for-trash-cans-27-coming-to-sunnyside<br /><br />http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/508-17/mayor-de-blasio-start-diversity-plaza-construction-jackson-heights<br /><br />I like the idea about the article addressing the issue. I will also contact friends of diversity plaza. If everyone who is concerned and tell their neighbors and file complaints with 311 and call Councilman Dromm for assistance in solutions, fines, trashcans, speaking to business owners, policing, 718-803-6373<br /><br />I will reach out to those who mentioned solutions and connections.

				I think rather than each of us contacting 311 and the Dromm and others we put together a letter from a ``group of concerned citizens&#039;&#039; to start this dialogue and form an informal group to keep the pressure on. Perhaps we could arrange a brief meeting somewhere in the nabe to discuss how to approach also this as well. I really think it has to be a group effort -- the more folks who are pressuring on this the more seriously it will be taken. One-off calls don&#039;t work.<br /><br />My plan is to photograph the streets periodically to offer proof of how terrible they are. I&#039;ll start with shots at 7am, when I walk to the train. I often wonder how the storefront sidewalks could be so trash-laden at that hour given most of the shops are closed. My guess is that no one sweeps up before they close. Or very few do.<br /><br /><br />

				Several weeks ago on 74 street I saw a tree surround filled with cooked food. I wanted to post a picture of it but didn&#039;t have the know how.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no idea who put it there, but it looked like it might have been form one of the restaurants. I reported it to 311.&nbsp; The litter problem isn&#039;t confined to 73 and 74 streets, (although I must admit that at times it seems the filthiest.).&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve called Dromm&#039;s office about this and about the countless flyers taped to the lamp posts advertising rooms for rent along 37th avenue.&nbsp; I do think there is powers in numbers and if everyone voices their complaints to his office and to 311 that they will eventually have to do something.&nbsp; Thanks to anyone who is doing this.

I see him all the time. I wish there was a law against public spitting. It is quite disgusting. I witness a man blow a snot rocket from his nose yesterday on 37th avenue. It is so nasty!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It IS against the law to spit on the sidewalk. It is a public health law to stop the spread of worms. Maybe a 19th century law. They taught that in grammar school.<br />[/quote]
