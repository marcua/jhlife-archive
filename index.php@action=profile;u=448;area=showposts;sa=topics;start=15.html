					Good afternoon to all of you and happy 2014 !!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />Have you considered registering your child to art classes? If so, why not do it NOW? ART FOR A START Spring semester is starting this week!!! Attached is the class schedule.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries you may have.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Yours,<br />Deborah<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartnyc.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.artforastartnyc.com</a><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I recently read an article in the NYTimes entitled: Art Makes You Smart <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0</a>) and I could not agree more.&nbsp; Working as an art educator for over fifteen years, I&nbsp; witnessed how exposure to art has contributed to the overall well being of my students and to their mental, verbal and creative development. Having tutored art students for high schools and universities, it&#039;s evident that the development of drawing capabilities and design tools from an early age is invaluable.&nbsp; My arts program is Inquiry-based, no crafty and cookie-cutter projects, no rigid emphasis on techniques. The curriculum emphasizes&nbsp; explorations, skill building, creativity and experimentation. My life&#039;s mission is to share my passion for the arts through my artwork and teaching. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />ART FOR A START 2014 SPRING SEMESTER<br />&nbsp;<br />*Spring Semester starts on January 7th and will end on June 25th.<br />&nbsp;<br />All regular classes are one hour long and the fee is $15.00 per class, including materials. We create a thematic and well-planned curriculum and send weekly emails informing parents about our plan for the week. Subjects to explore throughout the year:<br />&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in drawings<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in painting<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Collage techniques<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sculpture and 3-d<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watercolors<br />&nbsp;<br />All classes are taught by artist and educator Deborah Wasserman. Our program is considered by many as exceptional, and we have students who are now registering for their third year.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Regular weekly classes<br />Art for a Start offers four sessions per week at P.S. 69<br />(37th Avenue between 77th and 78th Street):<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wednesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM.<br />&nbsp;<br />The 4:00PM classes are geared towards younger students (ages 5-7) and the 5:00PM classes are geared towards older students (ages 7-9). If your child&#039;s schedule cannot accommodate these particular age groups, we suggest that you still take one or two trial classes, as many students end up thriving with younger/older peers.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Students can take up to two trial classes before you make a full commitment for one semester. Trial classes are paid classes.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Fees: We require a first month and last month payment for each semester when registering plus a $10.00 registration fee. The last month payment covers the fee for the month on which the semester ends.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the program before it ends, you will lose your last month payment. We are open to make exceptions to this rule in the case of an emergency or any unplanned circumstances.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Enrollment is capped at 10 students per class. Keeping our classes small allows us to give more personal attention to each student.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Make up classes are available. Tuesdays and Wednesdays classes are very similar in age and content.&nbsp; You are welcome to bring your child to any of these classes if he or she missed their regular class. <br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes - A walk from Sunnyside!<br />Saturday classes take place at Mondo Studios in Woodside<br />(33-55 55th Street between 37th Ave. and Broadway, one block from the M/R Northern Blvd subway station).<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:00AM-11:00PM<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11:00:00-12:00 - Private class, not available <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12:00 to 1:00PM<br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes are one hour long, specialized lessons with no more than five students per class.

					Hello folks,<br /><br />ART for a START, the visual arts program in Jackson Heights, is&nbsp; now registering for the fall semester. We serve kids, young adults and adults, ages 3-20.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Last year we had more than 45 students attending our program on a weekly basis. We offer high quality art classes while encouraging: Creativity, expression, imagination and skill building. Classes are divided into age groups and take place at P.S. 69 and in student&#039;s homes.&nbsp; We also offer private classes on weekends, at Mondo Mundo Studios in Woodside.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Check out some of our student&#039;s work from last year&#039;s Queensboro Bridge Art Contest (<a href="http://www.licartsopen.org/?page_id=262" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.licartsopen.org/?page_id=262</a>).&nbsp; We have one child winning or receiving an honorable mention in each and every age group.&nbsp; <br />More images of student&#039;s work can be found on our web site.<br /><br />Please take a minute to read the info below, or check out our web site <br />for the fall schedule at: <a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.artforastartny.com</a>.<br /><br />If you choose to register, contact us directly at: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a> <br />or send us an email via ART for a START web site.<br /><br />Looking forward to another successful year!<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Fall Semester:<br /><br />Fall Semester will start in the beginning of October and will until the end of December.&nbsp; Spring Semester will start in January and end in June.&nbsp; <br />Classes are one hour long (except for the Saturday teen class).&nbsp; <br />We send weekly emails with the plan/curriculum for the week.&nbsp; <br /><br />Registration (Please read. We have made some changes):&nbsp; <br /><br />1. Everyone can take up to two trial classes before making a full commitment. Trial classes are paid classes. <br /><br />2. This year we will require a deposit for each semester and that deposit will cover the last month of each semester.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the program before the end of the semester, you will lose your deposit. We are open to make exceptions to this rule in the case of an emergency or any unplanned circumstances. <br /><br />3. In this up and coming Fall Semester we will limit the classes to no more than 10 kids.&nbsp; This way we will give more personal attention to each student.<br /><br />4. This year we are also offering a special class for students who show an exceptional talent in the arts. We invite students ages 5-8 to join this class, based on their performance in last year&#039;s class and this year.&nbsp; <br /><br />5. We run the Tuesdays and Wednesday classes from P.S. 69. The Friday toddler&#039;s class from one of the student&#039;s home. Private classes run on Saturdays at our Woodside Studio. <br /><br />6. Make up classes: Tuesdays and Wednesdays classes are very similar in age and content.&nbsp; You are welcome to bring your child to any of these classes if he or she missed her regular class.&nbsp; At this moment we can&#039;t offer a make up class for the toddler&#039;s class.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; This year the P.S. 69 classes will start on the hour: 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM - 6:00PM. Thursday toddler&#039;s class will start at 3:15PM. <br /><br />6.&nbsp; Schedule is still subject to change, depending on enrollment. <br /><br /><br />Fall Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now offering two classes on Tuesdays:<br />&nbsp;4:00PM-5:00PM, Ages 7-8 Location: P.S. 69.

Please contact us if interested in this class.<br /><br />About ART for a START:<br /><br /><br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (P.S. 69) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children and adults for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum, Rotunda Gallery, The College of New Jersey) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br /><br />Deborah Wasserman&#039;s biography:<br /><br />Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and raised in Israel, Deborah Wasserman is currently living and working in Queens, NY.&nbsp; She is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program with a Masters and a Post Masters degree.&nbsp; Deborah Wasserman has received grants from the Experimental Television Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Aljira Center for the Arts and the America-Israel cultural foundation. Her work has been exhibited in the USA, Brazil, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel, in such venues as The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Tel Aviv Museum of the Arts, The World Wide Video Festival, White Columns, Gale Gates Gallery, GenArt and A.I.R gallery.<br /><br /><br />To see my teaching resume, please go to my we site at:<br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for choosing ART for a START!<br />We are very excited to work with you once again!<br /><br /><br />Deborah<br /><br />ART for a START<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.artforastartny.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.deborahwasserman.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.deborahwasserman.com</a><br />Contact me at: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

					Hello everyone!<br />&nbsp;<br />First of all I am delighted to share with you that four of our ART for a START students have won an award or a mention at the Queensboro Bridge art contest at L.I.C. Open. There were total of about sixteen kids who won an award and there were HUNDREDS of entries. <br />&nbsp;<br />Since we launched ART for a START in October we had a wonderful year of creativity and skill building with over 40 students enrolled (ages 3-20). All of ART for a START classes will end in June and will resume classes in mid September 2011.&nbsp; Registration will start in the beginning of August.<br />&nbsp;<br />We will be offering, however, an exclusive Sumi Workshop in our Woodside studio for three consecutive Saturdays in July:<br />&nbsp;<br />What is Sumi Painting? Sumi Ink and wash painting is an East Asian type of brush &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_brush&gt;&nbsp; painting &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting&gt;&nbsp; also known as wash painting or by its Japanese name sui-boku-ga.&nbsp; On a spiritual level, Sumi attempts to capture the spirit of nature with ease and flow, while depicting landscapes or still life.&nbsp; On a technical level, the artist must work with confidence and ease while applying ink unto rice paper.&nbsp; Itâ€™s a very precise and yet improvised technique, which teaches concentration and â€˜Going with the flowâ€™ at once. Itâ€™s like meditation!!! I have been â€˜testingâ€™ these workshops with my older students (8-13 years old) and they all fell in love with it (not to mention that the results are beautiful and SO rewarding!). <br />&nbsp;<br />This three weeks course will consist of:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. A short background, Power Point presentation, explaining and introducing the art of Sumi.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Enhancing drawing skills in order to train the hand-eye coordination in order to perform quick sketches with ink. <br />&nbsp;<br />3. Sumi wash paintings on traditional rice paper with ink and Sumi brushes (all materials are non toxic).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Information about Sumi Classes:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Classes will consist of no more that 6 students at a time (I will group them by age) and will be 1.5 hours long. They will take place in our Woodside studio (55th Street between 37th Ave and Broadway). Dates for classes: Saturdays: July 5th, July9th and July 15th.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Ages: 7 and up. The price per class will be $25 and that includes materials.&nbsp; Classes will be offered in the morning time (9:30AM-11:00AM, 11:00AM â€“ 12:30PM depending on enrollment). Registration fee is required which will go towards the last class.&nbsp; &nbsp;The total for this three weeks workshop will be $75.00.&nbsp; <br />I am offering siblings discount, and a special discount for currently enrolled ART for a START students.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. We may decide to add a field trip in the end of the class to Asia Society so we can examine original Sumi paintings. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />If interested, please get in touch with me via my web site (listed below) . I will be happy to send you images of my studentâ€™s work.&nbsp; I posted one on my web site under â€˜class schedule/Pricingâ€™.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you!<br /><br />Deborah Wasserman<br />ART for a START<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.artforastartny.com</a>

Sumi Ink and wash painting is an East Asian type of brush &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_brush&gt; &nbsp;painting &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting&gt; &nbsp;also known as wash painting or by its Japanese name sui-boku-ga. &nbsp;On a spiritual level, Sumi attempts to capture the spirit of nature with ease and flow, while depicting landscapes or still life. &nbsp;On a technical level, the artist must work with confidence and ease while applying ink unto rice paper. &nbsp;Itâ€™s a very precise and yet improvised technique, which teaches concentration and â€˜Going with the flowâ€™ at once. Itâ€™s like meditation!!! I have been â€˜testingâ€™ these workshops with my older students (8-13 years old) and they all fell in love with it (not to mention that the results are beautiful and SO rewarding!). <br />&nbsp;<br />This three weeks course will consist of:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. A short background, Power Point presentation, explaining and introducing the art of Sumi.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Enhancing drawing skills in order to train the hand-eye coordination in order to perform quick sketches with ink. <br />&nbsp;<br />3. Sumi wash paintings on traditional rice paper with ink and Sumi brushes (all materials are non toxic).<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Information about Sumi Classes:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Classes will consist of no more that 6 students at a time (I will group them by age) and will be 1.5 hours long. They will take place in our Woodside studio (55th Street between 37th Ave and Broadway). Dates for classes: Saturdays: July 5th, July9th and July 15th.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Ages: 7 and up. The price per class will be $25 and that includes materials. &nbsp;Classes will be offered in the morning time (9:30AM-11:00AM, 11:00AM â€“ 12:30PM depending on enrollment). Registration fee is required which will go towards the last class. &nbsp; The total for this three weeks workshop will be $75.00. &nbsp;<br />I am offering siblings discount, and a special discount for currently enrolled ART for a START students.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. We may decide to add a field trip in the end of the class to Asia Society so we can examine original Sumi paintings. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />If interested, please get in touch with me via my web site (listed below) . I will be happy to send you images of my studentâ€™s work. &nbsp;I posted one on my web site under â€˜class schedule/Pricingâ€™.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you!<br /><br />Deborah Wasserman<br />ART for a START<br /><a href="http://www.artforastartny.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.artforastartny.com</a>

					Hello folks,<br />&nbsp;<br />Good news! The very much awaited art classes are here! <br />I would love to hear from you if you are interested in in enrolling your child, if the hours work for you etc...I will follow shortly with additional information, web site and precise starting date. <br />&nbsp;<br />Background:<br />&nbsp;<br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (The Jewish Center) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br />&nbsp; <br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br />&nbsp; <br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br />&nbsp; <br />Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will start in October.&nbsp; They will run parallel to the public school schedule. Additional classes may be offered during the holidays while the kidâ€™s ore out of school.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will run Mon-Thursday. Length of classes: 1 hour&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. After School: 2 classes each afternoon: 3:15-4:15, or 4:30-5:30. Classes are divided into ages:&nbsp; 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 <br />&nbsp;2. Morning Toddlers (with parents or nannies), ages 3-4: 10:00AM-11:00AM, 11:15AM to 12:15AM. <br />&nbsp; <br />Subjects to explore throughout the year: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1.
