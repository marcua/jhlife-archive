				Sounds like Starbucks is about to become a done deal.&nbsp; Now for my pet peeve:&nbsp; I like living in JH more or less but&nbsp; am ashamed that I live in a neighborhood without a bookstore of any description.&nbsp; There used to be a sort of bookstore / internet cafe on 37th a few years ago but it closed to make way for (gack!) a check cashing place.&nbsp; Check cashers, 99 cent stores, trashy clothing stores, unhygenic bodegas all bespeak neighborhood blight in a big way I believe, and must be a dis-incentive to many professional people,&nbsp; prospective co-op buyers, who are trying to escape the stratospheric prices in Manhattan and Park Slope.&nbsp; Some of them buy in anyway in the hope that the demographic will change.&nbsp; I once wrote to the real estate division of Barnes &amp; Noble notifying them of available storefronts in this neighborhood. Although I got a nice email back that they would look into it, nothing since.&nbsp; Anyone have contacts with B&amp;N, Borders etc. who could put in a word for a bookstore? It could have a sizeable section for Spanish-speakers and host bi-lingual readings and book signings to attract the current demographic.&nbsp; Any ideas folks?

				Lesley, I totally agree!&nbsp; We moved out here hoping to see a progression in the neighborhood and unfortunately more trashy stores and (oh the horror!) that ceedy new &quot;romantic lounge&quot; opened instead.&nbsp; I do have to say that I was happy that we now have Fresh Direct AND the health food store on 37th is awesome!&nbsp; But a bookstore is desperately needed.

				Lesley,<br /><br />I also wrote to B&amp;N a couple months ago and got the some response as you did. I told them about the North Fork location on 37th Ave that would be perfect for a small store.&nbsp; However this was right before the news broke that they are closing the Astor Place and 6th ave/22nd street locations in Manhattan. I guess even for the big boys, bookstores are hard to make money in the days of the internet. However, on the weekends I can suggest jumping on the E or F one stop to Forest Hills and there is a B&amp;N there.&nbsp; Its not so great for those of us who might want to go the bookstore on the way home from work. But I went yesterday, and the train ride was nothing.<br /><br />D

				Nonetheless bookstores that offer seating, refreshments and live readings and book signings provide an attractive ambience that continues to draw people in. I think B&amp;N has just saturated its own market - the one on 6th and 22nd isn&#039;t that necessary given that there is one at Union Square.<br /><br />When I lived in Park Slope I was less likely to travel outside the neighborhood on the weekends because everything I could possibly want - bookstores (more than one), quality shops, great restaurants etc. etc. were all there just a walk up the block.&nbsp; Now, in JH, why would I travel to Forest Hills just to go to a bookstore when I might as well just go into Manhattan (or back to the Slope for that matter) for the quality I seek?&nbsp; By the way, that C-Town is such a trash heap and Met is only marginally better so we often find ourselves shopping even for groceries in Manhattan - Whole Foods and the farmers market.&nbsp; Nice to hear we have Fresh Direct now.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried them yet.&nbsp; How is their produce (and prices)?

				A book store of the B&amp;N or Borders variety is a bit of a reach for Jackson Heights at this time. Our nabe suffers from a serious lack of quality and/or brand-name retail stores. We need to help usher in more small-box retailers to 37th ave such as Victoria&#039;s Secret, Bath &amp; Body Works, Gap, etc. before we stand a chance to land a big-box store such as Borders.

				Why do people insist on having another commercial name store to take away the flavor of JH?&nbsp; Why not a mom and pop book store? There used to be nice little bookstore on 77th store close to 15 years ago. It wasn&#039;t the greatest place but the owner&#039;s knew the people of the community. I practically grew up with them and would say hi to them years later after I moved out of the area. What people really want is a bookstore so they can sit down and relax. Queensboro public library is also a nice place (with the best circulation).

				An independent would be great but, unfortunately, the reality of the book business is that it&#039;s very (very very) difficult for an independent to compete on price with the chain and online stores.

				The problem here is two-fold.<br /><br />1) Barnes &amp; Noble is picky and requires a large property to open a store, this is not readily available because they want to operate on a highl trafficked retail strip.<br /><br />2) The literacy level in Jackson Heights is not in line with high sales for Barnes &amp; Noble.&nbsp; While there are educated people here, there are not enough for Barnes &amp; Noble to be successful.

				&nbsp;::) hidden away is one of the only remaining bookstore I know about that is not a stand on the street - most of the books are in spanish - if you tend towards the &quot;esoteric&quot; you will find some hard to find titles - it&#039;s about a block from the new bus terminal on 74th street and Roosvelt avenue - going towards 75th street - you can&#039;t miss it as they advertise being able to photograph and analyze your aura.<br /><br />can&#039;t speak to the aura but the book selection is pretty varied - check it out

				I just got an email from another group list about a possible bookstore location in JH, and I got permission from the person who sent it to re-post it here.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; . . the following wasn&#039;t written by me, it was written by someone else:<br /><br />I hope that everyone is enjoying their holiday season.&nbsp; I wanted to let people know about a space that has become available in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I know in previous list serve postings, people have been craving a &quot;bookstore&quot;, a gourmet food store, etc.&nbsp; The biggest stumbling block has seemed to be the high rental costs in the neighborhood, especially 37th avenue.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />There is a space on Northern Boulevard, between 80th and 81st street that is now available.&nbsp; It used to be a used furniture store. I spoke with the managing agent and he is hoping to fill the space with a neighborhood friendly tenant that reflects the needs of the community. His two dream tenets are either a bookstore or an Italian deli.&nbsp; He is aware of the high rent issues in Jackson Heights and says that in addition to Northern Boulevard&#039;s competitive rental rates, he would be willing to negotiate a more favorable deal with the &quot;right tenant&quot;.&nbsp; He mentioned that he already has a few serious inquires so calling him soon is critical.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have an entrepreneurial spirit please give Hal a call on his cellphone:&nbsp; 845-304-7620.&nbsp; Tell him you heard about the space from Braden and here&#039;s hoping that there will be a new establishment coming soon that will support the ever growing needs of our diverse community!

				I surely don&#039;t think a B&amp;N or Borders will do well in JH. When we live in East Village, we never buy from them. We&#039;d go to St. Marks Bookstore instead or buy online. There&#039;s no love of literature in B&amp;N or Borders. The people who want them here - do you just want to browse books for free? They are the McDonald&#039;s of bookstore.

And while those stores and Amazon have made it really difficult for independents to compete--and I have a huge problem with that--they&#039;ve also made bookstores much more accessible to a wider population. B&amp;N and Borders are by no means my favorite bookstores but they&#039;re not the devil they&#039;re often made out to be.

They may not have that rare book you&#039;ve been searching for for years or that wonderful feel of a tiny well-run independent and you really probably won&#039;t ever be on a first-name basis with any of the booksellers but they offer a good broad range of titles.

				I would definitely love more variety in the businesses in the area -- without, of course, completely losing the neighborhood charm. But I&#039;ve also heard that the rents for commercial real estate properties in the neighborhood have totally skyrocketed and that may make it really hard for an independent anything to open.

				I don&#039;t doubt that commercial rents are skyrocketing.<br /><br />So I have to admit that I was a bit surprised that there&#039;s that new beauty salon opening up on 37th Ave., next to where the Starbucks is going to be.<br /><br />But then again, I guess beauty salons can be quite lucrative.<br /><br />It&#039;s just that there are already so many, I&#039;d imagine it would take a lot of gusto to open up yet another business in which there is already so much competition.<br /><br />But then again, I guess there&#039;s a lot of demand, also.&nbsp;

Also , one has to take in consideration that that demographics in the Historical District is for the most part is different than the rest of the neighborhood. An example is that there are more English speaking residents and college grads for the most part in this section of the neighborhood . Therefore, the needs are different , which, is also the reason that the retail scene is trying to assimilate itself to the current need of this part of Jackson Heights. But, I believe that a Barnes &amp; Noble or a Borders will do great here . Because,the neighborhood has a huge amount of young families and professionals , the less we have to buy away from Jackson Heights the better , also, they can include a well stocked Spanish section and I am 100% positive it the sales will be outstanding . ;D So lets keep our fingers crossed&nbsp; ;D

				I buy the essentials in Jackson heights, but, not too much else. Occasionally I buy stuff from the office supplies store (not lately), and even more rarely clothing/shoes. It&#039;s an interesting point that English speaking persons are not adequately represented. I really do think a B @ N will do well here.

She loved them too much. Writing book-jacket copy from a cubicle, sorting files, â€œI felt so far from the things we were making,â€ she recalled.<br /><br />Longing for the part-time job she had in college, at Three Lives, an independent bookstore in the West Village, Ms. Stockton Bagnulo returned to working there on weekends to cheer herself up. At some point she realized that graduate school in creative writing was not the answer (which was good, because she didnâ€™t get in anywhere). â€œGradually,â€ she said, â€œit dawned on me that the big, important thing I wanted to do was open a bookstore.â€<br /><br />(Follow link for complete article)

				It would help me a lot if there was a bookstore in JH! I wouldn&#039;t have to trek to Forrest Hills for the classics by Hemingway or James Joyce.<br /><br />The only option for buying used books and used classics in JH is the mysterious vendor who sets up shop outside of Met Foods on 37th ave with 76st...actually, you can see him if you go to google maps and use the street view option.&nbsp; I believe him and and the local public library will be your only competition.

				Years and years ago, there was a used bookstore that also carried new books across from PS 69.&nbsp; Most of us kids then called it the comic shop, as it had all the books you&#039;d want in the early 80s.&nbsp; Eventually it went under though, but at time it had quite a following.<br /><br />I seem to recall a smaller bookstore on 37th between 82nd and 83rd, where I bought my Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator when I was like 8, but it may have been a combo book/card shop?&nbsp; Not to be confused with the Hallmark on the same stretch back then (one of the few stores that survived the mysterious fire that eventually lead to the present building complex ...)

				Yes I had forgetten that one .. only went out recently, last few years.&nbsp; I remember the big $2 clearance sale.<br /><br />Speaking of competition, the library is more competition than you may realize.&nbsp; Often, rather than process their many donations (unless, like me, you tell them direct &quot;this is new, I bought it, read it, its yours&quot; they simply put in &#039;up for grabs&#039; boxes by the starway to the childrens room.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gotten a few kids DVDs this way ... they rather people take them then register them.<br /><br />They also biyearly sales in the basement ... we get tons of books there yearly.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve got a very busy and avid reader at home.)

				Are you kidding me? I dropped off a few bags of children&#039;s books like a year ago because I thought it would be great to go to others who could use them. I guess if some kids got them, thats great, but they would get more use if they could be borrowed over and over. Oh well.<br /><br />I should have kept the books...sold them in my bookstore&nbsp; :laugh:<br /><br />If I had a store with both used and new books, maybe I would offer some sort of compensation for book donations. That will kill the library competition. That might sound a little mean now that I reread it, but the library will always be necessary for reference material and the other variety of services they offer. <br /><br />As for the used book seller on 37th in front of Met, I would make him come work with me! I would not want to hurt his sales so maybe we could team up.&nbsp;

				If you&#039;re willing to offer some compensation for used books, why not offer it as a credit that can be used towards a purchase in the store?&nbsp; I would be ok with that and you would increase sales as a result!

				Yeah.&nbsp; I was really sorry to see that bookstore on 37th fail.&nbsp; I kicked myself for every trip that I had taken to the Strand after a meeting downtown, and wished that I had given my business to members of the community.&nbsp; The store actually had a bit of a &quot;Strandish&quot; feel... sort of chaotic feel, and you could dig around as if you were on a treasure hunt, and always be surprised at what you would find.&nbsp; But if you went in looking for something specific, and not even obscure, you might not find it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would also LOVE to see a great independent bookstore here in JH.&nbsp; But it is a tough business.&nbsp; Rents anywhere near foot-traffic are outrageously high, and you need to make an enormous investment in inventory before you can even open the door.&nbsp; I agree with the posters who have said that trying to be all things to all people might spell disaster.&nbsp; But JH is soooo diverse, that no matter what focus you decide on, you will be excluding a large percentage of the population.&nbsp; <br /><br />But keep us updated.&nbsp; I promise I&#039;ll spend some money in a local bookstore with just about any focus... from coffee table books to children&#039;s books to sci fi or a little Noam Chompsky or some JH trivia or Latin American fiction.&nbsp; Or the French guy who I&#039;ve never heard of who just won the Nobel Prize in literature when his stuff gets translated into English!&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;d love to open a bookstore, but the problem for me would be the issue of having browsers, which of course would be normal, but then how do you pay the rent which is so expensive.&nbsp; The children would come in and read the books as my children always do and then would leave as we do when we go to Barnes and Noble.&nbsp; We have been there for two and three hours just reading every book we can find.&nbsp; Oh, YES WE HAVE, and then walked out with a $10 dollar item.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many mommies and daddies on this site know what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; I would then have to contend with the guy that sells in front of Met food.&nbsp; A dollar a book.&nbsp; I would then have to contend with the adults that just want to hang out and look something up quickly and then run.&nbsp; How would I pay the bills.&nbsp; I would then get nuts, probably nuttier than I already am with all the kids that I have, and have to simply close down.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I was thinking that if those families out there that have a parent who stays at home with the kids and needs the outlet of being in the business world a few hours or days a week, has some capital and wants to invest money and the time, we could form a cooperative bookstore with community residents as shareholders and open up the bookstore and each would take turns with the business, etc.&nbsp; That way there would be different energy, etc. and a group of owners/investors.&nbsp; That would be the perfect idea in the perfect world.&nbsp; JUST A THOUGHT.&nbsp; ANY IDEAS?

				The cooperative idea is a very good one. I talked to someone who was a part of a grocery cooperative in Brooklyn. They all own it, so they all work there for some set of time per week or month. There is also (probably many other) a bookstore I went to downtown called Bluestockings, all the people that work there are volunteers I believe so they get discounts and have a say in the events or whatever. Its a good concept but would take a lot of commitment and organization.

				I am no entrepreneur. In fact, as a union member and soon-to-be home owner, my sympathies and finances are very much committed elsewhere. Still, I think an independent bookstore is essential to any thriving neighborhood. A good bookstore serves more than just books. It serves as a cultural and intellectual center, a meeting place for the curious and a convergence point for the area&#039;s many identities. It can host talks and readings, and serve up local fare. Were there ever plans to open one, I&#039;d love in some way to be a part.<br /><br />That said, what do you think it would take to open and <em>keep open</em> a bookstore in Jackson Heights? Rent is of course the number one obstacle. But what if instead of a single owner, start-up money and resources were pooled together by a half-dozen or so people? Or better yet, as a non-profit neighborhood initiative? Not only would this reduce individual risk, but a wide and representative ownership could better tap into, among others, the many Latino cultures, the south-east Asian communities, and the LGBT community. A non-profit status could help keep costs down and attract foundation money. And with so few independent bookstores left in the city, I imagine a bookstore like this would attract visitors and shoppers near and far.<br /><br />It would be great if the place could be run as a co-op, giving the community a sense of ownership over its well-being. An elected board, I assume, would be charged with ordering books, planning events, and managing the day-to-day operations. It&#039;s something of a radical idea, but maybe that&#039;s what it would take to bring a bookstore to Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Of course I&#039;m just thinking out loud. What are your thoughts?

				On second thought, a bookstore which seeks out foundation money may not be a good thing. With foundation money often comes strings and a loss of autonomy. The financial burden of running a non-profit bookstore would probably be better served instead by offsetting money from sales with donations and voluntary sustainer dues.

				So there&#039;s a lack of bookstores as a whole in the borough of Queens.<br /><br />My thoughts on a couple of quotes from a NY Daily News article (below): &nbsp;I found the second paragraph in boldface below a bit surprising. &nbsp;Are rents set so high in local commercial districts that even national chain stores can&#039;t afford to pay rent? &nbsp;That doesn&#039;t bode well for the preferred independent bookseller. Hmmm... &nbsp;Now I&#039;m wondering how profitable that Barnes &amp; Noble in Forest Hills is. &nbsp;So, apart from the internet, the Forest Hills Barnes &amp; Noble seems to be the go-to store for people lacking books in their own neighborhoods. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyone know if Jackson Heights has ever had elected officials reach out to book sellers? &nbsp;According to the article linked below, Councilman Peter Vallone, Jr. seems to be putting forth a good effort for Astoria.<br /><br /><em><strong>&quot;I&#039;ve been trying to bring one here since I was elected,&quot; said Councilman Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Astoria). &quot;I reach out to different companies at least every month&quot;, but he has so far been unable to land a deal.</strong></em><br /><br />__________________________________________________<br /><br /><em><strong>But book lovers shouldn&#039;t expect a reading mecca anytime soon, according to one national book chain.<br /><br />&quot;Queens isn&#039;t the only place we have a limited presence,&quot; said David Deason, vice president of development for Barnes and Noble.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s throughout the boroughs,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s an affordability issue.&quot;<br /></strong></em><br /><br />From <strong>The New York Daily News:</strong><br /><br />Lack of local bookstore choices in Queens forces many to trek to Manhattan for a good read (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/04/06/2010-04-06_pining_for_a_novel_idea_dearth_of_local_bookstores_forces_many_to_trek_to_manhat.html)

				I&#039;m someone who believes in a physical, tangible book (probably to too great an extent, as my books have tended to overrun my various abodes, over the years). Even so, I am not really a fan of bookstores unless I need something and can&#039;t wait/do not want to pay extra money for it to be shipped to me. I buy most of my books online, and the rest of them I find in the trash or at swaps and yard sales and such. This being said, if a bookstore were to open up here, I would very much like it to be a locally owned and operated business, rather than a large corporation!

				I love the Strand too.&nbsp; I work right next to the huge annex they had (Financial District), which has since closed.&nbsp; I asked the mananger if they were planning to open up elsewhere and he said they were not.&nbsp; They would need a lot of space - I can&#039;t imagine how high the rent would be in JH for the square footage they would need, but I think the cost would be prohibitive.&nbsp; If the big chains can&#039;t justify the rent, I doubt the Strand could.&nbsp;

				Hello everyone, <br /><br />I&#039;m a reporter writing a story on the lack of a bookstore in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m trying to figure out when the last time there was a local bookstore. From what I&#039;ve pieced together, it was about 10 years ago and was called something like Discount Books and may have been located around 37th avenue and 77th street. <br /><br />Does anyone know of a more specific address for the store? I need to verify that this information is correct/incorrect. <br /><br />In addition, I would be interested in talking to you if you have thoughts/feelings on the lack of a bookstore in the area.

				book stores are increasingly hard to find all over the country. barnes and noble is on the verge of giving up&nbsp; brick-and-mortar altogether, borders is giving more and more space to non-readable items -- like build-a-bear workshops replacing children&#039;s books -- and independent stores (always my choice) are shuttering at an alarming rate. just google &#039;bookstores closing&#039; and you&#039;&#039;ll see story after story. <br /><br />sad to say, but most people don&#039;t read books. almost half of americans didn&#039;t crack even one last year, and the&nbsp; average person read three. that&#039;s not a lot of revenue -- and many people view the book like any other product, one where price matters most. meaning that amazon beats shakespeare and company nine times out of ten.<br /><br />sigh

				I hate to disagree with you, jadasie, but even in Manhattan you&#039;ll find that &quot;specialty&quot; bookstores are closing down everywhere you turn. While you might find a small selection of LGBT books in some smaller card shops, for the most part all the &quot;gay&quot; bookstores I remember are long gone. Likewise, there used to be a dozen stores that specialized in selling art books all around the Village-Flatiron-Chelsea area and most of them have vanished as well. I&#039;m not saying that I wouldn&#039;t <span class="bbc_u">love</span> to see a bookstore open in our neighborhood, only that it seems unlikely given the economy and trends towards e-readers and such.

				There&#039;s no doubt that for any bookstore to thrive in this neighborhood it must serve the neighborhood. As the previous poster suggested, stocking a solid range of classic and contemporary books in Spanish and South Asian languages would be necessary, along with a focused selection of English-language titles that run from romance and thrillers to literary fiction. <br /><br />But more than the actual books, I really believe that in Jackson Heights a bookstore would also have to involve the community with readings, workshops, story hours, whatever. I&#039;ve been to readings at Terraza where it is nothing but Argentine poets. Because Jackson Heights is such a diverse neighborhood, a bookstore could really focus on cultivating all sorts of internationally-minded literary events, which if done correctly could make the store a destination. <br /><br />I&#039;ve lurked here long enough to know some of you really dislike the idea of Jackson Heights &quot;becoming like Brooklyn,&quot; but if you look at the popular indie bookstores in Brooklyn today -- Word in Greenpoint; Book Court in Boerum Hill; Greenlight in Fort Greene -- they cater to their neighborhoods, and in doing so have facilitated book cultures that attract neighbors and folks from all over the city because of the programs they schedule. It doesn&#039;t matter what you think of these stores, these neighborhoods and their residents. What&#039;s important is the model of considering the community at large and involving it. <br /><br />If someone with the wherewithal and capital comes along thinking along these lines I believe a bookstore would thrive in Jackson Heights. &nbsp;

				zublop, the commercial rents in Brooklyn are much less than in JH.&nbsp; I love bookstores, but sadly, I just don&#039;t think one would get the foot traffic in JH that would be needed to make a profit.&nbsp; An independent store would never be able to afford the rent, and the big national chains won&#039;t come here - especially as one is already in Forest Hills.<br /><br />E-readers are another reason.

				I believe there was a small Spanish-language bookstore on 37th (around 81st) when I first moved to JH; it&#039;s probably been about 5 years since it closed.

				I remember that bookstore. I think it was where they sell CD&#039;s and spanish movies. If I remember correctly it was a mother and her son who worked/own it. They had lots of discount/ dollar books

				I see pop-up stands selling all sorts of books in Spanish (including love making!). Usually outside the Roosevelt Ave subway. I don&#039;t know if he does well.

				It won&#039;t happen, they never survive here. the huge Barnes and Noble on 6th and 23rd closed and is now Trader Joes. If they can&#039;t survive in Manhattan they are not going to make it here.

				Here&#039;s a Daily News article from earlier this year about the lack of bookstore in Queens:<br /><br />&quot;Queens may offer some of the best shopping in the city - and is home to the most profitable mall in the nation - but it could be the worst borough to find a good read.<br /><br />With only five chain bookstores boroughwide and one notable independent retailer, most residents must trek to Manhattan or Long Island to find the latest best-seller, or buy it online.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/04/06/2010-04-06_pining_for_a_novel_idea_dearth_of_local_bookstores_forces_many_to_trek_to_manhat.html (http://Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/04/06/2010-04-06_pining_for_a_novel_idea_dearth_of_local_bookstores_forces_many_to_trek_to_manhat.html)

				&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a good bookstore would do really well here. I don&#039;t think it needs to be all things to all people either. Owners<br />would pick books that they liked and wanted to introduce to this audience and see if it was a fit. Kind of like a smaller<br />boutique type store where you find the unexpected. My kid&#039;s school does a Book Fair each year here in JH and we do<br />well even in a few days. Friends have a book store a few hours away in the Catskills that is now open 5 years and<br />thriving in a smaller, mixed income neighborhood by doing lot&#039;s of readings and community outreach. Customers <br />make a point to support them buying all the books they need from this store even if they are delivered elsewhere.<br />Two studies came out this year to say if you could do one thing to help a student learn, it would be to buy children<br />a book they like. This one small thing has proven to have a significant impact in changing a child&#039;s experience in<br />education - one book - to have them reading. Think of the consultants we could do away with!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, please come to Jackson Heights anyone even remotely thinking of opening a book store. You would be <br />so welcome! We would be there with bells on..

				taggie,&nbsp; take a look at commercial rent prices for JH and then see if you still think a bookstore could make it here.&nbsp; It&#039;s just not a feasible business for this neighborhood, unfortunately.&nbsp; It&#039;s not an issue that people don&#039;t want to read - it&#039;s just that there&#039;s too much competition from online vendors and e-readers.&nbsp; There are too many people that are going to buy from Amazon instead of their neighborhood bookstore.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your school might do well at your book fair, but did you have to pay $10,000 to rent the space from which you sold books?&nbsp; No big chains are willing to come here because they have done their research and they know that JH is not a viable option for them. <br /><br />However, I have to wonder about a bookstore/coffee shop hybrid. Kind of like Espresso 77 with books. That might actually have a chance if it was done right.&nbsp; My dream store would sell books and good cheese!&nbsp; And would have some puppies running around...(hey, it&#039;s a dream store, I can have puppies!)

				I agree Lilybell. Rents are too damn high here in Jackson Heights! I have been over in Astoria alot lately and they still have many<br />small stores that cannot possibly be making huge amounts. But still they are in business and some of them employ a lot of people<br />and have really quality businesses. Maybe some real estate people are listening here or perhaps some owners who will lower<br />rents for certain businesses that would contribute so much to this community, like a fine bookstore/cafe/puppy hangout.

				I wonder if the rents in Astoria are comparable to JH.&nbsp; I have no clue, but I assume they are.&nbsp; Very different demographics though, so I guess it&#039;s a bit like comparing apples and oranges?&nbsp;

				You can&#039;t judge the demand for a bookstore by what people are reading on the subway. I read lots of books; it&#039;s just easier to carry magazines on the subway because I tend to buy hard-covers.

				I think people are right when they say that a bookstore would have to be a hybrid to succeed in the area. There&#039;s an interesting restaurant called Travel Books &amp; Food off the highway on the way to Boston. It&#039;s basically a diner-type restaurant but what makes it special is that with any food order, you&#039;re allowed to take 2 books home with you. The restaurant is just full of shelves of old books that they obtain from libraries, donations etc. I picked up a Carl Sagan book and a hard-to-find sequel to a children&#039;s series that I loved when I was younger.&nbsp; Could you imagine a place like that in the neighborhood? It would become a destination space if it made an effort to gather up all the random-language books in other bookstores/thrift stores that no one knew what to do with.

				I have to update my previous post on this topic as just last week my friends upstate with their bookstore <br />have decided to close it in a few months. Sad for the area. They said it was first the economy but a<br />surprise to me was that their really great customers who had kept them going through the downturn<br />had fairly quickly gone to e-books. So this was the last straw. Friggin e-books! But the hybrid idea <br />sounds really great. I notice now that a number of the stores like Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and<br />Yellow Rat Bastard all carry a selection of books. Maybe this is the answer? I want to say too that<br />the NY Art Book Fair two weeks ago here in Queens at PS1 was PACKED! It had a big selection of<br />homemade books, international titles, first editions and even art projects made for the Kindle. They<br />had big sponsorship too. What can that lead to? Something in Jackson Heights maybe?<br />

				Queens, unlike Manhattan and Brooklyn, doesn&#039;t seem to enjoy a recognizable literary community of writers, essayists, and general enthusiasts. I don&#039;t mean to suggest that intellectuals and literary types don&#039;t exist in Queens, only that they aren&#039;t pouring their creative energies into the sort of small magazines and writers&#039; workshops and reading groups that you&#039;ll find in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Before anybody might be willing to take a chance on a neighborhood bookstore, perhaps they&#039;d first like to find built-in community interest. To that end maybe we&#039;re in need of a <em>Queens Bookforum</em> or <em>Jackson Heights Review</em>, or some other online cultural and literary initiative (hopefully with a more original name). This might be a worthwhile project in and of itself.

				I remember a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode where Peggy buys a bookstore only to find out there&#039;s no money in it. I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s usually people with old money who open them up as a hobby and not a source of income. It&#039;s gotta be a real high-risk venture this day in age. Like our local shoemaker.
