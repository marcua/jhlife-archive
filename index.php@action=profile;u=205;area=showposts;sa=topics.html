					Residents beware, attempted carjacking early this morning around 12:05am on 37th Avenue (between 87th and 86th streets) south side of the street. A late model white sedan aggressively pulled up to our car and a man jumped out and started to pull on the door handles demanding to let him in multiple times and started to bang on the car window, while the white sedan sped off towards 88th street. The 115th precinct won’t do anything since the car was not stolen and no one was hurt (thankfully). This happened next to an NYPD camera.

					For the past two weeks an ad truck for Major World has been parking on 37th Avenue from 82nd - 85th Street throughout the night.<br /><br />The problem with this truck is the massive and intrusive size of the video screens that are displaying these ad’s. The truck is clad with giant screens on each of it’s “white box” sides while playing music.<br /><br />Other than being “visual pollution” to our community, this truck also poses a safety risk for our pedestrians and drivers. The light and glow emanating from these screens are blinding when driving past them and have the same effect when crossing the street as a pedestrian.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this illegal for Major World to do?<br />&nbsp;

					Hello All, <br />Over the past couple of months there has been a huge surge in graffiti right of 37th avenue from 87th Street to 81st Street. Every time I walk past those streets I seems to spot a new tag. I know the the beautification group does graffiti cleaning and you could report it to 311. But, what can we do for an immediate fix. I would be more than willing to volunteer to clean it my self of I had the supply&#039;s to do so. I think now more than ever our nabe should be spotless. <br />- A concerned lifelong Jackson Heighter.

					There is an older man who sits under the scaffold at the construction site every weekday morning. The problem with this is that not only is panhandling, but he always is drinking beer and leaves the area he lounges in a filthy mess. Not only do I dislike the mess and having a man drunk by 9am on our streets, but I fear what type of danger he might pose to our community.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" />

					Living in New York City gives us an amazing array of dining and snacking choices and there is always a hidden gem somewhere.<br />Put down your favorites ........... :smitten:<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Forty Carrots </span><br />Bloomingdale&#039;s<br />1000 3rd Ave, 7th Fl<br />New York, NY 10022<br /><br />Located on the 7th Floor of Bloomingdaleâ€™s, Forty Carrots is known for there Frozen Yogurt which is amazing&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" />. They have two separate parts a dine- in section and a take- out section. I strongly recommend to dine in , they have an amazing brunch and lunch . It is also very inexpensive and has a vast amount of healthy choices, even the frozen yogurt is low fat. But, beware the large frozen yogurt is enough to feed 3&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" /> Flavors are Red Raspberry, Original, Mango, and Chocolate, they are known to switch around flavors, and therefore it&#039;s always a surprise what the selection is. Amazing place, salads, sandwiches, and frozen yogurt.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Grand Lux Cafe </span><br />Roosevelt Field<br />Garden City, NY 11530<br />516-741-0096<br /><br />Located next to the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, Long Island&nbsp; (Only 20 - 25 minutes away by car). Grand Lux Cafe is a venture between the owners of The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and The Cheesecake Factory and has around 11 locations nationwide. The place is amazing over 20 foot ceilings and very upscale in decor. The menu ranges from all American, to Asian and European favorites with reasonable pricing and top notch quality and amazing serving sizes. Personal favorites are the Max Burger, Salmon Three Ways, and Sheilaâ€™s Dream Salad. They also have a very good kids menu. Prices range from $14 - $32&nbsp; &nbsp;, the kids menu is $5.50 - $7.00. They have outdoor seating!!!! :rockon: and avoid it during dinner time on the weekends it is packed&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Cafe Riviera</span><br />830 Manhattan Avenue<br />Brooklyn, NY 11222<br />(718) 383-8450<br /><br />Located in the heart of Greenpoint , this bakery is my favorite , sorry Lety&#039;s and Canelle&nbsp; :embarassed:. It is a mostly Polish speaking bakery but they are very friendly and helpful . There quality is heavenly, best croissants I&#039;ve had, they have raspberry, chocolate, ham and cheese and turkey and cream cheese filled croissants. My favorites are the large cheesecake slices with strawberry&#039;s and almonds on top, the amazing Tiramisu like no other filled with Gran Marnier, and Passion Fruit and Mango Mousse. This is only part of there selection, they have $1 espressos, windowed doors that open to the street, the prices are great, and there quality is top notch :smitten: . The space is small and only has 5 tables, which means it gets crowded often. I love this place, only 15 minutes away by car. The croissants range from $2.00 - $2.50 and the pastries are all $3.00.&nbsp; :rockon:<br />

					There is a new place going up on 82nd and Roosevelt, I really couldn&#039;t tell the name i know it&#039;s not Pinkberry but some other rather obscure brand . But, hey it&#039;s an improvement from the cellphone shop it replaced it is also a corner property so I think it might spruce up that corner a little&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Recently I have seen an increase in the amount of graffiti in the neighboorhood . I was surprised when i saw it on a building on 35th and 79th a believe in the side of the building in purple . Also on the side walls from 87th to 84th facing 37th ave the graffiti just keeps mounting on . All by the same two or three vandals, they have also &quot;tagged&quot; the &quot;Feel Beauty&quot; supply store on 37th and 84th on the tiling under the windows . This has been there for weeks and they have not cleaned it. The times i wait for the bus I always see the &quot;easel&quot; as i like to call it on 37th and 82nd constantly be &quot;tagged&quot; on time after time the JHBG cleans it along, with the massive graffiti on the roof and side walls of the beautiful buildings on 82nd . For the &quot;easel&quot; my solution would be to install tasteful but, bright lights on the wall and it would be my dream that a picture such as the one they have in the two Commerce Banks to go there . This being an aheisive one such as the ones that wraps some buses , cars , and windows .&nbsp; The same with the lights on the roofs on 82nd st . Is there some possible way of making this happen I know that the JHBG does a lot of cleaning up and that there is The 82nd Street Business Improvement District . As for The 82nd Street Business Improvement District the only work i see done is the Christmas lighting and such which is very nice , but for the improvement of 82nd st very little . Is there anyway to get any of these plans into a realty ?&nbsp; I would be glad to help in anyway to make this happen .&nbsp; Thank You <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
