				&nbsp;This has to be the time in this term for JH electeds to give us what most other Queens communities have- a real Community Center. It has to happen now. What does it look like? What do people want? All ages and abilities, babes and seniors, tweens, teens. Young athletes<br />and new athletes of any age. Computer centers and dancing, a senior center, after school programming. Programs for fathers. And for mothers. Town halls. Voting. All kinds of post school classes. And could we dream about a pool??? We need and deserve this for our community which wants a 365day a year place to exercise and much, much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;Which candidate is going to bring it??? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				What about simply, to begin with, pop up centers in the various empty storefronts (some have been vacant for years) that abound in the neighborhood?<br /><br />ex-Famous Famiglia Pizza in the Roosevelt Ave Subway Station stop...springs to mind. <br /><br />Perhaps, with the focus of press attention, the MTA could be made amenable (or even forced) to support such a community-minded project. <br /><br />That large MTA owned space has been sitting empty and sad and unused for a long time now.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				A community center would be amazing. Everything you listed below, including classes, exercise space, a lecture hall/events space, community events for a wide range of ages and interests, after-school programming, etc. I share your pool dream too! That would be just amazing. <br /><br />Shekar Krishnan has made this one of his priorities. It&#039;s something I&#039;d definitely support enthusiastically!

				&nbsp;Love, love, love Make the Road and their ideas for a community center are great! A big difference is that they are not tending towards physical activity, senior activities, dance classes or many other activities that the NYC centers do in other neighborhoods. Check out some of those listed by me previously. Make the Road as a group are excellent fundraisers though, and that is another thing to praise them for as they bring in the $$$. Their work with immigration is stellar. Look at the recent ads on NY1 for Sunnyside Community Services and see how welcoming and diverse in range of activities they are for a typical NYC center and their facility is not fancy in the least!

				If you guys can find an adequate space and a landlord that will provide a very affordable rent, let me know. I would be happy to get see how we can get Sunnyside Community Services involved in setting up and running the location.

				&nbsp;Thanks for the offer about Sunnyside. I personally think they run a terrific organization. They do it with lots of support from various electeds and the Dept of Aging, DOE for PreK and the meals groups, etc. Any kind of center needs to be started by political sources to get all of the funds for services if it is to be open to the general public. The community would be very supportive, I believe, once things started happening. This weekend AGAIN - third in a row- had sub-par weather making physical activities outdoors less attractive. A Community Center is the golden ticket that we need here in Jackson Heights. OS somewhere maybe later, maybe smaller like the rest of NYC?

				&nbsp; Would love BOTH!!! But the Community Center is the highest need first. Then a full impact study<br />done on the whole neighborhood impact of 34th Ave Open Streets post pandemic and tailored for<br />a new reality. The Community Center need is what we know most about now though. All in plain<br />view here.

The community can absolutely help start a center. The biggest obstacle is finding affordable space. If the community can help in finding very affordable space, Sunnyside already has the know how and expertise in securing funding and grants. It would need to be around $20/psf with some credits toward the build out of the space. <br />Electeds usually aren&#039;t going to be the ones to find this.

				&nbsp;Intriguing! Can you give any examples of communities locally where they&#039;ve done this recently? I only know of ones affiliated with groups, like Hanac with the Greek community in Astoria or a senior center in Cambria Heights operating with funds from Alpha Phi Alpha, the Black mens fraternity, and these were started awhile ago. I am not as familiar with Elmcor but imagine they got started when real estate was much more affordable and they have built out their program for 50yrs in a beautiful way.<br />&nbsp;Who would secure the lease, for example, if a building was found to be available? Even Sunnyside, I know, has had lease and money issues and they are seriously supported by city agencies. There was a time a few years ago they seemed very worried about having to relocate and I believe it was the electeds that stepped in. Obviously, they survived but it seems daunting without backing and an organizational framework from the onset.

				&nbsp;<strong>$5 Million to Astoria for Boys and Girls Club from Donovan Richards! </strong>Let&#039;s get in line Jackson Heights. We need a year round facility for physical and social community engagement. Our local weather gives us many days that are not appealing for outdoor events- more than half of the days in the year! We need something for the neighborhood that is indoors, and with a roof for that part of outdoors, so we can count on a place to go for these needs.

There is a kitchen so it could be a Senior Center for lunches and activities, a teen center after 3:00pm which we desperately need, Mommy/Daddy and me in earlier morning hours and who knows what else? We really, really need this and there could be a build out on the top for more stories of athletic use and other community related activities.

I want to stress though that my belief is that we need a non-partisan group to lead this and think it&#039;s best if it comes through electeds. We have a lovely patchwork here in JH, and Queens in general, of various activities and specific groups. BUT what I have seen work best in other neighborhoods is where there is a more centralized clearing house type of community center that works as a stand alone place plus a referral service to many smaller operations. I wouldn&#039;t want it to be personality driven in any way. Apparently, some people already think we have enough to do here and this isn&#039;t needed. Or that it was tried before unsuccessfully with the Christian Scientist property. One current conversation is about a high school being built on Northern and 55th. This discussion could happen at a community center in addition to online and there would be wider reach. Plans could be viewed physically and overall, more engagement from the community. Just what we need.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a unique opportunity if in fact there is a way to make it happen and the further up the food chain (government) the better as far as I&#039;m concerned. This is spoken by someone who has experience with non profits and has been in the room when the questions come about how to pay the bills, keep the lights on, doors open, etc. if grant monies and other sources dry up.FYI- anyone reading here who wants to ask also, should do so and ask the politicians - all of them! Staying hopeful here.
