				Sooooo.... we kind of have a brewery. Mikeller is opening up IN Citifield<br />https://ny.eater.com/2018/3/22/17151912/mikkeller-brewery-open-photos-menu-nyc (https://ny.eater.com/2018/3/22/17151912/mikkeller-brewery-open-photos-menu-nyc)<br /><br /><br />Open to the public Wed-Sunday, not just during games. I have no idea who will go there on non-game days (other than me). This brewer is regarded as one of the top brewers in the country.

				Visited the brewery this weekend. So many taps! When we were there most were Mikeller beers but as things kicked they sometimes replaced with other guest breweries like Other Half, Hill and Bissell! Check out what&#039;s on here: https://www.mikkellernyc.com/menus/#on-draft<br /><br />Pint pours tend to range between $6 and $7.50. They also offer a 4oz taster size and some higher ABV beers have an 11oz pour option. They are also selling to-go pint cans of their flagship beers which are to be made on site like Say Hey Sally (pilsner) and Henry Hops (IPA). Really great (I think adorable) NYC/baseball themed merchandise is also for sale.<br /><br />It sounds like the food menu is a still being firmed up. We really enjoyed the cheese steak sandwich done by the Whitman&#039;s restaurant folks in the East Village. The space is very large and welcoming. I for one will be back there soon. If you like beer this is worth the trip!<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little backstory about this brewer, his estranged brother and their respective new Queens breweries coming online: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/nyregion/evil-twin-mikeller-breweries.html

				Thanks BEB! Excited to try this. How does it work, and where is it located in the stadium? Do they just keep one of the Citi field gates open?<br /><br />Glad to hear they aren&#039;t charging baseball prices for pints, but I wonder if they will during games!

				Hey NYC Peromyscus,<br /><br />I exited the 7 train on the Citifield side and yes a gate was open. It is located on the outer perimeter of the stadium. Exiting to the right after leaving the 7 station and heading around to the back should get you there quicker. (We took the long way around by heading left.) <br /><br />Those prices I referenced were printed on a formal menu. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d change pricing for game day since their system is all computerized. It is likely they could charge more for some of these special &quot;guest&quot; brews however.&nbsp; BTW they mentioned they&#039;d now be selling a few Mikkeller can types inside the stadium on game days...so I&#039;d guess those would get the premium pricing. ;)<br /><br />PS They are open today and tomorrow too to get their operations running smoothly before Mets opening day. They said that won&#039;t be a common occurrence once the season gets underway. I hope you enjoy it!<br />

				Follow them on facebook. They mentioned getting rid of the 4 oz, because it&#039;s too much pouring.... and it gets busy there. Folks were against that move...

				Stopped by Mikkeller tonight. What an amazing place. https://www.mikkellernyc.com/about/<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know, it&#039;s a huge spot built into Citi Field Right Field, just at Willets Point, which is all torn down now. <br /><br />They have over 60 beers on tap, all their own. Yes, they do. <br />The whole place is sleek and spartan and very Copenhagen&#039;y. <br />There are finely shined long tables in the wide open area, a small bar area, a private room and the stainless steel vats of the semi-open brewery. <br /><br />They also have a small menu, but we didn&#039;t eat. I had a sour raspberry oak aged beer at about 9%, but there were other fruit beers at other alcohol levels, besides the incredible beer menu. <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that on game nights, its incredibly crowded and chaotic. The bartender was describing this elaborate and very organized system they have for addressing the ordering process and I&#039;m convinced its&#039; as efficient as it can be. However, I really loved having that big space to just a dozen people. It&#039;s clean, crisp and like nothing we have in the area. Plus, it&#039;s a skip away. I can&#039;t wait to bike there. The brewery is trying to get a permit for outdoor service, and there is tons of room and even a patio area (when games aren&#039;t on) It was lovely to leave and see the full 10 cars of the 7 train glide past and see the skyline of Flushing in the distance. It&#039;s a wonderful wide open sky, which we don&#039;t get often enough. <br />Parking is available when there are no Met&#039;s games. <br />I highly recommend it. Due to the crunch on game days, they stopped serving 4 oz flights. I hope they bring them back as I really wanted to try a bunch of beer. They have 6 oz and up. Follow them on facebook for updates and if you can, push for the 4oz. <br />Great place!!

				Just to add to that... <br /><br /><br />The prices are totally up and down the spectrum. I think they bottom out at 6 and go up to the teens for a pint or so. Mikkeller has about 30 breweries around the world actually, and they have beers on the menu that say if they are from Europe, San Diego, or NYC (I think that&#039;s the extent of that). Pretty cool. Would be great to go on an off-day too. They also have beers from other GREAT breweries from NYC and elsewhere https://www.mikkellernyc.com/menus/<br /><br /><br />I went about 2 hours before a game recently and it didn&#039;t get crowded til around 45 minutes before 1st pitch. I am getting comfortable with spending a lot of time at the stadium recently... like, enter at least an hour before first pitch and just walk around and do some raffles and games and whatever. It&#039;s too expensive to drink at the game anyways. <br /><br /><br />Also, I haven&#039;t implemented it yet but there is a deli in willets point just 2 blocks away which could be a great place to hang out, drink, and eat tacos called Master Express. I think the beers are $3 and they have a good jukebox.

				I haven&#039;t been there yet, but this is what Google maps shows for location. The train is on the far bottom left of the image (blue square icon) and the brewery is on the right (orange map locator icon). Depending on your screen size, you might have to scroll to the right to see it.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/Ebxl1pt.jpg)

				Sadly, they closed last month. It was an interesting idea but ultimately inconvenient in its location. Mikkeller International is notoriously guarded about their management decisions and has yet to put out a statement about whether the company will maintain presence in NY. The space will be replaced by EBBS, a new brewery venture backed by the family who owns the Mets. At least the gear will not go to waste.
