					So this is what the NYC DOT has come up with for 34th Avenue as presented to Community Board 3 last Thursday evening. While I don&#039;t love it, I can live with it, which probably means all the car-haters will thoroughly reject this plan.<br /><br />You can read the details and see some diagrams here:<br /><a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/dot-unveils-plan-for-34th-avenue-in-jackson-heights-includes-pedestrian-plazas-and-car-access" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/dot-unveils-plan-for-34th-avenue-in-jackson-heights-includes-pedestrian-plazas-and-car-access</a>

Obviously they did not come to Jackson Heights or Woodside where there are encampments underneath virtually every LIRR or BQE overpass.<br /><br />Given that we are electing both a new mayor and city council members this year, how the candidates are going to address the issue of homelessness in our streets is one of my major concerns.

					Everyone please examine your receipts carefully from Foodtown. On each of my last three shopping trips there, I did not get the card member advertised sales price on items that I had purchased. I carefully checked my receipts and it does indicate my member card was successfully scanned, yet I was charged full price for the items, which included yogurt, shredded cheese, frozen foods, and canned soup.<br /><br />On my next trip, I will avoid the self-checkout and go to the cashier and raise hell if I don&#039;t receive the advertised sales price.

					Has everyone seen these pop up all over the neighborhood? DOT has taken it upon themselves to place &quot;loading zones&quot; on many of our residential side streets, essentially removing two parking spaces on each side of a block between the hours of 7AM and 7PM weekdays. While there&#039;s been plenty of talk about the 34th Avenue &quot;Open Street,&quot; there was no consultation with the community or local residents about this to my knowledge. <br /><br />There is absolutely NO need for loading zones on a residential block where the fire hydrants essential serve that purpose. Where loading zones ARE needed is along commercial avenues where delivery trucks often create obstruction hazards, but my guess is that DOT doesn&#039;t want to lose the metered parking revenue along 37th Avenue or Northern Blvd.

					I am passing along this information on behalf of some of my neighbors in the Greystones. We realize that many are going through great financial difficulties themselves at this time, but are appreciative of any support that can be given. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>April 27, 2020<br /><br />Dear Neighbors and Friends,<br /><br />We are saddened to report that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit home, like it has for so many others across our beloved neighborhood, city and country. Our neighbor, Luis Barroso, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital via ambulance three weeks ago. Since that time, his wife and young daughter were unable to visit. And tragically, they were unable to say goodbye. Luis passed away last week, after weeks on life support.<br /><br />The family he leaves behind have been under strict quarantine since he was taken to the hospital. They were only able to get news of his passing through a nephew who worked with the Elmhurst doctors trying so hard to keep Luis alive.<br /><br />Luis’s wife lost her job at the start of the pandemic, after the city shut down non-essential businesses. They have not been able to see family, friends, or celebrate his life with their community. Our hearts break for them, and like many of you, we feel helpless.<br /><br />We recognize that these are uncertain financial times for all, but if you are able, please consider donating to the GoFundMe page <a href="https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">here</span></a>. The funds we raise together will help pay for Luis’s cremation and the return of his remains to his birthplace in Ecuador. Even more urgently, your donation will help his wife and daughter navigate these unimaginable times.<br /><br />No donation is too small. Please be as generous as you can. If you are unable to support financially, do not underestimate the power of unexpected kindness—condolences in the form of cards can be sent to: <br /><br />The Barroso Family<br />35-21 80th Street, Apt. 21<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br /><br />Thank you for your kind thoughts, prayers, and contributions. Please don&#039;t hesitate to share this note and the GoFundMe page (<a href="https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><span class="bbc_u">https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund</span></a>) with your networks.<br /><br />With our deepest gratitude.</strong><br /><br /><hr /><br />Steven Tomkiewicz <br />on behalf of James Minor

					Can anyone help me with this... especially any of the realtors who frequent this message board: I&#039;d like to know how common flip taxes are in the Jackson Heights Historic District? Does anyone know which properties have a flip tax (also known as a transfer fee) imposed on unit sales? <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard 2-3% of the total sales price is a typical formula for Manhattan coops. Is it less in Queens?

					A number of newer street trees on 80th Street in front of the Greystones were vandalized on Sunday evening. One tree was completely severed and two others have deep cuts in their trunks. It looks as if some of the lower branches were hacked off as well. I don&#039;t know what motivated someone to damage these trees that were only planted last year, but I thought everyone in the neighborhood should be alerted to the vandalism.

					I must say I was very impressed by the reopened produce market on 78th St. and 37th Av. as I walked past on my way to the subway this morning. Beautiful displays outside and at the front of the store, and I loved all the woven baskets hanging from the ceiling. From what I saw, their prices on fruit and vegetables seemed very good... I can&#039;t wait to stop and shop on my way home tonight! Looks like a great new addition to the neighborhood.

					I&#039;m VP of our coop board at the Greystones and we&#039;ve started experiencing trouble with one of our circa-1917 dumbwaiters. The gentleman who has serviced our building for many, many years is getting too old for this type of work anymore and I was hoping that perhaps someone from one of the other landmark buildings in the area might know of a contractor/handyman familiar with this sort of project. I&#039;ve looked online and can only find companies that service modern dumbwaiters (which are essentially small, electrically-powered commercial elevators and not the old-fashioned rope-and-pulley systems we still have).<br /><br />Any leads would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

					I was just wondering if anyone heard any details about the house fire on 85th Street between Northern Blvd. and 34th Avenue that happened yesterday afternoon? I was snarled in traffic on Northern Blvd. by all the emergency vehicles that had blocked off the street, so i wasn&#039;t able to see the extent of the fire. I haven&#039;t seen anything about it online in the news today. Was it confined to a single home and was anybody hurt or injured?

					I just want to alert local residents that I am aware of three attempted break-ins at the Greystones in the past few weeks. In one case, the culprit (or culprits) was unsuccessful in getting past the security gate on the window, but in the latter two cases they did manage to get into the apartments. As I understand it, all three occurred during the daytime while the residents were at work, all were top-floor apartments, and it is presumed the burglar(s) came down from the roof via the fire escape. Reports were filed with our local precinct and in the hope of preventing future burglaries in the neighborhood I thought I would post this warning. <br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><em><strong>Keep an eye out for suspicious activity, remember to lock any windows facing the fire escape before you leave your apartment, and if you have security gates on those windows, use them.</strong></em></span>
