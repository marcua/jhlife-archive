			Breaking news on Jackson Heights Life! <br /><br />We&#039;re getting a new eatery on Roosevelt Avenue, called Green Plantains.&nbsp; According to their website, Green Plantains is &quot;a Nuevo Chino Latino Dining Experience. Our menu features the finest in creative Latin and Caribbean-style cuisine with a touch of Asian influence. Our hearts and souls go into every dish we prepare, and the food we serve reflects the passion and heritage of our Dominican roots.&quot;&nbsp; Sounds very promising.<br /><br />I noticed a new sign for the restaurant today at 79-09 Roosevelt Avenue... it&#039;s not open yet, and there was no indication of when it would open for business.&nbsp; This is the second location for this restaurant... the first location is in Gainesville, Florida.&nbsp; Interesting that they decided to break into the NY market in Jackson Heights... perhaps this is the best way to get noticed among the foodie community.<br />

			There are some reviews on yelp of the original location in Gainesville here http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-plantains-restaurant-gainesville.<br /><br />Four yelp members reviewed it and gave it an average of 4 of 5 stars.&nbsp;

			<br />
			From reading through the menu, I&#039;m thinking that this may be a chain restaurant similar to the likes of Pollo Tropical?&nbsp; Pollo Tropical, a popular chain also in Florida, has seen additions in Jersey and Brooklyn.&nbsp;

			The Green Plantains space looks finished.&nbsp; They have a menu posted on the window, and a help wanted sign on the door.&nbsp; It seemed there was some sort of new employee traning class going on when I passed by today.
