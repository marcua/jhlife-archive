				I got a Zillow alert that a 2BR/1BA near us just sold for $570,000. <br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/8412-35th-Ave-APT-5N-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/79509931_zpid/<br /><br />I&#039;d been following it and a few others that are similar to ours. Like this one that closed for $568,500 in March:<br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/8310-35th-Ave-APT-2R-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/79509916_zpid/<br /><br />And this one for $550,000 in January:<br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/8310-35th-Ave-APT-6U-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/72649176_zpid/<br /><br />At first I did a double-take, thinking maybe I&#039;d saved one with two bathrooms or a terrace or something, but no, they are 2BR/1BAs. What they do all have in common are renovated baths and kitchens with pro stainless steel appliances and stone countertops. Nicely staged and photographed. <br /><br />When we bought 3 years ago, I expected the homes in the area to increase, and of course I&#039;m happy to see them increasing in value. But is anyone surprised at how fast it&#039;s moving?<br /><br />When we bought, most 2BR/1BAs were about $320-$350k.<br /><br />It took about 10 years in Carroll Gardens before we saw the same increase that it&#039;s taken 3 years to see here.<br /><br />Are we in another bubble?

				I know from my own experience looking at JH listings that prices have gone up pretty steeply over the past two-three years. I saw something on the NYT listings yesterday that I thought confirmed it for me. A graphic on the listing showed that prices for one-bedrooms in Jackson Heights had gone up 43.5% in the past five years, and when I looked at an Astoria listing, it showed that prices for one-bedrooms had gone up just 4.4% during the same time. I thought, WHOA!<br /><br />But I just did some more poking around. For <strong>two</strong>-bedrooms, prices in JH went up 26.2%, and in Astoria they went up 55.7%!<br /><br />I also checked Carroll Gardens: 39.4% for one-bedrooms, and 96.6% (!!!!) for two-bedrooms.<br /><br />Since this is a formula the NYT devised, the figures may not necessarily jibe with other sites&#039; stats. But also, I think various factors could skew the results.

				So if 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartments in these buildings are going for $570,000 and $580,000, then what would a 2 bedroom, 2 bath go for in the same buildings?&nbsp; Usually a second bathroom commands a high premium.

The Colonial Court location is a little more comparable to WP than the Monroe; it&#039;s just outside the historic district, and it&#039;s closer to the 73rd-74th Street noise and bustle. But its maintenance is significantly lower than a similarly sized/priced apartment at WP.

				It certainly seems as if we could be in a bubble. We bought in 2011, paying what was then a high price for a 2bed/2bath in our complex. We were dismayed to see that in the year or two after that, the average sales price in our complex was a good chunk lower than what we paid. Timing is everything. But now the average sales price has zoomed way higher. It&#039;s almost tempting to put the place on the market now, mid-bubble, take the money and run...but where to?

				If all of NYC is in a bubble...then yes we are in a bubble.<br /><br />I am guessing we have simply caught up with the rest of NYC...<br /><br />I am not certain why folks look at Jackson Heights as existing in a vacuum.&nbsp; <br />We are just part of NYC, that&#039;s all.&nbsp; <br />15 minutes from Midtown by subway.&nbsp; Midtown, where prices are up to double what&#039;s here. <br /><br />Looking at it that way, it makes sense that prices are what they are here. <br /><br />What happened is that Queens had a &quot;forgotten borough&quot; element for decades.&nbsp; <br />And now it doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />So magically, folks recently began discovering that &quot;Hey there&#039;s this giant borough next to Manhattan and Brooklyn we forgot about.&nbsp; And it&#039;s not so expensive&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hence the rise in prices and Queens becoming expensive.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				As A2K noted, we are moored to the city as a whole and if its in a bubble, so are we.&nbsp; That being said, neighborhoods perform differently from one another and asking if a particular area is in a bubble is not an indication of an island mentality.&nbsp; Tenable arguments for bubbles in Brooklyn could certainly be cast. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see JH in a bubble at all.&nbsp; Its my opinion, and that is the reason we bought here, that the recent surges is the market correcting undervalued real estate more than anything else.&nbsp; Its proximity to the city, along with its beautiful housing stock makes it an attractive place to live and its largely landmark status limits supply and the possibility of an UGM (ugly glass monster) being plopped next door.&nbsp; Prices may plateau of course, but I wouldn&#039;t hover my finger near the trigger for fear of being mid bubble.&nbsp;

				I think what the comment about JH being in a vacuum refers to is the sense that Queens in general has always been perceived as far removed from Manhattan (and now Brooklyn) in those boroughs&#039; more upscale nature vs blue collar/middle class Queens, that Queens is like the store brand versus the high-priced brand and thus prices here should always remain lower, or just plain low. People don&#039;t perceive prices as being relative instead of fixed and they are shocked to see the current numbers, which are so much higher than only a few years ago. But when you see what is happening with prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn (something people probably are not so aware of unless they actively follow real estate trends) with studio apartments going for half a million or more, then the prices here do seem reasonable by comparison. But what goes up also comes down and it does seem kind of alarming that the ramp up in prices happened so fast.

				I agree about the inherent value here of the beautiful, historic architecture and gardens that are landmarked and thus protected. I also love the small town, neighborhood-y atmosphere along 37th Avenue, the low profile buildings, etc. The two things that really concern me, that sort of &quot;harsh my mellow&quot; about the neighborhood, though, are gang violence as seen in the recent stabbings and the crazy, reckless drivers that seem to be prevalent around here, with so many incidents of cars coming up on the sidewalk or smashing into parked cars, pedestrians being hit, etc.

				I like the metaphors of bubbles and vacuums, but I think we should keep them separate. :)&nbsp; (Google &quot;vacuum bubble&quot; to see what I mean.)<br /><br />Jackson Heights seems to me a bit of a market inefficiency -- For whatever reason, the properties here are undervalued as compared to similar (prewar, spacious, etc) ones in other neighborhoods with similar commuting times to Manhattan. So, I think of people purchasing coops in JH as a little bit like Billy Beane selecting players with high on-base percentage for the Oakland A&#039;s when these players could be had more cheaply because other teams did not (yet) recognize their value. <br /><br /><br />

I haven&#039;t noticed any particular evidence of younger people <em>preferring</em> Queens to Brooklyn. (I&#039;m leaving Manhattan out because I believe Brooklyn is a much bigger draw.) With the ones I know or have encountered, it&#039;s more about being unwilling or unable to pay the rising prices in Brooklyn, and/or the overdevelopment and the influx of &quot;outsiders&quot; ruining their neighborhoods. I think most of them want someplace less expensive that&#039;s still easily accessible to Manhattan and Brooklyn.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You also have to compare apples to apples.

The housing stock there is so different from in Jackson Heights. It&#039;s funny how neighborhoods will develop in different ways. For instance, though Astoria is filled with small buildings (two to six families), there are still a number of larger prewar buildings. But hardly any of them are coops. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a reason, but I don&#039;t know what it is. Established coops in Astoria are rare compared to Jackson Heights; if you want to buy an apartment there, most of the listings are for newer condos.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done much comparing of coop prices between Astoria and JH, but I wonder if the prices you&#039;re comparing are for apartments that are the same square footage, or just the same number of bedrooms. Astoria&#039;s prewar apartment buildings tend to be older than Jackson Heights&#039;, with smaller apartments with smaller, boxier rooms. When I was looking to rent a few years ago, what I could afford would have gotten me a small one-bedroom in Astoria, vs. a large one-bedroom or small two-bedroom in JH. (I used to live in Astoria, back in the &#039;80s, but I got priced out because Astoria was being promoted as the next cool place to live in NYC.)

				Prices keep getting higher and higher in JH.&nbsp; I just found out that Washington Plaza is raising prices for their new listings (it looks like the ones that are already listed for sale are not increasing but I&#039;m not positive).&nbsp; <br /><br />Example: There are three apartments with the same floor plan with an asking price of about $415K. They just listed a new one yesterday with the same exact floor plan and the asking price is 455K. <br /><br />

				Hi all! Happy to contribute to this discussion.<br /><br />Historically coops have held their value well, even during the downturn in the market, since <span class="bbc_u">most coop units are owner occupied and owners are 20 % or more (not to mention emotionally) invested in the properties</span>. Though coop buyers are still susceptible to market markers such as interest rates, unemployment and inflation rates, rising demand for personal residences which require a complete board screening can hardly be classified as a “bubble” in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you Shelby for posting the recent resale information from our recent email blast:<br />35-36 76th Street, #326, 2 Bed 1 Bath - Asked $578,500 - IN CONTRACT ABOVE ASK<br />35-21 79th Street, #6N, 2 Bed 1 Bath - Asked $598,500 - IN CONTRACT ABOVE ASK<br />76-10 34th Avenue, #1T, 1 Bed 1 Bath - $337,000 - IN CONTRACT ABOVE ORIGINAL ASK<br /><br />I can assure you that final recorded prices won’t disappoint. We will release them as soon as they close.<br /><br />Sectors of the marketplace that are being flooded with investor funds, foreign or domestic, some even institutional funds, can easily be called a bubble. Over the past few years we’ve seen a race to build properties into NYC airspace priced north of 10 million at an average price of $8,500 per square foot. This is a micro sector, which by all accounts is highly speculative. <br /><br />I had written a recent article which brushes against this topic. http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/hows-the-market/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/hows-the-market/)<br />It talks about the micro-markets of NYC. Jackson Heights Coops are a single sector of what I would classify as a micro-market, which by all indicators is a very healthy one&nbsp; :) <br /><br />To add : we will be launching a 2 bed 2 bath soon which will ask just under 800k. You can check http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com) for details in a few days.<br />

				Don&#039;t underestimate the effect of sustained historically low interest rates.&nbsp; Granted, there are a lot of all cash buyers in this market but if interest were a healthier 5-6% there wouldn&#039;t be such a rush to higher numbers.&nbsp;

				If anything it seems to me JH is in less of a bubble than much of Brooklyn and Manhattan.&nbsp; I bought here 2 years ago because it just seemed ridiculous how much real estate you could get here given almost all factors I could compare to places I saw in brooklyn, manhattan and LIC/astoria.&nbsp; If anything it seems to me this may only be the beginning for real estate in JH, since rising prices will also lead to even more desirable businesses and stores locating here.&nbsp; Really the main thing we don&#039;t have here compared to places in Brooklyn that are still twice the price and the same distance from Manhattan is certain types of businesses, but those may come as the residents who seek them out arrive, only further improving value here.

				A 1-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, bathroom, and electrical just went for 316k, which is definitely not a lot of money, but in April and March, apartments with the same layout (at least one of them in significantly better condition) sold for 302k and 302.5k. Granted, they were probably on the market in the winter, but that seems like a significant price increase.

				I think it&#039;s that there&#039;s a certain price that two earner families (with high income) can afford. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s $850k at current lender rates, just for sake of argument.

				As more and more younger couples are being out priced from Manhattan and Brooklyn, I think that families will turn to Queens. Jackson Heights has a great transit hub and spacious homes and apartments so I think we will continue to see an upward trend. The Griswold has spacious apartments but a tiny garden space and is further from the subway I happen to like the Belvedere. Nice lay outs and larger garden.

Any projections can only state opinion, nothing more. That said, the increase in Jackson Heights prices dates back farther thatn three years. The price climb started as far back as 2011, when I think Jackson Heights prices bottomed out after the 2008 market crash. Since then prices have seen a steady 7-10% annual increase which in a way had a compounding effect. In simple dollars and cents 1 bedrooms increased 15-20k annually where 2 bedrooms as much as 20-30k annually, ultimately reaching today’s pricing levels. In day to day experience we see this is as a steady climb, not an immediate massive trajectory. With this knowledge in hand, it stands to reason that in the event of a market shift, any price declines will be just as slow, rather than a massive drop. <br /><br />Now, would anyone be advised to wait until prices begin to drop to make a purchase… It would NOT be simply advisable to buy into a market that you believe is dropping. No-one wants to be catching a falling knife. But think about this - when evaluating any investment you evaluate your long term risks and tax implications. When buying company stock for instance, you often go in with the understanding that the value of your portfolio may drop over time, but you believe in its long term growth. Real estate is no exception. You buy it long term for value, tax benefits and hold it as a long term investment. <br /><br />I hope this helps in your planning. I’d recommend that you speak with your accountant to establish what your tax benefits of ownership may be, it may help with your decision to purchase and manage your long term risk. <br />

				I assume since you&#039;re closing next week that the offer was made and accepted 4-5 months ago. Seems like even that recently prices were pretty different?

				the last couple of sales in that coop last year were 2 bedroom units that sold for 375k.<br /><br />if it hasnt sold for a while you may be able to come in below asking. Also the maintenance on that unit is very low which will add up to savings in the long run.<br /><br />Is 425k expensive for a 1 bedroom in JH? Yes i think it is... it&#039;s amazing how much prices have gone up in the past year or so. but that&#039;s the going rate now and SOMEONE is paying those prices, so unless you want to wait it out and see if prices go down.<br /><br />

				Thank you Shelby2! Yes, unit 429 at Colonial Court is in congract over the original asking price and is scheduled to close this month already. Subsequently we put unit 629, two floor up, in contract off-market as well. Both sales prices will be revealed upon closing.<br /><br />We do have one unit available at Colonial Court presently, which is also a relatively new listing, #122<br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-36-76th-street-122/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-36-76th-street-122/)<br /><br />There is a clear correlation on pricing across the board, which in what is a rising market, does create a comparative harmony. <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think it normally takes 4-5 months to go from offer to closing, does it? I bought my apartment from an estate and it took a little longer than usual - but not 4-5 months - since we had to work around the schedule of the executor, who wouldn&#039;t have had the same kind of urgency that someone trying to sell to move elsewhere would have.

				Washington Plaza is going up in price AGAIN! We got another amendment saying they&#039;re going up by another 15% (changes not reflected on the RE websites yet). Wowza.

Most of the delay was due to the appraiser, who sat on the appraisal for four weeks without doing anything. We got a low appraisal back, and (unsuccessfully) challenged it, which took another two weeks or so.

				^we recently refinanced, and had to get an appraisal done. If we were selling, we would have challenged the appraisal. One of the comparables was a unit in our building that had been put on StreetEasy.com and the asking was below the minimum we know the board was accepting. The day after we received the appraisal we noticed the listing price popped up to the board minimum, so we assumed someone had finally talked our management office. I now know that barring more proactive communication from the board to shareholders, when I sell my apartment I&#039;m going to have to check all the listings to see if someone threw up their apartment to sell without checking to see what the requirements are to get a sale approved.

				When I sold my Carroll Gardens place I knew it was going to under-appraise, so I put together a comps package and handed it to the appraiser in person. It&#039;s really hard to get them to change after the fact - it can seem like they didn&#039;t do their homework. But if you make their research easy, you make their jobs easy and you ensure they get best info. No one knows the neighborhood as well as we do.
