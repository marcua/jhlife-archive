				Friday at 2:30 in the afternoon I saw a man assaulting a woman on 37th road across from the train station and the former Eagle Theater.&nbsp; The man was trying to grab her cane, and she was holding on while he whipped it left and right, dragging her body in one direction and then the other.&nbsp; She screamed for him to let go.&nbsp; He screamed obscenities that the filter on this forum would not allow.&nbsp; Both the assailant and the victim appeared homeless.&nbsp; Pedestrians walked by without raising their eyes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another woman, perhaps homeless as well, but much less destitute in appearance, shouted for the man to leave the woman alone.&nbsp; The man then lurched towards her, flailing his arms.&nbsp; She threatened to call the police, and then took out a cell phone and dialed 911, and described the incident.&nbsp; She assured the woman and her female companion that the police were on the way.&nbsp; The man walked away, but came back a few minutes later.&nbsp; He pushed the woman with the cane again, knocking her to her side.&nbsp; The woman with the phone screamed at him, and he lurched at her, arms flailing, pulling down his pants, and screaming that he was going to blow her brains out.&nbsp; She called the police again, and this time so did I.&nbsp; I approached the women at this point, and told them that I had called the police too, and that I would provide a report to the police of what had happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over the next half hour, nearly a dozen calls were put into 911.&nbsp; The operators often insisted that the police were â€œalready thereâ€ although they were not.&nbsp; And during that half hour, the man, who was either mentally ill, severely intoxicated, or both, went back and forth&nbsp; between terrorizing these women, pulling his pants down, pushing them, screaming threats and obscenities, and wandering off down the street, only to come back and start again.<br /><br />When the police finally arrived, I was already late for my 3 PM meeting in midtown.&nbsp; The woman with the phone and I waved at them, but by this point she was screaming hysterically, insisting that he had assaulted her too.&nbsp; The police asked her what she had done to cause the attack.&nbsp; I was stunned.&nbsp; The original victim sat quietly clutching her cane, smiling in a way that was inconsistent with the events going on around her.&nbsp; I tried to talk to the police, but the male office yelled at me, and told me to â€œstand over there!â€&nbsp; I tried to speak again, and he yelled â€œI said OVER THERE.â€<br /><br />I stood for a few minutes.&nbsp; Finally, I wrote my cell phone number on the back of a business card, gave it to the officer, and said I would be available to file a report after 5 PM when my meeting was over, but that I was very late.&nbsp; I stated again that the man had assaulted the women, and that he clearly needed mental health services, and I got ready to get on the train for my meeting.&nbsp; A man who works in my building had witnessed the end off the incident, and asked me what happened.&nbsp; I gave him a short summary, and he said â€œWell, you did your civic duty.â€&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I didnâ€™t feel as if I had done my â€œcivic duty.â€&nbsp; But I donâ€™t know what I could have done differently.&nbsp; Other than walking with my eyes averted, like most of the people on the street.&nbsp; <br />

				honestly, unless you carry mace -- illegal, but a very good addition to any purse, as i have found -- there&#039;s not much you could&#039;ve done. the police are only interested in protecting some of the people some of the time, so i generally find them to be part of the problem, not part of the solution. and yes, i know they have their apologists....if they&#039;ve done specific good for you, swell. not for me.

				I have a thought about this incident and it can&#039;t be validated in any way not being present for all of this but is it<br />possible that this is a cycle with these few players at this location that plays on a loop? I only say this because<br />of many years walking a dog in Travers Park with local homeless and the dramas that were played out by the <br />same cast over and over. It was frightening at first because of the violence and language but it quickly became<br />familiar as there were fights of many sorts with the same cast of characters.<br />This is not to offer any excuses for anyone&#039;s behavior but it may be a commonplace event in this location and<br />therefore, tiresome for all onlookers. You did the right thing regardless of the outcome. Sorry you were late.

				Taggie, I suspect that you are right, and that the police had been to that corner before, and that is probably why they were in no hurry to respond to the numerous 911 calls.&nbsp; Clearly, the victim, her friend, the woman with the phone, and the abusive man knew each other.&nbsp; I was seeing it for the first time, and it was shocking.&nbsp; <br /><br />This man should not be on the street.&nbsp; Certainly not in that condition.&nbsp; As I said in my original post, I don&#039;t know if he was mentally ill, drugged out or both.&nbsp; If he is mentally ill, the police should have brought him to emergency psychiatric care at Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; And if this happens on a regular basis, he needs serious long-term help.&nbsp; The woman with the cane does not deserve to be beaten and abused, even if she is homeless, and even if the abuser is someone she knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot get these events out of my mind.&nbsp;

				It does sound cyclic, like it&#039;s happened before.<br /><br />I was actually more amazed that the less destitute woman had a cell phone to begin with.&nbsp; Maybe they aren&#039;t homeless, but Elmhurst outpatients from the psych day treatment.&nbsp; Years ago there was an annex by the train, no?&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s in the complex now ...

				I see what I believe to be these folks alot. they usually sleep across from the train station with a huge shopping cart. I also know they frequent the liquor stores nearby. People often wonder why others don&#039;t get involved. Now you know why. This person called the police, waited and tried to help for what? This is why people have become cold and do not want to get involved. I am not police bashing because they do risk their lives however I feel alot of the officers at our precint are extremely rude and quite cocky. The ones that i&#039;ve encountered seem to enjoy having some semblence of authority. I&#039;ve witnessed numerous things over the yrs and have found that like the OP the police/operators seem unintersted in assisting in a timely matter or at all.

				<strong>The New York Times</strong> article linked to below tells of how a homeless Guatemalan immigrant was recently stabbed and died, reportedly while trying to assist a woman that was being angrily confronted by someone else.&nbsp; According to the article, the deceased, Alfredo Tale-Yax, lay in a pool of blood for over an hour before police being called.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found the following excerpt interesting, and makes me wonder if the same can hold true to situations like the one described by KC, above:<br /><br /><strong><em>But to the question of obligation â€” whether those who encountered the body should have stopped and helped the man â€” the answers came quickly.<br /><br />Perhaps the passers-by thought he was just drunk. Perhaps they were illegal immigrants themselves, too nervous to contact the authorities. Or perhaps they had just learned a lesson that Mr. Tale-Yax so clearly had not: better to keep to oneself than to risk the trouble that comes from extending a helping hand.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s bad,â€ said Alexis Perez, 29, the superintendent of two buildings on the block where the stabbing occurred. â€œBut I live here, so I know what itâ€™s like. There are a lot of alcoholics who drink and then they fall down and theyâ€™re laying on the ground. People say to themselves, â€˜I donâ€™t know them so I wonâ€™t get involved.â€™ â€ </em></strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Questions Surround a Delay in Help for a Dying Man (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/nyregion/26homeless.html)

				yes, it&#039;s a difficult situation. I usually see the same set of characters on bway and 74th st. they are always horsing around and cursing at people. this one woman always calls me an a-hole when I walk by. then one day I come by with my tricycle and all of the sudden, she&#039;s my best friend... a fair weather one, I guess. <br /><br />my personal situation aside... <br />I&#039;m not even sure what to do. the man was probably not a person of reason, so it&#039;s no use talking to him. I wouldn&#039;t want to touch him, so would it be proper to get a long stick to fend off his assaults? what then if he spits on me? I think I&#039;d throw up. Mace is probably a great option, but any substance sprayed would do... hair spray, lotion, even water might get him to stop. <br /><br />as for the guy who was dying... I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all seen drunk, homeless people lying on the street, many times bleeding. If it was creating a puddle on the street, I would hope I&#039;d call the police. I don&#039;t think they mention when a call was made to 9-11 in the article though. Are we just supposed to wait for 9-11 to come? is that absolving us of responsibility of a person in need?

				I wouldn&#039;t lose any sleep over this incident. Most likely she wasn&#039;t going to press charges against<br />the guy anyway so you were just wasting your time. I think I know who you are talking about. This woman was really skinny right? I see her sit on the handlebars of a bike with a tall scruffy old guy who<br />wears a yankees cap.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why this bothered you so much,I can see it if it was a law abiding<br />productive member of society who was being assaulted but this wasn&#039;t one of those people.

I couldn&#039;t believe that you were actually saying what I thought you had said. But yeah, you are saying just that. <br /><br />I learn the lesson over and over again that there some people out there who are cold and uncaring, completely devoid of empathy or respect for their fellow humans. I see evidence of this every day, to a varying extent, in this city. I struggle to believe that we, as a species, are collectively working toward and moving toward a better way of Being, that we are slowly evolving to be more considerate and more understanding of one another, that we will ultimately reach some kind of as-yet-undetermined enlightenment which will enable us to coexist and to help one another. Perhaps this is naive, but it is my secret and necessary hope. This being said, I confess: it only takes something like this, some utterly ignorant and hateful comment (anonymously made on an internet forum, no less) to make me doubt that fragile belief. As long as there are people out there with a dark and vast abyss within them, people who are intrinsically selfish and full of hate and fear, people who keep themselves closed off from the world, clinging desperately to their failed and feeble ideologies, we will be stuck exactly where we are, only slightly better off than our monkey counterparts, flinging feces at each other and killing one another with little or no provocation. I&#039;ll chalk you up to a failed attempt at humanity. You&#039;re holding us back, dude.
