					<br />Hello all!<br /><br />My name is Michelle Williams and I am a health coach specializing in women&#039;s health. I was born and raised in Jackson Heights living here for 26 years! I love my neighborhood and I want to help my neighbors live a healthy and active life. So I&#039;ve decided to start a walking club. My mother and I exercise together and our favorite activity to do is walking! We walk all over Jackson heights and we even have walked to Manhattan! <br /><br />Every Saturday Morning at 9am we will meet in front of PS 149 93-11 34th avenue. This club is for women of all ages. Women who want to band together and empower one another to take control of their health. Bring your good walking shoes and a bottle of water! <br /><br />Any questions or comments feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mwellnesscoach@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">mwellnesscoach@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Hope to see you there!

					still missing as of July 2018 from JACKSON HEIGHTS, QUEENS -- It took one visit to a Queens rescue shelter for the Kotsaftis family to fall in love with Tiger, and one freak accident for them to lose him just a week later.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights family has spent months combing the streets of Queens for their beloved pooch, a 30-pound brindle Jindo who they adopted from Korean K9 Rescue in Long Island City. His tan fur and dark brown stripes practically picked the dog&#039;s name out for him.<br /><br />Ted Kotsaftis told Patch his wife was taking Tiger on his nightly walk when his leash broke and startled him. When she and other bystanders tried to approach and catch the pooch, he got frightened and took off.<br /><br />&quot;We have not seen him since,&quot; Kotsaftis said. &quot;I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve trespassed in everyone&#039;s backyard and alleyway trying to find him.&quot;<br /><br />The days since then have been tough on the family, who just days before Tiger&#039;s escape talked in disbelief about how strongly they&#039;d come to love the dog after just a week together.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;ve never been so proud to walk a dog,&quot; Kotsaftis said.<br /><br />Tiger was the last pooch the family expected to take home when they walked into an adoption event at Korean K9 Rescue. Kotsaftis and his wife wanted a small dog that wouldn&#039;t shed, but their 8-year-old son, William, saw Tiger and had other ideas.<br /><br />&quot;We were hesitant at first but my son was relentless, so we took him for a walk and just fell in love,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#039;s goofy and playful and he sheds all over the house. He&#039;s the best.&quot;<br /><br />They were exactly the type of family Gina Boehler, Korean K9&#039;s founder and director, hoped to find for Tiger, who had a rough life before he came to the shelter from Korea three months ago.<br /><br />The pooch, like so many others at Korean K9, was rescued from a dog meat farm and brought to the Queens shelter for adoption.<br /><br />&quot;We had him for two and a half months before he was adopted,&quot; Boehler told Patch. &quot;He was fearful at first, but we rehabilitated him and by the time we finished he absolutely loved people. That&#039;s why we gave him to a family.&quot;<br /><br />Boehler said it&#039;s still not uncommon for such rescue dogs to get easily frightened and bolt while adjusting to the city. She and her team have worked tirelessly with the Kotsaftis to locate Tiger since he disappeared, covering the neighborhood with lost dogs flyers, working with a trained dog tracker and recruiting volunteers to keep their eyes peeled.<br /><br />Kotsaftis said the community support has helped make an awful week bearable.<br /><br />&quot;There have been so many nice people willing t0 help and donate their time,&quot; he said. &quot;It reminds you that there are still good people in this world.&quot;<br /><br />Tiger was last seen in the family&#039;s neighborhood near 34th Avenue and 72nd Street the night he bolted, Boehler said. There have been no more spottings since then, but she and the family remain confident the pooch is still alive and has found a hideout spot.<br /><br />&quot;Given his background, I&#039;m very confident that he can sustain himself,&quot; she said. &quot;These dogs survive months with little to no food or water. These dogs are really, really tough.&quot;<br /><br />If you think you&#039;ve spotted Tiger in your neighborhood, Boehler warned not to approach or chase him and to call her at 347-466-0333.<br /><br />&quot;If you chase him he can run into traffic,&quot; she said. &quot;It has to be done by one of us - somebody that knows him and that can lure him.&quot;<br /><br />The family is offering a $1,000 reward for the dog, and asks the public to call them at 917-518-3232 with any tips or information.<br /><br />&quot;We think he&#039;s out there somewhere surviving and we&#039;re trying hard to keep our hope alive,&quot; Kotsaftis said. &quot;We&#039;d love to have a happy ending to this story.&quot;

					Sunday Nov 12, 9:50am i saw a large breed tan and black dog running down from Roosevelt Ave to 37th Ave, cross the street, thank goodness no cars and made a left on 79th. There was no stopping hiim, he was running so fast. He looked well taken care of and young. <br />I hope that he stops to rest and someone can call him over and not get hit by a car. <br />If you find him, contact QUEENS LOST AND FOUND PETS ON FACEBOOK. <br /><br />I think it is Tyson who is posted on there but not sure, he ran so fast but had same coloring.

					I was walking my dog across the street from the park when suddenly about 10 undercover cop cars came SPEEDING DOWN the block - two were going soooooooooooooo fast maybe 120mph down the block. Me and another lady were shaking watching this with kids and cars stopped at the light on that block. The cars went so fast THEY JUMPED in the air because there is a speed bump, both cars went so high, that is how fast they were going and there were other cars waiting for the light to change, they almost hit those cars that and the cars that were pulled over and there are kids and people playing and walking around there. <br /><br />they were going down 77th and turned onto 76th street between 34th Ave and Northern Blvd. <br /><br />The cops and undercover cops BETTER SLOW THE HELL DOWN!!!, I don&#039;t care what is happening, they need to be reported!!!!, I wish I had taped them but I was in shock and shaking. <br />I don&#039;t know what was going on I looked in the news but didn&#039;t see anything, this happened around 5:45pm yesterday.

					My friend told me that about 5 weeks ago she heard a dog crying on her block. She lives on 73rd street and 30th Avenue (its the avenue that the Lexington School for the Deaf is on) ..she went out to investigate and the neighbors said that a man got out of his car&nbsp; and tied his dog to a pole and beat him with a hammer, left him bleeding and got back in the car and left. <br /><br />The neighbors were feeding the dog and trying to help him, he was a friendly dog.. they called the cops and the dog was taken away..I fear he was taken to the ACC which is a kill shelter and who knows if he is alive any longer. The bring all the dogs and cats there..its very sad. <br /><br />Does anyone know about this?

I am unable to keep him because my landlord does not allow dogs. He has all his shots and paperwork, he is fixed, he is a great dog. I need to find him a home before 3 pm TODAY 2/13... If you are interested, please call me at (646) 260-4904 <br /><br />here is the link with a photo<br /><br /><a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/pet/1599115732.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/pet/1599115732.html</a><br /><br />
