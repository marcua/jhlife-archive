			Can anyone recommend an art/sculpture restoration studio in Queens or Manhattan?&nbsp; I have several projects in need of loving care -- not looking for &quot;museum&quot; quality, just family &quot;heirloom&quot; quality.&nbsp; The projects include restoration of an 8x8 stone sculpture (pieces broken off during a move) and an organic material piece of art which fell and broke into several pieces. Any leads are much appreciated!

			Try my friend Darius Shemaria. He typically restores fine and ancient art but he will also do family pieces. <br /><br />https://www.dariusshemaria.com/
