					BTW it&#039;s great to see everyone who&#039;s able to reach out to businesses they love and appreciate, to see if they&#039;d like to rent storefront property at the Bruson Bldg when it opens…I myself reached out to a few gyms with classes as well as entrepreneurial friends (no one is committing to anything so far), and also talked with a rep from borough president Melinda Katz&#039;s office to see what kinds of community spaces the city would be willing provide to our area.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s also been a lot of talk about how the commercial realtor can be more proactive in reaching out to potential businesses, like all of the ones residents were suggesting at the meeting last Thursday… There was an interesting feature on Marketplace radio a couple of months ago about how the process of inviting certain establishments to a neighborhood works… If you have the time to listen to their findings (it&#039;s about 8 mins long) it&#039;s sort of fascinating, but also disillusioning.&nbsp; At the end they talk about what to do to &quot;make it feel equitable&quot;…&nbsp; <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/changing-neighborhoods-york-fig" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/changing-neighborhoods-york-fig</a>

					As to the Y, Senator Peralta approached the YMCA** and they responded that they need 30,000 square feet, and Bruson is only 20,000 square feet. However he said the School Construction Authority only needs 20,000... <br />**He added that he&#039;s approaching the YWHA as well.

					The responses to this opportunity to invite exciting, unique storefronts to 37th Ave &amp; 75th St are really inspiring (I also shared thoughts at <a href="index.php@topic=11816.120.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=11816.120</a>) <br />There are so many ideas being posted, and I suppose the next question becomes how to implement these establishments, or whether the realtor that Craig Bruno and the other landlords are working with has a similar vision to the community&#039;s. I assume our local representatives can school us on how it works with influencing commercial realtors to bring the businesses that we feel the area needs...but in the end, who really takes the reigns?

					Thanks all for coming together to influence what the Bruson Building owners (in this case Mr. Craig Bruno) will do with the renovated spaces on 37th Ave off 75th St.&nbsp; There are various opportunities here and I&#039;m glad we&#039;re exploring all avenues possible.&nbsp; We definitely don&#039;t need another McDonald&#039;s or Burger King in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I wish it could be as it was, with La Portena restaurant and Armando&#039;s Italian (I know they&#039;re moving to Northern Blvd) and Frank&#039;s (I know they&#039;re on 77th now)&nbsp; but I suppose they had to move on with their businesses after the fire.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll all agree, we need healthy food options, and spaces for families with children.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think opening a &quot;fast food&quot; franchise enhances our community. Some might say, well these are affordable restaurants, but so is say -- Pollos a la Brasa, or Tomo Japanese, or Arunee -- and at least these are far more unique, and offer an arguably friendlier atmosphere.&nbsp; <br /><br />There has been talk of possibly luring a franchise like Panera, and also backlash against that idea, and I&#039;d chime in that the one thing that is wonderful about Panera is they encourage community groups to come together in their coffee shops.&nbsp; They welcome clubs, support groups, even knitting circles (and aren&#039;t going to throw you to the curb as some places tend to do if you don&#039;t &quot;buy&quot; enough).&nbsp; <br /><br />Another franchise that is growing, that offers eco-conscious organic food options is Bareburger.&nbsp; (Any entrepreneurs on this forum who want to look into opening one up?)<br /><br />And just to chime in on Trader Joe&#039;s, I agree with many that it could be a delightful addition, since they offer creative &quot;no-frills&quot; items (&amp; really I know of no shop really like it around here)...I would just share that a couple of years ago I got a bunch of my neighborhood friends to write to TJ&#039;s to ask them to look into the empty Mandee&#039;s shop by Blockbuster (now thankfully occupied by Garden School UPK) TJs sent automatic responses that they&#039;d look into it -- and there would have been parking &quot;built in&quot; at that spot -- but they did not end up coming through obviously.&nbsp; At the time I also called the owners of that block of stores, and he let me know the exorbitant amount he was asking for per month...I said it&#039;d be great to have a studio there for kids&#039; workshops, or perhaps to bring in a Trader Joe&#039;s to compliment the greenmarket, and he just said he &quot;didn&#039;t think we needed another supermarket&quot;.&nbsp; As if we needed another car parts store!!]&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve also seen Whole Foods talked about on the local forums, and yes they offer a plethora of earth-friendly and unique options, but I believe they look for very affluent areas to settle in, so they may not look here... Luckily, we have the mom &amp; pop shop &quot;Downtown Market&quot; on 84th St that offers a lot of the same items. <br /><br />A couple of people along the way have mentioned book stores, which in essence are fantastic, though I know it can be hard to make a profit because of internet competition... I would be thrilled if the city would support the opening of a new Queens Library branch.&nbsp; I know that libraries are non-profit, so perhaps that also wouldn&#039;t bring in the kind of $$ the building owners are looking for... (But if it is funded by the city, doesn&#039;t that mean it is steady revenue?)&nbsp; I like to imagine a space to compliment the one on 81st, with space for interesting workshops, and all the learning opportunities a library offers for everyone.&nbsp; (Again I look at the library expansion happening right now in Long Island City with the branch in the Citibank building.&nbsp; It started out small, but they want to accommodate the need in the area, which is a need we also have)<br /><br />Several folks have also declared that we could use a bigger gym in our area...I completely agree, because it would be great to finally have a gym again that offered CLASSES!&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that our residents like to come together to do group aerobic exercise (as seen by posts on various forums) and basically we are currently using borrowed spaces at neighborhood schools (or going outdoors - which is fine - but during WARM weather)&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as could also be considered recently purchased White Castle corporate space on 69th St, we need more child-friendly spaces.&nbsp; NY Kids Club in LIC for example is a nice open room where kids can safely climb and move indoors, and there are ramps for strollers, which is really lacking right now our area.&nbsp; We have such great classes for young kids in Jackson Heights, but again right now they are generally held in spaces with no elevators, which make it extremely difficult for caretakers to safely bring their babies upstairs.&nbsp; <br /><br />It sounds like the &quot;new&quot; storefronts and offices at Bruson would be spacious, and could accommodate options like these, if the owner would open his mind to the possibilities.<br />

And it&#039;s super Irish.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Ready Penny&#039;s a fun down-to-earth spot! I love the Irish bartenders, and there&#039;s a pool table and darts and Guiness. What more do you need really? And so close to the subway if friends from other parts want to come visit.&nbsp; There&#039;s also Legends on 35th Ave, with a nice bar menu, and seasonal Sam Adams (somehow I associate Boston with Ireland) Many of the patrons are Irish-American (and some of the bartenders have lived in JH for decades)<br />

					I was at &quot;61 Local&quot; in Carroll Gardens the other night and thought...I would just love it if there were a place like this in JH...craft beers on tap (the hefeweizen was heavenly) and a nice open space that was just hopping on a weeknight...Earlier in the summer I&#039;d also gone to Strand Smokehouse in Queens and that was super fun because of the great food, the rockabilly band playing, and the kid-friendly atmosphere.<br /><br />Anyway I AM SO EXCITED about The Queensboro!&nbsp; Best of luck Dudley!&nbsp; (I just signed your mailing list)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

					That&#039;s a bummer about Brother Bubble! It was fun to go there after trips to the library.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also agree that Ten Ren in Elmhurst was awesome - their orders were made in front of you with fresh ingredients. I was heartbroken when their shop closed.&nbsp; At least there is still one on Mott St in Manhattan.

					That reminds me that there is a small black cat that&#039;s been roaming the yard on 84th St off 37th Ave. He/she has white paws and is very nice.&nbsp; I saw it last winter a few times, then it disappeared for a few months, and now this October it&#039;s back.&nbsp; Perhaps someone had taken it in and then released it again; he/she does not have a collar.&nbsp; It would be great to see this little guy go to a good home. <br />&nbsp;<br />Also, I have friends in the neighborhood whose 4 adult cats are up for adoption (they are about to have twins in addition to their toddler and can&#039;t take care of everyone).&nbsp; Feel free to message me and I&#039;ll send info.
