				Hey,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m on the 6th floor in an apartment that&#039;s the nearest one to the elevator. There is a strange smell that permeates the immediate entrance/alcove area of the apartment at least once a day (maybe fewer). I can&#039;t say what it is exactly. It&#039;s not a bad smell, but there is nothing pleasant about it either. It sometimes smells like food when it&#039;s being cooked, but not exactly. The wierdest thing is that i can&#039;t locate the source. I&#039;ve gotten on my hands and knees and sniffed around the floor molding, the walls, the entrance closet, and the smell always seems strongest in free standing spot of the entrance/alcove area. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one thing that does stick out is that i was told that behind the semi-circular alcove and behind the elevator there is a chimney where steam comes out. That seems like the obvious answer, but again the smell isn&#039;t any stronger by the wall that is closest to this chimney. And this has been an issue during both winter and summer. Any suggestions? Any recommendations for scenting the air with something that is not heavily perfumed?<br /><br />thanks.<br />&nbsp;
