				it would be great if that were the case. the location was a restaurant at one point -- a Bangladeshi place called Grameen that served some terrific fish dishes, so i&#039;d imagine having a full service restaurant wouldn&#039;t be an issue. fingers crossed!

				Agree that would have been great--that space is close by and Addictive is a far walk away for m, or I would go much more often as I really like it. They do an excellent job.
