				I noticed on the Citizen App that there have been multiple fires in JH in the past couple of days, even one this morning on 94th St. <br />The postings on the app are full of comments saying it&#039;s very strange/suspect. I know that sounds a little bit like conspiracy/paranoia, but I&#039;m curious if anyone else has noticed this/has any ideas as to why? Do you think it is purely coincidence and not all that abnormal? I noticed that there doesn&#039;t seem to be a source of the fires released as of yet.

At this moment, they are only accepting money donations to the Gofundme. There may be other ways to donate that I don&#039;t know of, but as of what I saw last night (Wed. 4/7), that&#039;s the status. That could change at some point if the organizers are able to get indoor storage, or if the families start to move into new apartments.<br /><br />Gofundme https://www.gofundme.com/f/89staid

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Can anyone point to a comprehensive story about this fire? What are the plausible outcomes for the tenants? How can our elected participate in helping here or if they already are, can we know what the details are? Long term, what can be done as a community to insure this doesn&#039;t happen again to others. It is impressive that the NY Fire Dept was there in three minutes but how did it spread to two buildings so suddenly? These and many other questions are in my mind and think others might be interested as well. Would also like to know about non-monetary needs that neighbors might help with as have heard that random donations aren&#039;t always the best. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Does anyone have a fuller story so we can understand the scope of this tragedy?
