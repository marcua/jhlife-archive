				The wonderfully diverse food carts of Jackson Heights have a growing following city-wide.&nbsp; They get a significant amount of media coverage in both blogs and traditional news outlets, so there&#039;s a lot of information to be found on the web about what you can nosh, where, and when.<br /><br />Our most well known vendor is of course the beloved &quot;Arepa Lady,&quot; featured (http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/dining/22VEND.html) in the <em>New York Times</em> and famously canonized (http://www.thesquaretable.com/fall02/arepalady.htm) by Jackson Heights&#039; own Jim Leff, co-founder of Chowhound (http://www.chowhound.com).&nbsp; Jim has been working to raise awareness of other vendors as well: here is his Map of Obscure Street Food in Jackson Heights (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/388653).<br /><br />Another famous JH food carts is Sammy&#039;s Halal, which won the Vendy Award (http://gothamist.com/2006/10/23/halal_cart_take.php) in 2006.<br /><br />So, which are your favorite carts?&nbsp; Any ordering tips?

				Today, Gothamist has an article on what is believed to be NYC&#039;s first Tibetan Food Cart, Shangrila Express (http://gothamist.com/2007/11/13/shangrila.php), at 73rd &amp; Broadway. <br /><br />UPDATE: Via JacksonHeightsNYC (http://jacksonheightsnyc.blogspot.com/2007/10/chowhound-reports-shangri-la-has.html), I see that Chowhound (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/454976#3074880) was on this story before Gothamist.

				I am partial to the tacos at the cart on the corner of 84th and Roosevelt outside the Sovereign Bank unofficially (or officially -I&#039;m not sure) called Two Ladies Taco Cart.&nbsp; However, Jim Leff of Chowhound says don&#039;t order the tacos from there- order the sopes or gorditas instead!!

				I&#039;m a big fan of Shangrila Express.&nbsp; The guys running the place are SUPER, super sweet people, and their food is simple but always good in a pinch.<br /><br />Plus their hot sauce for the momo&#039;s and shabala (sp?) is just phenomenal.<br /><br />I also dig the sammy&#039;s guys a bunch too.<br /><br />Anyone know what happened to the Halal vendor that was right outside of Duane Reade on 37th Avenue?&nbsp; He disappeared all of a sudden.

				If you haven&#039;t already, you MUST go to the Shangri-La food cart on Broadway between Roosevelt and 37th Rd, right off of the Roosevelt-74th Street subway stop.&nbsp; It&#039;s awesome!<br /><br />They have been touted on Gothamist and i think Chowhound, as well as featured in other publications (maybe NY Post or Time Out?).&nbsp; <br /><br />They serve traditional Tibetan food - only about 8 choices.&nbsp; The MoMos and Shambalay&#039;s are to DIE for.&nbsp; Plus they are the nicest people and will engage you in conversation - ask you how you heard of them, etc.<br /><br />Be sure to read the articles they have posted on the cart with their reviews and mentions...and be sure to check out their picture of the Dali Lama..<br /><br />Definitely a GREAT addition and a nice change from all the halal carts.&nbsp; Give it a try...you won&#039;t be disappointed (plus I want them to stick around...)

				I am huge fan of the two dollar tacos on Roosevelt between 74 and 75th Street.&nbsp; I belive the sign above the cart says &quot;Mexican Food&quot; and there are usually two guys or a guy and girl working the cart - only open after seven pm.

				So I ate at one of the Halal carts today.&nbsp; It was spontaneous or I would have looked up the location and went to Sammy&#039;s.&nbsp; But I was walking along 37th Ave. and saw two carts on 74th Street.&nbsp; One of them said HALAL so I thought &quot;uh huh, this must be Sammy&quot;. <br /><br />So I went over and ordered chicken and rice.&nbsp; And I asked the young guy: &quot;are you Sammy?&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp; I asked, &quot;is this Sammy&#039;s cart?&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp; I asked, &quot;how does the chicken and rice come?&quot;&nbsp; He said &quot;okay&quot;.&nbsp; I asked, &quot;does it come in bread or on a plate?&quot;&nbsp; He said, &quot;okay&quot;.&nbsp; I asked &quot;do you know much English?&quot;&nbsp; He just smiled.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now it was my turn:&nbsp; &nbsp;He held up two tiny green peppers that I knew were HOT and I said &quot;okay&quot;.&nbsp; He chopped them up and added them to the chicken.&nbsp; He held up a plastic bottle of something white and I said &quot;okay&quot;.&nbsp; He squirted it on my food.&nbsp; He held up a bottle of something red and I said &quot;okay&quot;.&nbsp; He squirted that on my food. <br /><br />So I went home and opened the carton and saw a mountain of rice, chicken, etc. and ate it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it was as good as Sammy&#039;s.&nbsp; I have to say I think the white sauce was mayonnaise.&nbsp; Whatever it was, I didn&#039;t love it.&nbsp; The chicken was a little grizzly.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t love that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will look for Sammy&#039;s cart next time and pass on the white sauce and give it another shot.&nbsp; All this for science.

				Buddy, thank you for your investigations in the name of science!<br /><br />Personally, I haven&#039;t been able to figure out the Sammy&#039;s cult.&nbsp; I have had some tasty food there, but it&#039;s not appreciably different from that of other carts nearby or in Manhattan.&nbsp; This (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sammys-halal-jackson-heights) seems a bit much to me.&nbsp; Besides, they appear to be franchising (http://www.chowhound.com/topics/337507).&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve ever actually had something prepared by Sammy (http://gothamist.com/attachments/food_laren/2006_10_food_sammy.jpg) himself.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never had an opportunity for a side-by-side taste test... perhaps that will reveal Sammy&#039;s food in all its sublime glory.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s hard work, Buddy... I appreciate your contributions to human understanding of these critical mysteries!<br /><br />In the meantime, don&#039;t miss the momos &amp; Shangrila Chicken at Shangrila Express, or my current favorite, pollo or cecina tortas at the Gallo Giro taco cart.

				Hey buddy,<br /><br />Sorry to hear your halal experience wasn&#039;t so great.&nbsp; Todd&#039;s pretty much right that there&#039;s not a great difference in taste or quality amongst all the halal carts in the neighborhood, but the sammy&#039;s cult exists, because he was the winner of the first Vendy awards (http://streetvendor.org/vendies/last_year.html) in 2006, and he also makes his own red and green hot sauces.<br /><br />He&#039;s on the corner of 74th and broadway on the broadway facing side of the street in front of Astoria bank.&nbsp; He is there some nights too - I&#039;ve had the man serve me himself.

				Could someone give me the approximate hours for Shangrila Express?&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried to find them twice, once on a weekend and once after work and was out of luck both times.&nbsp; Maybe I was looking in the wrong place?&nbsp; What storefront are they in front of on 74th St?&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I gave Sammy my business instead, even though I was really hankering for the much revered momo&#039;s.&nbsp; (Are they similar to Chinese fried dumplings?).&nbsp; Also, IMO, Sammy&#039;s gyro platter is much tastier than his chicken.&nbsp; I have a cart guy near my work in Manhattan that has the best chicken platter and Sammy&#039;s just doesn&#039;t compare.

				Shangrlia has been pretty intermittent as of late, but thankfully they were there last night.&nbsp; He&#039;s always in the same spot though.<br /><br />The momo&#039;s are similar to chinese dumplings, but they&#039;re only steamed, they&#039;re bready-er (like it&#039;s real dough, and not a wonton skin) and stuffed with a more highly seasoned meat than the chinese.&nbsp; Also their hot sauce is really good (the owner makes it from scratch himself, along with the dumplings).<br /><br />

				Found Shangrila Express last night and got an order of momos and shambalays, with free chicken soup to boot.&nbsp; When I dug in, I was quite disappointed, maybe because it was hyped up a bit on this board and in other places.&nbsp; The momos look exactly like steamed Chinese potstickers (not wontons) on the outside, but lack the flavor punch of potstickers on the inside- where are the tiny slivers of onions, mushrooms, scallions, SALT AND SEASONING?&nbsp; The shambalays were not much better- they had the same bland meat inside.&nbsp; The sauce that came with both didn&#039;t help.&nbsp; It was very spicy (good) but somewhat bitter and I was surprised enough by that that I opted for my own soy sauce instead.&nbsp; The only thing I really liked was the chicken soup- very rich in flavor.&nbsp; I&#039;m not getting the overall appeal of this place, but to each his own.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				i&#039;ve had the shangrilla express but i dont really enjoy their food except for the momos. other than that its sammy&#039;s or the taco cart in front of the train station on roosey. the one called &quot;El Gallo Giro&quot; the only time i&#039;ve ever had tacos from the other cart was by mistake and those tacos arent good at all. you can taste that they&#039;re kind of cheap with their ingredients.

				I&#039;ve been a momo addict as long as Shangrila Express has been around.&nbsp; So I was happy to see a couple of new items added to their menu: Chele and Dopa Katsa.&nbsp; New adventures!<br /><br />Chele is described as dry, spicy beef served over rice. <br />The Dopa Katsa doesn&#039;t have any description at all.&nbsp; I had to taste that one first.<br /><br />I previously asked about the Dopa Katsa - what is it, and how is it served (in bread, over rice)?&nbsp; I was told that it was beef, that it was <em>very</em> spicy, and that it was served as a &quot;snack&quot; (not in portion size, but in eating style).&nbsp; Today I returned to order it.&nbsp; The person working today had no idea what I was asking for, and had to step out of the cart to see what I was pointing at.&nbsp; Once he understood, he prepared a generous portion of very spicy beef tripe.&nbsp; Tripe is not my thing, so I don&#039;t have much to compare it to, but I tried it and it was delicious.&nbsp; It&#039;s not very snack-like, so perhaps it is intended to be eaten as an appetizer.&nbsp; In any case, mystery solved.&nbsp; <br /><br />Next adventure: Chele... stay tuned!<br />

				If you&#039;re looking for a large selection of tropical fruits on a cart and don&#039;t mind a long walk, there&#039;s a guy who usually sets up on Northern Blvd. around 111th St. in Corona.&nbsp; The other day he had sugar cane at least 5 feet high, plus he had small bags of sugar cane pieces that he&#039;d stripped of the bark.&nbsp; Also papyas, a few kinds of mangoes and even a few things I didn&#039;t recognize.&nbsp; I bought chopped mango and it was the best (sweetest) I&#039;ve had from a cart so far this year.

				I&#039;ve been having some great quesadillas at a cart between 85th and 86th on Roosevelt. Spicy chicken with potatoes or just plain chicken. They&#039;re only around on the weekends, but they&#039;re delicioso.

				Grub Street has summarized an interview of Cesar Fuentes, vendor and spokesman for the Red Hook Food Vendors Committee in Red Hook, Brooklyn.&nbsp; Pork Chop Express blogger, J. Slab, sat down with Mr. Fuentes to address issues including the change from the use of the vendors&#039; traditional food tents to the new City mandated food trucks.&nbsp; Mr. Fuentes expresses concern over the higher costs associated with compliance with the City&#039;s new rules and how this may affect the Red Hook vendors.&nbsp; As a side note, when asked about his favorite tacos, Mr. Fuentes gives a thumbs-up to the taco trucks that line Roosevelt Avenue along the #7 train route.<br /><br />Grub Street Summary (http://nymag.com/daily/food/2008/06/summer_preview_red_hook_vendors.html)<br /><br />Pork Chop Express Blog (http://porkchop-express.blogspot.com/2008/06/red-hookd-interview.html)<br /><br />

				Guys...you guys are brave.&nbsp; I would never buy food from a Cart.&nbsp; <br /><br />Word of warning...most of you know where Sammy&#039;s Cart is, always on the Broadway side close to the corner with 73rd Street.&nbsp; On the 73rd Street corner close to Broadway, there is another cart that only leaves once a week to clean his cart.&nbsp; He is there 24/7.&nbsp; This particular one, besides the cleanliness, he stores all his plates and extra food in his blue-ish green van which is usually parked right by his cart.&nbsp; The food in his van is not refrigerated and we have called the Fire Department a few times on him because he would keep extra propane gas tanks in his car ( about 6 at a time ) which was hazardous.&nbsp; We&#039;ve talked to the Health Department&nbsp; a few times in reference to his practices. Last February he was contacted by the Health Department and was ordered to leave, but he is back with the same practices.&nbsp; So watch what you eat!!!

				As a fan and frequent customer of food carts, I find the are equally as professional in their food handling practices as their indoor counterparts (at least those quick-preparation places where you can watch your meal being made).&nbsp; <br /><br />That said, while I enjoy watching my meal being prepared, but certainly understand why some may find it unappetizing.&nbsp; Sausage-making is a metaphor for a reason.

				Well, the teriyaki cart appears to have given up and departed for a less-competitive location.<br /><br />But two of our street vendors were written up in the Daily News yesterday...<br /><br />The Daily News<br />Get your fast food fix with these 7 great street eats (http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/food/2008/06/29/2008-06-29_get_your_fast_food_fix_with_these_7_grea.html)<br />BY RACHEL WHARTON<br />Saturday, June 28th 2008, 4:00 AM<br /><br />In New York, summer is the time to hit the streets - and we mean for the food. Thanks to stalls, stands, trucks and carts, our city is an international outdoor food court of roast pork tacos, Ecuadoran ceviches, sauerkraut-topped German wursts and jerk chicken. Need help with a plan of action? Start with this must-visit list. <br /><br />1. Tacos Guichos: One of several taco trucks along Jackson Heights&#039; main drag of street food, Guichos&#039; tacos are always a steal (think roast pork or griddle-seared crispy chicken). Regulars also opt for their sopes, the thick little corncakes topped with Mexican sour cream and beans. But the strip is a street-smart foodie fave, thanks to the fact that you can take a seat in the mini-park nearby. Gleane St. and Roosevelt Ave., Queens, no phone<br /><br />...<br /><br />5. Mini-Picanteria el Guayaquileno: Don&#039;t let another July go by without trying the sweet shrimp in this massive mobile unit&#039;s Ecuadoran ceviche. Served up in a portable plastic tub and doused with a tomato-lime broth, it screams summer. Top it off with crushed plantains or toasted corn or a squeeze of vinegar, lemon juice and hot sauce. Tuesdays through Sundays at 80th St. and Roosevelt Ave., Queens, no phone.<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

				This is intriguing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t watch or know much at all about the show Top Chef.&nbsp; But this article (http://eater.com/archives/2008/07/eater_call_to_action_recruiting_top_chef_season_5_spies.php) mentions that in an earlier season, there was a &quot;street vendor challenge.&quot;&nbsp; And it speculates about Jackson Heights being a possible location for another such challenge in the upcoming season.&nbsp; Could this possibly mean an army of &quot;top chefs&quot; setting up carts in our neighborhood to compete for who can serve up the best street food?&nbsp; That would just about be the coolest thing imaginable.&nbsp; Please, anybody in the TV biz: Keep your ears to the ground and let us know if something like this is in the works!

				So not in Jackson Heights, but I tried going to the Red Hook ballfields this past weekend to get a bite to eat.&nbsp; All the vendors were lined up along the sidewalk and the lines were looonnggggg.&nbsp; Since this was my first attempt there, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s always that crowded.&nbsp; My understanding is that in previous years, the vendors would actually set up shop on the fields rather than sidewalks.&nbsp; I suppose that since the new DOH changes have been implemented, they have to stay off the grass?

				While driving by the Walgreen&#039;s on Northern Blvd. and 78th Street late Friday evening, I noticed one of those silver food vendor trucks parked near the entrance.&nbsp; Anyone know what type of food he/she&#039;s selling?&nbsp; There were a few customers on line.

				The great Jim Leff marvels (http://jimleff.blogspot.com/2008/11/why-people-read-restaurant-reviews.html) that his Obscure Street food in Eastern Jackson Heights (http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=115495487393878104919.00000111c286a9eac4500) map remains so popular (95,000 hits and counting) after it has long since fallen out of date.&nbsp; (It&#039;s because nobody else has attacked this important topic with such dedication, and because the Internet is forever.&nbsp; People will still be reading his street food map centuries from now, when humanity has long since departed Earth for greener planets.&nbsp; Historians will be sifting through the archives of Chowhound and JH Life to make sense of our society.&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">Howdy up there!</span>)<br /><br />So let&#039;s look smart... Anybody interested in collaborating on an updated version?<br />

				I have long heard rumors of a roast suckling pig cart along Roosevelt in the 80&#039;s, but I have never found it.&nbsp; Today, I found myself exploring further east than usual, and I found an amazing scene around the <strong>southeast corner of Warren Street and Roosevelt</strong> (Warren is between 95th Street and Junction Blvd.).&nbsp; There were seven food trucks there, each serving Peruvian and Ecuadorian food, with lots of people crowded around.&nbsp; Three of the trucks were serving roast pork.&nbsp; For $10, I got a delicious plate of roast meat, with sides of steamed hominy, roasted hominy, mashed potatoes (or yams?), and yummy giant lima beans.&nbsp; I think you can get a smaller platter without the sides for $8, but they&#039;re well worth it.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be back to explore more of their offerings.

				the quesadillas are your best bet, really. i rhink tacos huejotzingo -- the cart closest to the corner of 75th directly in front of the subway -- makes the&nbsp; greatest variety, including zucchini, mushroom, huitlacoche and plain old cheese, the cart in front of the chase diagonally across roosevelt sells chalupas. three for two bucks. basically a spicy sauce, no meat, lettuce and mexican cheese. they make for a good snack.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=35.msg20697.html#msg20697">Quote from: C11106 on July 29, 2009, 02:21:39 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />What else does not have meat?&nbsp; I know arepas do not, if you get them plain with butter or cheese.&nbsp; Which carts have vegetarian versions of other foods?&nbsp; Tacos?&nbsp; Tamales?&nbsp; Quesadillas, etc. etc?&nbsp; I feel like most of the carts only list meat items, or I&#039;m not sure what something is, so I don&#039;t order it because it may contain&nbsp; meat...&nbsp; The halal carts seem to be exclusively meat, correct?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
