				Can&#039;t say I&#039;m surprised!&nbsp; I know many of you like it but I found it filthy and got sick every single time I ate there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how long they&#039;ll be closed but they have paper up covering the windows.&nbsp; I made the mistake of stopping into the new grocery attached to them and the eagle theater.&nbsp; Oh my god, it is disgusting in there!&nbsp; I didn&#039;t touch a thing and ran out in horror.&nbsp; Why would anyone shop there when there are 10 other options on the same block is beyond me.

				it&#039;s the third or fourth time they&#039;ve been closed -- the only other places in the area that have been nailed as often are ricky&#039;s and paradise biriyani pointe. i don&#039;t like eating in kabab king, but i do like their meats and have never gotten sick. i tend to give a place two strikes, no more, so i understand what you&#039;re talking about...

				Someone here rasied a good point the last time I complained about getting sick there - she mentioned I might just not react well to mustard oil, which they use often.&nbsp; I have a feeling that might be part of the problem.

				&nbsp;It may just be a feeling but I do think the energy and interest for Indian and Pakastani foods is waning here and <br />a new food scene is about to advance. Tibetans seem to be making big strides for the JH food audience and reviews<br />are much better than for some of the tired and unhealthy older restaurants along the 74th st area. If Kabab King <br />closes, it might be the tipping point.

				I frequent Kebab King often but only for the chicken kebab (take out) which are exceptional especially since they do a enormous volume so they&#039;re always fresh.&nbsp; Actually, I went on Sunday evening and they were closed as a result of the Health Department.&nbsp; Kebab King does a huge business and everytime that I visit its alway extremely busy so they&#039;re not going out of business.&nbsp; It appears to be the busiest restaurant in the area.&nbsp; If any business will close it could be the Jackson House where business is way off especially during the week.&nbsp;

				Since Mehfil closed, we don&#039;t eat Indian in the neighborhood anymore. There&#039;s a nice place, just under the 7 at the Court Square stop called Aan Chal. Everything we&#039;ve eaten there has been just excellent. No liquor license, but BYOB is encouraged, they have wineglasses, pilsner glasses, corkscrews and bottle openers!<br /><br />http://aanchallic.com/about-us<br />
