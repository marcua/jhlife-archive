				My husband and I loved going to Himalayan Yak at 72-20 Roosevelt Ave, but they closed some time in December for &quot;renovation,&quot; according to a worker coming out of the building. I was told they were going to reopen after Christmas, but here it is March and the metal gate is still down every time I pass by.&nbsp; There is no answer at their phone number, but it hasn&#039;t been disconnected.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know whether or not they will return?&nbsp; We miss them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />JHNY

				This is terrible news.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t made it to that corner of the neighborhood in a while, and actually just this week walked by and saw that Himalayan Yak was closed.&nbsp; I checked on Chowhound, but didn&#039;t see any reference to it closing, so I convinced myself that they must just be closed on Tuesdays.&nbsp; But now with your report that they&#039;ve been closed since December, I fear the worst.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(<br /><br />If it doesn&#039;t reopen, then together with Burmese Cafe that&#039;s two tremendous loses for the JH foodie scene!<br />

				Okay, here&#039;s the definitive Word on the Street (at least in the vicinity of Shangrila Express)!<br /><br />One person I spoke with said he was pretty sure that Himalayan Yak is genuinely closed for remodeling.&nbsp; He thinks they are planning to expand and renovate their space.<br /><br />The other person I spoke with said he thought that it had closed for good.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a way they can both be right, if the restaurant is planning to move into a new, larger space elsewhere in the area.<br /><br />In any case, the results are inconclusive, and more research is necessary (especially if it involves momos!).

				Thanks for letting us know the results of your research.&nbsp; I think there&#039;s another Himalayan place in the neighborhood, maybe between 73rd &amp; 74th, or 72nd &amp; 73rd, one block north of Roosevelt, before 37th Ave.&nbsp; Maybe they would know what&#039;s going on with Himalayan Yak.&nbsp; If I can find the place and check in there, I&#039;ll let you know.&nbsp; I keep hoping to run into one of the service staff on the street to ask them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, maybe we should picket in front of the closed restaurant with signs that say, &quot;Bring Back the Yak!&quot;<br /><br />JHNY

				So the other day walking from the train on 37th road to 74th street I noticed Kababish is &quot;closed for renovations&quot;, but there&#039;s a Nepalese place that replaced the old Pizzeria (which was only good for a 4am &quot;drunk slice - and even then it was a little dodgy).&nbsp; I&#039;m always looking to try something new to try in the nabe and the little I&#039;ve had from there has been really good.&nbsp; The chicken and beef momo&#039;s are really fresh and yummy, and I had some super spicy potato dish as well.&nbsp; Can&#039;t wait to try more from them - any suggestions on good nepalese dishes I should check out?

				Post by: <strong>Shelby2</strong> on <strong>March 16, 2008, 06:28:51 PM</strong>
			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				Just wondered if anyone has been to this place?<br /><br />Walking back from Zabb the other night I noticed <strong>Om Tibet</strong> on 73rd just off of Roosevelt.&nbsp; I opened the door to find a cozy-looking place with a tiny bar and several small tables.&nbsp; Picked up a menu for future reference.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember ever hearing anyone mention it, and a search on chowhound from the past year brings up no hits.<br /><br />Yet I did find a few blogs with photos such as Eating in Translation (http://www.eatingintranslation.com/2006/01/om_tibet.html) and Project Me (http://www.project-me.com/2007/12/om-tibet.html)<br /><br />The writer of the latter blog also wrote this review in NYMag (http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/om-tibet/)<br /><br />&quot;Tavern-like from the outside, Om Tibetâ€™s dark faÃ§ade punctuated by a neon beer sign gives little indication of the calm that lies within. The first thing diners see upon entering is a photo of the Dalai Lama peering over the back counter. Images of Lhasaâ€™s famous Potala Palace are repeated across the ochre walls, and hushed world beat music is randomly punctuated by jarring bands such as the Scorpions. The food, too, alternates between mellow and wilder flavors. Traditional yak meatâ€”from the shaggy-haired bovineâ€”has been replaced with more accessible stand-ins, beef and lamb. Simple, fortifying thenthuk, hand-pulled noodle soup with daikon, wilted spinach, and sparse slices of beef contrast with the palate-tingling shapta special, spice-coated rectangles of beef stir-fried with wedges of jalapeÃ±o, red onions, and tomatoes. Both can be eaten with fluffy tingmos, steamed rolls that are favored over rice. Momos, steamed crescent-shaped dumplings filled with meat or vegetables, are treated as a main course, though non-Tibetans might enjoy sharing a plate to start. Fortunately, the only place yak products show up is in steaming mugs of bocha, a salty, yak-buttered tea that eerily tastes like popcorn.&quot;

				I really miss Burmese Cafe. Their steamed fish curry was one of my favorites in the neighborhood (actually, make that, the city). I sort of sense that maybe they just weren&#039;t quite busy enough -- it was busy right after the Village Voice review but, after that, was rarely full. And I&#039;m not sure if they did any delivery at all.

				I will miss Ashoka.&nbsp; It was only one of two places I consistently went to for their buffets (the other being Indian Taj).<br />Has anyone been to the Nepali restaurant on 37th Road between 74th and 75th?&nbsp; There are possibly two side by side- my memory is very bad.&nbsp; There&#039;s also the one that&#039;s by the subway, also on 37th Road, that seems to serve more snackish stuff, and the one right on 74th between Roosevelt and 37th Road that has a sign proclaiming it has Nepali food.&nbsp; They&#039;re popping up amazingly fast and I&#039;m seeing a lot more what I believe to be Nepali folks chatting away in this intersection when I get off the subway.&nbsp; Maybe they are establishing a kind of Little Tibet here?&nbsp; I would never have thought that another culture would be able to infiltrate this slice of Little India but that&#039;s what seems to be happening.&nbsp; Is this history in the making?

				Compared with some other subregions nearby, this isn&#039;t the most &quot;exciting&quot; cuisine.&nbsp; Its flavors just aren&#039;t as strong or as complex.&nbsp; But there are still some delicious things to be tasted: just wait for Himalayan Yak to reopen!&nbsp; I can never remember what dishes I ordered previously, so it has been a bit of a random guess each time, and I&#039;ve mostly been pleased with what I&#039;ve ended up with.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t like the tea either, but I can see how it would be a comfort food once you grow accustomed to it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been meaning to try the new buffet in Woodside called &quot;Top of the World&quot; ... if the food is any good, it could be a good way to taste a lot of different dishes in one sitting.

				I&#039;ve been to Himalayan Yak before and left the ordering to my Tibetan friend. But personally, tingmos, thantuk and momos just aren&#039;t very exciting for me. Anything vaguely spicy is Nepali or Indian, like the dhaal bhaat, which was pretty good.<br />I totally understand why Tibetan cuisine isn&#039;t strong or complex - it is a product of its geographic insularity, after all. Tibetan cuisine is also very dependent on the yak for protein and fat purposes, and yak isn&#039;t very well-represented on Himalayan Yak&#039;s menu. Hopefully the new place will have more yak dishes, like the yak burger (and yak milkshake) I had in Tibet!

				Okay, here&#039;s a report on Round 1 of the Great Jackson Heights Momo Showdown.&nbsp; Jeff is right, &quot;Himalaya Fast Food&quot; has very, very yummy momos.&nbsp; According to our highly precise scoring system, the filling of their beef momos scores contains exactly as many yummy units per momo as the Shangrila Express Food Cart.&nbsp; Amazingly, the panel of expert judges flown in from the Beijing Olympics to review this on an emergency basis concluded that the Himalaya Fast Food hot sauce was just as mind-blowingly excellent as the Shangrila Express Food Cart hot sauce, but awarded the newcomer one bonus point for originality since it their sauce is completely different from any of the other delicious hot sauces offered in the competition.&nbsp; However, the judges docked H.F.F. one point for using an uninspired momo skin resembling a commonplace Chinese dumpling, which falls short of the more distinctive, doughier momo skins used by the food cart.<br /><br />So after one round of competition we have a draw!&nbsp; Stay tuned for round two, the freestyle competition, when H.F.F. will compete with its daring chicken momos.<br /><br />

				I went to Mustang/Thakali the week it re-opened as Nepali &amp; Tibetan only.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was awkward because several people came in and promptly left when they were told there was no Indian food.&nbsp; That being said I thought it was excellent and I have gotten delivery from there since. The food is stylistically a bit different than Himalyan Yak, but I think on the same level quality-wise.

				Hey all,<br /><br />NYT gave a shout-out to JH today in relation to Losar and Tibetan cooking (see link below).<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/momos-tibetans-forbidden-special-treat.html?pagewanted=2<br /><br />The article mentioned a Norling Tibet Kitchen, for which I cannot find any information online.&nbsp; Does anyone have any clue where it is located and care to share your general thoughts?<br /><br />Thanks.

				betting on good results. the last three places in this space -- all tibetan -- have been good to very good.<br /><br />my one head scratcher about that times article? beef momo are on menu at most places in this area, not forbidden and not even surprising -- most places have beef dishes, from stir-fries to the awesome beef heart at himalayan yak. i don&#039;t know exactly what the journalist in question was thinking.

				In the article - That statement about Norling having the best momos in the neighborhood was out of nowhere. I have a feeling her writing was hacked up by the editor. The ones from Tsampa in manhattan looked good though!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been able to figure out yet, which styles are why they are - re: crescent and full moon shaped dumplings. Which regions are where...<br />Bhims and tawa foods have outstanding crescent shaped ones. lali guras and merit are pretty good too. I am not a huge fan of phayul&#039;s, and couldnt care less about the patola cart. <br />ohh, the place with what used to be spicy mina, now called woodside cafe, does fried momos... I organized a meal there... hold on, here&#039;s the link... http://malanddisexcellentadventure.tumblr.com/post/16979920579/nepalese-ambassador-in-jackson-heights actually, they aren&#039;t fried here. but you can get em!

				The new sign Norling Tibet Kitchen went up today at Noon.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any customers inside the 74th Street entrance (large Formal Dining Room) but it was early in the day.&nbsp; Later at about 1PM, I went to the 73rd Road entrance walked in and the rear was crowded.&nbsp; The menu is posted at the counter on two pieces off paper.&nbsp; I noticed that everyone was having the Momo&#039;s.&nbsp; I was meeting someone nearby for lunch so I didn&#039;t stay.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve liked all the places that have rentede space from the tawa bread ladies - this is really just a small part of the bread store that&#039;s being sublet (the way samudra was trying to do, much to the dismay of some here). This is good stuff. Hope they don&#039;t get overwhelmed, since three parties at a time would swamp them)

				lots of the himalayan places have a bhutanese menu (I know for sure Wasabi Point and GangJong), but this has always been variations of the dish erma datse - which is what the new place is called. I&#039;m looking forward to finding out other dishes at the dedicated restaurant.

				Phayul is my favorite. I only ever get the potato dumplings there, but I like them so much that I can&#039;t ever bring myself to order anything else. Has anyone else gotten any good potato momo&#039;s anywhere? AKA alu momo or possibly shogo momo? The cart on the nearside of diversity plaza had them, but they are often sold out or there is no in the cart or some other random situation that prevents me from grabbing them on my way home from the subway.
