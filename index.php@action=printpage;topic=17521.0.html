				where are you? <br /><br />i hate those days, but i am at 35/76 and have had a rare quiet day -- the road work has been going on on our block for more than a week, with only one lane open on 35th, and it&#039;s been brutal.

				I&#039;m on 80th Street, but felt like I could hear the horns ALL over the neighborhood this afternoon.&nbsp; I thought I was going to have to put my apartment on the the market and move to Idaho.&nbsp; It just wouldn&#039;t stop.&nbsp; Thank goodness it&#039;s quiet now and I have regained my sanity.......for the time being.

				Is there even a remote possibility that someone takes this problem seriously? Noise pollution is a scourge in urban life ; it degrades the environment, it makes people angry, it raises blood pressure, it creates the context for road rage and it is so unnecessary. Most of the time a jam is unavoidable and no one&#039;s fault. Sitting on the horn doesn&#039;t solve the problem of traffic.<br /><br />I hope the political class takes some notice of this blight. Perhaps signs with warnings and fines for offenders(with enforcement!)might make the worst polluters know there is penalty for this behavior.

				the signs were very nicely designed. great street furniture. <br /><br />we had one outside our kitchen window -- first floor, on 35th avenue. on many, many occasions, i watched a cop park directly under the sign for a long while and watch as dozens and dozens of cars honked endlessly. <br /><br />the signs did as much good as the laws against double parking do. <br /><br />(this is meant as a rant about police enforcement, not the OP&#039;s post asking for police enforcement, just to be clear).

				The lack of any valuable traffic enforcement in our neighborhood is a key contributor. Have traffic studies been done recently? I am just an occasional driver, but as a pedestrian and cyclist, I find it hard to believe anyone can travel by car here. We should call for a traffic study of the the 37th, 35th, Northern, Roosevelt corridor, which would include the impact of for-hire vehicles. <br /><br />The neighborhood is clogged beyond belief and double parking and circling blocks looking for parking are making it a quality of life issue. Also, as I walk blocks, I look at the number of out of state license plates and it averages about 7-10 per block. <br /><br />Over the weekend I decided that we have a coveted restaurant neighborhood that people drive to from other neighborhoods. We also have too many food delivery services such as Fresh Direct, and probably an addiction to on-demand shopping such as Amazon. <br /><br />It has gotten worse. I&#039;m happy to live in a neighborhood others travel too, but there are opportunities to improve how they travel and park here. Schools with parking, such as I.S. 145, 89, and others could offer spots. The BID could offer a shuttle from subway. We could have taxi stands... <br /><br />But enforcement is lacking and its causing a hell of a lot of unnecessary angst. And honking!

They had a worker with a telling drivers they couldn&#039;t pass!! I thought that was quite brazen of them!

				True that many people travel to the markets of lower JH. It&#039;s wonderful we have those markets. But the business owners should be part of the solution. Subzi Mandi is very bad at having loading trucks there at all hours. <br /><br />How busy is the parking lot at Elmhurst Hospital on a weekend? Surely it could be incentivized by restaurants and markets.

				i hope you&#039;re right about a solution being possible. i&#039;ve lived in nyc since 1981, on the LES, in Greenpoint, Bed Stuy, Flatbush, South Brooklyn, Astoria and Jackson Heights, and had one reasonably quiet place -- in Flatbush, where we were three doors south of Prospect Park on a dead end street. <br /><br />you&#039;re correct that working towards a solution is certainly better than simply complaining, though.<br />maybe we could alter car design to make horns run on horn fluid (like brakes or transmissions) :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17521.msg83934.html#msg83934">Quote from: E train on February 16, 2018, 11:09:30 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m not sure whether there is any energy in this issue given some of the replies.
