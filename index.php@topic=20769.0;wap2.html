			That should read &quot;gone&quot;, not &quot;goan&quot; which would be delicious if JHlife was turned into a coconut curry. Alas....<br /><br />I loathe facebook. Nextdoor seems scummy. <br /><br />I recommend the somewhat moribund - for NOW - r/jacksonheights on reddit. <br /><br />https://old.reddit.com/r/jacksonheights/

			funny, i loathe reddit for its complicity in so much political mishegas. and i like FB because of the transparency. i&#039;d like to see a new message board, but that is such a 20th century format.....

			Facebook transparency? HAHAHAHA!!! I just spit out my egg nog. I don&#039;t seem to find reddit being talked about much with regard to anti-vaxing, capitol rioting, voter frauding, and outright complete disinformation. Reddit should be fine. It would be a tiny neighborhood forum on a moderated site that doesn&#039;t relentlessly data-mine its users.. not a toxic echo chamber of conservative memes and racist tropes on a site created by a sociopath.

			My guess is that in the future we will send video clips of ourselves speaking our comments. Like a combination between YouTube and a forum like this.<br /><br />That will decrease misunderstandings....and will allow folks to immediately gauge...the rational or irrational state of the poster. Also less hiding behind being anonymous. Sure there&#039;ll be filters and voice changers and AI voices and avatars&nbsp; but it&#039;ll make being anonymous more difficult.<br /><br />Looking forward to that. <br /><br />I do agree that this style of a forum has reached its use-by date. It was great.&nbsp; But there will be more visual video ways to interact...and that&#039;ll be exciting. Here&#039;s to the future!
