				My name is Samina Quraishi and I am a licensed acupuncturist. I run a community acupuncture clinic, called Queens Acupuncture, located in Astoria. Below is a little blurb that explains a little about my clinic which is different than most other acupuncture clinics. I am trying to keep rates affordable and build a sustainable practice that allows me to treat patients in need of help with whatever they have going on--stress, pain, migraines, infertility, anxiety, depression...the list goes on. Feel free to send me an email or call me for a free consultation.<br /><br />Queens Acupuncture is a community acupuncture clinic in the diverse neighborhood of Astoria, NY. Our sliding scale is $20 - $40, plus a $10 paperwork fee. It is for you to decide what you can afford to pay. The purpose of our sliding scale is to separate the issues of money and treatment; we want you to come in often enough to really get better and stay better! We understand that everyone&#039;s situation is different, and our primary goal is to make acupuncture available to you as often as you need it.<br /><br />Our aim is to make acupuncture and wellness resources accessible to people at all income levels and cultural backgrounds. We are a part of a movement to create social change in American health care called Community Supported Acupuncture (CSA), a model that empowers patients, builds community and breaks down class divisions. Acupuncture can be part of the solution to the soaring cost of healthcare â€“ if it is affordable and accessible to everybody. Queens Acupuncture helps make this possible.<br /><br />Samina Quraishi, L.Ac.<br />22-08 Crescent St. (off of Ditmars Blvd.)<br />Astoria, NY 11105<br /><br />(917) 940-4639<br />samina@queensacupuncture.com<br />www.queensacupuncture.com

				It&#039;s great to have a place to go get acupuncture and not pay the the higher prices that some other places charge.&nbsp; One place i have visited was charging 85 dollars per treatment.&nbsp; Acupuncture has helped me a lot with stress and I am happy with queens acupuncture.&nbsp; I definitely would recommend this place to other people.
