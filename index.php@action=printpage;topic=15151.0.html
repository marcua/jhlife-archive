				I truly hope it works for Barcelona. Let&#039;s see:<br /><br /><em>In the first phase of the plan, which is now being implemented in a few areas, the maximum speed on the roads within the Superblock is limited to 20 km/h (12.5 miles per hour). Phase one of the Superblocks can be implemented easily, at low cost, mainly through the changing traffic signals</em><br /><br />Well, <strong>since NYC has had so much success </strong>with vision zero and enforcing 20-30mph speed limits, we should skip straight to this idea!<br /><br />inb4 &quot;but you&#039;re so negative&quot;

				One of the problems is JH has been overbuilt over the past 40 years or so, hence we have no sizable public park space, congested traffic, crowded sidewalks among other things.&nbsp; The idea is to re-vision our neighborhood.&nbsp; We are very lucky to have so many mass transit options e.g. many subway lines/bus routes in JH.&nbsp; Whatever we can do to cut down on traffic and open up space for people I think would be a step forward.&nbsp; This is not an anti-car idea.&nbsp; Parking solutions are possible.&nbsp; Perhaps a neighborhood parking garage on Northern (?)&nbsp; We don&#039;t need to think in terms of the car being the center of our community that we have to work around.&nbsp; This is about the quality of life on the street.&nbsp; It would be nice if we could actually begin a dialogue on how we would like to see how our neighborhood should evolve/improve.&nbsp; In its creation JH was a planned community.&nbsp; Now it has become a hodge podge of buildings with little planning.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I am interested to see how this plays out in Barcelona.&nbsp; Our situation is different here, as our blocks are much longer than theirs, so a 3 block grid would require a car to drive over a half a mile, while Barcelona&#039;s would only require a bit less than a half a kilometer to cover 3 blocks.&nbsp; It also seems to me that the number of cars on the road is less.&nbsp; Just got back from a roadtrip in Spain and their streets seem less packed and their highways are wonderfully empty.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t drive in Barcelona, but stayed in Poblenou for a week in 2012 (where the plan is suggested) and I just didn&#039;t see the awesome number of cars that we have.&nbsp; Even Gran Via in Madrid didn&#039;t seem to have as many cars as we have along Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; I&#039;m skeptical, but hopeful on this one.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would like to explore:<br />1.&nbsp; Higher gas taxes.&nbsp; Gas over there is about $1.50 a liter, so that&#039;s 6 bucks a gallon.&nbsp; Raise the price of gas to that and that would encourage folks to seek out alternate transport.&nbsp; The taxes raised can goto mass transit.&nbsp; It always grates me to see how cities much smaller than ours over there constantly building transit while we have barely built anything since we finished up the IND&#039;s before the war.<br />2.&nbsp; SUV taxes.&nbsp; True, folks in JH need SUV&#039;s for all of the off-roading they do, but those things take up so much space and burp out so much pollution.<br />3.&nbsp; Encourage scooters/motorcycles with dedicated parking.<br />4.&nbsp; Make 37th Avenue car free along the lines which JackM noted.&nbsp; This works well over there, even in neighborhoods (non-city centers) like ours.&nbsp; Avienda de Carlos III in Pamplona is a good example.&nbsp; Rambla de Poblenou allows cars, but no parking and it makes for a wonderful pedestrian area.&nbsp;

If more people live in a given area, they can support a higher density of stores and amenities, which means any given person has a shorter distance to travel to reach what they need, which means cars are less necessary. High density also makes public transit more economically feasible, and makes the streets safer to walk in because there are simply more people around. You can fight car dominance, or you can fight &quot;overbuilding,&quot; but you can&#039;t really fight both at the same time.<br /><br />I realize this is kind of a tangent, but I think a lot of people are misguided on this issue and wanted to offer a different perspective.

				We need to begin to think of cities in terms of people and not cars.&nbsp; Cars have their place but it is primarily in the suburbs and exurban communities were everything is spread out.&nbsp; The suburbs were designed for the car.&nbsp; Urban areas were designed for people but somehow, along the way, we tried to squeeze suburban transportation options into tight, congested cities that were never designed for cars.&nbsp; Consequently, our mass transit systems have suffered.&nbsp; They are deteriorating and few new mass transit systems are being built or expanded especially here in NYC.&nbsp; I would love to see a re-visioning of our city putting people at the center of urban planning, renewal, and expansion.&nbsp; The more people who move into our city (and that&#039;s a good thing) the more we need to plan our space better.&nbsp; Cars simply take up more space than people.&nbsp; They require huge swaths of areas to move (streets/roads), spaces for parking etc.&nbsp; Just the car itself takes up so much more square footage than a human.&nbsp; They have become traveling mini-houses.&nbsp; Anyway, let the dialogue begin.&nbsp; &nbsp;
