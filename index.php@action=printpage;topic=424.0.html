				Recently I have seen an increase in the amount of graffiti in the neighboorhood . I was surprised when i saw it on a building on 35th and 79th a believe in the side of the building in purple . Also on the side walls from 87th to 84th facing 37th ave the graffiti just keeps mounting on . All by the same two or three vandals, they have also &quot;tagged&quot; the &quot;Feel Beauty&quot; supply store on 37th and 84th on the tiling under the windows . This has been there for weeks and they have not cleaned it. The times i wait for the bus I always see the &quot;easel&quot; as i like to call it on 37th and 82nd constantly be &quot;tagged&quot; on time after time the JHBG cleans it along, with the massive graffiti on the roof and side walls of the beautiful buildings on 82nd . For the &quot;easel&quot; my solution would be to install tasteful but, bright lights on the wall and it would be my dream that a picture such as the one they have in the two Commerce Banks to go there . This being an aheisive one such as the ones that wraps some buses , cars , and windows .&nbsp; The same with the lights on the roofs on 82nd st . Is there some possible way of making this happen I know that the JHBG does a lot of cleaning up and that there is The 82nd Street Business Improvement District . As for The 82nd Street Business Improvement District the only work i see done is the Christmas lighting and such which is very nice , but for the improvement of 82nd st very little . Is there anyway to get any of these plans into a realty ?&nbsp; I would be glad to help in anyway to make this happen .&nbsp; Thank You :)

				Some of the vandals are apparently mixing acid (which etches glass) into their spray paint.&nbsp; During the clean-up effort, the paint can be removed from the glass, but the glass remains etched with the tags.&nbsp; Obviously this is a huge problem, and has been city-wide for at least a few years since the trend started.

				Glass etching cream has a ph of less than 7 (I think the ph of Ammonium Biflouride, which is found in most commercially available glass etching creams, has a ph of ~2) which makes it an acid. When using glass etching cream, people should be in a well ventilated area, and avoid prolonged contact with the skin because you can get serious burns. This type of graffiti is destructive, and a common concern in urban areas, and there is really no need to be condescending.<br /><br />Here&#039;s some more information:<br />http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/engsvcs/streets/graffiti/acid_etching.htm

				I think he wanted to point out the mistake I made when I said the acid is mixed with the paint.&nbsp; After doing a bit more research on it I realized that this type of grafitti is &quot;painted&quot; on with acid, and there&#039;s no actual paint involved.&nbsp; And I have used acid to etch before, so I am sort of familiar with this - however, I have restricted my use to artwork that is within the law!

				Unfortunately seems like the city doesn&#039;t care, or some of the residents.If people wanted to get things done around here actions have to be made. Anyone can talk about change, its about making the change. If the roof top doors to the buildings around the 7 line were more protected something could be done. These vandals are just kids 14-17 years. Plus one can also call Vandal Squad who is also on the look out for graffiti. Thats just an idea.. =D

				About 2 years ago, our co-op had graffiti spray painted along the side of the building.&nbsp; The Graffiti Busters at JHBG were able to take care of it for us, but before doing so, they instructed us that for future incidents, it would be a good idea to provide the police with a photograph.&nbsp; This helps them in identifying TAGS spray painted by well-known gangs who may be trying to send each other messages via the graffiti.<br /><br />On a different occasion, I caught a couple of teens wanting to spray paint the 78th street side of the Berkeley co-op.&nbsp; There were 4 of them, no older than 15.&nbsp; I approached the corner and just stood there watching them until they decided to call it quits after 3 minutes of waiting around.&nbsp; As I walked toward 37th Avenue, I spotted a rookie officer and explained what I had seen.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the kids were long gone, but I was able to provide them with a good description, clothing as well.

				Does anyone know what happens to these kids that spray graffiti? What does the law say we can do? It bothers me so much to see people put in new fences or panels in front of their homes, or pay thousands for new brick and iron construction work, only to have it destroyed in a matter of days by these reckless kids. I hope they get jail time and I hope their parents are also held responsible and charged with steep fines. It&#039;s absolutely disgusting to see neighborhoods destroyed by these vandals.<br />-Shilu

				I am a teacher who works with the junior high students you refer to in your posts, and I&#039;d like to make a few points and suggest a possible solution.<br /><br />First, the use of &quot;these kids&quot; and &quot;they&quot; implicitly demonizes a large group of <span class="bbc_u"><strong>children</strong></span> in our neighborhood who are at a very impressionable age--one that takes others&#039; opinions very seriously.&nbsp; Kids this age are constantly looking for recognition from their peers, as well as from adults; a suspicious look on the sidewalk or a suggestion that &quot;they get jail time&quot; sends a very clear message: our community does not care about you.&nbsp; We teach children respect from kindergarten on though junior high, but they know that respect is conditional: we innately feel that we are obliged to give respect only when we receive respect in turn.&nbsp; I suspect that building a stronger sense of community between our neighborhoodâ€™s children and adults would foster mutual respect and make <span class="bbc_u"><strong>some</strong></span> potential vandals think twice before defacing public and private property.&nbsp; How to go about this, especially in a crowded neighborhood with very few facilities for community activities (youth sports, youth organizations, etc.) is a topic for another post.<br /><br />Note that I stressed the word â€˜someâ€™ above.&nbsp; We must realize that we cannot eliminate the graffiti problem altogether.&nbsp; Young adolescents have been vandalizing community property since the Stone Age; no doubt some of the more lewd Mesozoic cave painting found in France were the work of angst-ridden teens.&nbsp; While we can strive to provide alternative activities and a rich community life for teens, there will always be a few who do graffiti, egg houses, smash mail boxes, etc.&nbsp; Teenage rebellion is not a modern problem, an urban problem, a gang problem, a racial/cultural problem, or a class problem; it is as close as we have to a sociological fact.<br /><br />This brings me to my next point.&nbsp; APG7714&nbsp; seems to imply that our graffiti problem is imported from Corona (our poorer neighbors to the east), where many of the students that attend I.S. 145 (one of our neighborhoodâ€™s middle schools) live.&nbsp; This is inaccurate.&nbsp; Most of these young artists tend to paint and tag in their own neighborhoods where they can show off there work to their friends.&nbsp; The motive is not to destroy property, but to gain respect and rebel status within their peer group, which would not happen if their peers did not see their work.&nbsp; It is pure classism to suggest kids from another neighborhood are responsible for our graffiti because our teens happen to live in expensive co-ops.&nbsp; Anecdotally, last year I happen to have taught one notorious vandal who left his â€œsemiâ€ tag on every above ground surface within a three block radius from his homeâ€”the doorman building on 76th Street between 34th and 35th.<br /><br />I would also like to venture a suggestion to the community.&nbsp; Rather than demonize â€œthemâ€ for the fact that less than one percent of their peers occasionally wield a can of spray paint, why donâ€™t we use the youthful energy and community spirit of the other ninety-nine percent to clean up?&nbsp; When I polled my 7th grade students for potential community service projects, 75-percent of them recommended graffiti clean up.&nbsp; So, if those of you who hate looking at graffiti on your way to work every morning can provide the necessary supplies and supervision, I can have 100+ pairs of tireless young hands ready to wield buckets and scrub brushes on any given weekend.&nbsp; Not only would the kids love the opportunity to do something positive with their friends, but I think that you adults would benefit from a little personal interaction with a few of the thousands of the caring and vibrant young people in our community.<br /><br />Sincerely and in defense of the hundreds of talented and caring 11-15 year olds I work with every day,<br /><br />Steven Carpenter<br /><br />7th Grade Science Teacher<br />I.S. 145Q<br />Jackson Heights, NY

				To reiterate my point, the kids that I witnessed were indeed about to spray the side of the building.&nbsp; I saw as one of them actually removed the can of spray paint from underneath his shirt as he closed in on the black gate that&#039;s located on the 78th Street side of the Berkeley.&nbsp; His intention to use the spray paint was very clear.&nbsp; Then and only then did I make it evident to the kids that someone was watching their actions.&nbsp; The boys waited for me to leave, but I remained there and eventually they ran down the street while at the same time looking back at me.&nbsp; I strongly feel that if I can thwart this type of vandalism imposed on my fellow neighbors, I will continue to do so.&nbsp; The boys I caught in the act appeared to be more mischievous than criminals.&nbsp; Hence, my decision to stop them before they defaced the side of the building.

				Mr. C brought up a good point.&nbsp; Vandals who graffiti on private/public property in JH are not necessarily from poorer surrounding neighborhoods.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, I disagree with Mr. C on other points.<br /><br />First, I don&#039;t agree that the fostering of mutual respect and sense of community is needed to &quot;make some vandals think twice before defacing public and private property&quot;.&nbsp; Some people in your community may not respect you because of your age, race, economic status, etc, but that hardly gives you any justification to run out and destroy public/private property.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second, I don&#039;t agree that some vandalism should just be attributed to &quot;teenage rebellion&quot; and that the resulting graffiti problem cannot be eliminated altogether, even if we provide &quot;alternative activities and a rich community life&quot;.&nbsp; When these vandals destroy property (to &quot;gain respect and rebel status within their peer group&quot; as Mr. C suggests), they don&#039;t stick around to proudly showcase their &quot;art&quot;.&nbsp; They run away.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I submit that they run away because they understand the difference between legal and illegal activity.&nbsp; &quot;Teenage rebellion&quot; is not a defense to illegal destruction of property.&nbsp; To allow &quot;teenage rebellion&quot; to be some kind of defense or excuse for engaging in illegal activity is to insult (and disrespect) the sensibility and intelligience of teenagers.&nbsp; If caught in the act, the vandals (or their parents) should be made to pay for the clean up, not the community.&nbsp; If appropriate, the vandals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&nbsp; Teenage rebellion may spur vandals to destroy property, but it is not a defense for their action, and the community should not sit idly by and just proclaim that we cannot eliminate graffiti problems altogether.&nbsp;

				80thstreet,<br /><br />I did not mean to give the impression that I support, defend or find justification for the actions of the vandals.&nbsp; Defacing property is certainly criminal, and those caught should face some penalty (although I would not go as far as saying that teenagers should be booked and jailed).&nbsp; <br /><br />I merely wanted to move the discussion away from what I interpreted as the demonization of an entire subpopulation of our neighborhood for the actions of a tiny number of vandals.&nbsp; If this is a legitimate problem then we should be thinking of solutions, not simply complaining.<br /><br />The fact that graffiti remains an issue after the NYPD has spent 30+ years hunting down graffiti artists, tells me that if we want to live in a graffiti free neighborhood we cannot rely on catching and penalizing the vandals. The only other option we have is to clean it as fast as they paint it. I&#039;m offering one plausible way to get that done--enlisting some of the thousands of junior high students living here.&nbsp; At the same time I guess I&#039;m tentatively hoping that bringing kids in as part of the solution will create a certain amount of social pressure against graffiti, eventually reducing the amount of graffiti being produced.&nbsp; That, however, may be no more than wishful thinking.

				I work in a large high school near here and tagging is rampant.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had many conversations with students who&#039;ve been caught and they just don&#039;t get what&#039;s wrong about it.&nbsp; They (meaning the students I&#039;ve spoken to- not teens as a whole) don&#039;t understand the concept of respecting the property of others. What they&#039;re most upset about is having to take the time to go to family court.&nbsp; But in most cases, it doesn&#039;t stop them from doing it again.&nbsp; I&#039;ve observed that kids are very quick to touch, throw, destroy, and in the worst cases, steal others property without a second thought.&nbsp; They&#039;re even oblivious to personal space and are quick to touch each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of my colleagues attributed this to the fact that many of the students in our school live in crowded households where they don&#039;t have any personal space of their own.&nbsp; Often they have to share rooms with others, or even give up their rooms to elders.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I fully agree, but I can see how a kid so used to never having personal space or property wouldn&#039;t learn concept of respecting the property of others.&nbsp; And while I advocate teaching our kids these lessons through service learning projects, these lessons must also come from the parents.&nbsp; Most parents know where their kids are after school, but some don&#039;t, and it&#039;s likely that those kids are the ones tagging.&nbsp; I think looking at a child&#039;s notebook (where they often practice their tags) isn&#039;t that hard.&nbsp; I think everyone knows what a permanent marker and spray can look like, and that these items shouldn&#039;t be in a child&#039;s bookbag when he or she leaves for school.&nbsp; And of course there are kids who get these items from their friends and whatnot, but if vigilance were increased, then perhaps there would be a decrease in graffiti.&nbsp; It certainly couldn&#039;t hurt.

				There have always been impoverished kids in America, but they didn&#039;t always feel free to vandalize public and private property. Graffiti was once practically unknown in our cities; to suggest otherwise is simply not correct. The cultural upheavals of the &#039;60s and &#039;70s, which encouraged the abandonment of all behavioral standards, resulted in a huge proliferation of vandalism and even the perverse glorification of it as &quot;art&quot;. The term &quot;graffiti artists&quot; is especially telling in that connection.&nbsp; <br />

				Alley, you hit the nail on the head when you state that parent involvement is critical.&nbsp; Although from an entirely different era (early 70s), I am originally a child from the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx from the tender age of 2 until adolescence when we moved to Queens.&nbsp; Graffiti and all sorts of vandalism were rampant throughout this section of the Bronx at the time.&nbsp; I strongly believe my parents had a HUGE impact in why random acts of vandalism never crossed our minds.&nbsp; We were taught the concept of pride and sharing and modesty, to respect our household and the property of others.&nbsp; Your colleague&#039;s suggestion that lack of space may play a role in this is a little off mark.&nbsp; I, along with my 3 siblings, grew up sharing 1 bedroom.&nbsp; Talk about a lack of space!&nbsp; Nonetheless, when my sisters were given permission by my parents to use makeup, I was tempted by the mere presence of lipsticks, eye shadows, etc. sitting atop the dresser.&nbsp; I dared not touch, as I was taught to ask permission before taking.&nbsp; Prior to getting married, I shared a bedroom with my younger teen brother.&nbsp; No problems there either.&nbsp; I credit my parents for teaching us these values.

First of all Corona was never mentioned , not that it matters . Also , if some of these kids &quot;tag&quot; in there own neighborhood , A.) It is extremely disrespectful and inexcusable , B.) If they do it in there own neighborhood , where they actually live , why not in the neighborhood where they go to school where all of there friends will see it to and from to school&nbsp; . Also , if they could care less of their neighboorhood they live in by vandalizing it , why would they care about somewhere they don&#039;t live at all . Then again this does not refer to all of the students who attend these schools , since I know there are very hard workers in some of these school , this only refers to the small amount of vandals who damage the reputation of not only the school ,but, unfortunately the one of there peers.

				All this graffiti could be stopped if the laws on graffiti were harder and VS was actually around. Street Police officers honest don&#039;t care becuase well, they have other things to worry about. I think if one honestly wants to take initiative and make change and what not take Polaroid of the &quot;tags&quot; you see the most contact Vandal Squad and let them know about the kids around here Vandal Squad Hates graffiti and they get paid to do something about it.<br /><br />As for kids coming for other neighborhoods as corona, yes some do but even kids that are from other neighborhoods as well are part of the problem. Believe it or not the majority of graffiti artist these days are usually Caucasian, or from European decent. But to get back on topic.<br /><br />I think parents should be aware of what there kids are doing but some can&#039;t since they work late and they can&#039;t afford some sort of supervision of home so it pretty much becomes a cycle.<br />

				Heh. I mean not just in the streets i mean in the tunnels, bridges, and suicide spots.&nbsp; Some of the famous graffiti writer such as REVS, Smith, OBEY are all from Caucasian descent. If you watch Graffiti videos like, State your name the majority of the guys are white. I&#039;ve been there and i&#039;ve met many writers my life.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />My name is Andres Bermudez Lievano and I&#039;m a journalism student at Columbia University, covering Jackson Heights for my schoolwork all year. I&#039;m currently researching for an article on the wave of graffitis that have been troubling the neighborhood all year long and the efforts of people in the community to counter them. I have been reading your discussion on the topic, and it is very interesting.<br /><br />I would be really interested in personally speaking to whoever would be keen on it. I respectfully request this and don&#039;t mean to intrude on your discussion. I am honestly interested in the neighborhood and would like to speak with you about this issue. Most of the people I have spoken to around have just given me a flying impression, and none were committed to the topic and the neighborhood, which is what I&#039;m looking for.&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, you can send me a message and I will get in touch with you shortly.<br /><br />Thank you very much and I really hope it would be possible.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Andres

				I just wanted to say, I grew up in JHts and in the 80&#039;s graffiti was bad around the neighborhood.&nbsp; Kids would &quot;tag&#039; there names everywhere, the side of buildings, in the lobby&#039;s of the building and even on sidewalks.&nbsp; It was similar to the display you see on the # 7 train in LIC.&nbsp; I have to say I knew a lot of those kids doing the graffit and they came from good homes and went to Catholic and private schools.&nbsp; It really doesn&#039;t matter if the kid is from a broken home or not it usually is a kid acting out for attention.&nbsp; I agree with a lot of the things Mr.C wrote and I just wanted to say I knew someone who went to Rikers for displaying his graffiti.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how many times you have to get caught to make you go to jail but, I do know its a crime.<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to say JHts has come a long way and yes there still is a problem with the graffiti and it annoys me that this happens and right now there is graffiti on the side of my bldg and no matter how many times you clean it, they do it again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I hope they get caught and correct there problem.

				What I&#039;m concerned about is that when you leave graffiti without cleaning it up immediately (like the Feel Beauty Place), one starts getting the sense that people don&#039;t really care and anything is permissible. You get the feeling of being in a run-down place, a bad neighborhood. That&#039;s the reason why the few times our bldg was vandalized, we cleaned it within hours. <br /><br />I like Mr C&#039;s idea about involving local kids in the clean-up process. Is that viable? Any thoughts?
