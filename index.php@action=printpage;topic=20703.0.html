				Dear Folks:<br /><br />I was looking at a coop in JH with very strict rules about bikes, at least as written.&nbsp; Bikes are prohibited not only in the lobby and common areas and locked in front of the building but also in the elevators and on the stairs.&nbsp; They are allowed only in the bike room, which would be fine if it had much capacity, but it is small and already full, with a waitlist.&nbsp; This building is Hampshire House on 79th, by the way.&nbsp; If you have any experience with the building, please share.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to store my bike in the bike room, but if there&#039;s no space there, by the rules must I give it up entirely?<br /><br />What are the bike rules in your building?&nbsp; How strictly are they enforced?&nbsp; What the the hypothetical or real penalties for infractions of the house rules?

				Wow, that&#039;s something! The city has been moving towards more bike lanes since Bloomberg, and it&#039;s finally starting to happen in Queens, and this coop essentially bans bikes. What&#039;s the rules on electric scooters? Not exactly a forward thinking board of directors.

It seems there is still space for new bikes.&nbsp; In my new coop, I haven&#039;t found out the bike storage policy yet, but I am using the service elevator from the basement to move my bike.

				FYI, the bldg clarified that there is an auxiliary bike room with available space, so the bike room/bike rule matter at the building is resolved.
