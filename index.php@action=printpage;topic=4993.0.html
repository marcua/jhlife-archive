				Bellabella,<br /><br />There is Google advice on what to do with wild birds but, normally, they&#039;re better left to their parents and the parents will feed them even if they have fallen from the nest.&nbsp; If it is really young, try to put the box you now have it in near to where you found the bird and in a place where cats/raccoons, etc, can&#039;t get it.&nbsp; It&#039;s not easy to find such a place probably but see of you can.<br /><br />I believe there are also raptor rescue groups in the area and I&#039;ll do some research.&nbsp; Before you put it out, you might want to try to feed it some scraps of meat with&nbsp; tweezers or chopsticks.&nbsp; Young birds are ravenous eaters and they need to be fed often.<br /><br />Good luck and thanks for taking care of&nbsp; our local wildlife!<br /><br />Madalyn

				thanks!! I was on the phone all day with 311 and ACC and trying to contact rescuers I guess sundays are bad? anyhow we did bring it to the front hoping the mamma bird would come back (i read alot today) and there are ALOT of cats on my block and this little guy was going near the street and I just didn&#039;t feel comfortable leaving him for the night. We gave him some steak (he didn&#039;t eat it) and some water with a bit of sugar (he/she/ loved it) and are hoping tomorrow to either have mamma bird come or a rescuer. my hubby says its not a falcon but the kids and I think it is. anyhow I hope all ends well. I think I really should go back to school to become a vet considering Im bringing home all kinds of species on a weekly basis!

				It ain&#039;t always easy having a kind heart!<br /><br />This incident has made me wonder how one goes about becoming a certified wildlife rehabilitator.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s what we should do....I&#039;ll investigate.<br /><br />Madalyn

				bella, how&#039;s the chick? <br />I have tried to rescue birds (pigeons &amp; sparrows) that couldn&#039;t fly or fell/were pushed from the nest and can&#039;t remember being successful. Mostly I tried to put the bird back where it came from so can&#039;t say how that played out; but rearing them by hand failed as I remember.&nbsp;

				Hello, apparently the bird must have been learning to fly (fledging) and it gained its momentum and flew away. My son is heartbroken even though I told him we will NOT be keeping him. I am glad as we could not find anyone to help us.

				Bellabella,<br /><br />You probably got the bird after it&#039;s first flight.&nbsp; They often make crash landings until they get used to the flight-thing.&nbsp; I saw a young red-tailed hawk crash-land into a shrub once and it wasn&#039;t pretty!&nbsp; Took him (or her) some minutes to extricate himself but he was fine.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy things ended well, if not for your son, at least for the bird and its parents.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have to console your son with a brand new puppy or kitten now! ;D ;D ;D

				Oh I am sure he would love that considering we just got a new kitten not too long ago and countless other pets.... ay yay yay... I am done... Please lord.. No more kittens.. birds.. rabbits.. fish.. turtles.. dogs... I am done...&nbsp; Everyday is an adventure in our house. Your point was good I wonder how we could go about becoming rescuers? I often considered fostering but am afraid I&#039;d become too attached and then don&#039;t want to part with the animal.
