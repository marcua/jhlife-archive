				There is another new pizza place coming soon - this one is on 82nd St. on the Elmhurst side, about a half a block from the 82nd St. train station on the left, before you get to the Jackson Triplex.<br /><br />They are doing construction on the space, but the sign is up -- and it&#039;s a real sign, not one of the cheap awnings.<br />It says &quot;Mario&#039;s Pizza&quot; and when I googled, I found this http://www.mariospizzaonline.com/ but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the same place.&nbsp; All the existing ones within this chain on the website are on Long Island.

				Very interesting.&nbsp; Another new pizza place just a block from the recently opened Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to Louie&#039;s 4 times at lunch time and it&#039;s never that busy.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if the area can support another one and if Mario&#039;s is charging $2.25 (from the website) it had better be super great since Louie&#039;s charges $1.50.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that Mario&#039;s besides serving Pizza has Italian Hero Sandwiches both hot &amp; cold.&nbsp; Louie&#039;s is serving pasta dishes and I don&#039;t see many customers ordering.&nbsp;

				I appreciate the signage because I still play nintendo, but I don&#039;t have much hope for quality pizza.

				It&#039;s funny - I thought it must be the same as the chain on Long Island because all I had remembered from the signage of the one they are building here is that the &quot;o&quot; in Mario&#039;s was the shape of a pizza with a slice pulled out a little to form the apostrophe. &nbsp;Now, after seeing your photo, I realize that&#039;s the only commonality. &nbsp;Maybe if you are a pizza place with a name that ends with an &quot;o&quot; that little trick would be too hard to resist.

				Mario&#039;s opening Friday.&nbsp; Opening Special 2 Plain Slices &amp; Soda for $2.99.&nbsp; A regular slice is $1.25.&nbsp; Problem is seating.&nbsp; The place is small compared to Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; This place is ideal for those who are interested in take out.&nbsp; They also have breakfast.&nbsp; Breakfast special 2 eggs with home fries and coffee = $1.99.&nbsp;

				I happened to be in the area at 11:30. &nbsp;I counted 6 employees for this small place (2 in the kitchen). &nbsp;Seating is 4 small tables each seating 2. &nbsp;I had the margarita slice ($2) which was excellent. &nbsp;The pizza is on par with Louie&#039;s. &nbsp;Regular slice is $1.25. &nbsp;Many hot pasta choices for $3.50. &nbsp;Hot hero&#039;s with a beverage is $6. &nbsp;This place is perfect for someone who can eat out either at work or home. &nbsp;I&#039;m not certain about delivery but you can call 718 205 6860. &nbsp; Address is 40-25 82nd St.

				I went there today. I dig it. cheesy and sweet slice. really cheap too. <br />seems like it would be a chain, but im not sure. it&#039;s very clean and new. lots of people are working there, and they run it pretty well it seems. <br /><br />big menu. 1/2 lb burgers for 3 dollars... hmmm....<br /><br />the regular slice looked better than the ones with toppings. the chicken looks factory fresh. <br /><br />i don&#039;t know... louie better step up his game... mario&#039;s can&#039;t compete with the pasta, but does the neighborhood know this? and I haven&#039;t seem louie in months and months... where&#039;s he been?

				It&#039;s true that many here in JH will fall for Mario&#039;s which is one step up from frozen Jeno&#039;s pizza but I have confidence that there are&nbsp; some in JH who can see that Louie&#039;s is superior to Mario&#039;s in not only the pizza but their pasta and wonderfully fresh salmon but&nbsp; unfortunately there will always be some that prefer cheap over quality.........not me!

				The space at Mario&#039;s is very tight and uncomfortable, not to mention that it is a chain that I&#039;ve seen on Houston St. <br /><br />I would much rather support a family-owned, high quality place like Louie&#039;s where you&#039;re treated like family when you become a regular. Can&#039;t beat the restaurant quality dishes under $10, specialty slices packed with toppings with plenty of basil and garlic. Oh and not to mention the HANDMADE agnolotti and fettucini. <br /><br />Seems to me as if Mario&#039;s found a Louie&#039;s menu and priced their items just below that but at a fraction of the quality<br />

				The slice I had was excessively greasy and tiny. The crust was also way too crispy, like biting into a thick cracker. Meh.

				I bought two slices the other night- pretty terrible.&nbsp; The sausage was balled like a frozen pizza from the freezer aisle (and tasted like it), the crust was bready with no chew.&nbsp; But, the staff was very nice.

				Hate to say it but horrible.&nbsp; I went here instead of Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; I won&#039;t make that mistake again. <br /><br />Mario&#039;s did a nice job on the decor but they should focus instead on their product.&nbsp;

				I was in the area late this morning (11:45) and ordered a regular slice at Mario&#039;s (Louie&#039;s was closed).&nbsp; I noticed that the counterperson reached under the counter quickly and placed a slice in the oven.&nbsp; It was over cooked and dry and I&#039;m certain it was from the day before.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had Mario&#039;s before but later in the day so I know the difference.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not that bad if it&#039;s fresh made.&nbsp; Absolutely no excuse to serve day old pizza.&nbsp; Shame on you.&nbsp;
