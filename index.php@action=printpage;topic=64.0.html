				I&#039;ve been living in the neighborhood for a little over 30 years now, and have witnessed many interesting changes in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Just along the strip of 37th Avenue, along the 70s, there&#039;s been so much turnover in businesses and at the same time, we&#039;ve also had a few that have held their ground.&nbsp; Here are a few for those that may be curious:<br /><br />Courtesy Drug Store then a Rockbottom Pharmacy where the now Commerce Bank is located at 74th Street<br /><br />Key Food Supermarket where the now Duane Reade is located at 73rd Street<br /><br />Pizza Boy pizzeria -- seems like they&#039;ve been there for quite a while...at least since the mid-1970s<br /><br />Large liquor store on the southwest corner of 37th and 75th Street<br /><br />Decent fish market next door to Dunkin Donuts on 37th Ave<br /><br />Lousy fish market on the northeast corner of 78th Street and 37th Ave<br /><br />Used bookstore (very quaint) -- on 37th Ave., somewhere between 77th and 78th Street approx.<br /><br />Fur coat storage and cleaning service, next door to bookstore mentioned above<br /><br />Brandon&#039;s trinket shop on 37th near Baskin Robbins - also very quaint.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trade Fair was another supermarket in those days.&nbsp; It seemed to cater more to the neighborhood elderly and always seemed to be poorly stocked.<br /><br />Met was also a supermarket (Shop Wise).&nbsp; If you think it&#039;s bad now, you should have seen it back then.<br /><br />Social Security Office maintained a branch on Roosevelt Avenue where the large 99 cent store is now located<br /><br />Mom and Pop butcher shop on 74th Street before Roosevelt Avenue<br /><br />Lamston&#039;s shop (similar to Woolworth&#039;s) on 74th Street<br /><br />Another Key Food supermarket on 74th Street<br /><br />Stationery and school supplies store on 74th Street<br /><br />Mature woman&#039;s garment shop on 74th Street<br /><br />Photo developing shop on 74th Street<br /><br />Hardware/Houseware shop on 74th Street<br /><br />2 Floor Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd Street<br /><br />WOW!&nbsp; I think 74th Street has seen the biggest change.&nbsp; Anyone out there want to add some more?&nbsp; It would be interesting to know what existed even earlier.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I saw a Pizza Boy delivery car the other night. I was wondering it if was the same one. <br /><br />Don&#039;t forget the Lamston&#039;s that use to be on 74th Street and the Colony Theater on 82nd street (I used to work there as an usher was &quot;Stop or My Mom Will Shoot&quot; too many times to remember).

				Oops saw you mentioned Lamstons.&nbsp; There used to be the Discount Books where the Realty store is on 77th Street and the old antique/thrift ship&nbsp; &nbsp;that used to be next to the newspaper store on 75th street.

				I&#039;m born and raised in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I went to PS 69 and IS 145 when they were literally half the size they are now. <br /><br />Across the St. from PS 69 there used to be a Sizzler where the Jewish Community Center now stands. <br /><br />The liquor store mentioned above was actually on 73rd st. It was Sam&#039;s Liquor Store, Sam always&nbsp; gave me pennies when I went in there with my father. <br /><br />On the corner of 73rd St. and 37th road where Kabbab King is now, there used to be a place called Dumbarton Oaks, it was a stripper bar but prior to that it was actually a respectable restaurant (or so I&#039;ve been told).<br /><br />On the same block just past the Eagle (or Earle) theater there was a pizza shop, Benny and Tony were the father son team that ran the place. Sal&#039;s barber shop (now on 76th st.) was also there. Sal still cuts my hair some times. A tiny little deli that never seemed to do any business, and The Magic Touch an old style gay bar. Across the st. there was a type writer repair show. which lasted for the longest time and I believe was replaced by a travel agent. <br /><br />Going west on Broadway where the Korean Market is now, there used to be an A&amp;P.<br /><br />One more block west at 72nd and Broadway there was Gibbons, an Irish bar &amp; restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over to 37th ave. near 79th St. where Novo currently is was Barrs Toy store. Next to it where the Starbucks is allegedly going was a bridal shop.<br /><br />On the South side of 37th ave between 74th and 75th there was a Carvel Ice Cream store. <br /><br />The building that currently houses The Renaissance Charter School on 37th ave between 81st and 82nd used to be C&amp;S a horrible department store that no one ever went to.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a candy store on the South East corner of 82nd St. <br /><br />The Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd st. was indeed 2 floors and had a diner in it. <br /><br />On Northern Boulevard next to the Mark Twain Diner there used to be an Arby&#039;s.&nbsp; Where Rite Aid is now there was a C-Town. <br /><br />On 76th St. just behind a small car lot there used to be Northern Lanes. Our other bowling alley. <br /><br />Natives on 83rd and Northern used to be a movie theatre. <br /><br />That&#039;s all that comes to mind at the moment.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				I grew up in Woodside, but I&#039;ve been living in JH for the last 25 years. Here are a few places I miss:<br /><br />74 street, between 37th and Roosevelt ~ Jay Dee bakery<br />2 variety stores an 37th ave. Abe Hill (74/75 st.) and Marvel (83/84 st.)<br />Luigi&#039;s Restaurant ~ 37th ave, 84 st.<br />Tien Chau ~ Roosevelt around 76 st and #1 Chinese on 82 st. off Roosevelt.<br />&nbsp;I also remember the Colony movie theatre on 82 st. between 37th ave. and Roosevelt, as well as Clarks (dept. store).<br />Dragonseed restaurant on 37th ave. and 86 st.<br />What&#039;s now M + V cafe was Winston bagels, and the decent fish store mentioned above on 37th. and 76st. was called Scorpio.<br /><br />There was also a good German style deli on 37th. ave 73/72 street, a Greek butcher on 37th. around 78 st and another butcher on Roosevelt and 82/83 st.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s probably more, but I can&#039;t remember right now.<br /><br />

				Excellent guys!&nbsp; You&#039;ve brought back many memories of the places I failed to mention in my original post.&nbsp; The neighborhood sure has changed!&nbsp; By the way, I remember putting a blouse on lay-away (do retailers still do this?) at the Field&#039;s department store.&nbsp; I felt kind of obligated to do it because the saleslady was so pushy.&nbsp; She only asked for $1.00 to hold the $10 blouse for me.&nbsp; I lost the dollar because I never returned.&nbsp; :embarassed:

There used to be 4 bakeries in the local area that were the best in the City. Norgards, Avon, Steinway Bake Shop and Jay Dee.

One of my high school friends&#039; Dad used to be a baker at Jay Dee. He used to take such pride in his work. Too bad we can&#039;t go back, huh!

				I lived in and around Jackson Heights since 1979.&nbsp; Some of the place I miss are:<br /><br />Dragon Seed Restaurant on 86st/37ave - Great food and atmosphere and awesome tropical drinks.&nbsp; For those who remember it was not just a Chinese restaurant but a Polynesian one also.<br /><br />Continental Deli 82st/Roosevelt Ave / Graf&#039;s Deli 92st/37ave - good old fashioned delis with homemade salads<br /><br />Mike&#039;s Deli - 82st/37 ave - You could by a sandwich and sit at a table without waitress service<br /><br />Glendale Bake Shop - 82nd St just off 37th avenue - A good bakery with a good deli counter.&nbsp; Was burnt to the ground in a fire around 1989 that also burned dowen the Continental Restaurant<br /><br />Colony Movie Theater 82St between 37 Ave and Roosevelt Avenue and the Boulevard Theater on 82St and Northern Boulevard (There were three separate first run theaters in Jackson Heights at one time!).<br /><br />Joey D&#039;s Pizza on 82 Street just south of Roosevelt Avenue. <br /><br />These were just to name a few.&nbsp; I am going to post a separate thread on all the bars in Jackson Heights that are now gone. <br /><br />

				There was a roller skating rink on the north side of Roosevelt Ave. at around 70th street right next to the BQE.&nbsp; I think there is a church or a warehouse/distribution center in that space now.<br /><br />And there used to be a hospital on 34th Avenue between 73rd and 74th Street where the school is.&nbsp; Luckily I never ended up there after any of my roller disco adventures!<br /><br />

				I had the luck to go to the hospital on 73 st. and 34 ave,(Jackson Heights hospital/Wyckoff) twice! Once I had x rays in the basement and it was like being in a bad sci/fi movie from the fifties. <br /><br />I also remember eating at the Jackson Diner on 74st. near 37th ave. The menu was half American and half Indian. So, you could have an egg salad sandwich with a side of samosa&#039;s.<br />There was a German waitress who had a heavy accent, who once corrected the way I pronounced chole puri. That was pretty funny.

				<br /><br />The JayDee (sp?) Bakery I believed relocated to that mini-shopping outlet down on 76st and 31th ave ish.&nbsp; Who remembers Abe Hill where Frank&#039;s Pharmacy is located at the moment?&nbsp; Gustosa&#039;s Pizza used to be Romeo&#039;s (same owner).&nbsp; Peppino&#039;s went through a few alterations.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Also Leisure Videos on the corner of 81st and 37th ave.&nbsp; There were two other video stores...One near where Elmhurst Pizza is one 37th ave on the 76th to 75th street lot.&nbsp; It was called Lottso Videos I believe.&nbsp; Another one was near where Niba Discount, between 75th and 74th street on 37th ave is located.&nbsp; Hopefully, I am not repeating what has been mentioned. <br /><br />Before my time, my uncle told me where Duane Reade is now (long before even Key Food) the area was used as a venue for performances (like jazz music etc.).&nbsp; Hah, at one point, we had two Key Food super-markets like almost a half a block away from each other!

				Excellent! I&#039;ve forgotten lots of these places.---bred in Jackson Heights ---over 30 years total.<br />Let&#039;s see some that may have been missed.<br /><br /><strong>Green Theme Florist</strong> on the corner of 75th and 37th ..northside...very dubious place...all sorts of plants and &quot;herbage&quot; could be purchased there. I was too young..just rumours 8)<br /><br /><strong>Raja&#039;s </strong>candystore which was located where the city cafe is now..across the street from PS69. Old guy who was really grumpy and wore an old white smock would sell all the&nbsp; baseball card, fake bubblegum cigarettes, handballs, bazooka gum and milkshakes you ever wanted ...(may be that the furniture in City is part of the original Rajas...looks familiar).<br /><br /><strong>Ferns!! </strong>on 74th street!! good call on that one...BUT do you remember that beautiful black wooden saddled..and when I say saddle I mean I think it was a real saddle-- coin operated horse?<br /><br />Don&#039;s on the corner of 80th street and 37th avenue ...where the bodega is now.&nbsp; Candystore soda shop with video games at the rear!<br /><br /><strong>The Pit!</strong> the arcade in the lower levels of the 74th street station. Great stamp collectors shop across the hall and that sketchy bar right by the bus terminal on the 74th and Roosevelt.---had to pass the bar to get to the stairs leading to the arcade.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Discount Bookstore</strong><br />Tons of old comic books, and I remember when they first opened they had 1000&#039;s of promotional movie photo BW stills..25 cents each.<br /><br /><strong>Barrs </strong>across the street from the Post office...a toystore and gift shop. Had great boardgames in the back!<br /><br /><strong>Numbers Records and Tapes</strong> (and 8 tracks...dad bought Saturday Night Fever there)...used to be on the corner where Ingrids is now on 78th street.<br /><br />Of course the Colony...snuck into my first rated R movie there.&nbsp; Conan the Barbarian....starring Gov,. Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />There used to be a store joined to ShopWise on the 76th street side. I think it was a toy store of sorts but my memories about that place date me to about 3 years old so a little foggy.<br /><br />There was&nbsp; a great Chinese restaurant where that Atlantis 2000 club is now. It was Chino Latino..as they all spoke Spanish and my 1st Communion party was hosted in the rear social room!<br /><br />Speaking of social clubs...right there on 37th road and 77th street..a real sketchy social club that was eventually closed by the police..big raid and all.<br /><br />Concha D&#039;Oro was the name of the pizza place next to the&nbsp; Eagle ..and I swear they had the Best slice I have had to this day. I really miss that pizza. Was not very busy.<br /><br />Guilllietas Pizza was the name of the present Thomas&#039; on 77th. Slice for 5o cents sicilian 55.<br /><br />If I remember anything else....<br /><br /><br />HEY if anyone has any photographs of these shopfronts please let me know. I just posted something about Toy City which is cited somewhere here im sure. I&#039;m working on a little Jackson Heights memories project.<br /><br />

				I remember spending a lot of money at Numbers Records &amp; Tapes as a teen.&nbsp; In addition to records, etc., they also stocked a large variety of those black t-shirts that had silk-screened images of rock stars on them.&nbsp; That was our uniform back then....Lee jeans, t-shirts and sneakers.&nbsp; Come to think of it, things haven&#039;t changed much!&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />Fern&#039;s on 74th and Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd were the stores I frequented for school supplies.<br /><br />Green Theme Florist was across the street from Armondo&#039;s.&nbsp; They sold a nice variety of green house plants.<br /><br />Do you remember the Carollos&#039; of Carollo bakery?&nbsp; The bakery&#039;s original locale was larger than the current one, and the pastries were better as well.&nbsp; I steer clear from it these days as the quality is not the same as when the Carollo family were the owners.<br /><br />Remember the benches in front of the post office?

				i&#039;m just sticking my head in to say hi and confess that i, too, am a longtime jax heights resident.&nbsp; i have spent at least 25 of my 27 years here.&nbsp; i grew up in the greystones (80th st. bet. 37th and 35th aves) but once my mom sold our apartment and moved to manhattan, i moved out and back to the neighborhood.&nbsp; i&#039;m now living in the mid 70s.<br /><br />you guys have pretty much covered most of my nostalgic faves.&nbsp; what about an old party goods/gift shop on 37th ave bet. 80th and 79th st (the post office side)?&nbsp; i forget what it was called, but they sold balloons, decorative pens, little figurines, toys, stickers, etc?&nbsp; it got taken over sometime in the early-mid 90s and was never the same after.&nbsp; i loved spending my allowance in that store.&nbsp; also!&nbsp; there used to be a fancier gift shop on 37th ave. bet. 80th and 79th (though much closer to 80th) on the opposite side of the street.&nbsp; that store sold crystal, fancy plush stuffed animals, music boxes, etc.&nbsp; oh, if only i could remember their names.&nbsp; did anyone mention genovese on 82nd?&nbsp; i spent a good chunk of my allowance there experimenting with wet-n-wild makeup (janet--do you read this board?&nbsp; if so, chime in here!).&nbsp; do you guys remember when the burger king space (82nd st) used to be roy rogers?<br /><br />that&#039;s all i&#039;m remembering now. ahh, reminiscing.&nbsp; somewhat off-topic, but i just met another long time resident of jax heights at a new year&#039;s eve party by coincidence. small &#039;hood.&nbsp; perhaps we&#039;ve all seen each other around at some point. <br />

				I remember that small gift shop. I was friendly with the owner. She liked to get stuff that was hand-crafted. Prior to her closing, she was having a hard time selling. She did well around the holidays, and then nothing. She gave me one beautiful hand-crafted photo album for a wedding present. <br /><br />Does anyone remember woolworths? I think it&#039;s now Duane Reade. The other memory is Rockbottom on 74th st. Parade of shoes (which I loved). And whatever happened to Cafe Greco?

				The gift shop located on 37th between 79th and 80th was called Ancil House.&nbsp; The other store across the street that sold crystal, etc - I am pretty sure was called Tante Mieux (sp.) - and that was actually its second location - before that it was on 78th Street off 37th Avenue - where the 78 Nail salon is now.&nbsp;

				The store next to Seba Seba is called Inner Peace.&nbsp; They have some very nice things.&nbsp; One of the original owners who opened the store with his fiancee, Tanya, was named Sergio Villanueva.&nbsp; He was a fireman who was killed on September 11th.&nbsp; They were an extremely nice couple who were always very helpful.&nbsp;

				The mention of Seba Seba reminded me of the small coffee shop that was located at that corner prior to Seba.&nbsp; It was a pretty run down looking place, but business always seemed to be hopping, particularly at breakfast time.&nbsp; The tables were wobbly, the booths were taped up and the stools sometimes fell off.&nbsp; It was a family owned business, and on occasion, the owner&#039;s kids would help in the kitchen preparing dishes or cleaning-up.&nbsp; They had a waitress named Maria, who was like a machine.&nbsp; She&#039;d take orders, cook, clean, work the register, etc.&nbsp; The prices were dirt cheap.&nbsp; Maybe that explains why the place always seemed crowded.&nbsp; The coffee shop didn&#039;t occupy the entire space that Seba Seba has now though.&nbsp; Seba expanded once the Makeup Shop salon moved to their present location at 78th Street.<br /><br />The space currently occupied by the Makeup Shop salon was previously an old fashioned shoe cobbler shop.&nbsp; The space was huge.&nbsp; I believe that business was moved to a smaller spot northeast on 37th Avenue, somewhere in the mid 80s.&nbsp; There was talk of his retirement recently, so I&#039;m not sure if he&#039;s still repairing shoes today.<br /><br />Does anyone remember 18 de Julio?&nbsp; This was an Argentinean grill spot that was located in the space currently occupied by La Boina Roja (the one in the 70s).&nbsp; That place had a huge grill by the front window and was always jam packed.&nbsp; They also had a large screen tv broadcasting futbol games.&nbsp; Fans would gather in the restaurant as well as outside to catch a glimpse of the action.&nbsp; I was surprised to see it close, especially since they seemed to do good business there.

				The old coffee shop was technically named &quot;Christy&#039;s&quot; but the owner&#039;s name was Tony.&nbsp; Maria was great!&nbsp; And Tony made a great breakfast..

				I&#039;ve been here forever. The Seba Seba location was George&#039;s at one time, but when I was a kid it was Edson&#039;s and Bud Edson was the cook/owner. The butcher between 81st &amp; 80th on the north side of 37th was Sullivan&#039;s. <br /><br />The North Fork/Jamaica Savings/soon to be Capitol One was a Rexall drug store. <br /><br />There was a boutique called Marie Sheridan&#039;s where Bang Bang was. Super fancy ladies stuff.<br /><br />There&#039;s always been a stationery store btwn 82 &amp; 81st Sts. It was Weiss&#039;s, then Weiss Brothers. then Wise (with an Owl logo). The stores between there and Jahn&#039;s were an electronics store - Murray&#039;s? (Owner was Murray) and a liquor store - Battapaglia&#039;s. Rumor was that Danny Battapaglia was a bookie. Wouldn&#039;t know, that was grown up stuff.<br /><br />That is my selective memory from the past 55+ years.<br /><br />So nice to read the other memories.

Remember Shoe Shack on 82nd St?&nbsp; Remember the bank on the corner of 82nd &amp; 37th (I think it is still a bank) anyway, remember the Clock, it actually told the right time??<br /><br />Now do you remember on Roosevelt and 79th St., there was a Steak house/bar and Restaurant?&nbsp; Then on 79th Street toward 80th there was a furniture store and on the other side of the street, was a rug warehouse opposite Toy City.&nbsp; Then on 80th St in Roosevelt where the 99Cent store is today was, Social Security.&nbsp; The Make-up store was next to Toy City.&nbsp; (Remember I was a kid so, I was always was in Toy City getting toys) <br /><br />Does anyone remember the little antique shop next to Green Theme on 37th and 75th Street?&nbsp; It was owned by a Mother and her son?&nbsp; The son was kind of creepy looking to me but, he actually was nice.&nbsp; They sold doll house stuff?<br /><br />Thank you everyone for taking me back to a place, I truely miss!!!&nbsp; Wow I have been here a long long time.<br /><br />

				I am not a long-time Jackson Heights resident, but, before we moved in, I visited regularly since my grandmother lived in the neighborhood--and she was a very long time resident: 50+ years, if I remember correctly. I went for a brief time to Hebrew School at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, when it was on 82nd Street, and I got my first job there, working for Max Weber&#039;s catering business. And I remember when the Bollywood movie theater on 37th Road was a porn theater, and there was a gay bar on that same block called the Betsy Ross, if I remember correctly. And where there is now a very fancy hair salon near the corner of 80th Street and Northern Boulevard was a Lee&#039;s jeans store, where we used to buy a lot of our clothes.

Gone now of course. <br /><br />Somewhere in the neighborhood and I forget its original location was the Tant Meiux, sold fancy house wares and decorative things long before Rudy Volcano was the place for that.

				I too remember eating at the lunch counter at Woolworth&#039;s. I loved their greasy fries served by ladies wearing typical 1950s waitress uniforms. <br /><br />I also loved Ancil House (sp?) but swear it was called something after that and still sold the same kindof off beat items. I loved that place as a kid.<br /><br />I also remember a photo development place near Roosevelt on 82 that sold Hello Kitty items in the back. It was a treat to be taken there to buy a pen or some Twin Star notebook.<br /><br />I also remember where the parking garage is now, a bakery and a Hallmark ... then a fire destroyed those stores. <br /><br />Before the Burger King and before the Roy Rogers, I&#039;m pretty sure there was a men&#039;s clothing store there.

				There was a Florsheim at that location.&nbsp; I remember when I was in my early 20&#039;s their shoes seemed so expensive to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think inflation on the price of shoes has been as high as inflation in general.

				Eddie, in my opinion, men&#039;s shoes always seemed more expensive to me than women&#039;s shoes.&nbsp; I remember buying shoes at a store on 82nd Street called Baker&#039;s.&nbsp; In my early 20s, I could purchase a pair of fashionable shoes for about $20 to $25.&nbsp; O.K., so probably not the best quality at the time, but cute shoes nonetheless.&nbsp; I remember the prices for men&#039;s shoes at Florsheim&#039;s.&nbsp; They were a lot more than $20!

				Thanks Chuck.<br /><br />You guys remember a small shoe store on the same side as Genovese but closer to 37th avenue?&nbsp; During the 70&#039;s in the window display, they had a man&#039;s platform shoe with a siamese fighting fish inside the heel.<br /><br />Also in the 70&#039;s, I worked in Fields on the corner of 82nd street.&nbsp; I worked in the men&#039;s department with a few old timers at that time.&nbsp; HMMM...I feel like I&#039;m close to the age that the old timers were!&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL!!!

				Birch-Ed, seeing that you were an employee of Fields back in the day, would you care to share some of your sales tactics?&nbsp; I remember that store being heavy on the sales push, and I imagine that all sales people were trained to aggressively target customers.&nbsp; There were many times when I opted out of entering the store for that reason alone.&nbsp; On an earlier post in this thread, I wrote that I once fell victim to the hard sell and placed an item on the store&#039;s lay-away plan.&nbsp; I left a small deposit, which I ended up losing because I never returned.<br /><br />I know, I know....I was probably their classic target customer.&nbsp; &nbsp;:embarassed:

				Chuckster...thanks for the picture.&nbsp; I see that in the beginning Fields was only part of the block.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure when the expanded to all of 37th avenue between 81 and 82 street.&nbsp; I had heard that Fields was very popular with a few famous people and they used to attend the fashion shows held there in the 60&#039;s.<br /><br />As for the sale tactics.&nbsp; Yes...the salesmen were very aggressive.&nbsp; They&nbsp; attacked you like a rabid dog tearing at a piece of raw meat.&nbsp; I was the young salesman.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t do what they did, I had my own way of doing things.&nbsp; One time the head salesman, I think his name was Sid, told me I wasn&#039;t aggressive enough.&nbsp; I asked him if he was disappointed at my sales record and he responded no.&nbsp; So I told him that I must be doing something right, so he left me alone.

				I remember the last days of the Northern Triplex. Art Deco faded glory, balcony,beautiful railings, 1920&#039;s moorish light fixtures, most of it painted a horrible high gloss blue. Did anyone ever go into the Polk? That was a tragic loss. There was a traditional Cantonese place called &quot;Magic Lamp&quot; on <br />Roosevelt and 76th . They had the roast pork, soy chicken, duck and ribs hanging up and did a killer congee with crueller. The place was filthy but it was good for takeout. Los Pollos Brasos on 37th was a carpet store with an art deco entrance that might still be there. On Broadway next to Pacific there was an irish bar called &quot;Liffey Bar&quot;. It had a cobalt blue mirrored bar and lots of carved dark wood. Let us not forget the Jackson Heights Jewish Center on 82nd where PS212 now stands.The original Jackson Diner was an old diner that made homemade chicken salad(chopped while you waited) and served it with a dish of chole. They had a section of Indian food on the classic plastic coated diner menu. There was a fur storage place next to Trade Fair that had a danish modern desk that many of us lusted after.

				Used to be <strong>The Hobby Hut</strong> on 83rd Street, off 37th Ave, sold model ships and trains. <br /><br />Before the Jewish Center moved 77th Street (next to Shop-Wise) was a Sizzler and before that a KFC. <br /><br />The Fruit market on 78th Street &amp; 37th was owned by Sal and his checkout help Stella used to baby-sit me and my sister on weekends.<br /><br />Murray&#039;s Jewish Deli was the first hot-dog I remember, made their own Katsup (which I didn&#039;t like) There was a Jewish butcher across the street (next to Big Deal , now the Trade-Fair)<br /><br /><strong>Washington Discount</strong> on 37th just off 78th could fix any watch or get any type of battery you needed. Also sold discount shampoo/cosmetics before the CVS&#039;s and Walgreen&#039;s of this world.<br /><br /><strong>Northern Lanes</strong> on 75th Street of Northern, (bowling lanes were bumpy) Now part of the car dealer.<br /><br />There were industries on the west side of the Heights near the Connecting Railroad. Place that did plating, a surgical instrument maker and a printer. White Castle District Office still remains.<br /><br />You could actually play with ALL your schoolmates in PS69&#039;s and IS 145&#039;s school yards<br /><br />Cafe 77 was a real Chinese Laundry, took many of my Grandfathers shirts there (and each regular customer had a mark)<br /><br />The <strong>Jackson Heights Library</strong> actually had BOOKS in it. Rows and rows of books. Didn&#039;t have to wait for inter-branch loans to come in.<br /><br />Brown&#039;s Army and Navy Stores still survive!<br /><br />Grandmother used to make the trek to <strong>Pick-n-Pack</strong> down on 37th and 85th(?) for discount meat and then complain about all the red food dye they used. <br /><br />The Big Delicatessen on Roosevelt between 82nd and 83rd, (German Potato Salad).<br /><br />The movie theater on Northern had big holes in the roof but would let you in to see the &quot;R&quot; rated movies.<br /><br /><strong>The Roman Cave </strong>was the place to go for Italian Food and treated little kids like kings!<br /><br /><strong>The Old Barn</strong> on Roosevelt and 80th(/) served family sized meals. You could buy your furniture at <strong>Jackson Furniture</strong> across the street.<br /><br />The <strong>Garden School</strong> had guard dogs in their yard. They were the type that would let you in, but then you could not leave. (Great &quot;kid&quot; fun petting the guard dog then having your buddy distract the dog so you could get your hand out of the fence holes) The car dealers had dogs too.<br /><br />You can now add the Q19B to the list of things &quot;gone&quot; at least in name.<br /><br />There was no 115 Pct. You had to deal with the 114 Pct. or 110 Pct. and wait FOREVER for a patrol car. Heaven help the person who had an auto accident on Northern. They might still be waiting&nbsp; ;D

				Bakery on Roosevelt was Shelly&#039;s and do you remember Myers or Meyer&#039;s coffee shop near the corner of 82nd and Roosevelt?<br /><br />The Boulevard theater&#039;s doors on 83rd st had a gap and you could watch pictures through the slit.

				I grew up in Jackson Heights... went to ps 145 and Newtown HS...<br /><br />There was a Wolkes ( don&#039;t remember the spelling) on 85th and 37th avenue right near a linoleum store that was owned by a guy who had the worst smelling cigar and stood outside his store constantly.<br /><br />There was a restaurant called&nbsp; Green Kitchen... they had green booths, i think.<br /><br />There was also a Horn and Hardart store on 82nd between 37th and Roosevelt.<br /><br />The big department stores were Fields and Clarks.<br /><br />Rauchs was a high end childrens clothing store.<br /><br />When I was growing up, there was no need to go into &quot;the city&quot; as we called it... we had everything we needed just a few steps away from where we lived.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a wonderful way to grow up.

				I discovered this site in the way you find lots of things on the internet as you get pin balled around looking for things. I was actually looking up the history of the old Physicians Hospital where my brother was born and found this site and the discussion of the &quot;old Jackson Heights&quot;. I put that in quotes because a lot of the references seem not so old to a semi old guy like me. <br />Anyway I loved living in Jackson Heights and intend to move back in the next two years after 35 years in London. So what do I remember about growing up in the 50&#039;s. Stickball in the streets(touch football too) and playing in the&nbsp; PS69 schoolyard.Walking along 37th Ave was it the A&amp;P between 73rd and 74th where they ground coffee up at the counter. Dr. Price the dentist on 73rd.opposite the Blue Haven nightclub(smoked windows made it always seem dangerous)The Hamburger Express where the hamburger came on electric trains.the tiny specialty candy store on 75th St and 37th that was run by Arthur Landau&#039;s parents.Wechsler&#039;s on 75th St and 37th where the door opened to the glorious smell of smoked fish, apricot leather, pickles and cheese. The classic &quot;appetiser store&quot; The old public library that predated the 81st St. library. It had the story lady every Sat. morning and was located where the supermarket is now between 76th and 77th. and it was where I learned about books. Funny that there is a little reminder of it with the second hand book man nearly on its old site.<br /><br />Of course the Toddle House which was a little place on the corner of 77th&nbsp; leading to Moe &#039;n&#039; Archies candy store(now a Korean grocery) where stick ballers would get Mission&nbsp; grape or cream soda or Italian ice. It had a long counter where if you were feeling flush you could get a malted made in chrome cylinder&#039;s plugged into a whizzer.The Post Office-thankfully the same as always with its NRA mural. Fields where I got my boy scout uniform. Smoked my first cigarette in the Colony balcony watching a Tyrone Power film about a ship wreck. That combination nearly put me off smoking but I persevered and was confirmed at Pulitzer Jr. High and even more at Bryant H.S. Moving along 82nd to the Jackson there was a little deli that sold 15 cent hot dogs before you saw the double bill. Of course my favorite was the Earle theatre with a classic art&nbsp; deco aquarium interior.(gone gone gone) Saw Sat morning serials there and followed it as I got older when it played foreign films. It did become a grind house showing porn films after I left with a small link to its community past with a sign that said &quot;discounts for senior citizens.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway I could go on. I feel privileged to have lived in Jackson Heights in its glory days. A wonderful place that happily despite all the demographic changes retains something of the old spirit.

				E Train, loved your memories&nbsp; :) and how funny we followed the same path (very likely a few years apart) from Pulitzer to Bryant :) though my brief smoking career started while visitng cousins in Ireland and ended well before I graduated Bryant :) <br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m sure we mentioned it here already but Physicians Hospital briefly became Wycoff Heights Hospital (not sure why) and was then torn down and replaced with MS 230. <br /><br />My recollection of the A&amp;P was between 73rd and 72nd St. along Broadway where there is now a Korean Market and some small Korean bars etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I GREW UP IN J HTS, BUT MOVED OUT TO SUNNY FLORIDA IN 1988.<br /><br />I HAVE ENJOYED READING ALL ABOUT MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD A FOND MEMORY OF<br /><br />HAMBURGER EXPRESS, WHICH WAS BETWEEN 77TH AND 76TH STREET ON 37 AVE. IT WAS A FRIDAY TREAT<br /><br />TO GO THERE FOR LUNCH, THE TRAIN WOULD BRING YOU A HAMBURGER RIGHT TO YOUR SEAT.

				I grew up in Jackson Heights, am in my early 50&#039;s.&nbsp; Up through the mid 1970&#039;s:&nbsp; I remember across from PS 69, hamburger express, the Jewish Deli, toy store, Shopwise.&nbsp; Then Baskin and Robbins.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then a few blocks away:&nbsp; Jahn&#039;s ice cream parlor, Fields Dept. store&nbsp; (where I worked over Xmas time when I was 16 and 17) I remember the record store by the upstairs train on 82nd street.&nbsp; The daughter of Barr&#039;s gifts was in class with me. I remember Eldon&#039;s clothing store, named after the owner&#039;s kids that I also knew.&nbsp; Clarks clothings store. There were alot of shoe stores, chock full of nuts cafe on the corner by train.&nbsp; Woolworths. Genevese drug store. 3 movie theaters :&nbsp; Polk, Earle? and the one on northern blvd and 83rd, where 145 had graduation ceremony each June.&nbsp; There were great pizza places all over the place.&nbsp; A few good chinese restaurants/take out.<br /><br />The Jewish Center was very active&nbsp; a few blocks away from where I lived, (on 84th and 35th ave. )&nbsp; I also attended IS 145 as well as the Garden School accross the street.&nbsp; Both sets of my grandparents lived in the neighborhood:&nbsp; Donnelly Gardens in the 70&#039;s and on 74th and 35th ave.&nbsp; I remember hanging out all the time as a kid at the playground on 78th between 34th and northern blvd.&nbsp; Memories also of a few summers spent at the Jackson Heights Country Club, which had a nice pool and playing paddle ball....The neighborhood has seen so many changes over the past 30 years!

				You sure brought back a lot of great memories.&nbsp; I lived in Jackson Heights until 1976 and then visited frequently while my mother was there until 2003.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning to visit this weekend and will probably be shocked by all the changes.<br /><br />I do remember the Chinese Laundry where I think Espresso 77 is now.&nbsp; There was also a small pizza shop near the laundry where we used to get pizza for 15 cents a slice when I went to PS 69.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember Rajah&#039;s when the candy was 5 cents and bubble gum was 1 cent. I was friends with the owners daughter.&nbsp; We went to the Hamburger Express and the deli for lunch too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also remember the Carvel on 37th near 75 St.&nbsp; I saw my first movie at the Colony.&nbsp; I remember getting shoes at the Stride Right on 82nd, Clarks, Fields, Barrs, Bakers and Miles shoe stores, Genovese, Chock Full O Nuts, Shelley&#039;s Bakery, graduating from 145 at the Boulevard Theater, Shop Wise, Newman Jewelers where I used to get presents for my parents, Harvey&#039;s mens shop, Woolworths, Lamstons, Ferns, Weiss stationers, Toy City on 37th between 75 and 76 (the line was out the door on the first day of school).&nbsp;

				Wow &quot;1963&quot; Sam + Raj now that brings back memories as does Dairy Queen which was actually a Dairy Queen Brazier (one that serves hamburgers etc.). And Jack in the Box with that creepy drive thru clown head. I used to ride my 3 speed there with my friends and we&#039;d use the drive thru with our bikes. It was the first place I ever had a taco at and loved those Jumbo Jacks. <br /><br />Victor Moore Arcade that was a block away from where I lived. There used to be a cookie place in there too I remember them having the best butterscotch cookies in the world. Wasn&#039;t the stamp store across from the video game arcade? Man I wish I could see pictures of that arcade area and the rest of Jackson Heights 60&#039;s, 70&#039;s and early 80&#039;s. Amazing how little of it exists online. Looking at my own family photos you basically see inside of the house and the backyard or pictures of other peoples apartments. I wish I would have snapped all of the places mentioned with my 110 and disc cameras!

				Here&#039;s one that has been bugging me for a long time..<br /><br />Does any long time resident remember the shop that was &quot;connected&quot; to the right side of the now MET supermarket?<br /><br />When it used to be Shop Wise ... there was a shop (facing the front of the supermarket) taking up the right side corner about a 1/5? of the length of the now Met food. Shop Wise bought it out...maybe in &#039;75 and expanded? I remember it being something like a stationary store&gt;? Had a Big Wheel in the window one time I recall...<br /><br />...what was that place?? ???<br /><br />-Sabro

Bickford&#039;s!&nbsp; That was inside the terminal at 74th and Roosevelt.&nbsp; That was where my father took me for hamburgers.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was another pool hall on the corner of 82nd and Roosevelt, by the train station there.&nbsp; Across 82nd Street was Chock Full &#039;O Nuts, on the corner (not part of the original arrangement of the early 60s), then, around the corner, Meyers ice cream parlor, then the Continental deli (a good German deli on every block, in those days!) then Shelley&#039;s bakery (the best bakery in town) and the butcher shop, and then something else that I can&#039;t recall; maybe a jewelery store.&nbsp; <br /><br />Across Roosevelt was the bank, on the corner, then the notions shop, then, I think, the Army/Navy store - - and then maybe a toy store (or perhaps that was on the next block).&nbsp; <br /><br />Around the corner from the bank was the Colony Delicatessen, a florist&#039;s,maybe a pizza shop at one time, a little records/instrument shop, the Jackson movie theater, and a little fruit store and butcher shop on that corner.&nbsp; Around the corner was, eventually, a little book shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was that little triangle, with benches and a few old trees, where people would sit and feed the pigeons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coming down 82nd Street, toward Roosevelt, on the opposite side of the street, was a small apartment building that was put up in the mid-60s, on the corner of 82nd and Baxter, the candy store, belonging to the Sbarrs, a little Spanish record shop, a tiny grocery store, then the small vacuum cleaner store, then a couple of little old buildings with professional offices in them, then a beauty salon called Si Jolie, I might be missing something here, then the Associated food store, something else that I don&#039;t recall, Joey D&#039;s Pizzeria, a Hallmark store, a doughnut shop, a little luncheonette, a creepy little building that once had a fortune teller in it (there was a bus stop in front of the luncheonette), Disco Roosevelt Drugs, on the corner, a florist around the corner from it, a couple of other things that escape me at the moment, and on the next block, the Lido Italian resturant and the New Cathay Chinese resturant (Cantonese and Mandarin).&nbsp; There was, I recall, a picture framing shop on that block.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the corner of 80th and Roosevelt was the vet, Klausman&#039;s.&nbsp; A funeral home across the avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />On 81st and Roosevelt was that steak house that someone mentioned, that was a meeting place for sharply-dressed mafiosos in the builders association, where they would have lunch, and another great German deli; there used to be a candy store on that corner, way back, before they put in that steak house.&nbsp; Then another bank.&nbsp; <br /><br />A candy store on the corner, opposite Disco Drugs, and the pool hall over that candy store.&nbsp; They put in a Puppy Palace for a while, I remember, next to it, I think.&nbsp; Opposite, next to the Chock Full &#039;O Nuts was a jewelry store, a Merit Farms, Joyce Leslie and another women&#039;s store, either after or before a teeny little pizza place, downstairs from which was the bowling alley, then another store that sold cut flowers, I think - - all very narrow shops, there, and the Woolworth&#039;s, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />On Broadway, off 82nd Street, which became Baxter Avenue, was a big German resturant, with lots of little mounted antlers all over the place, called the Hoffbrau.&nbsp; A car wash across Broadway.&nbsp; The Elmwood Diner on the other side of the street, beside the playground across from the hospital.&nbsp; <br /><br />And every Christmas-time they&#039;d put up garlands and lights all down 82nd Street, and on 37th Avenue, and at night, to a little child, it looked lovely and special.&nbsp;

				I&#039;d like to agree with Chuckster.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newcomer; I moved here six years ago from California when my wife and I were expecting our first child.&nbsp; We chose JH because it was diverse, vibrant, child-friendly, and affordable (we chose well -- we have no regrets, and are planning to stay here for the long term!).&nbsp; Other neighborhoods comparable in price like Forest Hills and various neighborhoods in Brooklyn were less interesting to us because they lacked the diversity that JH had to offer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard similar stories from many of the other newcomers I&#039;ve encountered.<br /><br />And you might be surprised by a visit to 74th Street!&nbsp; Erase from your mind any image of a ghetto of poor immigrants.&nbsp; This is the top South Asian shopping district in the U.S. -- store after store of fine jewelery and expensive saris, catering to Indian brides from all over the U.S. stopping in N.Y. to shop before returning home to India for their weddings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Neighborhoods in NYC need constant change, or they become stale.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has seen many waves of immigrants... over the years, these have included many different ethnic groups.&nbsp; Our latest wave is an influx of Mexicans, Tibetans and Nepalis.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians, Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Koreans before them, they&#039;re adding to our neighborhood&#039;s tapestry, and many of us welcome them.

I&#039;m a newcomer; I moved here six years ago from California when my wife and I were expecting our first child.&nbsp; We chose JH because it was diverse, vibrant, child-friendly, and affordable (we chose well -- we have no regrets, and are planning to stay here for the long term!).&nbsp; Other neighborhoods comparable in price like Forest Hills and various neighborhoods in Brooklyn were less interesting to us because they lacked the diversity that JH had to offer.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard similar stories from many of the other newcomers I&#039;ve encountered.<br /><br />And you might be surprised by a visit to 74th Street!&nbsp; Erase from your mind any image of a ghetto of poor immigrants.&nbsp; This is the top South Asian shopping district in the U.S. -- store after store of fine jewelery and expensive saris, catering to Indian brides from all over the U.S. stopping in N.Y. to shop before returning home to India for their weddings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Neighborhoods in NYC need constant change, or they become stale.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has seen many waves of immigrants... over the years, these have included many different ethnic groups.&nbsp; Our latest wave is an influx of Mexicans, Tibetans and Nepalis.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the Jews, Russians, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians, Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Koreans before them, they&#039;re adding to our neighborhood&#039;s tapestry, and many of us welcome them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Hi, ToddG,<br /><br />In the early 1980s, I lived in the building in which I grew up, for a year, in a neighborhood that had become innundated with an Asian population, that clearly despised non-Asian culture and people.&nbsp; I lived there for a *year*, and for a year, I greeted my neighbors, every day, with a smile, and an appropriate greeting.&nbsp; When I left, after a *year*, I was still smiling and saying &quot;hello&quot;,and still *no one was returning the greeting*!&nbsp; Those people looked through me as if I weren&#039;t even there.&nbsp; They behaved as if I were an unwelcome intruder in *their* neighborhood.&nbsp; It was *not* &quot;coming home&quot;, as I had expected it to be.<br />As we are expressing personal opinions, and memories and impressions of the neighborhood in which we all grew up, I take the liberty of saying that it is disheartening for me to hear the only place I ever considered &quot;home&quot; being described as the &quot;top south Asian shopping district in the U.S.&quot;!&nbsp; And that, as such, your comment only magnifies the impression I get that Jackson Heights only remains in name - - and that the entire purpose and flavor of that neighborhood has been entirely destroyed.&nbsp; No longer is it a world away from the city; a safe, peaceful haven, away from the madding crowd.<br />Might I also point out to you that there is no such thing as &quot;*fine* Indian Jewelry&quot;, and that rows and rows of saree shops don&#039;t exactly transform J.H. into Beverly Hills.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t please me that Indian brides from all over the U.S. crowd into Jackson Heights and clog the neighborhood with that kind of traffic.&nbsp; What you are describing is *commercial*, and does not belong in a neighborhood, where people raise their families.&nbsp; The congestion of Manhattan is not what former residents of that neighborhood were aiming for.&nbsp; I have looked at the traffic reports for J.H., and seen that there was, a few years ago, an attempt to change a certain traffic routing, that was deemed to be *too much* for that neighborhood to accomodate.&nbsp; That was a very good indication of how much things have changed there.&nbsp; <br />The country has changed, and neighborhoods have changed with it - - for the worse!&nbsp; Oh, wouldn&#039;t you have loved to have been able to leave your back door unlocked, as we did, so that your children could run in and out, as they played, unguarded and without threat, in that neighborhood?&nbsp; Once - - it was heaven.&nbsp; I cannot help but mourn the loss of that.&nbsp; <br />One error that you make is in your combinations of immigrants, that you cite.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t as you say, you see.&nbsp; The Irish, Germans, Greeks, Italians, and Jews, who lived in J.H., all lived there at the same time.&nbsp; This was *European* culture - - and it was *compatible*.&nbsp; There *were* NO Puerto Ricans in Jackson Heights - - this was part of Manhattan&#039;s culture; not ours.&nbsp; &#039;West Side Story&#039; wasn&#039;t happening in our neighborhood - - unless it was playing at the Jackson.&nbsp; And Hispanic immigrants who came were from Cuba, Spain, and Columbia, and were entirely embracing of European culture; they were not distaff to the existing culture.&nbsp; And the neighborhood did not change to accomodate them.&nbsp; As you can see, from the descriptions of the stores and shops of yesteryear, Jackson Heights had its own culture, and when you came to live there, you became part of that neighborhood - - it didn&#039;t change to accomodate you.<br />I now live in a neighborhood where you have to have a car, and drive for miles, on shopping *expeditions*, to be able to access food and products you might want - - unless you are black, Hispanic or south Asian.&nbsp; Is that a *comfortable* neighborhood for me to live in?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (And *where* is the comfortable, convenient neighborhood for me to live in, that I can afford???)&nbsp; Again I will repeat, that were I to visit India, and discover that an entire neighborhood had been taken over by former residents of Jackson Heights, and made to entirely resemble that neighborhood, I would say - - &quot;What a shame!&quot;.<br />P.S.&nbsp; Nothing &quot;stale&quot; about a place that is reliably the sort of neighborhood that I knew J.H. to be!</em>

Great stamp collectors shop across the hall and that sketchy bar right by the bus terminal on the 74th and Roosevelt.---had to pass the bar to get to the stairs leading to the arcade.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Discount Bookstore</strong><br />Tons of old comic books, and I remember when they first opened they had 1000&#039;s of promotional movie photo BW stills..25 cents each.<br /><br /><strong>Barrs </strong>across the street from the Post office...a toystore and gift shop. Had great boardgames in the back!<br /><br /><strong>Numbers Records and Tapes</strong> (and 8 tracks...dad bought Saturday Night Fever there)...used to be on the corner where Ingrids is now on 78th street.<br /><br />Of course the Colony...snuck into my first rated R movie there.&nbsp; Conan the Barbarian....starring Gov,.

I think it was a toy store of sorts but my memories about that place date me to about 3 years old so a little foggy.<br /><br />There was&nbsp; a great Chinese restaurant where that Atlantis 2000 club is now.

I really miss that pizza. Was not very busy.<br /><br />Guilllietas Pizza was the name of the present Thomas&#039; on 77th. Slice for 5o cents sicilian 55.<br /><br />If I remember anything else....<br /><br /><br />HEY if anyone has any photographs of these shopfronts please let me know.

				I&#039;m a &quot;Heightster&quot; from way back - I lived in Jackson Heights from 1941 through 1985. My father was the Medical Laboratory director at Physician&#039;s Hospital, where I also worked in the late &#039;50s to put myself through college. I have fond memories of my primary school too, called the Garden Country Day School ( at least that&#039;s what it was called before I &#039;graduated&#039; in 1949). We had a pet monkey at the time, named Chipper, who had a part in my school play when I was in second grade. My favorite teacher was in sixth grade - Mrs Smith. And the principal was Mr Flowers, whose wife was his secretary. The part of Jackson Heights where I lived was on the far side of the Grand Central Parkway in a development called &quot;Garden Bay Manor&quot; - a development of garden apartments geared toward families. I attended PS 2 for kindergarten, before I transferred to Garden School. It&#039;s located on Ditmars Boulevard and 74th Street,&nbsp; and is where my two children also got a great public school education. It&#039;s now called the Alfred E Zimberg school, named after the magnificent principal from the &#039;70s. I also went to Sunday School at the Community Church on 34th Avenue,(I think) in Jackson Heights proper. Sometimes I played hookey from sunday school, and window-shopped in Field&#039;s windows on 82nd street. As a new &#039;poster&#039;, I love walking down memory lane through this site. I live a world away now, in Sydney, Australia, but my &#039;hometown&#039; will always be Jackson Heights!

				The butcher everyone is confused about, if youre talking real old school, wasnt on the corner. It was in the middle of the block on 37th between 75th and 76th. Run by an Armenian guy. Everyone knew him. Sawdust on the floor etc. And what about Lees on Northern.

				First time posting here...<br /><br />My family has been in Jackson Heights since the 1930&#039;s.&nbsp; My mom still lives on 82nd Street off Northern Boulevard.<br /><br />I was born in Physician&#039;s hospital on 34th Avenue in 1965 (my brother in 1960).&nbsp; At the time, my family lived in Long Island.&nbsp; We moved back in 1976.<br /><br />I graduated from Pulitzer in 1979 when the dragon mural was on the mini-school and from Newtown in 1983 (never went to the Annex (old bowling alley)...went to Art &amp; Design for 1 year before transferring.<br /><br />There used to be a bank on the corner of 82nd &amp; Northern where &quot;Going in Style&quot; with Art Carney &amp; George Burns was filmed.&nbsp; I remember Art opening the curtains of his trailer to say hi to everyone...it was parked right in front of my mom&#039;s building.<br /><br />My grandfather was a doctor in the neighborhood.<br /><br />My family owned Lee&#039;s on Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; It started as one store by my great uncle and then grew to take over the 3 stores it had.&nbsp; Does anyone remember the ice cream place that used to be next door (that eventually became part of Lee&#039;s?).&nbsp; <br /><br />Lots of memories here.&nbsp; I remember going to Nescott with my girlfriend to buy make up.&nbsp; Also, I remember going to Something Else with my mom wondering when I would ever fit in those clothes...beautiful stuff they had.&nbsp; I remember buying matching satin jackets with my girlfriend from a place close to the train station on 82nd Street (next to Carvel) but can&#039;t remember the name right now.&nbsp; I remember seeing going to see Silver Streak, Saturday Night Fever, etc. in the movie theater on Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; Firehouse on Northern always brings back memories, since I&#039;m currently married to a firefighter and living out in NJ.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the trip down memory lane!!!

				<br />Just discovered this forum and truly enjoyed this thread. I was born at Physicians Hospital in &#039;49. My sister (&#039;55) and my brother (&#039;59) were also born there. Our family doctor was Dr. Berger, who made house calls, and who shared an office with Dr. Bellin (sp?) on 80th or 81st between Roosevelt and 37th. I attended PS 149 and saw my first movie, BAMBI, at the Polk. I&#039;m pretty sure the second film I saw there was a Saturday matinee of FUNNY FACE with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />I remember well the lunch counter at Woolworth&#039;s, Horn and Hardart&#039;s and the Hamburger Express with those incredible trains serving up the burgers. My mother shopped at Fields with a vengeance. I read my first book from cover to cover at the JH library.<br /><br />Does anyone remember the name of the pet shop/aquarium on 37th, north side of the block, in the high 80&#039;s (maybe 90th-91st)? The owner was a jolly older gent who would make deliveries of large orders using an old wooden pushcart. I remember our first aquarium being delivered by him that way.

				Wow I just found this site. And just finished reading this entire thread. I was born in the Heights and lived there for 41 years, until 12 years ago. <br /><br />I&#039;m getting nostalgic now hearing about all the places that I went to while growing up and as an adult. <br /><br />I used to hang out at Northern Lanes bowling alley on 75th &amp; Northern---we lived right behind the parking lot. My friends and I &quot;owned&quot; the place until it closed.<br /><br />Does anyone remember the little card/gift shop that was next to the Green Theme florist on 75th &amp; 37th Ave? I used to spend so much money on the great cards and other items in that shop. <br /><br />Used to work at the grandly named &quot;Jackson Heights Institute for Music and Dancing&quot; on 82nd Street between 37th &amp; Roosevelt. I worked there when Larry Downes was a guitar instructor there, before he opened his own place on 37th Ave. I would love to get in touch with him again.<br /><br />My brother owned &quot;Arts &#039;n Flowers&quot; florist on the corner of 81st and 37th. The whole family always helped out on the holidays and we got to know so many people in the area.<br /><br />Went to PS 69, and then the first year of 6th grade ever at IS 145. That year there were 2 graduating classes at PS 69 - 6th graders and 5th graders. I felt like&nbsp; pioneer.

				Hey, FiveFootZero, I was driving up 80th tonight and I stopped at the red light at Northern.&nbsp; They must be doing some kind of construction, because a couple of the store&#039;s on the south side of Northern had their signs down.&nbsp; The bare concrete was exposed and there it was--the old painted sign for &quot;Lee&#039;s&quot;.&nbsp; Actually there were two &quot;Lee&#039;s&quot; signs side by side covering two store fronts.&nbsp; It was like a time warp.

It was Sam&#039;s Liquor Store, Sam always&nbsp; gave me pennies when I went in there with my father. <br /><br />On the corner of 73rd St. and 37th road where Kabbab King is now, there used to be a place called Dumbarton Oaks, it was a stripper bar but prior to that it was actually a respectable restaurant (or so I&#039;ve been told).<br /><br />On the same block just past the Eagle (or Earle) theater there was a pizza shop, Benny and Tony were the father son team that ran the place. Sal&#039;s barber shop (now on 76th st.) was also there. Sal still cuts my hair some times. A tiny little deli that never seemed to do any business, and The Magic Touch an old style gay bar. Across the st. there was a type writer repair show. which lasted for the longest time and I believe was replaced by a travel agent. <br /><br />Going west on Broadway where the Korean Market is now, there used to be an A&amp;P.<br /><br />One more block west at 72nd and Broadway there was Gibbons, an Irish bar &amp; restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over to 37th ave. near 79th St. where Novo currently is was Barrs Toy store.

Roosevelt Ave. became very dirty looking. I used to love going to FIELDS, it was a beautiful store, We had an A&amp;P supermarket on 71st. and Roosevelt. Later on I have been going to check out to see what is new in my old neighborhood, and I have found that it is scaring, I would not like to find myself walking out there in the evening, like I used to do when I used to walk to 82nd. street at anytime. How sad it is to see what is going on on Woodside Avenue. Two blocks of line up men waiting to be picked up to work &quot;jornaleros&quot; I was traveling by car and when I stopped there waiting for the traffic light, I looked at those men and they started to show me the finger. That it is scaring, and that picture distroys a neighborhood. And with the prices they are asking for properties you can buy a mansion in New Jersey, where I moved when I left Jackson Heights. If the neighborhood is not clean, what would happened to people&#039;s investments? Or who would buy an apartment for a quarter of a million in this neighborhood? I am very sad to see that this happened in Jackson Heights. I told my husband one day that when my kids got out of the house him and I will go back to Jackson Heights where we wouldn&#039;d have to drive anymore, but no way, I really don&#039;t feel it could be safe.

				I lived in JH from the early 40s to the early 50s--went to PS 69 (anybody remember Miss Urquhart?) and JHS 145 when Moses Nagelberg was the principal. The only teachers I remember are Dr. Fabricante (French) and Milton Okun (music).<br /><br />I lived at 34-31 81st St. Everyday we walked to PS 69 and back. The favorite place to hang out was Moe&#039;s and Archie&#039;s, across the street from the school. It was, literally, a glass of seltzer for 2 cents.<br /><br />My classmates were Peter Lengyel, Alan Putterman, Al Rosenthal, Allen Gibbons. Friends were Frank Locastro, Judge Hayes, Skip Graves.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I had to go back to 145 to get some records to settle a passport/birth certificate problem--unbelieveably, they still had them, even from PS 69. Evidently at 69 I was a fairly asthmatic and sickly little wimp.

				Milt Okun was a fine teacher who had quite a life after 145. Here&#039;s what Wikipedia has to say: &quot;Milt Okun (born 23 December 1923 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American arranger and record producer best known as a member of The Belafonte Folk Singers with Harry Belafonte.<br /><br />Okun also recorded several albums of his own in the 1960s. Has made arrangements or produced for a large number of well-known artists such as Peter Paul and Mary, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Brothers Four, and John Denver. In 1968 he interviewed many American folksingers and published the songs they chose in Something to Sing About! (New York: Macmillan Company).&quot;<br /><br />As far as I know he is still going strong.

				I lived on 77 th street in JH between 1964 and 1968. Our house was about 100 yards from PS 69 next door to an Italian kid named Bruski. I attended JP Junior High School 145 for 1 year from Sept.1967 to June 1968 in a class that was supposedly for high IQ kids. (2 years of Junior High completed in 1 year.) I remember going with my parents to 74 th street for our weekly shopping every Friday when my dad would bring home his paycheck. I remember the A&amp;P supermarket and Woolworth&#039;s on one side of the street (east) and the butchers just across. There was also a toy store on the same side of the street that I used to visit often. My favourite store was on Roosevelt Av. on the south side somewhere between 77 and 74th street. It was a bicycle store where my father bought me a Schwinn (I don&#039;t know if that is spelled correctly) bike model &quot;Orange crate&quot; it was called. It was stolen from me within the first couple of weeks. I was standing less than 20 ft from it parked outside my house when some kid from another neighborhood jumped on it and started to peddle like hell. I gave chase for several blocks and watched him gradually fade into the distance. A few days latter my dad bought for me the exact same bike and 2 months later we moved out of the neighborhood. I was 13 years old at the time and I enjoyed life in JH despite this incident.

				Just found this board..man brings back memories<br />I was born and raised in JH and lived there from 1944 &#039;til 1980<br />So many memories&nbsp; BIG Question&nbsp; does anyone remember the Toddle House on 77th and 37th Ave and most important does anyone know the recipe for their home fries ( hash browns).<br />I&#039;d kill for a serving&nbsp; ( people look at me like I&#039;m nutz when I mention it)&nbsp; I go so far back that I remember the big field that was there before they built Elmhurst General..they used to have circuses and carnivals there. When I was little I used to play in the empty lot that is now the library on 81st Street and right next store to the lot was my buddy Steve the Cleaners. Remember the Good Humor ice cream guy that rode around on a big tricycle cart and a Fudgiscle was a nickel.&nbsp; Used to buy my pink Spauding at Weiss&#039;s Stationary on 37th between 81st and 82nd had to try every ball to find the hardest one&nbsp; (which royally pissed off the owners)&nbsp; My teachers at PS69 were&nbsp; 1st Mrs. Melemed&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; Miss Hald&nbsp; (shudder) 3rd Mrs. Baker (awesome) 4th Mrs. Schlang (The worst) 5th Mrs. McKee&nbsp; (used to lock me in the coat closet for being such a smart ass) 6th Mrs Polakoff Spent much of my allowance on vanilla egg cremes at Mom&#039;s candy store 37th between 80th and 81st<br />Man I could go on and on&nbsp; Hope to hear from some old timers

				Born in &#039;51, I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights my entire life. To comment on some of the things I&#039;ve just read: the store that once occupied the block between 81st &amp; 82nd on 37th Ave., was Fields. It had good quality clothes for the family. Eventually it became CSR or whatever it is and the quality is definitely long gone. Down 82nd was a women&#039;s store named Clarks that had somewhat pricey, but good quality ladies clothing. Across the street is where the Colony Theater used to be. On the other side of Roosevelt was the Jackson Theater recently closed. <br />The area now housing the Natives Restaurant on Northern Blvd. &amp; 82nd St. was the Boulevard Theater that also served as the place from which we graduates of JHS 145 said goodbye to junior high. Oh, Pulitzer, Oh, Pulitzer, the scene of happy days!!!<br />Some of the restaurants that are no longer serving the area are Luigi&#039;s and Dragon Seed, although the Cavalier is still sitting on 37th around 87th St. <br />There used to be a great gourmet food store on the corner of 76th &amp; 37th that had windows laden with string licorice, candy dots and all sorts of other &quot;penny&quot; candy that made me drool as a kid. Inside, of course, were all sorts of &quot;adult&quot; goodies like caviar, cheeses from around the world, etc. The store actually still exists on the other side of 37th &amp; 76th (going toward 35th avenue) but it is much smaller and no longer has all the goodies.<br />I grew up on 93rd St. &amp; Elmhurst Ave., diagonally across from the Polk Theater that was great until the early 70&#039;s when it went porno. Across from the Polk was a triangle street that went from 93rd to 94th Street and sat between Elmhurst &amp; 37th Aves. Sitting on this triangle was a large Carvel that, alas, closed years ago. The block has now been filled up with a variety of stores.<br />One staple of the area that has fought the changes seems to be Jahn&#039;s; long live the Kitchen Sink! <br />I know all I&#039;d have to do is start chatting with some of my old friends and more memories would come back. In the meantime, here&#039;s to Jackson Heights!<br /><br />

				I agree, I don&#039;t think we know each other. I grew up on 93rd Street and, although I went to JHS 145, I was there between 1963 thru 1966--then onto Newtown!! I only knew one person who went to 145 the same time as you and his name is Denny.

				My parents moved to Jackson Heights in June of 1951 when I was 6 weeks old.&nbsp; We lived at 86-11 34th Avenue until 1965, when we moved to 33-27 91st Street in Southridge.&nbsp; I attended P.S. 149, JHS 145 (Pulitzer), Newtown for one year and two years at The Garden School.&nbsp; I moved out of Jackson Heights in 1974 when I got married, but I return from time to time.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve established my street cred, let me share some of my recollections.&nbsp; <br /><br />Teachers at 149 included:&nbsp; Miss Jankowski, Miss Torsney, Mrs. Clark, Miss Vonderheid,&nbsp; Miss Hartman, Mrs. Blaha and Mrs. Brown.&nbsp; The principals were Miss Hearn and Mr. Price.&nbsp; At 145 my teachers included Mr. Horowitz (band and orchestra); Mrs. Rubin, Mr. Sloan and Mrs. Haines (math); Mrs. Hayes, Mrs. Seidenberg and Mrs. Galland (English); Mr. Bart, Mr. Brooker (science); Mr. Lipman and Mr. Barouh (social studies): Mrs. Tucker and Mr. Jehlen (French); Mr. Adolph (social dance); Mr. Antocicco and Mr. Sandler ( gym); Mr. Butler, Mr. Babb and Mr. Reddick (hygiene).&nbsp; The principal was Dr. Nagelberg and the assistant principals were Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bock. I also remember an Elmer Spiegler, but I don&#039;t remember what subject he taught.<br /><br />Jackson Heights had several movie theaters: The Boulevard on Northern and 83rd St. (my class at Pulitzer held its graduation there), the Colony on 82nd Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenue, the Earle on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th Streets, the Polk on 37th Avenue between 93rd and 94th Streets and the Fair on Astoria Boulevard between 90th and 91st Streets.&nbsp; Although technically in Elmhurst, the Jackson on 82nd Street south of Roosevelt Avenue was always considered to be one of the &#039;nabes&#039;.

				(This is a continuation of an earlier post) &nbsp;My long time barber Sal, was the third chair at Joe &amp; Angelo&#039;s on 37th Avenue between 83rd and 84th Streets. Our regular Chinese restaurant was Moon Garden on the north side of Northern Boulevard between 89th and 90th Streets, the same block as Safeway Super Market which later became Dan&#039;s Supreme. On the northwest corner of 90th and Northern was a luncheonette. &nbsp;On the south side of Northern was &nbsp;Whelan Drugs, &nbsp;the Old Acquaintance Tavern, a liquor store, Dresswell Cleaners, a Kosher Deli, Kayar Bakery (later Pizza Sam&#039;s) and Joe&#039;s Candy Store (later Al&#039;s Candy Store).<br /><br />Between 87th and 88th Streets on the north side of Northern Boulevard was a Carvel and one block to the west, between 86th and 87th Streets was a hobby shop called Racarâ€™s which sold model kits, lanyard and crafts material and had a slot car track set up for the use of its patrons. <br /><br />My dentist was Dr. Bogart on 82nd Street between 34th and 35th Avenues, just across from the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights where I attended Hebrew school and became a Bar Mitzvah in 1964. RenÃ©e Paris who had a major supporting role in the 1974 film, The Lords of Flatbush was in my class at Pulitzer as was current U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder, Jr. To be continued.<br />

				(This is a continuation of an earlier post) There were four bowling alleys: &nbsp;34th Lanes on 34th Avenue between 69th and 70th Streets (technically Woodside), Northern Lanes between Northern Boulevard and 32nd Avenue in the 70â€™s, Montclair Lanes below street level on 37th Avenue and about 75th Street, and another below street level place between 83rd and 84th Street on 37th Avenue, next door to Joe &amp; Angeloâ€™s Barbers. <br /><br />There was an old time pharmacy, Palladinoâ€™s, on the southeast corner of Northern Boulevard and 82nd Street across from the Conway Funeral Home. &nbsp;Crossing over 82nd Street, still on the south side of Northern Boulevard was a Manufacturerâ€™s Trust Bank, The Tune Timers Club (a night spot) and an A&amp;P. &nbsp;On the opposite side of Northern Boulevard was the fire house and one of the two great toy stores I remember from the 1950â€™s, Aladdinâ€™s. The other toy store I remember being taken to was Gerstenhaberâ€™s on Roosevelt Avenue somewhere in the 80â€™s.<br /><br />On 37th Avenue between 82nd and 83rd Street were Womrathâ€™s Books and Florsheim Shoes. &nbsp;And across 37th Avenue from where Fieldâ€™s Department Store used to be on the northwest corner of 82nd Street was a huge Rexall drug store which subsequently housed the Jamaica Savings Bank when they moved from the northeast corner of 37th Avenue and 81st Street. &nbsp;On 82nd Street between 37th Avenue and Roosevelt, some of the major retailers included: &nbsp;Woolworthâ€™s, Kresgeâ€™s, Mishkin Drugs, Benjamin Shoes, Clarkâ€™s Department Store, Horn &amp; Hardart, Cushmanâ€™s Bakery, Regal Shoes, Miles Shoes, Simco Shoes, Harveyâ€™s Menâ€™s Wear, and Rauchâ€™s Childrenâ€™s Wear.<br /><br />

				I have lived in JH all my life (58 Years). I have seen many many changes.&nbsp; Where should I start:<br /><br />The Renisance School 81 St 37 Ave. - before it was the horrible C&amp;S Dept Store, It was Fields Department Store. It was a beautiful store.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the best - 82 St between 37th Ave and Roosvelt Ave. - Where Rite Aid is now...used to be Schraf&#039;s Restaurent, and very quant eatery. My aunt used to take my sister and I on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We would dress in our Sunday best.<br /><br />Across the street was Horn &amp; Hardart which was an automat (put money in slot and select your food). They made the best cheese cake and tapioca pudding.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the corner was a Fanny Farmer candy store. Yum<br /><br />Don&#039;t know what&#039;s there now, but there was an elegant women&#039;s store called Clark&#039;s.&nbsp; There was also a store in the early 70s called Something Else sold beautiful clothes for younger women. My friend and I used to go there every Saturday to buy a new outfit to wear to go Disco&#039;ing Saturday nite.<br /><br />On the corner of 86 St and 37th Ave (Someone mentioned already) the Dragon Seed.&nbsp; Went there on my second date with my husband <br />remember it very well, the waiter had one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;Went to Ballet School at St Joan of Arc&#039;s basement on Saturday&#039;s Many wonderful memories of growing up in JH :D<br /><br /><br /><br />

				OMG forgot about Benjamin shoes, and miles. What about Florsheim on corner of 82 St and 37 Ave. Where chase bank is now, on 82 St between 37/Roosevelt it was Woolworths a 5 &amp;10 cent store. They had a food counter, they had these baloons that you would select one, pop it and depending on how much the paper said in side that&#039;s how much you would pay for a Sunday. Oh don&#039;t forget Jahn&#039;s 81St and 37th Ave, when it was your birthday you got a free Sunday. It&#039;s still there, but it&#039;s not the same.

				Going back a little further, the southeast corner of 35th Ave and 95th St used to be a vacant lot--through the late 50s/early 60s. 35-15 95th St was the apartment building adjacent to that lot. My family lived in that building. The lot was our playground, stickball field, horseshoe pit etc. Every summer there was a fair on the spot too. I forget who put it on (Blessed Sacrament?) but there was the full gamut of arcade games including the ubiquitous tossing of a ping-pong ball into little goldfish bowls, which won me my first pet at age 6. My mom won a set of dishes there, as I recall.

				....Kayar Bakery (later Pizza Sam&#039;s) and Joe&#039;s Candy Store (later Al&#039;s Candy Store)..... one block to the west, between 86th and 87th Streets was a hobby shop called Racarâ€™s which sold model kits, lanyard and crafts material and had a slot car track set up for the use of its patrons. <br /><br />I spent a good part of 1963-1965 in Racar (AKA George&#039;s Hobby Shop) and remember Kayar deli very well where I went, almost daily, for my single portion blueberry pie....I remember the owner telling me he was going to retire and that a pizza place was going to take over....after moving back to NYC from Florida in 1969, I got me first real job at Pizza Sam....anybody remember Augie?<br /><br />I really miss those day: Much simpler and fun was free.<br /><br />

				Wonderful thread and forum. Reading thru this was lotsa fun - thx to all the contributers!!! I have lived in Jackson Heights for over 30 years - let&#039;s see if I can fill in some gaps:<br />RS91885 - I do not recall the exact name of the pharmacy you mentioned - but I remember it like yesterday. The owner&#039;s name was Steve. He actually turned the property into a very nice take out sandwich cafe which didn&#039;t last all too long. This was on the corner of 83rd and 37th.<br />I recall that Demarco furniture had two stores -the one on 37th and I believe another on Northern blvd.<br />Arts and Flowers was a wonderful shop - they supplied all the beautiful flowers for my wedding. There was another very nice flower shop called Keffas - across from Joey D&#039;s on the other side of the tresel on 82nd street.<br />For a short while next to Joey D&#039;s (or maybe at their location) was a hamburger joint with the best french fries called Checkers.<br />Really4Rob - I was waiting for someone to mention the Arthur Treachers on 82nd st. Goodness that pizza shop right by it had to be the narrowest food establishment I can recall.<br />Here&#039;s a good one - on Roosevelt Ave there was a small convienance store within a gas station - they had real chocolate milk in the bottle -late 70&#039;s early 80&#039;s I recall - those bottles of milk were a real treat. <br />There was another small toy store near that triangle on 90th street by the number 7 line.<br /><br />Marval&#039;s (not sure I spelled this one right) originally on Roosevelt avenue moved to where the supermarket Fishers used to be - near Luigi&#039;s on 84th and 37th<br />Wasn&#039;t there a small bowling alley next to Fishers?<br />On 82nd was a large jewerly store called Moniques near the 7 train. They had a sister store directly across the street.<br />Wasn&#039;t Fair the linen and glassware store on 82nd street that moved to the Middlevillage area?<br />What many people didn&#039;t realize was that in the back of the used book store there was a special room filled with really good titles. I think that you had to be friends with the owners for them to let you inside. Wasn&#039;t there always a dog in their shop?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				These a few more places that I recall - El Inca resturant on Roosevelt Ave and I believe 86th street. That had this one dish El Inca potato soup that was out of this world. Whenever a customer took a cigarette out a waiter would be there to light it up before it even touched the person&#039;s mouth. <br />It might have been mentioned but Clappers was the very fine clothing store on 82nd street which later moved to I believe Junction Blvd.<br />Of all the many different supermarkets in our neighborhood - I always thought that that Dan&#039;s on Northern was the best of all.<br />Wasn&#039;t there a huge outdoor fruit and veggie market called Top Tomato on Roosevelt avenue?<br />On Northern Blvd there was a nice seafood resturant called Martha&#039;s Vineyard. They reopened into a larger location on Northern and also offered Chinese food.<br />The candy/newspaper store between 84th/85th street and 37th ave. has been there aloong time with many different owners.<br />Lady Algene (not sure if I spelled this correctly) was a jeweler on 37th avenue whose original owner was the spitting image of Marlin Brando in the Godfather. <br />I&#039;m sure that in the coming days several more places will come to mind.<br />

				I remember Molly&#039;s candy store well, I lived right up the block on 75th Street.&nbsp; We called it &quot;Sam&#039;s&quot; I don&#039;t recall the name &quot;Lefty.&quot;&nbsp; Molly&#039;s was one of a number of &quot;candy&quot; stores in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; They had more or less the same layout -- newspapers, magazines, racing forms, comic books, cigars, cigarettes and candy up front; six or eight seat soda fountain in the back.&nbsp; Being a kid and having no money I would quench my thirst on hot afternoons with a two cents plain, which was straight seltzer that could also be had in a larger glass for a nickle.&nbsp; I bought comic books and bubble gum cards at Sam&#039;s that have long ago become high priced collector&#039;s items.&nbsp; There were other candy stores in the neighborhood including one near the Earle theater run by the Begun family and, of course, Moe &amp; Archie&#039;s which was a major oasis to we kids who hung out in the P.S. 69 school yard.<br /><br />My most vivid memory of Moe &amp; Archie&#039;s was a large cooler that held bottles of Mission sodas and Yoohoo (Yogi Berra&#039;s favorite chocolate drink). Early in the summer, management would stock the cooler with sodas and a big block of ice.&nbsp; As summer progressed, the ice would melt and the water would get dirtier and dirtier thanks to dozens of grubby little paws fishing for bottles of sickly sweet Cream Soda and Yoohoo.&nbsp; There were shards of broken glass in the murky water and more than one of us kids came away with bloody fingers.&nbsp; The cooler was a mess, but that didn&#039;t deter us. We were kids and dirt was no big deal.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hi all,<br /><br />I grew up in JH in the late 60s-70s, here&#039;s what I remember:<br /><br />On 73rd st near Roosevelt, a Chinese Laundry and a shoe repair shop. The bus terminal at 74th street. This used to have a Fanny Farmer chocolate store at the Broadway/ Roosevelt aAve intersection. Downstairs in the train station there used to be a Nediks and some small shops. Opposite Fanny Farmer, There was a dry cleaners by the subway entrance, a liquor store (still there), a fruit stand, a Hallmark card store, and a drug store.<br /><br />74th street shops, Essex House Coffee shop, La Conca de Oro Pizzeria, Lamstons 5 &amp; 10, Ferns stationary and toys, Ferns Record shop and sporting goods (opened a couple of doors down) Big 4 Meats, a children&#039;s clothing store (don&#039;t recall the name), a woman&#039;s undergarments store, a jewelry store, Key Food, The original small Jackson diner, Jay Dee Bakery and Fashion Rack. Later came Sam &amp; Raj, the first Indian electronics store in the neighborhood.<br /><br />On 37th Ave between 74th &amp; 75 th streets was Joseph of Italy beauty salon, next to that was a hardware store/housewares, I can&#039;t recall the name of. Armondos restaurant and La Portena have been there for a number of years and Carvel ice cream store. I also recall a fish store with sawdust and live crabs and lobsters. I think this may have been on Roosevelt near the Chase Manhattan Bank that&#039;s still there.<br /><br />Further up was Dairy Queen (across from the Post Office), Numbers records and tapes (probably the second Indian business) KFC, an old used book store, Guilietta pizzeria (which had the first Sicilian slices that I can remember) Fields Department store, and of course Jahns. On Roosevelt was the great Toy City toy store. This had sporting goods, hobbies, dolls, games, everything you could imagine! <br /><br />82nd street I recall a photography studio, A jewelry store, Woolworth&#039;s (with a great Luncheon counter), Buster Brown Shoes, Clarks department store, The Record Room, Burger Nest, Chock full o Nuts.<br /><br />and of course there was the great Dragon Seed Polynesian Chinese Restaurant with its tiki huts, Pu Pu platter, friendly staff dressed in flowered shirts, tiki glasses, puffer fish lamps, great BBQ spare ribs and fried rice with egg in it! Ah what memories! those were the days! I&#039;m sure I missed some places, but this is what sticks out fro my ch oldhood memories of shopping with my mother after school. &nbsp;I wish I could see pictures from that time. Anyone know of a site that posts old pics of the nabe?

				Hi from Northridge 1952<br /><br />Grew up in JH from 1952-1968. Many memories. Went to 148. My teachers-Mrs.Lorimer,Crossmen,Silverstein,Duffy,Katz and Farrely. Many hours spent playing handball. Have been in Australia since 1974. Let me try to remember some shops...<br />A 5 and 10 store on 33rd and 90th, UN Dry Cleaners on 89th and Northern, Moons Garden Chinise on the same street as well as the Kayar bakery, a candy store on the corner and one directly across the street. A frozen custard place on 88th and Northern that opened with a 2 for 1 special. A Car Wash on 88th and Northern. A vacant lot on 93rd and Northern where there was a fair every year and also a baseball field. I may have some of the locales wrong but see how close I am.<br /><br />As they say in Melbourne, Australia-Cheers

				I was born and raised in Jackson Heights from 1958 until 1981.<br /><br />I was there the night Hamburger Express burned down...me and my friends all gathered around and watched the firefighters try to put out the flames.&nbsp; The restaurant was totally destroyed and a Baskin and Robbins was built in its place.&nbsp;

				I thought Abehill was also on 74th St. Were Butala is.<br /><br />Between 81st &amp; 80th was Sullivan&#039;s Butcher, a candy store (I think) and the Christian Science Reading Room next to what is now Italian Farms.

				Physicians Hospital was the place my uncle went for a hernia operation and was in the place for the next 3 months back in the 50&quot;s. The Dr&#039;s there were really creepy. He must of had a good Blue Cross/Shield policy.<br /><br />Speaking of great soda places Jyust (Joost pronounced) had the best black and white sodas and the candy store opposite accross Northern Blvd to the west of the Boulevard Movie Theater Maxies had great Bryers ice cream milk shakes.<br /><br />There was a mens habidasher&nbsp; on 82Nd between 37th and Roosevelt Ave. on the east side named Cyril Anderson&#039;s that had really good upscale clothes. Mr. Anderson was an Englishman, very pleasant and half of Jackson Heights teenage boys were in like with his beautiful. smart daughter Lori. I believe she became a famous womens clothes designer after graduating from Syracuse Univ.<br /><br />In the late 40&#039;s early 50&#039;s there was a spectacular hamberger place on SW corner of 77th and 37th Ave, EDSON&#039;S, where our pal Pete Edsons dad cooked by the plate glass window. Pete worked for Ray Kroc in the early 60s as the guy who selected franchisees for McDonalds before they went public.<br /><br />Lots of really nice people chose Jackson Heights to live in. Nifty place to grow up in, even though the developers took all our lots away from us.&nbsp; <br /><br />7th and 37 Ave <br />

				Hey, Tarbender, I remember all those places even though I&#039;m a girl (no Andersons). I used to read the comic books in Maxies and get a vanilla soda.<br /><br />I&#039;m still in JH and half a century later, I STILL resent them building on the lots!<br /><br />My folks had victory gardens behind Saint Mark&#039;s Church.

				Good morning! We also had a family Victory Garden in our lot (all the neighbors) on the corner of 82nd St. &amp; 35th Ave. NW where we all grew tomatoes, carrots, etc. around the edges. Was in the Cub Scouts at St. Mark&#039;s Pack 201. Pastor was Scofield and Cub Master Fuller. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school (right alongside Garden Country Day) then to kindergarten at P.S. 69, and grammar school at St. Joan of Arc. My folks moved to JH when they were married in 1930 and both passed away in JH in the 80&#039;s. Great memories.

				i&#039;m an interloper --only been here for 17 years -- but i LOVE hearing stories right from the source.<br /><br />not long after i moved into my very first place alone -- in 1981, at east 6th and ave D in manhattan-- the doorbell rang, and an elderly gentleman was on the stoop. he told me he&#039;d lived there as a child in the early &#039;20s and asked if he could come in. i brought him in, and he had an hour&#039;s worth of lovely tales of the folks who&#039;d lived there then. it was an irreplaceable moment.

				Hi Dss,<br /><br />No problem, it is nice to know that others appreciate our memories. When you get older, I&#039;ve thought we become invisible to the younger people. (Yes, I know mixed tenses, etc in that sentence). JH to us as kids seemed quieter.<br /><br />But you should know that Roosevelt Ave was always formidable. Noisy, dirty, only one or two shops, the toy store, Shelley&#039;s Bakery, Meyers diner and a&nbsp; Chock Full o&#039; Nuts are all I can remember. <br /><br />On the other side of Roosevelt there was a Sears where they sold tools and lots of fishing tackle and ran the catalog business.<br /><br />Oh well, things do change and of course a kid wouldn&#039;t have noticed all the bars.<br />&nbsp;

				Cubs at St. Mark&#039;s were a real eye opener to me as a tenderfoot when on Saturdays there were paper drives, scrap metal collections, tires, that we would collect in our wagons and bring back to the parish house where fathers would sort and load them onto trucks to deliver to scrap dealers and raise funds for aiding &quot;DP&#039;s&quot; (displaced persons) and other deserving charities. Cleaned up the neighborhood to my eye and got a lot of junk out of basements, cellars, and garages. The same with clothing drives, bake sales, going to Veterans Hospitals and pushing wheel chair bound folk to their activities. All wonderful events and great experiences for young kids to participate. North pointing principles were the goal of Pack 201. Fine leadership by Fr. Schofield and Cub master Fuller. My hero at the time was an older boy Bobby Case who lived in my apt. building and he was probably (15-16) an Explorer Scout and introduced me (9) to his St. Mark&#039;s friends. Listening to their camping and Jamboree activities started my interest in real scouting later on. Amazing to still be able to remember the names and some faces of kids have not seen or heard from in 40 years. Johnny Williams, Jimmy Laffin, Kevin Gordon, Ted Schroetter, Dicky Ryan, Morgan Healy, Ed Mazilauskas, Charlie Ramos La Salle, Jimmy Buckland........what a bunch of feather-merchants!&nbsp; You are right about the memories. Nice and mellow.

				I grew up in Jackson Heights from 1951 (my birth year) to 1968, when my family moved to Laurelton. I went to PS 148 (1957-1963), JHS 145 (1963-66) and Newtown HS (1966-1968). In the late 50s/early 60s, my dad was a manager in the Northern Blvd. Safeway someone mentioned here. It made me very sad to leave all the people I grew up with behind and move to another neighborhood. I spent my senior year and graduated from Springfield Gardens HS, but it may as well have been on the Moon, it seemed so far away.

				Wow this posting shows how different our territories were. I was on 34th &amp; 83rd so we tended to shop on 37th or Northern between 77-78 up to 86th.

				Was just reading where someone couldn&#039;t remember shopping on Roosevelt Avenue with the exception of Keffas Florist and I remember going to the A&amp;P on Roosevelt Avenue and 85th Street before the A&amp;P opened on Northern Blvd between 81st and 82nd street. And also the Army Navy Surplus Store on Roosevelt and 83St. (Southside) and a great Italian Restaurant (cheap and cheerful) for Pizza and Spagetti name LIDO on Roosevelt and 81st Street and just thought of Sears Roebuck big store on Roosevelt and 86th Street, As well as a &quot;FROZEN CUSTARD&quot; store on Roosevelt and 83rd (which became a CARVEL) and on the corner of 82nd just past the Cushmans Bakery an ice cream parlor that I don&#039;t remember the name of, second only to &quot;Joust&quot; soda store on Northern Blvd. and 83rd next to Conways Funeral Parlor, and accross from the Boulevard Movie Theater and Maxie&#039;s &quot;candy store&quot; that sold the wonderful bulk Breyer&#039;s ice cream.

				That was Meyers. Joel Meyers, the son, was in my graduating class at Garden -1959. Not sure where he is now.<br /><br />I LOVED Sears because I went with my dad. He would get hardware and I marveled over the fishing supplies. Boy, Girl, life was simpler then.

				Time was around 1945-55, when my dad used to take me shopping at Sears Roebuck. Actually, my first two wheel bike was bought there it was a J.C. Higgins and had tail lights when you stepped on the brakes. Big fat wheels so rough on hills. There was a great hill for sleigh riding on the &quot;golf course&quot; which was on 78th Street (I believe) between 34th and 35th. In 1947 or 8 there was a big time snowstorm so we were sledding for days. Do you remember the Hobby Hub on 82nd past Roosevelt almost to Elmhurst? Had model planes and cars that the owner helped us build and if you could afford it, engines for them. The owner was a nice guy who was a former Marine and helped us get started building them.

				One of the insidious things about still living here is that the changes creep up. A store here, one there, then you forget about Baar&#039;s, the toy store. Schrafft&#039;s, the book store at the corner of 84th and 37th.&nbsp; I could go on, but if you are old enough, no one else knows about these things except here.<br /><br />The Victory Gardens all over the neighborhood are one of my strongest memories.<br /><br />Sigh

				Thanks for this picture of Fields Department store. I remember the day I got my boy scout uniform there and became a proud member of the troop based at P.S.69. I never rose above 1st class scout level and can&#039;t recall any of the knots we had to learn but I do have very fond memories of the cobra patrol that I was part of.

				Just read your missive about Fields and buying your Boy Scout uniform there. The Cobra Patrol was led by a great scout named Ted Schroetter. Was wondering if he was there when you were. I spent time as the patrol leader of the Shooting Star patrol and then was the SPL (senior patrol leader) at Troop 217 in P.S. 69. I hear from Ted frequently and I&#039;m sure he would be happy to hear about a former Cobra patrol member on the Jackson Heights Life. All the best to you.

				<br />I can&#039;t remember at what age I joined the scouts-I guess I was around&nbsp; 11(1954?). The troop meetings were in the evening and involved all the patrols lining up to be addressed by the Scoutmaster who I think was called Mr. K. the K being short for a longer name that might have been something harder to pronounce.The ceremonial aspects of scouting have faded to some extent although the Scoutmaster&#039;s parting benediction to us all at the end of the evening for some reason and after all these years remains&quot;May the Great Scoutmaster of all good scouts look after thee and me until we meet again. Troop attention!&quot; I think that&#039;s a rough approximation.<br /><br />The bonus for all that was the end of evening game of Russian Bulldog-great fun that was too. Finally the walk home to 72nd street and the peeking in at the mysterious Blue Haven, Jackson Heights&#039;only and now last night club.<br /><br />My patrol leader was by the way Brad Jayner -why I still remember his name after what feels like a millennial age ago is an open question and one that confounds me.It is in any event now part of my own treasury of Happy Days in the old Jackson heights.

				Great memory of Scoutmaster K&#039;s closing admonition. In 1953 a bunch of 217 scouts went to the Jamboree at the Irvine Scout Ranch in Irvine, California. Ted Schroetter, Burt Herman, Alfie Tisch, Rolf Barth, Jimmy Robinson and myself all went by train, no a/c, stopping along the way to visit D.C, St. Louis, Kansas City, Pike Peak, Albequerci, Nevada, and then the northern route home. Quite an experience meeting scouts from all over the world and swapping our kerchifs for theirs and bringing Texas horned toads home to JH. There were some fantastic night ceremonies with celebrity entertainers and 40,000 scouts joining in and being dazzled by the lighting and the moment. At 217 we were fortunate to have an excellent scoutmaster named Bob Howard for almost 3 years who was a doer, teacher, solid leader who everyone admired. A Boys Life editor, Bob Brooks, took over on a temporary basis when Mr. Howard moved to New Jersey. Brooks was a whirlwind of activity and camping trips. JH had 3 Boy Scout troops in 1950, P.S. 69, Community Church and St. Mark&#039;s.

				Chuckster--the toy store was around 83rd St., and was Gerstenhaber&#039;s. They had quite a selection of tin soldiers, among other things. A wonderful store.<br /><br />Tarbender--my brother knew Rolf Barth, and was in Bob Brook&#039;s Explorer post. I was too young and he moved on with Boy&#039;s Life to N.J. before I was an Explorer. The post went from about 80 scouts to three. <br />Got a lot of tools at Sears and wool shirts at the Army/Navy store.<br /><br />Great shot of Fields.<br /><br />joepartytime--we lived in the apartment below Dave Goldstein. Remember the empty store next door in which he kept his empty bottles? Never worked for him, but I did &#039;run drugs&#039; for Meyer Banchefsky, Terrace Towers Pharmacy. He was a great influence on me, and I earned enough to buy a Heathkit tape recorder.

				There was a couple who lived in our 82nd Street apartment, I can only remember his name Kelvin Keech, who was a NBC radio announcer for the show Terry and the Pirates and several others. His wife was Russian and her brothers were Whites with the Russian Cavalry who battled against the Reds. Lots of young people interested in the theater and radio business used to say Mr. Keech was very helpful to them in their interest with advise and introductions. Right on the block with the Continental Restaurant, past the Singer Sewing Machine Store and Womrath Book Lending Store was a dry cleaning store, I believe Columbia Cleaners, with a lovely owner Mrs. Kramer who always wore the U.S. Army Aircorp pilot &quot;Wings&quot; that belonged to her son who was killed in action. This lovely lady was our local Mrs. Minever with a courageous attitude, always pleasant and upbeat. The padres from St. Joan of Arc rectory around the block were big fans of hers and pointed to one and all that she was a hero and we should all&nbsp; honor her.

				On the east side of Junction Blvd in the 1950s-- a few doors down from Buster Brown Shoes, a bank, and a luncheonette, there was a store whose main enterprise was cooked rotisserie chickens. Does anyone remember the name of this place? The proprietor&#039;s name was Bert.

				I was born and pretty much raised in JH from 1959 on. MY parents moved here in the 50&#039;s, when they finally let Irish in.&nbsp; Their friends and neighbors were from around the world and my first crush was on my neighbor Adele, from England when were were 6.&nbsp; My mom at one point worked at King Edward&#039;s on 77 Street across from PS 69 and my sister&#039;s high school job was at Field&#039;s.&nbsp; At this time JH had a very large population of Jewish people from the holocaust, of which my parents were friends with.&nbsp; The first big change in the neighborhood was the Elmhurst hospital&#039;s treatment of drug use in the 60&#039;s.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t remember it I heard of countless protests as this was seen to have a negative impact to the neighborhood.&nbsp; There was still segregation here as there were few Blacks or Chinese in the JH.&nbsp; In the 70&#039;s the next big turn was the opening off the drug trade with Columbia. JH was the centerpoint&nbsp; for cocaine for the US and even Escobar took up residence here.&nbsp; Little by little the shops around JH ( especially 82nd Street) that rivaled Manhattan were disappearing.&nbsp; As it turns out now much of the white flight is now exposed to the banking practices of redlining.&nbsp; This was the time JH lost it&#039;s community to be replaced by drug trade.&nbsp; It was so bad that that it was not uncommon to find a body in PS 69 or someone&#039;s backyard.&nbsp; At this point all the buildings started to fence up what was once open. As kids we could go around ten blocks across through the backyards. By the 80&#039;s crack and freebase were now ubiquitous,&nbsp; and the Irish bars all over Roosevelt Avenue were being robbed.&nbsp; These old timers had enough and packed it in, changing hands to the new neighbors moving in and not only a direct line for drugs but prostitution, which is where Roosevelt Ave has stood, all while the police either made money on this or just refused to do anything. I surmise the first as Serpico pointed it out. To be continued...

				very interesting and straight forward story, buzz. regarding Escobar living here, I had not heard that before. He isn&#039;t listed as a resident on Wikipedia. I wonder if there is any way that could be confirmed. That would have been in the 1980s or 90s. de Dios Unanue was assasinated in 1992.

				I lived in Elmhurst, close to Roosevelt in the 60&#039;s. Does anyone remember Savin, the discount store on Roosevelt, bet 90-91 street, or the Golden Rice Restaurant which was next door? There was a fantastic pizzeria on 90 St and Roosevelt that was amazing! They also had rotisserie chicken. Does anyone remember the (Italian) bread bakery on 90 Street,?The Dragon Seed, the one near Junction had the best butterfly shrimp with bacon. All of these places are long gone.

				I grew up in Jackson Heights from 1950. Went to St Joan of Arc. I remember when the church was just one level and it was what is now called the lower church. The upper church was completed arouund 1952 and Father Boylan was the pastor.&nbsp; Across from St Joans on the north west side of 35th ave between 82nd and 83rd was a park with lots of grass and benches.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fields was the best store in the neighborhood. Across from Fields on 82 St was a <br />liquor store, a beauty parlor, a tuxedo rental store, a candy store and Florshine shoes was on the corner.&nbsp; Across 37th ave was Baracini chocolate shop on one corner and Moss&#039;s drug store with a great soda fountain on the other corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where IS 145 is now there were tennis courts. <br />The neighborhood has changed so much, somehow it&#039;s a shame

				I think Chet had a brother who I didn&#039;t know. The period I am talking about is in the late 50&#039;s. I graduated from Bryant in 1960 -I think Alec would have been class of 59.

				just joined so sorry the post has been standing still for months, but had to join in. Fields&#039; was wonderful, Jay Dee was the best and the cinema, yes of course. We all played in vacant lots as well as punch ball every evening till called in for dinner or bedtime. I went to PS 89 and miss my 7th grade friends so much; they were mostly in Elmhurst and all of us came from very educated but not well-off European immigrant families.<br /><br />My father was a surgeon at Physicians&#039; Hospital along with Dr Rappaport, if I recall correctly after 6 decades. I remember loving to walk the neighbors&#039; dogs and wander around 37th Ave as if it were 5th Ave in Manhattan, admiring the shops. I did the food-shopping for my mother and felt very grown-up doing that. For 5th grade, I went to what was then called Garden Country Day School, run by Mr and Mrs. Flower, then Mr. Roberts. I was happier in PS 89, however, where I had Mr. O&#039;Neill as my 7th grade teacher. He treated us like adults and instilled in us a super keen interest in Education. First time ever for me! And it lasted...

After graduation in &#039;59, I lived with my family at 35-06 72nd Street for about a year, then got my own apartment in a building at the corner where Broadway and 37th Avenue met (70th Street) for about 2 years, before moving into Manhattan. Your mention of Bobby Polichek made me smile. I remember him so well as one of the best neighborhood athletes, along with Lou Bronzo and his brother. Bobby could run the pants of anyone playing one-on-one with him on the basketball court in P.S.69. He was also a degenerate horse player and hitch-hiked out to Aqueduct almost every day. Aah, memories. I&#039;ve got a boatload of them.

We also had a family Victory Garden in our lot (all the neighbors) on the corner of 82nd St. &amp; 35th Ave. NW where we all grew tomatoes, carrots, etc. around the edges. Was in the Cub Scouts at St. Mark&#039;s Pack 201. Pastor was Scofield and Cub Master Fuller. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school (right alongside Garden Country Day) then to kindergarten at P.S. 69, and grammar school at St. Joan of Arc.

Here&#039;s a list of the kids I grew up with and went to school with who were also Cub Scouts with me in Pack 201: Lou Resseguie, who went on to star in Broadway musicals (and who recently passed away), Joe Allen, who became a hugely successful restaurateur both nationally and internationally, Whitby Ellsworth, Albert McDonald, Gerry Neary and Seth Mosely. This became the nucleolus of our neighborhood sports team known as the Jackson Heights Trojans. In 1986 we organized a reunion of this gang of guys in a restaurant in Manhattan and 14 out of 18 of those we were successful in locating showed up with their wives. Also, one of members who couldn&#039;t attend, had his sister there as a stand-in. And, believe it or not, one of our &quot;Den Mothers&quot; from Pack 201 (the mother of two in the group attending) also came. It was one of the most nostalgic events of my life.&nbsp;
