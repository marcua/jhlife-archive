				I’m sick of getting nearly clipped constantly on 37th ave by these lunatic delivery drivers. How the hell are they allowed to drive&nbsp; on the sidewalks, let alone keep them parked all day.&nbsp; The Chinese delivery guy is the worst on 79th and 37th, he comes in extra hot usually From a one way (going wrong way).&nbsp; &nbsp;Metermaids just watch. <br /><br />Since we don’t have cops here in JH, I’m not sure who could correct this?!?&nbsp;

				these things are a real menace the way they&#039;re currently used. 37th is really bad, as are the main streets near our office in Tribeca (Church and Varick, particularly). i can&#039;t see how it&#039;s legal to drive them on the sidewalk, and i REALLY think the city should require a driver&#039;s license, if not a specialized license, to operate. they&#039;re not &quot;bicycles,&quot; no matter what the letter of the law currently says.

For example, the State will not register e-bikes. Some but not all Mopeds are eligible for registration as “limited use motorcycle&quot; and may be used legally on public thoroughfares. The State describes mopeds eligible for registration as two- or three-wheeled limited use vehicles equipped with either a seat or saddle for the rider. A “limited use vehicle,” as defined by the State, is a motor vehicle that can reach a maximum speed of no greater than forty miles-per-hour. A limited use vehicle—and thus, a limited use motorcycle—may not legally be operated in public unless it has been registered with the State Department of Motor Vehicles.<br /><br />The City Council banned motorized scooters in 2004. The Council declared that motorized scooters pose a risk to the health and safety of their users, passengers in nearby vehicles, and pedestrians. The Council cited a United States Consumer Product Safety Commission report that reported that thousands of instances of emergency room visits in the year 2000 were tied to motorized scooter use, and that more than a third of those injured were younger than fifteen years old. The Council further stressed that while scooters were originally produced for operation at slower speeds, today’s motorized versions operate at such a high speed that road users and pedestrians should be concerned, especially due to the lack of licensing and safety requirements imposed on the motorized scooter and their users.<br /><br />The Council’s 2004 law limited the ban to motorized scooters capable of traveling faster than fifteen miles-per-hour. In 2013, the Council dropped the speed criteria from the ban so that today, all motorized scooters are banned in New York City (NYC v. Onix Guzman, ECB Appeal No. 1501125 (Dec. 17, 2015)).<br /><br /><br />https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/motorized-devices-cannot-be-registered-new-york (https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/motorized-devices-cannot-be-registered-new-york)

				I&#039;m not a fan of ebikes particularly because they are nearly silent and really should never be allowed to be ridden in bike lanes.&nbsp; Perhaps some sort of &quot;sound generator&quot; should be installed so that pedestrians have advanced warning of their presence?<br />

				This.<br /><br />My wife told me that she and our son were inches from getting hit by one two weeks ago that was turning off a one-way street, going the wrong way, when they didn&#039;t have the light. She was livid, and started yelling at him, but he rode away.<br /><br />They should absolutely not be allowed to ride on the sidewalks. THEY ARE NOT PEDESTRIANS. Sorry if I&#039;m getting worked up, but this has grown to be a really touchy topic for me because of the numerous close-calls both me and my wife have had with our son. They&#039;re f&#039;n reckless and it&#039;s annoying as well. Just follow the rules of the road. It&#039;s not that hard.

				I am thoroughly confused, though not surprised, that someone would raise the idea that by calling this out as an issue suggests I somehow don&#039;t care about the delivery guy&#039;s livelihood.<br /><br />Let me make this abundantly clear: NO ONE is saying they can&#039;t make a buck doing what is unfortunately a thankless job. But you can do your job and still adhere to the rules of the road. The two are not mutually exclusive, and it&#039;s ridiculous that that&#039;s even being considered to be the case. These aren&#039;t small vehicles. These aren&#039;t even cyclists. The mopeds/scooters are large, heavy, and fast. They&#039;re closer related to motorcycles than they are to bicycles. Treat them as such and park them at the curb, stop at red lights, and don&#039;t drive against traffic.

				Yes! their needs to be some sort of order, keeping in mind we don&#039;t hurt or affect pedestrians, delivery drivers and business owners ! I personally know a few delivery driver in JH getting paid $9 an hour which is legal for tip employees and make an easy $120/ $150 in tips making that a whopping $1000/ 1200 a week (TAX FREE) Think about it some delivery guys are making more then the average.........
