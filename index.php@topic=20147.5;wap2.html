			Hi, thanks for everyone’s support and ideas.&nbsp; The little squirrel is doing well.&nbsp; We have created a bed in the garden’s shed and she (not sure of the sex) is eating the berries and peanut butter and other goodies we leave for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are also giving her baby formula which she laps up.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is very active during the day, and then comes back to the shed in the afternoon to nap.&nbsp; &nbsp;She really loves the garden, and we are hoping that she can thrive there.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is a group of us who are looking out for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fingers crossed!

			Hi, Babette (yes, we named the squirrel) is doing fine—eating lots of food, and getting bigger.&nbsp; She is staying in the shed most nights, and then hangs out in the garden during the day.&nbsp; She is just getting the hang of climbing trees, and hoping that she can live a long squirrel life.
