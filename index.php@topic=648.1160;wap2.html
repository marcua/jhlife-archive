			As that thread reads you were troll baiting my previous post by asking me what Gladys says. <br />The response was she can’t be bothered. And then a cut and paste from urban dictionary as to your names meaning.<br /><br />Please quote accurately and within context.<br /><br />God bless

			Peace. A Diwali/Hanukkah/Christmas/Kwanzaa miracle.<br /><br />i hope it lingers. and i really hope there&#039;s no actual animus here, just spirited (if sometimes uncouth) debate.<br /><br />Happy New Year, abcdefghijk. and see you on the next forum.
