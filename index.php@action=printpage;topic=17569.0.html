				I would much rather own one (1) share of Amazon at $1,525.00 then 28 shares of Delta at $55.00 a share.&nbsp; Delta shares by year end are going nowhere.&nbsp; I predict/project that Amazon will be $2,000.00 plus by year end and could double in 2 years.&nbsp; It&#039;s already up this year (7 weeks) 30%.&nbsp; Never invest based on emotions.&nbsp;

				AMZN does project well -- and will go even higher once the company signs on to the NRA boycott.<br /><br />only a matter of time, since it&#039;s run by &quot;Crooked&quot; (or is that &quot;Liddle&quot; or &quot;Lyin&#039;&quot; or whatever) Jeff Bezos, the guy with money that what&#039;s his name is always tweeting about <br /><br />:)

				Corporations don&#039;t have morals, they base their decisions on where they project the most profit lies.&nbsp; Currently, Delta thinks siding with advocates for gun control will make better economic sense for them.&nbsp; I would recommend doing exactly what they do and invest your money where it will do you the most good and shop where it benefits you most.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I think businesses should remain neutral, otherwise we run the risk of tit for tat economic vengeance against companies that don&#039;t toe the lines of various groups holding different political thoughts and we all suffer in the end with fewer choices and higher prices.&nbsp; I.e, the Law of Unintended Consequences is alive and well.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you feel you need to do something, then get involved on a personal level.<br /><br />

				My office just canceled our FedEx account and switched to UPS because of their stance on shipping guns. I was really surprised because I would have assumed we&#039;d remain neutral due to the nature of our org.&nbsp; &nbsp;
