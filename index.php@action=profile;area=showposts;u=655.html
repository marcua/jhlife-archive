					Apt #C51 is such a beautiful apartment. However I think the maintenance is a bit too high at $1787 in compare to most of the three bedrooms co-op in JH. With a listing prices at $935k. A 20% downpayment will be $187,000. And that’s not including closing cost yet.&nbsp; With the current mortgage rate at close to 3.5 for 30 years. Added the maintenance. Your monthly payment will be $5146 PER MONTH. And if you are lucky enough to saved up to 30% downpayment which is $280,500. Your monthly payment will be reduce to $4690 PER MONTH. However you still want to have a little bit saving left after you shell out almost close $300k of downpayment. I have to say who ever move in to those three bedroom apartments in WP has to have a really high income, or dual income, or even saved up a lot a lot money. Paying five thousand something a month just to live seems like a lot. Even you do pay down 50% of downpayment at $467,500 (which is a lot money o save).&nbsp; Your monthly payment will still be $3860. A little better now consider people are paying $3200 for one bedroom rental in Williamsburg.&nbsp; But it’s still a lot. Just my thought.

					I think more local people in Jackson Heights feels price out in their own neighborhood they grow up in. Because more and more people from other area such as Brooklyn or the city can afford the price here without any hesitation. They can sell their one bedroom apartment with a decent price to upgrade to a two bedroom or three in JH. I think that&#039;s what&#039;s driving the price up in Jackson Heights because these apartments still sells even the price seems to be high.

Same MO of slick advertising and office set up on site. Couldn&#039;t tell if they did the Continental in Elmhurst, but the sponsor was the same as the Birchwood.<br /><br />Nu-place sold dozens of apartments in the Birchwood in a month. The Continental also sold.

However Birchwood was a really nice building and sponsor owns most of these units. I think it&#039;s different story than Washington Plaza, where most of them still rent stabilized tenant. And buyers need to think about if they want to buy in a building that is mostly owner occupied or renters. It matters a lot when it&#039;s a co-op. Especially if the compelx has a hundred something units and they don&#039;t even own more then half of these units. However, if they are offering 10% downpayment and fully move in ready renovation. I think that&#039;s the catch people are willing to go for. It&#039;s not easy to save up 20% down payment with the recent sales prices plus a extra 50-60k cash side aside to renovate a unit. <br /><br />The same thing happen to Birchwood house, a studio apartment range from 187,500+. And that was 8 years ago&#039;s price. It&#039;s actually pretty expensive for a studio apartment. However it was renovated and required only 10% down and no board approval. <br /><br />

					Jackson Heights is a great area to live. I grew up in JH and loving it. And I have notice home prices has grow significantly. Of course it&#039;s a good thing for people who already own. But what about the local JH people who are looking to buy for the first time or to upgrade. Will they feel price out? For example, few of the 2bed/2bath elm court or Hawthorne Court are listed at 669k last fall. And then this year they&#039;re are listed at 745 and 749k. That&#039;s $80,000 in creased in just 6 months time. I guess all the news and pr are really helping the price grow and making new people want to move in to JH. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

It looks like the prices has increased almost double from the StreetEasy Record from 4.8 years ago. This is not the only 1 million co-op listing in JH. The first floor has another unit listed at $1,000,888. With all these listing prices, does this mean the Jackson Heights is changing with new people buying in ?

Linden court apartment looks spacious and nice, but why is the maintenance almost $1400? Seems high for a two bedroom/ one bath apartment?
