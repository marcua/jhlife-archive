				I thought maybe I was hallucinating when I heard the &quot;Pop Goes the Weasle&quot; jingle this evening. But no, I just observed an ice cream truck pull up to the curb outside my building. The guy inside handed a soft serve to a lady on the sidewalk. She handed him a bill, he handed her change. Neither was wearing a mask. No gloves. The f* is going on? How can people be so stupid and callous?

				I hate that truck. I am on the sixth floor and I can hear that stupid song crystal clear. And then he sits in one spot for 20 mins. I have a fantasy of shooting an arrow at the speaker on his truck.

				sounds like we have a lot of future Sullivan County residents here.<br /><br />and yes, masks should have been worn. but serving ice cream? we have 84 restaurants handing food to people on sidewalks, so who cares?

What I&#039;ve seen in Jackson Heights is people making an effort to stay safe and take care of their neighbors. Maybe that&#039;s why it&#039;s so jarring to see someone who clearly doesn&#039;t care that he could be spreading a deadly disease.<br />And no, it&#039;s not the same as the restaurants that are still open for takeout and delivery. They&#039;re taking precautions. They&#039;re not handling money and handing out food with their bare hands.<br />Oh well, nothing to do but call it in and keep on trying our best. Stay safe everyone.

				A soft-serve truck has been planted in front of Travers Park all week. Doesn&#039;t seem that much different than a Carvel store serving takeout to me, but I&#039;m not getting close enough to check their hygienic precautions.

				The truck is so annoying!&nbsp; As I am typing he is on 71st.&nbsp; Does the city have laws/rules in place with music from trucks?&nbsp; It has been on 71st for over 15 minutes with the music blaring.

				I live on 37th Ave and yes it is annoying because they&nbsp; keep the jingle going.&nbsp; At the other end people have no problem buying from the person.&nbsp; I figure with a few more million deaths the rents have to come down.
