				Hi All-<br />There are yoga classes offered at the MKD school of Karate in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Live In Vision Yoga, or LIV Yoga is a modern interpretation of Yoga that appeals to students who want a dynamic, creative approach to navigating the body, mind, and spirit.<br /><br />Each class has a specific sequencing principle that is unique to the group dynamic, time of day and season. Students are educated about their body and mind as they deepen their practice and become better acquainted with their self.<br /><br />Abigail acknowledges the uniqueness of each body and encourages students to do their best, always believing that practice is about oneâ€™s state of being. She takes pride in teaching her class as an &quot;all level&quot; class. She feels it is important to have beginners and new comers to the mat feel comfortable and secure. At the same time, she likes the ability to challenge more advanced students to take their practice to the next level.<br /><br />Her classes focus on helping students to practice with self awareness and proper alignment so that students develop a sense of strength, stability, ease and confidence.&nbsp; She is very dedicated to a holistic approach to well-being. Her vision is for her classes to serve as a valuable tool for improving quality of life, both in the studio and out.<br /><br />WHEN: Every Monday @ 7:00-8:00 PM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Classes begin and end on time.<br />WHERE: MKD School of Karate, 72-26 Roosevelt Ave, 2nd Flr, Jackson Heights NY 11372<br />DETAILS: $10 per class ($40 or $50 per month)<br />All levels and both genders most welcome!<br />The floor is matted. We recommend however that you bring your own mat. We have clean towels at your disposal, at no fee.
