					Hi Linda.<br />I don&#039;t know if my reply to your request reached you or not. so I&#039;ll say again that I would be happy to<br />be interviewed.&nbsp; I was born in Jackson Heights in 1942 and lived there until 1977.

					I am sorry to report the passing of Rod L. Ekstam, who departed this&nbsp; life at his home in Paducah. Kentucky on May 1, 2017.&nbsp; He was 75 years old and is survived by his wife, Marilyn Ekstam of Paducah.<br />Rod was my oldest friend. and we grew up in a Jackson Heiths that has all but faded from memory. I met Rod in the P.S. 69 schoolyard when we were both in the Third Grade.&nbsp; Our home room teacher was<br />a buck toothed hawk-nose old biddy named Mrs. McKey who was rumored to have hated boys--especially wise guys like us.&nbsp; &nbsp;We probably spent more time in the 69 schoolyard than the school itself,<br />but the schoolyard is where we parked ourselves all the way through high school graduation.&nbsp; I could write volumes about this one aspect of Jackson Heights Life, but the task is daunting.&nbsp; The point of putting words to paper now is to remember what a Jackson Heights boy rod was. Rod lived in Hampton Court, attended Community Methodist Church, dated girls from the Chateau -- and was pals with John Connolly. Charlie Berry, Nick Carter, Dick Garrett, Butch Speer and me, John Witek.&nbsp; Rod and I were rarely out of touch and one of the bonds that held us together was&nbsp; a mutual affection for &quot;the Heights&quot; as we called it, our dear old home town.&nbsp; How lucky we were to have been there in its golden age.

					He has been called one of the most influential music producers in history. He arranged music for or produced Peter Paul and Mary, John Denver, the Chad Mitchel Trio, and The Brothers Four.&nbsp; He was responsible for a huge string of hits in the 50s, 60s and 70s...but in 1955 he was a music teacher at JHS 145.&nbsp; His name is Milton (Milt) Okun and I rember him as a very nice man in a plaid shirt and horn rim glasses who played guitar for us and told us about his new record of sea chanties: Every Inch a Sailor.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anybody remember Mr. Okun ?

					<br />My memories of Christmas in Jackson Heights in the 40s and 50s are so many and so varied that I will just have to jump right in and ask you, dear reader, join in the festivities.<br /><br />The season began when the lights went up on 74th Street and 82nd&nbsp; Street. These were special lights strung across the our two main commercial streets and how glad we children were to see them.<br /><br />Gene Autry came out with Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer in 1949 and followed with Frosty The Snowman a year later.<br /><br />The Post Office became a hub of Christmas activity. You bought Christmas seals there and mailed your Christmas packages.<br /><br />At PS 69 we decorated our windows with artificial snow.&nbsp; Mr. Ball, the kindly old custodian played Santa Claus.&nbsp; At JHS 145, Mr. Adolph led us in song for a Christmas/Hanuka festival. I can remember the songs, but I still canâ€™t spell Hanuka.<br /><br />Most apartments in the neighborhood decorated their lobbies.&nbsp; The Greystones on 80th Street had a particularly impressive display of trees and lights. Every good old bar in the neighborhood put up decorations as well, and so did the liquor stores.<br /><br />Christmas trees went on sale in parking lots, street corners, and fruit stands.&nbsp; Douglas Fir Trees were the only trees available; there were no Scotch Pines or other exotic flora to be had.<br /><br />We had bubble lights.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve we filed into Community Church for candlelight service with Doctor Karl F. Moore.&nbsp; Every year he told the story of how he tried to photograph a candle for the cover of a church bulletin -- and how all the darkness in the world couldnâ€™t extinguish the light of that single candle.<br /><br />Saint Joan Of Arc had midnight mass, and services at Saint Markâ€™s Episcopal Church were conducted by Rev. L. Roper Shamhart.<br /><br />When the holidays were over we had huge Christmas tree bonfires in the vacant lots.&nbsp; I distinctly remember some kids chanting: &quot;Hitler&#039;s house is burning down,&quot; while the trees burned.<br /><br />Merry Christmas from yesteryear.&nbsp; Do you have Christmas memories to share?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					<br /><br />â€œSomeday Iâ€™m going to write a book about this place and call it â€˜The Yard.â€™â€&nbsp; &nbsp;So spoke my friend, Sid Daniels, talking about the P.S. 69 schoolyard in Jackson Heights, Queens.&nbsp; He said it over fifty years ago, and since no book on the subject has materialized, Iâ€™ll pinch hit for old Sid, wherever he may be. <br /><br />In the 1950s, the P.S. 69 schoolyard was an after-school oasis for kids who wanted to recreate, or socialize, or just hang out. This was before it was covered with asphalt to make it a safer place to play.&nbsp; We played on rock hard concrete peppered with pebbles that glittered like diamonds in the sun.&nbsp; Cuts, scrapes, and contusions that simply came with the territory.<br /><br />The Yard was a chain-link sanctuary that was open 24 hours a day. It had courts for handball and basketball, a brick wall for stickball, and just enough space for cramped, urban versions of baseball, softball, and touch football.&nbsp; Grownups rarely set foot in the Yard.&nbsp; One exception I can remember was a hoopster named Polachek who was there for so many years he outlasted every kid who played him for quarters, grew up, and moved on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then there was Joe the Cop.&nbsp; I never found out if he was a real cop or not, but I tend to doubt it given his fondness for playing poker with&nbsp; <br />juveniles.<br /><br />Left to our own devices, we found plenty to do in the old schoolyard. We played Chinese and American handball and box ball with pink rubber balls called â€œSpauldeens,â€ a corruption of â€œSpaulding.â€&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Stickball was big, too. You stood in front of&nbsp; a wall and swung a broomstick wrapped with&nbsp; black electricians tape and, if you really connected, the ball made an arc that seemed to double back on itself and was a beautiful sight to behold.<br /><br />We flipped baseball cards, read comic books, and rode bikes that clattered and buzzed with playing cards stuck in their spokes.&nbsp; In the summer we bought ash cans, cherry bombs, and lady fingers from older, harder kids who werenâ€™t afraid to stock up on illegal fireworks in Chinatown and Little Italy.<br />Moe &amp; Archieâ€™s provided sustenance. Fifteen cents bought you a giant pretzel and a bottle of Mission soda.&nbsp; <br /><br />There could be so much going on in the Yard that you had to constantly be on the lookout for people and objects in motion.&nbsp; On a busy Saturday the Yard could look like a modern version of Peter Breughelâ€™s Flemish Renaissance masterpiece called â€œChildrenâ€™s Games,â€ a painting crammed with Flemish Renaissance children entirely absorbed in their games and pastimes.<br /><br />Despite the high volume of kids the Yard supported, we coexisted in a way that would have made Rodney King proud.&nbsp; The hoodlums (we called them â€œrocksâ€) occupied the steps near the basketball court at the northeast corner of the Yard.&nbsp; Basically they just sat their smoking cigarettes and looking sour.&nbsp; My friends and I lolled around by the handball court to the southwest of the Yard -- and never the twain did meet. . . except once, one summer night. . . when a confrontation did occur and we discovered to our great satisfaction that the rocks werenâ€™t as hard, and we werenâ€™t as soft, as we thought we were.<br /><br />Where are they all now I wonder?&nbsp; The jocks like tall Paul Wladzarck who smacked into a pole going out for the pass and wound up in the hospital.<br />Fellow handball players Nick Carter, Bill Baglive, and Doc Simpson, and a guy named Milo who could beat us all.&nbsp; Big Aaron, at one time the only African-American who played in the Yard.&nbsp; Assorted tough guys: Donny LaRosa, Buster, Kevin Young and the Rubino brothers.&nbsp; And the kids who lived across the street:&nbsp; my friend Mike Tate who graduated Bronx Science High School at fifteen; curly headed Dennis Malpedi; Leo Gaumont who joined the Navy, and Michael Steinfeld who played the Cello.&nbsp; <br /><br />Memory comprehends them, and myself as well.&nbsp; For some persistent reason my thoughts will drift back to a fine Spring evening when itâ€˜s still light out at seven oâ€™clock , and privet blossoms scent the air, and I climb a low brick wall and look out across the Yard and there it all is -- that Breughel painting!&nbsp; <br /><br />Itâ€™s April.&nbsp; Iâ€˜m twelve again.&nbsp; And everything lies ahead.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					I remember Molly&#039;s candy store well, I lived right up the block on 75th Street.&nbsp; We called it &quot;Sam&#039;s&quot; I don&#039;t recall the name &quot;Lefty.&quot;&nbsp; Molly&#039;s was one of a number of &quot;candy&quot; stores in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; They had more or less the same layout -- newspapers, magazines, racing forms, comic books, cigars, cigarettes and candy up front; six or eight seat soda fountain in the back.&nbsp; Being a kid and having no money I would quench my thirst on hot afternoons with a two cents plain, which was straight seltzer that could also be had in a larger glass for a nickle.&nbsp; I bought comic books and bubble gum cards at Sam&#039;s that have long ago become high priced collector&#039;s items.&nbsp; There were other candy stores in the neighborhood including one near the Earle theater run by the Begun family and, of course, Moe &amp; Archie&#039;s which was a major oasis to we kids who hung out in the P.S. 69 school yard.<br /><br />My most vivid memory of Moe &amp; Archie&#039;s was a large cooler that held bottles of Mission sodas and Yoohoo (Yogi Berra&#039;s favorite chocolate drink). Early in the summer, management would stock the cooler with sodas and a big block of ice.&nbsp; As summer progressed, the ice would melt and the water would get dirtier and dirtier thanks to dozens of grubby little paws fishing for bottles of sickly sweet Cream Soda and Yoohoo.&nbsp; There were shards of broken glass in the murky water and more than one of us kids came away with bloody fingers.&nbsp; The cooler was a mess, but that didn&#039;t deter us. We were kids and dirt was no big deal.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					There were four great movie theaters in my Jackson Heights of yesteryear: The Earle, Colony, Jackson, and Boulevard.&nbsp; Each one of them had a distinct personality, and all of them figured in to <br />the way we grew up.&nbsp; The Earle was a perfect little art deco jewel box.&nbsp; It had the worst concession stand of the four, but it was only two blocks away from where I lived.&nbsp; On Summer Saturdays in&nbsp; the 1940s and 50s, the Earle and the Jackson and the Boulevard had kiddy matinees and for a quarter you got to see 15 color cartoons, a chapter of a serial, and a double feature that was likely to be a low budget western and a pirate picture.&nbsp; We kids were penned up in a kiddy section ruled by a grim, flashlight bearing matron in a nurse&#039;s costume. We could make all the noise we wanted, but running around and throwing things at the screen was out.&nbsp; The Boulevard was the most opulent of the neighborhood movie palaces.&nbsp; It was built in 1926 and was the only movie house that could double as a legitimate theater.&nbsp; Bela Lugosi played Count Dracula live on stage at the Boulevard. In the 1950s, it was the theater that ran most of the great horror and science fiction films such as The Curse of Frankenstein, The Incredible Shrinking Man, and The House On Haunted Hill.&nbsp; It was also the place to take your girl on a Saturday night because it had the best balcony for making out.&nbsp; The Jackson was a fine, big theater with a good concession stand and arena-like seating. I will always remember that it had a handsome bronze statue of Caesar Augustus in it&#039;s lobby.&nbsp; I saw The Third Man there, which remains my favorite movie to this day.&nbsp; The Colony on 82nd Street was tiny -- a little art house by today&#039;s standards.&nbsp; It had big framed blowups of movie stars like Clark Gable, and it was the theater we went to the least.&nbsp; I saw Gone With The Wind there in revival.&nbsp; The movie theaters in Jackson Heights witnessed our progressions from children, to teenagers, to young adults.&nbsp; They provided the darkness for the metamorphoses to occur, and I am grateful that they were were a backdrop for our transformations. What are your memories of these marvelous picture palaces?

					Absolutely right. Mary was his mother and I remember her on stage at the Boulevard conducting one of the children&#039;s programs. Do you still live in the Chateau?&nbsp; I had many friends who lived there, and I thought it was the most elegant building in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; What years did you attend Garden, if I may ask? Did you know the Johnson and Wiegand sisters, Dede Thompson, Tommy Rigg and Gary Nelson?

					Anyone out there remember my old pal, &quot;Gruff&quot;?&nbsp; That wasn&#039;t his name, of course, but we called him that because he was loud and overbearing.&nbsp; Fortunately, he had a great voice, an announcer&#039;s voice, so we listened to his bad jokes and goofy sayings without too much difficulty.&nbsp; &quot;Gruff&quot; passed away several years ago, and I was saddened to find no mention of it anywhere--hence this posting.&nbsp; His real name was Richard, and back when we were teenagers, the girls called him Uncle Dickie.&nbsp; His claim to fame? Except for a stint in the Army and time away at Boston College, he lived for most of his 69 years in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; He grew up in Hampton Court, got married and raised two kids in the Towers, and then moved back to Hampton Court until the end. Dick and I were part of a circle of friends who enjoyed the best of times in Jackson Heights in the late 50s and early 60s.&nbsp; We hung out in the P.S. 69 school yard and, frequented Maxel&#039;s, Harry Martin&#039;s, and The Rendezvous. We got to see all of the horror and science fiction films you could ever imagine at the Jackson and the Boulevard theaters , and we bounced back and forth between St Mark&#039;s and Community churches on the eternal quest for girls. On Saturday nights we danced to The Drifters and listened to the Kingston Trio at friends apartments in the Chateau. <br />In addition to Gruff, our crowd included guys named Rod, John, Charlie B., Tommy, Chas. and Garry (also known as Rippy). The girls were sisters Ann and Linda, Barbara and Erika, Inky, Lotte and sharp-witted Dede. We patronized Toddle House, Jahns, The White Castle on 69th Street and, when Herc from Astoria supplied the wheels, we&#039;d visit Kiddie City and Fairyland.&nbsp; To pay for it all I delivered liquor for Kurt Gugenheimer&#039;s 82nd Street Wines and Liquors and worked at a factory called Flour Mix. Dick had a summer job as a landscaper and helped keep the neighborhood&#039;s famous gardens in shape. To be sure, Dick probably saw more of old and new Jackson Heights than just about anyone I could imagine.&nbsp; If you knew him, your comments would be appreciated.

					The Blue Haven was located at the corner of 73rd Street and 37th Avenue. Lenny Bruce was there in 1947 when he was just starting out.&nbsp; The nightclub had a blue mirrored facade and a big circular bar, as did Dumbarton Oaks.&nbsp; Attached is a picture of the old place.&nbsp; And speaking of bars, who remembers The Orchid on 37th Avenue between 76th and 77th streets?

					It was somewhere on Northern Boulevard, I know that much.&nbsp; It&#039;s important because it belongs on the National Register Of Historic Places thanks to the father of the solid body electric guitar, Les Paul.&nbsp; On January 14, 1951 Paul and wife Mary Ford recorded &quot;How High The Moon&quot; in their home studio at the Two Pigs Meat Market using multitrack recording techniques that Paul had pioneered. <br />The song became a monster hit and multitracking became the standard approach for recording just about every kind of music thereafter. Rock &amp; Roll, Blues, Jazz, Gospel, Classical, you name it -- there&#039;s a little bit of Jackson Heights in all of them.

					As a product of New York City&#039;s public school system, I never knew what to make of the little prep school on 79th Street known as the Garden Country Day School.&nbsp; I passed it on a daily basis when I attended JHS 145.&nbsp; I dated girls who went there.&nbsp; But save for a few glimpses through the chain link fence that surrounded what is now known as the Garden School I hadn&#039;t a clue what went on there.&nbsp; I even have a Garden yearbook from 1945 called &quot;The Cupola&quot; that has pictures of the old place. . .but after all these years I still can&#039;t get a handle on it.&nbsp; Can any of you old Heightzers fill me in?&nbsp; Does anybody have any memories of Garden Country Day?

					Milt Okun was a fine teacher who had quite a life after 145. Here&#039;s what Wikipedia has to say: &quot;Milt Okun (born 23 December 1923 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American arranger and record producer best known as a member of The Belafonte Folk Singers with Harry Belafonte.<br /><br />Okun also recorded several albums of his own in the 1960s. Has made arrangements or produced for a large number of well-known artists such as Peter Paul and Mary, The Chad Mitchell Trio, The Brothers Four, and John Denver. In 1968 he interviewed many American folksingers and published the songs they chose in Something to Sing About! (New York: Macmillan Company).&quot;<br /><br />As far as I know he is still going strong.
