				I am passing along this information on behalf of some of my neighbors in the Greystones. We realize that many are going through great financial difficulties themselves at this time, but are appreciative of any support that can be given. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><strong>April 27, 2020<br /><br />Dear Neighbors and Friends,<br /><br />We are saddened to report that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit home, like it has for so many others across our beloved neighborhood, city and country. Our neighbor, Luis Barroso, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital via ambulance three weeks ago. Since that time, his wife and young daughter were unable to visit. And tragically, they were unable to say goodbye. Luis passed away last week, after weeks on life support.<br /><br />The family he leaves behind have been under strict quarantine since he was taken to the hospital. They were only able to get news of his passing through a nephew who worked with the Elmhurst doctors trying so hard to keep Luis alive.<br /><br />Luis’s wife lost her job at the start of the pandemic, after the city shut down non-essential businesses. They have not been able to see family, friends, or celebrate his life with their community. Our hearts break for them, and like many of you, we feel helpless.<br /><br />We recognize that these are uncertain financial times for all, but if you are able, please consider donating to the GoFundMe page <span class="bbc_u">here</span> (https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund). The funds we raise together will help pay for Luis’s cremation and the return of his remains to his birthplace in Ecuador. Even more urgently, your donation will help his wife and daughter navigate these unimaginable times.<br /><br />No donation is too small. Please be as generous as you can. If you are unable to support financially, do not underestimate the power of unexpected kindness—condolences in the form of cards can be sent to: <br /><br />The Barroso Family<br />35-21 80th Street, Apt. 21<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br /><br />Thank you for your kind thoughts, prayers, and contributions. Please don&#039;t hesitate to share this note and the GoFundMe page (<span class="bbc_u">https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund</span> (https://gofundme.com/f/luisbarrosomefund)) with your networks.<br /><br />With our deepest gratitude.</strong><br /><br /><hr /><br />Steven Tomkiewicz <br />on behalf of James Minor
