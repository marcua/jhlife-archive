They mostly do cakes and premade sandwiches and their coffee is quite good.

				I can attest, it’s actually very common in other parts of the world.<br /><br />I’ll say, though, didn’t LOVE the coffee here.

				I have been past this place and have gone in, what is their product?? Everything is basically showcases of over the top wedding decorations and such. No one in there, hardly any bakery products for such a huge place..maybe a front for something else?<br />

				Went today and was reaalllllly happy with my medianoche sandwich and cortadito. Really happy. I would DEFINITELY go back for this brownie they had and other luscious treats. I think they plan to make much money from wedding and other special occasion cakes. Cortadito was 1.75, btw, I love that.

The Cubano I ordered, while tasty, was served cold.&nbsp; :-\ That said, nothing my George Foreman grill couldn’t fix.

				was it cold because you got takeout? Maybe they only heat it up when you eat in? I don&#039;t like the non-chairs thing at all - the tables are too low for standing

Unfortunately, it was still fridge cold when I unwrapped it at home. I placed it on the grill for a few minutes, and it was pretty good.

				I walked by La Gran Via a short while ago and noticed that they’ve added seating. The tables are tall, so they opted for stools. The last time I ate there was during the cooler weather months, and I didn’t have anywhere to place my jacket. It was much too warm inside to wear while eating, so the stools help in the seating department, in addition to offering a spot to place a jacket/coat.
