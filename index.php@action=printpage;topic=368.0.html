				&nbsp;I remember the long line to get school supplies after 1st day of school at PS69!&nbsp; Had totally forgotten about that until now.&nbsp; It was fun at lunchtime from school.&nbsp; One day to get the 15 cents a slice pizza, 10 cent coke, right across the street.&nbsp; The next day, Hamburger Express, big expense $75cents to $1.00.&nbsp; Then the Jewish deli the next day for a hot dog and knish.&nbsp; Moe and Angelo&#039;s became Rajah&#039;s with the grumpy glasses guy&nbsp; &quot;leavealonethecomics, this isn&#039;t the library&quot; --- 50 cents covered a hamburger, french fries, and a coke.&nbsp; If there was time left, a walk to the toy store.&nbsp; I remember the boys that were traffic guards at lunch, as we raced across the street to get to the yard before the bell would ring.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a barber shop where the barber had a parrot.&nbsp; Also, I remember a lot of the kids in the neighborhood went to Dr. Gazune (not sure of spelling) an old doctor who scared the crap out of us!&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember Tottle house built, I think, towards the end of my days at PS69 and beginning of IS145..<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><em>[Note from Moderator:&nbsp; This discussion has been relocated to this thread from elsewhere.]</em></strong>

				It&#039;s been fun renewing the old memories of Jackson Heights. Just a few more from me.<br /><br />PS 69 in the 50&#039;s was run by the saintly Dr.Jaffe who as others have pointed out was Rona Jaffe&#039;s father. PS 69 in those days had a wonderful array of teachers. The ones I remember were Mrs.Tuckman, Mrs. Brock,Dr.Plover. Mr. Isby(more about him after the list) Miss Leddy and Miss Speary. There was also a music teacher who tried to teach violin overlooking the school yard at 3:30. An impossible task. That wall with the box with the big S in it said forget the violin lesson and play stickball.Her name was Miss Birdseye and I lasted maybe three lessons<br /><br />Mr. Isby I notice is shown in Jr. H.S.145 list. I&#039;m sure he taught at PS69. He could be very strict at times but we liked him anyway. He had a habit of throwing chalk or erasers at kids who were talking in class. I also remember him challenging the class to a race in the PS69 school yard for some reason that is lost in time.<br /><br />Mrs. Brock was a teacher whose husband was an FBI agent. He was killed in the line of duty. I thought for while that it was an urban myth but if you persevere you will find the sad story of Harry Brock on the internet.<br /><br />PS 69 had two annual events-the cake sale and the Bazaar. The cake sale was where parents would bake cookies and cakes and then sell them for the school&#039;s benefit. The Bazaar was where lots of things got sold again for the benefit of the school. <br /><br />The first friend I had in that school was Arthur Nadle who I remained friends with for over 50 years until his untimely passing some years ago.<br /><br />I suppose there&#039;s always the temptation to give these old recollections more of a shine than they deserve but it was a great old school with dedicated teachers and a wonderful atmosphere that I still recall with affection.

				The science teachjer with the Weird Al look:&nbsp; Mr. Donath.<br /><br /><br />I went to IS 145 from 79-82.&nbsp; Steinberg was principal, he had been at 69 with me until middle of my 5th grade.&nbsp; Back then, 145 had a metal mini building eventually done over with a dragon mural.<br /><br />Teachers:&nbsp; Mr Heckler for 6th grade French, Mr Davies 6th grade science, Ms Grima, math, Ms Franzoni was math too --- horrible teacher, I was on math team, a genius in math, and she gave me a 65 for attitude.&nbsp; Carothers was indeed band.&nbsp; Ms Mayo was my very patient asst principal (the asst principal went up each grade with the kids), and I was in her office A LOT!&nbsp; McAuley and Siskind, both locals, were Social Studies, Mr Martinez was the tyrant who taught me Spanish.&nbsp; I also had Isby for Science, but in 69 I had him AFTERS CHOOL at the SPACE program at 145, maybe that&#039;s why people think he taught elementary.&nbsp; Burned my fingers on a bunsen burner in SPACE, so he always remembered me.<br /><br />In 69, I only went two years (prior I was Garden grades 1 thru 3 .. all I remember there was a mean 3rd teacher named Eluto and a decent one named W-something who hated me because I did all my workbooks all by the second week), but I was a terror in 69 so I recall Steinberg quite well.&nbsp; I had Ms Lutin in 4th grade, and Mr Lastoria in 5th.&nbsp; Hew as definitely in the wrong field:&nbsp; &nbsp;he tossed chalk, and made one racially insenstive comment that haunted our class for years.<br /><br />High school I went to Science, so no Heights memories there.&nbsp; (Did start my career in special ed though as a counselor at a summer program in McClancy called operation FUN ... )<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=64.msg9904.html#msg9904">Quote from: sl on August 12, 2008, 11:44:44 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IS 145 (around 83 - 85)<br /><br />Mr Hare - Science<br />Mr Sharma - Math<br />Mr Bongino- Dean<br />Ms McFadden - Language Arts, i think<br />Mr Isby - Science<br />Mr Kostakis - History<br />Ms Rodriguez - French<br />Ms Carther - Band<br />Mr Johnson - English / homeroom<br />Ms Cornfeld - Math<br />Some science teacher that looks like weird AL (forgot his name)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<br />Does anyone know when and why Joseph Pulitzer Junior High School 145 became the utterly awful and anonymous IS145. I have been an ex-pat for years so I haven&#039;t lived through these changes. <br /><br />I hope there was some plausible reason to remove old Pulitzer&#039;s name from the title although I honestly can&#039;t think of anything that would justify this act of municipal vandalism.&nbsp;

				Just a very quick follow up to my meanderings about JHS145. <br /><br />There was a school song sung to the tune of the Woody Guthrie classic &quot; This land is my land&quot;<br /><br />The words were: This school is my school, this school is your school-our Junior High School 145- We&#039;ll sing it loudly ,we&#039;ll sing it proudly- THIS SCHOOL WAS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.<br /><br />Now is where it gets hazy- something, something &quot;our happy school days will fade away but we will something something &quot;remember fondly this school was made for you and me&quot;<br /><br />Anyone out there remember the full verse?and is it still sung? Although not I hope with the dead weight of the IS145 name.

				Anyone on this board attended Garden School Circa late 1960&#039;s up to mid 1970&#039;s?&nbsp; Although many of my friends went to Bryant and Newtown, after I attended IS145 the first year they had 6th grade, my parents were irritated with the public schools and made me attend private.&nbsp; While I had some happy memories, looking back, I think I would have preferred a larger less elitist high school.&nbsp; Today, many of my friends have attended huge high school reunions.&nbsp; Because Garden was so small, there have been no orginized reunions to speak of since the early 1980&#039;s.&nbsp; I feel that I missed out.....Anita

				I don&#039;t know how I bumped into to this site but it has revived memories from a long time ago. I lived in Jackson Heights in the sixties and went to PS 69 and afterwards attended JP Junior High School 145. My family moved away from the US in 1968, one year before finishing Junior High School and I never returned since. I had some very good friends there,I especially remember one classmate named Eric who lent me a book that he had borrowed from the local library. A few days before we moved out from the neighborhood, he asked me to return the book to him and I told him not to worry, I would make sure it got back to the library. We were going to fly out of the country but my father would be staying on for a few months before joining us. I asked him to make sure the book got returned to the library but I found out later that my dad had forgoten to return the book and it had been left behind at the furnished apartment that used to be our home. It might sound stupid but during these past 40 years I have often thought about the friendship I betrayed back then&nbsp; by not returning the book. Funny how our school memories from those tender years are so vivid, ever more so as we grow old. I remember our science teacher Mr. Davis or Davies a wonderfull man and I noticed that several people mentioned him here in their comments. I also remember being punished and threatened with expulsion when I made a spitball which was ejected by means of a straw and aimed at one of my classmates during lunch hour in the cafeteria. You can imagine my horror when I saw my target ducking at just the right moment, and my spitball flying over his head and hitting in the forehead my gym teacher. She was looking straight at me as I froze with that straw in my mouth.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Wow, it&#039;s great to know Mrs. Lutin loved us, because I was sure I drove her nuts!<br /><br />I was about 2 years younger than my classmates, and that was my first year in public school after three years at Garden School (paid for in part by some gifted kid thing at Hofstra ... I apparently was smart but very busy and somewhat behavioral), and Mrs. Lutin definitely had her hands full with a 7-year old 4th-grader with no off button.<br />But because of her, and Mr. Steinberg the principal, I really got ready for the world more than my 3 years of school before that.<br /><br />I would love to talk to you more about it, either via PM or email (really4rob@aol.com, or really4rob@yahoo.com).&nbsp; Also, if you&#039;re on facebook, I posted a picture of the 4th grade class ... in fact, one classmate in the picture is Lucy Liu, the actress.&nbsp; Unsure if your mom realized she had taught some famous folk ...

				Well, some searching on facebook led to me the then-assistant principal Mr Sandler, who apparently became principal after Mr Steinberg soon after I left 145.&nbsp; Sadly, both Mr Steinberg and assistant principal Ms Mayo from 145 have passed away as well, years ago in fact.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame that great educators, like Ms Lutin and administrators, Mr Steinberg, etc. get lost in the sands of time as there was no insideschools.org to rave about them on twenty and thirty years ago.
