				This fall, a new magazine will launch dedicated to the food of Queens:<br /><br />From the website (http://www.ediblecommunities.com/queens):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>edible Queens</em> is a quarterly print magazine committed to bringing you the latest information on the incredible foods available locally in the county of Queens, New York. Weâ€™re a sister publication to edible Brooklyn and edible Manhattan, and a proud member of a national network of more than 50 local foods publications called Edible Communities. <br /><br />In each issue, youâ€™ll meet the people of Queens who strive each and every day to please your palate. The street vendors who rise before dawn to stock their carts with the freshest halal meat. The restaurant chefs and home cooks who honor their heritage by serving authentic meals, every dish a reflection of who they are and where they came from. The butchers, fishmongers, spice merchants and bakers who insist on the highest quality. Youâ€™ll also meet the visionaries: the men and women who are changing the way New Yorkers eat by teaching us, bite by bite, where our food comes from, and why that matters.</span></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />More info at Pinot and Prose (http://pinotandprose.blogspot.com/2009/05/taking-local-eating-to-next-level.html).

				I&#039;m impressed that such a magazine exists!&nbsp; $28 for four issues is a bit steep, though.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to peruse a copy before committing- think they&#039;ll sell them in the usual bookstores?&nbsp; Maybe we could ask Espresso 77 to stock a few copies when the first issue comes out?

				Wondering if these are free promotional copies that are made available to these businesses, and if so, will that be long term? &nbsp;I&#039;m doubting that. &nbsp;This is after all, the premiere issue.

				I just picked up a copy during lunch at the Institute for Culinary Education at 50 West 23rd street (5th floor). They had a small stack of copies at the front desk.<br /><br />It was a bit thinner and less glossy than I had anticipated. Still, it seems very promising.

				new article about <strong>Edible Queens</strong><br /><br /><strong>Hey, we&#039;re tasty, too, sez editor of new food mag</strong><br />BY Clare Trapasso <br />Tuesday, December 1st 2009<br /><br />FOOD lovers can look forward to an early Christmas gift. <br /><br />A new quarterly magazine, <strong>Edible Queens</strong>, chronicles the borough&#039;s thriving food scene. And its creator hopes it will help put the borough on the map as a food destination on a par with Manhattan and Brooklyn. <br /><br />&quot;People in New York ignore Queens,&quot; said editor, publisher and food lover Leah McLaughlin. But, she added, &quot;I actually think there&#039;s a lot more passion and emotion in the food in Queens.&quot; <br /><br />The second issue is to be published Dec. 16. <br /><br />McLaughlin said she rarely ventured into Queens, except occasionally to Jackson Heights for spices, until she moved to Long Island City about three years ago. <br /><br />&quot;The minute I moved into Queens, the city opened up again,&quot; McLaughlin said. &quot;What makes Queens food special are the people that prepare it. They&#039;re much more concerned with paying homage to where they come from.&quot; <br /><br />She decided in January to launch the magazine, three months before she lost her job as an editor at Prevention magazine, she said. <br /><br />She had heard of Edible Communities, a national network of about 60 magazines - including Edible Manhattan and Edible Brooklyn - that helps editors set up their own publications, and believed it was a good fit. <br /><br />In September, she distributed 20,000 copies of her free first issue to borough restaurants and businesses. It was such a success that McLaughlin hopes to eventually double the number of copies printed. <br /><br />The winter edition will feature stories that include a culinary shopping tour of Astoria, how to make the perfect cup of coffee and recipes for Lunar New Year. <br /><br />McLaughlin said she&#039;d also like to start supper clubs in Astoria, Flushing and Corona. She envisions them as get-togethers where local celebrities or historians talk about the local culture and history and how that ties into the area&#039;s food. <br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/12/01/2009-12-01_hey_were_tasty_too_sez_editor_of_new_food_mag.html#ixzz0Ysxn3cB9<br />

				A story about Edible Queens, with a special mention of Jeffsayyes and his Jackson Heights Food Group<br /><br />New Mag Eyes Queens Cuisine &nbsp;(http://www.yournabe.com/articles/2010/01/15/queens/queensbnuudwg01152010.txt)<br /><br /><strong>New mag eyes Queens cuisine scene<br />Edible Queens chronicles boroughâ€™s restaurant bounty quarterly</strong><br /><br />By Anna Gustafson<br />Friday, January 15, 2010 2:12 PM EST<br />&nbsp;<br />Leah McLaughlin runs Edible Queens, a magazine about food in the borough, from her Long Island City office. Photo by Christina Santucci <br />When Long Island City resident Leah McLaughlin moved to Queens 3 1/2 years ago, she was amazed by the diversity of restaurants â€” not to mention the population â€” and decided her new home borough was the city experience for which many search.<br /><br />â€œIt really just opened up a whole new world to me,â€ McLaughlin said of the borough. â€œQueens is the New York that people move here thinking Manhattan will be. Itâ€™s so diverse.â€<br /><br />She began to explore the borough for food, going to the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Spicy Mina in Woodside and Egyptian food joints in Astoria. Though the options seemed endless, when McLaughlin tried to search for publications solely focused on the boroughâ€™s cuisine, she came up empty-handed.<br /><br />â€œI looked around Queens, and I didnâ€™t see anyone doing this and thought how bizarre this borough thatâ€™s so food-oriented doesnâ€™t have this voice,â€ she said.<br /><br />So, taking matters into her own hands, McLaughlin decided to leave a longtime career in publishing and begin her own magazine devoted to covering food in Queens. She now owns Edible Queens, a free quarterly publication that launched in September and just published its second issue this winter.<br /><br />â€œSo many people have been coming out of the woodwork to tell us do this or go here, and thatâ€™s great for the magazine,â€ McLaughlin said. â€œThereâ€™s a huge amount of borough pride, but not many people had paid attention to us. Now we have a cool, hip, authoritative place to congregate and talk about where to eat.â€<br /><br />Thanks to her former life in the Manhattan publishing world, McLaughlin knows a thing or two about how to create a brand and she is doing much more than focusing only on creating the magazine â€” though that is a full-time job in and of itself. She recently asked Rego Park resident Joe DiStefano to head Edible Queensâ€™ blog, Worldâ€™s Fare, <strong>which has been noticed by foodies like Woodside resident Jeff Orlick.<br /><br />Orlick is the founder of the Jackson Heights Food Group, an organization that meets monthly to try different restaurants in western Queens.</strong><br /><br />Click link at top for rest of article.

				I have no idea why they mentioned me like that. It&#039;s funny that<em> I </em>would give edible queens some credibility and not the other way around. They just qualified me as a foodie.... <br />this was the same reporter from the taco tour though. so I guess she knew me. I am pretty sure this is in the queens times ledger.
