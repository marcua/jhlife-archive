			I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t enjoy your meal at La Fusta.&nbsp; When you say the meat was so so oily, was it greasier than other skirt steaks or other steaks (sirloin, filet, etc.) in general?&nbsp; Skirt steaks naturally have a very high fat content which gives it the flavor and &quot;greasiness&quot;.&nbsp; If it weren&#039;t for the fat, the meat would be way too chewy for humans.<br /><br />I always order the salad with the dressing on the side so that I can control its portion.<br /><br />The Argentinean cuisine is definitely strongly influenced by the Italians, as well as the Spanish, other Europeans, and native Indians.&nbsp; They may not be as good in terms of pasta, wine and cheese, but they&#039;ve one-upped the Italians in terms of steaks and meat.

			Yes, I&#039;ve eaten skirt steak before and it is noticeably greasier than other cuts, but this seemed more so. Now maybe I&#039;m being unfair and don&#039;t know enough about this cut of meat to pass fair judgement. Often when I eat skirt steak it is thinly sliced and so may not seem as greasy or oily than when in a large portion like La Fusta&#039;s.<br />I did eat every bite of my steak however, as did the other 2 skirt steak eaters.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely go back, the reviews are so consistently positive about the place and that menu is so extensive it is worth more attention. Even my very favorite restaurants will leave me less than inspired time and again.

			It may have been an off day.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had their skirt steak more than 10 times and 9 out of 10 have been great.
