				I am sure there are lifelong jackson heights residents on here. I can only remember as far back as the late 70&#039;s. Somebody asked this question on another forum.<br /><br />&quot;I remember a depot on the south side of Northern Blvd around 77th street that served the #15 route (possibly split with a Manhattan Depot) ant the #16 route. I believe that the building carried on as a car dealership (Plymouth ?) into the 1970&#039;s if not later.&quot;<br /><br />If anybody knows anything about this, please let me know, thanks.

				There was a bus depot on the south side of Northern Blvd between 76th and 77th Streets. My family lived across the street. I remember being awakened by the sounds of dozens of buses revving their engines when I was a child. <br /><br />Later there was a Peugeot car dealership on the same site. Years later the Queens County Bank took over the space.<br /><br />And I too, mourned the loss of Northern Lanes on 75th St. I was a child when they were building it - I remember the construction - our house was right behind the parking lot. When I was a teenager I hung out there practically full time. Good times. We even had a Northern Lanes softball team sponsored by Mickey, the concession owner.

				I went to JHS 145 with a kid named Steven Kaye in the mid 1960&#039;s. &nbsp;Somewhere in the back of my mind I remember that his family either owned or managed Northern Lanes.
