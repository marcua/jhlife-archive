					Jackson Heights desperately needs a good gym.&nbsp; EFN may be cheap, but most of the machines and their TVs are broken and it&#039;s so crowded that it&#039;s hard to even get a machine to use during peak hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to start a campaign to try and convince NYSC or any other chain to open up a gym.&nbsp; Actually, I don&#039;t really care if it&#039;s a chain or well-known gym, I just want a relatively clean gym with machines that work.<br /><br />There used to be Gladiator Health Club on Northern Blvd. b/t 82nd and 83rd Street but that closed down about 2 years ago, and the space is still empty.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that someone will reopen a gym there and put some new machines in.&nbsp; The address was 82-24 Northern Blvd.<br /><br />So, if you would like another gym in Jackson Heights to open, then please join my campaign and email some of the major chains like NYSC and ask them to bring a gym to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &nbsp;Follow this link and send them an email. <br /><a href="https://www.mysportsclubs.com/feedback.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.mysportsclubs.com/feedback.htm</a><br />&nbsp;<br />You can also become a fan of my facebook page: Jackson Heights 11372 needs a nice gym!!!!<br /><br />

					As a current board member I would like to share my opinion with you.&nbsp; I agree that an additional tax assessment on top of a recent 5% maintenance increase was ill-timed, however, there is a very short window of time when you can assess back the tax abatement, which is what your building is doing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, new owners like yourself do not qualify for the tax abatement and therefore have to pay the full assessment out of pocket, but there is nothing that can be done about that because the assessment has to be applied equally across all shareholders. (please remember that this assessment is not really a tax assessment but rather an normal assessment timed to coincide with the tax abatement in order to limit the financial impact on shareholders).&nbsp; In cases like yours, if it is a real financial burden, I would suggest that you ask for the assessment to be broken up into a few payments.&nbsp; We are currently assessing back an amount equivalent to the general tax abatement that our coop received, however we have divided it up over 5 months, so it is only an additional $20-40 dollars a month, depending on the number of shares owned.&nbsp; I think that most buildings in this neighborhood assess back the tax abatement in order to cover general operating expenses or to put towards a much needed capital improvement project.&nbsp; In our buildings we are putting the money towards the operating costs as a way to defer a much needed maintenance increase that we are trying to hold off implementing.&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that the members of your board are not out to get you or any other new owners. On the contrary, they are trying to keep your building afloat and in the black.&nbsp; They have a financial obligation to do what is best for the corporation and all of the shareholders and you should also keep in mind that they are paying the exact same maintenance increase and assessment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Without knowing what coop you are in and without seeing the books for your coop I can not give completely accurate advice, however, I can tell you that 40,000-60,000 dollars is nothing for a coop and that the cost of a minor elevator repair, garbage compactors, leaks on the&nbsp; roof, etc... would eat up that extra money immediately!&nbsp; It is incredibly expensive to properly operate and maintain a coop and a coop that does not have a very large reserve will always need to assess back tax abatements and apply other assessments just to keep the buildings afloat.&nbsp; <br />As cumbersome and unfair as these as assessments seem, the coop board is just trying to do what is in the best interest of the building(s).&nbsp; If the buildings are not fiscally sound then your property values will drop and everyone will have a hard time selling their apartments.&nbsp; <br /><br />In conclusion, I agree with the other poster who said if you don&#039;t like it, then run for the board.&nbsp; Although I think that once on the board you will see that it is not so black and white and you will see what a thankless and burdensome job it is to be on the board.<br /><br />Best of luck and welcome to the Jackson Heights!
