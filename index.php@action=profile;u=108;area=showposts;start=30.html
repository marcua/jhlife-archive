					I just wanted to say thanks, Todd, for posting the info about the electronics recycling event, which I wouldn&#039;t have seen otherwise.&nbsp; We had a pile of old electronics we&#039;ve been waiting to recycle, so it was great to to get rid of them (and the drop-off was super well-organized).&nbsp; We even then got to go for a run in a park that was new to us in an area of Queens that was new to us!&nbsp; I now want to go back to Cunningham Park in the summer to explore some of the wooded areas.

					Thanks, Jenn, for the Hall of Science info, and thanks, Todd, for the farmer&#039;s list!!<br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t have been so down on the market a few posts above - I&#039;m super grateful for the greenmarket we have, just wish it could be even better!&nbsp; I think I was just super disappointed that the farmer with peaches last summer had very sad peaches and the farmer with corn had very sad corn, and those are two things I spend all year looking forward to having.&nbsp; Peaches, corn, and tomatoes - three of my favorite foods and three things I basically only eat in season fresh from a local farm.<br /><br />As far as comparative prices&nbsp; at different greenmarkets, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s an element of what the market will bear.&nbsp; On the other hand, the prices for comparable items don&#039;t seem so different to me here than, say, Union Square - but there are a lot more expensive options at Union Square.&nbsp; Even there, different vendors will vary greatly in price, sometimes because the produce is grown differently with different care or similar items are actually different varieties, and sometimes for no reason that I can tell except that some people don&#039;t pay attention to the prices . . .

					Don&#039;t worry - I&#039;m sure there will be more vendors eventually (although I don&#039;t think any of them are farmers who have greenhouse/hothouse tomatoes, which is all you&#039;d get at this time of year - it&#039;s a while yet (5-6 weeks maybe?) until even the earliest South Jersey field tomatoes will be ripe and my memory of the farmers we had last year was that most of them were Hudson Valley.).&nbsp; As farmers have more produce, more of them will show up and have more tables every week.<br /><br />I will say that although the quantity of vendors will go up, I was disappointed weekly last summer with the quality of produce -fine for things like cucumbers or lettuce but corn, peaches, tomatoes, etc. were all pretty sad.&nbsp; I ended up still shlepping home produce from various Manhattan greenmarkets every week.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t understand why the JH greenmarket has such sad produce compared to even other small greenmarkets around the city.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been dying to check out Sunnyside&#039;s Sat greenmarket since I&#039;ve read that they have a fishmonger there now!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d love to get line-caught local fish without going to Manhattan or out the East End.<br /><br />Anyone know if the NY Hall of Science will have a farmer&#039;s market again?&nbsp; I only made it there the final weekend last fall when all that was left was one lone stand with apples - luckily that was all I needed as I was in search of apples for pie!&nbsp; Did anyone go there earlier in the season?&nbsp; Worth it?

					I&#039;ve had the folks at Zabb warn me from dishes plenty of times - but never bat an eye when I insist that I know what I&#039;m getting (even if I don&#039;t!) and order them anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;m thrilled that places like Zabb, Chao, and Sripriphai don&#039;t dumb down their flavors for non-Thais automatically.<br /><br />The best things at Zabb are usually the &quot;salads&quot; (I use quotation marks because they&#039;re not what we think of as salads).&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried a few other things - noodles, entrees, curries, apps - and they&#039;ve been fine, but not fantastic like all the salads are.<br /><br />And, speaking of Ethiopian food, it&#039;s been almost a year since I&#039;ve been there, but the best Ethiopian I&#039;ve found in Manhattan is at Meskel in the E Village.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting ready for a trip to Ethiopia late summer, so yt28, I wonder if (not in this thread), you&#039;d be willing to share any advice you have?

					I&#039;ve gotten some great fish at really reasonable prices from Sea Tide.&nbsp; The one caveat is that not everything looks great on any given day, so you have to go with what looks fresh rather than assuming you&#039;ll be able to find anything you want.&nbsp; However, there have always been a variety that look good so I&#039;ve always left happy.&nbsp; I also got great shrimp with the heads on at least once which were fantastic (shrimp w/heads=very very fresh b/c the heads spoil very quickly).<br /><br />I also really like Marino&#039;s in Astoria, but Sea Tide is more convenient, as I can walk to it or take the 7.

					In every forum, listserv, other online community I&#039;ve been part of (in many different contexts), there&#039;s always a struggle over how much moderation is necessary - from a heavy hand that keeps the community seemingly polite and mission focused on the surface but with tensions broiling underneath to almost no moderation which often leads to an utter breakdown.&nbsp; Despite the reminders in the rules and guidelines that we aren&#039;t necessarily strangers to each other - though who really knows whose posting here, right? - we ARE all going to act differently online than we would in a community meeting.&nbsp; Just the facts of online life.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s ever one right answer on the moderation question even for any single online community.&nbsp; I will say that the one thing that seems to be constant is that there are the fewest disagreements over moderation when it&#039;s very clear what the guidelines are, who gets to put them into place, and who gets to police them.&nbsp; Fewer, but they never end.<br /><br /><strong>I&#039;m incredibly grateful to the three of you who are giving your time and money to make this work for the rest of us!</strong>&nbsp; And, I&#039;m grateful that you seem to be doing it in a thoughtful manner and looking for input in making decisions.<br /><br />I keep just using the vague word moderation because I&#039;m not sure that I agree with the terms you used to describe potential problems with these particular threads (free speech vs privacy).&nbsp; I did not contribute to those threads (though I continued to read them), because I did find them a bit strange.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find them off-putting enough, though, to say so publicly on the threads, even in a non-judgmental - hey I was reading them!! - and polite way.&nbsp; Perhaps as the site matures, those who turn into old-timers (in internet time) will get more used to self-policing and help direct threads.<br /><br />In this case, it seems that rather than delete the threads, it might have been wiser for someone - possibly a moderator whether in his/her personal voice or as a forum leader - to step in and start a discussion about the wisdom of those threads.&nbsp; For the record - unless there are posts that were deleted or that I missed - I agree with NYCMacUser that the posts didn&#039;t seem to cross any lines into what could have been ugly subjects.&nbsp; I guess I did in some way find them a bit odd, though not quite distasteful, but the discussion of individuals&#039; public selves does not in itself seem to violate their privacy.&nbsp; Do I agree with your characterization that despite good intentions, the effect may have been intimidating and isolating?&nbsp; Yes, in fact.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t think that meant that they should be deleted.<br /><br />[And as we&#039;ve already seen, especially in our community, ANY topic very quickly can end up with all sorts of overtones about socio-economic class, country of origin, race, and ethnicity.&nbsp; These can be both productive and interesting parts of community building and divisive.&nbsp; I hope we are able to continue to engage these issues in good constructive ways.]<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this all is related to other questions that have already come up about complaints (and praise?) for those doing business in our neighborhood.&nbsp; You say that not every post is read/moderated.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t see how you&#039;ll be able to successfully balance that desire for a fairly open forum and keep discussion away from individuals&#039; behavior and/or motivation.&nbsp; When do you lay down the law amongst &quot;Store Y has great z for sale;&quot; &quot;there&#039;s one person working at Store Y who will go out of his/her way in x and y fashion for you;&quot; &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y because s/he won&#039;t do x or y;&quot; and &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y who won&#039;t do x or y for you because person Z is lazy and is also trying to put his/her boss out of business so his/her cousin can buy the store cheaply.&quot;&nbsp; Everything but the first sentence talks about someone&#039;s behavior and motivation.&nbsp; [ok - weird example on my part, but I&#039;m not going to spend the time to come up with another one.]&nbsp; I&#039;ve quite happily participated in heavily moderated forums, and am happy to do so here, but that takes a LOT of work by the moderators because self-policing does NOT cut it.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s bad precedent to have rules that are therefore constantly broken.<br /><br />I think the current rules and guidelines are quite good.&nbsp; Would you consider doing two things though?&nbsp; One - in addition to the link at the top of the page, maybe pin a link to them on every board since that tends to be more in our line of site as a reminder to check the rules than it would be as it is posted now.&nbsp; And, if the founders/moderators feel comfortable, would you add a second post to the rules laying out who started this site, who has moderation power, whether that rotates ever, how to complain about a post, even who is paying the server bill, etc.&nbsp; The rules go in and out of talking as if everyone registered wrote them and an &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp; I did write &quot;you&quot; a lot in the paragraph above.&nbsp; At least as long as the site is still young, it&#039;s clearly someone else&#039;s (or rather several someones) site that I&#039;m participating in, not my site.&nbsp; Which is cool with me - I didn&#039;t put this party together - and maybe it&#039;s your intention is to change that balance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m really thankful for the dedication already to transparency; I&#039;d love to see that go further and continue.

					While waiting for a community-wide effort on reducing plastic bags, I recently bought a baggu bag - baggubag.com - which is great.&nbsp; It lives in my purse so I always have it with me.&nbsp; I find I use it almost once a day, sometimes more.&nbsp; Sort of astonishing how often I use it, in fact!

					I&#039;m a DiFara&#039;s fan.&nbsp; Once made my parents drive there from LI to meet me there for my birthday - on a 95 degree weather day - and he doesn&#039;t have a/c - and we had to wait about an hour for our 2 pies!&nbsp; Luckily we had wine with us.&nbsp; I was *very* lucky the first time I went in that I was with a crowd that included one of the few people who have ever managed to make friends with Dom and he made us several pies and this massive calzone-like thing . . . one of the best meals of my life.<br /><br />But, really, you have to know yourself - if you&#039;re willing to go somewhere that&#039;s a trip for you - and possibly wait a long time - in a place that&#039;s no more comfortable than any other storefront slice shop - and where there&#039;s no system to when you might get your food - than, yes, it is the best pizza I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; But you have to just accept all that, therefore the endless debates on C&#039;hound year after year about it (and people being disappointed that after all that, it&#039;s just pizza though, to me, amazing pizza).<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine just going for a slice all the way from JH.&nbsp; I&#039;d only go with a couple of people - get one round and one square (they&#039;re different and both delicious) with one or no toppings, bring a bottle of wine (and an opener - though maybe after he got shut down by the DOH a year or so ago he&#039;s less willing to turn a blind eye to drinking??).&nbsp; Some people colonize a table, one person stays near the counter so you have a prayer of getting your pizzas.&nbsp; Bring home the leftovers.<br /><br />Damn.&nbsp; Got to get back there!

					Funny that I came from Manhattan to eat at Upi Jaya several times, and haven&#039;t been back since I moved to Jackson Heights!&nbsp; I used to love it - there was gossip on Chowhound over a year ago about some family problems with the implication that the food was perhaps suffering.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard from anyone who&#039;s been there recently, though.<br /><br />Is Padang Jaya the same as Mie Jakarta?&nbsp; I had fabulous fried chicken and fried fish at Mie Jakarta once.
