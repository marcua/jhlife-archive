				Not tai chi but there is a yoga/qigong class at Integral Yoga Institute every Thursday at 5:15.&nbsp; It is an hour and 30 minute class.&nbsp; Cost is $17 or $10 for seniors.&nbsp; I have been taking their yoga classes for years and highly recommend them.<br />They are located on W. 13 Street between 7th &amp; 8th Avenues. Have not yet tried the qigong.

				Kate would like to know if anyone or everyone would like to do a meet-up at one of the local coffee shops and discuss whether there&#039;s enough interest for a group class or if individual instruction would be the way to go. Or just if you have any questions. Espresso 77 is closing for renovation, but there&#039;s Juju&#039;s at one end (76th &amp; 37th) or Addictive at another (87th &amp; Northern) or if anyone has a suggestion anywhere in between.<br />As for qualifications, Kate has been practicing Yang style Tai Chi since 1996 and has been teaching, both classes at a school in Manhattan and privately in home, for the last 14 years. <br /><br />Just by way of caveat, Kate stresses that what she teaches is <strong>not</strong> a &quot;follow along&quot; class. You don&#039;t show up and do what the teacher in front of the class does. She will teach you the form, a few moves at a time, building a foundation that moves forward in a progressive manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;She does not teach a &quot;senior&quot; version but teaches to each individual&#039;s ability and range of movement.<br /><br />
