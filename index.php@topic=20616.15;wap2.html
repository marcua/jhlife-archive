			New bakeries...just what we need! Seriously, how does anyone stave off diabetes and heart disease around here? Temptations everywhere.

			First world problem?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Well better than another chain or a bank. There&#039;s a steam table in the back, so it&#039;s good for lunch/dinner too.

			I heard it was same owners as la Abunduncia. This is totally unconfirmed and this is just a message board so i don&#039;t feel so bad spreading hearsay. Can anyone confirm?

			Yes, same owner as La Abundancia across the street. I met the owner - he invited me to hang two of my photos (one in each of the two businesses), as part of my current exhibition &quot;Queens People Eating&quot;.
