That&#039;s awful. That&#039;s just too many people crammed into that neighborhood. The crowding on the subways and everywhere else will be horrendous. The City really does not give a damn about the strains put on the infrastructure when these huge towers are allowed to proliferate.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_71275">Though it may seem counter-intuitive, neighborhoods of towers often house less people than those chocked with apartment buildings.&nbsp; These maps might illustrate that:&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=80f9b95a4ce0491091f1477710f6a91d" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=80f9b95a4ce0491091f1477710f6a91d</a><br /><a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/m_pl_p2_nta.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/nyc-population/census2010/m_pl_p2_nta.pdf</a><br /><br />A Jane Jacobs acolyte, I think that area will benefit from housing more people: streets can be safer and retail infrastructure can mature.&nbsp; In the same vein, I am not a big fan of the aesthetics of the development.&nbsp; Towers are so remote and impersonal, I&#039;d prefer something more on a human scale, densely populated and low rise.&nbsp; I reckon that the economics of the developers favor the former rather than the latter.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do agree with your concerns about transportation infrastructure, but we also need to increase the supply of housing and that underpopulated area is a place ripe for it.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

I&#039;m sure I have no <em>idea</em> of everything that&#039;s affected by dumping a ton of people on a neighborhood, but schools come to mind. And parking, and even the sidewalks and streets, which are not going to get wider! I have friends who&#039;ve lived in Williamsburg since the &#039;90s, and the increase in sidewalk crowding and traffic has been dramatic in the past ten years—I see it when I go visit them. They don&#039;t have kids so I haven&#039;t gotten any details about how the schools have been affected. But I&#039;ll ask them about other issues that have arisen (that is, aside from the constant noise and the property damage that they endured for over three years while the condo next door was being built).<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying there should be no development. But what&#039;s happened in Williamsburg is the result of relatively low-rise development. I can only imagine what LIC will be like with all that high-rise development. I&#039;m with you about the aesthetics, and I totally agree that low-rise development on a more human scale would be much better, aesthetically. But I also think that even too much of that will strain the infrastructure in LIC. <br /><br />You&#039;re right: It all comes down to what benefits the developers. Because it&#039;s not a matter of will they make money? They will make money no matter what. But they need to squeeze as much out of the land they own as the City will allow, and the City seems to say, &quot;Go for it! The sky&#039;s the limit!&quot; </div>

I suppose if I comb through the pages enough I might find out who the top person is. I did find a number of neighborhood rezoning proposals that sounded impressive, until I started to pick up on the fact that (duh) they&#039;re <em>phrased</em> to sound impressive. I mean, they&#039;re not going to say, &quot;The Department wants to rezone XXX neighborhood to allow a lot more high-rise and commercial development than was allowed before,&quot; they&#039;re going to say &quot;to preserve the existing scale and character of the area while allowing for a modest increase in residential and commercial density in appropriate limited locations.&quot; I think it&#039;s the kind of thing where you have to know enough to read between the lines.<br /><br />It is very interesting reading, though. For instance, back in 2005, a rezoning proposal was passed that would restrict future residential construction in Cambria Heights to one- and two-family houses and even set regulations about floor area, front yard size, and height and setback measurements that would &quot;more closely reflect the scale of surrounding homes.&quot; And other proposals have been passed since then that also set limits on the scale of new residential and commercial construction, with an eye toward maintaining the character of the neighborhood. So that has been going on around Queens. They even passed a rezoning proposal designed to restrict overdevelopment in Sunnyside and Woodside and impose restrictions on the construction of &quot;unpredictable building types that can lead to out-of-character construction&quot;! But the Sunnyside/Woodside proposal was also more complicated than others I saw, which seemed to be because they were attempting to embrace (or at least accept) a certain amount of growth and at the same time provide incentives for the construction of affordable housing.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, this post is long and strays a bit off-topic. But the bottom line is, there&#039;s been rezoning all over Queens designed to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods. So sometimes that does happen. But other times, for whatever reason, it doesn&#039;t.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_71308">I see all these developments as collectively being a positive for Queens and NYC, with qualifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On the upside, there is a huge, unmet need for housing and all these towers do help to some degree, although unfortunately only for a relatively small group of well-heeled buyers and renters. Also, having high-end, high density development clustered in LIC may reduce some of the density and gentrification pressure on older established neighborhoods like JH, Sunnyside, Woodside, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus, the area is served by multiple subway lines and is only a stop or two into Manhattan so the pressure on mass transit is less than would be the case if comparable developments were to spring up in other parts of Queens.&nbsp; If we have to build up, up and up, this seems just about the best place to do so.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, for me at least, there is a kind of glitzy appeal to seeing all these towers together, particularly as the 7 train threads its way through. (They already look much better than “luxury” towers from the 60s and 70s on the UES and elsewhere, which were horrible when built and have gotten worse with age.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />It would be much better if the light manufacturing jobs that used to dominate that area were still plentiful providing working people with living wage jobs.&nbsp; But given economic forces at large, those seem to unfortunately be disappearing (if not already all gone) irrespective of demand for residential units and office towers.&nbsp; It would also be much better if these units were more affordable but for reasons that I do not fully understand it seems impossible to build units for middle/moderate income people in NYC without heavy subsidies. <br /></div>

(BTW, I don&#039;t believe for a minute that the subways won&#039;t suffer increased overcrowding, even if they are pretty close to Manhattan.) It seems to me the &quot;planning&quot; involved centers around greed to make as much profit as possible as quickly as possible (yeah, that &quot;better the investments of present and potential property owners&quot; part, which is largely about property-owning <em>developers</em>). It steadily makes it less and less feasible for the residents who have lived there for years to stay there, as they&#039;re pushed out by skyrocketing housing costs driven by that investment-bettering frenzy. You can&#039;t say it hasn&#039;t already happened elsewhere in the city. It bothers some of us more than it bothers others. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_71364">My response is only kneejerk in the sense that I&#039;ve watched what&#039;s happened in this city over all the years I&#039;ve lived here and I do assume, when I see something like this, that it is going to benefit developers and the wealthy, since that&#039;s what I&#039;ve seen happen time and again. I don&#039;t see any sign that LIC will be any different. The housing that is being built in NYC is largely &quot;luxury&quot;-priced housing. Some of the buildings are required to have &quot;affordable&quot; apartments, but not all of them. <br /><br />I&#039;ll assume that 1 million statistic is correct (and that those are all full-time residents). It&#039;s amazing that so many people have squeezed into this city. I don&#039;t have statistics at hand to back me up, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the overcrowding you mentioned is not among the wealthy, who seem to do just fine in this city. So hundreds of thousands of people are flocking to NYC, and what gets built? More housing for the wealthy.<br /><br />I can guess at what comes next: Building more housing for the wealthy frees up existing housing for the, er, not wealthy. It makes sense, doesn&#039;t it? But despite all the building that&#039;s been going on for years all over Manhattan and in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, it doesn&#039;t seem to me that it&#039;s resulted in a noticeable increase in available housing for lower- and middle-income people. Okay, wait...let me guess...that&#039;s because not <em>enough</em> housing for the wealthy is being built, and if it were, lower- and middle-income people would have plenty of affordable housing to choose from! My kneejerk reaction: That will never happen. Now, neighborhoods do change, and prices in ones that change for the worse may start to go down. But I don&#039;t see all of this new construction having the effect of creating more decent, affordable housing for the lower-income brackets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before I get off this damned soapbox, I will say this: I do admit to not giving anywhere <em>near</em> as much weight to future residents or developers when it comes to what happens in any neighborhood in New York. The city as a whole, yes, I do give weight to that. And in a very general way, of course, I consider the needs of future residents. But not at the expense of current residents and property owners. And, seriously? I don&#039;t think my recommendation of &quot;Be conservative...slow down a little and plan for the impact on the neighborhood&quot; would do a disservice to future residents (unless you include as future residents the ones who go elsewhere because not enough swanky boxes with Manhattan views will be available as soon as they want them). Oh, and about the developers: Zero weight.<br /><br />By the way, I know nothing I&#039;ve said will change your take on this, or that of anyone else who disagrees with me. I just had to say it because I wouldn&#039;t feel right if I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
