			Lamoon Thai is closing<br /><br />https://www.instagram.com/p/CSiOxcoM3i2/<br /><br />This is one of the most remarkable restaurants Iâ€™ve ever eaten at, and I include Michelin starred places in that list. Easily the equal - or better - of Ayada (or Sripraphi back in the old days), the owners are super friendly and kind, the food is spectacular and so culinarily creative. <br /><br />They close on Aug 31.<br /><br />&nbsp;Last chance to see, people.<br /><br />&nbsp;Send them some love or better yet, some takeout orders to send them off.<br /><br />https://www.lamoonthainy.com/<br /><br /><br />

I will go Lamoon one last time before they close :(<br /><br />Thanks for the head&#039;s up.

			Had an excellent, final lunch there yesterday. <br />According to the woman who waited on me they plan to reopen in October as a Thai BBQ.
