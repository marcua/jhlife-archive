				Has anyone tried the new(ish) restaurant called &quot;Texas BBQ&quot; or something like that on the corner of 37th and the mid eighties?&nbsp; Looks like a nice place from the outside, but have not ventured in.

				Corner of 84 street, it&#039;s okay, not great. There is a language barrier, but the help is very nice, the food is just mediocre.

				Nothing Texas about it. It&#039;s a Colombian restaurant with some margaritas.

				I know several residents who have gone there once and never returned because it is expensive&nbsp; and the name &quot;Texas&quot; is deceiving.

				I have been there a few times and enjoyed it. The fajitas are huge, we split an appetizer and share the fajitas. I am a big fan of their grilled vegetables. The service has been amazing and they are really kid friendly. I also feel like it has decent ambiance as JH restaurants go.

				It turns out the restaurant is called Texas Cafe (apologies) and thanks for the reviews.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sounds like 2 against, one for and so so...so far.

				I&#039;ve been there a couple of times with some friends.&nbsp; Friends didn&#039;t like it, but I think their complaints were more focused on the service rather than the food.&nbsp; We had the skirt steak...huge and affordably priced.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the steaks were not grilled to our specifications and had to be returned twice before they got them right.&nbsp; This was closer to their grand opening, so I chalked it up to inexperience.&nbsp; I know the guys we were hanging out with were admiring the waitresses in their bustiers.&nbsp; :coolsmiley:

				My friend went to Margarita&#039;s on 37th and 84th twice this week and she said it was very good from food to service.&nbsp; It was the Texas BQ place before.&nbsp; it doesn&#039;t look much different and I&#039;m not sure if it is the same owners but I heard they have a mix of Mexican, Colombian and steaks on their menu.&nbsp; &nbsp;They also serve free nachos and salsa. Has anyone else tried it since the change?

				I hadn&#039;t even noticed the name had changed (and I walk past it daily!) <br /><br />I tried it once as the Texas Grill and except for the fact that the waitresses were forced to wear humiliating outfits, it wasn&#039;t bad - but I never went back.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\

				I am not a fan. <br /><br />Number 1: it is not really a Texas place. I wanted something new and was excited, but other than a few vaguely Mexican offerings, it seems to pretty much be a Colombian restaurant.<br /><br />Number 2: the one time I did go, I decided to live it up and order a filet mignon.&nbsp; Obviously I can&#039;t prove the correlation, but I woke later on with food poisoning.<br /><br />Number 3: Not very good service, imo.&nbsp; Unfriendly and unaccomodating.
