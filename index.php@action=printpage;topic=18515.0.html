				I recently had the occasion to search for a place that makes marzipan acorns (a favorite recipe my mom used to make when she was alive) and found them at Li-Lac Chocolates (https://www.li-lacchocolates.com/). They have a few locations around Manhattan and a factory in Brooklyn.<br /><br />(https://www.asliceofbrooklyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/unnamed-2.jpg)<br /><br />I also recently tried a piece of chocolate at Jacques Torres in Dumbo with a few of my JH friends&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Do you have a favorite chocolate shop?

				I try to avoid chocolatiers for obvious reasons, but have tried Li-Lac at the Chelsea Market location. Anything with nuts is a go with me.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />There&#039;s a Japanese chocolatier across from Bryant Park, Royce&#039; Chocolates (https://order.royceconfectusa.com/), that I&#039;m interested in trying out. They have a few interesting combinations like their Nama Chocolate &quot;Mojito&quot;, and Maccha Chocolate. Will report back on these!

				I&#039;m intrigued by Royce - thanks for mentioning it. I&#039;ve been trying to think of something to bring to my Thanksgiving hosts and this seems like it might be an interesting option. Happy to see there&#039;s a location a few blocks from my office.

				I was by Bryant Park this past weekend and had the opportunity to stop by Royce’ Chocolates. It’s hard to imagine a chocolate confection being refreshing and light, but that’s how I would describe the Nama Chocolate Mojito. The website says the chocolate is infused with Havana Club rum, yet I found the classic “Mojito” flavors very subtle, with no lingering alcohol taste.&nbsp; I’m not a big fan of white chocolate, but have to admit that the Mojito’s flavor is pleasing. They packaged my chocolate box in a cooling pouch so as to maintain its smooth, velvety texture during travel. Now I’m even more curious about the other varieties! On a side note, I also stopped at the Max Brenner shop in Bryant Park and picked up a small sampler. These were also very good, but I enjoyed the Royce’ more so.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/akZYeIT.jpg)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I bought a few things from Royce to bring to Thanksgiving and I actually thought it was all pretty bad. They were out of the one thing I wanted to try (something with marshmallows, I can&#039;t remember what). Maybe I just chose badly.

I only tried the Mojito this time and did like it. I guess part of the appeal for me is its unique flavor... different from traditional chocolates, which I also love.

				There&#039;s a really good chocolate place in Forest Hills, on Metropolitan. Sometimes I&#039;ll take a little detour when I&#039;m on my way to my favorite comic store to buy me (and maybe my family if I&#039;m feeling particularly generous) some delicious chocolate treats. <br /><br />http://www.aignerchocolates.com/
