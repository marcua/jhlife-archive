				Does anyone remember Joe&#039;s Candy Store, located on Northern Blvd. between 84th and 83rd Streets? When I was a kid in the 60&#039;s, I was there practically every day (I lived right around the corner from it). The comic books were always nicely spread out on wooden shelves. The owner, Joe Axelrod, was great to the neighborhood kids. If you didn&#039;t know him, he could be a little intimidating -- a big, gaunt kind of guy with a deep voice. He was a great guy. He knew how much I loved comic books. One day, just before my family was set to head out to Long Island for a few weeks&#039; vacation, the new comics came in. Joe knew I would be going away that day, so he opened them just for me. We sat together as he opened the bundles, and I would pick out the ones I wanted. It&#039;s a great memory, and Joe&#039;s Candy Store will always have a place in my heart.

				I think we are talking about the same store - on the north side of the street? &nbsp;If so, there was a funny story about it. &nbsp;My aunt lived on 83rd and used to often stop and chat with the owner. &nbsp;She was single and, as they said back then, &quot;went to business.&quot; &nbsp;One day, the owner told her about a really lovely man who stopped in on Sundays to buy a paper. &nbsp;He went on that the guy seemed a fine, refined man and that he, the owner, would like to introduce them. &nbsp;He must have been an awfully nice man to take such an interest in her, but it turned out the fellow he was trying to fix her up with was her own brother - who used to visit her on Sundays!

				During WWII, the candy store between 83rd &amp; 84th St. on Northern Blvd. (north-side) was owned by a couple named Weber. He always had a cigar in his mouth. They were not related to Jacob Weber who operated the drug store on the NW corner of Northern Blvd and 84th St. The candy store on the south-side of the Blvd (also between 83rd &amp; 84th St.) was owned by a couple whose name was Furst. After his health failed, their niece Gloria Rubin and her husband Harry moved down from Hartford CT. and ran the store. He was a WWII veteran who participated in the D-Day invasion at Normandy. Harry was a most friendly and congenial man. He drew many new customers to this formerly slow business.&nbsp; &nbsp;
