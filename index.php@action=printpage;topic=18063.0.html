				Does anybody have any experience with this gym?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen conversations re Blink on Roosevelt in the low 70&#039;s but I don&#039;t recall any talk of PF.<br />

				Weekday mornings: Weight machines are often all in use after 7am, but there&#039;s always open cardio. Locker room (mens) is clean. The more popular machines are starting to show some wear—handgrips falling off, missing/broken pins, etc. For $10/month it&#039;s hard to ask for much more than what they provide.

				They require you to pay by bank account, just fyi. No credit cards.

				Became a PF global member because we go upstate most weekends and there&#039;s a PF up there that we go to.&nbsp; The upstate PF is amazing -- super clean, new machines, all in great shape, about 10 tanning rooms with different machines, a couple of massage chairs, a UV room, etc.&nbsp; The one by us is more limited, but I only use it when I want to do some cardio and I don&#039;t want to travel to Equinox in the city so I only go downstairs to the weight area to change in the locker room if it&#039;s winter.<br /><br />The downstairs weight area looks small and is pretty much always crowded.&nbsp; I find it less appealing than the Blink in our area because it has zero natural light and the air circulation isn&#039;t that great.&nbsp; The upstairs cardio area is great, with a ton of machines, but upkeep is an issue.&nbsp; Many TV&#039;s on the machines don&#039;t work anymore, some need to be oiled and adjusted and there are signs that the machines are fraying.&nbsp; They need better maintenance.<br /><br />On the plus side, it&#039;s always clean, the locker room is big and I never had a problem finding a locker.&nbsp; If you mainly do cardio, this gym is pretty good.&nbsp; The people that work out here clean the machines after working out and are friendly.&nbsp; If you occasionally do weights, then I&#039;d say you can make due here.&nbsp; If you want to focus on weights, find another gym (not Blink either).<br /><br />All in all, it&#039;s a good gym, especially for the price.&nbsp; Become a black card member and you can use any PF anywhere.&nbsp; The PF&#039;s outside the city are amazing, since I&#039;ve been to quite a few.<br />

It&#039;s all about how they want to make it VERY difficult for you to cancel. It&#039;s a very common tactic with gyms and has nothing to do with credit card fees.

				One of the reasons I haven&#039;t joined PF is because it&#039;s only good for cardio if you are fine using a machine. Want to do your own designed Tabata workout? 10 minutes on an ab workout? Good luck finding a place to do it safely.<br /><br />Blink has a space for that, but Blink was always so crowded it was hard to get the space in that area.<br /><br />There&#039;s another gym directly across Roosevelt on the second floor that has a fitness studio that works if you want to do something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5bBZ55tlE<br />
