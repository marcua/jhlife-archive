				Why do these type of events always result in violence and crime? Three years ago while I was at Queens Center a large brawl broke out and at that point I decided I would probably not return. I had enjoyed going to this mall since it opened in the mid 70&#039;s and now after the latest incident I doubt I&#039;ll be back.<br /><br />https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/03/08/rapper-queens-mall-riots-looting/

				They happen because the organizers try to fit in three times the legal number of people. The same artist played at Brooklyn Steel tonight with no issues at all

				Obviously the rapper community is known for years to bring violence, crime and outlaws to their events. Puma should be sued for creating this hazard plus police costs. A retail store is not a rapper venue. The Queens Center mall should also be held responsible for any injuries that resulted from this incident.

It was mostly young 14-16 yrs old kids and they were more thrilled than anything at the excitement level. A few bad actors were causing the disturbances. The half day of school in NYC unfortunately lined up with this event in a bad way. The theft and other fighting seemed like add ons to the huge amount of young people swarming the place. I did feel concerned for the stores and their personnel as they seemed very confused about what was causing this mass of kids. Otherwise, I find this mall to be one of the best I&#039;ve ever shopped at and they have a variety of stores that my family likes specifically for shoes. Personally think it was a fluke occurrence.

Too bad there aren&#039;t more bookstores in Queens or one that would have been big enough to handle the crowds.&nbsp;

				Where you get that these mostly African American teenagers are from Westchester or Nassau County is beyond me and I believe an attempt to blame wealthy suburbs for inner city violence. Those kids are from NYC. Maybe not JH.
