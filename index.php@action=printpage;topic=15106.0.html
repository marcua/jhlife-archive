				Today as I was waiting for the bus they were digging with a huge drill that looked like it weighed a thousand pounds. The&nbsp; noise was deafening. I complained to some MTA employees who were nearby in their car and left. My ears are still ringing. How are they allowed to do this with people right there? They should of closed off the whole area. I&#039;ve never heard noise so loud in my life!! I don&#039;t think 311 takes complaints over construction noise. Who would you complain to?

				<br />Why does an important hub station like our own 74th Street seems to have no user group that regularly meets with the manager of the station or with the MTA. Certainly one basic issue might be the level of cleanliness on the subway tracks,platforms,tile walls, and the terminal itself. When you look down from the elevator on the Flushing side you see layers of filth encrusted on the lights. The elevator itself usually reeks of urine. This lack of care becomes self perpetuating as many users come to expect that this is just the way it is.<br />But beyond that base line issue are other things less critical but still an element in creating a positive quality of life for commuters. That might include more interesting wall displays for example.In the London Network there is video based advertising that offsets the cost of maintaining the system. Why are we stuck with billboards that reflects a hundred year old form and in any event just become the target for graffiti? Why is there no trafficator that shows all the bus lines and their arrival and departure times?<br /><br />Whether or not any of these things are implementable is less of a question then why we don&#039;t have the possibility of meeting with the administrators and managers of a service we use and pay for.<br />
