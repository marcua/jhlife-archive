				<strong>Here are the Rules and Guidelines for this Site (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=48).</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />In general, this forum strives to provide for the maximum possible freedom of speech, without allowing conditions that create a hostile, threatening, or harmful environment of its users.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As currently written, the guidelines do not prohibit posts that speculate about individuals&#039; motives and character.&nbsp; <br />As I see it, like name calling (which is already forbidden), these types of comments can be very damaging to people, and are virtually impossible to rebut or defend against.&nbsp; The moderators recently removed some comments from the Realtor/Broker Recommendations thread, and are evaluating whether to revise the rules of the forum to discourage these types of comments.<br /><br />Your thoughts on this are welcome here.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I&#039;m probably mangling Habermas here, but true discourse in the public realm cannot take place under threatening conditions.&nbsp; Our forum rules are less concerned with what might be offensive, than with what might be menacing or harmful to the forum participants.

				IMHO, micro-managing anything can have disastrous results. The rules are there for anyone to read. Most topics will go off on many tangents and still be interesting reading. It should be the job of the mods to strike out anything inflammatory or personally insulting or offensive, and state in the post why something was deemed against the rules and therefore deleted. Avela stated an opinion. I pos nodded the post because it seemed to me that it took a lot of courage to say what was said as the OP posted 2 days prior and no-one else wanted to venture in on this discussion. We are mostly adults who really don&#039;t require a class monitor. ::Gee, I wonder if they still have them?::

				When we set out to establish Jackson Heights Life as a resource for building community within Jackson Heights, we knew from the beginning that two key issues -- protection of privacy and maximizing freedom of speech -- would pose the thorniest challenges.&nbsp; These two goals are often in conflict, and our role as moderators of the forum is to seek an appropriate balance between the two.&nbsp; This effort remains a work in progress.<br /><br />We have grown concerned about the discussion and speculation about private individuals in this forum.&nbsp; Such discussion -- even if done without malicious intent -- can be very damaging to them, especially if it is done without their knowledge and they don&#039;t have an opportunity to respond.<br /><br />After careful consideration, we have decided to establish a new rule prohibiting the discussion of the behavior or motivations of private individuals.&nbsp; We have removed two threads where these types of posts have been particularly common: &quot;Classic Characters&quot; and &quot;Skid Row.&quot;&nbsp; Although nothing that was posted there was intended to attack individuals personally, their effect could be seen as an invasion of privacy that might be isolating and intimidating for the individuals being described and discussed.<br /><br />This decision was a difficult one, and we welcome your feedback.&nbsp; We are aware that the new rule is vague and needs to be sharpened to work effectively over the long run.&nbsp; The community&#039;s guidance on how to do this would be appreciated.<br /><br /><div align="center">--Shelby2, Toddg and Merm</div>

				Had to think about this for awhile before replying.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re right to remove the threads.&nbsp; I remember making a comment in the Classic Characters about someone I met while walking my dog but don&#039;t really remember the Skid Row thread. (And may have commented there too, but just don&#039;t remember.)&nbsp; I think if I were to read something written about me in either thread, my feelings would be hurt.&nbsp; &nbsp; At the time, it seemed harmless and benign and I do think the comments were not meant to be anything but fun.&nbsp; So I can only go by how I&#039;d feel.&nbsp; I know some of the comments back and forth on other threads get passionate at times.&nbsp; Or if passionate is too strong a word, then I&#039;d say people write with much feeling.&nbsp; But they&#039;re comments where people are sharing their opinion on a &quot;subject&quot; and the subject isn&#039;t a person.&nbsp; &nbsp;But these threads didn&#039;t give a pro or con on a topic (again, I don&#039;t remember Skid Row&#039;s content).&nbsp; They just talked about people in a playful (but could actually end up being hurtful) manner.&nbsp; And, like I said, I commented there.&nbsp; Live and learn. Thanks.

				Privacy and (free) speech are competing rights that will never be resolved by censorship. Doing so can only have pejorative consequences. Everyone should have the right of freedom of expression in this or any other forum. This right should include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by URL owners and their moderators. Over the past few decades, the struggle to define privacy has become more confused. Even the concept of privacy has become very difficult to define. Is it possible to judge whether what you write or say in a forum like this will cause emotional harm? How do you define what people cannot talk or write about? Should free expression be treated on a par with privacy in the first place?<br /><br />Freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy.<br /><br />Having free speech being censored in the name of privacy is absurd. <br /><br />I read both the removed threads. I found nothing either harmful or litigious in either of them. I also found nothing that could have been hurtful to the persons mentioned. All I saw were descriptions of sad, homeless people living in the neighborhood. It was a lively discussion by local residents who were simply relating information via their opinions to other local residents. As a consequence, I personally find that the removal of these 2 threads were decided in an arbitrary manner. <br /><br />If someone approached you and expressed their displeasure with these threads, then it would be incumbent on you to tell the posters on this forum what was said and that that was part of the reasoning behind this decision. <br /><br />I somewhat understood the reasoning behind merm&#039;s thought process questioning whether or not to shut down the political threads on your sister forum, Astorians. There were some very nasty personal insults that truly needed to be moderated, although the the threads&#039; posters seemed to be doing a rather good job of that themselves. <br /><br />I grant that the privacy issue is an important one. But, I see no such issue with either of those threads.<br /><br />No-one disclosed any secrets. No-one divulged anything that the community-at-large did not already know about. The people mentioned were also not harmed by the description of them and where they are usually found. No-one was provocative or disrespectful in either thread. If there were any inaccuracies they were quickly corrected by the posters themselves. It was a non-threatening, intelligent discussion among neighbors. As I recall, there was no defamation of any of the people discussed. There also were no derogatory comments about any one particular person. It also seems to me that people only expressed what they saw and that is information available to anyone in the neighborhood. It&#039;s not like someone used an illegal method to obtain that information!<br /><br />I am also distressed that these threads were removed before any discussion about their potential removal. It would have been interesting to see how the JHL members felt about it. In general, it would be interesting to see how either forum would feel about being micromanaged to the point of making the forum no longer a viable part of the community. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=575.msg3147#msg3147">Quote from: toddg on March 07, 2008, 10:36:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We have grown concerned about the discussion and speculation about private individuals in this forum.&nbsp; Such discussion -- even if done without malicious intent -- can be very damaging to them, especially if it is done without their knowledge and they don&#039;t have an opportunity to respond.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I, for one, would very much like to know exactly how these discussions could even be perceived as damaging, even if done without the individuals&#039; knowledge. Astorians has a homeless man who periodically finds a way to a computer and posts in the forum. He has said many times that he is encouraged by the discussions of Astoria&#039;s homeless. He tells us not to worry about certain persons that the community-at-large had preconceived notions about being dangerous. Many of Astoria&#039;s older residents know him personally and have frequent discussions about what we can do to help the homeless in our area. He always recommends keeping an open discussion so that the situation just doesn&#039;t disappear into a twilight zone. He knows that the majority of people really care, and by calling attention to those individuals, someone may seek them out and be able to provide some help.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=575.msg3147#msg3147">Quote from: toddg on March 07, 2008, 10:36:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">After careful consideration, we have decided to establish a new rule prohibiting the discussion of the behavior or motivations of private individuals.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How absurd can you get. I guess that means that every elected official has the right to claim that they are also private individuals. So, let&#039;s stop calling those who do nothing in the interest of their constituents useless and try to get them replaced. If someone were to remark that XXX poster has a great sense of humor and is always trying to make people in the forum laughâ€”that too would fall under your new prohibition. How about if someone posted that the super at ##-## Street told them that he demanded 2 months rent for them to be approved for renting an apartment, how would that clash with your new rule?<br /><br />Not only is the new rule vague, IMHO it is both not necessary and disrespectful of the intelligence of the members of this forum.<br /><br />

				In every forum, listserv, other online community I&#039;ve been part of (in many different contexts), there&#039;s always a struggle over how much moderation is necessary - from a heavy hand that keeps the community seemingly polite and mission focused on the surface but with tensions broiling underneath to almost no moderation which often leads to an utter breakdown.&nbsp; Despite the reminders in the rules and guidelines that we aren&#039;t necessarily strangers to each other - though who really knows whose posting here, right? - we ARE all going to act differently online than we would in a community meeting.&nbsp; Just the facts of online life.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s ever one right answer on the moderation question even for any single online community.&nbsp; I will say that the one thing that seems to be constant is that there are the fewest disagreements over moderation when it&#039;s very clear what the guidelines are, who gets to put them into place, and who gets to police them.&nbsp; Fewer, but they never end.<br /><br /><strong>I&#039;m incredibly grateful to the three of you who are giving your time and money to make this work for the rest of us!</strong>&nbsp; And, I&#039;m grateful that you seem to be doing it in a thoughtful manner and looking for input in making decisions.<br /><br />I keep just using the vague word moderation because I&#039;m not sure that I agree with the terms you used to describe potential problems with these particular threads (free speech vs privacy).&nbsp; I did not contribute to those threads (though I continued to read them), because I did find them a bit strange.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find them off-putting enough, though, to say so publicly on the threads, even in a non-judgmental - hey I was reading them!! - and polite way.&nbsp; Perhaps as the site matures, those who turn into old-timers (in internet time) will get more used to self-policing and help direct threads.<br /><br />In this case, it seems that rather than delete the threads, it might have been wiser for someone - possibly a moderator whether in his/her personal voice or as a forum leader - to step in and start a discussion about the wisdom of those threads.&nbsp; For the record - unless there are posts that were deleted or that I missed - I agree with NYCMacUser that the posts didn&#039;t seem to cross any lines into what could have been ugly subjects.&nbsp; I guess I did in some way find them a bit odd, though not quite distasteful, but the discussion of individuals&#039; public selves does not in itself seem to violate their privacy.&nbsp; Do I agree with your characterization that despite good intentions, the effect may have been intimidating and isolating?&nbsp; Yes, in fact.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t think that meant that they should be deleted.<br /><br />[And as we&#039;ve already seen, especially in our community, ANY topic very quickly can end up with all sorts of overtones about socio-economic class, country of origin, race, and ethnicity.&nbsp; These can be both productive and interesting parts of community building and divisive.&nbsp; I hope we are able to continue to engage these issues in good constructive ways.]<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this all is related to other questions that have already come up about complaints (and praise?) for those doing business in our neighborhood.&nbsp; You say that not every post is read/moderated.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t see how you&#039;ll be able to successfully balance that desire for a fairly open forum and keep discussion away from individuals&#039; behavior and/or motivation.&nbsp; When do you lay down the law amongst &quot;Store Y has great z for sale;&quot; &quot;there&#039;s one person working at Store Y who will go out of his/her way in x and y fashion for you;&quot; &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y because s/he won&#039;t do x or y;&quot; and &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y who won&#039;t do x or y for you because person Z is lazy and is also trying to put his/her boss out of business so his/her cousin can buy the store cheaply.&quot;&nbsp; Everything but the first sentence talks about someone&#039;s behavior and motivation.&nbsp; [ok - weird example on my part, but I&#039;m not going to spend the time to come up with another one.]&nbsp; I&#039;ve quite happily participated in heavily moderated forums, and am happy to do so here, but that takes a LOT of work by the moderators because self-policing does NOT cut it.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s bad precedent to have rules that are therefore constantly broken.<br /><br />I think the current rules and guidelines are quite good.&nbsp; Would you consider doing two things though?&nbsp; One - in addition to the link at the top of the page, maybe pin a link to them on every board since that tends to be more in our line of site as a reminder to check the rules than it would be as it is posted now.&nbsp; And, if the founders/moderators feel comfortable, would you add a second post to the rules laying out who started this site, who has moderation power, whether that rotates ever, how to complain about a post, even who is paying the server bill, etc.&nbsp; The rules go in and out of talking as if everyone registered wrote them and an &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp; I did write &quot;you&quot; a lot in the paragraph above.&nbsp; At least as long as the site is still young, it&#039;s clearly someone else&#039;s (or rather several someones) site that I&#039;m participating in, not my site.&nbsp; Which is cool with me - I didn&#039;t put this party together - and maybe it&#039;s your intention is to change that balance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m really thankful for the dedication already to transparency; I&#039;d love to see that go further and continue.

				I loved reading both your comments NYCMacUser and jsh.&nbsp; Both heartfelt.&nbsp; I did want to disagree with one thing though: <br /><br />&lt;&lt;I guess that means that every elected official has the right to claim that they are also private individuals. &gt;&gt; NYCMacUser<br /><br />I would just like to say that elected officials, people in the news in general, knowingly chose to put themselves &quot;out there&quot; for public consumption.&nbsp; I agree with both of you about privacy and free speech and what I remember of the threads was not malicious but if any of the people we were discussing were to read the comments, I think feelings would be hurt.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like they knowingly put themselves out there. &nbsp; For me, that&#039;s the real reason why I don&#039;t mind the threads no longer existing.&nbsp; (But I guess the mods. could have made it an open discussion first.)&nbsp; Then again, it&#039;s their site. This may sound childish but if I throw a party, invite you to come and have games to play and want you to play by my rules.... you don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; But it&#039;s still my party and my rules.&nbsp; (I sound like a twit compared to the two of you but I hope you know what I mean.)&nbsp; If you start a site, you should be able to make the rules.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For me it&#039;s less about privacy or free speech and more about this is their party and it&#039;s how they want to play.&nbsp;

				NYCMacUser, jsh, and buddy--<br /><br />Thank you all for your carefully considered thoughts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to respond to them now, as I&#039;m hoping to learn from what others have to say on this issue as well.<br /><br />However, there are some additional questions I&#039;d like to put on the table.<br /><br />First, all three of the moderators are longtime users of online forums, so we&#039;re aware that we have deviated from the norms in how these are managed.&nbsp; I personally am a fan of Wired New York, and admire how they&#039;ve cultivated a successful community with very little moderator intervention.&nbsp; But JHLife serves a different niche and a different purpose.&nbsp; Its goal is to build community and bring people together in real space.&nbsp; I see it as serving a public interest function beyond simply the exchange of ideas.&nbsp; Are there certain rules or norms that need to be put in place in order to fulfill that objective?&nbsp; We simply don&#039;t know, and are looking for models of other sites that have wrestled with these issues.&nbsp; Any suggestions for where we should look would be welcome.<br /><br />Second, to me, the privacy issue is real.&nbsp; Not only is it an issue today, but it is also entirely possible that a forum like this, or at least its archives, could exist for decades.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think our society has begun to grapple with the implications of that.&nbsp; But if we want to be proactive to prevent future harm, what precautionary steps should we be taking now?&nbsp; Again, there are no easy answers, and if there are other boards that are looking at these questions, we&#039;d like to know about them.<br /><br />Please keep up the feedback and advice.&nbsp; We are listening and value your input.&nbsp; This is a work in progress.

Perhaps it requires a statement of purpose. Or maybe a Mission Statement? Have you asked your members what they want/expect from JHL? Or, for that matter, do you really care? You have already stated that your goal was to build community by bringing people together in real space; but I see no agenda of doing that. Here, in virtual space, the communication of people&#039;s ideas supersedes the dissemination of public interest information. Most of that is available in so many other places on the world-wide netz. <br /><br />Instead of having a people-based, community-driven or a community-based, people-driven forum, you might reconsider the whole concept and turn it into an old-fashioned BBS where folks could find out neighborhood happenings and plan their schedules around those activities.<br /><br />Before you make any hard-fast decisions it behooves you to deliberate on how quickly political correctness changes. What seems appropriate today may be demeaned tomorrow.<br /><br />I am continually amazed at how many people do not engage in controversial threads. The tell is the number of replies vs the views. If the topic was not interesting to them, they would not be reading it. What do you think keeps those lurkers from posting? In the same vein of thought, I also find it interesting to see the equation in those posts that have no replies and very few reads. Does that mean that they are not interesting to the audience?<br /><br />Did you yet determine your demographic? It couldn&#039;t be more different than Astorians! Yet it is equally as different as Jackson Heights is from Astoria. If, you based your goal for this forum on what you&#039;ve seen at Astorians, then you do have to seriously alter the concept. <br /><br /><strong>TO THE LURKERS IN THIS THREAD:</strong><br />Please step up to the microphone and let your voices be heard. If this forum is going to represent you, even with the already stated goals, you need to let merm, Toddg and Shelby2 know what you want/expect from this site. If you want it to be an informational resource, tell them. If you want it to be a place to make local friendships through public meetings and events, then tell them that. If you simply want to be able to discuss the neighborhood or if you want to be able to hold discussions about anything, let them know that.<br /><br />Remember, just like in an election if you don&#039;t vote then you don&#039;t have any right to complain about who gets elected. If you don&#039;t speak up now, you will have no right to complain about the direction this forum pursues.<br /><br />As of this writing, there have been 6 replies to this thread, but 87 views. STOP JUST READING THIS AND SAY SOMETHING, please.

				ok, my 2 cents: &nbsp;I read at least some of the threads and agree that a moderator stepping in would&#039;ve been better than removing them. &nbsp; Maybe the rules can include the idea that there can be a limit to the length of a thread (or number of comments) discussing a private individual without their knowledge, period, without even having to &quot;speculate about behavior and motivation&quot;, etc.? &nbsp;To me it seems more a question of courtesy than one of free speech. &nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think censorship is good, but since it is a community site I think kindness (not politically correct-ness) now and then is not a bad thing. &nbsp; Ultimately, though, I hope the site will be as open as possible even if it gets uncomfortable sometimes.

				I stumbled upon this site a few days ago, so I did not have an opportunity to view the two threads in question.<br /><br />However, I will share that privacy and safety were pretty big concerns for me upon registration. I am basically putting myself in a position where strangers could potentially identify me based on harmless clues they pick up on this site. This is a BIG DEAL and I was completely aware this was the decision I was making when I signed up. If my weird, stinky neighbor comes up to me tomorrow and tells me he digs the white bob I&#039;m rockin&#039; on that picture in JHL, I&#039;d have no one to blame but myself.<br /><br />Now, had someone identified me before I signed up, based on information they read about me from someone else on this site, that would have been dangerous and an absolute invasion of my privacy.<br /><br />Therefore, I am siding with the moderators on this decision. I don&#039;t believe it is a matter of free speech as much as it is of safety and respect for everyone&#039;s privacy.<br />

				I remember reading posts in both threads mentioned and initially I found them to be a little odd... why were we discussing these people, and sharing details about them from hearsay and rumor ? Since I wasn&#039;t 100% comfortable with the threads I didn&#039;t post anything. That was my way of staying out of the conversation. If I recall correctly, the threads themselves were not incredibly active after a while. I think the topics were exaughsted because there&#039;s only so much you can say about people you don&#039;t really know. <br /><br />Then it occurred to me that we&#039;re here debating the right to privacy of the individuals who were being discussed. However, some of the people mentioned in the posts lead very public lives, whether it&#039;s marching in parades, whistling all the time, or dressing in a manner that is meant to attract attention. If these individuals stand out in our community then shouldn&#039;t we have the ability to comment on them ? <br /><br />Then there are those whose public lives are beyond their own control and find themselves living on the streets of Jackson Heights. Robert Sukrachand&#039;s photo essay of the homeless people living around 74th St. and Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; (www.74thandroosevelt.com) contains a quote from Ernie one of the homeless residents of that area &quot;You see that guy who just walked in to the liquor store ? He&#039;s been an alcoholic all his life, beats his wife. He&#039;s not homeless so he gets to keep his problems hidden&quot;. It is unfortunate that these people live on our streets, no one should have to. But by virtue of the fact we encounter and interract with them on a daily basis they are part of the public life of Jackson Heights. I think more is done to address the problem of homelessness by discussing it than not. <br /><br /><br />I think the removal of the threads was perhaps a dis-service to the JHlife audience. I think it only serves to sweep a conversation under the rug. More would have been gained by gentle guidance or questioning from the moderators as to the merit of the thread, perhaps turning a&nbsp; frivolous discussion in to a productive one. There are times where removal of an individual post are warranted, but removing an entire thread serves to mute several voices with one mouse click.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do think it&#039;s up to the members of this group to find their own voices and use their own discretion in their postings. The moderators should not be put in a position where they have to make judgment calls on discussions or other people&#039;s opinions. The community should be able to police it self with out much oversight, ideas and thoughts that are counter productive will, in their own time and way, get filtered out by the normal course of discourse. <br /><br />&quot;Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.&quot; <br />&nbsp; --&nbsp; Eleanor Roosevelt

The primary mission of forums like these is not to &quot;uphold the values of free speech&quot;, but to facilitate dialog about X topic; this automatically implies limits on the speech.<br /><br />The argument that a top-down approach to speech moderation in a forum like this stifles dialog and has a negative impact on the community I think is a valid position, but it&#039;s an equally valid position that entirely free conversation would have the same negative impact. The moderators are looking for a balance, and openly recognize the problems inherent with moderating. It&#039;s not easy running a site like this.

				Buddy, <br /><br />Thank you for your thoughtful post.&nbsp; I will do my best to respond in kind (speaking only for myself and not for JHLife or any other individual).<br /><br />If you see me posting in this forum, you should assume that I am doing so as a regular forum participant.&nbsp; I rarely intervene in the role of a moderator ... but yes, I&#039;ve heard you, and will endeavor to find some way to make it clearer when I am doing this.<br /><br />The vast majority of my moderation efforts takes place via private message, assisting new users and answering questions about the forum (that is why I include the label &quot;Moderator&quot; under my name... to help new users find assistance when they need it).&nbsp; A smaller share of my moderation efforts consists of merging similar threads, renaming threads whose discussion has evolved to ensure clarity, helping people correct errors in their posts, attaching events to the calendar, and other such maintenance tasks.&nbsp; When there is an issue that needs to be addressed in the forum, I engage in discussions with the other moderators about the best course of action.<br /><br />You ask:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I can understand limiting hate speech, vulgarity, name calling to name a few but why limit hyperbole?&nbsp; Or impassioned repartee?&nbsp; Who decides for the community participating in any dialogue when itâ€™s enough or too much?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The forum rules (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=48) are the clearest articulation we&#039;ve been able to come up with so far about what is and what is not allowed on the forum.&nbsp; If somebody posts hate speech or vulgarity on the board, chances are you won&#039;t see it, because we delete it immediately.&nbsp; To my knowledge, this has happened only once or twice in the history of this forum.&nbsp; In less clear cut cases, the moderators may take some time to discuss it first, but ultimately offensive posts will have no permanent place on the forum.<br /><br />There is no rule limiting hyperbole or impassioned repartee.&nbsp; But more often than not, posts like that are written to trigger a response.&nbsp; So don&#039;t be surprised (and don&#039;t feel attacked) if posts like this are challenged or result in further debate.&nbsp; As a forum participant, I plan to participate in these discussions, and like any other participant, I expect the privilege of being able to state my views without raising cries of moderator oppression, abuse of power, or trying to sanitize the board.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I donâ€™t think the moderators of this site have clearly stated what the guidelines are or how the site is to be policed.

What do you have against garden clubs. :)<br /><br />Seriously though, I think it&#039;s safe to say that the majority of people actually <em>do not</em> come to this site for &quot;passionate debate&quot;. People come for a wide variety of reasons, and debate is certainly one of them - but I think it&#039;s unfair to characterize most of the audience as coming here for that when my experience is very different. I do not come here for debate - nor do I start community-centered sites to facilitate &quot;debate&quot; exclusively.<br /><br />In the same way that being &quot;overly protective&quot; and not allowing for any debate will drive people away that are looking for this kind of experience, allowing for &quot;free&quot; (abusive, demeaning, etc) debate to have free reign on the site will drive away people who are not looking for that experience - I&#039;m not just saying that flippantly, this is my experience after 8 years of running sties like these.<br /><br />The goal is to find a balance that allows the site to thrive as much as possible - and as you&#039;ve pointed out, it is a work in progress.

				I think the problem here is that the threads in question were removed without notice and then we were informed of a new rule. <br /><br />One of the themes I&#039;m hearing in this discussion is a call for a little more transparency in how this forum is managed. <br /><br />It seems to me that the administrators of this site would take less unmerited heat and benefit from more community involvement before a big decision is made. <br /><br />For whatever reason, I still have faith in humanity and believe if the question of the propriety of the threads was put to the users of this board the vast majority of users might have agreed to at least change the tone of the conversation if not end it all together.

				You&#039;re right, Aronan.&nbsp; This thread was not fully compatible with the rule that we established on this issue.&nbsp; It also illustrates why this is a very difficult issue to attempt to address.&nbsp; Clearly this thread is a sincere discussion about how to help this man, and yet some posts did violate his privacy (at least as currently defined by the JHLife rules).&nbsp; We have now edited the thread to remove speculation about his condition, what substances he consumes, and how he acts.&nbsp; Further discussion on the thread is still possible if it instead focuses on efforts to help him get the services he needs. <br /><br />This is not an attempt to establish a new rule or precedent of any kind; it&#039;s simply an attempt to have this thread match the guidelines on privacy already discussed.

				Godwin&#039;s law is a tradition that has lasted since the early 90s.<br /><br />Excerpt from the Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_Law):<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Godwin&#039;s Law (also known as Godwin&#039;s Rule of Nazi Analogies)[1] is an adage formulated by Mike Godwin in 1990. The law states:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot;<br /><br />Godwin&#039;s Law is often cited in online discussions as a caution against the use of inflammatory rhetoric or exaggerated comparisons, and is often conflated with fallacious arguments of the reductio ad Hitlerum form.<br /><br />The rule does not make any statement whether any particular reference or comparison to Hitler or the Nazis might be appropriate, but only asserts that one arising is increasingly probable. It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate, Godwin has argued that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided, because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact. Although in one of its early forms Godwin&#039;s Law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions, the law is now applied to any threaded online discussion: electronic mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms, and more recently blog comment threads and wiki talk pages.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				Hi, I agree that community building in an online forum inevitably requires editorial control.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to accurately reflect and foster the community&#039;s culture (the fundamental interests that bond the community), minimal content control is key.&nbsp; At the same time, the moderator&#039;s role is essential in protecting the community&#039;s interest by flagging content that either (1) offends the majority of the community&#039;s mores, or (2) could foreseeably threaten the safety of its members. <br /><br />INTEGRITY<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That said, I think that the real issue here lies not in editorial control per se, but rather in the integrity of the community.&nbsp; Some communities are perfectly comfortable with the type of conduct that can be characterized as gossip, exclusivity, embarrassment, chastising, and ridiculing, whether or not the victim of such conduct is aware of what is being said or whether he or she has been given the opportunity to respond.&nbsp; These features of humanity are found everywhere, and as awkward as it is to face, I would find it difficult to believe that anyone can truly &#039;throw stones&#039; here with regards to that conduct.&nbsp; We&#039;ve all had days where saying something awful about someone, or in some way wearing at someone&#039;s dignity or reputation, has been the best cure for a bad mood.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, some communities are also perfectly comfortable with the conduct described above, whether or not it is done privately at a dinner table of like-minded individuals, or publicly in an online forum.&nbsp; I think this is in big part why moderating online content proves challenging.&nbsp; Given that online communities with password-protected content fall somewhere between public&nbsp; <br />forums and private dinner parties, it is hard to say what elements of a community, such as this website, are perceived as deviating from the community&#039;s interest and therefore subject to censorship.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I realize that yet a grayer area here is whether a community generally believes that pointing out where a particular person generally hangs out, homeless or not, is harmless or embarrassing to that person.&nbsp; And whether such conduct is sufficiently deviant to warrant censorship in this particular online community.<br /><br />MY VOTE<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I am hoping to find this blog to embody a relatively high degree of integrity.&nbsp; I&#039;d like for guests to view the content and perceive this community as a mindful and dignified one where people can exchange interesting ideas, announce and review neighborhood events, offer helpful tips, and recommend the very best that Jackson Heights has to offer.&nbsp; If the emerging flavor of the blog is neighborhood gossip - where people hang out, who wore what, etc., - I&#039;d probably be turned off by it and not want to be associated with it.&nbsp; I also wouldn&#039;t recommend the blog to any nice people I meet who is new to the neighborhood.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be clear, I have nothing against people expressing personal opinions.&nbsp; In fact, I think it is an essential factor in community building.&nbsp; I do see it as taking the low road however when actual names and identities are revealed in order to express such views. (e.g., the difference between saying &quot;I can&#039;t stand loud and obnoxious people&quot; versus &quot;Beware Ms. X - that loud and obnoxious individual that without fail can be seen at X shop every day at X:XX p.m.&quot;)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not saying the way I think is the way this blog community should think.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that (1) every community has its standards, (2) editorial control is inevitable in a community building setting, and (3) I hope that Jackson Heights Life can foster a community that takes the high road.&nbsp; If the prevailing culture ultimately ends up being the JH online version of Jerry Springer, then I&#039;m sure another blog can serve me better.&nbsp; But I would be sad about that, and embarrassed to be a JH resident.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have read neither &quot;Classic Characters&quot; nor &quot;Skid Row.&quot;&nbsp; I only stumbled upon this thread and wished to offer my opinion on the topic of speech, privacy, and online communities.

				It should be noted that it&#039;s somewhat bad form to invoke Godwin in IRC or other chats. I don&#039;t recall but it&#039;s usually seen as a faux pas.<br /><br />For my two cents on the free speech issue, I would say that a I don&#039;t own this site, I have reasonable expectations that the owners have the right to ban, block or otherwise censor what they wish when they see fit. If we can&#039;t play nicely, they can take the ball away. That said, it&#039;s in their best interest to condone free conversation among participants.<br /><br />If I wish to create my own site, say whatever I please and offend anyone I wish, that is my right. This doesn&#039;t always gibe with the first amendment, but seems quite fair to me.
