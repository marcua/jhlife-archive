			The link below is about a dog in Brooklyn that collapsed from heat stroke.&nbsp; I know most dog owners are aware of what not to do (don&#039;t leave a dog in a car even for a few minutes on a hot day etc.) but I still wanted to share this because of the heat wave and how heart broken I am at the thought of an animal suffering like this.&nbsp; I&#039;ve spoken to friends and have decided on very hot days to leave the air conditioner on when my dog is home alone.&nbsp; Something I wasn&#039;t doing because I have fans on but I&#039;d rather spend the extra money knowing that my dog will be safer.<br /><br /><br />http://mcbrooklyn.blogspot.com/2008/07/dog-collapses-from-heat-stroke-on.html

			Oh, Buddy, that is horrible! Sometimes when we are gardening at St. Mark&#039;s on a hot day, we give passing dogs a drink. If anyone reads this who is walking their dog past St. Mark&#039;s on the 82nd Street side, there is a hose attached. If you feel your pet is distressed in any way, stop in and give it a drink or a hose down.<br /><br />I hope we see a posting that the dog was okay.

			That is definitely a shame. We leave the a/c on for our dog also, even if it&#039;s only set to 80 degrees, on a day like today it definitely still keeps the heat down.<br /><br />ECG, that&#039;s very handy. Thanks for the tip!

			Chuckster told me yesterday that someone in her building took her puppy out for a walk and when she came home the dog died from cardiac arrest!&nbsp; <br /><br />The other day I saw a guy jogging with dog.&nbsp; The dog&#039;s tongue was handing out and it didn&#039;t occur to me to say something.&nbsp; Now I think I will if I see something like that on a hot day.&nbsp; I know I didn&#039;t realize how very vulnerable dogs were in this heat.<br /><br />How sad to lose a dog like that.
