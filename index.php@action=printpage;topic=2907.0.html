				http://www.qgazette.com/news/2009/0610/features/007.html<br /><br />&quot;City Councilmember Helen Sears wants to make the quality of life for her fellow Jackson Heights residents as pleasant as possible. One way to achieve this goal, she says, is to create an area totally free of food vendors whose carts now crowd sidewalks and generally block access to streets.&quot;<br /><br />The area in question &quot;runs from 72nd Street and 35th Avenue and south to Roosevelt Avenue then extends east to 82nd Street on the north side of 37th Avenue and 78th Street on the south side.&quot;<br /><br />This would be a great shame. The food vendors are a valuable part of the community - and one of the reasons non-JH residents visit the neighborhood. <br /><br />I&#039;m a recent arrival in JH - and I&#039;d miss the food vendors if they were to be pushed out. I plan on contacting Sears&#039; office to voice my opinion. I hope others are inspired to do the same.

				i, too, am a big fan of street vendors. some of the best eats are sold on the streets of singapore. i do, however, as a new resident of jackson heights want to see this area improve and keep the streets clean. is there any open area venue where street carts can take residence and sell their street meat? i&#039;m not thinking of elaborate covered markets like in barcelona, rather smaller designated open areas accessible from the streets like in south london.

				I&#039;m no expert on this, but some of the vendors near the 74th Street train station look like they are selling food out of big garbage cans stuck in shopping carts.&nbsp; Is that up to health code?&nbsp; Do they have permits?&nbsp; Can it possibly be sanitary and healthy?&nbsp; But, on the other hand, they seem to have lots of steady customers, so I guess their food tastes good and is not killing anybody!

				As i understand it, this isn&#039;t the first time Ms Sears has proposed this. &nbsp;Not sure about past follow-up but there certainly wasn&#039;t any change in the past. &nbsp;Follow-up is key, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s her strong card.<br />I would like to see a proposal that would designate areas where vendors could serve their delights. &nbsp;The problem isn&#039;t with individual vendors, or the concept of street vendors itself, the problem is over-saturation in certain areas, traffic flow and safety. &nbsp;As to the sanitary concerns expressed below, I believe the Department of Health inspects vendors as it does other restaurants and cafes. &nbsp;If you see a problem, call it in.

				Here is an article from the champions of Quiet Enjoyment, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/orlick/3618383692/sizes/l/<br /><br />Helen Sears appears to be just like the rest of them, eschewing culture in favor of corporate developer revitalization. To get political, check out Tony Avella, his father was a hot dog vendor.

				One of the biggest draws for me when I moved to Jackson Heights was the restaurants &amp; food carts here &amp; in the surrounding area. I think that it&#039;s one of the many things that draw people to Jackson Heights, in fact last week getting on the Manhattan bound F from Roosevelt, I talked to some tourists from Germany who had specifically come out to Jackson Heights after hearing &amp; reading about all the food carts in the neighborhood. It adds character &amp; differentiation...if I had wanted to live in Park Slope, I would have done that. <br />Also, I don&#039;t know too much about Helen Sears but does she not realize the rich traditions of street food for immigrants&#039; in their country of origin? It seems like this is almost an attack on immigrant businesses, but hey what do I know?

				We keep saying &quot;If I wanted to live in Park Slope....&quot; because some of us had a choice. <br />These people obviously wanted to live in park slope but couldn&#039;t afford the rent. Or just didn&#039;t come for the culture. She lost my vote.

				I really don&#039;t understand this proposal at all...most (all?) of the street carts are within a block or two of the subway stations, and not setting up in the middle of the historic residential district.&nbsp; I live right smack in the middle of the carts, and many people in my large building (including myself) degrade our health with street cart food all the time.&nbsp; Can I really call 311 and tell them how much I love Samy&#039;s halal or the woman selling tamales out of a shopping cart on 74th and Roosevelt?<br /><br />Maybe one doesn&#039;t want to dredge up old arguments about immigrants, historic district, etc...but come on!&nbsp; Helen Sears is a politician trying to win an election, and thus is making this proposal to curry favor with a certain portion of the electorate (i.e. those that complain about street carts and would welcome a draconian solution).

				i have lived in the historic district for the better part of 15 years -- moved from astoria shortly after it was created -- and for the first ten or eleven of those years, no one complained about street vendors or anything so benign. i believe any class/cultural warfare is largely the product of individuals who have moved into the area ans said -- to appropriate the title of a less-than-wonderful play, &quot;I love you, you&#039;re perfect, now change.&quot; <br /><br />i adore the products from the carts and I adore the proprietors of the ones i patronize, so perhaps i am biased. but if i may ask, which carts in particular have greatly impeded your walking? and which ones have clients that litter? if the latter is to be taken into account, i&#039;d say the worst offender is mcdonald&#039;s.....sorry if any of this sounds petty or accusatory. i would simply prefer to maintain the character of a neighborhood i have loved since before i moved into it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=2907.msg19499.html#msg19499">Quote from: StevenGrey on June 18, 2009, 03:10:55 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Let&#039;s <em>please</em> not turn this thread into another potboiler discussion about the immigrant community in Jackson Heights, or an attack on the people who live in the historic district (like myself) who just want to keep their streets clean, quiet, and uncongested.

				I&#039;m not opposed to the carts, though I will say as a general rule I do not patronize street vendors, particularly when it comes to food. I felt the need to speak out because I felt that some of the posts in this thread were attacking newer residents of the historic district unfairly by siting them as the root cause for Ms. Sears&#039; position on this issue. You seem to agree with that viewpoint, which is your prerogative.<br /><br />As for the second part of your reply, you are undoubtedly biased if you don&#039;t think the sidewalks on Roosevelt Avenue are too crowded and filthy to easily navigate as a pedestrian. And no, this is not <em>just</em> because of the food vendors, but their presence <em>does</em> compound the problem. The carts in front of the subway station/bus terminal always create an obstacle, particularly during the evening rush hours. There is often some liquid on the sidewalks by the food vendors, whether it is melted ice, discarded washwater, or spilled beverages and condiments. (I&#039;ll add that I don&#039;t particularly care for the noise or smell that emanates from the portable generators some of the carts use either.) And it&#039;s hard to deny that they don&#039;t bare any responsibility for the litter problem when you examine what&#039;s often found lying on the streets.<br /><br />That being said, I do not support a &quot;draconian&quot; solution but neither do I think it&#039;s unreasonable to require the vendors to relocate their carts during busier times of the day. This is what is often done in Manhattan... Vendors must move from the avenues to the side streets at particular hours.

				thanks for a civilized and thought out reply.<br /><br />i don&#039;t imagine we will find a place of agreement here, but that&#039;s the way things sometimes go. i&#039;ve eaten at street vendors for at least 40 years (i&#039;m 43 and my mom got me hooked on them) and as a life long inner city resident, i&#039;ve always found that the best stuff and the best service comes from individual proprietors/carts/guys selling services on their own. but i digress.<br /><br />moving to a side street is a potential compromise, and not that inconvenient since these are mobile operations, but losing them altogether would be awful. and in terms of litter? i see candy wrappers, chip bags, condoms, mcdonalds stuff and gum way more often than i see corn husks, radish pieces, onions or other evidence of cart effluvia. maybe i am cursed with selective eyesight.<br /><br />thanks again for keeping this talk on topic

I&#039;m a &quot;newer resident of the historic district&quot; and I didn&#039;t feel attacked. But I like and patronize many of the vendors, so ymmv.<br /><br />I find that even in neighborhoods where there are few street vendors and thriving, (gentrified) businesses under the trains, it still tends to be a rather gross area (I&#039;m thinking of 31st Street in Astoria) just by virtue of being under the train. I would think if there was a concerted effort to finish the train station, rather than just&nbsp; the temporary, wobbly plywood that&#039;s there now, the 74th Station area would look 10x better even with the vendors.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve lived in JH for over 20 years and have never eaten from the food carts (where &quot;DO&quot; these guys wash their hands). When I first moved here over 20 years ago, there weren&#039;t many at all. In fact the proliferation of these vendors is a rather new phenomena, true New Yorkers cashing in on the &quot;ethnic&quot; vibe of the neighborhood. I am, however, especially opposed to them being placed on 37th Ave. The sidewalks are too narrow and crowded as it is. Several stores who illegally place their merchandise outside add to the conjestion and chaos. There should&nbsp; be a limited number allowed and they should be restricted to a specific area. They should regularly be inspected by the Dept Of Health as well. At the end of the day, I think Helen Sears should be doing more about the guys selling Chicas, Chicas and Social, Social on Roosevelt ave.

				i admire your optimism in thinking that having a place for hand washing means that hand washing is going on :)<br /><br />but since there don&#039;t seem to be many -- or, shall i say, ANY -- food vendors on 37th (aside from the hot dog guy at 82nd), i see that as a bit of a red herring.<br /><br />and heck, 13 false identities is an inalienable right...social...papers ...oy!

				Conversely not all newer residents (like myself) are in full support of the street vendors.<br /><br />I would personally prefer that they be reduced in number.<br /><br />The veiled insinuation that an objection to these vendors is racially-based is a pretty ridiculous dodge around the real issues brought up further up in the thread.

				Anyone else catch the segment on NY1 about the food cart vendors on Roosevelt Ave? Seemed like they are trying to ban them in some areas. Lots of vocal protest from the vendors. Personally, as a resident of JH for 20 years, id like to see most of them gone. Seemed like their biggest argument was that whoever doesn&#039;t want them is a racist according to most of the speakers. With so many different nationalities living amongst us, i think it would be pretty hard to live here and be a racist. It disturbs me when they use that as an excuse to get their way.<br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; Similar topics merged.]</strong>

				This topic has been discussed here recently:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2907.0 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2907.0)<br /><br />Many, many food cart lovers in JH.&nbsp; And just browse Chowhound.com to see how many people come to JH and surrounding neighborhoods to explore the culinary wonderland of the carts!&nbsp; I had the squash blossom quesadilla from the cart in front of Coral Aquarium on Roosevelt Ave last weekend after being out of town for 10 days...delicious!
