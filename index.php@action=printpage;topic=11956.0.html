				I know, heretical question, but one to which I&#039;ve recently been giving some serious thought.&nbsp; My family loves this neighborhood, but if prices continue rising the way they have for the past couple years, we won&#039;t be able to make the leap from renting to owning. That&#039;s not a complaint, just a fact. I&#039;m sure we&#039;re not the only ones.<br />These are the things I love about JH: 1) Diverse mix of ethnicities, education, life experiences 2) Concentration of professionals in creative and education fields 3) Lots of families 4) Active and expanding venues for civic engagement 5) Walkability &amp; access to public transportation<br />I&#039;d love to hear suggestions for neighborhoods that have some of these Jackson Heights-ish virtues but are more affordable. Norwood, in the Bronx, is one I&#039;ve been exploring recently. For now we&#039;re interested in staying in NYC, but are open to other suggestions (Pittsburgh? Poughkeepsie?)<br />Thanks guys.

				Great question. I&#039;d also like to know the answer as I&#039;m trying to sell my apartment and get a bigger space for my family. Much of JH seems to be beyond our budget :-(. We&#039;ve looked at places in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx and nowhere seems to match JH in terms of good schools, transit access (trains + thoroughfares for driving), and size of apartments (including architectural details!). We looked at Fieldston/Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx for a while, but since we can&#039;t pay up for private school, the lack of transit and expensive housing made it less than appealing. <br /><br />At this point we&#039;re pretty committed to staying in Queens. We checked out Ridgewood too, but...meh. Still on the hunt!

				&nbsp;There are areas of Phila that if you are a bit of a pioneer, you can buy a row house for about $60,000. <br />The city is on an upswing and there are lot&#039;s of young people, diversity, history and great food and<br />music when you look for it. Cons are that the schools are very problematic though and racial divides <br />can be more obvious/severe than in NYC. Crime is a major issue in some areas though blocks tend<br />to police themselves alot. You could have a yard though and be a home owner and be part of renewing<br />your community.

				JH is still a relative bargain compared to the rest of NYC for what you get, the amenities, transportation, and safety.<br /><br />There are even more bargains to be had if you look into the Post War buildings. 2 bedrooms for under 250k.<br />

				If you are willing to go a bit further afield, the mid-Hudson valley -- starting in Northern Westchester and going up to about Poughkeepsie -- is generally affordable and there are some interesting, attractive and fairly lively towns along the Metro North line (which by the way has to be ranked among the most beautiful train rides in the countryâ€¦)&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for space and room to grow, while still maintaining some connection to NYC, there are a lot of possibilities in that area.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Looking at the map, Norwood in the Bronx seems interesting. I wouldn&#039;t be able to stomach moving to Brooklyn, I would feel like a traitor if I did right now.... I know I&#039;m not permanent in my current place, but where would I go if I had to move out? Selling would be good, but then I&#039;d have to buy.... <br />The only other cities I&#039;d like to live right now are Baltimore and LA. <br /><br /><br />Oh, I love Corona. If I didn&#039;t have to take the subway, I&#039;d love to move there. I just cruised down 103rd Street and really liked it over there.

				If I was magically given a ridiculous amount of money, I would buy an entire brownstone in either Gramercy Park, Park Slope, or Greenpoint. One that included a garage. <br />After the monkeys finish flying out of my butt and I wake up, I would consider Portland, Oregon. It&#039;s relatively affordable compared to NYC and my wife has a lot of family there.

				I have been hearing more about areas in the Bronx like Pelham Parkway, Bedford Park and Morris Park.&nbsp; Sometimes it can be worthwhile checking out past columns of &quot;The Hunt&quot; in the NY Times to try to discover some new areas.&nbsp; Usually they include a slide show and some average home/coop prices.

				If in the same situation, I would give Union City/West New York a look.&nbsp; We have family over there and have been there quite a bit.<br /><br />First, I like the feel of the neighborhood.&nbsp; Its about a mile wide from the Hudson River to the edge of the Palisades, so you are never that far from the waterfront.&nbsp; Its built to human scale, very walkable and pleasant.&nbsp; The structures remind me a good deal of Williamsburg, most of it pre-war, though it doesn&#039;t have as much of an industrial feel to it.<br /><br />Second, I like the commercial area, centered along Bergenline Avenue which runs up its spine.&nbsp; I go there to buy my linen clothing and love eating in the restaurants there (for the most authentic Cuban pastels north of Miami, goto Grand Via on 48th Street.&nbsp; Shamelessly cheap and shamelessly delicious).&nbsp; The commercial feel represents the neighborhood, which is much more Spanish orientated than JH east of 76th Street.&nbsp; A lot of shops do require a certain comfort with Spanish, which may be a sticking point for some, but for a silly monoglot like me, I sort of revel in it.<br /><br />Third, I like the potential of the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was once a huge Cuban community, but much of that has been replaced by folks from other remnants of the Spanish Empire.&nbsp; That means that the housing prices are affordable (except along the water).&nbsp; Given its proximity to NYC, I can see home values going up in price in the semi-near future.&nbsp; Not having a direct subway connection makes this more difficult, but the bus service to the city is quick, cheap and frequent.&nbsp; The Hudson Bergen Light Rail does connect you quickly to Hoboken and from there the PATH gets you into the city.&nbsp; Overall, I can definitely see a good investment being made with a property purchase in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for other things, like the schools and crime, I cannot speak with too much certainty.&nbsp; My nephew went to the schools there and liked it.&nbsp; Crime in West New York used to be problematic, but from what I understand, its much more under control, much as some NYC neighborhoods.<br /><br />Either way, good luck with your searching.<br /><br />

				in my years here, I&#039;ve lived (in more or less chronological order)<br /><br />lower east side (1981-1984)<br />bed stuy (1984-5)<br />greenpoint (1986-87)<br />Flatbush (1988-89)<br />Astoria (1990-1995)<br /><br />before moving to Jackson heights<br /><br />while I enjoyed the earliest places, rats, landlords setting arson fires and junkies dying in the hall were minor inconveniences that would be a bit too much at my age :)<br /><br />honestly, the quality of life, quality of housing and such around here are the best I can think of. maybe parts of park slope have appeal (with unlimited funds, one of those brownstones would be amazing). places like bayside, I just don&#039;t get. I&#039;ve never lived in the suburbs (grew up in an urban, industrial neighborhood) and I don&#039;t find anything appealing about a neighborhood that mimics them. a rural enclave on the east end of the north fork, maybe. the suburbs? not for me.

				If you are open to suburbs then you have many choices as they are not congested like the city. To choose the right suburb you need to take into account where your job is. A suburb that satisfies all your desirables is Montclair. NJ. You can find huge beautiful historic houses for less than 600K and depending where you live it is walkable and may use only public transportation. It&#039;s diverse, liberal, family oriented and full of creatives.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an example (I am no way associated with montclair or the seller!--just an example)<br /><br />http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/211-Watchung-Ave-Montclair-NJ-07043/38688904_zpid/

				The taxes for that place are over $17,000 a year! Between that and a mortgage you&#039;re pushing $4,000/month before insurance, repairs, etc.<br />I can&#039;t see how anyone could afford that but not afford Jackson Heights, which is still an amazingly affordable place.

First you will pay $5000/year property taxes in JH. Second, you will pay city income tax which is 3.5% which on an income of 150K is another $5000/year. Third the school system in Montclair is great their schools dwarf anything you have seen in JH. So you pay $7000/year for great schools all way to high school for any number of kids. You also get to enjoy the beautiful house and yard and avoid the JH crowds and absence of parks. If you can stand the longer commute then cities like montclair are the obvious choice.<br />

My point was more that once someone has kids and needs more than 1-bedroom, it is pretty tough to afford, especially considering coops tend to have 20% down payment rules. Someone making an &quot;ok&quot; salary for NYC - let&#039;s say 85K, couldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; They could probably get approved for a 1-bedroom but that&#039;s about it.&nbsp; That&#039;s when I can see why people would move to NJ or somewhere that prices are still high but at least you get a yard and three bedrooms. <br /><br />I think my view is skewed because I got sucked into watching House Hunters when visiting my mom and kept getting jealous when I saw what&#039;s out there for what my 1-bedroom here will cost.&nbsp; If I felt I would never want to leave NYC than Jackson Heights is an ideal area for me and I agree it&#039;s probably the most reasonable area in the city. But I only moved back to NYC reluctantly (for a job) and am trying decide if I should buy here or move on. I feel handcuffed by my salary.&nbsp; I&#039;d kill to move back to where I grew up - the North Fork of LI but it&#039;s too expensive and there are no jobs there doing what I do for a living.&nbsp;

				We bought in JH 3 years ago after searching pretty far and wide within NYC for affordability paired with an easy commute and good quality of life/good quality apartment. We wanted 2 bedrooms and 2 baths and the only place we could find an apartment that size plus all of the above for the $400s or lower (our price range) was in JH. <br /><br />We wound up buying on the upper end of that price range, but we could have paid 100K less for an apartment only a half block from where we wound up. (We just liked the more expensive place much better for a number of reasons.) <br /><br />Still--JH really was extremely affordable. In Brooklyn to get a place that size for that price would have entailed being much farther from the subway, having just one train line, etc. The only other area that was cheaper for that size apartment was Riverdale in the Bronx. You can get a lot of space up there for a very low price. ($200s-$300s for large 2 bed/2 bath.) However, the maintenance fees were generally a lot higher in Riverdale plus the commute much harder. <br /><br />So we chose JH and are very glad we did. We did look in Montclair in a brief attempt to consider moving out of the city.&nbsp; We were warned (by someone who reluctantly left Montclair for that reason) that taxes are very high in Montclair as in a lot of N Jersey, (see comment above: 17K vs 5K in JH) and when you add up higher commuting costs, the need for one or two cars, costs for lawn maintenance, roof and water heater repairs, etc, you don&#039;t really save money by moving to Montclair. And don&#039;t kid yourself, the schools in these suburbs are not always what they are cracked up to beâ€”I have heard from friends and colleagues. When you stay in the city, you have more choices. In the &#039;burbs you are limited to whatever is there. I have friends who hightailed it back to NYC after several years in Hastings because they found that the schools there really did not suit their kids. Another friend wound up bussing her child back to a special school in NYC every day when the Chappaqua schools could not handle her special needs. So my friend was paying those enormous taxes and not even using the schools. <br /><br />Basically you have to do a lot of research and figure out what your priorities are. If you want to pay a lot less for your apartment/house, you will probably be in a worse commuting situation. For example, we chose to pay 100K more to be 13 blocks closer to the express train than a beautiful, completely renovated apartment we also considered. To us, that was worth it. I also know people who stuck it out in their tiny Manhattan stabilized rental with 2 kids so they could go to great NYC public schools and be in walking distance. But really, bottom line, JH is still one of the more affordable areas in the city that is also very well connected via 5 subways lines. And here, there are some 1 bedrooms that really are large enough to make into 2 bedrooms. Plus maintenance fees tend to be on the low side compared to other neighborhoods. I&#039;d say you should look very hard here before giving up on finding something that works.

				Well I remember being accused of being a real estate agent and worse once because of some comments I made about wanting more variety of restaurants in the neighborhood.

				Back to the topic!<br /><br />When I was buying a coop in Jackson Heights as couple of years ago, it was not an easy choice. The price of 2bedroom 2bath apartments near the express subway was not that affordable, the price at that time was almost the same as Forest Hills. The walking to/from express subway station was very unpleasant, especially the bad smell in the summer . <br /><br />Anyway, if not in Jackson Heights, I probably would live in Forest Hills.

				I guess if I could afford a place in the old/fancy part of Forest Hills, there are some nice buildings there. But when we looked there, we felt more like we were on Long Island and less that we lived in the city. JH was much more of an urban neighborhood feel to us.

The 7 train is probably more tolerable from Sunnyside than it is from Jackson Heights as there are fewer stops into the city. I&#039;ve definitely had more problems with the 7 train than other trains in the neighborhood. Considering I take it the least out of the trains and I experience the most problems with it, I have to question Straphangers grading system. When the 7 train is not working, it is nice to be able to walk downstairs and take a different train.<br /><br />Sunnyside is a nice neighborhood, but I still choose Jackson Heights. <br /><br />One area that I&#039;ve explored more this summer than in past years is the Rockaways from around the Cross Bay Bridge west to Ft. Tilden. There&#039;s a lot of nice things happening there with new and better restaurants and bars, etc. Very different than just a few years back. I&#039;m not sure what it would be like to live there year round. It is definitely lacking many of the conveniences that we take for granted in JH, such as the wide variety of places to shop for groceries. Definitely a horrible commute if you have to get to Manhattan each day, but a great commute to the beach! I&#039;ve definitely had the, &quot;could I live here?&quot; thought cross my mind while there, but this may be the result of too much sun after a day at the beach.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to stay in JH for the foreseeable future.

				One area I don&#039;t see mentioned here is Bensonhurst and its environs.&nbsp; I actually regret not looking there as well when I moved to JH.&nbsp; I like the restaurant choices better and the commute would be much easier for me. Housing prices are very similar to JH - and I&#039;d love to live near L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens! It&#039;s one of my all-time favorite pizza places.&nbsp; My friend&#039;s 2-bedroom has a view of the bay and is pre-war and huge. Oh, and the building has a nice pool!&nbsp; He pays $2100 a month - which I think is quite close to what a 2-bedroom goes for around here.&nbsp; Condo/coops are reasonable as well.&nbsp; I have no idea about the schools - it&#039;s a non-issue for me.

				Bensonhurst is a nice area, but the main negative for me is the distance from manhattan. it&#039;s a lot longer commute and i can&#039;t even imagine the cab price for the rare nights when i would take that route home (it&#039;s about 20 bucks for me on a late night, either down northern from midtown or over the williamsburg from downtown). i also find this to be a better looking/more pleasant neighborhood in general...but L &amp; B is most definitely a selling point (as is the growing Chinatown).

All I can see now is over $350k and $400k. <br />

				For affordable, decent housing still within city limits, what about southeast Queens? Places like St. Albans, Queens Village-- middle class neighborhoods that were hit hard in the 80&#039;s and later by the foreclosure crisis, but may be on the upswing now.<br />Trulia is full of listings for single- and double-family homes in St. Albans, many of them under $300,000. You don&#039;t have anywhere near the convenience of Jackson Heights, but there is the LIRR and J train.<br />Thoughts?

				Part of the southeast Queens issue is the chronic flooding and the high number of illegally converted houses.&nbsp; The second one may not be a big deal for some people, but the flooding is an issue for many. Until that issue is sorted out, caveat emptor.&nbsp;

				Ah, good point about the flooding Brook Lynn. And in general, lt&#039;s easy to romanticize having your own house, until you realize what a great deal of work it is to maintain one...
