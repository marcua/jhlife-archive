				Our grass is getting very costly and time consuming. We had to replace it&nbsp; with sod numerous times and have tried everything to keep it looking lush and healthy.&nbsp; It ends up drying up and dying. We water and treat it and have reseeded spots etc. I would love to pave it. Has anyone done this? any advice? I would like to do it myself to keep cost down. Is home depot a good place for the materials? thanks

				its in the backyard and its not the whole yard. I have beautiful plants/shrubs/roses/tomatoes etc around the perimeter. I&#039;ve been looking online and think we are going to go with some recyled materials.

				If you mean recylcled materials like crushed stone, I think that&#039;s a much better alternative than paving.&nbsp; <br /><br />Check out this site for an idea about what crushed stone looks like<br />http://www.uri.edu/ce/healthylandscapes/davisville2.html#jdpermpav<br /><br />There are probably many other (better) sites for photos as well.<br /><br />or how about something like this?<br />(http://pinnaclepavingstone.com/images/placeholder.jpg)

I rather look at a garden over a slab of cement any day. You are talking about your front yard right? well unless you plan on making a driveway then it serves no purpose really.<br /><br />You need a hose end sprayer, 1 can of beer,some mouthwash and some dish washing soap. Do a google search on lawn tonics. I am going to try this myself once I buy the hose end sprayer. I spread some ironite lawn fertilizer last week,been watering it every night since and my new sod(about 2 months since I layed it down)is mainly brown. I had to go to Lowes in Brooklyn to buy that 1 small bag,lack of rain surely is a problem.

				I have a small weekend house and my back yard has mature, raised perennial beds/trees/flowers etc.&nbsp; But my walkways and everything between the beds are small stones, slate walking paths or recessed bricks.&nbsp; Sounds like a lots going on but it&#039;s very, very lovely.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to upload a photo here.&nbsp; If not, private message me and I&#039;ll email you photos.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Crushed stone looks great but I am sure it&#039;s not a do it yourself job. You need a landscaper or<br />even a stone mason for the job to be done properly. The thing with sod is that it needs a lot of<br />water. I know your frustration because sod is costly and the install takes a lot of work.<br /><br />Funny thing is the day after I had put down the sod,people commented on how great it looked,I told them but in a few weeks it will be as brown as a desert. We have to pay for water usage and I am not going to water a small strip of sod(by the curb)like crazy and have higher water bills.

				Buddy that is beautiful!!!! <br />Its for my backyard so if someone is not happy looking out their back window so be it. Im a big nature lover but after spending thousands on a small patch of grass, I am done!! Like snickers we purchased sod and it dried up. We were not neglectful and take pride in our garden. I think it might be a soil problem and frankly I&#039;m tired of dealing with it. I was thinking recycled rubber pavers and making a nice design.

				A friend of mine used rubber mulch.&nbsp; He likes it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not familiar with it so I can&#039;t comment personally.&nbsp; I like the crushed stone but you still have to either weed or spray week killer.&nbsp; But I love the beachy look of it and I hate cutting grass.<br /><br />I wished my photos were larger.&nbsp; I can&#039;t figure out the right size.

				thanks Shelby.&nbsp; I use TinyPic website and choose the message board size (640x480).&nbsp; They do have the size you suggested so I&#039;ll try that one next time.
