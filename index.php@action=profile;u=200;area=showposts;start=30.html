Starting at 5PM, for a low price you will be able to feed 2-3 adults, or a family of 4 or 5 people.<br /><br />This week our delicious menu will feature a pimento cheese dip, crackers and crudités as a first course, followed by a fragrant, savory, sweet, spiced chicken stew, all for $45!<br /><br />If you want to not worry about cooking on Sunday evening, please <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-11-03&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a>, and we look forward to seeing you at The Q!<br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_d07306a7f5cd4f0d868011b3e5599df4~mv2.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Upcoming Events</strong></span><br /><br /><strong>Today is Halloween!</strong> We love Halloween, who doesn&#039;t love Halloween?!

If you come in costume to dine or have a drink, simply have your picture taken at our spooky corner, and at 9PM our expert panel of seasoned professionals will decide the best kids costume and the best adult costume!<br /><br /><strong>NEXT THURSDAY IS ED FUQUA DAY!</strong><br /><br />Starting at around 8:30PM, come listen to some of the finest jazz around as Ed joins us with a trio! These guys are true artists, their music is a joy to listen to and we consider ourselves lucky that they are able to play at The Q.<br /><br />On a sadder note, this is Ed&#039;s last gig with us. He is moving away. Why would anybody move away from NYC? We don&#039;t understand that, but we secretly hope he has a difficult time not being close to any subways, and he moves back before we know it!<br /><br /><strong>SOLAR HAPPY HOUR: THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14th, 6:30-8:30</strong><br /><br />Come to the Jackson Heights Goes Solar happy hour.

We&#039;re delighted to team up with Shenanigans NY tomorrow to bring our weekly board gaming night to The Queensboro!<br /><br />Every Wednesday, at 6:30 we&#039;re turning the restaurant into a board gamer&#039;s paradise! About 50 games will be available to play - from the classics, to some of the newest games just released from the best designers on Kickstarter. This is a very family-friendly event, but we&#039;ve also had people show up alone, or as a couple, and they had a great time.<br /><br />The awesome folks at Shenanigans will be there to guide you through the rules of any game you might be unfamiliar with, or to match you up with potential partners. There will be discounts and raffles and it&#039;s a fantastic opportunity to make some new friends, bond with some old ones, or simply bring the whole family and enjoy an evening of gaming and good food.<br /><br />You can <a href="https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">register for this event right here</a>! <br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Thursday, 8:30 - George Papageorge and friends!</span></strong><br /><br />George Papageorge is one of the finest blues and jazz keyboard players, he lives right here in Jackson Heights and we&#039;re lucky enough to have him and his pals play at The Q from time to time. It&#039;s a wonderful show, the music is great and we love having them play here.<br /><br />If you&#039;re free, swing by for a drink, or if you also want to have a meal, then if you <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-24&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a> it would be just swell!<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Sunday - Pau Hana at The Queensboro</span></strong><br /><br />This coming Sunday our Sunday Supper will be slightly different. Join <a href="http://www.halawai.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Halawai</a> for some kanikapila, ʻono food and a fun time at The Queensboro. There will be music, dancing and lots of that loving, unique Hawaiian vibe! We&#039;ll feature a special menu with Hawaiian offerings by Chef Tony.<br /><br />It will take place from 5-7PM, but if you can&#039;t make it that early, don&#039;t worry - we&#039;ll make sure to keep the delicious food available all night!<br /><br />You can - and should - <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-27&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">reserve for this event right here</a>!<br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_c46b85e16b19461c8b0f29694fb49d89~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" />

We&#039;re partnering with Shenanigans NY for a weekly Board Gaming session at The Queensboro, starting tomorrow, Wednesday the 16th of October at 6:30. <br /><br />We&#039;re turning the restaurant into a board gamer&#039;s paradise! About 50 games will be available to play - from the classics, to some of the newest games just released from the best designers on Kickstarter.<br /><br />We&#039;ll have experts on hand to guide you through the rules of any game you might be unfamiliar with or match you up with potential partners. There will be discounts and raffles and it&#039;s a fantastic opportunity to make some new friends, bond with some old ones, or simply bring the whole family and enjoy an evening of gaming and good food.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">You can register for this event right here!</a><br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_51fc982541c34d199a67194545583e44~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_600,h_775,al_c,lg_1/crop/x_0,y_0,w_600,h_738/image.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" />

They played for Saint Patrick&#039;s Day this year and they were a lot of fun, everyone loved them and we&#039;ve had a lot of requests to get them to come back, so we jumped at the chance to book them again.<br /><br />This Saturday get ready to rock out to some awesome Irish music at The Queensboro. It&#039;s very family-friendly so feel free to bring your kids and hang out in the afternoon, we&#039;ll be serving food at 4 and the drinks will certainly be flowing!<br /><br />They&#039;ve been described as &quot;What the Ramones might have sounded like if they’d taken traditional Irish music as their starting point&quot;, which is very high praise in this neck of the woods!

					<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Dear friends and neighbors, we have so many things happening at The Queensboro, we&#039;re bursting with excitement!<br /><br />First of all, we hope that everyone is enjoying Annabelle Popa&#039;s gorgeous art that is on the walls of the restaurant. Our eternal gratitude to <a href="http://www.helenquinnnyc.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Helen Quinn</a> for allowing us to feature her work for so long. If you&#039;re interested in purchasing any of Annabelle&#039;s work, or one of her prints check out <a href="https://www.annabellepopa.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">her website</a> and see what strikes your fancy!<br /><br />Our Beer &amp; Cheese tasting with <a href="https://www.standalonecheese.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Stand Alone Cheese</a> is taking place tomorrow, and - as careful readers of our messages will know - it is sold out! This encouraged us to add another night of Beer &amp; Cheese on the following Tuesday!<br /><br />So join us on Tuesday October 1st at 8:30PM to check out 5 beers and 5 cheeses with Steffen from Stand Alone Cheese. When you <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-01&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a>, be sure to say &quot;CHEESE&quot; in the notes to let us know you&#039;re booking for this event!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Ed Fuqua &amp; Jim Hershman Perform on Thursday</strong></span><br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_13b2f42ae65c481da14b411049d449be~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />We&#039;ve said it before and it bears repeating - when Ed and Jim play together, musical sparks fly! These guys are some of the best around, we consider ourselves to be lucky that they play at The Q, if you haven&#039;t heard them before you really owe it to yourself to come and check them out.<br /><br />Sadly, Ed is leaving us for a land that isn&#039;t accessible by subway (somewhere in the blurry expanses west of the Hudson) and this might be his final performance at The Q! We hope to sneak in one more show but we can&#039;t make any promises so please come by and say hi and hear him and Jim play, it truly is some of the most beautiful music around.<br /><br />Reward yourself and <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-26&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Oktoberfest!</strong></span><br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_034d83cdf102425da844142704597208~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Everybody knows that Oktoberfest starts in September (actually we had no idea!), so last weekend we were more than ready to start serving liter steins of a gorgeous Oktoberfest beer from Jack&#039;s Abbey, and some of the most delicious bratwurst in pretzel bread with sauerkraut, double mustard, and Swiss cheese we&#039;ve ever tasted! Oktoberfest continues for another 2 weeks or so, which gives you plenty of time to swing by and enjoy some proper German delights! The mug in the above photograph is about a foot tall, which gives you an idea of the size of the dish next to it. Not insubstantial!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Irishfest!</strong></span><br /><br />Do you remember Saint Patrick&#039;s day weekend? We often don&#039;t, but this year we do because we were lucky enough to have <a href="https://www.prodigals.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The Prodigals</a> perform at The Q, and they were so much fun we&#039;re excited to welcome them back this coming weekend!<br /><br />On Saturday at 3:30PM get ready to rock out to some awesome Irish music at The Queensboro. They&#039;ve been described as &quot;What the Ramones might have sounded like if they’d taken traditional Irish music as their starting point&quot; - which sounds pretty cool to us!</span></span><br /><br />See you at The Q!

					<strong>Aged Salice Salentino!</strong><br /><br />This week we are featuring a dynamic red from Puglia (the heel of Italy’s boot). Cosimo Taurino’s family has been making wines using the ancient grapes of southern Italy for seven generations. His Salice Salentino is made from a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia, which is aged at the winery until it is ready to drink.<br /><br />The “current” vintage is from 2010 and shows a wonderful balance of earthy, spicy and fruit flavors. It&#039;s a wonderful opportunity to savor a wine that has been allowed to properly age, a luxury which has disappeared for most wine drinkers in our modern age.<br /><br />The Queensboro will be featuring the 2010 Salice Salentino by the glass starting Wednesday night. Because of its balance, it matches a range of food - pizza, burgers, pastas- but we especially like it with Chef Tony’s Double-Cut Pork Chop with grilled peaches… delish! Come on down and try and glass- we love it and think you will too!<br /><br />Not only are we offering this wine by the glass today, but if you get a bottle we&#039;ll knock 25% off the price, and as the Italians from Puglia say, <em>&quot;that&#039;s a heel of a deal!&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>Thursday at 8:30 - the Teej Trio perform!</strong><br /><br />We have another new local band for everyone to enjoy this Thursday!<br /><br />TJ Adorno is a local guitarist and song writer from Jackson Heights, Queens. He has been active throughout New York&#039;s creative music scene since 2014, performing in genres such as: Jazz, Hip-Hop, Neo Soul, Rock, and more. Also known as TEEJ, he is the frontman and band leader of his projects The SidePocket and TeeJ Tr3o. For more information, booking, or other inquiries, visit teejmusic.com.<br /><br />Fancy checking them out? <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-19&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Make a reservation</a>!<br /><br /><strong>Even more events!<br /></strong><br />We&#039;re always busy at The Q coming up with fun stuff, new food and great drinks. We will go into more details another time but here&#039;s a sneak peek at some upcoming events:<br /><br />Friday - Gallery Opening for the awesome Annabel Poppa, from 6-9PM<br /><br />This weekend - the start of Oktoberfest!<br /><br />Tuesday - A Cheese &amp; Beer night with Stand Alone Cheese Shop!<br /><br />Next Thursday - The inimitable Ed Fuqua and Jim Hershman perform!

We’re always excited when cool new neighbors move in, so we were really thrilled when Steffen Kenney opened <a href="https://www.standalonecheese.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Stand Alone Cheese</a> in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />This gem of a store not only sells some amazing cheeses, but also has bread (some of it from the baked-at-the-Q Little Wildbranch Bakery), charcuterie, ice cream, exotic canned goods, a friendly approachable attitude and much more!<br /><br />We want you to meet these guys, so we’re hosting a Stand Alone Cheese Night here at The Queensboro.<br /><br />On Tuesday, September 24th at 8:30pm, Steffen will lead a curated tasting of fine cheeses from his shop, each paired with some of our fresh, delicious beers. Five cheeses, five beers and lots of wisdom, all for $25 per person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seating will be limited so we <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-24&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">strongly recommend booking in advance</a>.<br /><br />Leave us a note saying &quot;CHEESE!&quot; in the reservation so we know you&#039;re booking a space for this event.<br /><br />If you can’t make the tasting, fear not! We’ll be offering a Stand Alone Cheese plate the rest of the week (or until it sells out).&nbsp; What’s more all of the cheeses from the tasting are available for purchase at Stand Alone Cheese, 79-07 37th Avenue.<br /><br /><strong>A little more about Steffen:</strong><br /><br />Steffen&#039;s journey into the world of cheese began 20 years ago, as a student in Philadelphia. A part-time job at Downtown Cheese in the Reading Terminal Market turned into a full-time passion. Steffen was drawn to the diversity of cheeses from around the world and the stories behind them. He enjoyed how discussions about cheese often transformed into conversations about life.<br /><br />After moving to New York, Steffen work at local institutions Ideal Cheese and Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro. He also guided food and beer tours throughout the city. Steffen dreamed of opening a shop in Queens to provide quality cheese and specialty products to an underserved part of the city.<br /><br />When his friends at <a href="https://tablewine-ny.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Table Wine</a>&nbsp; encouraged him to check out 37th Avenue, Steffen knew that he had found just the place: an amazing community hungry for cheese, and on June 1, 2019, he opened Stand Alone Cheese in Jackson Heights.[/size]

					<strong>$10 Pizza Today For Mets Fans!</strong><br /><br />Come Watch the All Star Game with us at 7:30!<br /><br />Mets fans rejoice! After Pete Alonso&#039;s win yesterday in the Home Rub Derby he&#039;ll be fired up to play alongside his colleagues Jacob DeGrom and Jeff McNeil tonight at 7:30, and we are so fired up about this that we&#039;re going to be offering $10 pizzas all night to anyone wearing their Mets gear, so come by and say hi to us tonight!<br />&nbsp;<br />You could also <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-07-09&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a> to make sure you get a good seat. <br /><br /><strong>Wino Wednesday Continues!</strong><br /><br />Everyone loves a cool glass of white or rosé on a summer day, but have you thought about switching it up with a chilled summer red wine?&nbsp; Cooler temperatures accentuate the wine’s natural fruit profile while tamping down the alcohol.&nbsp; It&#039;s perfect with pizza or grilled meats or just to quaff with some small nibbles, all while keeping your cool. <br />&nbsp;<br />We’re pouring a lovely Dolcetto with a nice chill this summer at The Queensboro and on Wino Wednesday this week, we’ll be offering it will a cool price tag as well - $6 a glass all night long. Its a chance to try something new and maybe put a different tint on your summer wine drinking.<br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/799dfeebbb2d4f87ad31e6c6ac03b9ca.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_493,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/799dfeebbb2d4f87ad31e6c6ac03b9ca.webp" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />&nbsp;<br />Cheers!<br /><br /><strong>Jazz on Thursday and Sunday!</strong><br /><br />We are looking forward to more excellent jazz this week with two big events!<br />&nbsp;<br />First, consider joining us on Thursday at 8PM to check out the Jon Menges Trio bring it with some fantastic jazz tunes for a couple of sets. We&#039;re delighted to have them play with us again.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then, on Sunday, we will close out the Jackson Heights Jazz Festival with a performance by The Ed Fuqua Trio at 8PM! We could say that it&#039;s worth coming for this just to see Ed&#039;s gorgeous custom bass but that wouldn&#039;t do justice to the talent that he brings to the table.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is some of the finest jazz around folks, we highly recommend going to the Vanessa Rubin Travers Park concert at 6PM for a taste of some outdoors music before coming to The Q to finish the festival off with a bang. You won&#039;t be disappointed, but if you don&#039;t <a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-07-14&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">make a reservation</a> you might, so why not go ahead and do that now?

We&#039;re planning on doing things a little differently this year.<br /><br />We&#039;ll be open from 4PM - 9PM, and we plan on making full use of our back alley to enjoy some very urban celebrations of the birth of this fine country.<br /><br />With sprinklers, a kiddie pool, a watermelon eating contest, drinks and grilling we&#039;ve really stepped up our game this year! Come on by if you&#039;re around and hang out with us while listening to our neighbors set off illegal fireworks.<br /><br />Even if you can&#039;t make it, we wish you and your families a fantastic 4th of July and we hope to see you soon!
