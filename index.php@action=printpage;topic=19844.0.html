				&quot;The initiative, titled “Pictures for Elmhurst,” launched today to sell $150 prints by 96 New York-based photographers, including Jack Pierson, Tyler Mitchell, Peter Sutherland, Farah Al Qasimi, and others, with 95 percent of the proceeds going to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. The hospital will use the funds from the sale, which runs through April 20, to buy ventilators, masks, surgical scrubs, goggles, and other equipment.&quot;<br /><br />More info via the links below:<br /><br />https://news.artnet.com/art-world/pictures-for-elmhurst-fundraiser-1831413 (https://news.artnet.com/art-world/pictures-for-elmhurst-fundraiser-1831413)<br /><br />https://www.picturesforelmhurst.com/about (https://www.picturesforelmhurst.com/about)

				&nbsp;I tried to get them to include some of the local photographers, many of whom are on a similar level of artistry or reknown as this excellent list. They replied &quot;they are looking into this&quot; but am not sure if that was real intent or not. I think giving some money to Make the Road would be helpful too.<br /><br />&nbsp; David Rothenberg, one of those local photographers, has been holding his own Covid-19 print auction for a few weeks now and it&#039;s been a hit. Either way, a local artist showing work made here or these other artists (just a couple from Queens?) is a wonderful support for those hurting from the virus. Time to get some new art?<br />

				as this is just a mix of photographers (i don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily ny photographers &lt;maybe ny based&gt;) i&#039;d recommend looking into magnum&#039;s sale if it&#039;s still going on. much more concise selection and generally better photos. i like a lot of the photographers from the elmhurst sale but hate a lot of these photos. it&#039;s obviously for a good cause but the leg work was sloppy.
