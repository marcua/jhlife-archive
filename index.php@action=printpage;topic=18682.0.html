				To be fair all should have to follow the same rules. If you were the homeowner of the house next to this out of proportion building you would fight for rights to not have to live next to this monstrosity.

				Yeah they did it in my hometown for a stupid football stadium... just because they do it mean they have every right to do so.&nbsp; Perhaps they have a limited right to do so, on a case-by-case basis, but in most cases that I&#039;ve seen it&#039;s been for the wrong reasons.
