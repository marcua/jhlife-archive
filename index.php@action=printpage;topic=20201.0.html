				So, I somehow found this place on google maps while looking around the neighborhood on my phone (you know, how things are done these days). Map says it will be between 86 and 87 on Northern. <br /><br />https://queensbeerfactory.com/#gallery<br /><br />I feel like I willed this place into existence. Anyone have the scoop? It’s google description calls it a “brewery”, but I’ve often found this to just mean “bar with beer” in google map descriptions. <br />

				It could be like how I understand ICONYC&#039;s tap room is where the actual brewing is done in a nearby commercial building but their storefront is somewhere more accessible.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s if they&#039;re bottling and distributing; if they&#039;re just serving they could produce beer in adequate volumes within that space.

				OMG this is so exciting. It looks like they took over Vida Cuban which tells me it will at the very least have bar. Definitely will keep my eye out for updates!&nbsp;

				Found this on a google quest. It is not very informative, but I thought I’d share. Happy to get a beer there one day! We can have a JacksonheightsLife in real life meet-up.

				My SO and I will be fully vaccinated in a few weeks, were just talking about how once we were indoor dining would no longer be scary to us - though we will consider to cast a side eye at every business that built Covid sheds - so the timing on this looks promising. I&#039;d love to have a place in the neighborhood where we can get a pint with some food that goes well with beer. (South Asian and beer is a good pairing, but most of those restaurants either don&#039;t serve alcohol or serve by the bottle, I think)

				The folks at <strong>The Queens Beer Factory</strong> have announced a soft opening date of Friday, June 18th at 8:00PM. If you&#039;re on IG, they also have a promotion running. I saw their post an hour after they shared it, so the promotion tickets may have already been given out.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Via <strong>Instagram</strong>:<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/rNBdOCu.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/Uzq5Oe2.jpg)

				This seems like a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Nice to see some more upscale drinking-forward establishments joining the local bars. <br /><br />And I’m glad we’ll have a way to get local brews without venturing all over the borough.
