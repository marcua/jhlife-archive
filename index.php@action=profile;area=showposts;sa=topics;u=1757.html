					I am moving in a few months but I would like to pass along a recommendation for an extraordinary lady who has been taking care of my dog for the past two years. Her name is Maria Sroka and she sits with my dog each evening until I get home from work, sometimes quite late. (he has separation anxiety and while we probably overcompensate, she keeps him company. She walks him, feeds him, brushes him. If my husband and I have to go into work on weekends, she is most often available and will take care him until we can get home. She is loving, responsible, educated and cultured lady, who does pet sitting to bring in a little extra income, since she is retired. she always puts our dog first, and treats him with respect and care. She calls herself a pet nanny, and she is indeed. My dog loves her and we have grown very found of her too. We hope to see her after we move, but we hope that she can find a another family that will appreciate her as much as we have. She walks dogs, cat sits, takes car of birds and fish and waters plants. She can be reached at 718-898-0440. She has references besides ours but please feel free to send me a personal message if you want to know more about her.

					A new Community Plaza has risen at 90th Street and Roosevelt Avenue under the 7-Train tracks, bringing much needed life and community to the neighborhood.<br />&nbsp;<br />“The community engagement with the 90th Street plaza was an exceptional idea from the 82nd Street Partnership,” Council Member Julissa Ferreras said. “Considering that two murders recently occurred in this area, the reclaiming of this space could not come at a better time. What our community desperately needs right now is to feel that we can work through whatever issues arise and be more united for it. The formation of the Jackson Heights—Corona Business Improvement District would greatly assist our community in taking a major step in the right direction. I thank the 82nd Street Partnership for their work on this effort, and it is my hope that our other community partners will get involved and work with us as we continue revitalizing Roosevelt Avenue.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The new plaza, sponsored by the new Jackson Heights-Corona Business Improvement District, will include tables and chairs, new planters and a cultural program of music and other community activities.<br />&nbsp;<br />“This is a great step forward for building a safer and cleaner community,” said Monica Calderon, owner of L&amp;C Accounting located on Roosevelt Avenue. “For long the problems on Roosevelt Avenue have been ignored, it’s time for everyone to get involved.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The music and cultural program will be coordinated through the proposed Jackson Heights-Corona Business Improvement District and the 82nd Street Partnership and include musicians and bands who have played at past Partnership events such as Viva La Comida.<br />&nbsp;<br />“This is exactly what the community needs,” said Ruben Dario Ramirez, owner of Libreria El Dorado. “We know our business suffers when violence occurs. It’s wonderful to see the community coming together to make improvements to make the area safer.”<br /><br /><a href="http://jhcoronabid.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://jhcoronabid.org/</a>

					Pile-Up in Jackson Heights Precinct That Barely Enforces Speeding <br />by Brad Aaron <br /><br />Thursday, June 6, 2013<br /><br />Clarence came across the scene of a three-vehicle crash in Jackson Heights earlier this afternoon, at 35th Avenue and 81st Street, a.k.a. the “Scrabble” corner.<br /><br />According to FDNY, seven people suffered minor injuries, and one was taken to the hospital. Fortunately it appears no one outside a vehicle was hurt, though this crash could easily have been much worse.<br /><br />Clarence points out that there are three schools in close proximity to this intersection. “It is the same place a hit-and-run happened a little over a month ago. And I saw another fender bender there just two weeks ago.”<br /><br />In April, Clarence posted a Streetfilm of Jackson Heights drivers who fail to use turn signals — he counted 24 out of 100. The 115th Precinct, where this crash occurred, wrote 133 citations for failure to signal in 2012, and a total of 177 speeding tickets, about one every other day.<br /><br />Two pedestrians — a senior and an 11-year-old boy — have been killed by motorists in the 115th Precinct in the past six months. To voice your concerns about neighborhood traffic safety directly to Deputy Inspector Michael A. Cody, the commanding officer, go to the next precinct community council meeting. The 115th Precinct council meetings happen at 7 p.m. on the third Tuesday of the month at the precinct, 92-15 Northern Boulevard. Call 718-533-2010 for information.<br /><br />

					iT MAKES ME CRAZY TO SEE THE WAY PEOPLE DRIVE AROUND JH!<br /><br />Fatal accident on Roosevelt Avenue <br /><br />by Josey Bartlett, Editor | Posted: Thursday, May 16, 2013 10:30 am <br /><br />Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights for decades has been a dangerous mix of pedestrians, cars, bicycles and scooters. And not just a small amount of each, but mobs of each that don’t always obey traffic laws. Pedestrians rarely wait for walk signals and cars often run red lights — just to make a little headway down the congested avenue.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sunday’s fatal accident was a reminder of the road’s perils.<br />&nbsp;<br />Alba Granizo, 75, was struck and killed by a car turning left where a street sign explicitly prohibits such a maneuver, according to Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-Corona).<br /><br />Granizo was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.Police said a 1998 Dodge was making a left turn onto Roosevelt Avenue from 90th Street when the vehicle struck Granizo. The driver remained at the scene. The investigation is ongoing.<br /><br />“The accident that occurredon Sunday is a tragic example of why it is so important to obey all traffic laws and posted signs,” Ferreras said. “My sincerest condolences go out to the family of the victim for their loss.”<br /><br />As part of a 2009 survey at Roosevelt Avenue and 73rd Street the nonprofit Transportation Alternative recorded 1,830 driving violations during 38 hours. The nonfatal errors ranged from driving in a bike lane to disregarding traffic lights. No NYPD summonses were handed out during the time period, the report said.<br /><br />The Department of Transportation, which also ran a traffic study in 2009 between 41st and 37th avenues and between 73rd and 82nd streets, found traffic signal timing, conflicts between turning cars and pedestrians, double-parking and circuitous bus routing contributed to congestion.<br /><br />In 2012 the DOT widened crosswalks as well as made some roadways such as 37th Road one-way streets. A May 22, 2012 report said those improvements increased pedestrian safety, created faster bus service and sped up car travel time in the area.<br />

					The 82nd Street Partnership recently received a $50,000 grant to renovate store signs within its borders, giving the leadership another tool in its ongoing revitalization of the once-neglected business improvement district.<br /><br />â€œIt would be good for a business owner and it would be good for the block,â€ said City Small Business Services Commissioner Robert Walsh.<br /><br />The organizationâ€™s goal is to improve the commercial strip that runs along 82nd Street from 37th to Baxter avenues in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. After its previous executive director, Sharada Devi, was fired for incompetence, the commission has been working closely with the organization to turn it around.<br /><br />The grant is specifically for the block between 37th and Roosevelt avenues, which is part of the Jackson Heights Historic District. The city Landmarks Preservation Commission lists several rules for what signage is allowed in the district, such as like backlit pin-mounted letters or signs painted on awnings, but Walsh said a fair amount of businesses on the strip try to circumvent landmark rules by hanging up temporary plastic signs with rope.<br /><br />A storefront on the northeast corner of 82nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, which fronts a stairway to the No. 7 train, has several of these.<br /><br />â€œThis is peopleâ€™s first impression when they come down from the subway station,â€ said Seth Taylor, executive director of the 82nd Street Partnership.<br /><br />The 82nd Street Partnership recently became one of seven BIDs and the only Queens BID to win a contest within the Small Business Services Commission called the BID Challenge. To get a grant, the various city BIDs needed to identify unique projects that they had wanted to do to improve their commercial strips but did not have the funds.<br /><br />Taylor said he expects the one-year, $50,000 contract will be able to help three to six businesses change their signs. He said for a matching grant of an amount yet to be determined the partnership will pay for the design and offer technical assistance for the new signs.<br /><br />The contract will be finalized by the start of the next year. Taylor said they will be tapping architecture firms with expertise in historic districts to help the business owners.<br /><br />Walsh said many of the larger chain businesses on the block, like Bank of America and The Childrenâ€™s Place, have attractive signs compliant with the historical district and having more of such signs would make the commercial strip beautiful.<br /><br />â€œOther areas in the city would love such character,â€ he said.<br /><br />Reach reporter Rebecca Henely by e-mail at <a href="mailto:rhenely@cnglocal.com" class="bbc_email">rhenely@cnglocal.com</a> or by phone at 718-260-4564.

					Free graffiti removal in Jackson Heights <br />by Josey Bartlett, Editor | Posted: Thursday, December 20, 2012 10:30 am <br /><br />Graffiti be gone.<br /><br />Residents of Jackson Heights can now call a graffiti hotline (718) 803-6373 to report vandalism of their property. Councilman Danny Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) announced last Thursday he secured $23,000 to sponsor the anti-graffiti program in his district.<br /><br />Graffiti will be removed approximately two weeks after being reported, Dromm said.<br /><br />Other council members in Western Queens also offer free removal services. Residents of Sunnyside and Long Island can call Councilman Jimmy Van Bramerâ€™s (D-Sunnyside) graffiti hotline at (718) 383-9566.<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-Corona) does not have a graffiti hotline, though a spokesman said her office hosts neighborhood cleanups, which include graffiti removal, from time to time.<br /><br />In Astoria Councilman Peter Vallone Jr. (D-Astoria) routes the 100 graffiti complaints a year he gets to the 114th Civilian Observation Patrol or the New York Anti-Crime Agency. The removal service is free.<br />

					Jackson Heights block to get facelift <br />by Josey Bartlett, Editor | Posted: Thursday, December 20, 2012 10:30 am <br /><br />In a yearâ€™s time some of the buildings on 82nd Street between Roosevelt and 37th avenues will be restored to their historical prime, 82nd Street Partnership Executive Director Seth Taylor said this week.<br /><br />â€œThe block has some best examples of Neo-Tudor style in the city,â€ Taylor said, referring to the streetâ€™s peaked roofs and grided stone, wood and stucco facades.<br /><br />According to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the tenants and business owners on 82nd Street are one of the least compliant in the city with historical district rules. The block has about 52 outstanding violations, LPC spokeswoman Lisi de Bourbon said.<br /><br />â€œFines of up to $5,000 may be assessed if owners do not address the illegal conditions or ignore the violation,â€ de Bourbon said. â€œHowever, this is not the case in Jackson Heights because we are working in partnership with the BID and the owners to ensure the work is legalized.â€<br /><br />To incentivize those businesses the 82nd Street Partnership was awarded a $50,000 Storefront Improvement Program grant by the cityâ€™s Department of Small Business Services. The money will allow the partnership to work with between five and seven store owners on the block, Taylor said.<br /><br />Phase one will be to create a design that eliminates their LPC violations, and will be paid for in full by the grant.<br /><br />Phase two implements the plan, in keeping with the neighborhoodâ€™s architectural style. Owners will split the cost of construction with the 82nd Street Partnership. Taylor estimates each project will cost about $5,000 in total and take about two months from start to finish.<br /><br />The partnership will stretch the grant by targeting businesses with LPC violations as well as those with smaller problems such as changing signs and awnings.<br /><br />â€œWe are going after low-hanging fruit right now,â€ Taylor said. â€œThose we believe will have the biggest impact on the appearance of the neighborhood.â€<br /><br />Besides appearance the 82nd Street Partnership is concerned about the economic impact the violations have. LPC summonses slow down the process of filling vacant spaces and capital improvement projects, because the city will not issue permits to individuals with violations. More often than not new tenants want to remodel the inside of their shops when moving in.<br /><br />â€œThe new renter would have a difficult time obtaining a permit and this would delay construction of the new shop,â€ said Judson Ain of Flushing Kent Realty Management LCC, which has managed the building on the corner of 37th Avenue and 82nd Street for close to 50 years.<br /><br />Ain added that the landlord would not collect rent during the time it takes new renters to fix any problems they inherited.<br /><br />The owners of the building, Hampton Associates, have agreed to comply with ridding it of violations to avoid such economic costs in the future.<br /><br />Lens Lab Express owner for 10 years Brad Polan said his business does not have any violations. His neon signs are inside the store and his awning predated the stricter regulations.<br /><br />â€œThe awning was grandfathered in. I believe Landmarks would have liked me to change it,â€ Polan said, adding that a new awning would be costly. â€œIf they got a grant to improve the building, I think thatâ€™s great,â€ he said.<br /><br />Tenants are required to get consent before moving forward on construction, especially in historic districts, Ain said.<br /><br />Additionally, some owners fail to fill out the correct permits that make sure they follow historical district bylaws because the paperwork is â€œconfusing and cumbersome,â€ Taylor said. â€œWith the grant we will walk them through the process,â€ he added.<br /><br />The Partnership has been promised the grant, but still needs to finalize the contract with the city. Taylor hopes the paperwork will be signed by the end of year.<br />
