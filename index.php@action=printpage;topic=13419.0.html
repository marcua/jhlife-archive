				This new place, according to the article, will not be a chicken place or regular restaurant. It will be a tapas (appetizers from Spain) and there will be no alcohol. Lots of large TVs. <br /><br />Sounds like a fun place<br />

				I think you&#039;re misreading the article. The new place, Pollos Mario, is a bar. The guy quoted in the article is saying they don&#039;t serve booze at the restaurant (Pollos a la Brasa Mario).

				Well, there are at least a dozen &quot;sports bars&quot; within 10 blocks of that location, all offering sports on big-screen TVs, cocktails and provocatively clad women hired by the establishments to converse and dance with the patrons.&nbsp; Not that any of that is bad.&nbsp; It serves a purpose.&nbsp; And it is indeed probably a great time if that&#039;s what you&#039;re into.&nbsp; It&#039;s just that there are already SO many bars (all proudly advertised as &quot;sports bars&quot;) that have this covered.&nbsp; Maybe the new joint will offer a twist on the old formula, maybe there IS such incredible demand for yet one more of this type of bar, all fine and dandy.&nbsp; It just would be nice at some point--and I know I&#039;ve brought this up before--to have one, just one bar in the neighborhood (aside from Terraza 7) where a single woman or couple can go, a bar not geared towards dudes dudes dudes and more dudes.&nbsp; Or am I wrong in thinking that this kind of place might do well in the neighborhood.&nbsp; And, really, this is not a complaint on the neighborhood or a dream for gentrification--just the hope for a little variety in the local bar options.&nbsp; Maybe Dudley&#039;s place or Stew&#039;s place will take care of that.

				I think this place is about to open.&nbsp; It is filled with flat screen tv&#039;s -- at least 6, maybe 8.&nbsp; In fact, from across the street it looks more like the tv department of Best Buy than a restaurant.&nbsp; :(

				I&#039;d think a bar that feels welcoming to single women and couples would work in this neighborhood. One thing I haven&#039;t found yet in JH is my local watering hole. The place I go to have a drink or two on the weekend, whiling away an hour with a book, getting to know the bar staff and become friendly with some of the regulars, without loud music (looking at you Margarita&#039;s) pounding in my ear, where the volume is kept off so I can ignore the game if I want to, where I meet my spouse for a drink after work, and where if I wanted to get a bite to eat that didn&#039;t involve a piece of meat the size of my head, I could do so without consuming my total calories for the next three days. I dug those kinds of places when I was single, and I dig them now that I&#039;m coupled. <br />

				Has anyone else noticed the sports bar changed its name to Barilles (?). I think it&#039;s a good change. Has it changed ownership? Or did Mario conclude Mario&#039;s Chicken Sports Bar wasn&#039;t the right branding?

				Has anyone been?&nbsp; Based upon the Jamison casks displayed in the window, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s a Colombian interpretation of an Irish pub.&nbsp; &nbsp;I assume it&#039;s an attempt at rebranding this newish restaurant, which seemed to always be empty when I walked by. Possibly due to a saturation of similar restaurants in the neighborhood? <br /><br />The question is, do they have bangers and mash or pollos a la brasa?&nbsp; Maybe Irish/Columbian fusion?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do they know how to pour a Guinness, or just crack open an Aguila.&nbsp; Curious, but not hopeful.&nbsp;
