				yes, gangs of aggressive squirrels are one of our worst problems. in fact, i think they&#039;re a big part of this uptick in slashings in the city.<br /><br />some people *like* animals. all animals. that&#039;s why they feed them.<br /><br />if you own a home, put up a sign warning people not to feed animals there, as is your right. go out and directly confront people who violate your property rights if you wish. it&#039;s not illegal, so calling the cops isn&#039;t an option -- but if you feel strongly enough, you can agitate with elected officials to get a law passed. all good options.

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t see how that can cause&nbsp; harm to anyone.&nbsp; I carry nuts in my purse and feed squirrels. I&#039;ve also been known to carry cans of cat food and feed strays. Sorry you are so miserable and hate animals so much. BTW I&#039;ve seen rats in this neighborhood eating out of garbage bags on garbage day and have never seen rats with nuts in their mouths or bird seed.

				I see civility has gone out the window.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dude - people feed animals.&nbsp; It happens in every country, in every city, in every town and in every area.&nbsp; I&#039;ve travelled extensively, and it&#039;s not a Jackson Heights thing, it&#039;s an everywhere thing.&nbsp; You don&#039;t like it.&nbsp; That&#039;s fine.&nbsp; We all live in a great Nation when we can have differences of opinion.&nbsp; Belittling someone else&#039;s opinion is just wrong.&nbsp; We&#039;re not all Donald Trumps here.&nbsp; You can make your point about how it impacts your kid (something you did not originally say) without lashing out on people.<br /><br />As for mocking someone based on how much they make (and how hard their life is as compared to you), I&#039;ve always been taught to treat everyone I meet as my equal, and everyone older than me with greater respect.&nbsp; No one is saying that you should also, but a little respect goes a long way.&nbsp; And count yourself lucky for the opportunities that you had that put you where you are now.&nbsp; Not everyone gets the same opportunities in life, no matter how hard they work.

				Anybody who loves pigeons and cares about their welfare should not feed them.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is cruel and unnatural.&nbsp; Pigeons naturally should be spending a good share of their time searching for food.&nbsp; &nbsp;When they are overfed, they tend to overbreed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The result are exploding populations of pigeons, which must contend with boom-and-bust cycles of food availability.<br /><br />By the way, here&#039;s an interesting podcast about why pigeons are &quot;surprisingly awesome&quot;:<br />https://soundcloud.com/surprisinglyawesome/9-pigeons<br />It discusses the millenia-long relationship between humans and pigeons, and how pigeons descended from one of the most prized animals to one of the most reviled.

				So what I&#039;ve learned here is that a number of posters on this board think that unless a quality of life issue rises to the level of slashings and murder, keep your trap shut. <br /><br />Get perspective folks. Food laying around *does* attract vermin other than pigeons and squirrels. Why do you suppose there&#039;s rat traps surrounding most every residential building in NYC? And if you&#039;re a real animal lover, may I suggest laying off feeding squirrels and pigeons and contributing to untenable increases in their population, and do something that&#039;s actually useful. Participate in a TNR program for stray cats. Donate time and money to a shelter. Anything else has to be better than freaking out over someone&#039;s complaint about folks who foolishly feed pigeons and squirrels.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, the last place I rented I was a tenant for over a decade. My rent was decidedly less than market rate for a new apartment after only a couple years. Renters often pay less per month than folks with a brand spanking new mortgage, just as people who own after a few years will likely pay less than folks who have just moved to a new rental in the same neighborhood.

Been doing it awhile and have never seen any vermin hanging about--just some jealous mourning doves. When I carry nuts with me, I toss them to squirrels who eat them right away. This adds up to possibly four or five empty nut shells a week. I realize the squirrels are spoiled, but I think they were spoiled long before I came along, since they live in a big courtyard with a lot of trees and appear to be accustomed to being fed. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the first person feeding them and won&#039;t be the last.

				JD has made his or her opinion clear on many things: squirrels, pigeons and homeless people are all vermin. we need to cleanse jackson heights of all things that do not please JD. i had my fill of this person when he or she proposed various &quot;solutions&quot; for ridding the neighborhood of people that he or she finds unpleasant -- but as far as i can tell, i have no solution that will allow me to block that inane droning. oh, for facebook-styled technology. ::)
