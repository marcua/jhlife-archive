				I feel that far too often, the comments and topics on this site trend negative. I want to say something nice. Today I walked out of my apartment to the green market. It was bustling. The taco/ empanada-cart ladies were in full swing. There was a pumpkin patch right here on the play street. The fall harvest was represented in all its glory. There was a group of kids doing some kind of interactive cooking class . The breeze and the sunshine was just right- streaming through the canopies of our beautiful mature street trees and landscapes. I walked to 37th Avenue and found the Jackson Heights Art Club showcasing their works on the iron fencing of P.S. 69- an extra bonus for walking the neighborhood. Yes- the Jackson Heights Art Club is STILL ALIVE despite their website being down.<br /><br />Days like this we get to appreciate the beauty of our neighborhood. The architecture, the design, the history and the community that lives here today. The diversity here makes it an interesting, vibrant place to be. Jackson Heights may not be what it once was, but there are moments of pure beauty here.

				Although I didn&#039;t make it to the greenmarket today, I did enjoy seeing a few pics from one of my favorite JH instagram accounts, @jacksonheightsny<br /><br />Check it out -- really great pics of everyday life in JH.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need an instagram account to see the photos -- they will appear when you click this link https://instagram.com/jacksonheightsny/ JHL has an instagram account too! https://instagram.com/jacksonhtslife/<br /><br />Thanks, queensplantboy, for starting this thread.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				1. The JH post office is pretty awesome now with the two extra self-checkout machines.<br /><br />2. I haven&#039;t stepped into the new Key Food yet, but it looks pretty nice on the inside from an outsider&#039;s glance. We desperately need another large supermarket in that area as Foodtown has gotten insanely crowded.<br /><br />3. Patel&#039;s has become the nicest looking supermarket in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />4. Got a chance to visit the new subway station on one of our very own lines: 34th St &amp; Hudson Yards. Looks great. We are so close to the High Line now!
