					&quot;A man remains on the loose after he opened fire on cops in Astoria and crashed his truck before fleeing on foot Thursday — in an incident that forced the shutdown of the Queensboro Bridge.<br /><br />The man was driving a stolen pickup truck with Florida plates when he was stopped at Broadway and Crescent Street at around 8:50 p.m., law-enforcement sources said.<br /><br />He fired one shot at the cops — but missed — before taking off and clipping at least one officer with the truck as he sped away, a source said.<br /><br />The officers opened fire on the vehicle, according to police, and the driver made it only about a half- mile before crashing the black Ford F-150 at 37th Avenue and 24th Street and running away, a source said.<br /><br />Patrons at a local bar were startled when the gunshots rang out.<br /><br />“We sit down at the outside tables and then — boom!” said Paul Guidone, 27, who was at The Strand on Broadway. “Everyone jumped and ran inside.”<br /><br />Police in Manhattan’s 19th Precinct closed down the bridge in both directions for about 30 minutes to make sure the shooter did not flee Queens, as officers canvassed the area around the shooting.<br /><br />Police recovered a .38 caliber handgun in the abandoned pickup truck, according to a source.<br /><br />The vehicle was stolen just two days ago in West Palm Beach, according to a law-enforcement source.<br /><br />Police sources said that the vehicle matched the description of a truck linked to an earlier robbery.<br /><br />At around 4:20 p.m., a person matching the description of the suspect stole a 49-year-old woman’s purse from her shoulder in East Elmhurst, cops said.<br /><br />The victim chased the man down to a pickup truck with Florida plates that also fit the description of the vehicle and attempted to reclaim her purse before the thief drove away.<br /><br />The woman was dragged for a few feet as she tried to cling to the vehicle but eventually let go, causing minor injuries.<br /><br />The man was still on the run this morning as helicopters were deployed.<br /><br />A police source said that cops were looking for an older white man, with a heavy build, who stands around 6-feet tall and weighs about 225 pounds.<br /><br />The suspect was described as being about 50 to 60 years old, and wearing glasses. He was said to have had short-cropped salt and pepper hair.<br /><br />Two officers were taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan with minor injuries. They were listed in stable condition.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queensboro_incident_bridge_loose_YVd8nFf1pGHrRlBQGu2ucK" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queensboro_incident_bridge_loose_YVd8nFf1pGHrRlBQGu2ucK</a><br /><br />and also: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216035" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216035</a><br /><br />

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />I moved to JH a few months ago from Brooklyn, and I&#039;m enjoying it so far. Never before have I lived in a place where practically all four corners of the globe are within walking distance of one another. The strong artist presence was a wonderful surprise too, as I am a lover of the arts myself. And I was beside myself when I stumbled upon the stationary store on 37th. The only things I find myself wanting are green space in the form of parks and a nice bookstore that doesn&#039;t involve a trek. But that&#039;s what the subway is there for.<br /><br />I do have a couple of questions that perhaps someone can answer here:<br /><br />1. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to meet people/make friends in this area? I know there are artist groups, but I&#039;m not really an artist myself. I&#039;ve tried bars, but I&#039;m finding that that&#039;s not really my scene. I searched for Meetup groups, and there aren&#039;t any for this area. <br /><br />2. Are there any stores in JH besides Lemon Farm that carry imported Italian cheeses like gorgonzola and taleggio? I tried the Italian shop on 37th, but they didn&#039;t have what I was looking for. <br /><br />Any feedback will be appreciated!
