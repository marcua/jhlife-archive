				For a few years now I have been involved in designing, renovating, selling and increasing the value of apartments for some investors and Sponsors.&nbsp; A couple of years ago I got a chance to work with some guys that were curious about how I did things and still pull top dollar in some buildings.&nbsp; The formula is pretty simple, we all want to live in beautiful place and value in use is 1st and foremost.&nbsp; A place that you are proud to call home and a place were a good neighbor is the norm and not the exception.&nbsp; I worked closely with the supers (honest, genuine good supers are hard to find) and the sellers as well as the buyers.&nbsp; I tell it like it is and that&#039;s the best I can do.&nbsp; I guess my formula was so simple that it was moronic.&nbsp; Well, here we are again and 2 years after we practically increase sales and values by 60% at 59-21 Calloway (the new amendments are in) we have began selling units here about 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have set the standard for the prices in the area and we are proud of it and the shareholders and sponsors are as happy as can be. 3 Weeks ago we had 6 available units and today 3 units have accepted offers and we are negotiating the last 2 bed (Jr4).&nbsp; We have had 9 interested parties 3 of them successful and another 2 waited too long.&nbsp; We will be finishing another one with french doors and I will be advertising it in a few days.&nbsp; While the unit is not in Jackson Heights it is a good investment long term as much of NYC has historically been.&nbsp; This building is probably one of the most ethnically diverse in all of Queens, heck, maybe in America. <br /><br />I still have 1 Jr4 coverted from a 1 bedroom and a Huge 3 bed/2 bath corner unit in the 6Th floor.&nbsp; In the meantime read a bit about this building that in Sam Roberts <em>What We Are Now </em>quoted Joe Salvo saying &quot;the greatest social experiment in history&quot; (page 110 - 111 http://books.google.com/books?id=ogV1g_PCJAoC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=calloway+Chateau&amp;source=web&amp;ots=tEVAcA-5BK&amp;sig=iPpdpIWxKNCbBdgPkQkA3c0divA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA111,M1 (http://books.google.com/books?id=ogV1g_PCJAoC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=calloway+Chateau&amp;source=web&amp;ots=tEVAcA-5BK&amp;sig=iPpdpIWxKNCbBdgPkQkA3c0divA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA111,M1)&nbsp; <br /><br />and Suketu Mehta of the NY Times described it as <em>The Meltingest Pot </em>&nbsp; http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1DA173DF936A35753C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=59-21%20Calloway&amp;st=cse (http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1DA173DF936A35753C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=59-21%20Calloway&amp;st=cse) <br /><br />THANKS FOR READING!<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://picasion.com/pic3/d98e8a6f6e6a3c37bc8ef89b3babca76.gif)</div>
