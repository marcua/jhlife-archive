				I just received a check for $28 from Spark Energy. There&#039;s no explanation what it&#039;s for. I don&#039;t know this company and have never done business with them, so I&#039;m not going to cash it.<br /><br />Anyone experience similar situations?

Maybe that would be impossible, but this company has been in the news for deceiving customers.<br /><br />https://www.powermarketstoday.com/public/New-York-PSC-alleges-Spark-Energy-slammed-deceived.cfm<br /><br />One other thought - is there any way you were already switched illegally without your knowledge, and this refund check is what was required of them after they were caught and made to pay out refund checks to improperly switched customers?&nbsp; (see above link)

				If you stick with your decision not to deposit the check, you could mark your calendar for a year from now to check whether the money has made it on to the unclaimed funds of NY State website. http://www.osc.state.ny.us/ouf/ It&#039;s always a good idea to check that site from time to time anyway. I once found my name there and followed the instructions to have the check mailed to me. It was for $40.

				Yes, it&#039;s supicious. They didn&#039;t even have my address correct, I live in a house, but they listed an apt #.<br /><br />Shelby, yes I think I will check unclaimed funds next year.

				How is it that folks can access this site online, but seem to be unable to perform a simple web search? If one goes to Google and types in &quot;check from Spark Energy&quot; this is on the first page of returns<br /><br />https://www.consumeraffairs.com/utilities/spark_energy.html
