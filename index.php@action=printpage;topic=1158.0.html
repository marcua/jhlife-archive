				I just had mine refinished a month ago, and recommend this guy, Vincent Devaney:<br /><br />http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/service-misc/devaney-custom-flooring-001001<br /><br />My floor looked pretty crappy, it has various &quot;plugs&quot; that the prior owner put all over the floor to cover nails.&nbsp; I feared that the floor would have to be completely removed, and a new one put in.&nbsp; But Devaney insisted that the floor was still in good condition, actually still good for another 50 years, and didn&#039;t need to be replaced, simply sanded, and re-stained.&nbsp; He said:&nbsp; &quot;they don&#039;t make wood floors like these nowadays&quot;. <br /><br />The floor was re-stained with a darker color, and has a completely different feel than the prior light color.&nbsp; It has what my wife and I call a &quot;colonial feel&quot; to it now! <br /><br />One of the comments on the Apartment Therapy site above mentioned problems with Devaney showing up.&nbsp; My wife dealt with him exclusively, and to be honest, she did have a few instances where he was late/didn&#039;t show up, etc., during the &quot;consultation period&quot;.&nbsp; But overall, we&#039;re satisfied with the work done, and the floor is a major improvement compared to what it was before.&nbsp; Total cost ~ $3500, my apartment is ~ 850 sq. ft.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Fortunately for me, I was away during the time of the work, and didn&#039;t have to deal with the odors from the stain, dust from the power sander, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s best if you have the work done BEFORE you move in, if at all possible!&nbsp; My wife left the apartment for a few days and slept at her mother&#039;s place, the odor was that bad!

				http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=391.0<br /><br /><br />this thread is all about Home Improvement and there are a few other floor guys throughout the thread.&nbsp; This way you can speak to couple of them and decide.<br /><br />Prester, I just redid my floors but went with the water based finish and there was no odor at all and it cured in a day.&nbsp; A couple of years ago I did it like you and did not want to go thru that again. ugh.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad they did a good job.

				We had our 800sf apartment done for about $1500 with a dark stain.<br /><br />www.1800woodfloors.com<br /><br />Turned out perfect. Our co-op does not allow oil-based stains, so odor was not a problem.<br />You can schedule with them usually less than a week in advance. So it&#039;s great if you want to do this last minute.<br /><br />John, sorry to hear how much you paid.

				We had a small section of our bedroom floor that had to have new boards as well, but the price was only $350. That was about the only thing our first contractor did right, unfortunately.

				For those who&#039;ve had their hardwood floors refinished, how bad was the dust? Unfortunately, we didn&#039;t have the budget for doing this work when we bought our apartment but our place definitely needs this done. I&#039;m just not eager to have to move all the furniture out of each room when this work is done. Do you think it&#039;s also necessary to repaint because we repainted all the rooms and I&#039;m really hoping there isn&#039;t that much dirt that repainting would be necessary. Are they usually careful about the baseboards or did any of you have to reinstall these as well? I heard there were companies who have huge vacs that basically suck all the dust out as they sand so there&#039;s minimal dust around the apartment. I&#039;m hoping to find someone who&#039;ll have that machine even if it costs a little more. We have a 1100 sq and 90% of it needs to be done. The other 10% we need to replace the floor from parquet hardwood tiles to just planks.

				I don&#039;t remember the dust being that bad.&nbsp; I did use paper tape and taped around every closet door so no dust could get in them.&nbsp; And I did move ALL the furniture to my second bedroom and the basement.&nbsp; It&#039;s a bit of a pain but then it&#039;s done and over and the floors look good.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to repaint anything either if that helps.
