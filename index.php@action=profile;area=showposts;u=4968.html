					I stopped in after work this week for a to-go order, and really liked the food.&nbsp; What was even nicer was that while I was waiting, the owner invited me to sit down in back (rather than stand up front), and was so super nice when I asked him a bunch of questions about what was on the menu. Even after my order came out, he told me to wait a minute, and brought out a small dessert for me (i&#039;m not sure what it was, but it was delicious, like rice pudding but more watery, with hints of cinnamon and crushed pistachios on top).&nbsp; I actually told him I saw his restaurant on this forum, and he had me show him the website on his ipad <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> .&nbsp; Great experience, will definitely go back in the near future.&nbsp; As mentioned, interior is not modern, just run-of-the-mill, but its not a hole in the wall either, so it would be comfortable to dine-in.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I had been a Vegetarian Times regular, and got National Geographic as a gift subscription.&nbsp; I have to say, sitting and reading NG is just too great - i don&#039;t think I would read it on-line, not with all those beautiful pictures.&nbsp; It gives me ideas of all the places I would love to travel to, but probably won&#039;t!

But, frankly, I think that this subject needs to be treated with more urgency. This meeting should be happening asap.<br /><br />Meanwhile, file your complaints every time that the noise annoys you, they need the data to prove that people don&#039;t want it to stay this way:<br /><br />To write to Gov.

					I know that Alchemy has been mentioned in some online mags and blogs, and seriously talked about on this forum, but do the owners do any advertising other than that? why not in Metro or Boro mag, or even local neighborhood ads?&nbsp; If you dont read the posts on this website, or come by those few restaurant reviews, how would anybody really know they are there?&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t, and I only live 3 blocks away from it! I feel like its a problem of marketing, i really don&#039;t think its a cultural thing.&nbsp; I would venture to say there are tons of meat-eaters in these many many co-ops and residences that would love to know about this place.&nbsp; Why not have a friday or Saturday specials, or coupons or anything to entice people to come in?&nbsp; I think it would be likely to drum up business.&nbsp; &nbsp;and a website people!!&nbsp; (not just a facebook thing) Also, honestly, if you walk by the place, it doesn&#039;t look like anything would be remotely outstanding going on inside...those tarp signs strung onto the awning actually look kind creepy to me (just my opinion, no need for any comments on superficiality of signage).&nbsp; but seriously, if a place looks inviting, people will feel invited.&nbsp; and thats my two cents <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />&nbsp;

					<br />I would think (hope) they have someone at least keeping watch on the areas where these lights are, or else what&#039;s the point? - my husbands friend is in the 115 and says there are a good number of undercovers in the &#039;hood, maybe they&#039;re around..<br />Also, re:Buzz&#039;s comment --&nbsp; I cant STAND the honkers outside my window!!&nbsp; We live on a corner, so even before the light turns, those friggin cabbies are laying on their horn.&nbsp; I never would have thought the cops would devote time to actually dissuading that super annoying behavior [thanks for waking up my baby, jerks!].&nbsp; I would love to lobby to bring back that patrol!&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7557.msg44774.html#msg44774">Quote from: dssjh on July 08, 2012, 05:21:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">oh, i remember that, Buzz!<br /><br />if they only ticketed 100 of the 5000 or so daily violators, that would generate millions for the city every year. but, like laws against theft in the financial industry, those statutes are only make believe.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					Thanks for the suggestions/comments...I actually did call Aranda, and Jerry came to fix the pipe.&nbsp; He was very nice, and even came back that same night (5pm) to fix the problem after quickly checking what part he needed (because I had to work in the morning and couldn&#039;t have him come back then).&nbsp; Charged standard plumber price.<br />BUT, as mentioned in other posts, they actually did NOT return the message I left on their answering machine (sunday night).&nbsp; I called back Monday morning, and they said someone would call me by 3pm to come that afternoon to come take a look.&nbsp; Nobody called, so I had to call again at 3:45pm and Jerry came about 15 min later.&nbsp; Not sure if that&#039;s helpful, but wanted to share my experience!

It has transformed the street! It could qualify as our next nice green area is this keeps up! Beautiful gardens planted with flowers, shrubs and herbs. Trees and grass- yes, grass!- in the middle of the street and the new composting area which is coming in soon near 35th Avenue. Heroic efforts by many community volunteers led by JHBG&#039;s Nuala O&#039;Doherty! Thanks to all them, big and small, who made it happen. Our entrance to Jackson Heights can now be enjoyed rather than avoided by residents and visitors alike. Real Earth Day spirit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I believe she listed all the work they did in a posting on the JH families website.&nbsp; Remarkable effort!
