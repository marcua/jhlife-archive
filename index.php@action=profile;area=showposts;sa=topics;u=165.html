					This is a pretty good article on the MSN Moneycentral web site about real estate.&nbsp; The author actually lived in our humble nabe, growing up here, and continued living in JH into adulthood.&nbsp; He provides some history of the neighborhood, name checks Daniel Karatzas, and provides a cautionary tale to co-op and home owners:&nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Banking/HomebuyingGuide/why-home-prices-may-never-recover.aspx?page=all" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Banking/HomebuyingGuide/why-home-prices-may-never-recover.aspx?page=all</a><br /><br />Best article I&#039;ve read in a while about JH, in my opinion, despite the depressing prognosis.&nbsp; I hope he&#039;s wrong, but he lays out a good argument.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />(Note to &quot;Mods&quot;:&nbsp; I would have posted this to the &quot;Real Estate and Home Improvement&quot; section, but figured it would just get buried there.&nbsp; If you want to generate a meaningful discussion on these lethargic (as of late) boards, it belongs up front on the &quot;Neighborhood Chat&quot; section.&nbsp; My 2 cents, FWIW.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For yet even more depressing real estate info, I saw this bit about the average home price in Detroit: $13,638!!!&nbsp; I could have bought half a street in Detroit!:<br /><br /><a href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-home-price-in-detroit-falls-to.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2009/03/average-home-price-in-detroit-falls-to.html</a><br /><br />When&#039;s that new wine store opening in our neighborhood?&nbsp; I need a drink!

If this was in some <strong>Jackson Heights </strong> store window it would be passed by like it doesnâ€™t exist. This fashion world of taste and what right and wrong is a foolish state of slavery. $3290 indeed.</em><br /><br />I&#039;m not quite sure.....as a Jackson Heights resident, have I just received a &quot;backhanded insult&quot;<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; <br /><br />Amusing comment though!<br /><br />

					While walking home last night, I saw an amusing sight on Roosevelt Avenue and 76th Street, near the McDonald&#039;s.&nbsp; (About 2 shops down from the store with the mannequins with those skin tight jeans!)&nbsp; There&#039;s a small shop that sells t-shirts and South American soccer jerseys and such, and they have a TV out front, showing DVDs of bull fighting!&nbsp; There was only one guy watching it, but he seemed enthralled by it.&nbsp; My wife says she&#039;s been by that place a few times when there&#039;s a couple guys watching the bull fighting on the TV.<br /><br />The first thing I thought was, &quot;Only in Jackson Heights!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />And then I thought this would be a perfect topic for a thread here, for folks to include their humorous/silly/absurd stories about scenes they&#039;ve seen in the neighborhood!<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are plenty of stories out there even more unusual!&nbsp;

					Why are our (s)elected &quot;Mandarins&quot; in the city council so opposed to allowing Wal Mart and other &quot;big box&quot; retailers into the city?&nbsp; <br /><br />The usual argument is that Wal Mart is anti-union, but as far as I know, Whole Foods workers aren&#039;t unionized either.&nbsp; Why is Whole Foods allowed in the city, but not Wal Mart?&nbsp; Are only wealthy white granola liberals who are willing to pay for overpriced organic foods at Whole Foods and Fresh Direct entitled to have options, while the rest of the city has to remain content with crummy bodegas selling stale produce and over priced products, and a dwindling number of grocery stores?&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t think there are many bodegas paying &quot;living wages&quot;, providing health care, vacation days, paying their portion of social security taxes, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m no big fan of Wal Mart or Home Depot as far as service is concerned - the service sucks!&nbsp; If I need help with hardware questions, I&#039;ll pay more and go to Dykes Lumber or Gracious Homes.&nbsp; But if I know what I need, I&#039;ll go to Home Depot, you can&#039;t beat the prices!&nbsp; Everyone I know who lives in the suburbs near a Wal Mart says the same thing - they hate the place for service and surly cashiers, but nowhere else has lower prices!&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard positive sentiments from people living in Flatbush, Brooklyn near the new Target Store at the Junction - they like the store, and the prices are cheap.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />I think the clowns in the NY City Council need to weigh the positives and the negatives.&nbsp; If Wal Mart is such a horrible employer, why did the store that opened near Chicago receive over 20,000 applications for 325 positions?&nbsp; Why did Black Enterprise magazine name Wal Mart one of the top companies for diversity?&nbsp; OK, I&#039;m sure you cynics out there will say that Wal Mart paid them off.&nbsp; And I suppose you also believe that our city council members also are free of any unsavory relationships with the unions, right? <br /><br />I think people in the city are entitled to low prices, saving money, and a wide selection of products just like everyone in the suburbs.&nbsp; It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if Christine Quinn, John Liu, even Charles Barron! have their flunky staff members drive their SUVs to Long Island or New Jersey once a week to stock up at Wal Mart and Costco!&nbsp; <br /><br />Full disclosure:&nbsp; I don&#039;t own Wal Mart stock, they don&#039;t pay me, and I never served on their board of directors - you might want to ask Hilary Clinton, she was on their board!<br /><br />I welcome your comments/rebuttals/healthy debates!<br />

					Does anyone know if there are commercial bus tour operators that actually pass through Jackson Heights and show tourists &quot;the sights&quot; in the Heights?<br /><br />The reason I say this, is because a little over a year ago, I met someone from Toronto, Canada, and did the usual back and forth introductory conversation dialogue.&nbsp; I mentioned where I live, and he then said that he supposedly did a bus tour in New York once, and he passed through Jackson Heights and knew of the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought this rather odd.&nbsp; Usually most tour buses drive through the usual sites in Manhattan (Battery Park area, Times Square, Central Park, etc.), rarely do they pass through any of the outer boroughs, as far as I know.&nbsp; I figured this guy was either mistaken, or pulling my leg.<br /><br />But, a few months after that, I was walking on Roosevelt Avenue on a weekend morning, and saw an amusing sight.&nbsp; A tour type bus was parked around 78th and Roosevelt, and there were people who were obvious &quot;tourist types&quot; walking around Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; One guy had his expensive camera out, and was focusing his lens for a close up on one of those signs that advertise those big concerts geared towards people from central America - the ones that usually have a picture of say 8-10 guys in cowboy hats and matching denim shirts in a musical band, and then maybe 4-5 women in short skirts - I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve all seen these!&nbsp; Anyways, across the street, a bemused local pedestrian was pointing this guy out to his friends.&nbsp; He kept yelling &quot;AquÃ­! AquÃ­!&quot;, and laughing at him.&nbsp; It seemed amusing to me, the &quot;clash of viewpoints&quot; perhaps?&nbsp; The &quot;tourist guy&quot; probably thought he was taking a photograph of the &quot;gritty urban reality&quot;/&quot;local color&quot; and the local guy probably thought &quot;What the hell is he doing?&quot;<br /><br />Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone knows if there really are bus tours that pass through the neighborhood, and what they might be saying.
