				Today seems to be the first day of the closing of 34th between 80th and 73rd, to traffic. I just went power walking on this lovely day, and there were squads of traffic police at each intersection. I also saw some news cameras. The crowds were thin, given that this is just getting underway. But the kids and their parents out in the sunshine were squealing with delight. <br /><br />I know this may be a hardship for drivers, but for walkers and cyclists, it&#039;s a joy.

				With no access to my street now between the closing of 34th Ave and 78th St I was nervous about getting deliveries, but it looks like they&#039;re letting people drive North on 78th St. while 34th Ave is closed. Be aware tomorrow that 79th St. will probably be closed for the greenmarket, so you might want to avoid driving anywhere near 79th St.

				I have to say, I&#039;m enjoying the quiet streets.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard a car honking in weeks.&nbsp; And the closing of a few blocks of 34th Ave. on weekends adds a new dimension.&nbsp; This quiet prompted me to think of our neighborhood and our quality of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s time for our City Council person and Community Board to consider how we can improve our neighborhood in a visionary way.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a radical (or maybe not so radical) idea:&nbsp; Can we close 37th Avenue between say 74 St and 90th Street and also closing 82nd Street between 35 Ave and Roosevelt Ave -- allowing only deliveries and emergency vehicles?&nbsp; These are the most commercial streets and most congested streets in JH.&nbsp; To make them pedestrian only would both enhance the quality of life here (remember, we are underserved by parks) eliminating traffic noise and danger to pedestrians, and it would also enhance businesses.&nbsp; For example, restaurants could expand outdoor seating.&nbsp; Trees and greenery could be planted along the pedestrian mall etc.&nbsp; Anyway, I believe this would be a good time to start considering how to remodel and upgrade our neighborhood.&nbsp; This pandemic has given us an opportunity to reimagine our neighborhood.&nbsp;

				I am totally with you on this. I love how quiet and people-oriented the neighborhood feels, now that traffic is reduced and streets are closed. It really gives me a sense of what our neighborhood could be like. That&#039;s definitely a cause I&#039;m willing to work for.

				The closure of 34th Ave was a pilot program which has ended as not enough people were making use of it to justify the number of police needed. As most of us are staying at home, I&#039;m not sure why this was not anticipated.<br /><br />https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nyc-gives-up-on-street-closures-for-open-space-as-nypd-sick-calls-rise/2361617/ (https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nyc-gives-up-on-street-closures-for-open-space-as-nypd-sick-calls-rise/2361617/)<br /><br />I liked this as well and I think it would be great if this could be incorporated into our neighborhood either permanently or once a week.<br /><br />Madrid permanently made many streets open to pedestrians only and Mexico City closes many streets on Sundays for bicyclists and pedestrians. I&#039;ve experienced both and they are fantastic ways to enjoy both cities. I don&#039;t see any reason why this could not work here. It&#039;s not people, but cars that you need to get rid of to make this happen. <br /><br />https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/an-inside-and-outside-look-at-madrid (https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/an-inside-and-outside-look-at-madrid) <br /><br />http://cdmxtravel.com/en/top-experiences/on-sundays-zumba-and-bikes-in-reforma.html (http://cdmxtravel.com/en/top-experiences/on-sundays-zumba-and-bikes-in-reforma.html)

				As for cars going to side streets -- that would not be an issue because the residential streets do not have commercial businesses.&nbsp; Most thru traffic, I believe, will be diverted to Northern Blvd which can best handle it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to many cities in Europe and most have these pedestrian only areas.&nbsp; Barcelona, for instance has a wonderful pedestrian thruway with stores and restaurants.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite long.&nbsp; We need to think about pedestrians and our quality of life.&nbsp; Somehow, over the years, the needs of cars has been the priority.&nbsp; We have pedestrians crowded on sidewalks.&nbsp; This is not about reducing the number of people in our neighborhood but opening space for them.&nbsp; And this is not only about opening space for people but improving their experience as they shop, seek entertainment, or just walk.&nbsp;

				I love the closing of traffic on 34th Avenue from the BQE to 98th Street.&nbsp; Great idea.&nbsp; But I have a question for our political representatives:&nbsp; What are the most congested sidewalks in JH?&nbsp; Not a trick question.&nbsp; Obviously, 37th Ave and 82nd Street (between 37th Ave &amp; Roosevelt.)&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it make sense to close 37th Avenue to car traffic to allow for more social distancing?&nbsp; It would also allow the many restaurants and small shops to expand their businesses to outside areas.&nbsp; Some of the restaurants, for instance, could set up tables and service outside to expand their business, especially when they are allowed to reopen and can only have 50% or less occupancy.&nbsp; They could, conceivably, have full capacity with outdoor service.&nbsp; And we all love outsice dining.&nbsp; Small shops could also display items outside their shops on the sidewalk areas.&nbsp;

				the problem with closing a totally commercial street lies in the fact that it&#039;s commercial. the restaurants could have plenty of outdoor seating, but they wouldn&#039;t be able to get deliveries to fill their kitchens. retail establishments also need vehicular traffic -- to have merchandise delivered and, in some cases, to get merchandise out the door with customers.

				&nbsp;The 34th Ave closings are welcome for a time but you have to realize how much traffic - both vehicular and cyclists- regularly use this street! No one seems to have told the cyclists that the long running bike lanes are gone! They are still using them at high speeds as they have for decades. Also the street closures ( Northern and 37th Aves) on some weekend evenings could be an easier ask. Let&#039;s spread around the closures so one area is not overwhelmed by the shutdown and that the commercial venues get the street traffic that could be gained by the extra space that allows social distancing. Win, win.<br />

				I have mixed feelings about this.&nbsp; It’s good for social distancing. I use the bike lanes and found it difficult to maneuver. Baby carriages, people playing with their kids were doing so in the lanes, which at times made it hazardous. I also saw kids running through the flower beds planted in the median.As a driver, I also noticed that Northern was really congested I and despite parking restrictions drivers were parked and doubled parked along Northern.

I think if you want more than a leisurely bike ride, it would be wise to go elsewhere. There&#039;s kids playing hop scotch and riding their little bikes in the street. Pedestrians aren&#039;t keeping out of the bike lane (I&#039;ve made this mistake and do my best to stay out of the lane so cyclists have someplace to ride unobstructed).<br /><br />Common sense would dictate that people use the median divided road just like traffic - keep to the right, stay out of the bike lane. And the folks setting up the barriers wouldn&#039;t put them in the bike lane. But, as they say, common sense is in such short supply it should be deemed a superpower.

				Why are they allowing people to congregate on 34th Ave, Without social distancing, as I have seen every day since they have closed&nbsp; the streets. But you’re not allowed to congregate in Travers Park? And what’s up with the bike lanes on 34th, are they still bike lanes? As far as I know, they still are. And the people should stay off of them. And people, when you’re crossing the streets you still have to look at the lights because traffic is still coming the other way. And if you want to run without a mask that’s fine, just stay 6 feet away for me and we won’t have a problem

				I rode my bike through Sunnyside over the weekend and I came across two streets that were &quot;closed&quot; to vehicles, 39th Ave. and a section of Skillman Ave. &quot;Closed&quot; is in quotes as there were plenty of cars weaving in and out of the barriers. There were also very few people making use of the street closures on a beautiful day. A big difference from the large number of people making use of 34th Ave. during the vehicle closure here in Jackson Heights.

While it&#039;s not so crowded to cause me great anxiety inducing concern, cross Northern Blvd., and the neighborhood isn&#039;t nearly as dense. You don&#039;t encounter a lot of people on the sidewalks, it&#039;s easier to let down your mask to air out, you can find some grass to rest on over at Landing Lights park, and it has the benefit of hills. <br /><br />I see why people with kids and limited mobility might stick to 34th Ave., but I&#039;m a little puzzled why adults out for a solo jog during peak usage would pick it.

				The 34th Ave Open Streets has calmed down quite a bit. Lot&#039;s of people are finding the sidewalks less busy than the street and are using them for better social distancing. My info on a few other areas with street closures is that they are not well used or all that popular. It will be interesting to see when the playgrounds open, along with the dog runs and the gyms, who will be the biggest users of 34th Ave? The bikers have mostly moved off the street and are possibly are on 32nd Ave?, not sure. Going around the barriers now doesn&#039;t make for a good biking experience. It would be good to know what the potential plans are going forward, even what is on the table, so that the community can weigh in the ideas before anything just appears.<br /><br />

There are definitely school buses, but those can absolutely work with the &quot;5mph only, turn off at the next block&quot; rule without a problem. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been riding my bike on 34ave and that also seems totally compatible with the car-free street. No problems there.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think people will come from far away, or are coming from far away, just to walk down a street with no other attractions or entertainment. There&#039;s no view, no seashore, no playfields. The success of 34ave speaks to how starved JH is for open space; anyone with a park will probably go to their park.

				if i could change one thing about the way the open street works, i&#039;d ban electric bikes. during a short trip to the farmers&#039; market and a short walk after, i saw at least a dozen whizzing by at high speed, weaving through pedestrians. that&#039;s not much different than allowing cars.

				This article has a lot of cool visuals showing NYC Open Streets of the past (like Park Ave) and what they could like in the future<br /><br />It made me really excited to think about 34th St would look like if it were permanently closed to traffic!<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/opinion/ban-cars-manhattan-cities.html

				&nbsp;I think it&#039;s actually 37th Ave that needs to be closed to traffic at least part of every day. The traffic flow along 34th Ave under normal times is what keeps the rest of JH from being too clogged up. I did think that article was great though. Hard to imagine that Park Avenue was once really a park!

Kids will be free to play on 34th Avenue from 72nd Street to 74th Street, 79th Street to 80th Street and from 92nd Street to 94th Street from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m., on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

Are they going to be riding around frolicing children?<br /><br />(This idea seems very nice. I am not making a remark against children, frolicing or otherwise.)<br /><br />Weren&#039;t the chidren &quot;free&quot; to play on these streets before this government program?<br /><br />

				I am going to ignore your snide description of play streets as a government program. <br /><br />My old block in Brooklyn was a play street. It was an awesome resource. Ours was run by the PAL, and they brought games, balls, tables, and COUNSELORS (it might have been part of Summer Youth, I&#039;m not sure.) They opened a hydrant, and kids LOVED it. I&#039;m glad we&#039;re getting it here, kids need it. <br /><br />The streets are obviously not going to be so densely packed that people can&#039;t bike on them.

				I&#039;m a bit confused by it as well. Kids have been playing on these blocks as part of Open Streets. I see that more resources will be available for the &quot;play&quot; part -- meaning toys and games will be provided. But I wonder what&#039;s going to happen to the shared streets. I already have observed some accidents waiting to happen, with bicyclists and people riding scooters way faster than 5 mph. Also sometimes car drivers move the barriers so that they can access their building&#039;s garage. I&#039;m not sure if any of these blocks have garage entrances on them.<br /><br />At first glance, it seems like a good idea, but I&#039;ve been out on 34th Ave often enough to see how chaotic it already gets in the afternoons, and I hope this has been well thought out.

				&nbsp;Am not sure if the people who designated these streets actually live here or participated in the Open Streets. The area of 92-94sts seems fine but the other two choices are not so great,as I see it. The 79/80 block would be better served by opening a portion of the 79th St side yard of IS145 which is a much more appealing space during hot days or not- much more shade! And on 72/74, there are busy bus routes going both directions around IS230 and there have been numerous very close calls with people crossing right in front of the buses and forgetting about cross traffic. There is construction on both sides of 34th between 72/73 sts right now which is noisy and has supplies being delivered often. I would keep children far away from that area.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Again, strongly think the use of IS230&#039;s cafeteria in a monitored way would greatly augment the play area across the street which is a pretty decent track and play space with benches. I know we need to be outside as much as we can but anyone who has been a camper knows that you need to alternate especially during this extreme heat with indoors and out. Oddly enough, the blocks between 69th/70th have the most children for many hours of the day and the most wide open area, but they got nothing! Strange planning here.
