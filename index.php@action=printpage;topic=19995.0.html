				Can someone direct me to a reliable resource where I can learn more about the candidates on the ballot for the June 23 Dem Primary election? I&#039;m specifically looking for info on the positions and candidates for members of the state committee, district leaders, and delegates to the Judicial convention. Thanks in advance!

				I&#039;m enjoying having the time to fill out the ballots slowly and do more research into the positions and candidates. <br /><br />Information on the candidates for Judge of the Civil Court can be found here:<br /><br />https://citylimits.org/2020/06/08/who-are-those-judges-youll-see-on-the-new-york-primary-ballot/ (https://citylimits.org/2020/06/08/who-are-those-judges-youll-see-on-the-new-york-primary-ballot/)<br /><br />Bayside Live TV has interviews with both candidates posted on YouTube:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/user/BaysideLiveTV/videos (https://www.youtube.com/user/BaysideLiveTV/videos)

				I don&#039;t know most of the candidates for Delegates to the Judicial Convention, but I do recognize one - Hiram Monserrate.

				Thank you, both. <br /><br />Monserrate doesn&#039;t appear on my list of delegates. Perhaps it varies based on where in the neighborhood you live. I too remember his name as well as the scandals. <br />&nbsp;

				I believe my ballot said to pick 7 Delegates to the Judicial Convention and there were 13-14 to select from.

ON June 23, 2020 except that ballots contained in envelopes showing a cancellation mark of the U.S. Postal Service or a foreign country&#039;s postal service, or showing a dated receipt by another agency of the U.S. government not later than the day before election, will be counted if received not later than seven days following the day of election.&quot; <br /><br />It is possible that postmarked and cancellation mark can be used interchangeably, but one seems to say the day of the election and one the day before for the mark.<br /><br />If you are holding on to your absentee ballot, I&#039;d suggest sending it in soon. There&#039;s also still time for early voting to avoid the crowds, which is especially important right now.<br /><br />Friends of mine applied for absentee ballots using the paper form and have yet to receive theirs. I applied online.<br /><br />I have a feeling we may be doing this again for the general election and this is definitely a good way to prepare to prevent things from going wrong.

				Some background. There should be a civics booklet sent out to voters (or a site) explaining what the f** some of these primary elections are for. I had to dig around and cobble together sources....<br />--<br /><br />District leaders<br /><br />https://gothamist.com/news/queens-reformers-target-district-leader-races-as-next-step-after-aoc-and-caban<br /><br />this explains what they do, but doesn&#039;t mention anything about our candidates<br /><br />The district leaders recommended new reformers (anti-queens-machine)<br /><br />https://www.newreformers.org/candidates<br /><br />but I don&#039;t see anything in the 39th district. I have no idea who Sayda Aker or Yanna Henriquez are<br /><br />I have no idea who&nbsp; Rodolfo Flores is, and francisco moya is known, but ...eh?<br /><br />I also have no idea who Carmen Enriquez or Victoria Steinberg are (dssjh is about the only endorsement I&#039;ve heard!)<br /><br />Moya and Henriquez are endorsed by the democratic party as is Steinberg<br /><br />Given the shocking lack of info, I&#039;m almost inclined to vote AGAINST the people the queens democratic party is behind, just to say : wake up.
