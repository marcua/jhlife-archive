				A new wine/liquor store is getting ready to open on the south side of 37th Avenue between 79 &amp; 80 Streets.&nbsp; In a brief conversation with the owner today he said that their focus will be on wines.<br />They have a petition that you may sign, as they are in the process of getting their liquor license.&nbsp;

				The owner was at the farmers market, gathering signatures to present to the Community Board for permission to get a liquor license. I walked by the shop, and was pleased to see how he is improving the storefront. Stripping the wood down to its original finish, and exposing beautiful brass as well. I am so happy that this vacant space will not be another junk store, and that these guys recognize our nice little historic district and hope to improve it.

				I&#039;ve also noticed no activity in a while.&nbsp; The owner did mention a while back resistance from the liquor store on 84th &amp; 37th Ave which protested to the Liquor Authority this store opening.&nbsp; Could it be that the renovation is done and that he&#039;s waiting for the liquor license?&nbsp; If this is the situation, I hope they can be open for Christmas &amp; New Years.&nbsp; I would also like to see it open for Thanksgiving but that might not be possible.&nbsp;

				This really is good news. We do need a nice wine store, the existing stores are just sooo crappy. I feel like a desperate alcoholic any time I go in the place on 84th and 37th -- the bad smell, the toilet paper rolls with price tags on them, the bewildered cashiers, and it&#039;s not even cheap. So I stopped going -- I get my wine from the city or Williamsburg, life&#039;s too short to drink bad wine... <br /><br />This is definitely good news!

				They are open and this place is going to be AMAZING!&nbsp; You can tell that they are going to sell good wines, better than the generic wine sold at all the neighborhood liquor stores.&nbsp; The shelves were not fully stocked but the variety and prices looked good and hopefully it will be even better once the shelves are full.&nbsp; If you like wine, stop buy and check the space out.

				I stopped in today as I ran other errands...very nice, not too large, with a well curated selection. Wined are ordered by taste, with lighter wines closer to the window - which I think is a great way to discover new varietals.&nbsp; They let me know that their credit card machine is running, and (even better) they will be open on Thanksgiving day.

				Hello Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I just wanted to say thank you for all of your support.&nbsp; This has been a long process.&nbsp; Your encouragement along the way was appreciated.&nbsp; It kept me positive and energized as I tried to restore the space and obtain my license.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I did not make a big announcement about opening but I wasn&#039;t even sure I was going to get the doors open on Saturday.&nbsp; So we are open but please excuse our appearance as we are still unpacking boxes and filling our shelves.&nbsp; We are still working on some details but we are fully functional.&nbsp; We have lots of great wines for you to try and we are adding inventory every day. Our hours for the time being will be 11 to 8.&nbsp; &nbsp; I will also open on thanksgiving from 11 to 2 for those last minute shoppers.&nbsp; I am still working on getting our website up but for the time being to get updated on what is happening at the store you can all go to the store&#039;s Twitter page at http://twitter.com/TableWineNY.&nbsp; Once again thank you all and I look forward to seeing you at the store.

Well, at the corner at least: Italian Farms! Totally underrated in my opinion.

				Stopped by for the wine tasting at 4:30 this afternoon, and it was the highlight of an otherwise dreary day!&nbsp; What a fun thing to do on the way home from work.&nbsp; Wine was great.&nbsp; Bob Marley music was a festive contrast to the snow and slush outside.&nbsp; Really welcoming environment.&nbsp; I am delighted to welcome these guys to the neighborhood.&nbsp;

				So I just today got a chance to check out Table Wine.&nbsp; Quaint, great selection and prices, helpful staff!&nbsp; <br /><br />On this site we all talk about businesses just like this one to improve quality of life in JH.&nbsp; Let&#039;s put our money where our mouths are and support this store and those like it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will personally increase my wine consumption to do MY part.&nbsp; It&#039;s the least I can do.&nbsp; : )<br />
