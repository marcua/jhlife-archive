				Dear friends and neighbors, <br /><br />Some of you may have heard that I am part of a small group that is trying to open a new restaurant to serve our neighborhood. We&#039;ve been searching for an appropriate space over the past year, but as many of you know the market for commercial real estate in our neighborhood is limited and <em>very </em>expensive, making our search a challenge.<br /><br />We&#039;re turning to the JH community to enlist your help!&nbsp; Try as we might, it is simply not possible to be aware of everything that goes on in our neighborhood. Timing is crucial in real estate deals and getting an early tip can be the difference between making a deal and being on the outside looking in. This is why we need your eyes and ears. If you have any leads on a potential space- a business owner looking to sell, a store that is closing, or just the latest for rent sign- please let me know. Your information could be the difference between seeing another dollar store and having the convivial neighborhood institution we all want to see flourish here.<br /><br />In a perfect world, the space would have an existing kitchen, but since the world still isn&#039;t perfect (we’re working on that!), we&#039;re actively considering all opportunities.<br />&nbsp;<br />To give you an idea of what we want to do, what we have in mind is a place that will offer great beers, excellent wines, killer cocktails and delicious food. We&#039;ve been fortunate to line up a highly regarded chef to helm our kitchen and are excited for the opportunity to bring their food to Jackson Heights. This is the kind of place that will keep you local on date night; the kind of place where you can get a quick dinner with the kids without compromising on quality (where is that chicken from exactly?); the kind of place where you can enjoy a quality beverage in an inviting atmosphere, and is above all affordable and welcoming to all. That&#039;s what we want and trust that it’s what <em>you </em>want as well.<br /><br />So please let us know if you hear of anything that we may have missed, thanks!<br /><br />Dudley

				While places like yours SHOULD be on 37 Avenue, because it is the main drag, I think Northern Boulevard might be less expensive in terms of commercial rents.

				I could be mistaken but I think Listo El Pollo on 86th and 37th shuttered its doors recently. I&#039;ve never been inside so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s an appropriate space for a bar, but maybe it&#039;s worth looking into.

				We&#039;re not discounting Northern Blvd, there are some good opportunities there. The Blockbuster store is not one of them though, we&#039;ve already explored that.<br /><br />Thanks for the suggestions so far, El Listo is the reason we posted this - we got there too late, someone contacted the owner of the building before the previous business closed. If we had heard about it sooner, it might be ours. And that space is <em>awesome</em>, the broker showed us around and it&#039;s really cool. Lots of details from when it was The Dragon Seed restaurant, very interesting.<br /><br />The space near Dunkin Donuts is a possibility, but it&#039;s small and expensive (surprise). Soraya&#039;s is already taken over by someone else, from what we&#039;ve heard, and the Maram pharmacy space is really expensive and isn&#039;t set up at all for what we&#039;d like to do so it would involve huge amounts of construction. We&#039;d still consider it under the right circumstances but it&#039;s a tough one.

				I would look in the 80&#039;s, perhaps from 85-88.&nbsp; that stretch really could use some upgrading, and a nice restaurant could be help. There are a few nice places along that stretch but they could use some help.<br /><br /><br />

				Good luck with your awesome plans.<br /><br />A thought...an upstairs location would be inexpensive is my guess...are there any in the neighborhood?<br /><br />Another idea is that Jahn&#039;s is so big...they could lease you that whole back room there..!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				My first thought was the space that Arunee Thai currently occupies since they&#039;re moving to 37 Avenue. But that&#039;s not breaking news, and possibly too small for your vision.

				Unfortunately not in JH, but a great corner spot. It&#039;s been vacant for years, and probably half the rent of JH. It&#039;s on the corner of 37 ave and 61st street. 718 429 6100. I&#039;m curious what the rent would be. I heard they are asking close to 30.000 for Miriam. Not sure if that&#039;s true, but wouldn&#039;t be surprised. Anyone notice the new deli on the same block as Yogurtberry? Nice looking store, but I don&#039;t think it will last very long. I also heard their is going to be a chicken place where the cleaners was, and a chicken place where Soraya was. And I think a Falafel place opening on the corner spot where the deli used to be.

				Check out 74th Street Little India.... a restaurant there on the west side is shut down...that would be interesting...to have a Western restaurant amongst the stores along that street...<br /><br />Also on Diversity Plaza...I think a place is shutting down...now that would make Diversity Plaza truly diverse...if a western style place opened up alongside the Desi ones.&nbsp;

				i think it&#039;s closed for good this time. the space fronting Roosevelt is actually quite nice, and has a bar already in place. that side part is kind of nasty, and not really attached to the main section, if I recall correctly. that could be a terrific space if the price is right.

				When I was there a few years ago (don&#039;t remember which owner) the 37th Rd part was a very informal dining room and takeout counter.&nbsp; I think the kitchen is in that part so you really couldn&#039;t separate it.&nbsp; It could be used as a casual bistro with the more formal dining room up front.&nbsp; It would also allow for two menus with two pricing categories.&nbsp; I never remember it lasting a full year under any of its reincarnations, maybe the price negotiations could bring this up.&nbsp; I also remember when that space had a yearly fire.

				i&#039;m a little perplexed. perhaps someone can set me straight. why does it seem there is a consensus that the 37th Ave. restaurants in the 80s are somehow lacking? For what it&#039;s worth, I would think dudley was interested in that area because it has a nice mix of pretty good establishments already; only that there is room for his vision. i&#039;ll admit i don&#039;t eat out much anymore these days, but what i can see from the outside looking in is not uninteresting--Arubamba, La Gran Uruguaya, Tomo, Las Margaritas, Party Pizza just opening, a few more i&#039;m forgetting--looks diverse enuf to me, and none of it is corporate chain crap. Parking is a concern though.

				If I can draw you out of JH, there is a hardware store that had very good space, and ideally situation on Skillman Ave right on the Woodside/Sunnyside border.

				This is a long shot, but the Rite Aid on 82nd Street between 37th and Roosevelt appears to be in the process of closing. They&#039;ve moved all their prescriptions over to their enormously enlarged (doubled in size) store on 37th Ave between 82nd and 83rd. It seems likely that they will close the entire 82nd Street store. <br /><br />This is a huge space, of course.

				I&#039;m with HFM in terms of what I&#039;d like. Not a pub -- we&#039;ve got a couple already -- but something along the lines of the ones HFM lists, a nice place to have a glass of wine on a weeknight, a nice brunch option on the weekend, a good place to spend money on a &quot;New American&quot; dinner in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Not that I&#039;ll stop going to the other places I already go to, but rather that I&#039;d like to be able to have in my neighborhood what I go to Astoria and Williamsburg for. <br /><br />Good luck with the venture!

				What about where the old health food store is? They will be closing shortly because they just opened downtown market. That would be a perfect space although u would have to do the venting and kitchen.&nbsp; The location would be excellent and add a touch a class to an otherwise dreary commercial strip. Its walkable for the people below 82nd and for the people above 82, it would be a dream come true :D

				GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT!&nbsp; It also would be a draw for the people who are moving into the new apartments across the street. Great for after work. Well I&#039;m sure the rent is going to be astronomical and then the money to do all the work is another factor as well.

				I think the location of the old yo yo gifts would be perfect.&nbsp; I believe its like 85th and 37th.&nbsp; Its prob the perfect location because its accessible to center jax heights but higher in numbers so the rent might be more affordable. I just don&#039;t remember how big the inside is but I think it&#039;s big enough for a restaurant. And the fact that nobody lives above should make it easy to vent I imagine.&nbsp; The number outside says to call 212 9662788

				Dudley,<br /><br />Re: Need some help to open a restaurant/bar in JH.<br /><br />I was walking down Northern Boulevard and noticed a sign for a restaurant/bar between 83rd and 84th Streets. Don&#039;t know whether this would be of interest to you or whether you&#039;re just interested in space on 37th Avenue.<br /><br />Do you know who will be taking over the space where El Pollo Listo restaurant is located?

				We&#039;re definitely into considering Northern, and we&#039;re looking at the space you mentioned.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going into El Listo Pollo, but it&#039;s not us&nbsp; :(<br /><br />We were a few days too late to stake our claim on it, but we&#039;re looking at other spaces, there are some interesting possibilities.

				A place on Diversity Plaza would be brilliant, lots of foot traffic and the city will be spending $3 million or so to improve it, with more possible down the road. If you get hooked into a pre-improvement lease you could do well when it becomes a gateway to JH.

				Of course you have to take what is available and what works for you but I would really like to see something on 37th Avenue. It&#039;s much more charming and neighborhood like than Northern. There are also &quot;boutique&quot; type stores on the Avenue that just makes a place like the one your looking to open more fertile. Look at Smith street in Brooklyn as an example. When there are other places of similar quality, it will bring a cohesive demographic willing to patronize your place. Northern has a less charm and a lot of traffic ( car traffic that is) that takes away from the places that exist there, even if there good. Best wishes!

				Dudley,<br />I noticed that there are two spaces available for rent on Diversity Plaza. I believe one was 700 sq. ft. and the other 1000 sq. ft. Both signs had a phone number on them, and noted that they would be ideal for a jewelry store or other shop. The signs did not mention the possibility to rent for a restaurant, however they did not say no restaurants. I would imagine there may be a possibility to get a permit for outdoor seating from the city here since both spots are right on Diversity Plaza. I think this would be a great location and I know some here disagree. <br /><br />I unfortunately did not take down the phone number, however I would think the signs will still be in the windows.

Here&#039;s what you do.<br /><br />Enter an address into the BBL finder here: http://webapps.nyc.gov:8084/CICS/fin1/find001I<br />For more details, then enter the block and lot into ACRIS: http://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/BBL<br /><br />If you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll get the financial documents transferring the property into the name of an individual or a recognizable corporation. But sometimes, you&#039;ll get documents showing that the ownership is a synthetic LLC like &quot;73-01 37TH AVENUE ASSOCIATES LLC&quot; which exists only to own the property and shield the actual owners&#039; names. You would then have to go to the Corporations Department search at http://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus_entity_search.html and try to dig up information on that corporation.<br /><br />Now as regards my sample address (the Duane Reade on 73rd), we do get lucky, as we find it is owned by &quot;WALGREEN CO,&quot; as you&#039;d expect it to be. Have fun punching in other addresses and seeing what you find.

				The large space on 37th Ave between 83rd and 84th two doors down from the original health food store has been vacant for quite some time.&nbsp; About 8 years ago, it was a large discount beauty products center.&nbsp; Then it morphed into a mini mall, and eventually the whole place closed.&nbsp; It seems like it&#039;s been closed for at least 6 months to a year.<br /><br />https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7499069,-73.8828955,3a,75y,180h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s9qB_JfH0kzvSbUOu29s-7A!2e0

				It would be rude of me to not give more info, so here we go!<br /><br />It&#039;s on 80th &amp; Northern, SE corner. Used to be that Dean Carpet store. We got the keys a couple of weeks ago, busy busy lining up all of the necessary ingredients (design, permits, contractors, investors, licenses, bribes, giant posters for the windows of semi nude women wearing soccer gear that really can&#039;t be good for playing soccer in, I mean what sort of protection could those skimpy shorts offer? etc)<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try to keep a little blog thing (instagram best choice, probably?) of the construction process.<br /><br />We are SUPER excited, it is a really big space in a great location, and we&#039;re really looking forward to opening our doors next year, hopefully not too late in the year! I&#039;m happy to answer any questions you guys may have.

				Congratulations!<br /><br />When I was a kid, this was the site of Arnold&#039;s Pharmacy. Just a bit of nostalgia.<br /><br />I have said for the last few years that if you want to open a successful business in Jackson Heights, open a non-ethnic, non-diner restaurant.&nbsp; A place you can take mom to on Mother&#039;s Day, something not too fancy, but pleasant... places that exist in other neighborhoods but, up to now, not ours.&nbsp; I predict success.

It reads that you are defining your personal culture as &quot;normal&quot; and other people&#039;s culture which you do not feel you share as &quot;ethnic.&quot; Similarly, many people in Jackson Heights take their mothers to places like Pio Pio, La Boina Roja, the former La Portena and Natives, and such on Mother&#039;s Day. We have really well-regarded and even somewhat upscale restaurants that are great for family occasions; you are looking for a specific kind of cuisine.<br /><br />Please try to be a little more sensitive about your phrasing. For instance, you could say that &quot;if you want to open a successful business in Jackson Heights, open an upscale New American restaurant,&quot; which refers to a specific kind of cuisine rather than lumping people into &quot;us&quot; and &quot;the ethnics.&quot; (shades of the 1910s there ...)

				Before I read the exciting news about your new venue, I was about to comment on a couple of points about Diversity Plaza. One was someone wished there was a subway exit/entrance there. Well there is, and it was used more when the bus pulled in there. If it had an elevator, I would use it, especially if there was a Q49 stop on that side of Roosevelt, and if there was a Dudley restaurant to sit outside. The landlords should be encouraged to allow another, different-cuisine restaurant which would justify the name of the Plaza, whose restoration will benefit them. Perhaps this should be in another thread. <br /><br />Anyway, I am pleased that the new one is close to Travers Park and the Greenmarket, and very near to the terminus of the Q32 (so one could afford to nod off en route). Also the Q33 and the Q66 - I think you should include these buses in your PR. When will it open?<br />&nbsp;<br />Could you include a few Greek and Turkish dishes please? I haven&#039;t seen taramasalata, skordalia, &quot;the Imam fainted&quot; or yogurt-kebab in Jackson Heights. But then perhaps it&#039;s more fun to go exploring different neighbourhoods with distinctive character and cuisines.

				Yes, I&#039;ll happily add to the Dudley praises.&nbsp; Very excited about his new restaurant.&nbsp; He understands that improving the quality of the neighborhood, making things nicer and more interesting doesn&#039;t have anything to do with gentrification or &quot;becoming Brooklyn.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s merely a matter of, well, of making the neighborhood just a little better.&nbsp; And there&#039;s nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; A huge cheers to Dudley and everything he has planned for 2015.

				Excellent! I can&#039;t wait till you open--I&#039;ve been dying for something like this. I really miss Armondo&#039;s with its Italian comfort food. We enjoy the Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan, Thai, Colombian, Argentinian, Japanese and other options in JH—but sorely miss having some American/European options that are a cut above diner food. An Irish bar would be great, too. We like Plaka a lot, but it&#039;s far enough away that we just don&#039;t go there very often. Your location will be really great, and I think there is pent-up demand for what you are doing.

				I just checked Armondo&#039;s website and you are correct! They say they are buying Trieste and plan to open February 2015! I will miss their former location, which was on my way home from the subway and so convenient, but still this is great. I hope that once the Bruson Building is restored some good retail will go back in there--I was sad to lose those businesses but happy that the building is now being worked on.

				the Irish pub in question is Donovan&#039;s Pub.&nbsp; And it&#039;s outstanding.&nbsp; Some of the best burgers around.&nbsp; But it&#039;s not in &quot;the neighborhood&quot; (though the mile walk is good for digesting the huge, tasty chow).&nbsp; &nbsp;No food at Ready Penny.&nbsp; And shifting fare at Legend&#039;s (haven&#039;t sampled the latest menu).&nbsp; I go to Ready Penny a lot but my biggest complaint is that sometimes the music leans towards blasting mainstream pop metal and that&#039;s not always what you want to hear.&nbsp;

				I just caught up on this - I&#039;m very excited about the new place!&nbsp; but also wanted to comment back on the where do I get a good burger in JH thread running through this - the Mexican burger at City Coffee Shop on 37th - right close to Lemon Tree is one of the best burgers in NYC - jalapenos, grilled onions, melted cheddar cheese - and wonderful fries (with green sauce if you dare!) a sloppy spicy mess of cholesterol clogging heaven.

				i agree that City Coffee on 37th has great burgers.&nbsp; Their Mexican burger is the best in the city.&nbsp; As for our new arrival--my two cents:&nbsp; Make it simple.&nbsp; Great burgers, fries, large selection of craft beers, good wine, simple menu (chili, chicken pot pies, whatever).&nbsp; Avoid the Sports Bar look, lots of wood, low noise level, make it homey/comfy.&nbsp; If you have the room a spot for local musicians might be cool.&nbsp; If you do that you&#039;ll need to watch the acoustics a bit.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; Looking forward to a good burger/beer joint, where we can hang out for hours.&nbsp;

				Here&#039;s an interesting thought/concept...<br /><br />There&#039;s a beer garden in Fort Greene that used to be called Der Schwarze Kolner that does a &#039;babies and bier.&#039; afternoon.&nbsp; What they do is set up a play mat with some blocks and other toddler toys in the middle of the bar while parents get gently sauced.&nbsp; This &#039;event&#039; inspired one of my friends to have their child&#039;s first birthday party there.&nbsp; So, in this one move, you can be the most kid-friendly restaurant in the hood.&nbsp; Also will probably open The Queensboro up to pre-brunch birthday party potential.&nbsp; Looks like you have the space for it!&nbsp; Danny Dromm said it best, Jackson Heights is undergoing a baby boom, and this might be a way to capitalize on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.....

				I know the original purpose of this thread has been fulfilled, but just happened to notice that the Subway sandwich shop on the block of 37th between 83rd and 84th (next to the original health food store) is now closed and has for rent signs in the window.&nbsp; The large space next store is still also empty.&nbsp; That one used to house a huge beauty products store and then morphed into an unsuccessful mini-mall before it finally closed.<br /><br />So if anyone needs a large amount of space, they could possibly combine the mini-mall site with the Subway sandwich store and have a really huge space!&nbsp; :)

				Any more news about this awesome brunch place? I walked passed this place but it was all locked. I&#039;m super stoked about this restaurant as I am sure other people are. Please send updates. Thanks.
