				http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39898002<br /><br />Roosevelt Avenue is one of the worst areas for being harassed.&nbsp; I&#039;d gladly take pictures of these losers and send it off to whoever is enforcing.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that women can&#039;t simply walk to the subway to get to work in the morning without being harassed multiple times.&nbsp; I am fully covered up and walk very fast, so there is no way I am giving off any kind of &quot;pay attention to me&quot; signals.<br /><br />It&#039;s also pretty amazing that any time I&#039;m walking with a man, suddenly they leave me alone.&nbsp;

				I got catcalled last week on Roosevelt Ave when I was with my boyfriend!<br /><br />In this neighborhood, the worst that&#039;s happened to me was just being catcalled (though it happens much more frequently than in other neighborhoods). It&#039;s usually just, &quot;Hola, Mami!&quot; or &quot;Oooh! Nice!&quot;

				I can&#039;t stand the catcallers... I&#039;m walking my daughter to school with my son in his stroller and all I hear is &quot;ay mamita&quot; it&#039;s disgusting... And my daughter is starting to catch up on it now and it bothers her too... The harrassment in this neighborhood has been around for years but Roosevelt avenue is just horrible I rarely walk around there... Really wish there was someway to get these idiots to shut up...

				I just make eye contact and smile as I walk by and I usually get a smile back instead of obnoxious &quot;kissy noises&quot;. &nbsp;If you humanize yourself to someone they will be less likely to treat you as a piece of meat. &nbsp;If they are drunk, then all bets are off I guess.<br /><br />Edited to add:&nbsp; if you really want them to leave you alone, do what I did and turn 40!&nbsp; I used to get harrassed multiple times a day.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s only a couple of times a week, sigh... &nbsp;

				I read somewhere that police don&#039;t take sex crimes on women as seriously as they do other crimes. I was watching a report on World News Tonight a few months ago about a college girl who was raped, called the police and got arrested herself.<br /><br />I think the catcalling is a cultural difference. (I hear this is par for the course in Italy, too.) The guys don&#039;t know we think it&#039;s rude and offensive. Maybe we should start talking back.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine what the girls who wear the hoochie clothes go through walking down Roosevelt.

				Its especially disturbing when they do this to my young daughters. I can&#039;t say what my husband did to one man after a particular incident.-it was not pretty!!! I hate to sound racist but do you think in certain cultures this is acceptable behavior?

				it takes everything i have within me sometimes to not retaliate and punch them in the balls. the best thing is to just ignore. people who catcall do it so they get a reaction out of the person. it makes them feel powerful.

				I usally scream &quot;PIG&quot; or &quot;PERVERT&quot; extremely&nbsp; loud to embarrass them or if they are bothering my daughters (without my husband) I&#039;ll scream Shes a child POLICE Thats usually enough to get them running. I think as women we have to fight back when we can safely do so. If there are alot of people around we should shame these pigs!!

				I was thinking of walking around with pepper spray and spraying anyone who does this. &nbsp;One time, a man on Roosevelt Ave got really close and made kissy noises by my face. &nbsp;It was dark and I was alone and it was pretty scary.<br /><br /><br />This link shows how to buy pepper spray legally in NY:<br />http://selfdefenses.com/forcespray/newyork.html

				it is particularly nasty on roosevelt avenue, and i really don&#039;t understand what these guys could possibly get out of their behavior....has there ever been a woman who replies to &quot;hey mama, let&#039;s #$%&quot; by saying &quot;sure, why not?&quot;<br /><br /><br />and pepper spray is always good to keep at hand, C :)

				And the question always is what would these guys feel if this was happening to their mothers or sisters? Would they do it in front of their mothers or sisters?
