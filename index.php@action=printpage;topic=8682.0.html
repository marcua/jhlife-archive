				I moved here from the same area (Boerum Hill).&nbsp; I like my apartment here 100 times better but I&#039;ll admit I miss my 15 minute commute, my butcher, and some of the Italian restaurants.&nbsp; I don&#039;t miss my crazy landlord, the homeless person that liked to poop on my steps, or the hipsters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess no neighborhood &quot;has it all&quot;, but JH has enough for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just looked at the comments on the link and there are some clueless one accusing her of trying to gentrify JH.&nbsp; A couple of residents schooled them on how high commercial rents here and how it&#039;s a middle class community that is not in much danger of becoming the next Park Slope.

				I do worry a little about the gentrification effect though. On the one hand, this is an established neighborhood that is largely owner-occupied. Gentrification tends to begin with rental prices and then spill over to selling prices, but Jackson Heights lacks and abundance of rentals (for a neighborhood so dense, anyway), and is therefore missing a somewhat critical stepping stone. The lack of certain amenities (a gym, for example) and retail diversity could further stall gentrification, maybe even squash it all together.<br /><br />On the other hand, depending on how much press the neighborhood gets between her blog, brownstoner, and any other outlets that might jump on the bandwagon, there&#039;s potential for some opportunistic owners to put up a listing with a way-too-high asking price and see if they get any nibbles. And if they do, that might just set the tone for the next few years of real estate in Jackson Heights. And in that case, yes, people will be priced out of the neighborhood, specifically renters looking to buy and owners looking to upgrade. I&#039;m in the former category, and my husband and I are hoping to buy two years from now. And right now I&#039;m a little nervous.

				Erica, sad to say, they already did it. The new high is +700K, but I can find out more precisely if you&#039;d like to be more depressed.<br /><br />As a native JHer, I never thought we were other than genteel, so finding out that we need to be gentrified, via this board, has come as a profound shock. Gosh!

				Erica, I wouldn&#039;t worry about gentrification, as what happens in Brooklyn, for the reasons previously said here: established neighborhood, not really poor, high levels of ownership. <br /><br />Today Jackson Heights is 60% foreign-born. But I think that we are about to see a wave of American-born migrants to the area. Maybe that&#039;s why some might call it &quot;gentrification&quot; -- when white-Americans move to an area where they were previously a minority.<br /><br />For this reason, we might see some changes, but it&#039;s hard to say how fast it will happen.

				As dynamic as the history of NYC itself...I&#039;ve been reading the history of Jax Hts since early last century...and it&#039;s a place that&#039;s always been in flux...from white (Restricted! And pretty expensive for its era.) to German to Jewish to Eastern European to Latino to Indian to Desi to...etc, etc... <br /><br />I think the only constant is that folks... are fearful of change...and yet, ironically, change is all that&#039;s ever occurred here. Historically.<br /><br />Thankfully, one thing that&#039;s very positive...is that JH can never go back to white restricted!...Regardless of the changes that lie ahead.<br /><br />

				Technically this blogger did not live in carroll gardens-that area Is red hook. My family has been in Jh for over 30 yrs. Shorty after marrying we lived in carroll gardens and loved it but after having children realized unless we want to spend millions we need to look elsewhere. We decided to move closer to family in 96- initially renting and eventually buying and are so happy with our decision. To me JH has everything. We are close to the airport, almost every major subway line, bus line, etc, etc. Sure there are things we would love and some improvements but overall, I have never once said I wished we would have moved to Long island!! I am almost seeing Jh becoming like park slope (for the better) I love the farmers market, I love that some of the stores are carrying organic healthy options, I love the sense of community and the cohesiveness. I also think that blogger bought our last apt and wish her luck!!
