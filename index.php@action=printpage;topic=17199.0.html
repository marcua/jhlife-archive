				Hmmm.&nbsp; I wonder if the fact that the L is capitalized means anything.&nbsp; Acai bowls do nothing for me but the sign also says breakfast lunch and dinner so maybe it will be more than just a fancy juice/smoothie place. They&#039;d need to sell a ton of smoothies to pay that rent.

				This is so cool! Really happy to have more healthy options coming to the neighborhood. I love all the restaurants in JH, but not being able to run out in pajamas to get an acai bowl does sometimes make me wish I lived in a neighborhood with more choices.

				Yes, they&#039;re open!&nbsp; It&#039;s a &quot;soft open&quot; so they can get ready for an official grand opening sometime soon.<br /><br />I got a delicious almond butter and banana sandwich this morning for $4.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a real treat.<br /><br />They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, acai bowls, smoothies, soups, and salads, with many healthy and vegan options, and plenty of seating.&nbsp; The atmosphere looked relaxed, warm and welcoming.&nbsp; &nbsp;It reminded me of type of place one might find in a college town upstate.&nbsp; It looks like a great addition to the neighborhood.<br /><br />A person I spoke with said the owners have a smoothie place in Astoria, and the menu looks a lot like Ayurveda Fresh (http://www.ayurvedafresh.com/menu.html), so I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s it.

				I use a wheelchair. My coworkers were raving about the food today, so I wanted to check it out this afternoon. I got there, and a passerby saw me struggling to get up the small, steep ramp while trying to open the door at the same time. I couldn&#039;t do it, so he tried to help me. The one open door (it&#039;s a double door with one locked side) is too narrow for my standard width chair to pass through. The staff inside just stared as I struggled trying to get inside, and didn&#039;t offer to help at all. The door is a double door, so both sides could have been opened by staff, but as I said, they just stared. I never got inside. The ramp appears to be steeper than the ADA 1:12 ratio regulation for restaurants. ADA says that any restaurant that renovates must be brought 100% up to code. Very disappointed.

				Kind of a standard problem at more and more places. No matter how well intentioned a place is, young, inexperienced staff always seems to drop the ball. I was asking someone who works there questions relating to allergy issues re:ingredients in some of the menu items and couldnt get a solid answer to a single question.<br />Customer service is the most important thing to drive traffic to your store, but it always is the first place companies cut corners.

Best the neighborhood has IMHO. <br /><br />The Astoria mini chains, Lockwood, Sacs and now this appear to have a winning formula - work out the kinks in Astoria, then take their experience to JH spaces that need minimal adjustment/building work.

				I got a really delicious salad there today and they were very accommodating and careful about my nut allergy. I hope they stick around a while as I&#039;m looking forward to trying quite a few things on their menu. <br />That said, I&#039;m very disappointed to hear about @thedisabledfoodie&#039;s experience. The next time I go in, I&#039;ll ask for a manager (or their contact information) and ask about getting the ramp and door issues addressed soon so it&#039;s accessible to everyone in the neighborhood. Maybe if a few of us bring it up they will act quickly to remedy this.

				I&#039;ve been in here twice now for soup.&nbsp; Black bean soup&nbsp; had more veggies than anything else, but&nbsp; okay nonetheless.&nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t had the chance to try anything else so I can&#039;t really comment on the quality of the food and or coffee.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; agree more about the outside appearance.&nbsp; It looks dirty and is a turnoff for me. Beside the windows being dirty there is white paint smeared at the bottom of the entrance window with their name. The blank putrid green walls on the interior don&#039;t seem to help much either.&nbsp; If an owner cant take care of the exterior, then it does make you wonder about the back of the&nbsp; house.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				The soup is good, and the grilled chicken salad and salmon sandwich I had was also good. I agree that the appearance of the store is a negative in terms of attracting customers. It does look sketchy from the outside, and inside there is zero attempt to make the place look inviting. There are big, bulky tables and heavy chairs that are hard to manipulate, detracting from comfort, and the food is all served in takeout containers, so they don&#039;t seem to want to encourage eat-in customers. <br /><br />It seems set up to be takeout and delivery primarily. Which is too bad, because the offerings are good and different from other neighborhood places. It could become a nice little health-food cafe, a nice hangout with coffee drinks and a much broader menu than E77 has. But not as it currently stands. <br /><br />Also, I think the appeal of the acai-based offerings is more limited than they seem to think. They stress their acai bowls in what little promotion they do--but I&#039;d never order those. I&#039;m interested in the soups and salads and sandwiches. I&#039;m not sure who gets excited about acai bowls, and you&#039;d think that&#039;s basically what they offer the way they promote them. All criticism aside, I hope they succeed because the food really is good!

				Some light colored art work (to break up the green walls) and flowers on the tables (nice $10 fake bunches can be had in the flower district) would go a long way to spruce up the place and make for a much more inviting environment.&nbsp;

				I agree with dssjh that most diners are focused on the food and not the windows.&nbsp; However, there are those that won&#039;t dine in restaurant with filthy windows and why lose those customers.&nbsp; A commercial Squeegee with a long handle costs less than $50.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need to hire a costly window washer since it can easily be done by the owner or an employee in about 30+ minutes once a month when the restaurant isn&#039;t busy.&nbsp;

				They should probably remove some things from the menu:<br />Avocado Toast, ended up being what seemed like pre-made packaged guacamole on hero style bread (higher end hero style bread) in a sandwich config. It seemed like a guacamole hero.<br />Poached eggs, ended up being hard-boiled eggs in the shape of poached.<br /><br />They don&#039;t know how to do either one of those items, maybe it was just a bad morning, but they were so far from what they were supposed to be it was a shame to spend the money on them.<br /><br />It could be that all they had was some guac and that type of bread, but that isn&#039;t Avocado Toast, don&#039;t try it or attempt to pass it off or phone it in if you can&#039;t do it correctly. Also, don&#039;t say you can poach an egg if you don&#039;t know how to do that.<br /><br />I really like their soups and salads, but those two items were abysmal. Beware on those two.

				I went to Fresh Spi&#039;L&#039;t Milk the other day. They have a pretty good selection of sandwiches, smoothies and other stuff. I want to try one of their sandwiches. The interior is pretty nice. <br /><br />Unfortunately it seems kind of overpriced. I didn&#039;t have a lot of time so I shared a small mango smoothie with my son. It was $6.00. https://www.seamless.com/menu/fresh-spilt-milk-7709-37th-ave-jackson-heights/623717<br /><br />If the sandwiches are at a real gourmet level and big too then that&#039;s ok, otherwise I would probably get a sandwich at K&amp;L deli right down the street. K&amp;L sells large heroes that are pretty good for $9.00, but they aren&#039;t gourmet so this is where Spi&#039;L&#039;t could justify their price. <br /><br />That being said, I think they would have a better chance as a gourmet sandwich / juice shop if their marketing was better. The name is terrible and, as someone said above, you can&#039;t tell what it is they are selling.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think they could learn a lot from Pauglina: Focus on one main thing. Make it very obvious to your customers what that is. Sell it at a fair price.

When you consider the food cost and the other expenses (rent, utilities, employee compensation, storage costs, spoilage), you realize the business isn&#039;t exactly raking in cash hand over fist on a smoothie. Smoothies are just super easy to make (blender + yogurt + fruit) and I&#039;d rather spend my money on things when I eat out that I can&#039;t make easily at home.<br /><br />If the portion size is fair for a lunch (meaning it will fuel you until about 5 pm), I think it&#039;s really hard to argue that $10 for a salad that includes baby kale, avocado, grilled chicken, black bean salsa, baked Japanese sweet potato, spiced pumpkin seeds, and dijon-maple vinaigrette is over-priced. Now, whether or not there&#039;s a market for it in JH is a different story.<br /><br />I agree though that name though isn&#039;t helping the store get customers. To me it sounds like a milkshake stand (and a poorly named one at that).

Very glad to have it as an option in the neighborhood and hope they stay afloat.<br /><br />I agree they are doing themselves no favors with the totally confusing name, however.

				Ha--the website is definitely under construction with placeholder copy. And the pix do not even vaguely resemble the actual offerings. They have someone creating a website who is just using stock photography and made-up copy to sketch it out. Surprising that it&#039;s live at this point. But I&#039;m glad they are doing a website, and I hope they succeed, because I&#039;ve also enjoyed everything I&#039;ve ordered there. I hope their eventual website will explain the origin of the name!

				I went to Fresh Spilt Milk (sorry I refuse to do the weirdo caps and apostrophes, I really dislike the way they did the name) the other day and got the roasted eggplant sandwich. I&#039;m not a vegetarian but I believe this is a vegetarian sandwich (not vegan though). The sandwich took far too long to make -- almost 25 minutes-- and the air inside of the store was full of grill oil haze that I wasn&#039;t too happy to breathe. But the sandwich truly was tasty and light. I&#039;d definitely got back and get it again. Maybe call in and order in advance if I can.

				Are you sure it&#039;s closed and not just temporarily closed--which seems to happen a lot to places around here for whatever reason. That really was a speedy death if it&#039;s really closed--it was only open maybe 3 months. It&#039;s hard to believe the owners wouldn&#039;t have planned for a ramp up that was longer than that. Too bad if it&#039;s true--the food was good and different from other JH options. I was noticing more people in there recently--never a crowd, but more than at the beginning.

Restaurants will often close for a few days if they need to remediate issues that caused them low inspection scores.&nbsp; I don&#039;t take pleasure in it...but these inspections prevent people from getting sick and many restaurants can be very sloppy until caught. Hopefully this place is just redecorating, and the halal fast food place actually just needs to do some &quot;maintenance&quot;.<br /><br />On the broader issue about the ultimate success of these places: Over 90% of small businesses fail, and most in their first year. Anybody who opens a shop knows they are taking a chance. The reason there are so many cell phone shops and dollar stores in JH is because they are relatively safe ways to make money if you don&#039;t have any particular skills that you can convert into $$ at your business (like a chef).

				The food was good, the service was terrible. Last time I was in it took almost 40 minutes to get a salad. I appreciate that ingredients are fresh and anything cooked is also made fresh and isn&#039;t sitting around under a warming lamp. But that&#039;s the same deal at JUST MADE 4 U and I&#039;m in and out there in under 5 minutes, maybe 10 minutes if they&#039;re slammed with a bunch of delivery orders. <br /><br />I&#039;d ask them not to spend money on renovations, spend money on getting more (and more engaged) workers.

				Of course I’m wishing the best for the owners, and hope they end up where they want to be. On the other hand, it is an existing restaurant, with all the permits in place. If they were to move on, it would be a great opportunity for someone to move right in. Just really needs cosmetic work, I’m assuming the kitchen is all brand new. Their would be no liquor, so that makes it much easier to assume control. Can we guess what the rent is? $7000 maybe? Although, with new owners, generally comes with a new lease and terms. It’s a nice space, with prime location. Sit down casual for sure. Maybe something like a takeout/buffet? International for sure..... So, any other hopeful restaurant wannabe owners out there?

				I was holding out hope that this was a minor permitting issue that would be addressed, but based on this other thread (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17734.0), it looks like this may be a permanent loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I am terribly disappointed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The food was delicious and healthful, and filled a niche that was not otherwise available in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Yes, they had a bit of a bumpy start, but they were trying something different and showed promise.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully somebody will try a similar concept and be more successful at it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Oh how disappointing! Fresh Spilt Milk had very good and healthy food and offered a distinctly different option for the neighborhood. I wonder what happened, as I heard heard the owner was not new to the business and may have owned another place somewhere else in Queens. But maybe that wasn&#039;t true. Personally, we don&#039;t eat pizza, so another pizza place is of no interest. I hope someone else tries another similar concept here--the salads were unusual and their soups were excellent.

				Unlike Pauglina, FSM was constantly busy in the evenings when I went past it.<br /><br />Unlike Pauglina, &quot;take out food&quot; for $8-$15 a dish is a well established business model that works even in JH.<br /><br />Like Pauglina, this was aimed at people with taste who care about quality, and thus, upon failure, earns the schadenfreude of other people in this neighborhood who appear to relish the relentless redundancy/duplication and mediocrity of many businesses here.

				Not surprised that it closed down. A health food place has tons of potential in JH - look at Just Made 4 U - but this business&#039; execution left much to be desired. I hyped up this place and showed the menu to a number of people, and they were all &quot;meh&quot; about it. <br /><br />1) Bad name<br />2) Horrible eat-in ambiance/decor<br />3) Menu was too limited to mostly breakfast-type items<br />4) Overpriced for those said items<br /><br />Like someone else said, they did not have a strong identity. They didn&#039;t stand out for any reason, either with signature items or competing on price. They also advertised as an Italian and Mediterranean place and there is literally nothing about it that is that. <br /><br />Personally, I also disliked that sign they placed outside that stated they had the best acai bowls in NYC.

				I actually reached out to both Panera and Bareburger a couple of years ago to suggest JH as a great location--Bruson Building would have worked well. It was during the time when the community was attempting to influence what businesses would populate the reborn Bruson Building. <br /><br />Panera had zero interest in even responding to an email--I think they just said something to the effect of, thanks but no thanks, we have people here who research locations for us, don&#039;t call us, we&#039;ll call you....<br /><br />I exchanged emails with the founder of Bareburger, who told me he is from Astoria, and I think started the chain there, is devoted to Queens, etc--and that he may open in JH someday, but could not say when. <br /><br />

(I&#039;ve always wondered about the percentage of households that are single adults living together having been a single adult living with roommates for far larger than my friends in other cities)<br />https://bklyner.com/interactive-map-breaks-down-household-incomes-block-by-block-sheepshead-bay/ (https://bklyner.com/interactive-map-breaks-down-household-incomes-block-by-block-sheepshead-bay/)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />More facts.&nbsp; Interesting map.<br /><br />So maybe...3000 to 5000 people are a bit wealthier. Out of 110,000. <br /><br />Truly if I owned a business...I would make sure I cater to the 105K. Like the (successful) businesses do around here.<br /><br />It&#039;s a numbers game in my opinion.&nbsp; That&#039;s all. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I DO NOT want Bareburger here. Even though they are from Queens, they have no identity of wherever they are. They have excellent branding and menus, but it is sooooo sanitized.&nbsp; We have Emoji Burger - which has great burgers etc and it&#039;s totally local. Unfortunately it&#039;s so hard to open up an independent business here - I am so grateful to people who are brave enough to take a chance. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Maybe I should have written <em>lower</em>-income rather than <em>low</em>-income. Still, according to this median-income map (https://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nabes/ (https://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nabes/)), NYC had a median household income of $50,711 (according to 2010-2012 estimates). In Jackson Height/North Corona, that number was $46,119. Yes that&#039;s a large swath, and no doubt the incomes are higher than average in the Historic District. But those numbers are a small percentage of the larger area. How can it be otherwise?<br />

And there are so many variables. People talk about seniors on fixed incomes--but some that I know are actually quite well off on their fixed incomes. Those who have very nice pensions--former teachers, city workers, etc--plus social security and savings. One of my neighbors told me that retiring actually boosted her income.&nbsp; She travels and eats out--yes she is a senior on a fixed income, but not poor. <br /><br />Also not sure about the &quot;it&#039;s a numbers game&quot; claim--often offered with such smugness and certainty. I just attended a fundraising dinner that was very costly per ticket. A friend told me he had tried to persuade the organization to have a less fancy but more inclusive fundraiser: wouldn&#039;t they raise more money or at least the same amount if they had the event at a less fancy venue, and cut the ticket price so that many more people could afford to attend? <br /><br />It&#039;s for a synagogue, so there are all income levels in the membership, and many members would love to contribute to a fundraiser, are very passionate about the place, but the ticket prices are beyond the reach of many--although membership dues are fairly low--which bothers a lot of us quite a bit. They do not have their own building--so the big fundraising push is to get one and stop sharing limited space with a church.<br /><br />My friend said he could not persuade them to do that; evidently they raise more money with fewer attendees/higher ticket prices/more affluent people bidding higher on auction items. And for them, that&#039;s the bottom line: they need the money to get their own space. <br /><br />It occurs to me that this may be analogous to the topic of having a higher-priced retail option along with many lower-priced ones, as long as there are enough people who are willing to pay and can pay the price to support the business. <br /><br />I think E77 in its new, expanded form is an example of success in this regard. Business seems to be good--it&#039;s usually quite busy. Granted it is not on 37th Avenue, so the rent might be more reasonable. But if it were true that because this is such a &quot;poor&quot; neighborhood according to those data, a &quot;gentrified&quot; business like E77 cannot succeed here, then it would have closed long ago. <br /><br />He seems to know what he&#039;s doing in running the place, and with all the events he hosts--music, art, readings--I think it&#039;s a real asset to the community, not just a place to get a latte and a slice of pumpkin bread. I see people of many ethnicities in there, speaking different languages. Sure, someone on a very low income would not go there for a cup of coffee--but there are plenty of people in JH who can afford and do patronize the place regularly. And plenty of lower-priced places to get coffee and food. <br /><br />

				@jadasie it would so helpful to see the distribution curve, wouldn&#039;t it?<br /><br />Ultimately, this thread was about Fresh Spilt Milk and turned in to be about other restaurants that break the mold to serve a more affluent market (i.e. the Historic District). I don&#039;t really expect folks from North Corona to come to the historic district on the regular for dinner, just like I don&#039;t hit up Sunnyside or Flushing on the regular for casual dining out. Restaurants like the upcoming Queensboro, and the already established ones like E77, Armondo&#039;s, Uncle Peter&#039;s etc. I think are looking at a smaller area for regular repeat customers, don&#039;t you?<br /><br />As an aside, I&#039;m hopeful for a casual nice restaurant that I can get lunch in that does not involve either half a chicken or a steak.<br />

				If I&#039;m in the center of the historic district, I&#039;m not walking much past 85 or much below 74, or much past Roos or Northern to go somewhere to eat. I&#039;m sure restaurants know that most of their walk-in customers probably live a small number of blocks from their location. If I was going more than 10-11 blocks I could instead just hop on the subway and go to a different neighborhood and increase my choices. I&#039;m pretty sure a restaurant on 37th where Spilt Milk was is probably a very large percentage customer base from the historic district area. I&#039;m sure my own experience is in no way scientific though. Just a theory.

				@CaptainFlannel - I&#039;m all in favor of the Queensboro, along with any other upscale restaurants, bistos, bars, bookstores, and butchers that may wish to one day open in the neighborhood.

				Entrepreneur and small business owner are largely synonymous. However, within the business world, the term entrepreneur often carries more meaning: someone whose goal is continued business growth or an exit strategy for the founder through acquisition. Someone with an entrepreneurial bent is someone likely to have multiple business ventures, so they are less likely to be destroyed when things change (i.e.&nbsp; 3-hour photo mat, video rentals, etc.), who relies on others with expertise to run their businesses, and are pleased as punch when a bigger company wants to buy them out so they can focus on launching their next venture.

Keep supporting our local places and sooner or later &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; will see that there is money to be made in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Spilt milk jumped ship because the money wasnt there. there is no other reason why they didnt survive. Could it have been better? maybe, but they didnt have a chance to work out their kinks.

If the business wasn&#039;t making a money, it wasn&#039;t necessarily because there wasn&#039;t any money to be made. What you are describing is a lack of a business plan, yet what you have stated was the only reason the business failed was because there was no money to be made. New businesses have to be prepared to *lose* money for awhile, with a solid plan to build their business, identify inefficiencies, and build a customer base. None of what you have described indicates the only reason the business failed was because there wasn&#039;t money to be made by the business.&nbsp; What you have described is a lack of a business plan, and insufficient resources to weather the lean times as one launches a new business.<br /><br />I do know a bit about business. I know about business plans. And I do know that 60% of restaurants fail within the first year. Which is a pretty good reason to have a solid business plan in place before launching. https://articles.bplans.com/start-successful-restaurant-guide/<br /><br />&quot;You’ll need three pools of money. The first pool is for one-time costs like equipment (check out this calculator to help you figure out startup costs). The second pool is to cover the restaurant expenses for at least six months, and <strong>the third pool is to cover your personal bills for at least six months. You’ll want to have at least six months of cushion because you’ll probably find that your expenses outpace your revenue for at least that long.</strong>&quot;

				^lol. And you call me pedantic. Rich. <br /><br />My point stands, and is valid whether or not you like who the point is coming from. Businesses - especially restaurants - need to be prepared to lose money. The standard advice is to expect to lose money for 6-12 months. A solid business plan does look to the future btw, for money to be made. What was described in Alexnyc&#039;s post was two possible reasons for the business failure, contradicting his assertion there was only one.

				I will repeat myself since the one who lacks understanding seems to be someone else. You are saying you need money for atleast 6 months to cover costs. Do you know how long it took him to open? The problems he had with obtaining permits? After obtaining permits extra constructions costs that werent foreseen in your wonderful business plan. There is money to be made but he wasnt making any to cover the the loses that he accrued. Which is the same issues that stew ran into and the Queensboro. &quot;Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face&quot;

				^yes, six months is the advice for a minimum to have on hand as restaurant owners should expect to loss money for six months after opening. (sort of like how personal finance experts suggest having six months of monthly expenses on hand for job loss, but if you&#039;re smart you don&#039;t stop saving money for a rainy day once you reach that amount of money).<br /><br />I&#039;m disappointed for the owner, but to say there was no money as the only possibility flies in the face of reason. For example, one thing that was obviously a problem were issues with branding.

There is no reason to believe there&#039;s any problem with this business, unless they close shop. Until that day, which may never come, I don&#039;t see the need to start or continue any rumors that there is a problem. I personally find their pizza quite good.
