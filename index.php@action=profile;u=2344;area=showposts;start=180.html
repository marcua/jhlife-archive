					Hopefully this article will draw some more police attention to the problems that are happening on Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />What always strikes me is the contrast between Roosevelt Ave. and 37th - 34th Aves., just a couple of blocks north.&nbsp; What is causing these problems to remain (mostly) localized on Roosevelt?&nbsp;

					I, too, am worried about the potential for accidents especially since the city is not providing bike helmets.&nbsp; Someone recently said that since NYC is more safe for bikes now the need for helmets has diminished.&nbsp; Riiight.&nbsp; I drive and I bike and I see irresponsible bikers all the time.&nbsp; Even the responsible bikers aren&#039;t completely safe.&nbsp; (People riding down 34th Ave. are just waiting to get slammed by a door or hit by an idiot driver making a right hand turn without looking.)<br /><br />To the point of commuting to Manhattan with the city bikes - if we had them in JH I doubt that I&#039;d use it to bike into Manhattan.&nbsp; But I would use it to bike to Astoria / LIC which is supposed to be getting bikes.&nbsp; The bikes would be a great way to link JH with the waterfront, too!

					Didn&#039;t realize that it was illegal for them to be out on the sidewalk like that. &nbsp;My first thought when I saw that the section came down was &quot;where are they going to put all the chips now?!&quot; &nbsp;The store is crowded enough as it is.<br /><br />Now to get them to stop charging higher than the posted (ha!) prices and not to sell expired food - that should be where efforts are concentrated.

					That&#039;s good to hear about 77th St.&nbsp; We need a longer light on the north side of 75th St., too.&nbsp; Only about 4-5 cars can go through per green which is ridiculous given the amount of traffic down 75th St. now.&nbsp; Also, re-routing the buses down the street where Trade Fair parks its delivery trucks is a BAD idea.&nbsp; Those trucks are notorious for double-parking.&nbsp; A car can usually make it around but not a bus.&nbsp; This blocks the traffic all the way up the block.&nbsp; I&#039;ve called the 115th Precinct a couple of times about this but there&#039;s nothing they can do.<br />I also contacted the DOT, I&#039;m waiting for a response.<br />What led them to change the light on 77th St.?

					Over the past couple of weeks I&#039;ve seen a cat roaming around on 75th St.&nbsp; It looks to be either quite chubby or pregnant.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely not a kitten, the cat is at least a year and a half to two years old.&nbsp; The cat is grayish/brownish on top and white on the bottom.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this cat?&nbsp; It&#039;s always in the same place (on 75th St. just north of 35th Ave.).&nbsp; Does it have a home?&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t have a collar.

					A parking spot (or two, depending on the size of your car!) was taken away on the southeast corner of 75th &amp; 35th to make way for the bus turning.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think this spot is planned for a bus stop.

					I also live on 75th St. and didn&#039;t know about the traffic change until a couple of days before it happened.&nbsp; There were no signs up in our building, nothing sent through the mail, nothing.&nbsp; We were out of town for about 4 days and came home to the giant signs on 37th Ave. saying that the traffic would change direction that week.&nbsp; As a resident of 75th St. who finds myself reasonably aware of community issues I was shocked that there was no advance notice of this.&nbsp; And I can definitely see how some folks would have been left out of the discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, there&#039;s the possibility that people didn&#039;t know that buses were going to be re-routed and that the only change would be the direction of traffic.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t drive it probably was a non-issue until you found out that the buses were going to be re-routed.&nbsp; There was very little, if any, notice from the MTA that they would actually re-route the buses.<br /><br />There is a noticeable increase in traffic noise between the buses and cars honking.&nbsp; We hear this in our apartment even though we don&#039;t face the street - I can only imagine how those people with apartments facing the street must be frustrated.<br /><br />I was aware of the transit study (which was very well done, IMO); however, I only learned about it through this message board.<br /><br />Oh, and we lost a parking spot on my street, too.&nbsp; Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br />
