				I am pretty sure whomever is setting off huge colorful, illegal fireworks right now knows our police will do nothing and probably doesn&#039;t have to go to work soon.&nbsp; <br />Is there no law enforcement in Jackson Heights?

The sound is just so incredibly loud &amp; disruptive! But wow those fireworks sure are pretty...if only they could set them off LEGALLY on July 4th, then we wouldn&#039;t have to go all the way to the East River!<br /><br />A couple of Jackson Heights Life members posted in another thread here re: incident tonight &amp; on Sept. 7th (both happening between 2am-3am). One said that law enforcement from the local precinct IS on the way to investigate right now; <br />another posted there was actually an INSTAGRAM video posted from the party Labor Day weekend that initially set the fireworks off... Can the local authorities find the offending parties through that?<br />

				I hate these people so much. I wish I knew exactly where they lived so I could go wake their asses up right now. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re blissfully asleep, while I have to get up and work.

				I&#039;d like to take this moment to thank my white noise machine, because I slept through it and didn&#039;t hear a thing!&nbsp; Buying it has restored my sanity - I don&#039;t even hear the incessant honking on 73rd (which my bedroom faces) when I have it on.

I also do not hear anything at night, but only because I have still been running the AC and a fan (this has also helped me sleep in on heavy airplane noise weekends). Once cold weather rolls around I&#039;ll start hearing traffic and all this other noise, so I&#039;ve wanted to get a white noise machine. <br /><br />Sorry to derail the topic. I also hate these people for waking all of you up!
