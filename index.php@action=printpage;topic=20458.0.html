				Anyone recommend an optometrist? Would like someone who actually spends time doing an eye test and isn&#039;t in a rush (or trying to hawk me their overpriced glasses).&nbsp; <br /><br />I went to NY vision center on 77 by Roosevelt a couple of years ago, and while they were nice people doing good work, they had a huge line of people waiting, I felt rushed, and the tests were rudimentary (e.g. no tonometry, not microscopic examination of the eye)&nbsp; for someone who was a new patient - I don&#039;t think they got my baseline at all for a middle-aged person with long-term vision problems.<br /><br />Don&#039;t care about buying glasses (I buy online).&nbsp; Happy to pay for a better suite of tests and a prescription.<br /><br />e.g. the optometrist&nbsp; should have access to most of these tools....<br />https://www.goldenvisionclinic.com/vision-tools/

				I was happy with Dr. Park at Costco in Rego Park, but you&#039;d have to pay the $65 annual membership fee to see him if you&#039;re not already a member. I used to go to Shades of Vision near 76th St. and their equipment was not up to date.

				My recommendation is to go to an Ophthalmologist and get the tests done correctly. I go to NYU on 41st St and 2nd Ave and their staff is very nice and professional and they have state of the art test equipment. A refraction is $55, and your health insurance may cover most of the exam cost if you get a referral from your primary physician.

				I go to NYU also and like them.&nbsp; I used to see Dr Titone in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I thought he was very good, but he stopped taking my insurance.&nbsp; I saw an eye doctor on 35th once whose name I can&#039;t remember.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think much of him.
