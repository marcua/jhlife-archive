				<strong>El Coyote, the Mexican rest.</strong> that has been working on opening at 81st &amp; Northern seemingly forever may actually open soon... the place is beautiful and I think it will be good, based on the Web site for their CT. location.

				El Coyote is still &quot;waiting for its permits!... as far as I know. i wonder how much longer they can hang on in this credit climate. They applied for liquor license last April (2008). What is it w/ this town that these things take so long? Absolutely crazy.<br /><br />I hope they can hang in and open... their Web site makes it sound like they know the cuisine!

				FINALLY! I stopped by El Coyote today, on their long-awaited opening day, and the place was full of happy people, with more pouring in the door. I&#039;m not the only one to have been pressing my smudgy nose against their window all these months (we wrote in Sept. 2008 that they looked about ready to open). Others who trotted over from the nearby Towers co-op were greeted like old friends, so clearly these folks had been checking in regularly. Good to see that people had been looking forward to this attractive new eatery. (What a town... where else would a restaurant have to go through a year-long process to open?) We&#039;d already had dinner so we didn&#039;t eat at El Coyote, but will do so this week and let you know what we think.<br /><br />http://jacksonheights11372.blogspot.com/<br />

				I stopped by there today, but it was more extravagant than what we wanted for lunch. The menu looked fabulous, but it seemed the host wanted to just push me out with a take-out menu. Why oh why did they name it Coyote? Isn&#039;t that the term for an illegal human trafficker?? It just rubs me wrong.

				We were treated the same way. We went in to get a menu to see if they had kid friendly food as indicated on their website. I didnt see it on the menu and the prices seemed a bit high for a &quot;family&quot; meal. I&#039;ll wait to read some reviews before I waste my time.

				We ate here tonight, the staff is very nice. The guacamole is prepared at tableside, according to your taste. We added some extra lime juice, it was delicious. The salsa was very fresh as were the homemade tortilla chips. Another bonus for me was fresh brewed iced tea, no sugar added.<br />My husband had the Bistec Ranchero, which was a sirloin steak, butterflied into 2 pieces, grilled and served with sauteed poblano peppers and a mild red sauce. I had Chilies Rellenos, one stuffed with cheese and the other with shredded chicken. Both were served with yellow rice and black beans which were delicious. You had a choice of salad or white/yellow rice and black/red beans. We were very happy with our meal, which ended with fried ice cream and a Mexican hot chocolate(cinnamon flavored).<br />

				Gringo.........<br />Term used to refer to a foreigner in a latin-american country. Can be derogatory or not, it usually is derogatory when an article is used before it (Este Gringo.) Believed to have originated from the chant &quot;Green, Go&quot; shouted at US soldiers during the Mexican-American war, It actually originates from the Spanish &#039;Griego&#039; meaning greek. In spanish, the phrase &quot;Hablar en Griego&quot; or &#039;to speak in greek&#039; means the same as the english &quot;It&#039;s all greek to me.&quot; The word Gringo is an evolution of griego, which was used to describe any foreigner that had an accent that prevented them from speaking spanish; particularly the Irish. <br /><br />This can no way be compared to the&quot;N&quot; or &quot;S&quot; word and the historical stigma attached to both.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />- A Gringa from JH<br /><br />

				The menu looks similar, but not identical.&nbsp; I had cochinita pibil, which was delicious and does not seem to be on the Connecticut menu.&nbsp; Also, while the Jackson Heights location is kid-friendly, for some reason it does not offer a childrens menu.&nbsp; Hopefully they&#039;ll change that soon.

				Finally went to El Coyote and it was exceptionally good!!! Was seated right away, beautiful clean decor, service fantastic, chips and salsa was so fresh and homemade yummy!!! WE had fajitas, chimichangas, enchiladas, quesidillas all came with rice and beans or salad. The salad dressing was so000 delicious tasted like lime and possibly peanut? . The guacomole was to die for ( Im a guac snob) The rice was perfect not hard not mushy, black beans perfect not soupy but not dry either.&nbsp; The soup was also very good. Our water was constantly refilled without anyone being on top of us. We were not rushed to leave. We all had leftovers and were stuffed. WE already have plans to go back next week. I am so happy to have this restaurant here!!!!

				I ate there on Friday, with a friend and my 2 1/2 year old.&nbsp; Everyone LOVED it!&nbsp; I had the mole poblano, which was exceptional.&nbsp; My friend had a salmon preparation, which she said was one of the best pieces of salmon she has ever eaten.&nbsp; My daughter was pampered, and had rice and beans and chicken fingers and french fries.&nbsp; She loved mole when she was 13 months old, and hadn&#039;t had it since then.&nbsp; I admit I was saddened when she turned up her nose at it.&nbsp; But I loved it, and she ate well and had a great time.&nbsp; We also had the ridiculously decadent cherry/watermelon margaritas.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve had a margarita in 5 years, and it was really fun.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to speak to some of the earlier threads.&nbsp; Do we need ANOTHER Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood?&nbsp; Well, my feeling is that this place meets a really different set of needs than the taco stands and Coatzingo.&nbsp; If you want to eat great Mexican food standing on the corner, or listening to the soccer game, you can do that.&nbsp; If you want to be pampered in a really beautiful environment with first rate service, and eat great Mexican food, go to El Coyote.&nbsp; Is it targeted to gringos?&nbsp; Well, it is targeted to people with a certain amount of disposible income that they chose to spend on fine dining.&nbsp; As a gringa who lived in Mexico City for three years, (and yeah, I have no problem with the term &quot;gringo&quot;), I find that it reminds me of the upscale restaurants located in affluent Mexico City neighborhoods such as Polanco and San Angel.&nbsp; And yeah, the more touristy Zona Rosa.&nbsp; <br /><br />To make a similar argument, do we need Uncle Peter&#039;s and Armondo&#039;s when we have Gianni&#039;s?&nbsp; Yeah, we do.&nbsp; Gianni&#039;s is great when I&#039;m coming home with a bag of stuff from the Rite Aid and I&#039;m exhausted and have no desire to cook and I decide I want to sit down and have a great dish of pasta with the TV news in the background, while I catch up on neighborhood gossip.&nbsp; When I want to unwind and eat an exceptional meal, with exceptional service, in a pampering environment, I go and have a great dish of pasta at Uncle Peter&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am delighted to welcome El Coyote to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I will eat there frequently.&nbsp; And hopefully, my toddler/soon to be preschooler will start enjoying the mole again.&nbsp; She also loved pepian sauce as a baby, and I hope to get her enjoying it again as well.&nbsp;

				&nbsp; Drinks made with fresh juice are harder to make the difference between a drink made with sour mix and tequila, and a drink made with tequila, Cointreau or Triple Sec and fresh lime juice with amounts of simple syrup for frozen Margaritas is like night and day. And, there&#039;s no chemical after-taste. Of course, balance is critical. fresh juice is so concentrated that over-use will destroy the drink.&nbsp; Unfortunately El Coyote uses sour mix.&nbsp; :(<br />

				I&#039;m somewhere in between the Contessa and the divanatrix (never thought I&#039;d write that in my life).&nbsp; I went to El Coyote last night with some friends.&nbsp; While I think the food at Coatzingo is better and more authentic, I still liked the food at El Coyote.&nbsp; What it offered that is not available at Coatzingo is a more upscale dining experience which, from time to time, I enjoy.&nbsp; I also liked the fact that my evening started and ended at their bar.&nbsp; I like having a cocktail before I sit down. The bartender was very nice (and, yes, attractive) and I&#039;ll go back at happy hour just to hang. <br />When I order out or I want that no frills experience, or I want to impress a friend with simple authentic food, I&#039;ll choose Coatzingo.&nbsp; When I want a table cloth, nice decor, friendly service and good food, I&#039;ll choose El Coyote.

The real authentic mexican stuff is amazing like pozole, nopales etc... but not everyone would go, thats why the authentic stuff sticks to roosevelt because they know they will get bussiness from the hispanic community. .<br /><br /><br />I never hate on new food joints, im glad we have more instead of really crappy &quot;boutiques&quot;, discount stores, etc...<br /><br />

				I havent been to el coyote yet but I look forward to it. &nbsp;But I have to put in a good word for El Sol Azteca. &nbsp;It&#039;s the best Mexican I have found in the nabe. &nbsp;Much better than Coatzingo. &nbsp;Depending on who is cooking, the plates sometimes even look quite beautiful. &nbsp;The beans are delicious, an important test of any Mexican joint&#039;s mettle. &nbsp;

				&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked as a chef here and abroad for most of my twenties and still cater a party here and there but prefer cooking for the ones I love which I find much more rewarding.&nbsp; I moved to JH from Astoria over 6 years ago and in that time I have fallen in love with the local cuisine such as Peruvian, Thai, Indian, Vietnamese and Mexican which happens to be my favorite (hummmm... posole, tamales and mango margaritas) and I must admit I have become quite expert at preparing them all but when I get a craving for either Greek, Italian, Middle Eastern or even a great burger and don&#039;t feel like cooking I have to head over to Astoria not that it&#039;s a big deal I have a car but it would be nice to take a stroll in my own neighborhood for such cuisine.&nbsp; I agree with Queenskid that when you want authentic Mexican you head to Coatzingo I choose great food over frills any day but when I want a great dining experience and to be &quot;pampered&quot; I make reservation at La Grenouille or La Bernandin.&nbsp; I know we can&#039;t have it all here in JH but that&#039;s not going to keep me from dreaming ::)&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangia.......???? ?????.....buen apetito.....????? ???....buon appetito....???? ????&nbsp;

				Hey guys, let&#039;s stop talking adages and let&#039;s talk El Coyote food!<br /><br />Was there tonight for the first time.&nbsp; Very pretty inside, great service and good food.&nbsp; I tired the Ensalada de Aguacate...huge, and definitely enough for 4.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically chunks of avocado atop a bed of greens in this fabulous lite citrusy dressing with some pico de gallo mixed in.&nbsp; I love cilantro!&nbsp; After that huge salad, I could only think of ordering some kind of veggie, so I had the veggie fajitas.&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; I definitely recommend this place for a nice night out...a date, with friends or family.&nbsp; They also have those nice frozen drinks and a great looking dessert menu.<br /><br />Love it or hate it.&nbsp; Let&#039;s move the discussion along!&nbsp; :D

				so i finally stopped in on thursday night and, frankly, i don&#039;t see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />first thing i&#039;d like to point out: the service *is* extremely nice and attentive, and the waitpersons seem genuine about it, not forced at all.<br /><br />but the food? good. solid. not spectacular, not great, not worth a particularly long detour. we had the guacamole to start -- probably the best part of the meal -- and that dish, made tableside, is always nice. taquitos were cleanly fried but fairly dull, veggie fajitas pretty much the same (the spicing/flavoring on those was such that they could&#039;ve been a mix-veg dish at a chinese restaurant). the veggie mixture was a good bit varied than at most places. my chicken mole was pretty good . two nice pieces of thigh meat, but pounded paillard thin, and the mole seemed to be free from shortcuts.<br /><br />margs were kinda lousy. as griswold contessa pointed out, def. seems like sour mix is in there as opposed to the fresh squeezed juice promised on the menu. free glasses of mulled wine at the end of the meal was a sweet touch.<br /><br />all in all, a decent place. but from one visit -- and i would go again if prompted -- it just seems like an average mid-scale ny mexican place, the kind of thing you could find in pretty much any neighborhood. no, i am not saying &#039;it&#039;s just like chi-chi&#039;s fast food,&#039; just that there&#039;s nothing particularly &#039;wow!&#039; to me

				<em><strong>I stopped by today. &nbsp;The place is very pretty and well laid out. &nbsp;They used wood strips or laminate for the cubicle like dividers. &nbsp;The lighter wood accent on them were a nice detail. &nbsp;It had a nice and warm decor overall. &nbsp;The bar was nice looking and while it was empty looks like a nice place to have a couple of glasses of wine or a few beers and actually have a conversation beside who won the game. &nbsp;<br /><br />Had the mixed appetizer. &nbsp;The wings tasted different, not bad just seemed that the skin was thicker than I prefer. &nbsp;The plate had what I believe were mini flautas. &nbsp;They were crispy and it didn&#039;t taste greasy like in many Mexican joints I&#039;ve been to. &nbsp;It had the tortilla with the bean and melted cheese. &nbsp;It also had mini empanadas which is what I liked best out of the dish since I put some of the really fresh salsa on it. &nbsp;I noticed an appetizer they call sombreritos, (what we call tostosnes rellenos, green plantains with your choice of meat or shrimp) which are not a Mexican dish. &nbsp;Actually, I noticed a few items I would not categorize as Mexican.<br /><br />We had the 2 pork dishes..Can&#039;t recall the name. &nbsp;One was served on a banana leaf - It was pretty good. &nbsp;The wife had the pork in a sauce called Pilin I think. It was very flavorful and somewhat different than I&#039;m used to from a Mexican place. I think the sauce was added to it after they fully cooked it because it didn&#039;t taste like a sauce that simmered the pork. The rice was edible and the beans were in need of some flavor...like they were afraid of seasoning it. &nbsp;The pork was very tender but if you are looking for good margaritas you&#039;ll need to go somewhere else. &nbsp;The house Merlot was good and to my surprisewas <span class="bbc_u"><em>gato negro </em> </span> which I don&#039;t remember being good at all&nbsp; (must have been a good year &nbsp;;D ). &nbsp;I remember drinking <em>gato negro </em> many years ago and I ended using it to make sangria because it just wasn&#039;t drinkable. &nbsp; <br /><br />I would definitely go again since I did see some dishes that I would like to try. &nbsp;The place is pleasant, the pork dishes were very good (Wish I had the guacamole instead of the mix appetizers) but I usually won&#039;t recommend or judge a restaurant on just 2 or 3 dishes. &nbsp; &nbsp;I rarely eat pork in restaurants since I&#039;m usually disappointed but if you like pork, the dishes wont disappoint. My guys are working a few blocks away so I&#039;ll try something else this week. &nbsp;</strong> </em> &nbsp;

				The group Out Jackson Heights ate at Coyote on the 7<sup>th</sup>. We had a special ten dollar prix fixe meal. I ordered a chicken dish that was perfectly fine. It was not my weekly carbohydrate day, so I gave away my rice and beans to a friend. Because I only ate there that one time, ate only a main dish, and do not drink alcohol, I wouldnâ€™t want to make any sweeping generalizations, but the food was good and the atmosphere fine for socializing with a group of friends. They make some attempt at being vaguely upscale: One of the men wore a sleeveless shirt and the management lent him a promotional t-shirt to cover himself. The staff was cordial and helpful.<br /><br />(http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs167.snc1/6260_129470939107_510279107_3135459_728562_n.jpg)<br />Above is my friendâ€™s chicken dish, identical to what I ordered.<br /><br />(http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs187.snc1/6260_129470959107_510279107_3135460_3737074_n.jpg)<br />Above is a friendâ€™s steak dish.<br /><br />(http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs167.snc1/6260_129471089107_510279107_3135470_256736_n.jpg)<br />Above is another friendâ€™s plantain dessert.<br /><br />My pictures, as usual, can be viewed on Facebook in my photo album (http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=127863&amp;id=510279107&amp;l=54d84f317b) beginning with picture number thirty-nine (http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3135447&amp;id=510279107&amp;l=54d84f317b). Looking at them will give you some idea of the dÃ©cor of the place, and you can see what some of the guests drank as well. (A Facebook account is not required to view the pictures.)

				Jesse and I ate there tonight - perfectly good food. Yes, I know there are more &#039;authentic&#039; tastes to be had in the neighborhood, but sometimes you want Mexican food served on a nice plate, on a nice tablecloth, with real flowers on each table, in a nicely decorated space with no elevated subway rumbling by and television on. I love the places on Roosevelt Ave, but it&#039;s nice to find a neighborhood Mexican restaurant that&#039;s a bit more upscale. <br /><br />We split a half-pitcher of Sangria and had comfort food (chimichangas and chili relleno), although there are lots of other things on the menu we want to try. &nbsp;The service was friendly and attentive, and we&#039;ll definitely be back.

				I ate there yesterday for lunch. I agree with MarcusW: the food may not be the most authentic, but it was nevertheless very tasty and the atmosphere was a pleasant change of pace from the wooliness of Roosevelt Ave. I noticed the dinner prices seemed a bit high, but the lunch prices were reasonable.

				I went to El Coyote last night with husband and 4 kids.&nbsp; To my surprise the place was full.&nbsp; There were 4 large parties(including us) and several small tables of two as well as some at the bar.&nbsp; Mariachi was playing and it was a really fun atmosphere.&nbsp; The kids had a blast and they were so nice to the kids the band came over and played them a marcarena songs.<br /><br />We had the fajitas, black bean soup, plantain with chicken, guacamole, pork shoulder in banana leaf (forgot the official name) and the tortilla and ice cream dessert.&nbsp; Food was good and service was very good. The food could have been a bit spicier, so I will probably request it that way up front.&nbsp; The price was very reasonable and we had food to take home.&nbsp; (my kids do not eat so much)&nbsp; &nbsp;WE will go back again.&nbsp; Passes by today and not as busy but there were several tables full of customers.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have not been yet, try them out.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m glad to hear they had a nice dinner crowd.&nbsp; Went twice recently for lunch which is a huge bargain.&nbsp; The lunch special is $6.95 - delicious and, at that price, cheaper and better than McDonalds.&nbsp; On both occasions, we were the only ones in the restaurant.&nbsp; I really want to support them because I think the place deserves it:&nbsp; friendly service, good food, clean, pleasant ambiance, reasonable prices.
