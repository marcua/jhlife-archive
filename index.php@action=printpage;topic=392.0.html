				There&#039;s an interesting thread going on on chowhound right now with the above title. http://www.chowhound.com/topics/482786<br /><br />Some of the restaurants that people have mentioned (and not everyone is sticking to a &#039;top 5&#039; list, nor are they necessarily sticking to the exact borders of JH) are:<br /><br /><br />Spicy Mina&#039;s, Deshi Biryani, Rahjbog, Kebab King, Dosa<br />El Chivito D&#039;Oro, La Nueva Cafe, Inti Raymi, Urubamba, La Portena, Taqueria Coatzingo, Rincon Criollo, Pio Pio<br />Arunee, Rice Ave, Chao Thai, Sripraphai, Zabb, Thai Son<br />Jackson House, Ricky&#039;s, Jahn&#039;s, Texas Ranger BBQ<br />Espresso 77, Cannelle, Lety&#039;s, La Nueva bakery<br />Armandos, Sammy&#039;s Halal<br /><br />Any opinions?<br />

				I just posted this somewhere else - but I think Jardi&#039;s on Northern between 84 and 85 is great. Novo&#039;s is good food, they put alot of thought into the menu. Inti Raymi has the most amazing Lomo Saltado and ceviche I have tasted in a long time. Uncle Peter&#039;s on Northern is also good. Raj Bog on 37th between 72 and 73 is good for fast indian food.

				The salmon at Armondo&#039;s is always well prepared.&nbsp; Like their gnoochi too.&nbsp; Over on 37th Ave. by 60t Street is Saporo di Ischia (not sure of correct spelling).&nbsp; A really good, interesting Italian restaurant that is an Italian deli during the day.&nbsp; It also has a separate bar.&nbsp; Good home made pasta dishes and great wine by the glass.&nbsp; I like Arunee for Thai better than Sripraphai although when the weather is warm I love Sripraphai&#039;s back yard garden to have dinner in.

				wow. a chocolate cherry scone???&nbsp; my mouth is watering.&nbsp; I go to HSBC bank because for awhile their online savings rate was close to 5%!!!! It&#039;s recently come down but what a gravy train for awhile.&nbsp; Any way I lost my train of thought.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone into Expresso 77 cuz it&#039;s across the street but I never saw a chocolate cherry scone.&nbsp; And for you folks who spend the dough on buying coffee ground at Starbucks (I usually do) I tried Expresso&#039;s ground coffee and it was terrific.&nbsp; Not as bitter or burnt tasting as Starbucks.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting another pound.&nbsp;

				Sammy&#039;s!!! Number one in my list, nothing beats walking the streets of JH late at night after partying and sammy&#039;s is there for you lol.<br /><br />Espresso 77 - real barista that actually know how to work the bar instead of those starbucks people that just press buttons.<br /><br />La Portena - for Steak House<br /><br />Pollo Peruano - its on 82nd st and Roosevelt (probably no one will go out there lol) but I like there chicken way more than pio-pio&#039;s and its cheaper alot of hispanic prople are there usually but there hot sauce is amazing and so is the lomo plus its cheaper = better deal just up to you to get to 82nd and roosey. <br /><br />Ricky&#039;s: chicken marsala is good and cheap =D<br /><br />Maybe more for me but these are my top.<br /><br />

				I hightly recommend Deshi Biryani on 37th Avenue between 75th and 76th. I randomly stopped in there one day for lunch and had their lunch special. The curry they served was heads above anything else I&#039;d had in the neighborhood, so I kept returning and trying different dishes. Everything I&#039;ve had there has been top notch (with the curious exception of the large samosas). I am especially fond of the morgir roast and the kachi biryani. The staff is also extremely pleasant.<br /><br />I agree that Sammy&#039;s is a top 5 food choice in Jackson Heights. It&#039;s the most addictive food I&#039;ve ever eaten.

				<br /><strong>Kebab House</strong> -- (this is NOT Afghan Kebab House); a Bangledeshi place around 74th/Roosevelt on the corner.&nbsp; Looks rickety, tastes incredible.<br /><br /><strong>Pio Pio</strong> -- goes without saying, but I&#039;m saying it anyway.<br /><br /><strong>La CabaÃ±a</strong> -- excellent steaks and pizza (finally went and enjoyed it very much, thanks everyone)<br /><br /><strong>Jardi</strong> -- very good Tapas but I haven&#039;t gone in a few months because service was exceptionally slow one day.<br /><br /><strong>Taqueria Coatzingo</strong> -- one of the least seedy Taco chains on Roosevelt<br /><br />Honorable mention:<br /><br /><strong>Cafe La Nueva</strong> -- *love* the ChicharrÃ³n.&nbsp; Sometimes they cut it right off of the pig there in the restaurant.&nbsp; Everything else I could pass on.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this list will be completely different next month.<br />

				I&#039;m pretty new to the neighborhood - but i&#039;ve got to second the Taqueria Coatzingo. The tacos are the best!<br /><br />I&#039;m also a fan of Italian farms on 80th - though sometimes the guy taking my order doesn&#039;t really understand the term go heavy on the balsamic + oil.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of Jackson Diner - part of the reason I was drawn to Jackson Heights as a place to live.<br /><br />Does anyone know if the Japanese place on 37th ave between 80th and 81st is good? I forgot the name, but it looked ok.<br /><br />

				Check this thread (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=190.0) for some comments about Happy Kitchen - the Japanese place on 37th Ave between 80th and 81st.&nbsp; Note that some people really like a place called East 21.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried East 21 yet but have been pleased enough with Happy Kitchen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also there&#039;s a new place coming soon, Tomo, on 37th Ave around 86th.<br /><br />Welcome to the neighborhood~

				I like Happy Kitchen. They have brown rice so I always get it with my salmon teriyaki platter. And their sushi always tastes fresh to me. There are others but Happy Kitchen is closest to me so I tend to order take out from them a lot.&nbsp; It will be great to have another Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know when Tomo is opening.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you gone to Arunee Thai yet on 79th off Roosevelt?&nbsp; I still like it a lot even though there are tons of great Thai restaurants I still want to try.<br /><br />Jackson Diner and Delhi Palace are both terrific but I usually go mostly to Jackson Diner.&nbsp; I love the Jetson&#039;s look of the interior.

				Buddy, Pequena Colombia is the restaurant I mentioned to you yesterday.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a chicken place, but rather a full service, sit-down restaurant with an extensive menu offering Colombian meals ranging from sancochos (hearty soups) to grilled meats, fish and poultry.&nbsp; I prefer it to Tierras Colombianas.&nbsp; Untrue to it&#039;s name, Pequena Colombia is quite large in comparison to Tierras, offering better and more comfortable seating.&nbsp; With respect to food quality, Pequena also wins hands down in my opinion.&nbsp; They also have had live entertainment on occasion...guy with an acoustic guitar serenading folks while they dine.<br /><br />Side bar:&nbsp; When I do go to Tierras, I prefer the one in Astoria.&nbsp; It has more seating and it&#039;s nicer overall.&nbsp; Keep in mind that it does get crowded and can be a bit noisy as a result.&nbsp; The food is basically the same as the one on Roosevelt.&nbsp; We usually order the Paella for one, which isn&#039;t on the menu at Roosevelt.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty good.<br /><br />La Pequena Colombia<br />83rd and Roosevelt Avenue (northwest corner)
