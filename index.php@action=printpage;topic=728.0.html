				Recently moved to the neighborhood and loving it.&nbsp; Very shocked and surprised at the state of the building at 8410 34th Avenue!&nbsp; Does anyone know is this a rental building?&nbsp; Are the owners slum landlords?&nbsp; Is the building located within the historic district?&nbsp; Has anyone every tried to help and/or force the building to clean itself up?

				Griswold Girl, what&#039;s exactly wrong with the building?&nbsp; Is it dirty, graffiti ridden?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t walked by there recently, at least in the a.m., so I&#039;m not sure what building you&#039;re referring to.

				Yes, it is on the south side of 34th Ave.&nbsp; I have to go back and check the cross streets.&nbsp; Many windows are broken out on the ground level, which seems extremely unsafe to both the tenants and neighborhood residents alike.&nbsp; Anyone who wanted to could climb into their basement through various points of entry no problem not to mention rodents.&nbsp; The building has not been painted in what looks like 50 years, the yard is a patch of mud, trash about the lawn and the list goes on and on.&nbsp; It is a shame because the building is prewar and has so much potential but it is just wasting away.&nbsp; I was just curious its history and whether or not it was designated in the historic district if anything could be done to approve its appearance?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think that building is one of the few rentals left in the area. Another one recently got a full face lift and looks pretty over on 35th Ave. across from the Catholic Church bet. 82nd and 83rd. &nbsp;It would be nice if the owner fixed up this eyesore. &nbsp;

				Here&#039;s the map of the Historic District.<br />http://www.cb3qn.nyc.gov/?p=29789<br /><br />There are so many great buildings right outside the Historic District limits, and many buildings or houses within it that could be resotred.<br /><br />On a sidenote:<br />Does anyone know if there are rules as to what color ground-floor business awnings (doctor&#039;s office, etc.) have to be?<br />Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I&#039;m seeing some awful blue awning from doctor&#039;s office, etc.<br /><br />What about some of the awful neon lights from stores, on the numbered streets. Are they allowed, and is there a way to complain? On 37th Aves, it&#039;s totally reasonable, but on the side street, it just seems like a nuisance to ppl living across it.

				According to the DOB website, it does appear as if the building is a rental, and it is listed as being landmarked.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any recent violations posted there, but it could be that no one has reported them.<br /><br />Buddy, I know the building you&#039;re referring to on 35th.&nbsp; We walked by there earlier today and were pleasantly surprised with the improvements that have been made.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of plush grass, fencing and the overall area is clean.&nbsp; They did a nice job. :rockon:

				This building used to be wayyyy :o worst the one with the courtyards on 34th , now Vantage took over it and they know this is prime real estate in the neighborhood so I expect there will be more significant improvments , some of the apartments are available for rent on there website. Also, it&#039;s being landmarked so I expect this building to go in the same direction as the one on 35th ave did , which is now gorgeous compared to what it looked like before :) .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Rentals do seem to be particularly good at accelerated deterioration, specially if the landlord&#039;s concern is wholly concentrated on rent money (tenants are no less in blame either). If that building is a rental building chances are it will be a good candidate for the black sheep status (should I point out that it&#039;s more of a herd?), at least at 84th street.

				It seems as if Vantage may face some obstacles in its attempts at revamping some of the recently acquired buildings.&nbsp; A few rent stabilized tenants are complaining that Vantage&#039;s intent is to restore the buildings, but at the same time, proceed with unlawful methods and plans of eviction of the lower rent paying tenants in order to bring rents to higher market rates.<br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19493846&amp;BRD=2676&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=551069&amp;rfi=6<br /><br />Our community stands to benefit from Vantage&#039;s efforts if they indeed clean up some of the affected properties, but at what cost?&nbsp; If what the rent stabilized tenants are saying is true, who ends up picking up the broken dishes?&nbsp; This is a tough call.&nbsp; I certainly would prefer seeing the revitalization of some of the more lack luster buildings in the neighborhood, but it would be a terrible thing to see innocent and responsible rent paying tenants being harassed.&nbsp; Comments?

				I certainly don&#039;t mind the revitalization of the buildings Vantage acquired since a good number were an eyesore . But, the way I see it many of these difficult situations could have been avoided if some of the tenants knew the rules. Coming from a family of immigrants, i see that a lot of these displaced tenants are immigrants that are innocently ignorant to the rules , such as having to have everyone who lives in your apt on the lease , or tenants who rent the rooms in their apt to make ends meet . Which is unfortunate , but, rules are rules and Vantage of course doesn&#039;t want to lose any money in the process. What does seem very shady and unfair is the claims that there tenants live elsewhere, this I still don&#039;t understand completely. I just hope whoever is right wins&nbsp; :police:&nbsp;

				The building I used to live in when I was in Sunnyside was taken over by Vantage, and while they did renovate and make a lot of aesthetic improvements,&nbsp; the renovations were pretty low budget and cheap.&nbsp; I saw some of the &#039;renovated&#039; apartments before I left and they were pretty crappy.&nbsp; They seem to be breaking into all of our up and coming neighborhoods though.&nbsp;

				<br />What did the apartment looked like before was it renovated?&nbsp; I would guess that the unit looks much better then it did before.&nbsp; Vantage is no different than many landlords out there...they are in it for the money and not for their health.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vantage does invest in the overall aesthetics of the property and I have been inform that they perform their own renovations...cookie cutter style, but renovations nevertheless.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal here...tacky maybe, but not illegal.&nbsp; They buy tons of properties that they have identified to have a good balance of non-stabilized rental units and they spend the $$$ where is needed.<br /><br />On another note:<br /><br />Many people look at landlords as the bad guys but most RE holdings and conglomerates avoid the strict hand of the NYC agencies and will invest the minimum required at least to avoid major violations.&nbsp; True that some of these landlords are borderline criminals that refuse to make any type of renovations because they are hoping for the &quot;rent-stabilized&quot; tenant fed up and leave.&nbsp; I have worked for some of those fellows as well&nbsp; :&#039;( .&nbsp; There are many apartments out there that pay a small fraction of what the market can fetch.&nbsp; &nbsp;While rent controls have pretty&nbsp; much gone the way of the dinosaur (once the stabilized unit becomes vacant the landlord has many ways to improve and increase the rental price) we as a free people can choose to live where ever we choose to as long as the resources are available.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is that many find themselves displaced from a particular area they really want to stay in or live in.&nbsp; <br /><br />When people find themselves priced out of a neighborhood the unfortunate victim of capitalism and circumstances will find ways to blame and dehumanize the landlord or the government or my great grandma who&#039;s been dead for a million years.&nbsp; Hey, some of us don&#039;t want to go back to the South Bronx, I don&#039;t care how hot or improve the area may be becoming.&nbsp; This is simply our human condition.&nbsp; The hardest thing to control in this world is our emotions.&nbsp; We may have a great poker face but we are a potpourri of emotions ready to burst at any moment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Taxes, transportation, fuel cost, wars, government or regulatory agencies as well as wages, construction and maintenance continue climbing and just as we are affected so are landlords, big or small.&nbsp; Hey, someone has to pay the piper people.&nbsp; When companies like Vantage come to an area they come because they have identified opportunity just as you and I identify opportunities that can enrich our financial lives.&nbsp; The byproduct of a large infusion of capital in a building will obviously need to be justified just as when we infuse thousands of dollars into medical bills, education and our families.&nbsp; Bottom line, they may do it for money and when &quot;WE&quot; don&#039;t do it for the money we may do it for personal satisfaction.<br />

				One thing Vantage did NOT do at several of the properties they purchased in the historic district was to abide by landmark preservation rules.&nbsp; The building on 35th Ave. diagonally located from St. Joan of Arc church had a beautifully sculptured iron trellis at the entrance of the front garden which was dumped in the garbage.&nbsp; The gate they put up is much too high and the pointing a catastrophe.&nbsp; While these buildings look &quot;cleaned up&quot;,&nbsp; they (i.e.Vantage) ultimately did what they wanted without respect to the community as a whole.&nbsp; By the way, I believe the building at 8410 is called the Boswell--It&#039;s a rental, too bad Vantage didn&#039;t purchase that too----it&#039;s NOT in the historic district and any improvement would be greatly noticeable. the cobblestone tree pit which lines the ave. seems to be a magnet for dog walkers who don&#039;t pick up!

				I believe the building at 84-10 34th Avenue is called the Boswell.&nbsp; It&#039;s a rental, which looks totally neglected and run down from the outside.&nbsp; It probably was quite nice in its&#039; hey day.&nbsp; &nbsp;The apartments each have a little outside terrace area. I think if this building is to see real change it has to come from the inside. The tenants, that is.

				Just happened on this 3-minute youtube video showing two apartments and the courtyard of a building at 83rd and 34th. The courtyard is huge, with no landscaping and with at least a few arched passageways that go directly from the courtyard to the street.&nbsp; Is this the building the OP is talking about ?<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu5SH155rks

				<strong>APG...You are right.&nbsp; 8410 has no back Yard or court yard.&nbsp; It does however have an indoor garage.&nbsp; You cant miss the side entrance with graffiti.&nbsp; Its a shame, the building has two wings, elevators and steps as well.&nbsp; Theres 35 or so units in each wing&nbsp; (about 70 units toal)and each wing has its own mail boxes.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually not horrible inside but needs to be updated.&nbsp; I would install recessed lighting, restore the terrazzo floors and repaint with same or similar scheme.&nbsp; I hate the green stairs but I like the fire escapes hidden; they almost look like they were terraces.<br /><br />Someone mentioned potential and it absolutely has it.&nbsp; At this time it is an eyesore with its broken windows and doorways, I could see the meters from outside!!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I have attached pictures for those that want to see the bldg :tickedoff:</strong>

				The super in this building takes better care of the 84th Street side than he does the 85th - at least in the summer.&nbsp; I see that the turquoise picket fence had been removed in the last few days. Wonder what that means.<br /><br />The super and at least one woman in the building are also major offenders of letting their dogs poop on private property (including their own!) and letting them run off leash.

				My friend used to park in this building garage (he did not live there).&nbsp; The garage was disgusting.&nbsp; There were garbage cans that were never emptied and&nbsp; the rodent sightings were almost as common as waiting on the platform for the F train.&nbsp; There was glass from broken car windows that would stay there for months.&nbsp; After three break-ins of his car he finally decided the privilege of paying $100 a month to park there wasn&#039;t worth it and he put the car back on the street.&nbsp; It was safer and cleaner.
