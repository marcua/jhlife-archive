				It takes two to tango. I see very little hope for this country if the two sides can&#039;t abandon their dogma and try to find some common ground from which to at least start a conversation.&nbsp; We don&#039;t need any more politicians, what we need are some statesmen/women who will put their country ahead of reelection, partisan politics, and the usual collection of stupidity that passes for government these days.&nbsp; <br /><br />At this point I honestly wonder if the best way forward is schism, perhaps there are really far too many differences than there are commonalities to keep the nation together as one.&nbsp;

				Her 70% marginal tax rate proposal is really quite modest (too modest in my opinion). For those who rake in more than $10 million, only income above that would be taxed at 70%. Anyone who thinks that&#039;s a slippery slope to the gulag or Venezuela is a moron.

				Are we also going to tax corporations at 70%? You have to if you follow that logic. Corporations taxed at a very high level will move their headquarters out of the USA. The world is moving to lowering taxes on corporations not raising it. It is a global economy now and no longer a USA economy like in the 1950’s.

				Even Paul Krugman says this is a good idea and he tends to be pretty measured in his evaluations. Basically, most very wealthy people make money off the gains on their investments. Most people don&#039;t understand this concept because they are used to getting paid for work they do. <br /><br />So, only earned income is taxed at 70% and the above 10 million set will still thrive because capitol gains are taxed at a lower rate. Which will probably be targeted in a future republican administration. <br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tax-policy-dance.html

				&nbsp;I know it is a different topic altogether but...but if she tried some incremental changes I believe it would happen faster and<br />make more of an impact long term. My suggestion is the one of many in the medical profession. Lower the Medicare <br />eligibility rates to 55yrs. This way the health care system can take on the segment of population most in jeopardy with<br />health care and often in the highest need. Lowers costs for everyone else. Employers can start giving more benefits<br />until we move towards a single payer system if that ever happens. Also allow rich people to get off Medicare or off <br />Social Security if they make above a certain figure that would cut off at upper middle class top rates. Smaller steps<br />please!<br /><br />&nbsp;I think that in this day and age, rich people move their money around when the taxes get raised and I don&#039;t see them<br />sitting around to pay this 70% tax rate. Not with all the other ways to avoid it internationally. But I could seeing them <br />walk from SS payments if they were above the cutoff along with avoiding Medicare which they could afford to lose also.<br /><br />&nbsp; Also please try to divert the spotlight or share it with the many other new members of Congress who also have compelling<br />stories of how they got there. Just seems like the nice thing to do, locally maybe include Max Rose for example. Long term<br />support of colleagues can make a difficult thankless job much easier if you join forces.<br />

I do like the wacky ideas AOC comes up with because it is very amusing. It is like a car wreck that never gets old. There will never be enough money from the “wealthy” to pay for all the new social programs that she can dream up. BTW, you can tell she never ran a business or paid much if any taxes.

				AOC has her inaugural address in the Bronx. She speaks about how Queens deserves better than a miserly 25k+ jobs that pay an average of 150k from Amazon. Scraps from the Amazon table? Has AOC ever paid any significant income taxes? no. Has she ever created one job? No way She still goes around telling people that now NYC can invest the $3billion it was going to give Amazon in Queens. Except that $3 billion doesn’t exist. Very sad that a neo communist has taken over the Democratic Party. <br /><br />https://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny-metro-aoc-inauguration-amazon-20190216-story.html

				What I don&#039;t understand is that both our Mayor and Governor said that for every $1 of subsides to Amazon would generate $9 return to both the City &amp; State or $27 Billion Dollars.&nbsp; Imagine what the State &amp; City could do with $27 Billion Dollars.&nbsp; I&#039;m at a loss at understanding the opposition against Amazon.&nbsp; The City &amp; State weren&#039;t actually writing a check to Amazon for $3 Billion but offering tax incentives over a period of decades.&nbsp; The Politicians who opposed Amazon are beyond irresponsible and incompetent and have done enormous damage to NYC.&nbsp; They having nothing to be proud of and neither do those individuals who opposed Amazon.&nbsp; You did absolutely no harm to Amazon who sent you a message that they don&#039;t need a presence in NYC.&nbsp;

				While I don’t agree with the new green deal, AOC has been a Democratic Party superstar. She has excited many people about free college and healthcare for anyone present in the US. She is actually getting more attention than old limousine liberal Pelosi. She is setting the agenda. We don’t know what Pelosi is even “for” except she has been around a long time congress.

				Term limits and publicly funded elections.&nbsp; No more donations from anyone, and all running get the same amount of cash at each stage of the election process.&nbsp; The latter just might help stop politicians from spending half or more of their time running rather than doing their job.<br /><br />As it is now, wealthy donors are able and inclined to pay for much more &quot;speech&quot; than the common people and are hence able to inflict their own self-righteous we-know-better-than-you viewpoints on everyone else a la Koch brothers, Bloomberg, etc.&nbsp; And add to that, why should anyone that doesn&#039;t live in that locality/state be able to fund who is running there?&nbsp; They don&#039;t live there, it&#039;s none of their business.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for the Green New Deal, all the restrictions seem to be a &quot;for thee, but not for me&quot; deal.&nbsp; I&#039;d respect it and its proponents more if they chose to lead by example and live it wherever possible rather than telling others they can&#039;t eat meat while they are dining at steakhouses, etc.&nbsp;

				Ok, so I didn&#039;t want to spend too much time on this cuz I already know pretty much how my neighbors feel about AOC and I didn&#039;t want to stir the pot. But this minidoc is so precisely accurate that I am compelled to share. I don&#039;t know who this narrator is, but it doesn&#039;t matter to me cuz I had already acquired on my own 98% of the same info. I DO think that Cenk is still very much at the base of the JusDems&#039;s power, and do not buy the BS that he (and Kyle Kulinski) quit--just days before the 2018 election filing period began because of past misogyny statements. And I know Cenk has denounced his past denial of the Armenian Genocide and hired Ana Kasparian, but I think that&#039;s for show. You can tell I don&#039;t trust TYTs.<br /><br />The narrator gets a little exuberant about Saikat&#039;s money transfer scheme. I was a bit lukewarm about it myself, but since Saikat is so creative, I won&#039;t put anything past him.<br /><br />It is not conspiracy theory. (I am softer on her as the &quot;actress&quot; as she does have experience with Bernie and Kennedy and Marxist ideology. I also think Riley Roberts should get credit for marketing her.) I honestly came to the same conclusions on my own.<br /><br />Enjoy. <br /><br />https://theblacksphere.net/2019/03/solved-the-mystery-of-aocs-rise-to-power/

All concerns previously expressed on this forum.<br /><br />I removed my reference to a certain clip so as not to upset some folks.<br /><br />This was a Town Hall, tonight in Corona. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4820911/representative-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-town-hall-meeting-paul-eliason<br /><br />Still don&#039;t know how one finds when/where these THs are going to happen.<br /><br />EDIT to ADD: AOC posted an announcement 1 hour prior to the event, did not specify location, but did advise that the TH was full.

				I disagree with so many of the posts here. This district is hardly a hotbed of left wingers. I voted for her as a fresh face. I&#039;ve lived in JH for almost twelve years and didn&#039;t even know Joe Crowley was my representative. He was not paying proper attention to his district. Yes, she has a strong media presence nationwide but also seems to be reaching out in these town halls. She is new at this. She&#039;s very smart and will learn to moderate a bit as she figures out how to get supporters for her legislative ideas. Even if she does nothing more than introduce the concept of a Green New Deal, she&#039;s accomplished a LOT. Yes, it is more aspirational than realistic; but agree with her or not, she has IDEAS. More than we can say for so many of the warm bodies in the legislature.

				&nbsp;Wow, I am surprised at the previous poster Fillmore Rep not knowing about Crowley. He was everywhere in the District when he was in office. I saw him lots and would introduce myself and express concerns. I see AOC on tv but like other posters mention, she isn&#039;t around the hood which I know is due in some part to security not being provided for her (Crowley wasn&#039;t in the same danger) and that fact that she didn&#039;t want unpaid staffers so is currently overwhelmed in her offices without interns to pick up much of the routine work. <br /><br />&nbsp; That said, it feels like she is good on the national stage, maybe great even, but local not so much. I do think she will be beatable for the next election. On the count that people like their local electeds to be responsive, which by many accounts, she has not been. She seems to be trying to change this but it may be too late and the strategists that selected her may have others to put in the pipeline for offices as her popularity will propel her into something national, no doubt. If the census results are low for this area, we may lose a seat anyway and it would be her spot, as the newest and youngest. For this reason, I was surprised she hasn&#039;t been more vocal right out of the gate on being counted as opposed to the efforts with the Green New Deal as a much bigger, but very worthy, national and international project.

				i see AOC in the neighborhood a lot, far more often than i saw Crowley. maybe that&#039;s because her office is in the Bruson Building, and we live a couple of blocks from that. but i see her on the street, engaging constituents, on a regular basis.<br /><br />Crowley was responsive when push came to shove, and he was good at town halls, but i see AOC as being more interactive so far.

				I think AOC has been a refreshing voice on the national stage.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I agree with fillmorep that her work championing the Green New Deal and getting it into the national conversation is a great and worthy achievement for someone at the start of her Congressional career.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure I agree with everyone&#039;s diagnosis of why she defeated Crowley.&nbsp; &nbsp;Crowley did have a presence in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw him at meetings often, and in fact just saw him yesterday at Espresso 77.&nbsp; &nbsp;And I don&#039;t think very many people found his voting record objectionable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps not as progressive as some would like, but certainly in the mainstream for a Democrat (according to this link (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2018/house/ideology) he had an ideology score of 0.31, with 0 representing the most liberal member of Congress and 1 representing the most conservative).&nbsp; &nbsp;But he had definitely become a creature of Washington.<br /><br />I think for many, the real objection to Crowley was his corrosive impact on local politics through his running of the Queens Democratic Party machine.&nbsp; Over and over again, emerging leaders who were starting to get active in politics as an extension of their work to better the community found their way blocked by a party machine that demanded loyalty above all else (and championed useless foot soldiers like Moya and DenDekker).&nbsp; So last year, when AOC (along with Catalina Cruz and Jessica Ramos) ran energetic, reformist, insurgent campaigns, a lot of people were excited to see the new energy and ideas they were bringing.&nbsp; &nbsp;And when Crowley decided he was too good to debate his opponent or take her seriously, a lot of people decided his time was up.

				&nbsp;The par-tay is at Bernie&#039;s! Let&#039;s hope that if by some miracle he is the nominee, he will be more inclusive and try to rally all eligible voters, not just ones that are 100% on board with his policies. His campaign last election was rude as all get out to other constituents, like working people whose points of views were not exactly aligned with his. And his reluctance to ask his people to vote for Hilary had to have played some role in us having President marmalade now.<br /><br />&nbsp;Props to his social game though...

				These political ideological battles always play out with power struggles and how to maintain power when it comes to the real world. <br /><br />And political ideology takes second place...or is simply a lip service to maintain that power.<br /><br />Whether socialist/communist or right wing.<br /><br />
