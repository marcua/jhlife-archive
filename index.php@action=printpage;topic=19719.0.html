				The 2020 Census gets underway in a couple of weeks!<br /><br />It is essential that our neighborhood is fully and accurately counted -- every adult and child residing here, regardless of citizenship status.&nbsp; These counts are the basis of important decisions regarding representation in government, school districting, and distribution of government services and resources.&nbsp; Over the coming weeks, there will be extensive efforts to reach out to the community to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to respond.&nbsp; This thread is for posting information about those efforts.&nbsp; Discussion of the politics surrounding the census should go elsewhere (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17659.0)).<br /><br />Here are some basic resources to start: <br />Article on NYC&#039;s plans to boost Census turnout (https://www.citylab.com/life/2020/01/new-york-census-undercount-response-2020/604225/)<br />Ocasio-Cortez, Miranda Use Star Power to Promote NYC Census (https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/ocasio-cortez-miranda-use-star-power-to-promote-nyc-census/2304634/)<br />NYC&#039;s Census Webpage (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/census/index.page)<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in helping with outreach, the city especially needs volunteers who can talk with some of the limited English proficiency residents of the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can fill out this form to volunteer:<br />https://www1.nyc.gov/site/census/get-involved/join-the-get-counted-team.page<br /><br />

				Received from the NYC Census office:<br /><br /><br />Dear Census Advocate,<br /><br />At this incredibly trying time, we hope you and your family and neighbors are all staying healthy and safe. In this challenging time where it feels that so many things are out of our control, I want to let you know about something positive you can do for your community. The Census has officially launched and New Yorkers like you can complete the census online or on the phone from the safety of their own home. You can fill it out online at my2020census.gov (http://my2020census.gov/) or over the phone at 844-330-2020. Remember, census funds are not only linked to funding for Medicaid, children’s health insurance and hospitals, but moreover the NYC Health Department uses census data in emergencies to determine responses. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the best part: you also can encourage your fellow New Yorkers to fill out the census by signing up (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckCpLPkitfRo_eb0RkghgXgSZHNTgL1Nn4S2SxK1VDPyde6w/viewform) to participate in our upcoming citywide &quot;Text Out The Count&quot; campaign from Sunday, March 22 to Monday, March 23. Using our peer-to-peer texting tool, Hustle, you will be able to reach hundreds of New Yorkers within minutes with a text encouraging them to fill out the census and providing the link to the Census Bureau’s self-response website.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can do it from home and all you will need is either a phone, a laptop, or a tablet to participate. Sign up here and we will get you all set up to “Text Out The Count!”<br /><br />Together, as we weather this crisis, we can help New York City during its time of need. <br /><br />With much thanks,<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Julie Menin<br />Director, NYC Census 2020

				Queens is up to a 59% self-response rate.&nbsp; &nbsp;We need to do better!<br /><br />The deadline for responding to the Census has been extended to September 30th, 2020 and it is available in 13 different languages.<br /><br />Our city needs your help to count everyone in the United States by providing basic information about all adults and children living or staying at your address.<br /><br />Results from the 2020 Census will be used to:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Determine the number of seats each state has in the United States House of Representatives &amp; your political representation in the city, state, and federal government</li><li>Draw school district boundaries</li><li>Forecast future transportation needs for all segments of the population</li><li>Plan for hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and the location of other health services</li><li>Forecast future housing needs for all segments of the population</li><li>Establish fair market rents and enforcing fair lending practices</li><li>Direct services to children and adults with limited English language proficiency</li><li>Plan health and educational services for people with disabilities</li><li>Design public safety strategies</li><li>Assess the potential for spread of communicable diseases</li><li>Develop assistance programs for low-income families</li><li>Medical research</li><li>Determine areas eligible for housing assistance and rehabilitation loans</li><li>Attract new businesses to state and local areas</li></ul><br />The Census Bureau is using the internet to securely collect information. Responding online (www.my2020census.gov) helps conserve natural resources, save taxpayer money, and process data more efficiently.<br /><br />If you are unable to complete your 2020 Census questionnaire online, you may complete the questionnaire by telephone, by calling: 844-330-2020.<br /><br />The Census is required by law by everyone living in the United States and its five territories. Because attaining a complete and accurate census count is critical, if you do not respond, a Census Bureau interviewer may visit your address as part of their community outreach.<br /><br />As a reminder, your answers to the census are kept completely confidential as required by law.<br /><br />The 2020 Census is more than a population count – it is an opportunity to shape your community’s future.<br /><br />This really makes a difference.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don’t forget to encourage your friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers to respond as well.

				59%? That&#039;s terrible.<br /><br />And undercounting means less resources for those who need it.<br /><br />I suppose folks are scared these days to be counted in &quot;official&quot; ways... the undocumented, for example. <br /><br />Unfortunately,&nbsp; I would say that no amount of coaxing would get folks to be less scared of being deported due to the census in today&#039;s climate.&nbsp; Especially because the questions themselves ask so pointedly about Hispanic origins.

				Jackson Heights has a good response rate compared to the rest of the city (and maybe comparable to the rest of the nation). Combined with Census workers going door-to-door, our zip code may be well represented. But of course, our congressional district isn&#039;t just zip code 11372.<br /><br />One way to help is to be willing to act as a proxy for a household that didn&#039;t respond. If all you know is that 10 people live on the second floor of the apartment next to you, that&#039;s better than no information. Just answer the census worker&#039;s questions when they approach you to see if you know anything about the house or apartment next door. Even if your answer is &quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot;

				Actually, does anyone know why the &quot;Are you Hispanic?&quot; question is on the census?<br /><br />In 2020, unfortunately, it does look like it is targeting a specific group.<br /><br />(If Nazi Germany asked in their census, &quot;Are you Jewish?&quot;....I might also imagine folks avoiding that census too.)<br /><br />Yes, I know by law the answers are private. But we all have a feeling nowadays that laws might be circumvented and challenged.

				I took care of my census on line as soon as I received the first notice. After that comes more mail, door knockers and phone calls telling me to do what I have already done. I know others who have the same experience. I seem to remember similar things last time around too. I believe it is important to cooperate.

People enter the wrong case number. The mail man mixes up the questionnaires so the one for 2B ends up in 7D&#039;s mail box. A family buys a house that had three apartments in it and converts it in to a one family house. A basement apartment returns to just being a finished basement. The books can list units at 99-99 Anywhere St. and 99-99 Anywhere St, 1F. Since the Census didn&#039;t catch one of those very likely duplicates, someone is going to knock on a door. 10 years ago there was a phase of the Census that just worked on confirming housing units before the questionnaires went out. Far as I know, that didn&#039;t happen this time around. (Gee, wonder why?)<br /><br />Let&#039;s keep in mind the Census happens every ten years. I tend to think because of that, expecting the Census to have its act all together for the big count that occurs over a few months every decade is sort of a big, unreasonable ask.<br /><br />Take the 5 minutes to call the 800 number you get on the Notice of Visit. It clearly states if you don&#039;t do, you&#039;re going to get another visit in 2 days.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also there is the issue of undocumented people here in JH.

It&#039;s more a question of which areas are disproportionately under-counted. Not surprisingly, it&#039;s the areas with a big undocumented population. And with an executive branch that wants that population under-counted, that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to act as a proxy when you can.

				^which is why everyone who was comfortable and could have cooperated with the Census enumerators should have. I&#039;ve done the work myself, and it&#039;s frustrating how many neighbors will say they actually knew some basic information -- like how many people lived at an address -- but when you asked them to act as proxy, will decline. Even when you explain they can absolutely provide basic information and how it helps the community get funding and representation.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like you become responsible for paying the income taxes of the people you act as a proxy for.
