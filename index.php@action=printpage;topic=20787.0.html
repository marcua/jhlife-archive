				&nbsp;So much debate has happened with 34th Open Streets. Can anyone please answer why the ave is <br />closed when it is pitch black out at 7:00 on a cold night? With proper data collection, this could be<br />right sized so that the timing of the closures matches usage, need and common sense safety. How<br />many streets are closed at this hour besides 34th Ave which is not well lit and is mostly residential?

				&nbsp; Thanks ChickenringNYC. It&#039;s an ominous sign that our current electeds and those on the way out - and the way in - are avoiding a town hall style debate here. Any format will do but both the sides of always open <strong>vs.</strong> always closed <strong>vs</strong> some common sense usage needs to be properly debated if the neighborhood can withstand this change. The fact is that Open Streets are great for some, some of the time. And not really so great for others and they tend to be impacted more hours. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The army of people who want to make this &quot;their project&quot; and have their names attached is equally scary. But the immediate concern I have is the lack safety and visibility on these dark, cold and sometimes rainy nights is that 34th Ave is desolate and the lack of vehicular traffic makes it unsafe for residents living on the ave or nearby.

				&nbsp;Captain Flannel, do you have any data collected? We are near 34th and see it many hours of the day/night. Our eyes might not be perfect but it is a long, long stretch to say the street gets consistently decent use all 13hrs a day, seven days a week, in sun and rain, heat and cold. Really??&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Even the busiest of businesses can now produce algorithms that show their busiest times and the lulls. Why is there so much resistance here to say that some of time, and I repeat, some of the time, it&#039;s just not busy and in fact there are a number of times it is empty. Fact. Let the streets cameras show us the results, please. What is there to hide? Otherwise, this would be a history making project for having supposed 100% support by all residents for every aspect of a public project. Who could really believe that is true?

That no-one ever changes their mind. Ever.&nbsp; No matter how much debate or logic or persuasion by posters. I believe that in the history of the internet, not a single person has been swayed by the arguments of another poster. <br /><br />It seems to be an immutable law. On the internet, a mind that&#039;s made up...stays made up.<br /><br />This includes politics, open streets, plane noise etc, etc. You name it.<br /><br />Thank you to this forum for teaching me the important lesson...that it is futile to counter...or even debate... with people online.<br /><br />Mostly, that only leads to anger from others that their world view is not being upheld. <br /><br />As this forum comes to a close...I reiterate that this wonderful learning curve, (the forum) has been invaluable. For my future online. Much appreciated to everyone for teaching me.<br /><br />I have also learned that being online is, however, excellent to giving voice to a person&#039;s own opinion. As long as they don&#039;t expect&nbsp; to change others&#039; mindsets. Which I definitely now have much experience in knowing is impossible in an online environment. <br /><br />And also being very aware that some folks get very mad at you when you don&#039;t agree with them.<br />(Psychologically, somehow, online, their world view is threatened)<br />&nbsp;<br />That being said, <br /><br />HOORAY for the OPEN STREET OF 34TH AVE. It is the exact right size IMO.<br /><br />And HOORAY for the life long lessons I have learned on this online forum...which I will take into the future!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Indeed, this forum post perfectly encapsulates the futility. OP didn&#039;t ask &quot;Can anyone please answer why the ave is<br />closed when it is pitch black out at 7:00 on a cold night?&quot; because OP really wanted an answer for why. OP already knows why. It&#039;s just that OP disagrees with the answer, and instead of wanting to come to some kind of understanding other people&#039;s POV on the subject, just wants an opportunity to tell the people who answer they are wrong.<br /><br />It&#039;s transparent, and is an example of a bad faith discussion.

It&#039;s just that OP disagrees with the answer, and instead of wanting to come to some kind of understanding other people&#039;s POV on the subject, just wants an opportunity to tell the people who answer they are wrong.<br /><br />It&#039;s transparent, and is an example of a bad faith discussion.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am, however, curious if the OP really can&#039;t tell that everyone is fully aware of the OP&#039;s ploy.<br /><br />We are, all of us, &quot;online savvy&quot; nowadays...even little kids are in 2021...and does the OP genuinely believe that these bad faith posts aren&#039;t fully transparent to everyone on the forum?<br /><br />It is far more honest and honorable for the OP to simply say &quot;I believe that the open street should revert to how it was&quot; (Or whatever they believe)<br /><br />Than to attempt to unsuccessfully lead folks down some rabbit-hole.<br /><br />Maybe the future of online discussion is that folks will have learned not to argue...because it is pointless.<br />Much like we mostly know not to argue when we meet a random stranger on the street with a different opinion. (Unless we want to waste our time)<br /><br />The internet is pretty new...so I figure eventually folks will evolve concerning our interactions on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />I LOVE THE OPEN STREET of 34th Ave.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;As the OP, I&#039;ve changed my mind plenty. Often issues are presented on this forum and other sources of news and info that do help one sift through the morass. On the particular topic here of the 34th Ave Open Streets, I do feel that facts from the DOT are useless and the many forums and meetings have been mostly a waste of time. The lack of knowledge of the particulars of the were appalling by DOT staff and Jason and others who are paid to smooth things over but not solve anything that is a particular annoyance. Not sure who is responsible but that&#039;s another thread. If the proposed idea about closing Northern Blvd to regular vehicular traffic as proposed by another elected goes anywhere, I hope there is a public forum in which to comment on that.<br /><br />&nbsp;As for changes, I do see some areas where the Open Streets are good as in the morning when the many schools on 34th Ave are inundated with students and parents and it is a zoo, much worse in bad weather too. This opening IS good and helpful. But the thirteen hours!! Just no because it&#039;s not needed and not used. It just isn&#039;t no matter how much people want to say otherwise and cameras posted (which the DOT hasn&#039;t done yet) would detail high/low traffic.<br /><br />&nbsp;For the tired residents of 34th ave and nearby streets, it&#039;s too much. For those who live a few blocks away who think it&#039;s swell, I like to ask what if they closed off your street and dogs peed and pooed everywhere and it became a hazard for less mobile residents and oh god, the dreaded motorized bikes...and they say &quot;Oh my street couldn&#039;t close for this or that reason&quot; or people wouldn&#039;t like that street to be closed...and so on. You don&#039;t hear a loud level of complaining much because most of the people adversely affected are weary, working class residents who feel the time they would take out of their lives to say their thoughts would be a waste of their time. The heavily networked folks - yes, me and Obama like saying folks - are the super loud voices here. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; The little guys are being overlooked and even though some think this is not true and that these comments are obviously biased, I stand by them and do think there is value in repeating the issues. Courage to speak your values is something we could use more of and I personally like a thoughtful debate. FYI two other topics were hotly debated here over the years that did change and one was the use of our many private co-op gardens (which are never counted in the green space debate btw) being available to use for children. And also the segregation of our public schools in JH which is awful for the being touted as such a diverse area, but not now, finally, a mom from IS145 is actively opening that debate again. So change might be slow but it happens.<br />

				&nbsp;Let&#039;s put &quot;facts from the DOT&quot; in quotes. After all, they are the ones that recently put a bike rack in an bird crap covered underpass, have put loading zones in areas of the neighborhood with commercial lots already available (corner of 74th and Northern) and said things in meetings like we don&#039;t have any nearby bike lanes in Jackson Heights and we have a pretty great one on 31st Ave, just over from 34th.

These are their &quot;facts&quot; and that&#039;s why I am mystified by&nbsp; their &quot;facts&quot; because they are anything but true about the neighborhood.<br />&nbsp; Also what genius in the MTA who might be working with the DOT eliminated the bus stop in front of the physical therapy and radiation center and left the ones in front of Dunkin Donuts and the car wash on Northern Blvd?

				^Of course everyone doesn&#039;t agree about 34 OS. But the DoT having collected pedestrian counts at multiple times of days&nbsp; over the course of months which show high usage doesn&#039;t become less of a fact because you don&#039;t like where they placed a bike rack or a DoT employee misspoke about bike lanes in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Getting riled up over a program that the community has embraced - and let&#039;s remember the candidate for City Council who ran openly against 34 OS garnered all of a few hundred votes - really doesn&#039;t seem like a good use of anyone&#039;s energy. Better to advocate for changes to OS that will improve it to make it better (like a plan that eliminates the need for barricades to keep pedestrians protected and directs electric bikes and scooters being used for transportation purposes to streets with bike lanes).

Just, please don&#039;t expect me to celebrate with you, unless you&#039;re out there moving the barricades for me. Enjoy your open street while I grumble.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am curious, as well.<br /><br />If a person can&#039;t enjoy life and the small pleasures it offers...(like a great stroll down the Open Street of 34th Ave)...then when exactly does the enjoyment begin?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Granted a stroll can be enjoyed. In fact I enjoy strolling throughout the city, despite the lack of Open Streets elsewhere. But I grew up walking on sidewalks, and not jaywalking. I also enjoy driving, except driving in Jackson Heights during the Open Streets is like being in Midtown. But a stroll doesn&#039;t take long. Why does the street have to be closed for 13 hours so you can stroll on the street instead of on the sidewalk?

				&nbsp; Yes, OS is a mess. And advocating for change is a middle ground. Whose is in the middle? Not so many OS fans, is what I find sadly. Keep everything as is and in fact, give me more. Many of the 34th Ave residents are pleading for fewer hours, especially in the winter when they have to navigate the streets by foot, bikes, bus or vehicles and it&#039;s dangerous. But come hell or high water, others want the street closures untouched. Is this fair and/or advocating for change?<br /><br />&nbsp; For those residents on 34th ave, the outrageous closure time of not 4-6 or 8 hours but 13 HOURS of barricades to move and it&#039;s truly a hardship. Saw a man with a WW2 hat last week gingerly moving the metal barriers at 76th street last week to get to his garage and saying how frustrated he is with the city not listening to the residents about OS here. Add onto that it&#039;s MORE than 13 hours with trash pickup and street cleaning and these residents are fed up!! 6:15/6:30 garbage cans moving is insult to injury and very noisy!<br /><br />&nbsp; Voter turnout is so low here- I believe the last election was under 20%- that its a useless indicator of how the neighborhood feels about an issue, Open Streets or otherwise. Someone needs to do a fair and impartial assessment of the 34th OS and hopefully, it will not get litigious but it&#039;s certainly looking like it will go that way. <strong>The supporters of OS could compromise at any time...others are listening.</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				&nbsp;I believe the thinking for the big ask for all of 34th Ave to be closed imagined that the reality would be a smaller piece. The full stretch was designated as open streets and what many residents now see as overreach is a problem in the neighborhood for many. I do see more and more civil disobedience happening as residents take back the street. The 34th Ave corridor that the DOT meetings seemed to be pushing is a non-starter in Woodside and Corona along 34th no matter how much the cyclists want it. It&#039;s only JH that got stuck with 13hrs a day closures, 7 days a week far outpacing anything resembling Open Streets in all of NYC. Why just us?<br />&nbsp; Sorry for our restaurants too as the word is out that it&#039;s hellish getting here in vehicles now and as one poster said, it&#039;s like driving in midtown. Lots of honking, waiting for multiple lights to advance one block. I hope they can survive on only local patrons as that&#039;s a terrific part of being here in JH having some many great food choices.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				&nbsp; Some of the posters, like the previous one, sound to me like comrades of a party that limits freedom of speech. Pablum. And as Chickenring stated, there are many people whose anecdotal stories make up a larger number than most posters assume. As those dissenters get their day in court, the right sizing will happen. Isolating people like the 78th st folks who are not getting services because of the closures certainly have a case! Lawsuits are, sadly, the method that we use to get the point across when people are closed to listening to other points of view. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If people who like OS are so opposed to the barriers, why don&#039;t they try other solutions? There are many possibilities. And many residents would welcome a police/security presence on the ave, especially in the dark evenings when JH has traditionally had an uptick in crime. What&#039;s the delay here? And then what about the loss of a viable, several decades old bike lane on 34th Ave?Where is Transportation Alternatives when we need them? What is their plan for our seniors and less abled residents? It&#039;s truly unsafe to drive through people who might be walking the other way unaware there ever was a bike lane because it&#039;s unmarked. Many seniors are so afraid of anyone on e-bikes, they avoid the ave altogether or walk only in groups.<br />&nbsp; The dog pee and poo greenway that used to be the median is a festering problem and no one, repeat no one, should be gardening in there any longer. It&#039;s a petri dish of bacteria and has become a latrine of pet waste running down the avenue. It&#039;s hard to watch how irresponsible the OS has become in terms of the whole neighborhood but in the year of coming lawsuits, we&#039;ll see the outcome. Here&#039;s hoping both sides are finally heard and right sizing, right barriers? are on the way in 2022.<br /><br />

Where do you think the money for security would come from? Do you really want either additional man hours from the NYPD to cover 34th Avenue (which means an increase in budget) or resources diverted from other areas to provide more foot patrol hours on 34th Avenue? (And why? Nobody is screaming about increased crime along 34th Avenue).

				&nbsp;Sorry Captain, but it doesn&#039;t clear up a thing. Have been to many DOT meetings where they sit on their hands and at times, have implied they need to be fluid in response to the political headwinds on OS. Other OS look to be a seat of pants operation and it has been well documented in places where the neighborhoods push back and just move the barriers - or in at least one case- throw them in the Gowanus canal, their is community support. So no, there might be some official connections but DOT listen to higher powers and have been spineless with protection here. <br />&nbsp;What other OS can you point to that are comparable to 34th Ave and are successful? Most references are Vanderbilt Ave and if we moved OS to 37th Ave, our commercial avenue with amenities and that is in need of help, we might be on the same playing field. On 34th Ave., it&#039;s so bloated and problematic running through a residential area. In other areas, the OS have been cast aside by unhappy neighbors at a high rate and keeping this status without significant compromise seems delusional at best.

				^^Well, it should. You specifically asked:<br /><br /><strong>If <em>people who like OS</em> are so opposed to the barriers, why don&#039;t <em>they</em> try other solutions?</strong><br /><br />The answer is that the people who like OS don&#039;t have the authority to try other solutions. Or were up unclear of the grammar of your question?<br /><br />Turning to DoT, there&#039;s no mystery why that city agency has taken so long on this. There was an election in November for mayor. and city council. Undoubtedly, DoT decided to take it&#039;s sweet time to wait to see what the next mayoral administration and city council was going to be like. It also gave DoT time collect data on usage. They&#039;ve presented one possible solution - the diverters - and you&#039;re still here complaining about why there aren&#039;t other solutions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In other areas, the OS have been cast aside by unhappy neighbors at a high rate and keeping this status without significant compromise seems delusional at best.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />However, in this area there is high community support. One reason our OS is so successful is because of the well-managed, large, and committed group of volunteers willing to come out twice a day and move barricades. For almost a year and a half.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someday, it will become clear on this subject of rightsizing 34th ave OS, that there are people with legit different views. One side claims dominance now and says it has all sorts of support. Is this accurate? Has data collection been done to any extent and where has it been publicized? We need details on usage, like every chain restaurant and supermarket posts, for busy/slow hours. Then we can have a town hall style meeting with most affected parties at the table first. Rewind from the pandemic urgency to a more sophisticated plan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And then we might see something different happen with the physical situation. So far, just metal barriers, no diverters, no cones or anything that had been discussed at meetings. Heavy metal barriers, period. Tiny confusing signs also and many people still really do not know who runs the whole thing. Volunteers or the city? Both? Spell it out clearly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdoor dining is getting a case by case review which sounds great because some of the outdoor spaces are terrific and some are awful. Lots of other issues attached to outdoor dining. And we have lots of issues with OS and propose the same type of review for 34th Ave. Run the numbers, take the polls and knock on doors (no one we know has had anyone ask, ever in an official capacity about the impact of the closure). Look at footage from all hours of operations. Let&#039;s bring in professionals who know the whole city and can give an unbiased view of 34th Ave. See if it is the right JH street, first and then if it needs substantial alteration in length and timing. <br /><br />&nbsp; Needs a substantial review stat. Patient in distress.
