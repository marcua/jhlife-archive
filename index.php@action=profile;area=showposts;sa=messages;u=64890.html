					PLEASE RING 156 FOR THE OPEN HOUSE<br /><br />Located in The Manchester, one of the most desirable buildings in the heart of the Jackson Heights Historic District This two bedroom coop offers a beautiful blend between pre-war design and space. The appeal of the apartment extends to the neighborhood which offers tree-lined streets, a manicured garden and just around the corner from the annual weekly farmers market and Traver&#039;s Park which is undergoing a 3.6M renovation. This apartment boasts both a spacious layout with 1,100 sq ft, generously high ceilings and signature crown moldings, coupled with expansive large windows providing natural light throughout the day. When you enter the apartment there is a long hallway perfect for hanging your artwork, leading to a gorgeous entry foyer which can easily be used for a dining area. Another long hallway lined with four large closets leads to the master bedroom which is large enough to accommodate a California King. The kitchen has been updated with granite counter tops, a stoned back splash and stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher. The full sunken living room offers recessed lighting with three large windows and southern exposure. The second bedroom can accommodate a full size bed and is located just off of the living room. There is an art deco bathroom in pristine condition which has both a tub and a shower. <br /><br />The building boasts a gracious marble foyer, an immaculate laundry facility, garage, bike storage and has easy wheelchair access. There are plans to renovate the entry foyer as well as the hallways in the future. There is no date set as yet. The amenities of the building include: New beautiful roof deck garden with wide planked wood, patio furniture and stunning views of the Manhattan skyline. This building is pet-friendly and subleasing is allowed after one year of ownership. The unit comes with a parking space for $110 a month located in an indoor garage. There is storage available for $40 a month. There is a live in Super. Steps away from the bus that takes you to the 74th street, the E, F, M &amp; R train hub, and only a 5 block walk.<br /><br />The building has excellent financials and reserve fund. The monthly maintenance is $755.43 which includes taxes, heat and water. There is a minimum of 80% financing allowed. <br /><br />
