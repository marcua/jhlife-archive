				I don&#039;t know--it&#039;s strange, as the article says. But this is exactly what is described as happening in other places, notably Brooklyn. Another DOB violation scam--meaning, another way for them to impose fines and make money. Maybe I will ask the deli why they did that next time I stop in.

				DUH, you do need a permit to put a thousand pound metal structure above a doorway for OBVIOUS reasons. Double Duh, you need the city to tell you that you can not put up an awning across the sidewalk to the curb. If the owner of a buisness does not do due diligence before signing a lease, thatâ€™s his problem. I hope the city makes a mint in violations.<br />

				no problem with enforcement, as long as it&#039;s not selective. for starters, we need to have the city go in and demand demolition of all buildings that go over their legal height (more a manhattan thing, for now) or past their legal boundaries. none of these slap on the wrist fines.

				Itâ€™s not being&nbsp; selective. Itâ€™s whoâ€™s being reported.&nbsp; I will not ask the nationality of the buisness owner before reporting them. And we werenâ€™t talking about demolishing the top floors of buildings. That could be another topic if youâ€™d like.
