				While checking my yahoo mail, I happened to notice a few responses from one of the family groups I participate in regarding a post from Chowhound and how a French/American bistro would fare in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It seems that the original poster was trying to gauge the interest level of Jackson Heights residents because he/she/they may have a possible locale on 37th Avenue for such a restaurant.&nbsp; The Chowhound mods deleted the original post, but a new discussion has begun on the topic.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how long that one will last.&nbsp; So, on the hopes that this entrepreneur may be reading these forums, the question is:<br /><br />Would you welcome a French/American bistro in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />I vote yes.&nbsp; Although I absolutely love all the wonderful restaurants we have in our community, a French bistro would offer yet another option for those days when when one is in the mood for something different than what we already have in abundance in the Heights.

				It would definitely be a welcome addition to our nabe.&nbsp; Any alternative to our precious (though nutrition- and style-poor) local diners would be exciting.&nbsp; I can imagine it would be very popular.

				My vote: an enthusiastic &quot;yes&quot;.&nbsp; The glaring lack of variety among our restaurants and stores is one of the elephants in the living room.&nbsp; That now seems to be changing, albeit glacially.&nbsp; There is a pent-up demand for something more upscale here that finally seems to have come to the attention of entrepreneurs.<br />

				As long as there is brunch there as well, I think it&#039;s a brilliant idea :)

				I vote yes, yes, yes!!&nbsp; Although pastry/bread might draw a slightly different group, I think the enthusiasm for Cannelle indicates a appreciate from this community for French food.&nbsp; We need a few more places to buy high quality french cheeses too!&nbsp;

				It&#039;s a no go on the bistro. The guy who was thinking of doing it posted on another listserv -- he couldn&#039;t find a good spot open on 37th so he opened two places in Manhattan instead.

				Yep. He opened two places: one on Sullivan Street and a great pizzaria/Italian place called MOONPIE in the East Village.&nbsp; It would have been great had he been able to find something affordable here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how the 99 cent stores can open here with the high rents.

				I met the guy who was suppose to open up a French Bistro on 37th Ave. He was a really nice guy who was the owner and chef at Park Bistro,&nbsp; who for the francophiles among us know, was a three star French Bistro. They sold the building where he was located and after looking in JH, opened up 2 great places in the city.&nbsp; Moon Pie Pizzeria on Ave C and East 3rd and 169 Sullivan (a chic and&nbsp; romantic little American diner place at the same address). I work close by and had dinner at Sullivan Street one night and got to talking to the owner. His name is Rich and I subsequently took my family to the Pizza place.&nbsp; Both places may I add were incredibly good, family friendly and quite reasonable!!&nbsp; When I told him I lived in Jackson Heights,&nbsp; he gave my wife and myself&nbsp; a free glass of wine.&nbsp; He also said that he may still consider doing the Bistro thing in the future if an affordable place came up. He&#039;s a real Jackson Heights-o-phile who knew a lot about the hood and says he has a great garden party every year in his backyard with great food and wine!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed!!!!

				I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed as well. Although I thoroughly enjoy all the Latin restaurants in the area it would be fantastic to have a French Bistro in the neighborhood. I would be there at least twice a week!

				I&#039;ve also gone to Sullivan Street (American comfort food) and Moon Pie (great pizza etc.) restaurants in the City.&nbsp; Loved them both.&nbsp; I wanted Richie to open something here in the worst way.&nbsp; Park Bistro (French food) was fabulous.&nbsp; He would definitely add something different to the nabe with his sense of style in decorating and cooking.&nbsp; But it ain&#039;t happening yet... I haven&#039;t given up hope though and still occasionally bug him about doing something here.
