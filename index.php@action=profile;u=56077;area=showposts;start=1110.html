					Another option to consider is cabinet refacing. We had a consult with Home Depot. They&#039;ll install new doors with modern hinges (on the inside), sand down years of paint to add a laminate overlay to match the doors, add cabinetry if you want, replace a counter top, and it includes all hardware and a new faucet. The end result is a modern looking kitchen, in about three days. We&#039;re still trying to figure out if this is the route we want to go. It&#039;s not inexpensive, but I like the idea of sticking with our actual wooden cabinets, versus ripping out and replacing them with something of lesser quality.&nbsp; <br /><br />A word of advice though, if you want to go this route, wait until you&#039;ve done your research and have a good chunk of money saved. When the Home Depot designer does the consult, at that time he/she can offer you a lot - 10% discount, 24 month financing interest free. If you sign on the dotted line then and there, you can get those deals. (In NY state, you have 72 hours to change your mind).

					I lived there briefly a decade ago. The building was okay. I had issues with mice, and the super plugged up holes around my radiator with steel wool. The unit I occupied was a huge one bedroom, with an itty bitty kitchen and a small dining room that had been closed off from the kitchen (to make a possible second bedroom I think). There was no access to the interior courtyard as far as I knew, but there were with trees to look at if you had an interior apartment. Much nicer than some of the post-war buildings where you&#039;re looking at a lunar landscape of a parking garage. I wonder how much street noise you get facing 37th Avenue.<br /><br />I suspect rent has greatly increased since then. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" />

					The thing is, it&#039;s not like the boards list their requirements for a new shareholder. (I thought this was kind of silly, until someone pointed out to me it meant that the board can make an exception for whatever reason.) Had I known the first building we looked at wanted something like three years reserve *after* closing, I&#039;d have never wasted my time and money. A good agent can give you loads of info that&#039;s actually not publicly available. We had insight in to which buildings&#039; financials were a mess, and which ones were in really good shape. Our agent was really plugged in. But you know if she hadn&#039;t sold in to a small coop, like an Elm Court for example, what are you going to do? Take a leap I guess.<br /><br />Another good source of info is MLSLI.com. If you just look at what has been sold, you can see the difference between what was asked, and what the sale price was (you&#039;ll have to do some clicking). Pretty much every one bedroom that was on the market in Jackson Heights last spring sold for less than asking. When I compared that to Sunnyside, where there are far fewer coops, I could see that pretty much everything there on the market in the last year had sold for more than asking.

					We recently bought an apartment in need of renovation work, but by golly our cabinets - original from the 1955 build - are solidly built and really good quality. (Sure, there&#039;s contact paper in them, but its clean and we only see it when we open the cabinets) So, we decided there was no reason at this time to replace them, and would rather save up to buy equally solid, high quality cabinets that will bring our kitchen in to the 21st century. <br /><br />We&#039;re also looking at repainting and replacing some of he hardware. I think you might be a little luckier than we are. Our bottom cabinets have a big corner in them that if I were buying new ones today I&#039;d look at putting in a big lazy susan in that location. Now, we have to use that space to store the things we don&#039;t use that often, and then curse when we actually have to retrieve it. I swear, when I cleaned the kitchen before unpacking our things, I practically had to climb in to wipe down to the corner.

					I think this is a difficult market if you&#039;re looking at 2 and 3 bedrooms. Far less difficult if you&#039;re looking at one-bedrooms. Some of the apartments we looked at back in the summer are still on the market. The unit we ended up buying had been on the market for eight months -- probably because it was overpriced. We must have hit the sweet spot timing wise, where the seller was now seeing the extra maintenance payments adding up, and considering if it was really worth sticking to a price no one was biting at.

					we were told the board wanted new shareholders to have a really high reserve after closing. I can&#039;t recall if it was a year or two years. That&#039;s *a lot* of money. The brick is going to have to be repointed (is that what it&#039;s called?) in a couple of years, and at the time we were apartment hunting there was the potential for a roof issue. We wondered if the high reserve required after closing was to be sure shareholders could pay for large future assessments. The building&#039;s mortgage since we were looking has come due, so they&#039;ve likely refinanced since then.<br /><br />74th Street by 34th Avenue is pretty quiet. The building seemed to be in a good shape, but we never got access to a boiler room (the super out and out refused to cooperate, and apparently the management company was cool with that).

					Roosevelt Terrace doesn&#039;t own their land, but it has the right to renew the lease under the same terms, once the lease is up (original lease was for 99 years). So, I don&#039;t think a land lease is necessarily a worrisome thing, if the terms were thought out with what happens at the end of the lease?

					There&#039;s also smaller one bedrooms on the market right now with maintenance fees of less than $500. If I had been single when I bought, I very likely would have gone for a slightly smaller apartment than the one I bought with my spouse (as long as it was pet friendly:) )

					A couple of things to note. The census measures median *household* income. The median figure is where half of what&#039;s being being measured falls below the median, and the other 50 percent follows above. So, this doesn&#039;t mean that the average income in Jackson Heights is $50K, it means that 50% of all households - which includes single people, couples, and couples with kids - makes more than 50K and 50% makes less.<br /><br />A two income household making $75K a year isn&#039;t rich. Add a couple of kids, and they&#039;re even less rich.

					I don&#039;t quite recall the specifics of a buyer&#039;s agent. Do you sign a contract guaranteeing you will use the agent exclusively, and pay a fee?<br /><br />If that&#039;s the case, we didn&#039;t do that. But we did work with an agent. We actually worked with two. The first one showed us a couple of listing, one which we made an offer on. After reviewing the financials, we had some questions and never heard back from the seller&#039;s agent. After that, the agent we had been using had some stuff come up that meant she couldn&#039;t show us any apartments for awhile, and referred us to another agent.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you the difference was night and day. Our second agent told us the reserve that the building we made an offer on required was well beyond what we had saved up. So, our money was completely wasted by having our attorney review the board minutes and building financials since the board would never have approved us anyway. She knew a lot about the different buildings: which financials were a mess, which required a huge reserve in savings after closing, which had what income requirements, and which ones financial requirements were inline with our financial picture. A knowledgeable agent can steer you to the buildings -- and boards -- that are a good fit for you. Our agent negotiated on our behalf on the apartment we eventually bought. We felt the seller was asking too much for the condition of the apartment, and our agent agreed. We were very happy with her. Anyone wanting a referral can email me.

					We have a bronze finish (crackle) metal chandelier with three glass shades we&#039;re looking to sell. The light fixture is in excellent condition (see pictures). If our ceilings were a bit higher, or we were a bit shorter, we probably would have kept it in our apartment.<br /><br />Asking $50, or best offer. Please email.

					Hello! I&#039;m a newbie to the forum, though I have been lurking since we decided to apartment hunt in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m looking forward to participating in this community.<br /><br />We are buying an apartment in need of a new floor. We have to remove a well-worn carpet, and install wood floors (Bamboo, Hardwood, or Engineered) on top of a new subfloor to cover up some old vinyl tiles, before moving in.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend vendors to speak to? <br /><br />Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;
