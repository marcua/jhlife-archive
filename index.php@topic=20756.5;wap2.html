			<br />--- Quote from: toddg on November 09, 2021, 07:30:03 PM ---At this point in time, it feels that there are more options than ever for discussing community issues online, and that the time for a site like this has largely faded.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />This site will be sorely missed.&nbsp; If anyone could post these other options, I&#039;m sure many would appreciate it.&nbsp; I tend to avoid most social media outlets because of their toxicity, and appreciated the mostly civil discourse the moderators encouraged.<br /><br />Good luck in your future endeavors.

			I loved this site and found many useful suggestions over the years. Many similar sites have&nbsp; already shut down because the volume on these type of sites has significantly declined.&nbsp; Although I would open the web page often I found less and less good reads.&nbsp; Also when the amount of posters dwindled the same posters would dominate the discussions and post multiple similar opinions on the same threads to get in their last word making some threads unreadable.<br /><br /><br />I&nbsp; want to express my gratitude to all those that made it happen.&nbsp; It was fun while it lasted.

			I guess people are using Next Door? This was a very useful site, but I did notice that there were very few active posters on it. There is also the JHFamilies listserv, which is quite active and useful for selling, donating, buying stuff, asking questions about vendors, or general neighborhood discussion. Thanks to the folks who created this site and ran it!
