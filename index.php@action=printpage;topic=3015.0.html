				<strong><em>If you are concerned about</em>:<br />- Walking across Roosevelt Ave safely<br />- Traffic Congestion on 37th Avenue and side streets<br />- Noise from idling trucks<br />- Speeding cars on residential streets<br />- Slow buses<br />- Pollution from trucks and airplanes<br />- Horn honking !!!<br />- and many other transportation-related concerns<br /><br />You can do something about it.<br /></strong><br />I wanted everyone to know about a very important community workshop<br />coming up that will have a huge impact on transportation in Jackson Heights .<br />The Dept of Transportation is beginning a major $1.5 million study of<br />transportation in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The first phase of the study will focus on the area of east-west<br />(69th Street-82nd Street) and north-south (Northern Blvd- Broadway).<br />A key focus of the study is to improve pedestrian access<br />to the mass transit hub at 74th/Roosevelt.<br />The study will include the implementation of short-term and long-term<br />transportation solutions.<br /><br />The first Community Workshop for the study will be held on Thursday,<br />July 16th at 6:30pm at the White Castle Headquarters 69-01 34th Avenue<br />in Jackson Heights. Please attend. I think it is critical that we have the local<br />community participate in the discussion.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Mark your calendars</span>:<br /><strong>Thursday, July 16th 6:30pm</strong><br />Jackson Heights Neighborhood Transportation Study<br />Community Workshop<br />White Castle Headquarters<br /><strong>69-01 34th Avenue</strong>, Jackson Heights<br /><br />I hope to see you there.

				It would be nice if DOT could devote some of their Urban Art Program budget to some projects in Jackson Heights but it might require a JH sponsoring organization.<br /><br />Here is a DOT project that was made in DUMBO.<br />(http://www.psfk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dumbo_streetart_1.jpg)<br />You can read more about that one in this article &nbsp;DOT curates street art &nbsp;(http://www.psfk.com/2008/03/nyc-dept-of-transportation-curates-street-art.html)<br /><br /><strong>About the Urban Art Program</strong><br />The Urban Art Program is an initiative to invigorate the City&#039;s streetscapes with engaging temporary art installations. As part of the World Class Streets initiative, art will help foster more vibrant and attractive streets and offer the public new ways to experience New York Cityâ€™s streetscapes.<br /><br />DOT will partner with community-based organizations to install temporary murals, sculpture, and other installations in plazas, and on medians, triangles, sidewalks, jersey barriers and construction fences. DOT will also work with organizations/artists on temporary art projections and lighting projects in plazas and on appropriate bridges (masonry on sides of bridges), viaducts, and archways, as well as performance art and musical and theatrical performances in plazas and DOT ferry terminals.<br /><br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/sidewalks/urbanart_prgm.shtml

				A second neighborhood workshop should be coming up soon (there was one scheduled for the end of February, but it was cancelled due to the snow).<br /><br />But meanwhile, the city gave a presentation to an advisory group hosted by the Community Board.&nbsp; Here is the Power Point presentation from that meeting (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/jacksonheights_cac_020910_presentation.pdf).<br />

				Because of such noise and unnecessary loitering causing pain,&nbsp; I was told to get a hearing test at the NY Eye and Ear Infirmary.&nbsp; I might be slightly hearing difficient on one side.&nbsp; And I hardly listen to music and if at all at the lowest level.&nbsp; I have to call 212-979-4340 to set an appt.&nbsp; Hope all is fine.<br /><br />There should be traffic police for a while who also direct public out away from the streets so cars can keep on moving.&nbsp; There should be a limit to the loitering outside residential buildings.&nbsp; I was shocked to see a couple eating food inside out lobby.&nbsp; I asked them if they lived here, apparently not.&nbsp; May be we should also have translated signs saying no loitering.&nbsp; Just walking out of the subway is so difficult for more than a block and half.&nbsp; The men dont move.&nbsp; They dont understand what excuse me means.&nbsp; Instead he yelled at me saying Squeeze ME! Squeeze Me!&nbsp; Our Neighborhood was never this inconsiderate before.&nbsp; I just see men chatting away without realizing people need to pass through. Their driving is horrible too.&nbsp; I dont think they unstand what DOnt honking means.&nbsp; I think it should be said it different languages, so they should understand. Ive seen so many signs near Duane Reade and cars simoky ignoring it.&nbsp; I hate it especially when they honk in your face.&nbsp; Thats them abusing my ears.&nbsp; I think ill go deaf soon.<br /><br />For the old Jackson Heighters who have lived during the quiet days of our streets, we must so sometime.&nbsp; we simply must.<br /><br /><br />PS Besides perhaps going deaf, i didnt have my reading glasses while typing.&nbsp; Pardon me on my typos and errors.<br /><br />

				I have noticed planes landing at LGA - is Jackson Heights on a flight path for the southern runway? If so, is there a pattern - it doesn&#039;t seem to happen everyday but it is not &quot;maintenance&quot; or &quot;construction&quot; related.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s the weather.&nbsp; We&#039;re new to the neighborhood and concerned about noise from planes as well as the incessant honking?&nbsp; Will I ever get used to it?&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated.

				The April 17th workshop had quite a turnout: over 120 people participated!<br /><br />All of the boards and presentation materials showing the city&#039;s work documenting and analyzing transportation issues in the neighborhood can be found at the project website (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/jacksonheights.shtml).<br /><br />They&#039;ve put a lot of work into this, so it&#039;s worth a look.<br /><br />The main thrust of the last meeting was to discuss with the community the concept that different streets serve different purposes, and that the street network can better meet the community&#039;s diverse needs if different regulations and design criteria were used on streets that perform different functions. &nbsp;They circulated a Street Classification Workbook (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/jacksonhts_classification_workbook.pdf) and encouraged participants to provide feedback on the specific block where they live. &nbsp;<br /><br />The next step is a pair of workshops that are being held on April 27th and April 29th. &nbsp;There&#039;s no need to attend both... they&#039;ve scheduled two times so make it convenient for as many people as possible to participate.<br /><br />Street Classification Workshop<br />Tuesday, April 27th or Thursday, April 29th, 2010 (same material will be presented at both)<br />P.S. 69<br />77-02 37th Avenue<br />(Between 77th and 78th Streets)<br />Jackson Heights, Queens<br /><br />As a transportation planner myself, I&#039;m really quite impressed with this effort. &nbsp;NYCDOT has committed a tremendous amount of time and effort toward gathering community input in this process. &nbsp;The issues are complex, so they have developed some innovative strategies for providing information to the community, and gathering its responses. &nbsp;We&#039;re fortunate that Jackson Heights was chosen for this experiment. <br /><br />Now we have an opportunity. &nbsp;It&#039;s clear that NYCDOT is looking for bold outcomes these days (e.g. 1 (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/nyregion/24union.html) 2 (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html) 3 (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/nyregion/23street.html)). &nbsp;So if we as a community can articulate some bold ideas or community needs, there&#039;s a good chance NYCDOT will help us to bring them to reality. &nbsp;This is a process that&#039;s well worth engaging.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the flyer for the upcoming meeting...<br /><br />(http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4549296879_2836908a1b_o.jpg)

				Geez. The visualization of the number of crashes involving pedestrians around the 74th Street/Roosevelt Ave. subway stop is sobering. Our neighborhood has been on the receiving end of some crappy urban planning. I&#039;m glad that the traffic side of things is being addressed.

				I see that one of the editors of Streetfilms lives in the neighborhood, and has featured some &#039;natural&#039; traffic calming at intersections. (and relating it to the traffic cones that school crossing guards have been putting down to slow turning cars down at crosswalks). <br />Something to think about with the upcoming presentation: http://www.streetfilms.org/snowy-neckdowns-redux-winter-traffic-calming/ (http://www.streetfilms.org/snowy-neckdowns-redux-winter-traffic-calming/)

				I was there for part of it and was very impressed with how well they identified specific density and traffic congestion problems and the solutions they suggested. &nbsp;They said they would be putting up all the details of the various study results and proposed changes on their website this weekend. &nbsp;(There are a lot, many simple and/or relatively small so I can&#039;t do it all justice here) &nbsp;<br /><br />What they proposed, especially all combined seemed like it would make a VAST improvement for the community as a whole, in many ways, and for all parties, with minimal disruption. &nbsp; I have to say I appreciate that these problems are in the hands of these professionals as they seem quite ready and able to solve them for the broadest benefit to the neighborhood. &nbsp;I hope that others in the community recognize the positive opportunities and potential here and get behind it so all of the changes go through. &nbsp;<br /><br />Kudos to the DOT. &nbsp;This was a good use of money for sure, in my opinion anyway. &nbsp;:)<br />

				I attended the afternoon meeting and made the comment that it might be practicable if the section of 75th Street between 37th Avenue and Roosevelt was made one way south, in conformity with the major proposal of 75th becoming the new south bus route - rather than 73rd.<br /><br />This offers two advantages:<br /><br />1. It avoids cars dead-ending at 37th Avenue as they arrive at what is proposed as a&nbsp; &quot;new&quot; south bound 75th street. Avoiding that left-right decision and pedestrian crossing delays.<br />2. It provides a route around the 75th street parking lot which all too frequently clogs 75th street and eventually 37th Ave as cars cue awaiting an opening in the lot.<br /><br />The challenge is getting the passengers off the bus at 37th Avenue. The current proposal is that&nbsp; htye dpart on the south-west corner of 75th and 37th. But passengers depart on the right of the road and the buss would be traveling in the left lane of the 2 land separated road. Possible solutions: <br /><br />1. Passengers could depart by Armondo&#039;s, before the bus crosses 37th Ave.<br />2. Do not have a stop at 37th Ave. Next stop = Roosevelt.<br />3. Reconfigure Elmjack &quot;park&quot; with crossover after the park.<br /><br />But I would like to hear the history behind the current street configuration before going too far on this. Why so many south bound streets? Perhaps we&#039;re overlooking something outside the study area.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br />75th Street

				We haven&#039;t had much discussion of the city&#039;s proposed changes to our neighborhood streets.&nbsp; The changes are significant, and in my opinion a big step forward for pedestrian safety, traffic flow, and quality of life in our community.&nbsp; But these plans can always benefit from more community discussion and feedback.<br /><br />The city&#039;s recommendations for improvements in the neighborhood are here (http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/recommendations-2/).<br />A summary of the feedback provided by the community at the Feb. 12th meeting is here (http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/files/2011/03/Jackson-Heights-Feb-12-Meeting-Comments.pdf).<br /><br />What do you think?<br />

				I shouldn&#039;t care now that I live in Astoria, where parking is dreamy. But one of the reasons I moved away from JH is the traffic situation. Not only parking, but mainly the behavior of the drivers - like honking at cars in front on the queue RIGHT as the light turns green. Or watching someone try to parallel park their SUV by hitting the cars in the front and back of the spot repeatedly, in order to make room.<br /><br />A lot people seemed to hate on bike lanes. But how else will you get your food delivered if your delivery guy gets hit?! I own a car, not a bicycle, but I am so pro-bike lines. &quot; Bicycles are a hindrance to drivers&quot; and drivers are a hindrance to pedestrians, what&#039;s this person&#039;s point?<br /><br />&quot;People currently donâ€™t know where they can and canâ€™t park â€“ a low-tech solution might involve using yellow paint to designate illegal spots to help motorists. &quot; This makes way too much sense.<br /><br />&quot;37th Avenue with 73rd and 74th Streets â€“ Donâ€™t Block the Box&quot; Also, this makes too much sense.<br /><br />&quot;Most of the AM parkers currently are outsiders who use the spots all day.&quot; If Jackson Heights hates anythings, it&#039;s OUTSIDERS!!!<br /><br />Wish they would just do a study on why drivers are jerks and don&#039;t know that pedestrians have the right of way and it&#039;s a d___ move to honk at old people who cross the street too slowly. Like these people are so important and always running late that they have to scare the bejesus out of everyone outside their car.<br /><br />What&#039;s with all the double parking on 35th Ave? People don&#039;t even pull all the way over, so you have cross into the on-coming traffic lane when trying to pass them.

				I agree that congestion pricing would have been great for the city.&nbsp; <br /><br />But here&#039;s one thing to keep in mind: congestion pricing was <span class="bbc_u">not</span> about penalizing drivers.&nbsp; It would have encouraged a small percentage of discretionary drivers to use alternatives, dramatically reduced congestion on our city&#039;s streets and highways, raised revenue for the first significant expansion of transit services in a generation, and relieved taxpayers of the burden of maintaining the city&#039;s bridges.&nbsp; Aside from the parking lot lobby and the Queens Chamber of Commerce, nearly every civic, environmental, social justice, business, and labor group in the city and all three of the city&#039;s major newspapers supported the proposal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now the tabloids are selling a lot of papers trying to spin the city&#039;s latest proposals as anti-car, but these proposals would benefit drivers and non-drivers alike.&nbsp; The city&#039;s current ideas for Jackson Heights will alleviate chronic traffic congestion on 73rd Street, reduce the number of cars double-parking on 37th Avenue, speed bus riders&#039; trips to the terminal, help pedestrians cross Roosevelt Avenue more safely, and provide the neighborhood with a great new public square.&nbsp; Some people hate change, and inevitably there will be distraught headlines, stories about the city declaring war on one group or another, and predictions of chaos when the city begins to implement these recommendations.&nbsp; But the DOT has developed a balanced proposal based on extensive community input that improves our neighborhood streets for everybody.&nbsp; The more we can do now to learn about the proposals, provide constructive feedback, and let our elected officials know we support the city&#039;s plans, the greater chance we&#039;ll see them implemented successfully.<br />

				It is so important for residents to get involved, and to watch out for changes that favor vehicles over pedestrians.<br /><br />Nearly ten years ago DOT wanted to make 37th Ave go one way in one direction, and Roosevelt one way in the opposite direction. They claimed it would increase vehicular traffic speed. Quite so, JH would have become a rat run for BQE-to-Grand Expressway traffic, and we would have had highspeed car racetracks running through the heart of our community to rival Manhattan boulevards. Frighteningly (for me), there were only about 50 local residents at the consultation meeting where this was proposed; but, thankfully, we all made our feelings so strongly vocal that they gave up on the idea. Phew!<br /><br />I am glad these proposals do consider pedestrians and bicycles.

				About a couple of years ago they were going to vote on making 74th St one way(northbound)from<br />Queens Blvd to Woodside Ave, nothing came of it. I figured it was somebody with some influence<br />who made them scrap the plan.<br /><br />They made 43rd Ave one way from 76th St to 69th St, but left 44th Ave the same(a 2 way street).<br />Why are 72nd and 74th Sts the only 2 way streets between 45th Ave/Queens Blvd and Broadway.<br />All the others from 76th St to 82nd St are one way.<br />Exclude 75th St because that street has the median in the middle.<br /><br />

				If you haven&#039;t seen the notices already, on Thursday morning 8/25 the traffic direction will change on 75th street. Begining Thursday the traffic will be southbound (rather than northbound right now) from 25th Avenue up to 37th Avenue. The rest will remain as is.<br /><br />I just want to remind everyone to be careful in the first couple of weeks. There&#039;s always someone who didn&#039;t realise the change.

				&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Passing along a message-<br />&nbsp;Residents of 75th street in Jackson Heights are hoppin mad at the recent street changes. Many of these homeowners are not on this<br />or other local sites and apparently did not see/hear of the proposed changes till shortly before they happened. Many of these residents<br />are not native English speakers and think they should have been contacted on a door-to-door basis for something as big as this. Those<br />homes are not the sturdiest and the steep pitch of the driveways (which flood basements often) are of concern for these homeowners<br />now with increased traffic. Danny Dromm is now persona non grata on 75th street. I suggest he or his assistants visit there very soon and talk on an individual basis and assure them this was thought out.<br />&nbsp;And that going forward with changes that appear to go by consensus, we not rely on internet communication in a neighborhood that has so much diversity and so many members not online which makes communication just in English, and just online, an inaccurate method of working out neighborhood issues. <br />&nbsp;More personal contact in gathering data, please.

				This morning, after watching the intersection of 75th &amp; 37th for a while and observing that all seemed to be working fine, I started composing in my head a message for this forum congratulating the neighborhood for allowing something good to happen without a lot of overwrought drama. &nbsp;I never posted it, and now it looks like I missed my window of opportunity.<br /><br />I think this change was clearly a home run for the neighborhood. &nbsp; It will significantly benefit drivers, pedestrians, and neighbors alike who have suffered for years from the congestion on 73rd and 76th Streets. &nbsp;And it will improve the commutes of riders on the Q49 bus (I&#039;m not so sure about the Q47, but that&#039;s another story). &nbsp;Mayor Bloomberg is to be commended for the continuing creativity and responsiveness of his Department of Transportation. &nbsp;The Jackson Heights Neighborhood Transportation Study included a community involvement process that was unprecedented for our city, and would have been impressive even for a much smaller town. &nbsp;The recommendation to reverse 75th Street came out of years of neighborhood advocacy.<br /><br />I have no doubt that some people are hopping mad about the change. &nbsp;How could it be otherwise in a neighborhood as large and diverse as ours? &nbsp;But the idea that Danny Dromm is political trouble about this is silly. &nbsp;Far more people, myself included, are grateful to him for his forward-looking stance on community livability and safety issues.<br /><br />And anyway, what is the complaint here? &nbsp;That the city recklessly and maliciously <em>changed the view</em> from their parked cars without sufficient prior notice? &nbsp;If somebody has a real complaint, encourage them come here and tell the community what it is. &nbsp;We welcome posts in other languages, so that should not be an obstacle.

				I think that 75th Street is running great.<br /><br />There were community meetings for 2 years, most of them at PS69, and well publicized in English and Spanish.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there seemed to be a lack of interest, as the meetings were attended well, but I think more people should have came.<br /><br />Since they were informed, and it seems that these residents were not interested, I cannot see reasoning why they should complain.<br /><br />The information was posted all over and weeks prior to the reversal was streamed in huge signage boards on 75th Street.<br /><br />Not to be blunt, but this is the truth, how can people complain if they were not interested in attending the planning meetings.

				The changes are fantastic for me! Very welcome. But I don&#039;t live on 75th street. I look for notices about important local events<br />and participate when I can in alot of local issues. But many of my neighbors don&#039;t. A surprising number of adults don&#039;t read written materials and I think this is a the heart of the problem. These residents feel that the situation &quot;was rammed down their throats with two<br />weeks notice.&quot; Besides many residents not speaking English as a first language, many of these homeowners have small businesses,<br />work at the hospital, have crazy busy schedules and keep to themselves. <br />&nbsp;I personally saw the notices for the meetings. But someone responsible for notifying people from a governmental office, should&#039;ve made sure, in person - going house by house if necessary- that those most affected, were notified well in advance. This didn&#039;t happen apparently. And the expectation that this is a neighborhood where everyone can read announcement online or posted in public places doesn&#039;t compute with the reality of the situation we have here. Someone should&#039;ve noticed that the people whose homes were going to be most changed were not present! at the meetings. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And they are not happy. Increased traffic, particularly bus and school bus traffic, has been the subject here on this site of people moving homes altogether because of the nuisance. Many of these residents have been decades in their homes. It may seem like a simple change of direction to some but they are concerned about the lack of interest in their voice regarding this decision. Also, the physical situation of some of the homes comes into play. There are homes with a steep pitch in their driveways that invites flooding into the lower parts or the foundation of the homes making the foundations less than stable. Add increased traffic and you could really imagine a problem. Danny Dromm( whom I think is terrific) is the name that has been associated with the change. I don&#039;t even know if this is true but it&#039;s what these residents think about who in government may be responsible. Can someone go visit these homes and spend some face time with these homeowners? And let&#039;s not rely on notices online or posted when a more personal touch could be implemented, even with volunteers.<br />It shouldn&#039;t be 73rd street wins and 75th street loses which is how they seem to feel now.

				It&#039;s preposterous to me that people who have lived in the area for &quot;decades&quot; have their heads so far buried in the sand that they don&#039;t have a clue about what&#039;s going on in their community. If they were truly invested they would be aware, connected to community resources and deal with their part of the neighborhood like every other part of this city. There are enough opportunities on-line and off to learn about what&#039;s going on. From the local community board to civic associations, public meetings, newspapers, email blasts, web sites and all around chatter that a personal invite to a community wide forum should not be necessary. It says more about people who suddenly figure out how to be involved when something affects them personally than it does about those who do the outreach. Personally, I don&#039;t want my tax dollars spent paying someone to knock on doors&nbsp; trying to track down each and every living soul when they can be working on more important issues. Nothing about this change was done in secret, in fact quite the opposite. If people chose to be disconnected form their community then that&#039;s their problem. <br /><br />For the record I received mail about the proposed issues from an elected official. Yes, USPS delivers Snail Mail from a State representative informing me and presumably those in my area of public meetings where the proposed changes were to be discussed.&nbsp; Based on that mailing and where I live, I assume the overwhelming majority of people affected by this change received the same information. There was ample and accessible opportunity for everyone in our area to participate in the discussions about the change to 75th Street long before it ever happened. <br /><br />There will always be someone who isn&#039;t happy with something, it&#039;s part of living in a community and understanding that the needs of the whole outweigh the needs of the few. We all have to compromise.

				I sympathize with the 75th Streeters. You really had to be looking to notice the signs regarding the community transportation meetings. Because I&#039;m interested, friends with someone loosely connected with the process, and online, I noticed and attended and participated. Through reading this forum, I knew about the scheduled traffic direction change weeks before any of the non-JHLifers on 75th St. would have found out, if indeed no one notified them in particular. Come on, folks, they didn&#039;t even get a letter from the DoT? <br /><br />And now I am living with the unintended consequences of the traffic flow change. I&#039;m on 77th Street, and all the traffic that used to go up 75th St. turns up 77th St. instead. Where else are they going to go-- 74th Street? The traffic itself would not be so bad if it weren&#039;t for the fact that the drivers are impatient and honk their horns when they are backed up down the street, as if the one-minute-28-second red light at 35th Ave is broken, and then they honk when it turns green because they fail to understand the physics of the car in front having to move before the next car does, etc, and they&#039;re 8 or 10 cars back. The honking gets so bad on weekend afternoons that I&#039;m considering investing in eggs so I can throw them from my window. If that&#039;s what the 75th Streeters want back, well, I say bless them-- give them back their north-bound traffic and give me back my relative peace.

				Oy, Maple, I feel for you. That has happened for years on 73rd Street.<br /><br />The actual solution to all of this will never happen: we need to solve the problem of too many people driving in from the suburbs to shop and socialize in a small area not designed for heavy automobile traffic. (I&#039;m talking 35th Avenue to Roosevelt, 72nd to 76th specifically.) The answer would be some hero building a gigantic multi-story parking lot, preferably right next to the BQE at 37th, and maybe another one on Northern. Replace one of the sprawling CVS/Walgreens on Northern, for instance.<br /><br />Anyway, that just isn&#039;t going to happen.

				I definitely sympathize, as these are the same complaints that 73rd St residents have been making for years now. &nbsp;DOT finally rerouted the buses off 73rd because on a weekend, the traffic on 73rd is backed up to 34th Ave and those buses would almost never arrive in a timely manner. &nbsp;Plus, all of the double-parking and other shenanigans on 73rd make the street almost impassable for large vehicles, leading the bus drivers to lay on the horns. &nbsp;73rd St is now noticeably quieter and less congested (although certainly still crazy at peak times!).<br /><br />If you look at the 73rd St threads, you will see a number of comments along the lines of &quot;you live in a busy area, just suck it up&quot; (or worse, posters impugning the motives of those with complaints). &nbsp;That is completely unfair for 73rd St, and certainly for these other streets that are now sharing part of the traffic burden.<br /><br />I thought the meetings were very well advertised through mailings and postings, and I&#039;m only somewhat engaged in community matters because of family and job duties.<br /><br />What do folks propose doing now that 73rd St is not bearing the entire brunt of the buses, honking, and congestion?<br /><br />My opinion is that the only solutions are long-term and involve reducing car usage in the neighborhood. &nbsp;As pointed out above, congestion pricing would immediately change the economic calculation for owning a car and driving to Manhattan. &nbsp;Some people need them, and I&#039;d been fine with a waiver or credit for small businesses. &nbsp;However, I know a number of people in JH with a suburban mindset that drive simply because they are lazy or think public transit is for other people.<br /><br />Another set of changes would be converting &quot;free&quot; (actually taxpayer-subsidized) parking into metered spots, and raising the meter rates. &nbsp;That would reduce traffic from outside the neighborhood and cut down on the number of cars just circling around looking for parking. &nbsp;Other cities have successfully tried systems that change the rate based on the time of day or amount of available parking...<br /><br />I&#039;m afraid that traffic will only get worse for additional blocks soon when 37th Road closes. &nbsp;Again, the reason is to reduce the incredible burden on 73rd St and its intersections / cross-streets. &nbsp;Once DOT has made these changes (after several years of studies and open comment periods), it is unlikely they will revert to the old traffic pattern any time soon. &nbsp;Long-term changes are necessary.

				That&#039;s funny, Peromyscus. Your answer to the congestion issue is public policy changes. Mine is a multistory parking lot. Not sure what that says about us, but it&#039;s an interesting contrast.<br /><br />(revised, because I thought again) I think the issue in that particular area - tell me if you disagree - isn&#039;t resident car use or commuters, but massive nonresident shopping/dining traffic, with a lot of the visitors coming from places like Richmond Hill and Long Island where taking transit in isn&#039;t an option. Making it difficult to park would just reduce business. We need to find a way to let those visitors park without congesting the residential streets.

				Hey planesland, yeah that is kind of funny and I guess kind of a big government vs. free market contrast! &nbsp;I wouldn&#039;t be against a parking garage, but I think there would have to be serious negative incentives (i.e. a high cost of looking for street parking) for it to work. &nbsp;There is a pay lot on 75th that is rarely at capacity (I know because I often tell driving guests to try there if they don&#039;t find street parking right away), but you still have tons of people circling. &nbsp;How would you encourage or force people to use a garage? &nbsp;But yeah, you&#039;re right...none of this is going to happen!<br /><br />(MODIFIED to in response to planesland above): yes, that is a good point and agreed that a lot of the nonresident traffic are driving to buy large amounts of groceries (i.e. not practical for public transportation)...don&#039;t want to hurt the businesses too much.&nbsp; But there simply isn&#039;t ever going to be enough parking on those few streets to satisfy demand (it&#039;s already really difficult to park)...raising the price of meters would allow those willing to pay to park right next to the shopping, and then others can use a garage or lot (assuming they can be built).&nbsp; If the street parking is too cheap or free, then I think people will be too enticed to circle around and then end up double-parking when they finally give up!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=6593.msg41221#msg41221">Quote from: theplanesland on September 13, 2011, 08:49:42 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That&#039;s funny, Peromyscus.

				I live on 75th and was aware of the changes being made only through this forum.&nbsp; I did not receive a mailing nor did I see a flyer posted in my building&#039;s lobby, which is how we communicate throughout the building normally.&nbsp; I have no one to blame but myself for not showing up to the last meeting.&nbsp; I was away for that meeting and forgot about the one or two others (?) that were scheduled.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for noise, I was expecting a lot of honking, but that hasn&#039;t materialized.&nbsp; Ironically, my friend who lives on 76th St says she now hears honking all the time, and her apt faces the garden, not the street!&nbsp; My theory is that with the buses coming through every 3 minutes down our block, people are getting wise and choosing to drive south down her street in lieu of ours.&nbsp; So the folks on 76th St seem to be suffering as well.&nbsp; I say suffer because we on 75th St definitely suffer from the high pitched squealing of the bus brakes as they slow down and stop for the red light.&nbsp; <br /><br />I timed the buses one evening and they run every 3 minutes sometimes, more like every 5 minutes other times.&nbsp; The bus schedule has to be wrong because they are running more often in the evening than it would appear on paper.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also observed that some of these buses are &quot;Out of Service&quot; and have no passengers in them.&nbsp; That really grates at me because they add to the noise without any benefit to commuters.&nbsp; I will definitely be calling 311, although I am honestly resigned to this situation until we move out of here.&nbsp; Not being on a bus route was one of the reasons for why I bought my apt 9 years ago.&nbsp; I wonder how many other people will be moving with me.

				<strong>Lots of changes coming the week of Sept. 19th!</strong><br /><br />The next round of improvements from the Jackson Heights Neighborhood Transportation study will include conversion of one block of 37th Road to a pedestrian plaza, installation of turning lanes on Broadway and some 37th Avenue cross-streets, pedestrian improvements on Roosevelt Avenue, and the addition of more parking on 69th Street.<br /><br />See the NYCDOT Jackson Heights Portal for details (http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/2011/09/16/implementation-continues-next-week/)<br /><br />

				I also live on 75th St. and didn&#039;t know about the traffic change until a couple of days before it happened.&nbsp; There were no signs up in our building, nothing sent through the mail, nothing.&nbsp; We were out of town for about 4 days and came home to the giant signs on 37th Ave. saying that the traffic would change direction that week.&nbsp; As a resident of 75th St. who finds myself reasonably aware of community issues I was shocked that there was no advance notice of this.&nbsp; And I can definitely see how some folks would have been left out of the discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, there&#039;s the possibility that people didn&#039;t know that buses were going to be re-routed and that the only change would be the direction of traffic.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t drive it probably was a non-issue until you found out that the buses were going to be re-routed.&nbsp; There was very little, if any, notice from the MTA that they would actually re-route the buses.<br /><br />There is a noticeable increase in traffic noise between the buses and cars honking.&nbsp; We hear this in our apartment even though we don&#039;t face the street - I can only imagine how those people with apartments facing the street must be frustrated.<br /><br />I was aware of the transit study (which was very well done, IMO); however, I only learned about it through this message board.<br /><br />Oh, and we lost a parking spot on my street, too.&nbsp; Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br />

				A full run-down to the planned changes to parking are available here:<br />http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/recommendations-changes-to-parking/<br /><br />Parking spaces are being eliminated near a number of intersections to create turn-lanes so that north-south traffic flows more safely and smoothly.&nbsp; Some blocks are being converted from regular parking meters to Muni meters, which will provide a slight increase in parking capacity.&nbsp; A new batch of unmetered parking spaces is also being created over on 69th Street.

				Maple, I sympathize. I am on 77th Street, too, and although the DOT claims the massive increase in honking had nothing to do with 75th Street (although the massive increase started the same day as the switch and has not ended), it is really bad right now. <br /><br />I posted another post (independent of this one) giving the number to call to complain. The timing on the green light on 77th needs to be increased, at the very least.

				That&#039;s good to hear about 77th St.&nbsp; We need a longer light on the north side of 75th St., too.&nbsp; Only about 4-5 cars can go through per green which is ridiculous given the amount of traffic down 75th St. now.&nbsp; Also, re-routing the buses down the street where Trade Fair parks its delivery trucks is a BAD idea.&nbsp; Those trucks are notorious for double-parking.&nbsp; A car can usually make it around but not a bus.&nbsp; This blocks the traffic all the way up the block.&nbsp; I&#039;ve called the 115th Precinct a couple of times about this but there&#039;s nothing they can do.<br />I also contacted the DOT, I&#039;m waiting for a response.<br />What led them to change the light on 77th St.?

				I agree, Tom. Clearly, 73rd Street was suffering, and I&#039;m glad they found some relief, but the fact is that this didn&#039;t solve the issue for the neighborhood; just shifted it so two other streets are also suffering. The double-parking on 75th sounds like a serious issue with the buses. DOT needs to come up with a better solution overall.<br /><br />I also think the presence of PS 69 near these heavily trafficked streets is a little alarming, considering frustrated drivers will do dumb things to make it through lights.

The entire neighborhood should have been included but that doesn&#039;t serve some people&#039;s interests.

				I think the petition that&#039;s going around 75th Street is ill advised. The idea of petitioning to simply change everything back to the way it was is ridiculous. Couldn&#039;t affected residents on 75th Street form a committee or something to talk with the Department Of Transportation about changes / tweaks that would make things better for them while remembering that they are part of a larger neighborhood that is also affected by traffic issues ? <br /><br />Circulating a petition that jumps straight to a demand to reverse the decisions that were made after years of study and community input doesn&#039;t leave much room for rational conversation that could yield better results.

Western JH is not really protected in any of the same ways as the historic district. We might have designation from the federal and state government but nothing from the city. That means that all sorts of things can and do happen that couldn&#039;t within the historic boundries as presently defined.

				The petition on 75th Street is in response to unproductive emails/conversations with Maura McCarthy of the DOT and Council Member Danny Dromm. It is not an ultimatum, but an attempt to reopen the dialogue by showing strength in numbers. Removing those flyers from poles and business windows is cowardly. Furthermore, to describe a simple flyer as an infraction to the beauty of Jackson Heights is absurd. How can anyone who cares about the &quot;beauty&quot; of this neighborhood be immune to the filth, noise, and chaos that is spilling over from the business district?! Take off your rose colored glasses and get real. The outcome of this study just pitted one street against another and failed to address the fact that driving/parking/living in J.H. is an urban nightmare.

				Flyers placed on lamp posts and trees is littering, no matter what they are advertising. Whether it is a hotel that rents by the hour or a community petition, posting flyers like that is illegal. <br /><br />The petition that is going around demands that changes be reversed, it says nothing about reopening a conversation. Further, it is unclear as to who is really behind this petition since it&#039;s only signed &quot;Residents of 75th Street&quot; no one&#039;s name is on it no one is taking responsibility for it. But someone is claiming to represent all the residents of 75th Street by circulating it. If you think taking down illegal signs is cowardly, so is circulating an anonymous petition. <br /><br />Has anyone requested a meeting with DOT or Dromm&#039;s office ? If so did they flat out say no? I find that really hard to believe.&nbsp;

				Setting up a protest site in Zuccotti Park is also illegal, but it was necessary in order to draw attention to a crisis that isn&#039;t being adequately addressed. The same holds true for those petition flyers that are requesting (not demanding) that the DOT review and reverse their decision to change the flow of traffic and move 2 bus routes to 75th St. (no mention of moving them back to 73rd St. as far as I can see).<br /><br />Danny Dromm&#039;s response to a letter signed by a 75th Street co-op board: Discuss this matter with Maura McCarthy.<br /><br />Maura McCarthy&#039;s resonse: The DOT is still evaluating the area (e.g., by tweaking the amount of green light time), but has no plans to change any of the study&#039;s major implentations.

				The buses weren&#039;t moved from 73rd Street because residents of that street didn&#039;t want the buses there. &nbsp;If the MTA did that, they&#039;d be shuffling bus routes around all the time, depending on who complained the loudest in any given year. &nbsp;The buses were moved from 73rd Street because that street couldn&#039;t handle all of the traffic that was trying to squeeze onto it. &nbsp;It is a narrow street that was simultaneously serving as a commercial strip, a transit route, a route for local traffic, and a route for cars dropping passengers off at the subway station. &nbsp; The changes that the city implemented were designed to distribute this activity more evenly through the neighborhood.<br /><br />I think that overall, these changes work well, and are a big net positive for the community as a whole. &nbsp;And I say that as a resident of a building along 77th Street, which saw some increased traffic as a result of the changes. &nbsp; DOT was responsive to the earlier problems with not enough capacity on the lights on 77th Street, and from what I can tell, the problem has largely been addressed. &nbsp;If there are similar problems with capacity on 75th Street, then I haven&#039;t seen them.

				Yes, one of the critical problems with the buses on 73rd Street was that because 73rd was bumper-to-bumper so much of the time, buses would get stuck (usually between 35th and 37th Avenues) and it would delay the schedules. Nothing was moving.<br /><br />I think the larger problem is that too many businesses in the 73rd/74th Street corridors seem to rely on people coming from Richmond Hill and Nassau County by car, and there&#039;s no parking for those people. Street parking won&#039;t solve this problem, and especially on weekends, too much of the traffic on 72/73/74 is people cruising for spaces. We need a municipal parking structure.
