				Many of Juju&#039;s patrons may be aware that Sam and his family have been working on a few changes to the café recently.&nbsp; The primary reason for the changes is that Sam is expanding his menu to include dinner.&nbsp; I stopped by earlier today, and he said his official launch date will be right after the Memorial Day holiday.&nbsp; Of course, he will have extended hours, and will now be offering Lebanese and Mediterranean cuisine.&nbsp; He&#039;s currently working on the new menu.&nbsp; I think this is exciting for the neighborhood, and I look forward to stopping by to sample the new offerings!

				That&#039;s awesome. I&#039;m sure whatever he does is going to be good. We have to make sure to actually go and make it worth it for him! Tourists don&#039;t go there, so it&#039;s all about us locals.

				I&#039;m willing to go out on a limb and say enthusiastically that I think Juju&#039;s bagels are quite good.&nbsp; Yes, some bagel bakeries that boil and bake them fresh on the premises are better, but that&#039;s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison, is it?&nbsp; I think Juju&#039;s is better than the other bagel shops further east in the neighborhood, and much better than what was available in the immediate area before they came along.&nbsp; Their bagels are also better than the bagel shops near where I work in Lower Manhattan (which have recently grown oversized and fluffy).&nbsp; Even putting aside their delicious non-bagel offerings, I&#039;m grateful they&#039;re here.

				Juju&#039;s is a one-man band, and the quality of the food he cooks is very good. He obviously sells far more than just bagels and spreads--the &quot;bagel shop&quot; name is not accurate in terms of what he actually offers. He probably thought it would be a good draw, so that&#039;s the name he chose. But it doesn&#039;t reflect the scope of the place. I often go for lunch on the weekends, and usually get an omelet or panini. I&#039;m very critical and fussy about food, and I really like the place. <br /><br />He just opened up for dinner and I hope people will support him. He has a Lebanese menu and a Mediterranean menu--a type of food I love and that is lacking in Jackson Heights, with the exception of Plaka, which is a bit out of the way. I&#039;m really excited about this.

				Wanted to have dinner there last night--alas, he has decided he needs more prep work before really opening for dinner. Don&#039;t know how long that will take, but he was open Wed and Thurs for dinner, then closed last night. Regarding wine/beer: I was planning to take a bottle of wine and assumed he&#039;d be okay with that, since he obviously does not have a wine/beer license. (Is that different, by the way, from a full liquor license?) <br /><br />Also, I was surprised to learn from this board awhile ago that BYOB is actually illegal in NYC. Seems such an established concept that I was shocked by that. If so, I suppose you can&#039;t post a BYOB policy openly, but can perhaps allow it unofficially. Better would be to serve wine/beer. I wonder how hard that is to arrange? Ricki&#039;s does it and so does the pizza place, Due Fratelli. They have beer anyway, not sure about wine. (And I do not recommend actually ordering the wine I once had at Ricki&#039;s.)

				He said today &quot;right after the fourth of July,&quot; and expressed happiness that people seemed into his idea.<br /><br />on the BYOB thing, fine, it&#039;s illegal. For the 40 or so years i have lived here, restaurants have been allowing it, putting large signs in their windows suggesting it, placing newspaper ads advertising it and trumpeting that &quot;we can keep our prices low because it&#039;s BYOB.&quot;<br /><br />i have not heard of or seen a single one get a single citation in four decades.

				My impression is that for several years Sammy has been opening and closing when he feels like. That has had a quirky charm but it hasn&#039;t enabled customers to anticipate when food is available, especially on weekdays after working hours.&nbsp; If he really sticks to the hours noted here, it would be splendid news. A great Lebanese restaurant open on weeknights would be a welcome addition to the &#039;hood.

				I&#039;m sorry to report that Sammy says he &quot;decided not to do it. We are too small.&quot;&nbsp; We won&#039;t have a Lebanese restaurant in the &#039;hood unless someone else decides to open it. My family, at least, is very disappointed.

				We are also disappointed! We love that type of food, his cooking is great, :( and Juju&#039;s is right on our block. Will continue going there on the weekends for lunch sometimes, but when we really need great food is dinner, especially during the week. :(

				that may explain his decision to take this past week off.<br /><br />i really like him and his family, and i really like the food he actually cooks, but i don&#039;t see him sticking around for much longer - the random days off for no reason, opening and closing on a whim during days when he&#039;s open. the place doesn&#039;t really seem like a priority for him.

				So sad for Sammy! Very nice guy with a very nice family, but never seemed like he found enough help or support to do everything he wants to do.<br /><br />Very difficult to make money in restaurants / food service with one small location

				I&#039;m so confused! I thought he had just decided to start doing this last week? Why the sudden change of heart before seeing if it worked out? I know it&#039;s not my right to know or anything, I just had been very excited to try it after all the chatter on here, but hadn&#039;t gotten around to it and now it seems like it&#039;s ending before it even began. <br /><br />Perplexed about whether things were maybe represented on this board as more certain than they ever really were, or if he really did a complete 180 on this idea right when he said he would be giving it a try.

				Well, he told people he was going to do this, he announced the new hours, he handed out the new menu to me, and he actually did provide dinner service one night--I stopped by when I saw the place lit up. The next day he closed for the rest of that week. <br /><br />Then he told people he was going to start dinner right after the 4th of July. I spoke to him several times about it, so yes, he had full intentions of doing this and even closed to renovate a bit to prepare for it, and had someone lined up to do the cooking for him. <br /><br />I think he just found it all too daunting, and maybe realized belatedly that he couldn&#039;t really pull it off. The place has always been a one-man show, and that&#039;s how he is used to operating. Maybe he tried to envision a new incarnation of the place, run a new way, and in the end just was not comfortable with it. Maybe it takes too many managerial/business/administrative skills vs cooking skills. It&#039;s too bad because his food is great and it&#039;s a type of food that is missing from the neighborhood.

				i had the exact same experience as ljr, right down to the menu perusal - he had a sample, printed out and laminated, and i was happy to see some of my favorites, including mujjadara, on it.<br /><br />he did do dinner service that one day, then closed for the rest of the week - perhaps to ponder his decision. i feel bad for him; for his own good, not our selfish needs, he should have thought over the expansion. i would imagine that plan had something to do with his renovating the kitchen earlier this spring.

				Thanks dssjh &amp; ljr for clarifying... sounds very disappointing, and certainly more for Sammy than his excited potential new customers. I do hope Juju stays open in its current state at least, even though the dinner plan won&#039;t be happening.

				I was really looking forward to the Lebanese food. That&#039;s too bad. Not opening until 11 am on weekdays when you serve bagels (good or not) seems odd. Well, best of luck to him.

				just hummus. a couple varieties, and a couple of chicken and tuna salads. no falafel, no grape leaves, nothing like that. he does one or two daily specials - pastas, grilled fish or chicken - and a soup or two in cooler months. just about everything is very good (though i&#039;m &#039;meh&#039; on his tomato sauce).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16466.msg79958.html#msg79958">Quote from: JH3525 on July 10, 2017, 01:27:40 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A Question:&nbsp; Does Juju&#039;s Cafe have prepared take out such as Baba Ghanouj, Hommos, Tabouli, Spinach Pie, Falafel, Grape Leaves, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been to Juju&#039;s twice and that was several years ago.&nbsp; I would be perfectly happy with take out and since I work from home, I could easily be there by 5 PM when he closes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need a sit down Lebanese meal/table service.&nbsp; <br /><br />About once a month, I travel to Souk El Shater in Sunnyside for the items I mentioned above.&nbsp; This place is very small and has no tables and just a counter and 5 stools.&nbsp; I would prefer walking to Juju&#039;s and giving my business to a local who I believe also lives in JH&#039;s. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
