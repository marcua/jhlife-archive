					These polls are paid for by Amazon. Where you aware of that?!<br /><br />Maybe most people who answered didn’t have good information. This is not about me and my opinion. I’ve posted links for anyone to read by mainstream sources. It’s not to have some silly tiff on the internet. It’s so that people can understand what this company is about, what it’s like to work there, and how a major project like this can negatively impact the immediate area. Which is were we all reside.<br /><br />Many people have cited Seattle as a way to gauge the impact and that was why my initial post was about my friend who lives there and what he has experienced.

					Here is a report from the great low tax state of Arizona and how despite being able to attractive the tech industry, it is splitting up the work force because it is actually NOT getting spread around. Which is exactly what Amazon claimed WOULD happen in Queens in their testimony to city council.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/economy/productivity-inequality-wages.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/economy/productivity-inequality-wages.html</a><br /><br />Another, thing that was revealing at the hearings is that it is a non binding agreement and can be nullified.<br /><br />Read the links I posted, I don’t think you can say it’s a good thing for us. Just because areas of the city have gentrified doesn’t mean we need to sit down and except the terms that they are dictating to us. That’s not a democracy. <br />

					I think you you guys are misinterpreting the concern here. It is absolutely not about technology and fear of change or the new. This is about resources and how they are allocated. The city is at an all time population high and settling&nbsp; thousands more people in the area doesn&#039;t yield more or increase quality of life. It&#039;s a give away to one of the largest companies IN THE WORLD. And it&#039;s likely that the Governor and Mayor support it because they are politically ambitious and need contributions for their next campaigns. Look deeper. Don&#039;t just take it at face value by focusing on the tech element.<br /><br />Let Amazon move to a less populated area on NY. There are plenty of options within the state.<br /><br />If you want to use history as an example, multiple empires throughout civilizations collapsed by overexpanding. Corruption took hold when rulers were not being held accountable. And the groups at the bottom waged revolts because they were left with nothing else to lose. That is the seed of history. As true today as it was in ANY ancient culture.<br /><br />The English also greatly believed in a feudal system where there is no chance for upward mobility and that blood determines your station. And that&#039;s why Ned Ludd formed a rebellion. That is literally what the framers of the constitution were responding to. <br /><br /><br />

					I would say that anyone supporting this project is willfully putting their head in the sand and should go back and read this 2015 NY Times article about Amazon&#039;s toxic work place culture.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html</a><br /><br />I have been to both 3 1/2 hour city council meetings about this. Here is what was revealed. After pitting american cities against each other in a sham contest, Amazon is now pitting unions against each other by making agreements with one and parading them around but, refusing to make agreements with any others. <br /><br />They also flat out said they would not sign a neutrality agreement if workers wanted to organize. Meaning that if, maybe, people wanted to form a union in the future, they would intervene.<br /><br />My friend is a small business owner in Seattle. He has his own record shop. I asked if Amazon employees shop at the store or does the company support small businesses. His response was that they don&#039;t support brick and morter shops because they are pushing streaming and online services. The people who do shop there are actually from other countries here on work visas, not people from Seattle, Washington state, or even the US.<br /><br />Additionally, the city of Seattle is now plagued by traffic because a big part of tech culture is taking your own car somewhere with ride share apps. His friend drives a city bus and he can&#039;t go anywhere at work as a result of the added congestion. The topic of traffic, cars, and fatal accidents is a regular subject on this forum.<br /><br />I&#039;m confident it would be pretty easy for one of the largest tech companies to create a bunch of fake online profiles to sign petitions and post here in support of them. That&#039;s pretty much what they are in the business of doing, more or less fooling people.<br /><br />Please read the above link. <br />

This article from 1972 is about a similar concept, where there was a space and impartial party delegated to negotiate. This is some what of the origins of breakdancing. But, I don&#039;t expect that to happen again.<br /><br /><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48271/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48271/</a><br /><br />I lived in a major gang turf cross section in LA and one of those gangs was involved in this shooting (18th st). Three of the cities largest gangs intersected at my cross streets. There was a lot of &quot;activity&quot;.&nbsp; It seems that culture has spread to our city. <br /><br />That particular LAPD precinct at the time was one of the most militarized but, also notoriously corrupt. So, there you have a combination of resources and corruption. I respect most police officers but, the job is also not attracting the very best people. It&#039;s the same with the MTA and NYCHA workers. <br /><br />Tax dollars need to be audited and that can be an issue with a bureaucracy. Of course &quot;LESS&quot; government would only make the issue worse. DeBlasio has spent a lot on beefing up the police. There is no simple solution. Some citizens take to added resources and opportunities and others squander them and continue to commit crimes. It&#039;s not a black and white issue. Crime in this city has also fallen to record lows.

The Green New Deal could be a solution to our deteriorating infrastructure. Last year a highway collapsed in the Atlanta area. Transit tunnels in our own area continue to decay from salt water floods during sandy. On top of this there is the highest level of carbon in the atmosphere in the planets history. AND it went up last year. <br /><br />I&#039;m assuming from the cantankerous nature of your comment that you are an older person. So, maybe you don&#039;t care what happens to the planet. I&#039;ll still be here for the worst of it. And so will the rest of the small children living in the neighborhood today.<br /><br />Maybe you hate the AOC media circus. I&#039;m sure she does too. But, let&#039;s not dismiss this plan because a few cable news networks need ratings to show off to their advertisers.

					Even Paul Krugman says this is a good idea and he tends to be pretty measured in his evaluations. Basically, most very wealthy people make money off the gains on their investments. Most people don&#039;t understand this concept because they are used to getting paid for work they do. <br /><br />So, only earned income is taxed at 70% and the above 10 million set will still thrive because capitol gains are taxed at a lower rate. Which will probably be targeted in a future republican administration. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tax-policy-dance.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-tax-policy-dance.html</a>

I have attended so many of his town halls and I can almost hear his lame response to people urging him on climate action in light of the most recent news. What a jerk....<br />

This could be huge for pulling carbon out of our air. We now know that diesel fumes are even worse for us all to breathe. Especially children who are still developing. Just sitting on the bus exposes kids to these harmful fuels. I would love to see this expand to other cities.<br /><br />If you feel similarly, the councilman&#039;s office suggested spreading the word to friends in other neighborhoods so that more council members will support this program. Which would help it expand. So, please re-post the article.

					My parents are from Israel and my dad moved back in retirement. He was a HEAVY life long smoker and is a poster child for preexisting conditions. Since he has moved back he had a heart attack and pneumonia. Thanks to their healthcare system he was able to get the care he needed. He was able to stay in the hospital and not worry about the cost too much. He was VERY aware about how that would not have been the case here in the US. The cost of the two incidents here in the US would have absolutely eroded his retirement savings. <br /><br />I have to say that I get pretty irritated by all the politicians that jump up and down and bend over backwards over their support for Israel but, turn around and disparage any talk of universal healthcare. Israel IS a socialized country and yes people bare the tax burden of what that is. It is difficult to &quot;get ahead&quot; but, healthcare and care for seniors is never really an issue there.<br /><br />Even Crowley &quot;claimed&quot; to support medicare for all in the primary. He was probably just paying lip service to that knowing the burden would not really fall on him.<br /><br />My initial issue with Ocasio-Cortez was that her campaign was like she was running for Governor or Mayor. Really your congress person is just representing the interests of the district. They can propose bills but, it&#039;s not an executive role. I think she&#039;s been pretty straight up about what she is like and she won. It&#039;s good to have someone advocate for health care, the climate, and immigrants rights. Those are all things that we are effected by here in 14.
