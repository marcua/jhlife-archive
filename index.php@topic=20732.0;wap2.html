			&nbsp; Giving a shout out to UFC chicken - and now many other things - on Roosevelt and 71st. Give them another look if you haven&#039;t been lately. They have added delicious noodle dishes with glass noodles and veg, bulgogi sliders and fries. Poutine. And a host of other things on top of their delicious legs and wings that we have been enjoying for awhile. They also have one of the best beer menus in the neighborhood. Growlers for takeout. No I do not work for them but just respect them for continually improving and adding to their already wonderful menu and want to spread the word. It&#039;s a cute place too if you are eating in these days...

			glad to hear the shoutout. whenever i see a post title like this, i worry that it&#039;s an obit or post mortem. can only vouch for the chicken and beer but now i really want to explore further.
