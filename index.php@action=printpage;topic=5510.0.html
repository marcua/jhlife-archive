				A few weeks ago we noticed Himalayan Yak Restaurant across the street from Rice Avenue.&nbsp; We ate there earlier tonight and it was actually pretty incredible!&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t brave enough (this time) to try yak; maybe next time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both our appetizers (mushroom skewers, chicken corn soup) were delicious.&nbsp; For the main course we had a very tasty chicken/peppers/onions/mushrooms dish and a tofu/chicken/veggies dish.&nbsp; Both were really really good, and included a yummy doughy bun/roll.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan of restaurants with TVs (however they were airing a documentary about yaks, so it was appropriate.)<br /><br />And the waiter was cute; that&#039;s always a plus.<br />

				I went there and ordered the yak balls, which taste like beef.<br /><br />Food took forever to come out and there were only four other tables. Some things were burnt, too. I thought it was fun to try, but it found it meh.
