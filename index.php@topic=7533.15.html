Everyone I know drives there to park their car and take the N/Q train into the city when they go out!&quot; So, that&#039;s who&#039;s taking up the parking in Queens...but I get to crash at her place on Montauk so I don&#039;t mind too much!</div>

In addition to Major League Soccer&#039;s stadium plans, the Bloomberg administration has reached a tentative deal with developers to build a large mall to the west of Citi Field, and new parking lots, some retail and a hotel, (and perhaps also, ultimately, housing) to the stadium&#039;s east, on an industrial swath of land known as the Iron Triangle that now houses small businesses.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the U.S. Tennis Association wants to implement a $500 million expansion of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center that includes two new above-ground parking garages in the park.<br /><br />&quot;In my professional opinion, I think all of these plans are deeply flawed,&quot; said Donovan Finn, an urban planning professor at Stony Brook University, who gave the policy keynote of the night, complete with a slide show, and who argued that Major League Soccer would need at least 20 acres of parkland to build its stadium.<br /><br />Earlier estimates had Major League Soccer requesting fewer than 10 acres.<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s the new number from what I understand,&quot; said Finn, when asked where he got it.<br /><br />A Major League Soccer spokesperson told Capital that the stadium would need no more than 13 acres, which is both smaller than Finn&#039;s estimate and larger than the original ones.<br /><br />Either way, Major League Soccer will have to overcome several obstacles before it can break ground. It must find replacement parkland elsewhereâ€”a process it has already begunâ€”and then get state approval for the land swap.<br /><br />The stadium will also have to go through a land use review process that entails getting City Council approval.<br /><br />&quot;Out of all the proposals, Major League Soccer is one that the community embraces,&quot; said Councilmember Julissa Ferreras, whose district encompasses the park.<br /><br />But she said the league&#039;s timing is bad, with the stadium proposal coming at the same time as nearby USTA and Citi Field developments.<br /><br />&quot;It almost feels like everything is being rushed,&quot; she said.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/09/6537221/major-league-soccer-wont-get-queens-stadium-without-fight?politics-bucket-headline" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/09/6537221/major-league-soccer-wont-get-queens-stadium-without-fight?politics-bucket-headline</a></div>

If approved, construction could begin as soon as next summer. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Flushing-Meadows-Development-Town-Hall-Neighbors-Upset-Soccer-Field-Mall-170124556.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Flushing-Meadows-Development-Town-Hall-Neighbors-Upset-Soccer-Field-Mall-170124556.html</a></div>

Organized by Queens Congregations United for Action (QCUA), and the Fairness Coalition of Queens, they came together with elected officials, clergy, and community leaders to tell Mayor Bloomberg that their park is not for sale to real estate moguls and greedy merchants.<br /><br />â€œFamilies in Corona need living wage jobs and affordable housing, not massive stadiums or shopping malls that will create poverty-wage jobs and only serve the interests of wealthy developers,â€ said Msgr. Thomas Healy, pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows which has 10,000 members whose families depend on the park.<br /><br />Healy was referring to a press conference held last June 15 by Bloomberg and the New York Economic Development Corporation to announced that plans for Willets Point, which had been approved in 2008 after extensive pubic review, had been significantly revised. The new developments, backed by a partnership of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, were decided with little or no community input.<br /><br />The new plan will begin undergoing an additional environmental review later this month and calls for developing public parkland for private use. The idea is to build a 1,400,000-square foot mall, two new stadiums and concert venues, several new parking garages and new roads valued at over three billion dollars. Construction of 2,000 units of affordable housing that were part of the original plan would now be delayed until 2025.<br /><br />In addition, developers representing the New York Mets, the United States Tennis Association and Major League Soccer also want to develop public parkland for private use in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and are lobbying city and state officials for the right to do so.<br />â€œImagine what would happen if they were proposing to build a stadium and a shopping mall in Central Park or in Prospect Park,â€ said Joseph McKellar, QCUAâ€™s executive director. â€œThe community is really upset, among other things, because the mayor had made a commitment to build affordable housing and now went back on that commitment. They are doing this because they think Latinos, which are the majority in this area, do not have any power.â€<br /><br />For 72 years, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the biggest green space in Queens, has been a place where thousands of families from across the borough come to â€œlearn, play, and build community,â€ McKellar said. The neighborhoods surrounding the park depend on it as some of the only open space in Queens. Resident are some of the poorest in the city: 75% are people of color and 40% live in poverty.<br />â€œThe construction of these developments would mean losing precious parkland used by 20,000 youth and adult recreational soccer players every week from adjacent neighborhoods,â€ McKellar said. â€œBesides, there is real concern about what, if any, benefits these developments would bring to the community.â€<br /><br />As the people gathered at the Corona church made clear Monday night, the community is saying no to the traffic these luxury projects would bring, and to poverty wages and seasonal jobs. What they are struggling for is affordable housing and jobs that pay living wages, not for a group of billionaire developers gutting their park to become even richer.<br /><br />The message from Queens residents to Bloomberg and wealthy developers is clear and to the point: Flushing Meadows-Corona Park belongs to the community and is not for sale.<br />&nbsp;<br />by Albor Ruiz <br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/residents-voice-opposition-massive-development-plans-flushing-meadows-corona-park-article-1.1162125#ixzz26v2aYZ4a" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/residents-voice-opposition-massive-development-plans-flushing-meadows-corona-park-article-1.1162125#ixzz26v2aYZ4a</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_45711">I hate our clown of a mayor and cannot WAIT until he leaves office. &nbsp;He has turned New York into a movie set for bad romantic comedies - and yes, I hate everything he&#039;s done, even the High Line, even 311, everything. &nbsp;His short-term, max-profit strategy for the city is so indicative of his background in the financial services industry. &nbsp;My mild annoyance at his tenure turned to full-on disgust after his appointment on Cathie Black as school chancellor; more than anything that just illustrated how completely blind he is to the needs of working people in New York. &nbsp;He is a joke. I&#039;m sorry if I am not more articulate but the more I read about this development plan the more furious I become. There are SO many things you can do to improve the Flushing Meadows area and bring economic revitalization to the area that doesn&#039;t involve massive over-development and damage to the community - it&#039;s a big green space, but it is supremely underused because the paths through it are often desolate, and there&#039;s very little actual infrastructure by way of transportation, actual play areas, nice gardens, etc. &nbsp;If he were to invest in that in a smart way he&#039;d have the opportunity to bring beautiful park access to an area and population of Queens that sorely, sorely needs it. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;:tickedoff: :tickedoff: :tickedoff:<br /><br />And this feeds into why I hate the idea of the High Line and not the park itself - why is it that the West Village gets $152+ million architectural wonder of a park and Queens gets more malls, more stadiums through a poorly laid-out traffic grid, more parking lot, and the carving up of a green space that serves overcrowded communities? </div>

The entire project will require 0.76 more acres of parkland to be added to the tennis center.<br /><br />And over the summer, Major League Soccer began talking with Queens lawmakers about building a 9-acre stadium on the site of some derelict fountains from the 1964 Worldâ€™s Fair.<br /><br />â€œAll this council is asking for is that we have a voice in the process,â€ Finn said.<br /><br />The coalition distributed pledge cards where those in attendance could sign up to flood 311 with phone calls, hand out informational fliers in the park or even testify at an upcoming hearing about Willets Point.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.timesledger.com/assets/photos/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q3_joeanuta_i.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><em>Javier Valdez and Luz Muy introduce members of the coalition at a rally over development in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Msgr Thomas Healy claps in the background. </em><br /><br />But state Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst) contended that the proposed soccer stadium enjoys widespread in the community, which would seem to contradict the tone of Mondayâ€™s meeting.<br /><br />â€œA privately funded soccer stadium to replace a big hole in the ground filled with dirty water is a good deal for soccer fans and the park-goers who would get to enjoy the many upgrades to the park,â€ he said. â€œAnd we can certainly use the construction, game-day and permanent jobs that the stadium would create.â€<br /><br /><a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q.html</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_45719">&nbsp;Is this about a soccer stadium for MLS quality games? Or are we talking pretty substantial reconfiguring park space in<br />Flushing Meadows park? These are two very different agendas. I agree with a few other posters and Peralta in that <br />the soccer stadium alone in an underused area would be great for the area. Taking lot&#039;s of other land in the park<br />from the meager amount of space that is crappily maintained for the many other soccer fans there every weekend<br />is not good! Taking more space for tennis when there are already two stadiums plus seems crazy. Then taking more<br />space for another mall right in that area means someone has taken leave of their senses. Or is noting the monies<br />made at the Queens Center mall currently.<br />&nbsp; I think a quality soccer stadium with an educational component and community leagues for all ages, male and <br />female would be a HUGE plus for the neighborhood. One only has to go to St. Mikes park near the BQE any weekend<br />or weeknight and see how every square inch is coveted by local players to know the need is here. And the same goes<br />for the countless games all over the park in Flushing Meadows every weekend. BUT do not lump this with the other<br />items on the agenda like the tennis and shopping components. And while we are at it, please someone clean up <br />Flushing Meadows park so it looks somewhat as tidy and recognizable in other parts of the year as it does for the<br />US Open. No one wants to lose park space but the area proposed for the soccer stadium can change in an asset<br />from a liability in its current state. Not so for the additional elements...</div>

Because the sites are on public parkland, any development would need approval from both the City Council and state legislature and would have to mitigate the used land with an equal amount of new parkland in another location within New York City, not necessarily in Queens.<br /><br />Major League Soccer is reportedly eyeing land behind the Hall of Science to build a nine-acre, $300 million, 25,000-seat facility and nine public soccer fields. The league said it would fund renovations of public sports fields within the park, including cricket, soccer and volleyball fields along with adding parkland to the city.<br /><br />A $500 million project is planned to update and revitalize the U.S. Tennis Associationâ€™s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center with two new stadiums and two parking garages.<br /><br />Lastly, a 1,400,000-square-foot shopping mall on public land was proposed for Willets West, a section of the park now used for parking next to Citi Field, which is on public land, and Willets Point, which is not on park property.<br /><br />â€œThere is some confusion, but Willets West is on public park land,â€ said Joseph McKellar, a spokesman with the Queens Congregations United for Action.<br /><br />â€œWe use the park to play soccer. Itâ€™s where our children learn to play. We donâ€™t just want to watch soccer, we want to play,â€ Make the Road New York Deputy Director Theo Oshiro said.<br /><br />Many people cheered and clapped when speakers denounced the possible loss of open space, but one retired nurse and Corona resident, Elna Tullock, said all development would be good.<br /><br />â€œThereâ€™s lots of space, but thatâ€™s my opinion,â€ Tullock said. â€œItâ€™s good to have these meetings to express ideas.â€<br /><img src="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qchron.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/1e/21e13882-f0e5-5e1d-bb89-f86329ed5d07/505b355ad7231.image.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Politicians and spokespeople with QCUA, MRNY and several other Queens community organizations who hosted the town hall want to start a conversation wherein the community, which has a large poor and immigrant population, has a say in the future of the park.<br /><br />â€œNeighbors of the park should have a seat at the table and a say in what is happening in their backyard,â€ Oshiro said.<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-East Elmhurst) said she will be meeting with all the developers and they will â€œhave to sellâ€ the proposals to the community<br /><br />â€œEvery inch of developed parkland is park space we wonâ€™t get back,â€ Ferreras said.<br /><br />Although not public land, development at Willets Point, across 126th Street from Citi Field, was also a point of concern. In 2008 the city council approved the Willets Point redevelopment project, which included 2,000 affordable housing units. However, in June of this year Mayor Bloomberg and the Economic Development Corp. announced the Willets West plan and said the affordable houses would be delayed until 2025.<br /><br />â€œThatâ€™s not just. We had a promise,â€ said Our Lady of Sorrows Pastor Thomas Healy, adding that the plan is unfair to neighborhood residents who already live two and three families to one apartment.<br /><br />Auto mechanics who have shops on 126th Street in the Willets Point area are worried about the development, according to Sergio Aguirre, a community organizer for the Sunrise Co-op, a coalition of 60 shops in the Willets Point area.<br /><br />â€œThey want to displace workers like animals,â€ he said, adding that the co-op is asking the government to help with a relocation to Maspeth.<br /><br />All proposals would include constructing more roads and adding more car traffic in the park, Donovan Finn of the Jackson Heights Green Alliance said. MLSâ€™ plans would include a shuttle from the No. 7 train to the proposed soccer stadium.<br /><br />In addition to the eating up of open parkland and increasing traffic, speakers said the proposed developments would bring part-time jobs without benefits when the neighborhood needs â€œgood jobs,â€ Maria Alvarez with MRNY said.<br /><br />Residents broke into small groups and discussed what the park means to them, which for most meant recreation and family. A follow-up meeting will be held on Sept. 27 at PS 19 at 98-02 Roosevelt Avenue at 6:30 p.m.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/neighbors-want-say-in-park-s-future/article_3738a87d-0a25-5994-ace1-842d33255bd4.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/neighbors-want-say-in-park-s-future/article_3738a87d-0a25-5994-ace1-842d33255bd4.html</a></div>

Tony Avella (D-Bayside), Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-Elmhurst), Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), and Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-St. Albans) joined hundreds of residents for a town hall meeting held at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Corona.<br /><br />&nbsp; Officiated by Monsignor Thomas Healy, pastor of the 10,000 member church, the meeting hosted numerous public testimonies against the string of the proposed plans as well as discussions and suggestions for alternative improvements.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œWe are the closest community to Willets Point. Thatâ€™s why we are here tonight,â€ Healy said. â€œFamilies in Corona need living wage jobs, not massive stadiums or shopping malls that will create poverty-wage jobs and only serve the interests of wealthy developers.â€ <br /><br />&nbsp; In addition to protesting against the Willets Point development Mayor Mike Bloomberg announced in June, which would include the construction of a 1.4 million square foot shopping mall on public parkland, residents in attendance also voiced concerns over proposals made by the United States Tennis Association and Major League Soccer, who are currently lobbying for park alienation rights.<br /><br />&nbsp; The USTAâ€™s proposal is expected to face a public review this fall and if approved, would call for a $500 million expansion of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Plans would include the construction of two new stadiums, two parking garages and relocation of seven tournament courts among other minor infrastructure and utility improvements.<br /><br />&nbsp; Meanwhile, MLS, which has yet to strike a final deal with the City, is seeking support from the City Council to build a $300 million stadium on the site of what is now the Pool of Industry at the park. <br /><br />&nbsp; Supported by State Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst), who did not attend the town hall meeting, the stadium would call for the filling of the pool and incorporation of a concert venue on park grounds. <br /><br />&nbsp; â€œA privately funded soccer stadium to replace a big hole in the ground filled with dirty water is a good deal for soccer fans and the park-goers who would get to enjoy the many upgrades to the park,â€ Peralta said. â€œAnd we can certainly use the construction, game-day and permanent jobs that the stadium would create.â€<br /><br />&nbsp; While Peraltaâ€™s office vouched for the plenty of folks who support the construction of the stadium and the upgrades to the park that would go with it, Ferreras said that the poor timing of the MLS may be the cause of some of the existing community opposition.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIt almost feels like everything is being rushed,â€ Ferreras said. <br /><br />&nbsp; <strong>In a comprehensive video presentation given at the meeting, Donovan Finn, a Queens resident and visiting assistant professor of policy planning and design at Stony Brook University, stated that if each of the proposals are approved, Flushing Meadowsâ€™ public park space would be reduced from 1,255 acres to a mere couple hundred acres.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIn my professional opinion, I think all of these plans are deeply flawed,â€ Finn said. â€œThe biggest problem is that all of these developers are acting as if the other plans do not exist.â€ <br /><br />&nbsp; As he concluded his presentation, Finn echoed much of the crowdâ€™s sentiments by urging City officials to take the publicâ€™s concerns into careful consideration before moving forward with plans to alter the park.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIf this stuff gets built, it will never be park land again,â€ Finn said. â€œItâ€™s an enormous opportunity to change the course of history.â€ </strong></div>
