				The nighttime cashier at Trade Fair was being interviewed by the police when I was on the checkout line earlier this morning. (My receipt says 04:16.) The line wasnâ€™t moving, and I heard him tell the police he was robbed at gunpoint at his register. The officers were very impatient with him, seemingly annoyed he didnâ€™t anticipate their questions. When they asked for a description of the perpetrator, the cashier started by describing his height, but the officers wanted him to start with an ethnic description (â€œWas he white, black, Hispanic, Indian?â€), so the cashier said the robber was â€œSpanish.â€ They seemed annoyed he took a moment to answer the subjective question of whether the robber was light- or dark-skinned. The cashier did explicitly say he had seen the gun. The waiting customers were moved to another register, staffed by the manager, where we could pay only by credit or debit card. At that time, the manager told the police he estimated over three hundred dollars had been stolen. Just before I left, the police were not allowing new customers in and were telling them the store was closed.

				It has been my experience that as soon as the police shows up they want immediate details so they can put the call out to all cars within the sector.&nbsp; Also, as soon as a call goes in to a 911 dispatcher, all details of the perp is valuable.&nbsp; The officers can hopefully secure an immediate arrest.&nbsp; The delay in details, is the delay in catching the perp.&nbsp; But Trade Fair must have security cameras, which should be very helpful to the officers as well. <br /><br />As the economy gets worse, more people will be desperate.&nbsp; Unfortunately, desperate people, do desperate things. <br /><br />People are losing their homes, jobs, and can&#039;t put food on their tables.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very sad situation.

However, the police should have asked more specific questions to elicit the answers they wanted. If theyâ€™re going to become exasperated when the cashier starts to describe the perpetratorâ€™s height, they might have asked something more specific than â€œWhatâ€™dâ€™e look like?â€ Even when they caught on that they should specifically ask about ethnicity, clothing etc., they seemed to be berating him for making them do so, as if he should have known to start with ethnicity, move on to clothing etc. Of course, this is all my (possibly inaccurate) impression as bystander; I was at the check-out line very briefly.

				I imagine that if I had just had a gun pointed at me, it might take a little longer for me to collect my thoughts. Catching the perp is of the utmost importance, but agitating the victim can only lead to inaccurate information.

				Hmm,The Gothamist newsmap had armed robbery,74st/Roosevelt Ave,4:15am. I think that was the location for the mobilization point for the NYPD. Don&#039;t they have a security guard at the store overnight? Hopefully they have him on the security cameras either inside or outside the store. I bet the perp is a druggie with a rap sheet as long as your arm. I don&#039;t buy that &quot;because of the economy people will do&nbsp; desperate things&quot;....A rational thinking person isn&#039;t going to risk going to prison for 10+yrs for a couple of hundred dollars.

				I totally agree snickers. No normal person would commit such an horrific act. We&#039;ve all fallen on hard times that doesnt mean crime is the answer. There are food pantries, collecting bottles, shoveling snow, housecleaning, selling your items on ebay etc etc.-there are options (not exactly fun but...) NO excuse for crime

				There is no excuse for crime.&nbsp; But is a person rational when he commits the crime?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think so.&nbsp; And again desperate people do desperate things.&nbsp; Whether it be to feed the kids, or feed their drug habit.&nbsp; And these are unusually desperate times.&nbsp; :smiley6600:
