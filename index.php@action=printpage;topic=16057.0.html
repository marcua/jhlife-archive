				If you’re thinking of doing work in your apartment, you should give Eddie Corrigan a call first. We recently finished a gut renovation of our kitchen and could not be happier with the result. We had several unique challenges—we moved a steam pipe, updated the electrical, and combined Ikea and custom cabinetry—Eddie handled it all with total professionalism at very fair price. <br /><br />Looking back, we wish he had also done our bathroom. <br /><br />Eddie is licensed and insured. His crew is polite and tidy (as far as any reno is tidy). And he knows the buildings. He works all around Jackson Heights, especially the pre-war and garden co-ops. <br /><br />What I think really sets Eddie a cut above other contractors is how flexible and adaptable he is. We had the design plan, but when problems came up—and they always come up—he finds creative solutions and doesn’t gouge you for unexpected costs. <br /><br />Contact info:<br />Eddie Corrigan<br />corriganservice@aol.com<br />917-748-3620<br /><br />(http://s3.amazonaws.com/KN.Share/kitchen1.jpg)<br />(http://s3.amazonaws.com/KN.Share/kitchen2.jpg)<br /><br /><br />

				your kitchen looks beautiful! The layout of your kitchen is very similar to our kitchen. You must live in Linden Court Apartments. I am very interested in potentially hiring him to redo our kitchen. Would you mind PMing me the cost of the total renovation? <br />

				It does look great!&nbsp; Well balanced and tasteful.<br /><br />Linden Court here too.&nbsp; I noticed there is no riser between the stove and the sink.&nbsp; Is it behind the walls or did he 4th floor cap it?<br /><br />If you wouldn&#039;t mind, I&#039;d like a pm of the total cost as well.&nbsp; Our building&#039;s dumbwaiter hasn&#039;t worked in years and we are kicking around the idea of turning that into a pantry.

				The steam riser was split in two with the main riser being set into the wall, and a capped pipe run around the stove to the back wall in the event a future owner wants to connect a small radiator. The pipe is exposed where it comes up through the floor, so we had the ventilated door on the bottom row custom made to prevent the heat from building up inside and warping the wood. <br /><br />Our dumbwaiter is still in use, alas. Otherwise we would have looked at doing something similar. Although I actually think that the shaft would be good for running the conduits for wall-mounted air conditioners—the ones with exterior compressors. But, of course, you have to sell the whole building on that plan.

				Want to recommend them as well.&nbsp; A few years ago, I did our kitchen with my carpenter brother-in-law, but neither of us were experienced with plaster.&nbsp; We called them, and they did a fantastic job on the plaster, and the final results were/are great!&nbsp;

				Here is another shout-out for Eddie Corrigan and Corrigan Services renovation. I hired Eddie last winter to do a gut renovation of an estate sale “train wreck” of an apartment at Roosevelt Terrace. I bought this apartment while I was still living in Boston so the renovation was “long distance.” I described the “look” I wanted – an open plan (as much as was possible within structural confines), modern “loft” look and, while we wrote down little, he made it happen. At times, he made suggestions, most of which were good, including removing part of a wall to the bedroom area and picking the kitchen cabinets. Every couple of weeks, I came to NYC to look at what he was doing and make decisions with him. People wondered at my trust in Eddie but the trust was well placed. He did a beautiful job, creating a great modern kitchen, making a small bathroom feel just a bit bigger by raising the ceiling, getting the peninsula between living area and kitchen just right, changing the closets. He quoted me a price and that’s what it cost. Working with Eddie was so straightforward and honest plus he is a craftsman so the work looks great, so much better than renovations I saw while I was apartment-hunting.<br />Eddie Corrigan<br />Corriganservices@aol.com<br />917 748-3620<br />

				I also had used Corrigan Services by Eddie Corrigan for some renovation work in our apartment, and unfortunately, I had a completely different experience compared to others who had provided positive comments here. I don&#039;t think there is a perfect contractor out there. My advice is to be sure to get quotes from different contractors and go with your gut instinct vs. relying solely on reviews from others.&nbsp; I recommend getting everything in writing (which means unfortunately that in most cases you do the writing yourself and have the contractor cosign). Be firm when contractors do not complete tasks that had been outlined in the signed work proposal by pointing that out and making sure those things are being done. I recommend touching base with the contractor more than once a day - better if in the morning, middle of the day, and end of the day. Communication is the key. <br />

				I need to update my kitchen soon and have few questions for all.<br /><br />I actually like my kitchen, but the person who had it done before I bought the place used the cheapest cabinets possible and they are falling apart.&nbsp; I suspect that I will have to replace everything when I put in new cabinets - anyone have an experience like that?<br /><br />I love the stove - what brand and model is it?<br /><br />Has anyone had custom cabinets made - are they better quality?&nbsp; Any recommendations on good quality cabinets?<br /><br />Also I&#039;d like the cost pm&#039;d to me.<br /><br />Thanks all.

				Knatchez, would you mind telling me how long your renovation took, from when you called Eddie to when the work was completed? I&#039;m going to be closing on a coop in Jackson Heights soon, and I&#039;m going to have to renovate the kitchen and bathroom before moving in, so I&#039;m trying to get a sense of the timeframe. In fact, if anyone else would like to share how long their kitchen or bathroom renovations took, I&#039;d love to hear it!

				<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">I’m happy to be able to add another positive recommendation for Eddie Corrigan, who renovated my kitchen recently. <br /><br />It was my first time renovating so there was a steep learning curve, but Eddie was patient with my lack of knowledge (not to mention excess anxiety) and helpful every step of way. I never got the feeling that he took advantage of my inexperience.&nbsp; <br /><br />The job was pretty straight forward with the exception of my walls--evidently the plaster lathe walls in my kitchen are bowed in assorted spots around various pipes, but they did a remarkable job of getting all the cabinets to hang evenly, flush with each other and flush with the wall all along. (Now I understand why the old cabinets had bizarre random gaps everywhere, including between the wall and cabinets). In addition to looking good/normal, I’m confident they are all secure and I can load them up. <br /><br />One bowed wall also presented a challenge for the counter but Eddie had them use a scribe when they measured so the counters sit beautifully flush all along as well. He also took extra care with the backsplash installation so the spacing between tiles would remain even. I’m not sure how any other contractor would’ve handled this wonky wall situation, but it seemed to me I was reaping huge dividends from his experience and integrity (and also the high quality of his craftsmen and team.)<br /><br />Speaking of walls and quality, they also skim coated (and painted) a hallway ceiling and wall, and OMG what a revelation….I had no idea regular plaster walls (even good condition ones) looked so bad until I saw the magic of skim coating. I can’t say I would have it done on every wall in my apartment, but I sure am looking forward to having it done in select other places.<br /><br />Hot2015 makes some good suggestions above as now I can see clearly how important it is to connect in some way with one’s contractor. Also, if I ever renovate something again I would quadruple the level of details on my lists, at minimum. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire Eddie Corrigan again though as I really appreciated his high standards and experience.</span>

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Way back in 2008,when I moved to JH, we had the luxury of working on the new co-op for a few months before moving in.&nbsp; I decided to tackle the kitchen Reno with my brother-in-law, and after the demo and Sheetrock, we decided that we needed a real plasterer to get things ready to hang cabinets(IKEA). <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Eddie was recommended by my Super, and after a quick look around he provided an estimate.&nbsp; Since I was working, we gave him a key, and he completed the job in 2 days!&nbsp; It was very convenient for me, and we were able to move forward with the cabinet install without issues.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Eddie has done done great work for many of my immediate neighbors, where there was a serious leak, and the finished product looks great.&nbsp; So I would recommend him as well.&nbsp; <br />Thanks.&nbsp;
