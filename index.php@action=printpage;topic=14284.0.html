				If you&#039;re looking for a co-op in Jackson Heights (or know someone who is), you don&#039;t want to miss this gorgeous 1BR/1BA for sale in the Carlton House (34-41 85th Street, between 34th and 35th Avenues).<br /><br />Asking price is $375,000. View pictures and more at the NY Times Real Estate (http://www.nytimes.com/real-estate/usa/ny/queens/jackson-heights/homes-for-sale/34-41-85th-street-2r/87-158931#) site. <strong>You can see this gem for yourself at the Open House, this Sunday, January 24, from 12pm-1pm</strong>.<br /><br />Feel free to contact me privately with any questions or to set up a different viewing time.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">About the Apartment:</span><br /><br />Modern fixtures and appliances grace this spacious 850-sqft apartment, which was featured in a recent Wall Street Journal article (http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-jackson-heights-a-little-of-everything-1448622001) about Jackson Heights. You&#039;ll find hand-crafted wrought-iron lighting designs by Hubbardton Forge (in Vermont) throughout the space, as well as original hardwood floors in excellent condition, and multiple closets. All windows face west onto 85th Street (overlooking English garden homes) or south towards 35th Avenue. The afternoon light is just spectacular.<br /><br />The roomy entry foyer has two large closets and a set of custom-built floating wall shelves. The foyer gives way to the renovated kitchen on the left, where you&#039;ll find updated stainless steel appliances (including dishwasher), eco-friendly IceStone countertops (http://icestoneusa.com/), a custom-designed wraparound bar area, and plenty of cabinet/drawer space, with under-cabinet lighting.<br /><br />Down the hall from the foyer are the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom is tastefully renovated with Blue Pearl granite flooring and countertop, and a frameless glass shower stall. The bathroom is right across the hall from a double-closet that&#039;s been opened up into a perfect dressing area with its own lighting. The massive (12x18) bedroom has three windows and yet another double closet.<br /><br />To the right of the foyer is the huge living area (12x20), which has another set of floating shelves. Two west-facing windows frame French doors that open out onto the slate-tiled balcony, where you&#039;ll enjoy summer cocktails at sunset.<br /><br />The Carlton House is a pre-war style building which was designed by prominent NYC architect Philip Birnbaum and completed in 1946. The building offers a part-time doorman, private garden area, laundry room, massive 100-car garage (short or no waitlist), and private storage compartments (waitlist).
