				This has likely already been discussed, but I am interested in hearing the group&#039;s thoughts on the Jackson Heights-Corona Business Improvement District.&nbsp; I keep seeing things about it around (previously all positive), but then the latest piece I came across was this video, painting it in a negative light (i.e., opening the gate for big box retailers and kicking out the local businesses).&nbsp; Anyone have thoughts or perspective?&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfCMV5bV7As&nbsp;

				This is fascinating...NYC is such a dynamic city...always changing...from what I&#039;ve heard Jax Hts and Corona have changed incredibly in the last 50 years...(if you watch the Alfred Hitchcock film THE WRONG MAN you&#039;ll catch Jackson Heights in&nbsp; 1956 before it became diverse)... <br /><br />I think part of the awesomeness of living in NYC... is the tension between change... and those who want things to remain as they are. <br /><br />I believe that battle has always been the case...and think it will be forever.<br /><br />What do I think?&nbsp; <br /><br />That we live in a democracy...and everyone will have their say...and that human beings are incredibly resourceful...<br /><br />Personally, I am not fearful of change.&nbsp; It&#039;s why I am in NYC. <br /><br />And the hybrid of what was... influencing what will be...creates something new...and that&#039;s exciting...<br /><br />Resourceful businesses adapt and thrive with time.&nbsp; Already Latino culture has been Americanized, simply by being here in NYC.&nbsp; America has put its stamp on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />But rather than see that as bad thing...I see it as a creative and fascinating hybrid of the old and new.<br /><br />And that will be the future...because it always is...(historically).<br /><br />Culture is not static.&nbsp; And if you try to keep it that way...it atrophies and dies.<br /><br />And NYC culture is the most dynamic on this planet.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				<br />I am for the BID.&nbsp; Junction Blvd. and Roosevelt Ave. get trashed on a daily bases.&nbsp; The individual business owners can&#039;t properly maintain the streets.&nbsp; Junction Blvd. was strewn with garbage each morning when I walked to the train, but now, they have the temporary BID works cleaning Junction Blvd. and it has made a <strong>HUGE</strong> difference.&nbsp; &nbsp;You see the workers in yellow shirts, emptying the overfilling street litter baskets and sweeping the street.&nbsp; I am all for a cleaner Jackson Heights!<br />

				I am also in favor of the BID.&nbsp; I see now the opponents of the plan are getting more press coverage.&nbsp; There&#039;s an article in the Daily News about it. http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/expanded-bid-plan-queens-fire-article-1.1450426<br /><br />It sounds like they&#039;re objecting to clean streets because they are afraid their rents will increase.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they look at it from a different perspective: cleaner, safer streets could bring them more business and they can make more money.

				I can&#039;t believe that any resident would oppose the BID. It&#039;s a win win situation for the people who live here especially for <strong>disasters</strong> like Roosevelt Avenue. It would help eliminate a myriad of illegal activities including sex trafficking, drug sales and prostitution which has had a devastating effect beyond its borders and onto the residential Streets. If I had a business on Roosevelt Avenue I&#039;d be concerned about not only cleaning up the area visually, but getting rid of all the illegal activity as well.

				I also support the creation of a Jackson Heights-Corona BID to boost economic activity and bring more jobs to our area. And protesters&#039; claims that the BID is a ploy to boot out Latinos are, well, hysterical (especially since Councilmember Ferreras, a Dominican, is one of the BID&#039;s main proponents).<br /><br />But the Daily News article does help me understand where these business owners are coming from. They already face exorbitant rents (thanks, absentee landlords) and taxes up the wazoo, not to mention red tape and city fines. The whole point of the BID is to pay for things that the city SHOULD be doing anyway, like street clean-up and graffiti removal. If someone asked me to pay an extra hundred bucks a year for street cleaning, I&#039;d probably be pissed off too.<br /><br />Basically, it sounds like the organizers of the BID haven&#039;t done a good job in selling the idea to local business owners. But we have no way of knowing how representative the protesters are of the 4,000 prospective members. Maybe BID supporters need to organize their own public display.

				I am in favor of the BID, as I am sure most residents are, regardless of whether they live north or south of Roosevelt Avenue, how long they have lived here, and where their families originally came from.&nbsp; We are all in favor of removing illegal activity from Roosevelt Avenue and providing for a clean, safe and pleasant shopping environment.<br /><br />Ultimately it is the property owners who must agree to the BID. They will pay the additional tax to fund the operations of the BID.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these taxes are often shared with their commercial tenants in the form of higher rents.<br /><br />Where, precisely, will big-box retailers locate given the small buildings that tend to line the avenue?&nbsp; And as someone else said, if I were a merchant, I would think that a safer, cleaner, more inviting avenue would attract more business in the long term.&nbsp; That would be worth the extra fees for the BID.&nbsp; Unfortunately many, if not most, of our commercial property owners and merchants have been unable to develop a clear vision for creating an attractive, clean, orderly, safe, and varied commercial district that will serve the needs of the residents of Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, and Corona.&nbsp; With that said, the police, for some reason, seem to be unable to clean up the Avenue.&nbsp; As such, a BID seems the best chance for the improvement of Roosevelt Avenue to occur in our lifetime.

				The battle is that the business owners don&#039;t want the improvements...because improvements may lead to a change of environment...which could attract gentrified businesses...leading to higher rents...which may drive the present business owners out.<br /><br />This has happened to Downtown Brooklyn and in countless other places in NYC...so they have a point.<br /><br />The tension is... between keeping Roosevelt Ave as it is....(crazy and chaotic)... or creating a more upmarket Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />My feeling is that NYC is changing...folks who used to go out to the suburbs in Long Island...are now seeking to remain in the boros...and that tide cannot be stopped...<br /><br />It&#039;s de-suburbanization and re-urbanization...after decades of the suburban dream... now coming to a close.<br /><br />Market forces will prevail...and those little businesses will probably be the victims of &quot;the new urban&quot; pressures.<br /><br />And they can sense it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				new to the forum, but have lived in JH and East Elmhurst for over 30 years. Some great points already discussed in the thread and anyone who has actually lived in JH/East Elmhurst for as long as I have really shouldn&#039;t have objection to a BID. I&#039;m not entirely sure what kind of &quot;character&quot; the opponents refer to, but there are very few, perhaps a handful, that stretch between 82nd and 114th that truly have any character. My personal opinions aside, would anyone know if there plans to be a public forum on this coming up? How do the people in favor of the BID make our voices heard? It&#039;s truly time for change in the neighborhood, especially roosevelt ave and It would be great if we had the opportunity to voice our support for a BID.

				There was a gang murder right on that spot on Septmber 20. (not the infamous kisses stabbing)<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2013-10-02/Front_Page/Murder_Charge_For_Alleged_Gang_Member.html<br /><br />This is where I get on and off the train. I&#039;m not happy.<br /><br /><br />Murder Charge For Alleged Gang Member <br /><br /><br />Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced on September 29 that Pedro Silva, 20, a purported member of the M18 street gang, has been charged with fatally shooting a 33-year-old Corona man beneath the elevated Roosevelt Avenue train tracks in Jackson Heights.<br />Brown said, “In another unfortunate example of the senseless gun violence that seems to more and more permeate our society, the defendant is accused of chasing after the victim with others and fatally shooting him in the head while he was lying helplessly on the ground. His alleged actions were violent and ruthless and the charges against him will be vigorously prosecuted.”<br />The district attorney identified the defendant as Silva, of 33-32 89th St. in&nbsp; Jackson Heights.  Silva, who is presently awaiting arraignment in Queens Criminal Court, is charged with second-degree murder, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and tampering with physical evidence.  If convicted, Silva faces up to 25 years to life in prison. <br />Brown said that, according to the charges, Silva, along with several other gang members, was chasing the victim, Ivan Rodriguez, 33, of Corona, at approximately 6:00 p.m. on September 20.  When Rodriguez fell in front of 89-08 Roosevelt Avenue, Silva shot him, striking him in the head and neck – before fleeing and discarding his weapon in a pile of garbage near 37th Avenue. Thereafter, police allegedly recovered a .22 caliber firearm, five spent rounds and one live round from a pile of garbage located in front of 37-61 88th Street.<br />Rodriguez was transported to a local Queens hospital where he was pronounced dead.<br />

				Only in Jackson Heights would improved safety, cleaniness and small business growth be seen as a negative. <br /><br />Just mind-blowing.<br /><br />The BID, the bad and the ugly<br /><br />&nbsp;by Tess McRae, Associate Editor | Posted: Thursday, October 10, 2013 10:30 am <br /><br />The proposed Jackson Heights-Corona Business Improvement District has been the subject of much controversy since it was announced in February as part of Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras’ (D-East Elmhurst) “New Deal” for Roosevelt Avenue.<br /><br />With rallies and petitions against what the 82nd Street Partnership calls a “small business survival strategy,” supporters of the BID want to set the record straight.<br /><br />“There have been rumors and other things said about the BID and its intentions for the past few months and we want to make sure that the correct information is getting out there,” said Seth Taylor, the executive director of the 82nd Street Partnership, who is also working with a team of business and property owners and others to create the Jackson Heights-Corona BID.<br /><br />“We have plans to improve the area that can only be accomplished if the businesses in the area come together in an organized group,” he continued.<br /><br />Resistance came almost immediately after the BID was proposed as business and property owners, residents and other members of the community claimed creating a BID would gentrify the area, weeding out the culture, restaurants and stores that make the shopping corridor along Roosevelt Avenue special.<br /><br />“Residents find the businesses and surroundings familiar here,” Marty Kirchner, who has passionately worked with the Roosevelt Avenue Community Alliance against the BID proposal. “We’re not against development but this isn’t about development, this is about creating improvements in the interest of property owners and trying to compete with Long Island and Manhattan.”<br /><br />Critics of the BID, including Kirchner, say that creating the group would cause property values to increase, which will result in an increase in rent that business owners may not be able to afford.<br /><br />“This is about creating a cleaner, safer and more inviting commercial corridor that will improve quality of life and promote small business growth,” Taylor said. “It’s a small business survival strategy.”<br /><br />Taylor also said the services to the business corridor can help reduce crime and allow for more events and activities in the plaza areas.<br /><br />In May, a “taste of the BID” — a scaled-down version of the services businesses would receive from the actual BID — was launched. In addition, the proposal has undergone adjustments to accommodate budget concerns.<br /><br />The original Jackson Heights-Corona BID would have run up Roosevelt Avenue from 81st to 114th streets and include parts of Junction Boulevard, requiring a budget of $1.75 million and serving almost 1,100 businesses.<br /><br />Now, the budget has been shaved to $860,000 and the boundaries have shrunk to encompass 850 properties between 104th and 81st streets.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest concern that merchants have raised is the cost each property owner would have to pay. According to the recently updated plans, each would pay about $900, over $1,000 less than the original plan proposed.<br /><br />“When we revisited the plan, we wanted to make sure this plan was viable,” Cheryl Tse, a project consultant said. “Typically these properties house two or three businesses at a time, which reduces the monthly fees by a significant amount. It could be divided among them.<br /><br />“It’s a small investment for something that’s going to bring them a lot of returns.”<br /><br />For now, the decision on the Jackson Heights-Corona BID is in the hands of the city Department of Small Business Services, the agency that oversees all of the BIDs in the city.<br /><br />There is no set date for the decision to be made.<br />

				Actually...exactly the same thing happened in Downtown Brooklyn...the Fulton Street Mall...<br /><br />A clean up of the area led to property prices increasing and higher rents and old time businesses were priced out.<br /><br />Fascinating really...that the choices are either third world conditions meaning cheap rents...or first world conditions meaning expensive rents.&nbsp; NYC really is and probably has always been... parallel worlds...co-existing uneasily.

				Plenty of businesses here have moved out due to the high rents.&nbsp; I still miss Rudy&#039;s Volcano who ended up moving to the Lower East Side of Manhattan because it was far cheaper than what his landlord was charging.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t get that having a BID automatically equals gentrification.&nbsp; Don&#039;t residents deserve safety, clean streets, and less garbage?&nbsp; &nbsp;I find it disappointing that shop-owners are opposed to a BID, but not surprised either.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason I call Roosevelt the red light district.&nbsp; Getting the area cleaned up might be bad for the red light district&#039;s clientele.&nbsp; Never have I seen such a stark contrast in avenues from 34th to Roosevelt.

				This BID is doing everything to accomodate and listen to business owners.&nbsp; They&#039;ve scaled back the area, they&#039;ve scaled back costs, they&#039;ve allowed pooling of costs. There&#039;s free services, such as signage. I should have to pay $900 to have someone consistently clean, adequately light, provide security and promote my business for an entire year. I think some of these guys want the place to stay a grimey barrio. Sorry, no charm in a grimey barrio. A clean, well lit one with some actual charm would be better.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even shop at the Rite Aid on Roosevelt Avenue because the area around 90th is an assault on the senses, not to mention the location of several daytime murders in recent times.<br /><br />It&#039;s maddening.<br />

				commercial rent stabilization would be ideal. i remember that being tossed around when i lived on the Lower East Side in &#039;83-&#039;85....right as all the businesses that had been there for decades were being booted out to &quot;improve&quot; the area. naturally, landlords were able to win that fight, as they do all fights.<br /><br />i don&#039;t object to a BID, but then again, i&#039;m not the one being asked to fund it -- and pay a second time for services (cleaning, lighting, etc) that my business is already being taxed once to pay for.<br /><br />perhaps if local residents eager to see such improvements were willing to pay for half of its cost -- through taxes, donations, whatever -- there&#039;d be more willingness. everyone here willing to pony up to improve the area?

				I think that when you shop at a location, you are &quot;paying&quot; for it. Actually that&#039;s what it is. They factor in the cost of doing business. Maybe they can spread the $900 out over the cost of a year. It would probably come out to a quarter of a cent per customer.<br /><br />We are paying taxes&nbsp; by living here. I don&#039;t understand how paying taxes is going to support the BID, since it is a private organization.<br /><br />It&#039;s $900 a year, which is tax deductible to the business owner. Costs can be pooled. It includes all sort of services including marketing. It&#039;s subsidized.<br /><br />How much more should be done to make this palatable? People should donate money so they can to shop at someone&#039;s store? Maybe I should just pick out a store and send them a monthly check, or just pay the $900 for them.<br /><br />I apologize for losing patience, but if someone is going to do business in NYC, if you need to pass a hat to pay a cost of doing business that is really negibible over the cost of a year AND cost deductible, maybe they need to be doing something else.

				Since all landlords of the commercial property are happy to see the rent go up, it would be natural to ask the commercial landlord to pay the cost. This BID is also going to benefit the resident owners too with an improved environment, so let&#039;s ask coop/condo/house owners, in additional to the commercial landlords, to pay the street cleaning cost. I&#039;m sure that the cost would be very little compared with the property tax, and with much less opposition.&nbsp; It is always that the renters have no stake in improving the environment for long term, what they care is the rent paid each month.<br />

				Your co-op is responsible for keeping the sidewalk and street in front of it&#039;s address clean and safe - you think now they should pay a portion of the BID costs on Roosevelt Avenue?<br /><br />The cost of paying your super or your porter to sweep, or to maintain the integrity of the sidewalk is the co-ops cost of doing business. If the cost goes up, shareholders are assessed. You do not ask a store on Roosevelt Avenue to help you pay it.<br /><br />When you buy something in a store or restaurant, you are paying a portion of the cost of doing business for the owner of the business. If the cost goes up, he/she may have to raise prices, but they don&#039;t&nbsp; (and shouldn&#039;t expect) you to pay it directly.

				I just want to get off the train on Roosevelt Avenue and not want to close my eyes.&nbsp; I want to shop in my neighborhood and not have to go to Sunnyside or LIC, as has been suggested. I work very long hours and sorry, I don&#039;t want to have to walk, take a bus or subway to access the type of retail that every neighborhood should simply have. And even if it can be argued that we have basically everything we need here, there&#039;s not denying that Roosevelt is, well terrible.<br /><br />My husband and I have invested our life savings in JH and have been here more than 7 years. When we heard that efforts were being made to clean up Roosevelt Avenue, it strongly influenced our decision to stay here.<br /><br />This is not a lot to ask, and in a community with the footprint the size of JH, is something we shouldn&#039;t have to struggle so much to achieve. It&#039;s actually absurd that Sunnyside has better retail than JH.<br /><br />I have called the BID to find out what&#039;s happenig, and asked yes, if there&#039;s anything I can do.

				My guess is that many of the businesses along Roosevelt are already successful -- at least by the number of customers you see patronizing various stores/ restaurants, particularly&nbsp; on weekends.&nbsp; It is not really clear to me that these already profitable businesses would gain that much by implementing a BID, in terms of increased foot traffic, cash flow etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also, not really sure how much a BID can realistically accomplish in terms of general aesthetics. I think Roosevelt will always be a bit noisy/gritty as long as the 7 remains an elevated line -- which is likely to be for a very long time to come.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Although it’s a ways before my time, I understand that 3rd Avenue in Manhattan was very gritty up until the 1950s, when the El line was finally demolished.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And while I know this is anathema to many people on this board, Roosevelt has its own urban charms.&nbsp; For many people, the image of an elevated line rattling over a somewhat grimy but very bustling street of bars, stores and eateries is quintessentially New York. Why not just embrace that?&nbsp; <br /><br />Particularly when the rest of Jackson Heights is filled with such architecturally distinguished buildings, tree-lined and tranquil streets, lovely gardens etc. -- and is overall a very pleasant place to live.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				It may be true that there is a lot of foot traffic on Roosevelt Avenue, but many of the businesses are illegal fronts. Prostitution, drugs, and a variety of other illegal activity bring people to the area that would otherwise not be here. If you take a close look, there is nothing &quot;charming &quot; about it. Sex trafficking is not charming. Illegal social security cards is not cute. Selling cocaine and other drugs is not something that creates&nbsp; a &quot;bustling&quot; neighborhood. Sure it brings people to the neighborhood, but for all the wrong reasons. Landlords don&#039;t care either way as long as they are getting high rents.&nbsp; Creating a BID is long over due and makes the people who do business here have a stake in the neighborhood. I&#039;m really disappointed that it has be slashed and wish it could be extended to 74th Street.&nbsp; It is by far the best thing that could happen for Jackson Heights. Legitimate businesses have nothing to loose and everything to gain here.

				On any given Saturday afternoon, there are crowds of people along Roosevelt Ave. and the 82nd Street corridor on either side of Roosevelt.&nbsp; I think that very few of them are there for sex trafficking, cocaine sales or illegal SS cards.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think that the vast majority of these people are patronizing clothing stores, 99 cents stores, appliance stores, restaurants and food stands and the various other businesses which line the avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are issues on Roosevelt, particularly later in the evening -- and sex trafficking is obviously unconscionable. <br /><br />But to broadly characterize the majority of businesses on Roosevelt as illegal &quot;fronts&quot; and the people who patronize them as lowlifes or criminals is highly misleading and creates a false picture of the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Your testimony is proof that something needs to be done to improve the street conditions.<br /><br />We have started an online petition of support on our website, and encourage you and other residents to sign it. You&#039;ll also be able to opt-in to join our mailing list.<br /><br />http://jhcoronabid.org/<br /><br />Our goal is to reach 1,000 from community members like yourself.

				I appreciate what you&#039;re saying except for one thing: if you want cleaner streets, someone must clean them. If you want safer surroundings, yes, cops help, but so does better lighting, and a healthy, frequented retail corrider (not Gentleman&#039;s clubs). <br /><br />No one is saying that the BID can stop people from running red lights. But if I feel better about being on Roosevelt, I might stop into a resturant on my way home to pick up take-out or I might buy some pastries at a bakery. I will not do that now, and I lived on Fordham Road in the Bronx. 1) it&#039;s damn unpleasant and 2) it&#039;s not safe.<br /><br />If you look at the website you can see the progress that is currently being made with the existing merchants, not displaced ones.

				This needs to be seconded because anyone who suggests that Roosevelt is not used by families has never walked along it, especially on the weekend during the day. A great deal of the pedestrian congestion is largely due to the high volume of strollers and slow-moving kids out with their families. <br /><br />Yes, <strong>some</strong> places along Roosevelt are involved with nefarious activities but I do believe these places are in the minority. The avenue does take on a different personality at night, but even then, families are out, shopping and eating. <br /><br />I am all for cleaner, crime-free streets, but for that to happen in a meaningful way, the conversation needs to expand well beyond the parameters of this site and its primary users.

				If the BID is such a win-win, why does it seem to be engendering such stubborn resistance from members of the business community on Roosevelt (most of whom I imagine are fairly shrewd individuals who understand what will and will not benefit their businesses over the long run)?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Are there any merchant groups along Roosevelt who are actually supporting the BID?&nbsp; Do the current patrons of the various stores and restaurants along Roosevelt (which include many families as pointed out above) support the BID? <br /><br />Not meant to be a rhetorical question -- would actually like to know. <br />

				I&#039;m not going to get into a discussion with you on this issue, because I know where that will lead. And this discussion has been had before, so you can go back and look at former posts on the BID, and decide what you believe is true.<br /><br />If you go to the 82d Street BID website, you can find answers to some of your questions regarding support or lack of it.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you object to a BID, don&#039;t support it. If you strongly object to it, stand with the merchants you support.<br /><br />I believe that the BID is not the Koch Bros. and I welcome their efforts to work with the community to yes, clean up Roosevelt Avenue and work with merchants to improve the business corridor. I can&#039;t speak for merchants and I can&#039;t speak for you, but I believe that many JH residents agree with me. Perhaps I&#039;m wrong, but they can decide for themselves.

Sin embargo, según Taylor, la inversión es cerca de $75 al mes por edificio, de modo que si una estructura tiene dos negocios el costo sería de unos $37 por local.<br /><br />http://www.eldiariony.com/queens-inaugura-nueva-plaza-comunitaria-avenida-roosevelt

				That&#039;s the spirit!

				in all honesty, I wouldn&#039;t object to the Sydney (or Denver) inspired airport relocation -- although i&#039;m guessing that the handful of people who work there might feel differently.<br /><br />but, and here&#039;s where I become Cruella DeVille again, if we move the airport, where does it go? breezy point? flatlands? seriously, it&#039;s become an anachronism and can&#039;t grow where it is. and every neighborhood in its proximity is on edge because of that. so, what do we do?&nbsp; let&#039;s consider the possibility of a relocated regional/non-international airport for new York. where can it go, anywhere remotely near NYC?<br /><br />Formosa?

				Great article by Senator Peralta.&nbsp; And reading the related article about the resistance to improving our neighborhood is absolutely baffling.&nbsp; Terraza 7 is actually one of the greatest things about our neighborhood--a great bar with great music and unlike any other bar in the city.&nbsp; But to hear the bar&#039;s owner complain that improving the neighborhood will rid Jackson Heights and Elmhurst of its diversity is so wrong.&nbsp; There&#039;s no need to protect sex trafficking and gang wars and making an effort to shift away from that paradigm will not turn us into Williamsburg overnight.&nbsp; And the caption below a picture of the fabulous Cositas Ricas, bemoaning that a BID expansion would cause the restaurant to disappear is crazy.&nbsp; Cositas Ricas is packed almost 24 hours a day.&nbsp; Terraza 7 is bustling most nights.&nbsp; I just came back from Unidentified Flying Chickens, a great place that has seriously upped their game and they&#039;re doing great business.&nbsp; These places won&#039;t go away.&nbsp; Neither will Ayada, Phayul, Table Wine, Ricos Tintos and other great local establishments that do what they do really well and are rewarded with loyal customers.&nbsp; But a little less of hanging on to the pride of being (as Senator Peralta suggests) the heir apparent to the 80&#039;s version of Times Square?&nbsp; That is a loss I would hardly bemoan.

				If you take a look at the activities and services already planned by the BID, it&#039;s cleared that it&#039;s all designed to support the existing merchant population as well as making it friendly for all. Keeping Roosevelt Avenue a dump makes it a great location for the negative influences you mentioned.

				Actually yes.<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2013-10-02/Front_Page/Murder_Charge_For_Alleged_Gang_Member.html<br /><br />Murder Charge For Alleged Gang Member <br /><br />Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced on September 29 that Pedro Silva, 20, a purported member of the M18 street gang, has been charged with fatally shooting a 33-year-old Corona man beneath the elevated Roosevelt Avenue train tracks in Jackson Heights.<br />Brown said, “In another unfortunate example of the senseless gun violence that seems to more and more permeate our society, the defendant is accused of chasing after the victim with others and fatally shooting him in the head while he was lying helplessly on the ground. His alleged actions were violent and ruthless and the charges against him will be vigorously prosecuted.”<br />The district attorney identified the defendant as Silva, of 33-32 89th St. in&nbsp; Jackson Heights.  Silva, who is presently awaiting arraignment in Queens Criminal Court, is charged with second-degree murder, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and tampering with physical evidence.  If convicted, Silva faces up to 25 years to life in prison. <br />Brown said that, according to the charges, Silva, along with several other gang members, was chasing the victim, Ivan Rodriguez, 33, of Corona, at approximately 6:00 p.m. on September 20.  When Rodriguez fell in front of 89-08 Roosevelt Avenue, Silva shot him, striking him in the head and neck – before fleeing and discarding his weapon in a pile of garbage near 37th Avenue. Thereafter, police allegedly recovered a .22 caliber firearm, five spent rounds and one live round from a pile of garbage located in front of 37-61 88th Street.<br />Rodriguez was transported to a local Queens hospital where he was pronounced dead.<br />

				Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District: Investing in a Sustainable Future<br /><br />November 6, 2013<br />&nbsp;<br />By Seth Taylor<br />&nbsp;<br />As readers of Queens Latino know, the proposal to form the new Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District has sparked discussion and debate in the community about the future of the neighborhood’s commercial corridors, in particular Roosevelt Avenue. Ultimately, this dialogue has produced a thoughtful neighborhood-based plan that will work to strengthen and grow the district’s greatest assets—its entrepreneurial, diverse, and immigrant-owned businesses.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />With a mission to improve neighborhood quality of life and promote small business growth by creating cleaner, safer, and more inviting commercial corridors, the Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District offers an inclusive bottom-up solution to help kick-start and sustain the regeneration that so many Roosevelt Avenue and Junction Boulevard stakeholders want to see happen.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Support is widespread and broad-based, and it is growing by the day. Even individuals who just weeks ago were protesting the plan have now signed on as supporters. By taking a closer look at the proposal—its cost, services, governance and goals—stakeholders see this as a great opportunity to organize and invest in the neighborhood’s future.<br />&nbsp;<br />In recent weeks, support for the proposal to form the new Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District has increased significantly. As of today, hundreds of small business owners, residents, property owners, civic and community members have pledged support for the formation of what will be one of New York City’s most vital and diverse business improvement districts. <br />&nbsp;<br />Like all 68 business improvement districts in New York City, the new Jackson Heights – Corona one will be funded by property owners and commercial tenants making annual contributions based on a fair formula that factors building foot frontage and property value. In this case, the majority of property owners will be charged on average about $75 per month, which equals roughly $2.50 a day.&nbsp; The property owners and commercial tenants typically negotiate on their terms how the assessment is split. This is a small investment that will bring tangible returns.<br />&nbsp;<br />With a budget of about $860,000 per year—raised by property owners and commercial tenants, and collected by the Department of Finance—the Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District will fund special services that go above and beyond what the city provides, including daily sidewalk sweeping and graffiti removal, holiday lights, cultural events, shopping guides, landscaping and streetscape beautification. As an organization made up of nearly 1,000 businesses, the Jackson Heights – Corona Business Improvement District will be a strong and effective advocate for the neighborhood.<br />&nbsp;<br />A board of directors composed of property owners, commercial tenants, residents, community board members, street vendors, and representatives from city government, including the Mayor, Comptroller, Borough President and City Council member, will govern the organization.&nbsp; The board of directors will be a diverse and representative body, voted in by the membership of the business improvement district: every business, resident, and property owner located within the boundaries has a vote.<br />&nbsp;<br />To understand the impact a business improvement district has on a neighborhood, we can look to 82nd Street, where property owners and commercial tenants have been making an annual investment for nearly a quarter century.&nbsp; With beautiful street trees, ample bicycle parking, outdoor seating, a community garden, clean sidewalks, and attractive storefronts, shoppers come to 82nd Street to enjoy the vibrant retail mix and pleasant atmosphere. <br />&nbsp;<br />By making 82nd Street inviting to local shoppers, and by providing direct assistance to small business owners, the commercial corridor is given the opportunity to thrive and grow. <br />&nbsp;<br />That is why nearly 75% of the ground floor businesses located in the 82nd Street business improvement district are still independently owned and operated, many by immigrant families.<br />&nbsp;<br />As one of 82nd Street’s business owners, Araceli Bastida of Sonrisas Sanas, says about the improvement district, “It feels good to know that there’s somebody taking care of the community, freeing us to focus on growing our business.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Now is the time to give the same opportunity to the hundreds of business owners on Roosevelt Avenue and Junction Boulevard in Jackson Heights and Corona.&nbsp; Together we can create a successful and sustainable local economy for generations to come.<br />&nbsp;<br />________________________________________<br /><br />About the Jackson Heights - Corona Business Improvement District: The proposed Jackson Heights - Corona Business Improvement District will strengthen our diverse small business community. With the support of the district&#039;s property owners, business owners, entrepreneurs, elected council member, community boards, community-based organizations, as well as residents, the proposed Jackson Heights - Corona Business Improvement District will create a cleaner, safer, and more pleasant place for everyone to enjoy.<br /><br />www.CleanerSaferRoosevelt.org<br /><br />www.CleanerSaferJunction.org<br />

				How do folks feel about the news signs? I personally am not a fan, but do respect that the intention is to comply with our neighborhood&#039;s landmark status. What really bothers me, however, is that the $50,000 grant (not sure about the source of the other $150,000) that was used to change these private businesses&#039; signs were taxpayer dollars as the grant came from the City. It seems to me that there are more important things on 82nd Street and/or Roosevelt Avenue that could have been addressed with those dollars: security, even more lighting, even more garbage pick-ups, an anti-littering campaign, you name it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/24283173/article-Historic-storefronts-on-82nd-St--get-a-makeover<br /><br />Historic storefronts on 82nd St. get a makeover<br /><br />by Andrew Shilling<br />12.24.13 - 09:20 am<br /><br />Businesses on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights recently received grant money from the city to further their beautification initiative.<br /><br />The Storefront Restoration Grant Program is an initiative led by the 82nd Street Partnership. Last week, seven ground floor storefronts and three upper floor facades between 37th and Roosevelt avenues took advantage of nearly $200,000 in grant funding for a much-needed makeover.<br /><br />&quot;The 82nd Street Partnership&#039;s Storefront Restoration Grant Program is one of many ways we work to improve quality of life in the Jackson Heights business improvement district,” said Seth Taylor, executive director of the 82nd Street Partnership.<br /><br />Through the $50,000 Neighborhood Challenge, three businesses were able to remove nearly 20 Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) violations and work towards expanding their customer base. <br /><br />“By restoring older storefronts with new signs, windows, lights, and awnings, we&#039;re making shops more attractive and inviting, which ultimately helps our mom-and-pop merchants retain and expand their customer base,” Taylor said. “Ultimately, the goal of this program is to help preserve retail diversity and enhance the neighborhood&#039;s architecture and sense of place.&quot;<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras congratulated Taylor and the 82nd Street Partnership last week on the improvements.<br /><br />“With this award, a new milestone is marked not only for our deserving local businesses, but also for the 82nd Street Partnership, who have been committed to enhancing the quality of life for our community,” Ferreras said. “Through our joint collaboration, I am confident that the quality of life for everyone in our community will only continue to improve.”

				The grant was from the Storefront Restoration Grant Program, thus the money was earmarked for that purpose.<br /><br />If you look at the research, storefront restoration is a an important part of urban renewal, something very much needed in our community.<br /><br />https://www.google.com/search?q=Storefront+Restoration+Grant+Program&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address&amp;ie=&amp;oe=#q=Storefront+Restoration+Grant+Programs&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-Address<br /><br />The 82nd street Partnership addresses all of the complaints you list, this is just ONE of their initiatives.

				The BID does seem to address my list and more so far, and I truly wish them all the best as their success would translate to the community&#039;s success. All I am saying is that the grant could have been earmarked for whatever the BID chose (the BID did the earmarking not the grant from what I understand) and as a taxpayer, I would have liked to see my dollars go to something of more importance, but thanks for the link to a Google search. What do others think?

				I think as you said, the grant money addresses all those issues you mentioned, whether directly or indirectly.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do feel that we are not responsible&nbsp; for&nbsp; subsidizing the&nbsp; store owners who willing did not comply with landmarks. It has been my personal experience that many owners knowingly ignored landmarks regulations. Despite this, it appears to be a win- win situation for Jackson Heights residents as the aesthetics have drastically improved, the area is brighter and less claustrophobic. and as a result &quot;appears&quot; cleaner. I wish they continue this the whole length of Roosevelt and on parts of 37th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;

What really bothers me, however, is that the $50,000 grant (not sure about the source of the other $150,000) that was used to change these private businesses&#039; signs were taxpayer dollars as the grant came from the City. It seems to me that there are more important things on 82nd Street and/or Roosevelt Avenue that could have been addressed with those dollars: security, even more lighting, even more garbage pick-ups, an anti-littering campaign, you name it. <br /><br /><br /><br />http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/24283173/article-Historic-storefronts-on-82nd-St--get-a-makeover<br /><br />Historic storefronts on 82nd St. get a makeover<br /><br />by Andrew Shilling<br />12.24.13 - 09:20 am<br /><br />Businesses on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights recently received grant money from the city to further their beautification initiative.<br /><br />The Storefront Restoration Grant Program is an initiative led by the 82nd Street Partnership. Last week, seven ground floor storefronts and three upper floor facades between 37th and Roosevelt avenues took advantage of nearly $200,000 in grant funding for a much-needed makeover.<br /><br />&quot;The 82nd Street Partnership&#039;s Storefront Restoration Grant Program is one of many ways we work to improve quality of life in the Jackson Heights business improvement district,” said Seth Taylor, executive director of the 82nd Street Partnership.<br /><br />Through the $50,000 Neighborhood Challenge, three businesses were able to remove nearly 20 Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) violations and work towards expanding their customer base. <br /><br />“By restoring older storefronts with new signs, windows, lights, and awnings, we&#039;re making shops more attractive and inviting, which ultimately helps our mom-and-pop merchants retain and expand their customer base,” Taylor said. “Ultimately, the goal of this program is to help preserve retail diversity and enhance the neighborhood&#039;s architecture and sense of place.&quot;<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras congratulated Taylor and the 82nd Street Partnership last week on the improvements.<br /><br />“With this award, a new milestone is marked not only for our deserving local businesses, but also for the 82nd Street Partnership, who have been committed to enhancing the quality of life for our community,” Ferreras said. “Through our joint collaboration, I am confident that the quality of life for everyone in our community will only continue to improve.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I know this is an older thread, but if I&#039;m reading it correctly, the current configuration of the BID includes Corona?&nbsp; I&#039;m not understanding why that is. I&#039;m sure the residents of Corona want nicer storefronts and all that too, but honestly, the clientele, incomes and needs in Jackson Heights and Corona are very different. I would think the Jackson Heights BID would focus on 37th and Roosevelt Avenues between 88th Street and 74th Street (give or take either way) and 82nd Street from Roosevelt to 37th Avenue. I like the uniform signage and awnings that a lot of the stores have now and that so many stores &quot;adopt&quot; the trees and plant flowers. Personally, I would like more of that in the historic district. If the historic district gets expanded, then the BID can worry about those areas, but for now, for my money, I would think it would be smarter to focus on these areas first. Anyone know why Corona and western JH is included in the BID?

				Unless there has been an update, I think the BID still only covers 82nd. There is a proposal to expand it from 82nd Street into Corona, however there is some opposition to this plan. I&#039;m not sure where things currently stand. <br /><br />My guess as to why that particular area is proposed to be covered is because it falls in Julissa Ferreras city council district, the other area that you described falls in Danny Dromm&#039;s district.<br /><br />Ferreras&#039; district: http://council.nyc.gov/d21/html/members/map.shtml (http://council.nyc.gov/d21/html/members/map.shtml)<br /><br />This is just a guess on my part, I don&#039;t know all of the details.

But it doesn&#039;t say higher commercial rents, at least not in this quote.&nbsp; But I do agree that commerical rents are ridiculous in this neighborhood.&nbsp; However if investors were attracted by the prospect of a clean, safe and&nbsp; sustainable neighborhood where property values would increase, they might purchase commercial property in JH, and break the monopoly of commercial landlords that holds this community in retail commerical rent bondage.&nbsp; Just a thought.

				For those worried the 82nd St. BID will cause commercial rents to rise, you might be relieved by the findings of this 2007 report from the Furman Center, which found that smaller BIDs made up primarily of retail spaces had little impact. (Bigger BIDs made up of office buildings did have an positive impact on property values, probably because those groups have a lot more money to spend.)<br /><br />http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/ImpactofBIDcombined_000_1_1.pdf<br /><br />In any case, I have never seen a clear case made for why commercial rents in our area of Queens are so outrageously high.

				<br />Corinne Lestch was able to get a fake ID on Roosevelt Ave. in Queens.<br /><br /><br />It took me just an hour and a half to get a fake ID in New York City’s ground zero for the fraudulent document business — Roosevelt Ave. in Queens.<br /><br />The Jackson Heights neighborhood is the epicenter of fake paper mills — rackets that fuel teenage drinking and identity theft and also create fake green cards and passports that can pose a serious security threat.<br /><br />At first I was laughed at for looking like a cop. But when I swapped my leather jacket for a red hoodie, a guy carrying boxes was quick to call a friend who could help me out.<br /><br />“You need a fake ID?” the man asked. While several cops roamed the gritty avenue, he led me into an electronics store to get my picture taken for $10.<br /><br />I wrote down my information on a piece of paper, and then he told me the phony card would be ready in an hour. He took $100 from me and slipped away.<br /><br />After 90 minutes, I was led into a narrow staircase in a seedy storefront where we made the exchange — my new fake ID in return for another $50.<br /><br />I didn’t get a new high-tech driver’s license — those are much harder to reproduce — but the market for current licenses, which are still valid if they are issued before September 2013, is skyrocketing.<br /><br />Law enforcement officials are worried that legislation in the City Council to create municipal ID cards for the undocumented would allow for more shady transactions to take place.<br /><br />Council members and the de Blasio administration are still hammering out details of the bill, expected to be the subject of upcoming hearings. But Police Commissioner Bill Bratton expressed concern about the security implications of the program at an April 30 City Council hearing.<br /><br />The new license hasn’t made a dent in the counterfeit market.<br /><br />State Sen. Jose Peralta (D-Queens), whose district includes the Roosevelt Ave. area, is reintroducing legislation to crack down on the flourishing illegal industry.<br /><br />“Sales of fake IDs are thriving,” said Peralta, who wants to raise document forgery from a Class D to a Class C felony.<br /><br />City and state authorities lauded the rollout last September of the new licenses — polycarbonate cards that toned down color and enhanced security — saying they would be much more difficult to forge.<br /><br />But Peralta said the fraudsters are undaunted. “The new license hasn’t made a dent in the counterfeit market,” he said.<br /><br />Peralta introduced his bill, which doubles jail time for offenders caught selling the fake documents, in 2012, but it died in the Assembly. “If you crack down on the mills and increase penalties on these mill operators, it will put these guys out of business,” he said.<br /><br />According to figures from the Queens district attorney’s office, there have already been 130 arrests this year in the borough for creating or possessing fraudulent documents, which include green cards, Social Security cards and passports.<br /><br />Last year, there were 250 collars, and in 2012 there were 273, according to the DA’s office.<br /><br />Identity theft is also a problem — there were 262 people charged with the crime in 2012, and 260 charged in 2013.<br /><br />So far this year, 110 people in Queens have been charged.<br /><br />Law enforcement sources said fraudulent document mills can be highly mobile and adaptable.<br /><br />“A mill is a laptop computer with a printer and a laminator,” a source said. “It can move from one apartment to another apartment, from the back of a store to a basement.”<br /><br />The source added that harsher penalties — for example, doubling jail time to 51/2 years from 21/2 years — would curtail the onslaught of illegal activity on Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />“The penalties for white-collar crimes in New York State are appallingly low,” said the source.<br /><br />clestch@nydailynews.com<br /><br />

				FYI<br /><br />The paperwork be circulated to the business owners are Letters of Support, if a business owner signs it, they support the BID, if they do not, they are not in support.<br /><br />As seen in the video, there is not a &quot;NO&quot; vote, that is because the process set forth by NYC only solicits Letters of Support, and there must be a certain percentage of &quot;supporters&quot; to make an application for a BID extension.

				Thanks erospolitico. I&#039;m sorry to say that you are misinformed about the process. Although the 82nd Street Partnership decided to call their ballots &quot;Letters of Support&quot; there is indeed a box on the ballot to vote NO. I have a copy of the ballot which I would be happy to show you. In my own conversations with the Department of Small Business Services (SBS), if someone does not vote, that will not be interpreted to mean that they do not support the BID. Only if someone is allowed to check the NO box on the ballot will their vote be counted as not in support. In fact, one of the ways that SBS will count the votes is to look at what percentage of the people who voted where in favor of the BID. If only YES votes are taken, that creates a distorted image of overwhelming support. Also, SBS does not specify what percentage of the stakeholders actually need to vote before they decide whether or not to approve the expansion. Regardless of how the ballots will be counted, the fact that the 82nd Street Partnership is going around pressuring immigrant business owners to vote in favor of the BID expansion is evidence of a deeply flawed process of gauging support.

If 82 st partnership then, yes you&#039;re right, this is nondemocratic and should be banned..<br /><br />If&nbsp; someone else then that someone else should avertise the democratic process to the business owners. If someone objects to the BID they should go round the businesses explaining to them that they can vote no at this and this date/location/method?<br /><br />Welcome to democracy, marketplace of ideas etc. If a group is an advocacy group, you can&#039;t expect them to advocate against their own position.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Not only does the 82nd Street Partnership collect the ballots, they decide when to send them out, what the ballots say on them, and how long people have to send them back in. Business owners, property owners, residents, and supporters along Roosevelt Avenue are reaching out to every BID stakeholder to explain the consequences of a BID and that all stakeholders have a right to vote. This is an epic task, however, as there are over 800 businesses and 500 property lots within the proposed BID boundaries. The 82nd Street Partnership has quite a bit more resources at its disposal, and the support of the large real estate companies and corporate business interests that are pushing the BID expansion. If anyone would like to help out to inform stakeholders about their right to vote NO, please respond to this email thread and I can put you in contact with some of the business owners and residents who are leading this effort.

				I am not a stakeholder in the BID so getting a look at the Letter of Support was not an easy task.<br /><br />After examining the Letter of Support, I do see the NO option.<br /><br />There is perfectly no reason why those who have a &quot;vote&quot; in this process are not made aware of their options.<br /><br />In terms of process, the BID manual put out by the NYC SBS gives the organizers the ability to conduct the process in the manner that is being done, I agree it is a very Pro-BID procedure.<br /><br />All I can say is that anyone who has an opinion, to let it be heard at the Public Meetings that the BID will be having on 7/24, and to speak up during the different steps of the impending ULURP process.<br /><br />I would certainly not want to see anyone silenced, and/or forbidden to give an opinion.<br /><br />I do not currently have an opinion, but would not want to see anyone being prevented from giving theirs.

				Unfortunately it left out how the $500,000 donation came to be:<br /><br />&quot;When Kirchner questioned the BID taking a $500,000 donation from the Queens Development Group, the group working on the Willets Point revitalization, Taylor said that was brokered by Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-East Elmhurst).<br /><br />That was confirmed by a Ferreras spokeswoman, who pointed to a bullet point in a press release from last October.<br /><br />“QDG will provide $500,000 to support business along the Roosevelt Avenue Commercial Corridor,” it said.<br /><br />“It was part of the Community Benefits negotiations prior to the Willets Point vote that was approved by the City Council,” the spokeswoman said.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2014/22/jaxheightsdebate_tl_2014_05_30_q.html (http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2014/22/jaxheightsdebate_tl_2014_05_30_q.html)<br /><br />If Ferreras hadn&#039;t asked for this, the money would not have been offered to the BID.<br /><br />I am against the mall being built in Flushing Park, however I do think it is good that Ferreras has been negotiating for donations to Flushing Park and the surrounding communities - I just don&#039;t think the donations are large enough compared to what is proposed to be built.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I wanted to let folks know about two important events that are happening this Thursday, July 24. As part of the Business Improvement District&#039;s (BID) formation process, the 82nd Street Partnership is required to hold two meetings presenting their final district plan. The public is allowed to attend and make comments, but people who wish to speak will be given only 3 minutes and must sign up before the meeting starts. This is the only opportunity that stakeholders and community members have to voice their opinion about the BID. http://jhcoronabid.org/2014/07/09/public-meeting-notice/<br /><br />Public Meeting 1<br /><br />When: Thursday, July 24th, 8:30am to 10:30am<br />Where: Aliento de Vida, 103-12 Roosevelt Avenue<br /><br />Public Meeting 2<br /><br />When: Thursday, July 24th, 6:30pm to 8:30pm<br />Where: Sabor Latino Restaurant, 95-35 40th Road

				Hi, so I&#039;m newish to this forum. I found it a few weeks ago and so far have been a silent observer. This is my first post. I <em>also</em> recently heard about the BID (about a month or so ago). I was aware of some contentiousness around it, but wasn&#039;t entirely sure why so I decided to go to the meeting this evening after seeing someone&#039;s post about it on here (and then the Daily News article, which reminded me). I&#039;m not a stakeholder in it - I live on 75th &amp; 35th at the Clermont, so I&#039;m outside the target area, but close enough that it will affect me (my husband and I are renters who hope to eventually buy in the area).<br /><br />I will say that before going to the meeting, I was mostly undecided slightly in favor of the BID. It seemed like a generally good idea. Having gone to the meeting, I heard a lot of valid concerns, none of which were addressed by the promoters. <br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>The number one concern is that the BID will cause property taxes, commercial, and then residential rents to go up, leading to the disenfranchisement of the lower-income immigrants who&#039;ve been living in Jackson Heights and Corona for a very long time. The view is that this is a good thing for property owners, who can get higher paying tenants, but not for the people in the community who are going to be priced out. <strong>It&#039;s basically the gentrification argument</strong> and I think it&#039;s valid. Dr. Sanchez did get up and speak against the BID making these general points (but not mentioning the alleged scuffle with Seth Taylor) and I thought the points were well-stated and valid. I also think the fact that he was an urban planner, has a PhD in it, and <em>taught</em> urban planning at Cornell does count for something. (I also didn&#039;t realize that he was the person who&#039;d had the scuffle with Mr. Taylor until we got home and my husband clarified for me.) Apparently he&#039;s also a member of community board 3, which is mine (and probably a lot of other people&#039;s as well).&nbsp; Another member of community board 3 (I think), Jessica Ramos (I think), spoke pretty eloquently, making similar points. The woman&#039;s name was Jessica, and described herself as an elected official of some sort. Her speech was pre-written and I&#039;d encourage people to reach out to her to ask what she said... assuming I&#039;ve got the right person. Anyway, I thought she made the best speech with the best points.</li><li><strong>The problems that the BID aims to solve are things that are the city&#039;s responsibility anyway; it just hasn&#039;t been addressing them.</strong> The BID promoters talk about things like cleanliness and lighting and safety - all responsibilities of the city. That&#039;s what we pay taxes for. A lot of the existing problems could (and should!) be addressed by the city, but are being ignored. I&#039;m hoping that the people organizing against the BID will stay organized to push the city on these things if they do succeed. The JHBG has done some stuff like this (tree guards, etc.) without presenting the types of risks that people fear from the BID.</li><li><strong>The BID&#039;s steering committee does not adequately represent members of the community.</strong> I can&#039;t judge the veracity of this particular point. I&#039;m not terribly familiar with who&#039;s who in the area. There were also some concerns about a lack of transparency by the proponents that seemed to be part of not feeling well-represented.</li></ul><br />Overall, I noticed that <em>very few</em> people who were in favor of the BID came to the meeting and spoke and I think that says something. Out of around 15-ish people who spoke, there were only about 3 or 4 (not counting Seth Taylor) who spoke in favor of the BID. Most of the people who spoke in favor thought we should do <em>something</em> to solve the issues that the BID is aiming to solve and we might as well give it a shot. I didn&#039;t find that argument particularly convincing, but they did seem sincere. The crowd was pretty rude to the folks speaking in favor of the BID, which I didn&#039;t appreciate.<br /><br />On the thing with Dr. Sanchez... the editor of Queens Latino did get up and speak about it toward the end, but he just wanted to make a speech about getting Seth Taylor to resign - he didn&#039;t talk about the BID at all. I don&#039;t know if the claims are true or not, but it sounds like a completely personal beef. The Queens Neighborhood United people passed along Sanchez&#039; first piece about the BID (from Feb.) and also passed out the editorial they put out on the 4th of July. If you read that editorial, you basically heard the editor&#039;s speech. (I do think people generally agreed with his assertion that Seth Taylor is disrespectful of the Hispanic community, but that sense seemed to come from the fact that he&#039;s pushing for the BID expansion which they feel is a threat.)&nbsp; They also passed out some points against the BID that seemed overly sensationalistic and badly written.<br /><br />My overall takeaway is that, yes, there are some obvious problems on Roosevelt that need to be addressed, but a BID is not necessarily the best tool for addressing them. The only somewhat unique service I heard the BID provides is helping business owners, etc. deal with city bureaucracy. That doesn&#039;t seem to me to be worth it. If it offered some type of protections for small business owners to keep them from being priced out of the area that they&#039;ve paid extra to help improve, it would be a good thing, but it doesn&#039;t offer that type of protection, and doesn&#039;t have the <em>ability</em> to offer it.<br /><br />If anyone else was at either meeting and has anything to add, I&#039;d like to hear their take.&nbsp; My husband and I have only been in Jackson Heights for about a year and a half, so I&#039;m sure there&#039;s history we&#039;re not familiar with.&nbsp; We certainly weren&#039;t around before the 82nd Street BID came into being, and I&#039;d guess that a lot of people can speak to what that area was like before and after.<br /><br />--Jennifer Cabrera<br /><br />P.S. - Sorry for the length!

				Jenni_squirrel, welcome to JH Life, and thank you very much for the detailed description of the meeting!<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t at the meeting, but I&#039;d just like to add that there&#039;s a lot more here than meets the eye.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reasonable people can certainly disagree on the merits of the BID.&nbsp; But at a meeting like this, the opponents are a lot more motivated to show up than the supporters, so I wouldn&#039;t take the sentiments of the crowd as necessarily representative.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, some of the loudest voices opposing the BID are operating under a misleading name and are really organized from outside Queens.<br /><br />But the thing that irritates me most about this whole debate is the use of the word &quot;gentrification&quot; as a rhetorical cudgel to silence opponents.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this particular neighborhood, the people who are doing it do not have the facts or evidence on their side.&nbsp; Again, reasonable people may disagree about the BID, but many BID supporters are longstanding members of this community with deep roots here and who care about safety and the quality of life on Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of what you&#039;re seeing is outsiders coming here for political reasons and tagging local pro-BID supporters as part of a secretive outside force for gentrification.&nbsp; And pretenders claiming to speak for immigrants to advance their own agendas.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				thank you for the report, which was really descriptive (and well written). felt like I was actually a fly on the wall.<br /><br />as to your points, todd, I think most people use &#039;gentrification&#039; here as a shorthand way of telescoping many concerns -- the displacement of longtime commercial tenants chief among them. one of the items BID proponents uses to push its agenda is &quot;bringing more shoppers to Roosevelt&quot; and &quot;making it more attractive for people to shop/walk.&quot; Well, i&#039;m on Roosevelt several times a week, including just about every weekend. there are shoppers everywhere, stores and eateries are crowded and there are very, very few empty storefronts (which is not the case on 37th, at least the last). <br /><br />there&#039;s a subtext to the &quot;bringing more shoppers&quot; argument, to my ears at least. not &quot;more&quot; shoppers, but &quot;a different kind&quot; of shopper -- one that doesn&#039;t want to shop with the current tenants, and wants them out.<br /><br />and while I agree that &quot;many BID supporters are longstanding members of this community with deep roots here and who care about safety and the quality of life on Roosevelt Avenue,&quot; the same thing can be said for many BID opponents.

				dssjh, You&#039;re absolutely right.&nbsp; Roosevelt west of 82nd Street is a thriving commercial district as it is, and I share your dismay at some of&nbsp; what the BID proponents are saying (including some cringe-worthy comments by some elected officials).&nbsp; But they&#039;re also trying to articulate arguments that they think will appeal to the people who will be doing the voting.&nbsp; So there may be a gap between whatever vision they&#039;re articulating and the change they&#039;re actually likely to achieve.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the real world, they can bring safety and sanitation improvements to Roosevelt Avenue, but as long as the elevated tracks remain, they will never transform it into Forest Hills, Williamsburg, or some kind of suburban shopping paradise.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t mean to discount the claims of bad behavior on the part of BID proponents.&nbsp; But these have been well reported, and I haven&#039;t seen anybody calling out the deceptions of the anti-BID campaign.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Daily News and others continue to take them at face value.<br /><br />I spend a lot more time in the western part of the neighborhood, and would strongly like to see a BID for 74th Street and the surrounding area.&nbsp; Based on my decade plus in the immediate neighborhood, I think that area badly needs it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know enough about the issues in the proposed JH-Corona BID to have a very informed opinion there.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I&#039;m very interested to see how the vote turns out.&nbsp; <br />

				Thanks for the welcome and the compliments!<br /><br />I&#039;ll just say that one thing I noticed at the meeting is that the overwhelming majority of the people there - on both sides of the argument - were longtime residents of the area.<br /><br />To dssjh&#039;s point about &quot;the more shoppers&quot; argument, there was definitely an understanding of that subtext. A lot of the people who spoke kept making the point that there <em>are</em> always tons of people around Roosevelt, just not &quot;the right&quot; people.<br /><br />Also, I didn&#039;t actually hear the word gentrification used very much - people mostly described the effects gentrification that they didn&#039;t want to see. Rents and property taxes going up, the immigrant communities being pushed out (via pricing out), big box stores taking over... I used the word gentrification to sum it up. Because that&#039;s what it is.

				i can&#039;t speak to Make the Road&#039;s position -- perhaps someone involved with the group would be willing to do so on this forum -- but Jenni_Squirrel&#039;s note that &quot;A lot of the people who spoke kept making the point that there are always tons of people around Roosevelt, just not &quot;the right&quot; people.&quot; makes me think there might be some pretty deep opposition.

				I&#039;m involved with the 82 BID in some things, so I am very conscious that what I say may not be objective, but I do want to comment on some things while not being a flag holder for either side....<br /><br /><br />First, I am concerned that they are demonizing Seth because of race. Seth does an awesome job at 82nd street with dealing with all the bureaucracies and getting grants and work done in the area - you really couldn&#039;t find a better BID director. I am concerned that in order to make it work down the line, they might pacify the detractors by getting someone with a better name for the area, but at the cost of quality. I am concerned that the detractors are encouraging the public into thinking that he doesn&#039;t understand the neighborhood and evidencing that by his first and last name. It&#039;s a sad thing. <br /><br /><br />I do think that the detractors lose credibility because while some things have valid points, other things are on the level of conspiracy theories. <br /><br /><br />Also, it is crazy that people are damning even precious Viva la Comida just because it&#039;s attached to the BID. I try to be conscious of my relationships and have a level head about it, but I get so incensed when I hear that people are saying that the trucks from Viva la Comida were all from &quot;Brooklyn&quot;... People talk and spread rumors yet the truth is very easy to google. It&#039;s like all of a sudden, anything associated with the BID is done for the sake of evil. Viva is such a local economy event with a lot of good attention from the city as a whole, I don&#039;t know how anyone can complain. Sorry, just a gripe from others that I take personally. <br /><br /><br />It would be amazing if a community group can do the same job as the BID, but the truth is it&#039;s a lot of work! It would be great if civilians did the community work and advocacy all the time, but the reality is all have jobs and many other responsibilities. <br /><br /><br />The gentrification argument is tough. Gentrification will happen with any good PR for the neighborhood, so does the neighborhood want to exist in a cocoon? Any outsider that appreciates the area will be contributing to higher rents across the board in the long run, so is that bad? If anyone has a solution (and don&#039;t tell me &quot;affordable housing&quot;), please let the entire city know...

				Please read this recent article, written by Javier Castaño, director and editor of QueensLatino.com, about the BID&#039;s July 24th public hearings. The article was just translated and featured on the CUNY School of Journalism&#039;s website Voices of New York: http://www.voicesofny.org/2014/07/tempers-flare-over-roosevelt-avenue-bid/<br /><br />Also, this recent article from Dr. Arturo Ignacio Sánchez, a longtime Jackson Heights resident and professor of urban planning, may help to shed some light on Seth Taylor&#039;s disrespectful attitude toward members of the Latino community in Queens: http://www.queenslatino.com/roosevelt-ave-bid-undemocratic-process/

				Perhaps true, perhaps not, but both are opinion pieces.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve met Mr. Taylor and attended some events on 90th Street, and I can&#039;t imagine the characterization.&nbsp; If anything I think Mr. Taylor is probably sick of being cast as some kind of gentrifying devil, as there seems to be a campaign of character assasination being waged.&nbsp; But Mr. Castano and Dr. Sanchez had different experiences and takes, which is their right.&nbsp;

				Actually both articles are not opinion pieces. There are no opinions in Mr. Castaño&#039;s article. It is a journalistic account of what took place on July 24. <br /><br />Although Dr. Sánchez&#039;s piece is written in the first person, that doesn&#039;t discount the fact that Mr. Taylor grabbed Sánchez’s notebook and crossed out his notes, which is something that Taylor does not deny.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is another piece by Dr. Sánchez, just published at QueensLatino.com, called The BID: Destruction of Immigrant Networks and Community<br />http://www.queenslatino.com/bid-destruction-immigrant-networks-community/

				I’ve known Seth Taylor for some time and would be surprised if he behaved in a way that was not professional. Personally, I think Seth has done an excellent job running the 82nd Street Partnership in its current form.<br />That said, I think it’s also possible to question whether the BID would be a good thing good thing for the businesses on Roosevelt Avenue, a very different business environment. <br />I’m not sure about assertions that it will reduce crime. JHBG sponsored a Town Hall meeting on policing in June and 115 Precinct officials told us they have two special shifts operation on a portion of Roosevelt Avenue. One can make a good case that services like police protection and sanitation should be provided by the city and not by a private organization, especially since the city is in relatively good financial shape unlike in the past when BIDs were desperately needed. <br />These are my personal views and not that of any group with which I am associated.<br /><br />&nbsp;

Nobody is disputing the fact that gentrification is happening. If rents go up faster than the incomes of the community members, they get pushed out. If it happens more slowly, the entire community can benefit from it. It&#039;s the difference between being able to ride the wave or getting swept away by it.

				I think the BID in a vacuum sounds reasonable, but NYC isn&#039;t like any other city. It has limited supply of space and property, and the demand is high. The wealthy have taken over Manhattan and are pushing the upper middle class, hipsters, and yuppies into the outer boroughs - particularly Brooklyn. The bottom line is that enough merchants on Roosevelt Ave feel as if their livelihoods are threatened and their clientele don&#039;t want to be pushed out of their own neighborhood. I wonder if people realize that Roosevelt Ave is already a thriving and successful commercial district. I can&#039;t blame them for firing back. They don&#039;t want to &quot;compete with Long Island and Manhattan.&quot; Even if gentrification cannot ultimately be stopped, wouldn&#039;t we all do what we could to try to preserve what we had and live to fight another day? To me, the people have spoken. The BID was advertised as a democratic process, and it just doesn&#039;t have enough broad support for it.

The rising commercial rent is probably going to increase too much cost and force them to close as shown in other gentrified area. The rising residential rent is also pushing out many tenants, resulting in the the loss of local customers for these local businesses.

				I haven&#039;t been to the SkyView Center mall in Flushing recently, but when I was last there, I was surprised by how many vacant stores there were. It may just be the result of it opening at the wrong time, during the recession. The SkyView Center is within walking distance of the proposed mall that would be built on parkland in Flushing Park. I don&#039;t think we need a new mall, especially on parkland. <br /><br />I know that the proposed mall in Flushing Park promised financial support to the JH Corona BID, but if the mall does not open, it is safe to say that money will not be there to support the BID. I believe it was a small amount of money, not enough to have strong influence. <br /><br />I&#039;m against having the mall built, but I can understand arguments for and against the BID - I&#039;m undecided on this.

				If you look at the list circulated you will see BIDs in all types of neighborhoods. (check out the Bronx list, where I lived for 25 years.)&nbsp; The argument is that our taxes should be taking care of these services, but we know that in this time of decreased resources, this is not happening. (I&#039;d like to see these groups put pressure on City Hall if they think they&#039;re being shortchanged.) To pick up the slack, the community has to do it&#039;s part.

				I live here too,<br /><br />You seem to be reading some assumptions into my post. Nowhere did I write that bars and restaurants are the <em>only</em> alternative to dollar stores. I asked a sincere question: besides bars and restaurants--because I think new ones can survive the neighborhood--what kind of other merchants do we think can honestly flourish? A gym, sure, probably also a good butcher and bakery (again, food related). I don&#039;t doubt that a regular Gap or H&amp;M would do fine, but whether those would be desirable additions I&#039;ll let someone else answer. Certainly they wouldn&#039;t add to any sense of local ownership, but I think that&#039;s an overrated quality anyway.<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;ve also lived in other middle and working class neighborhoods. Their shopping options were no better than ours, and in many respects were much, much worse.<br /><br />

				It seems to me that if the shops make more money, the landlords will just raise the rent. I&#039;m not sure what is the solution, people in NYC have a higher tolerance to pain in regards to sucking the life out of us in order to make it here. Those rents on Roosevelt are not cheap at all. <br /><br /><br />We are definitely spoiled by the shopping available to us in NYC, I think we forget that in most other places people actually have to travel to get errands done. I was just in Bed-Stuy area the other day, finding ourselves getting ingredients for cooking dinner, and the nearest asian grocery was miles and miles away. Crazy!<br /><br /><br />what do we need?....<br />I&#039;d love to have a pillow store so I can conveniently try out a bunch of them, but I&#039;ll just suck it up and go to Macy&#039;s. We do have a great wine store, but no great beer store (although you can get growlers to-go at UFC).

				The 82nd Street BID is not about displacing existing businesses.&nbsp; They are about helping JH businesses adapt, survive and thrive. As a matter of fact, they promote existing businesses.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t people speak to the businesses on their directory about how they feel about the partnership they are experiencing. For instance:<br /><br />http://www.82ndstreet.org/2014/08/sabor-ecuatoriano/<br /><br />http://www.82ndstreet.org/business-directory/<br /><br />http://www.82ndstreet.org/business-services/<br /><br />There is so much misinformation out there about the BID it&#039;s sad.&nbsp;

				one hurdle&nbsp; -- not an insurmountable one -- is the 7 train. <br />whenever i&#039;ve been on a busy shopping strip under an elevated train, the shops seem slightly more downscale than shopping strips even a block or two away, the vibe grittier. frankly, streets under elevated train tracks just LOOK dirty, dirtier than they actually are, maybe because sunlight is largely blocked. i&#039;m thinking of Brighton Beach Avenue. million dollar oceanfront condos are literally a couple of hundred yards away, but the street is funky, messy, kinda dirty. the same is true in a lot of the southern part of brooklyn and in the bronx. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				definitely the most in-depth piece i&#039;ve seen.<br /><br />i find it kind of laughable that councilwoman Ferreras insists that the BID will NOT cause property values to rise -- and kind of scary to see all the salivating about &quot;rebranding&quot; the area.....

				January 2, 2015/ News / Economy / Jackson Heights<br />Jax Hts BID still voting<br />By Bill Parry<br />TimesLedger Newspapers<br />Contrary to a published report, the project to expand the 82nd Street Business Improvement District from Jackson Heights into<br />Corona is not on hold but moving forward.<br />The BID’s new executive director, Leslie Ramos, is concerned that some business owners and residents might be tearing up their<br />ballots as a result of word on the street since the online article appeared just prior to Christmas.<br />DNAinfo reported that the 82nd Street Partnership plan “is temporarily on hold” and “the process has been postponed” until the new year.<br />“The voting has never been closed and that’s something that’s very important for stakeholders to know,” Ramos said. “The process is not on hold. We were just slowed by<br />events like our Christmas tree lighting and Small Business Saturday. We’ve never been on hold and the ballots are still being accepted. In fact, they can call and we’ll go and<br />pick them up because at the end of the day this is something the neighborhood wants and we’re moving forward.”<br />Ramos, a longtime member of the Bloomberg administration, took the position in October after Executive Director Seth Taylor’s surprise departure to assume the leadership<br />of a BID in Manhattan.<br />She inherited a controversial proposal that would expand the business district from 82nd Street along Roosevelt Avenue to 104th Street and include Junction Boulevard to<br />45th Avenue.<br />The project has created a formidable opposition of anti-gentrification groups among small business owners and vendors along Roosevelt Avenue.<br />“That’s one of the reasons I came here,” Ramos said. “I’m very passionate about moving this project forward because we can’t have the city grow and flourish while leaving<br />these neighborhoods behind. I took this to make sure we have a strong business district in a community of color, especially a Latino community. We deserve a neighborhood<br />as nice as any other.”<br />The 43-year-old Ramos began her career at the City Office of Management and Budget, where she was in charge of overseeing all agencies responsible for the economic<br />prosperity of the city, including the Department of Small Business Services, the Economic Development Corporation and the Department of City Planning. She went on to<br />serve as executive director of the mayor’s Office for Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses, and the assistant commissioner for finance at the Department of Housing<br />Preservation and Development.<br />“I only started two months ago and I am still catching up on administrative business,” Ramos said. “This process will take a long time as I’m meeting one-on-one with any<br />business owner that wants to. I am pressing ahead on this because we need to make sure we don’t allow uneven development. I’m making my way through the community<br />because at the end of the day we need a stable, long-term and sustainable business section.”<br />Jax Hts BID still voting • TimesLedger Page 1 of 2<br />http://
