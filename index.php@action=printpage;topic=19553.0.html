				Does anyone know, if you want to do a gut renovation of 2 BD 2 BA co-op, how much would it cost? I know that I should contact a contractor, but if anyone did it, could you share approx cost for the reno? I am just exploring right now and want to find out if 100k is enough or am I not realistic?<br /><br />Thank you, and looking forward to hear from anyone.

				Be sure to shop around for contractors--I believe prices vary a lot. If there is a contractor who has worked extensively in your building, or is connected to your building, that&#039;s a big advantage over someone not familiar with the innards of the building or its requirements. In our case, our super is part of a contracting company, and it&#039;s been great to have them do our renovations, since they are always around and accessible and flexible to handle last-minute issues.

				Costs vary by contractor but 100K should cover a standard gut reno (i.e., without moving walls, pipes, DOB approvals etc.). By standard I mean demo, plaster/skimcoating walls + ceilings, sanding existing floors, tiling in bathrooms (pouring a new concrete base may add complexity and cost), installing new bathroom fixtures (without moving piping), new kitchen (again, cabinet demo and replacement) without moving pipes or walls. Good luck!

				&nbsp;I am finding this interesting as we were given a 25K estimate for a small bathroom renovation without changing the floor plan. Also they suggested we move out for a month! Yes, check around.

				We just did a gut renovation on our bathroom that has both tub and shower. Pipes and shutoff valves were replaced, walls were tiled halfway up the walls and all the way up around tub/shower. I just now totaled it all up and will preface the total by saying we could have shaved a few thousand off at least if we&#039;d gotten less expensive tiles, a less expensive tub, less expensive shower fittings. That&#039;s where we splurged. What we did is fairly high end. Total was $27,000. Roughly half of that was contractor cost, including plumbing and electric, skim coating, painting, and tiling--the rest was fixtures and materials, including paint, tile, marble trim, new window. We shopped separately for fixtures--we did not buy through the contractor, because we wanted a wide choice and to not be limited to whatever the contractor sells via his preferred suppliers. It would have been less costly to go the other route I&#039;m sure. Depends on what you want. I think the labor costs for the job were quite reasonable.

				Thank you all! I found so many articles where it says that cost of renovation in NYC is 200-300 per square ft, so I was afraid 100k won&#039;t get me anywhere. <br />

				European, for our most recent renovation we gut-renovated the kitchen and opened up the galley walls. I interviewed six contractors, and we settled on Sync Constructionâ€”who happens to be in the neighborhood. They had the most detailed proposal and foresaw some issues the others didn&#039;t. His subcontractors like the plumber who trenched a new gas hardline to move the stove were impressive. Can&#039;t recommend them highly enough.<br /><br />https://syncconstruction.com/<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/IquNeTmm.jpg)<br /><br />More photos here:<br /><br />https://blog.sweeten.com/before-after/kitchens/integrated-white-kitchen-jackson-heights/<br /><br />Renovation diary:<br /><br />https://renov8or.blogspot.com/2019/01/jackson-heights-kitchen-renovation-before-after.html
