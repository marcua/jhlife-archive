					We actually did move from JH to City Island a couple of years ago.&nbsp; We definitely miss the JH neighborhood, our friends in our coop, the weekly Farmer’s Market, and all the restaurants, but City Island is a breath of fresh sea air!&nbsp; It has a great small town feel (less than 5,000 residents) and you pass through the largest park in NYC (Pelham Bay Park) to get there.&nbsp; City Island, like most places, has a few drawbacks, but when we enter the park and cross the bridge to City Island, we feel transported and the weariness of the city slough off of us.

					There was a car coming north from 77th St. making a left onto 37th Ave.&nbsp; It was speeding to make the light, it lost control and hit a parked car which had a driver in it.&nbsp; The parked car plowed into the phone booth and a tree and hit a pedestrian who was walking her dog.&nbsp; The pedestrian and the driver in the parked car were taken to Elmhurst Hospital.<br /><br />I know the pedestrian and she has broken ribs, a concussion, scratches and bruises.&nbsp; She is lucky to be alive.<br /><br />When will the bad careless driving, speeding, illegal turns and u-turns cease in our neighborhood?

					<strong>Finally, a new bistro in our area near Sripraphai!</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife and I went to Casa Del Chef Bistro Friday night and we had a great meal (39-06 64th Street).&nbsp; It&#039;s refreshing to have a &quot;new American&quot; type bistro in the ethic restaurant centric Woodside area.&nbsp; We live in Jackson Heights and have been long waiting for a restaurant like this in the area.&nbsp; Chef Alfonso is fantastic and has an impressive culinary pedigree, having worked at Bouley and at Blue Hill Stone Farms.<br /><br />The $35 tasting menu is one of the best values in the city.&nbsp; Take advantage of it before they start charging closer to what it&#039;s truly worth, which is significantly higher than the $35 fare.&nbsp; Also, no corkage fee if you bring your own, and they do have wine if you don&#039;t bring your own.<br /><br />There&#039;s a great Chowhound review <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/988399" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/988399</a> on the place and I agree with the comments posted.&nbsp; &nbsp;I give the place 5 stars for the restaurant&#039;s ambition and because I hope more people try it out. The food is great, but needs some tweaking, and the service is friendly and aims to please, but needs some refinement.&nbsp; I suspect that food and service will truly earn their 5 stars shortly having been open only 3 weeks.<br />

					We&#039;ve been buying meat from the Sun/Grass Fed farmer&#039;s market vendor for the past year and have enjoyed the clean taste of their meats.&nbsp; They will also take special requests.&nbsp; I ordered beef tongue and about 20 steaks for a large barbecue.&nbsp; The only thing about the Farmer&#039;s Market is that you can&#039;t get chicken there.<br /><br />As for a butcher, I&#039;ve stopped in the Boina Roja butcher (next to the restaurant) and ended up not buying anything.&nbsp; It smelled a little too gamely for me.&nbsp; For a legit butcher shop I&#039;ve frequented International Meat Market in Astoria, they are fantastic. It&#039;s a little pricey but they have good meats and have some items that are hard to find (e.g., slab bacon, whole rabbit, fresh beef liver cut to order, lamb shoulder &amp; ribs, D&#039;Artagnan foie gras, excellent souvlaki skewers, etc.).&nbsp; They even grind meat for you on the spot.&nbsp; Get there early and get a number, otherwise you&#039;ll be waiting a while.&nbsp; PS, they are closed on Sundays.

					I think one of the main problems with drivers licenses is that people take driving as a right. By that I mean a license should not necessarily mean you should continue to drive, especially since an automobile or motorcycle can be considered a very dangerous weapon.<br /><br />Yes, you do have to take a written test and a road test, and in most cases you only have to take those once in your life. This is where I have a problem with driver&#039;s licenses. Take a physician&#039;s medical license or a nurse&#039;s license to practice, they are required to renew these periodically, take continuing education classes each year, and continually prove competency. Why couldn&#039;t we have a similar process in place for driver&#039;s licenses.<br /><br />My mother, who is 65+, has a valid driver&#039;s license, yet she has not driven in almost 20 years and there is no way I would get in the car if she did decide to drive. Since she last drove, there have been so many more things to consider when driving, e.g., cell phones, bike lanes, speeding cameras, HOV lanes, many many more vehicles on the road, an increase in the size of cars (the SUV phenomena), her slower reaction times, her worsening vision, etc. It maybe more of a burden to citizens, but why not require continuing driving education and driver&#039;s tests every few years in order to renew drivers&#039; licenses?<br /><br />Driving should be treated more like a privilege that is earned, rather than an innate right and then maybe we can then have safer streets.

					I&#039;m not a commercial real estate expert, but I gotta believe that if all these 99 cent stores, laundry-mats and ethnic restaurants in Jackson Heights can make it, why couldn&#039;t a new American restaurant?&nbsp; There may be competition with Starbucks and other corporate stores for commercial real estate, but aren&#039;t these local places also competing with the corporates as well?&nbsp; How can all these other places afford the &quot;over-inflated commercial rents&quot; of the neighborhood while new ventures can&#039;t?<br /><br />As others have noted, Arunee, in its new location with it&#039;s new look, has been doing very well.&nbsp; It&#039;s always packed when we pass by and it&#039;s prices aren&#039;t exactly cheap.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been there a couple of times to try it and we found the service to be almost dismissive.&nbsp; That said, it&#039;s not our first choice for Thai in the neighborhood.&nbsp; We&#039;d much rather go to Zabb Elee (the grilled gizzards and hearts on a stick are our favorites) or Playground.&nbsp; But we believe that the same folks that flock to Arunee can afford and would want something more than just great cheap ethnic food.&nbsp; In terms of what the neighborhood can sustain with regards to affordability, just look at the popularity and lines at Starbucks or Espresso 77 for coffee drinks that typically cost three times that of a regular cup of coffee from a local deli.&nbsp; The population is here.<br /><br />As far as Happy Kitchen is concerned, we happen to like it, but it&#039;s a Japanese kitchen first and foremost that happens to serve sushi, sashimi and ramen.&nbsp; Compared to Takesushi in Sunnyside or Katsuno in Forest Hills for sushi, and to Hinomaru on Ditmars for ramen, Happy Kitchen pales in comparison.<br /><br />Finally regarding Bushwick, the rent discrepancies will soon change.&nbsp; With Roberta&#039;s, Blanca, Dear Bushwick and other culinary destinations, affordable residential rents, new construction and convenient transportation, Bushwick will be/is the next hot spot in Brooklyn that&#039;ll soon resemble Williamsburg.

					We need a good restaurant like LIC Market . . . The ethnic food choices are great, but that&#039;s all we got here.&nbsp; When we want to go to a new American restaurant with a good bar, we usually head to Astoria or LIC.&nbsp; Also, a legit sushi place, a great breakfast place, we second a good ramen shop, another coffee shop like E77, and an oyster bar . . . <br /><br />Outside of food, how about a nice bike shop, a dog run close to Traver&#039;s Park with separate areas for large and small dogs (the one under the BQE is terrible and Sperry Dog Run is too far away) and like others have said, a nice, large and clean gym.

					We have RCN and we like it a lot (we&#039;re in Dunolly Gardens). We&#039;ve had Optimum (the worst), TWC (2nd worst), and FIOS (just about as good as RCN).&nbsp; With RCN, you get TiVo and Netflix and they have more HD channels that we actually watch than the others.&nbsp; And during Super Storm Sandy, we didn&#039;t lose RCN service at all, while we heard our neighbors with TWC lost TV, phone and internet service.
