				Yeah, I hear them too. Seems to be a trend, as there was a NYT article today saying the city received 80 times as many illegal fireworks complaints this month vs last year. <br />

				Yes, awful.&nbsp; Up way later than I wanted to be calming dog.&nbsp; This has become a problem this time of year in the last two or three years.&nbsp; Home fireworks are still illegal in NYC, yes?&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone called into WNYC the other day urging people not to call the police (because the police) but to put up signs or otherwise try to get neighbors to stop informally.&nbsp; But I have no idea who or where exactly, and am always in the for the night when they start.&nbsp; Anyone else have ideas about how to get the word out that they really are a nuisance? <br /><br />Thanks!

				The people doing it know that others don&#039;t like it, but they do it anyway. They don&#039;t care. So, there&#039;s really nothing that can be done, I guess. <br />Many of these displays are not just at-home fireworks (which, yes are illegal in NYC) but closer to professional grade pieces. They can be pretty dangerous, not only to the people setting them off, but to others too. Especially when they&#039;re set off in proximity to residential dwellings. I&#039;ve read some articles about fires started from them which have resulted in deaths.<br />Not sure what can be done though. I&#039;m pretty confident posting signs asking them not to do it will accomplish nothing. If we can&#039;t trust the police to take care of it without murdering the people setting them off...then I guess it&#039;s just part of life? I feel bad for the sleeping kids being woken up and the pets freaking out. Does that make me a gentrifier? Dunno.

				i&#039;ve seen some people say this is &quot;just kids having fun.&quot;<br /><br />that&#039;s B.S. these are 20 and 30 something bros (some older) trying to show their manhood. it was the case in Astoria when i lived there and Carroll Gardens before i moved there. curiously, when i lived in majority Black areas (like Bed Stuy and Flatbush in the 80s), fireworks were never a problem. not sure what that means, just a bit of info.

				Lots of fireworks around 11 o&#039;clock in the low 70&#039;s.&nbsp; I took a walk to see if I could find the location but they are spaced out so much it was hard to get a read where they are coming from.

				I can&#039;t believe our lawmakers&#039; advice was to go talk to our neighbors and shame them into stopping. Yeah, like I&#039;m going to take a risk like that. I&#039;m glad that people are pushing back.<br /><br />I don&#039;t hear them as much now that I have my a/c running more, but the ones last night seemed pretty close (low 70s). I feel bad for the dogs and babies.

				&nbsp;The lower 70s are a much different part of Jackson Heights. Lot&#039;s more single family houses and <br />entertainment like fire pits, grills and play areas are more common. So is this kind of activity which<br />I believe is seen as personal fun this time of year.
