				It has been a while since we&#039;ve caught up on news in the neighborhood&#039;s momo scene.<br /><br />Jeff Orlick&#039;s 2014 Momo Crawl was held last November (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=12598), and it drew crowds of people to the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff has recently posted a great overview (http://iwantmorefood.com/2015/10/04/momo-crawl-2014-wrap/) of the event to his blog.&nbsp; He announced that the winner of the 2014 trophy was Lhasa Fast Food (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lhasa-fast-food-jackson-heights), the legendary &quot;secret&quot; momo shop hidden behind a cell phone store on 74th Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, Jeff has announced that the 2015 Momo Crawl (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=13877) will be held on Saturday, November 14th.<br /><br />Today, Joe DiStefano writes about a secret new momo (http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2015/11/secret-momo-discovered-at-jackson-heights-momo-speakeasy/) at this secret momo shop, a beef-and-chive variety.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Any other momo news?

				I have lots of news but I want to hear what other people say. I&#039;ll tell you this nugget though, there is one place that will definitely not be on the Momo Crawl. It&#039;s a counter at DigiPlus on 75th street south of Roosevelt.&nbsp; They are too small an operation for the crawl but its definitely interesting and you should check out. They also make freshly ground masala for the tea. The guy there was a doctor in Nepal and now he&#039;s serving momos --- isn&#039;t that crazy? NYC has such potential because we have doctors, lawyers, very educated people who come here and have to start out selling food or driving taxis... The next wave always grows so quickly because of it.

				Congratulations to Jeff Orlick (and Jackson Heights generally) on another successful Momo Crawl!&nbsp; I missed it yet again, but my family was there, and they had a great time.&nbsp; <br /><br />The crowds were quite large again, perhaps due to writeups in The Voice (http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/best-weekend-food-events-thanksgiving-wine-workshop-momo-crawl-and-barback-games-7910439) and Gothamist (http://gothamist.com/2015/11/09/momo_crawl_2015.php).&nbsp; &nbsp;And they were enthusiastic, too.&nbsp; Some were so inspired by the tasty dumplings that they got free momo tattoos (https://instagram.com/p/-FeADKSDuS/) at Mohan&#039;s Tattoo Inn (http://www.mohanstattooinn.com/), which has just set up shop here in Jackson Heights (http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20151109/jackson-heights/legendary-nepali-tattoo-artist-opens-jackson-heights-shop).<br /><br />Even the map was awesome, as it has been every year.&nbsp; This time, each copy looked freshly sketched by pencil (https://instagram.com/p/-EdfhHmice/).&nbsp; It was an unusual and impressive printing job by Digiplus on Roosevelt.&nbsp; <br /><br />This year&#039;s winner, according to Jeff&#039;s Twitter feed, was Amdo Kitchen (https://twitter.com/JeffOrlick/status/665699722603139073), which is a truck that can often be found on 37th Road. <br /><br />Here are some highlights from Twitter (https://twitter.com/search?q=%23momocrawl)

				Is Amdo kitchen the truck that&#039;s usually parked catty-corner to the pedestrian plaza almost under the train tracks?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, I think they&#039;re good but I wish these guys would use less gristly meat (I mean all of the momo sellers, not just Amdo).

				Yes, Amdo is usually parked on 37th Road near Diversity Plaza. I go for their chicken momos which are awesome. My only wish, and like yours Lilybell, it&#039;s a general one to all Momo-sellers, is that I wish they served the momos with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce like a Chinese dumpling place, in addition to all the spicy sauces. I realize that&#039;s just not how it&#039;s done, but it&#039;s the taste I crave when I pop one of them in my mouth.

				The one time I tried Amdo, I was underwhelmed. It was fine, but not a contender. But I don&#039;t do hot sauce, so perhaps it&#039;s the sauce that tilted people in its favor. I&#039;d rather go upstairs to Phayul, or to Lali Guras, which has the best yellow sauce that&#039;s spicy but not super hot.

				tried for the first time yesterday, and the momo were so so good, especially the Jhol Momo (served with a sesame-like spicy sambal).<br /><br />but we might have to start searching for the truck -- as i was waiting for my order, the manager of the Citibank came out and started loudly warning the people inside that they had to move, because they were &quot;blocking&quot; the doors. not sure exactly how, since the truck is on the street, and there&#039;s plenty of room on either side of the vehicle, but.....

				Amdo definitely have the most watery juicy momo. I like the Tawa Deli one as their seasoning is better.<br /><br />I missed the momo crawl last year, anyone know if they improve the line, instead cooking momo when order they should just cook a large batch. I went few years ago, the line was long. Waited forever just to eat two momo, since I was want to try all of them on the map but end up only trying five places and left hungry.<br /><br />Looking forward for this year.

				I finally tried the Momo Bros. truck over the weekend and I didn&#039;t like it at all, nor did my two companions. I had the beef and found it to be way too garlicky with a pronounced flavor of cinnamon (or maybe it was nutmeg). I was bummed because I did think the quality of the beef was a step above the competition.&nbsp; The worst part is that I asked for one order and he gave me two - I paid for it anyway thinking they&#039;d be good but I ended up throwing the second plate away. <br /><br />I&#039;ll probably give it another chance to try the jhol momo.

				<strong>Winter Salvation, Fresh From the Dumpling Steamer, in Queens<br /></strong><br />In winter, momos are salvation: hot dumplings with swirled pleats, fresh from the steamer, arriving in a cloudy rush of ascending souls.<br /><br />To eat them outdoors in winter, shivering, with numb, fumbling fingers, is even more of a wonder. At the Amdo Kitchen food truck in Jackson Heights, Queens, momos come huddled unceremoniously, eight for $5 on a disposable plate; bow your head over them and the steam kisses your face.<br /><br />Thubten Amchok, the owner and chef, grew up in the Amdo region of Tibet and fled to Nepal and then India before settling in the U.S. in 1995. A former monk, he started selling momos from a pushcart six years ago. Now his truck — emblazoned with Tibetan and American flags, snow lions alongside stars and stripes — rolls out daily, weather permitting. (Snowdrifts from the recent storm piled up so high, he couldn’t park on the street for two weeks.)<br /><br />full article Winter Salvation, Fresh From the Dumpling Steamer, in Queens (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/dining/amdo-kitchen-review-potala-momo.html?mabReward=CTS2&amp;recid=0zFpG9gFXlue7QAhukikkzoYwAO&amp;recp=7&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=CColumn&amp;module=Recommendation&amp;src=rechp&amp;WT.nav=RecEngine&amp;_r=0)<br /><br />(https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/dining/17HUNGRY-Potala-slide-VAO3/17HUNGRY-Potala-slide-VAO3-superJumbo.jpg)

				Potato Momos Only!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;As a veggie Momo lover, I would rank the potato momos of JH as<br /><br />1. Phayul<br />2. the truck that is always there at diversity plaza (near side) that has indifferent service.<br /><br />Are there any other potato momos in the hood that I should be eating? I find the mixed-vegetable ones not to my liking (cabbage?)

				That last picture is funny. That was the table doing momo drawings and those paintings are from the Momo App. She decided to do portraits for a dollar and that guy got his portrait done not once but twice - each time he said it wasn&#039;t good and discarded the drawing right away... idk, that&#039;s funny to me. <br /><br /><br />It was the best Momo Crawl ever though
