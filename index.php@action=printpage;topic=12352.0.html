				My mother has a 7 year old Maltese dog, named Cookie, that needs a new home.&nbsp; My sister purchased Cookie 7 years ago from a pet shop.&nbsp; Initially my sister bought the dog for herself but was unable to keep him due to been allergic to the dog.&nbsp; Since she was unable to keep the dog, she gave it to my mother who had no experince with dogs.<br /><br />Cookie has been under my mothers care for the last six years.&nbsp; Cookie is a great looking dog who needs a lot of training.&nbsp; Although he is mostly paper trained, there are days where he&#039;ll pee on the floor.&nbsp; He was never trained to walk outside.&nbsp; He tends to bark a lot, especially when left alone.&nbsp; Since Cookie was never exposed to the outside world he tends to be a nervous dog.&nbsp; I feel that Cookie needs a lot of work to become a &quot;normal&quot; dog.&nbsp; I would&#039;nt recommend him for families with young children.&nbsp; The ideal owner should be someone who can dedicate a lot of time into helping Cookie become a stable dog.&nbsp; Someone with a lot of dog experience.&nbsp; If you think you are that person or know of someone, feel free to text or call me @ 347-213-2017<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
