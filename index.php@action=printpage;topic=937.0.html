				Thanks to Helen for organizing a successful Queens Green Drinks at Terraza Cafe. It was nice meeting those of you who were there. My name is actually Cris- I know I met Will and that Todd was there...<br /><br />Terraza is a great place. Its worth a visit, especially if you have folks visiting from out of the zip code...<br /><br />Though I was wearing the Transportation Alternatives Queens Committee hat last night, I look forward to working on many of the initiatives other groups in the neighborhood are proposing. It was a great opportunity to network. Hope we can all get together again soon!<br /><br />Thanks again, Helen and the Queens Drinks gang!

				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>March Queens Green Drinks</strong></span><br />Wednesday, March 18<br /><br />6:30pm - 9:00pm<br />at Himalayan Tea House in Astoria<br />33-17 31st Avenue&nbsp; @ 34th St<br /><br />Hosted by the the Astoria CSA at Himalayan Tea House in Astoria!<br /><br />Astoria CSA started with a group of like-minded individuals in late-2006 who wanted to bring affordable, local, organic produce to their neighborhood.&nbsp; Our first season was summer 2007 with 100 shares.&nbsp; In 2009, to keep delivery running smooth and efficiently we will reduce to 125 shares (includes 15 low-income shares).&nbsp; The Astoria CSA is a juggernaut, offering members everything from basic vegetable and fruit shares to local wine, beer, meats, cheeses, bread, tomatoes and even cranberries.<br /><br />What is CSA?<br />Community Support Agriculture (CSA) is a mutually beneficial partnership between a local, organic farm and a neighborhood that desires fresher, healthier produce. Before the growing season starts, each CSA member purchases a produce share. As a shareholder in the farm, a CSA member receives a weekly share of the harvest throughout the growing season. Payment is required before the season begins, to provide a stable financial base for the farm. This allows the farmer to purchase seeds, hire labor, and get the season started without having to take out high-interest loans. In order to make the CSA work, every member pitches in. <br /><br />Why Local?<br />Local food tastes better because it arrives to you fresher and crisper than food found in a market (which travels on average 1,500 miles and takes 2 weeks to reach you). Local food is a personal stand against Agribusiness. Local food supports local families, and the New York State economy. Also, local food reconnects you with your home and season in ways long forgotten by many city dwellers.<br /><br /><br />How do we get to the Himalayan Tea House by public transportation?<br /><br />By Subway: N/W to 30th Ave or Broadway.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />What&#039;s Queens Green Drinks again? <br /><br />Very simply, it&#039;s an informal social gathering/networking event for folks that are environmentally minded.

				<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">May 2010 Queens Green Drinks</span></strong><br />Monday, May 17th <br />7:00pm - 9:30pm*<br />&nbsp;at Hellgate Social in Astoria<br /><br />*note later start time!<br /><br />Hosted by Western Queens Compost Initiative &nbsp;in Astoria!<br /><br />The Western Queens Compost Initiative started out in 2008 as Two Coves Compost Project to handle composting at a large, by NYC standards, community garden. In 2009, the WQCI tabled at the TD 5 Boro Bike Ride rest stop in Astoria Park, collecting hundreds of pounds of peel and diverting them from a landfill. They were brought to Two Coves garden to be composted.<br /><br />Still, with over 200 gardeners to serve, as well as greening partners who were requesting compost for street trees, there was a huge demand that couldn&#039;t be met. On the other hand, there are several CSA&#039;s with excess members in the Astoria/LIC area, and plenty of food scraps (about 5,000lbs weekly from CSA households alone). Much of these scraps from local and often organic farms are being trashed and trucked out to putrefy in landfills hundreds and even thousands of miles away, creating harmful GHG&#039;s and toxic runoffs.<br /><br />In order to keep this potentially vital resource composted locally and managed responsibly, the WQCI enlisted the human resources of the CSA&#039;s, and will also collect from Greenmarkets in the area. In order to do so sustainably, as well as to be able to transport peels from the various bike tours with the least amount of environmental impact possible, the WQCI is fundraising for a $2,500 work trike from a Queens business with a 1000lb capacity, so that transporting food scraps can be done without requiring the operator of this vehicle to have a license or insurance, and most importantly without harming the environment or compromising cyclist and pedestrian safety.<br /><br />Keep up the Western Queens Compost Initiative on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Western-Queens-Compost-Initiative/329195924603?ref=ts&amp;v=wall#!/pages/Western-Queens-Compost-Initiative/329195924603?v=info&amp;ref=ts) or Twitter (http://twitter.com/wqnscompost).<br /><br /><strong>How do you get to May Queens Green Drinks at Hellgate Social?</strong><br /><br />Hellgate Social (http://www.hellgatesocial.com/)<br />12-21 Astoria Blvd b/w 12 St and 14 St<br />Astoria<br /><br />Bike: From points south, take the Vernon Blvd bike lanes, follow the curve at Main Ave, past Two Coves Community Garden, and Hellgate Social is a block and a half past the garden on your left.<br /><br />By Subway: &nbsp;N/W train to Astoria blvd. stop.

APA sponsors clean ups, participates in the NYC Greeters Corps, and seeks to facilitate communication between park users and the NYC Parks Department. Astoria Park Alliance has installed a Butterfly Garden, a bulletin board and most recently, garbage cans in the park. Our mission is to beautify, enhance and encourage greater community involvement within Astoria Park. Building a Community starts in the Park! <br /><br />The Community Plot of Two Coves Community Garden (or CP for short) is a shared garden space located at the heart of Two Coves Community Garden in Astoria. It was created in 2008, the vision of a group of Two Coves members to create a space for the garden community to come together. Since then, it has grown into a place where everyone - garden members, neighbors, and friends - is welcome to garden, harvest, and learn together. Most recently, with the help, muscle, and support of dedicated community members, the CP constructed 9 raised beds - which were then installed, filled with soil and planted. We&#039;ve also hosted Garden Together sessions with Crop Mob NYC and the Variety Girls and Boys Club of Queens, and held a&nbsp; plant sale in partnership with Build it Green!NYC and R &amp; R General Supply. Our goal is simple: to grow community, and some food!<br /><br /><strong>How do you get to June&#039;s Queens Green Drinks?</strong><br /><br />Bohemian Hall Beer Garden (http://www.bohemianhall.com/en/Index.php)<br />29-19 24th Ave.<br />Astoria, NY 11102<br /><br />Bike: Use the Vernon Blvd Bike Lane<br /><br />By Subway:&nbsp; <br />N/Q to Astoria Blvd.&nbsp; <br />Then walk NORTH on 31st Street for 1 block.<br />Take a left on 24th Ave.<br />Bohemian Beer Garden will be on the right hand side, 29-19 24th Ave.<br /><br /><strong>What&#039;s Queens Green Drinks again?</strong><br /><br />Very simply, it&#039;s an informal social gathering/networking event for folks that are environmentally minded.
