				Cyclists should use the bike lane and pedestrians should use the rest of the road and the sidewalks.&nbsp; That goes for joggers too.&nbsp; The bike lane is the bike lane.

				a cyclist who&#039;s interested in fitness (ie speed) should not be on the walking path, bike lane or not. there are often too many people and even the barricades are sometimes in the bike lane. <br /><br />kids and people going at a leisurely pace with family should be fine, but they should not be moving at a pace that you should be concerned with at all. <br /><br />your story is ridiculous, i&#039;d probably be screaming expletives back at them, bike lane or not.

				Many cyclists are definitely going to fast and zooming around pedestrians, barricades, in and out of the bike lane. I am surprised there hasn&#039;t been any collisions, yet. This goes for the mopeds and scooters, too. I feel safer with the cars on the street!

				Pedestrians have the right of way everywhere. Bicyclists need to slow down and yield. <br />Also, while it&#039;s not clear whether the bike lanes are in effect on 34th Ave, I don&#039;t think they ever repainted the lanes between 69th Street and 75th Street, which causes more confusion. I think this initiative is good overall, but if it&#039;s going to continue, they need to make the regulations clearer.

				&nbsp;This is one of the major topics that needs to be addressed about the 34th Ave Open Streets but which is being tabled by the advocates. People are getting hit and grazed by speeding bicyclists left and right. I think the litigation will be decisive about keeping the streets open and though nothing fatal has occurred yet -thanks god- there have been a number of incidents with cyclists speeding among pedestrians. In fairness to the cyclists, this bike lane has been here for over a decade and was usually busy and then the Open Streets was layered on top without a plan or any active supervision. It would have been helpful to employ the furloughed traffic cops here but there was push back on anyone overseeing the street. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Let&#039;s see what the lawsuits bring and I hope everyone stays safe as our days get shorter and the darkness comes earlier to the open street further hampering a cyclist vision of pedestrians on the Ave.

It&#039;s an accident (or many) waiting to happen. It&#039;s also the reason I have been spending less time on 34th Ave lately. I&#039;m afraid of being run down.

				I used to have a speedometer on my bike and the only way I could reach 20 mph was if I was going down a very steep hill.&nbsp; A normal pace (for me) was about 7 to 8 mph.&nbsp; 5 mph is a nice suggestion, but most bikes are not fitted with speedometers.&nbsp;

I don&#039;t need a specific number to make my point, which is that the way the current situation is on 34th Ave, the bicyclists are going too fast. And yes, I completely agree that if the bike lane were completely cleared for bikes and didn&#039;t have an inattentive pedestrian wandering in, or a child scooting over the line on his scooter, etc. then a bit of increased speed would most likely be ok.<br /><br />But the fact is there&#039;s been no attempt made to clear the bike lanes for bikes, so given that, bikes should make sure to slow down to 5 mph so they don&#039;t hit someone who is errantly in their lane.<br /><br />Btw, Google maps uses a speed of 10 mph when calculating bike speed for directions, but many bicyclists find that the time suggested is too long (which means they are going faster than 10 mph). https://bikingbro.com/what-speed-does-google-maps-assume-for-biking/#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20used%20Google&#039;s,you&#039;re%20riding%20your%20bike.
