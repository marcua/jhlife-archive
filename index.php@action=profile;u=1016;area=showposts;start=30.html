					<strong> &quot;Marley and Me&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;</strong><br /><br />Very good. <strong> &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; </strong>stars Kevin Bacon who&#039;s quite wonderful, Diane Lane and a Jack Russell Terrier. It&#039;s a Southern story about a friendless shy boy who grows up with his puppy Skip.&nbsp; The puppy becomes a well known character in the small town and it is through the puppy that the boy transcends his shyness and grows up.&nbsp; Kevin Bacon&#039;s performance as a bitter WWI Medal of Honor winner crippled from his act of heroism on the battlefield who cannot adequately express his love for his son is very moving.&nbsp; This is a tremendous and restrained performance.<br /><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Marley and Me&quot; </strong>was surprisingly good.&nbsp; Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston from whom I didn&#039;t expect too much&nbsp; were good ... really good ... as a couple from falling in love to marriage to competing careers&nbsp; and raising their children&nbsp; along with their&nbsp; Cesar Milan failure of a puppy who grows up to be very naughty (discipline challenged) and very wonderful family pet.&nbsp; Marley (named after Bob Marley) becomes the subject of Wilson&#039;s, a reporter, newspaper column.&nbsp; <br /><br />A young and loving family ... smart, educated, attractive, responsible grappling with what we all suffer through sans drugs, booze, beatings, car chases, swearing, terminal illness, adultery, teen pregnancy, criminal acts, shootings, racism, self hatred&nbsp; and children who hate their parents and beat up their teachers.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Grey Gardens</strong> <br />Starring Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange<br /><br />The Bouvier relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy who, because of hardtimes, inability to cope with their precariously dwindling finances and just plain loopiness make headlines in the sixties because of their bizarre&nbsp; living conditions, in a once beautiful but now crumbling decaying mansion, Grey Gardens, in Southampton.&nbsp; The mansion that falls on hard times where raccoons, hundreds of feral cats&nbsp; along with its human residents&nbsp; Edie and Edie Biele, mother and daughter live with tons of garbage, no hot water, no electricity, no heat, leaking ceilings and walls falling down, no friends and, of course, no money.&nbsp; They have only themselves and their house and their memories of a time long gone.&nbsp; Grey Gardens is one of the stars of films.&nbsp; It is a metaphor for the lives of its human residents.&nbsp; Once rich and beautiful filled with servants and music and parties&nbsp; and children and a not so happy couple it gets old and decrepit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The parents divorce, the house falls into disrepair because there is no money for upkeep.&nbsp; Slowly their friends disappear, hopes for a career on stage or movies becomes impossible, a transient love affair does not survive.&nbsp; Only the love of the mother and daughter survives all.&nbsp; A couple of brave documentarians, the Maysles, willing to film their wretched lives as is recreates the dreams and hopes for both mother and daughter.&nbsp; No rewrites, no makeovers, no scripts, no second takes ... just a hand held camera and the Bieles as they are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barrymore is an American treasure.&nbsp; It is one of the finest performances ever ... on a par with the best of Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn and Patricia Neal.&nbsp; Barrymore is Barrymore&nbsp; ... brilliant, moving, funny, sad and triumphant!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; She was always a good actress but this role puts her in another pantheon.&nbsp; She is a pure joy to watch.

For this he ought to be drawn and quartered. in Times Square.&nbsp; Last year he donated $165 million dollars to just the arts.&nbsp; In addition he funds his own campaign.&nbsp; This is corruption at its worst!!!?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /><img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; It is a sinister and evil thing to use ones own money instead of using special interest group monies such as ACORN or corporate group money like for instance General Motors and AIG that gave Obama&#039;s campaign millions and millions of dollars only tor receive billions and billions of&nbsp; dollars by the Obama administration in&nbsp; bailouts less that a year later.&nbsp; This is a good thing ... for AIG and GM.&nbsp; They gave millions and millions of dollars to Obama for President and in return Obama as president gave them bilions and billions of dollars.&nbsp; That&#039;s quite a return for their initial investment.&nbsp; Nice of Barry to loot the United Strates Treasury to satisfy the needs of his campaign donors at the expense of the American taxpayer.&nbsp; And we all thought Haliburten was evil incarnate greed at the behest of GWB warlord. <br /><br />You would define Obama and his really good friends ar AIG and GM as the Chosen One and his disciples.&nbsp; &nbsp;Blessed are they that administered to the Chosen One for they shall inherit the United States Treasury.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />You may be the the only voice among 8 million other voices&nbsp; in this city who has defined the Mayor&#039;s philanthropy and charitable giving as the essence of corruption.&nbsp;<strong> [rest of paragraph deleted by moderator because it consisted of a&nbsp; personal attack.&nbsp; Please read the rules of the site and follow them. thanks.]</strong><br />

					Michelle Obama said she did not date her husband when he first asked her out because of that &quot;white thing.&quot;&nbsp; When asked if she was concerned about her husband&#039;s safety if he was elected president, Mrs. Obama said she worried about her husband&#039;s life every time he went to the gas station.&nbsp; That isn&#039;t worry.&nbsp; That&#039;s paranoia.&nbsp; In an interview she says over and over again &quot;All my life I was told I had to be better than whites.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;That what we were told all of our lives.&quot;&nbsp; Black people had to be better than white.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I was sick to death of it.&quot;&nbsp; She continues on &quot;And we had to repay our student loans,.&nbsp; Can you imagine we had to pay our student loans.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />According to Barry Barack Hussein Soetero Obama, his wife chose the church they attended in Chicago.&nbsp; In an&nbsp; interview she confirmed that she chose the church of Rev. Wright because it was uniquely an&nbsp; &quot;Afro-Centric Church.&quot;&nbsp; I chose to use the various names Obama has given himself because the only record available and the only one not sealed because it is an Indonesian school record lists the president as Barry Soetoro citizen of Indonesia of Muslim faith.<br /><br />Barack Obama called his grandmother a racist.&nbsp; She worked into her old age to take care of him when his mother and his dead beat Kenyan farther abandoned him.&nbsp; In a private conversation she said she was afraid of the black teenagers who hassled her at a bus stop. To an entire nation that ungratefull s.o.b. slandered his grandmother.&nbsp; While he made millions of dollars and live in a mansion in Chicago, his grandmother died in squalor?&nbsp; In any case the traitorous Mr. Obama Soetoro whose depiction of his wife beating deadbeat father in &quot;Dreams From My Father&quot; is nothing short of a visionary unsung saint whose principles he so admired that he wished to &quot;inhale them to make them my own.&quot;&nbsp; Whenever he saw his father he said his love grew stronger.&nbsp; According to his sister, his friends and his Kenyan family Obama saw his father but once in his life.&nbsp; In addition his father an alcoholic who ended his life in a DWI accident in which he killed himself and the innocent other driver, was so hateful and so threatening to the government of Kenya he was sent to jail for several years.&nbsp; His own family said he belonged in jail.&nbsp; His white grandmother who loved him and supported him by working into her old age was a racist.&nbsp; His black father who beat his mother and abandoned him was a saint.<br /><br />No one is naive enough to believe that Rev. Wright&#039;s Church is a Christian Church.&nbsp; It is a Black Liberation Theology centric Church.&nbsp; The God they believe in is black.&nbsp; White people are oppressors and are referred to as &quot;white blue-eyed devils.&quot;&nbsp; The hate mongering of that church is not a one time occasional sermon.,&nbsp; It is the crux of Black Liberation Politics which derives its vile hatreds from the Marxist politics of identity.<br /><br />Criticizing the racial politics of identity does not make for racism.&nbsp; Any criticism of Obama is racist, according to you.&nbsp; That kind of response&nbsp; is supposed silence the criticism.&nbsp; Obama came from the most corrupt political machine in the country.&nbsp; It was corrupt when I was young and it is corrupt now.&nbsp; To criticize and wonder how he was able to even&nbsp; enter politics and get himself elected to US Senate&nbsp; without the proper documents is an obligation of the voter.&nbsp; In a corrupt system all things are possible even getting elected without being a citizen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obama posted a birth certificate on his website.&nbsp; It was a forgery.&nbsp; The numbered certificate was out of sequence for the year in which he was born and his racial identity was listed as African American, a term not used until a decade later.&nbsp; He posted a forgery.&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition $700,000 has been paid by his campaign to fight lawsuits to unseal his birth records.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Also, he is the only president in American history who birth place is unknown nthereby violating the demands of the Constitution.&nbsp; &nbsp;California traditionally checked the qualifications of all nominees and candidates.&nbsp; Alan Keyes sued the state of California to prevent their electoral representatives from casting their vote.&nbsp; The ninth circuit dismissed the case.&nbsp; He called it an outrage and a crime.&nbsp; Is Dr. Keyes a racist?<br /><br />For the first time in American history we have a president whose birthplace is unknown to the American electorate.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I am a life long Democrat who has lived in this City all my life. &nbsp;Mayor Bloomberg is a genius who loves this City and he gives New York City millions and millions of dollars a year for the privilege of working for nothing.<br /><br />He&#039;s been a very good Mayor as good as Giuliani. &nbsp;His challengers have been anything but challenging. &nbsp;To carp and whine about better choices for Mayor is ridiculous. &nbsp;We have one of the finest financial minds in America and he works for us for nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;He gives us money!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />And this is is a problem &nbsp;... &nbsp; &nbsp;Our mayor will win again. &nbsp;He&#039;s kept us safe from terror attacks and his great brilliant economic brain has kept this City on track. &nbsp;We, the people of New York City, haven&#039;t had such good luck in this last decade but we&#039;ve had good sound leadership. &nbsp;No other City in the world could have endured what we have endured and remained the greatest City in the world. &nbsp;We&#039;ve had leadership that around the world is recognized as first rate. &nbsp;No matter where in Europe, they always want to come here ... and they always know who the Mayor is. &nbsp;<br /><br />New Yorkers are by nature complainers but when it comes to Mayors, we&#039;ve had some of the best and they haven&#039;t always been Democrats and I didn&#039;t vote for them when they weren&#039;t. &nbsp;I erred. &nbsp;I should have recognized leadership when it presented itself. &nbsp;Instead I chose Party over the best interests of the City. &nbsp;Never again.

					Ruffie, my current little rascal, and I have never encountered an unleased dog.&nbsp; However, my Toby, a sweet, kind, loving, marshmellow of a puppy was attacked twice by unleashed pit bulls.&nbsp; The first one broke the leash and made a beeline for my Toby and it involved my having to kick the other dog.&nbsp; The second one was the worst.&nbsp; The pit bull came from nowhere and with no leash.&nbsp; It got through the fence surrounding the building between 89th &amp; 90th Street on 35th Avenue.&nbsp; Thank god it was only a puppy so when it went for my Toby&#039;s throat its owner who said he wasn&#039;t the owner was able to extricate the dogs.&nbsp; <br /><br />My super who was standing outside at the time came over to help and told the &quot;I am not the owner&quot; guy that he better put the dog on a leash.&nbsp; I was so distraught, I broke down and my puppy who was attacked was trying to comfort me!!!!!!!&nbsp; I never ever walked down that block again.<br /><br />That sweet and very brave little puppy died less than a few months later from complications of diabetes and Cushing&#039;s disease.&nbsp; He was so beloved by the children in my building that they left flowers and notes at my door.&nbsp; He was one of a kind and it was a privilege to be his caretaker.<br /><br />I apologize for the digression but I just had to tell Toby&#039;s story.

					In her strange and odd quest to be or not to be senator Princess Caroline of Camelot has run away from the slings and arrows of outrageous politics.&nbsp; First she said at a very late hour that is was a &quot;personal matter&quot; that precluded her appointment.&nbsp; Later it was the precarious state of her uncle&#039;s health and then it was her unpaid nanny taxes.&nbsp; (In other words, she deducted the money from Nanny&#039;s salary and never sent said funds to the state and federal government.&nbsp; Caroline has a reportedly $400 million dollar fortune and she steals from her nanny??!!!!!!!)&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it was her married or unmarried life and her affair with the publisher of the Old Grey Lady who is married. <br /><br />From one of Camelot&#039;s tribal members came the threat that the Governor was going to pay for being so rotten to the good princess Caroline, notwithstanding her inability to get past one phrase &quot;ya know.&quot;&nbsp; As a Senator she would need more skills than she demonstrated over these past weeks, &quot;ya know.&quot;&nbsp; She obviously has no talent for politics, no talent for transparency, no talent for being open and deft with the press, no talent for public speaking and no talent to be graceful under pressure.&nbsp; <br /><br />None seemed happier than Governor Paterson and Senator Schumer with the appointment of Gillibrand.&nbsp; That appointment has the deft hand of our beloved Senator all over it.&nbsp; We can always count on our Senior Senator to do the right thing.&nbsp; His life is about us.&nbsp; If only he or Bloomberg had run for the Presidency, I could sleep nights.<br /><br />New York has been saved from another two bit carpetbagger.&nbsp; Life is good. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br /><br />
