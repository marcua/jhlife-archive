				Be careful traveling to Queens tonight. Another protest against fares, the MTA, and cops is scheduled for 5-p.m.-or-so this evening in Grand Central and other locations.<br /><br />As an alternative, the Q32 travels through midtown along Madison Avenue and will bring you to the heart of Jackson Heights.

				It is disgraceful that some people think it is OK to vandalize&nbsp; public property that most New Yorkers use and pay for.&nbsp; I am recently retired and pay almost $1,200 a month for my health insurance since I am not eligible for Medicare yet and&nbsp; &nbsp;yet I don&#039;t think I should be able to storm the hospital/medical providers and demand free healthcare.&nbsp; I would also like to be able to afford to eat out more should I be able to go into JH restaurants and be able to demand free food and drink?&nbsp; Anybody who vandalizes public property should be arrested and&nbsp; spend at least a few days in jail.&nbsp; If there is no penalty what is going to prevent people from&nbsp; vandalizing property?
