Not New York Real Estate’s Tech Boom <br />Facebook, Google, Uber and Amazon embrace Manhattan as an East Coast hub<br /></strong><br /><br />By<br />Keiko Morris <br />Updated July 10, 2019 2:26 pm ET <br /><br />Big technology companies are doubling down on New York City by adding millions of square feet in office space and creating thousands of new jobs, with few aftereffects from Amazon.com Inc. ’s nixing of a Queens headquarters.<br /><br />Alphabet Inc. ’s Google last week closed a deal to lease 1.3 million square feet in lower Manhattan, part of Google’s plans to add 7,000 in staff to the city over 10 years.<br /><br />Facebook Inc. is in talks to lease one million square feet of office space at 50 Hudson Yards, a skyscraper under construction on Manhattan’s far West Side, according to a person familiar with the talks. Uber Technologies Inc. and Amazon have been looking for large office space at the Farley Building, say people briefed on the matter. Part of the former James A. Farley Post Office will be used as a train hall for Penn Station.<br /><br />New York is emerging as an East Coast hub for technology because of the size of its labor force, its extensive transportation infrastructure and the cultural and entertainment activities that come with a big city, analysts and real-estate executives said.<br /><br />“New York has lured the talent, and now the employers need to set up shop to lure that talent,” said Kevin Egan, an executive at Oxford Properties Group, which is one of Google’s Manhattan landlords. “These tenants want to be here and need to be here.”<br /><br />The city’s tech frenzy comes barely four months after Amazon stunned developers and others in the business community by canceling plans for a second-headquarters project in Long Island City, Queens. Some elected officials had criticized a government incentive package of as much as $3 billion to lure the retail giant.<br /><br />Amazon’s abrupt reversal sent shock waves through the New York real estate community, with some suggesting that the company’s decision to bolt could discourage other major tech companies from considering the city.<br />Instead, interest among social media, e-commerce and ride-hailing companies has been intensifying. Many of these companies are willing to spend big dollars renting high-end Manhattan real estate, rather than the older office stock in Queens that Amazon was prepared to lease.<br /><br />“A spat between Amazon and a faction of City Council is not going to prevent the continued tech boom of New York,” said Matthew Harrigan, chief executive of Company, a venture that manages a tech-centric serviced office building in Midtown Manhattan.<br /><br />Tech-sector jobs have increased at a faster clip than the city’s overall job growth. The top tech-job categories, which include software publishers, internet publishing and web search portals, averaged 9.6% growth annually between 2009 and 2018 in New York City, according to economist James Parrott at the New School. That growth was almost four times as fast as the average annual private-sector job growth.<br /><br />New York’s prominence as a global financial capital and center of fashion, advertising and marketing makes it attractive for tech companies looking to poach workers from these industries, analysts said.<br /><br />“Social media companies have to sell ads to have revenue streams, and New York City is the advertising capital,” Mr.&nbsp; Parrott said. “If you want smart people in advertising, you have to come to New York City for that.”<br />Tech companies have had a presence in New York City, but now they look eager to go bigger. Since 2015, Uber has more than doubled its office space in New York City to about 160,000 square feet, while Amazon has boosted its office space almost three times to about 800,000 square feet, according to CoStar Group Inc. Facebook’s office space is now at least three times as large as it was five years ago.<br /><br />￼ <br />“A company like Facebook and others are expanding because they are running out of talent in Silicon Valley and San Francisco,” said Paul Leonard, a managing consultant at CoStar.<br /><br />Technology, ad, media and information companies leased 74% more space in the first half of 2019 than they did a year earlier, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield PLC. That group of companies, known as the TAMI sector, leased space at a faster clip than the financial industry, which signed deals for 70% more office space.<br /><br />In 2018, Toronto-based Oxford Properties and a partner bought St. John’s Terminal on Manhattan’s west side for $700 million, with tech tenants in mind. The former freight terminal, which Google will occupy, has floor sizes of over 100,000 square feet, high ceilings and views of the Hudson River, enticing features for tech and ad tenants, Mr. Egan said.<br /><br />Oxford initially planned for a $2 billion development that would add abundant outdoor terraces and decks before landing Google. It is now redeveloping the property as the centerpiece of a campus in the Hudson Square neighborhood, where Google will ultimately occupy three buildings.<br /><br />—Konrad Putzier contributed to this article.<br />Write to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com<br /><br />Copyright ©2019 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Amazon has also considered leasing portions of the building, though the current state of talks couldn’t be determined. One person familiar with talks told the Journal that Amazon had considered paying more than $110 a square foot for the space.<br /><br />After a series of delays, the We Company closed on the historic Lord &amp; Taylor building in February for $850 million. It quickly tapped its chief architect Bjarke Ingels to preserve and renovate the roughly 600,000-square-foot landmarked building. According to the design he submitted, the lower floors were to remain retail spaces while the upper floors would be occupied by the We Company.<br /><br />The Journal report comes just months after the technology giant famously abandoned a plan to spend $2.5 billion on a new headquarters in Long Island City. Amazon has said it will continue to expand in New York City, where it has 5,000 employees. In June, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos spent&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;on three units at 212 Fifth Avenue.<br /><br />In addition to the Fifth Avenue building, Amazon has reportedly considered other office sites across the city, including the Farley Post Office.&nbsp;[WSJ]&nbsp;— Sylvia Varnham&nbsp;O’Regan<br />Tags:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;commercial,&nbsp;We Company,&nbsp;WeWork<br /><br />Short URL<br />http://bit.ly/2K53wWS

				Here&#039;s a summary of the jobs that were lost when the Amazon Queens deal fell through:<br /><br /><strong>Jobs</strong><br />Amazon would have reportedly generated $27.5 billion in city and state revenue over 25 years—a 9:1 ratio of revenue to subsidies. This arrangement was predicated on Amazon creating at least 25,000 jobs over the next decade—and up to 40,000—with an average salary of $150,000, the memorandum said. Another 1,300 jobs were in the pipeline for construction and some 107,000 in total direct and indirect jobs were anticipated, according to state estimates.<br /><br />Amazon, the city, and state initially planned to commit $5 million each toward workforce development. The deal also planned for a local nonprofit to open a training center on the HQ2 campus to mentor and recruit Long Island City locals, according to the city. A $10 million expansion of the city’s JobsPlus program into the Queensbridge Houses—the largest public housing complex in the country—was set to take shape. Additionally, the de Blasio administration planned to launch a $3-5 million program geared toward training NYCHA residents for careers in IT, cybersecurity, and web development.<br /><br />https://ny.curbed.com/2019/2/14/18225029/amazon-hq2-nyc-deal-canceled

				from techcrunch.com:<br /><br /><strong>Did New York lose anything with Amazon’s rejection? It’s complicated.<br /></strong><br />Jonathan Shieber@jshieber / 5 months ago<br /><br />Now that Amazon has said that it’s taking its ball and going home rather than deal with mean, pushy New Yorkers, outside observers are giving off the sense that the city (and its local politicians) are losing out for their recalcitrance.<br /><br />They’re wrong.<br /><br />New York City is running at about a 4.3 percent unemployment rate — higher than the national average of 3.9 percent, but a respectable number for jobs. Amazon’s promise of 25,000 jobs (high-paying jobs) may have reduced that number, but there’s no guarantee that those jobs would be filled by New Yorkers or Queens residents more specifically — and every indication that they would have gone to Amazon employees coming from somewhere else.<br /><br />Remember, Amazon employees were buying real estate in Queens before the deal was even announced.<br /><br />The response that New Yorkers are idiots for not giving Amazon (one of the most valuable companies in the world) billions in tax incentives to build an office tower in one of its boroughs is another sign of how the country privileges business interests above civic ones.<br /><br /><em>“new york city is such a valuable and desirable place to do business that literally no company on earth can resist coming here which is why we were forced to bribe amazon” is a curious argument for the governor to keep making<br /><br />— tc (@chillmage) February 14, 2019</em><br /><br />There are things that New York can do to boost its local economy without giving away the store to Amazon. There are incentives that could go to businesses already in New York to establish offices in Queens.<br /><br />More importantly, local Queens residents had legitimate concerns about how their neighborhood would be transformed by Amazon’s entrance into the borough.<br /><br />That’s not to say that local politicians may not have overplayed their hand. New York local politics is no stranger to graft, corruption, shakedowns or funny business (I wasn’t in the room for the negotiations), but it’s safe to say that “mistakes were made” on both sides.<br /><br />In the long run, Amazon would have been a benefit to the New York economy — and had the company’s executives made a good-faith effort to listen to the concerns of local residents, perhaps it could have come out looking like a winner.<br /><br />Because there are legitimate reasons to expect Amazon to be a benefit to the New York economy. As Noah Smith wrote in Bloomberg after the deal was announced:<br /><br /><em>Amazon will pay property tax on its new Long Island City offices. It will pay corporate tax — not just on its profits, but on its capital base. Its employees, especially highly paid ones, will pay the city’s personal income tax. Those taxes, of course, will be somewhat offset by the incentives that the city has promised the company — up to $2 billion, depending on how many people the company hires and how many facilities it builds. Those incentives were a wasteful way to attract corporate investment. But in the long run, the tax revenue New York City gets from HQ2 will probably far exceed the cost.<br /><br />And that’s not even taking into account Amazon’s effect on surrounding businesses and property values. Other technology companies will want to move to Queens now that Amazon is there. Their employees will spend their money locally, buying everything from lattes to MRIs. Some estimates place HQ2’s local economic boost at $17 billion a year. Even dividing that in half, and even assuming that the estimate is optimistic by a factor of 2 or 3, it seems likely that the economic benefit Queens reaps from HQ2 will quickly exceed the upfront cost — unlike, say, Wisconsin’s ill-advised Foxconn factory.<br /></em><br />Those benefits are true, but harder to quantify for a city like New York when taken against the impact those jobs and spending would have on the fabric of the local economy and the housing, transit and government services that new residents would demand.<br /><br />The livability crisis that’s currently afflicting Seattle and San Francisco is evidence of how cities need to be careful what they wish for when it comes to the explosive growth of technology companies (and the attendant wealth that comes with it) in their metropolises.<br /><br />In any event, the urban landscape of the U.S. is being radically reshaped by technology companies — creating cities that are haves and have-nots much as technology has bifurcated the national economy into digital haves and have nots.<br /><br />As Mark Muro and Robert Maxim of the Brookings Institute noted in this piece for US News and World Report:<br /><br /><em>Scholars have for years suspected that tech might alter the hierarchy of cities, given its bias toward skilled workers. More than a decade ago, researchers Paul Beaudry, Mark Doms and Ethan G. Lewis showed cities that adopted personal computers earliest and fastest saw their relative wages increase the quickest. Now, there is more evidence – including in our own work – that digital technologies are contributing heavily to the divergence of metro economies and the pull away of superstar cities like Boston and San Francisco from more ordinary ones, with painful impacts.</em><br /><br /><em>Recently, Princeton economist Elisa Giannone demonstrated that the divergence of cities’ wages since 1980 – after decades of convergence – reflects a mix of technology’s increased rewards to highly skilled tech workers and tech-driven industry clustering. Likewise, Brookings research has shown that a short list of highly digital, often coastal tech hubs is growing even more digital and pulling farther away from the pack on measures of growth and income. What we call the “digitization of everything” is in this way exacerbating the unevenness of America’s economic landscape.</em><br /><br /><br /><br />It’s far easier to make the case that Amazon’s decision to set up regional offices in Nashville will have far more positive outcomes for that city.<br /><br />But making American cities compete beauty pageant-style and bend over backwards to appease a multi-billion-dollar corporation is pretty gross — and a poor read of national sentiment around the roles that technology companies play in modern American society.<br /><br />As an example of how to expand in a city without invoking the wrath of the local community, observers need only look at how Google is expanding in New York. The company is planning to add 14,000 jobs in the city and has committed to $1 billion in spending to upgrade its West side campuses.<br /><br />Ostensibly, Google is expanding its presence in New York to compete for the talent it sees coming from the city (or coming to the city) and because New York is strategically important. Amazon’s decision to forsake New York means that it’s losing access to that talent and creating opportunities for other tech companies to come in and take its place — or for local companies to retain their edge.<br /><br />Here’s hoping that New York’s local tech community can supply Queens with those 25,000 jobs by building the next Amazon — and working with the community to do it.<br /><br />These days it seems like Democracy is a religion that’s replaced God with money. The pushback against Amazon shows that New York at least is adding civic responsibility into that equation somewhere.

				I have no doubt that New York will continue to attract high paying tech jobs.&nbsp; This is New York, after all.<br /><br />But if I were a kid in a Queens High School, my takeaway would be...Tech jobs bad. Sex worker jobs good.<br /><br />And because life can be where your dreams take you, dreams of sex work are being reinforced.

				<strong>Daily News</strong>:<br /><br />After Amazon left, silence: A public housing resident says politicians and others who claimed to care about jobs have done nothing since (https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-after-amazon-left-silence-20190729-msx7fbuqrfhhrfzo6er2s4vmim-story.html)<br /><br /><em>About six months ago, one of the biggest companies in the world was set to move in across the street from the public housing development where I live, bringing up to 40,000 quality jobs and billions in investment — investment in job training and workforce development, in infrastructure and in the lives of a community long overlooked by many of our elected leaders.<br /><br />Then, just like that, the deal was off, as politicians railed against a supposed government “giveaway” that wasn’t.

				I don&#039;t know why anyone would try to build anything here. Note that the Bridgemarket project under the Manhattan side of the 59th St bridge took 22 years from the day a hapless developer signed a lease until the project finally opened to the public. Endless battles between city agencies, state legislature, community board, judges etc. I can&#039;t imagine the expense.
