				Pardon my naivete, but what exactly goes on at Romanticos and Chibcha?<br /><br />They&#039;re not full-blown strip clubs, are they?<br /><br />Or do they just feature scantily-clad performers?<br /><br />I have NO interest in going there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just curious.

				The New York Times<br />Dancers for Hire at Queens Club Claim Wage Violations (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/nyregion/10flamingo.html)<br />By STEVEN GREENHOUSE<br />Published: April 10, 2008<br /><br />Every evening into the wee hours, lonely men slip into the dance clubs scattered under the el along Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. Inside, these men, most of them Hispanic immigrants, pay $2 for a dance in clubs with alluring names like Casanova and La Romantica.<br /><br />The busiest is the Flamingo Night Club, where, past the hulking bouncer, 50 for-hire dancers gyrate and two-step until 4 each morning, donning different outfits for Miniskirt Night, Pajama Night and Schoolgirl Night. On Bikini Night every Wednesday, the dance floor is jammed, the men pulling the dancers close, the lights dim, the reggaetÃ³n music blasting.<br /><br />For the men â€” construction workers, janitors, supermarket stockers â€” the Flamingo may be an antidote to loneliness, an opportunity to press against soft skin, but for many of the dancers, the club is an out-of-kilter world with bizarre rules. Several former Flamingo dancers plan to file a federal lawsuit against the club on Thursday, asserting that it repeatedly violated federal and state wage laws and cheated its dancers of hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br /><br />In interviews in Spanish, several former dancers said the owners often made them pay a $60 or $70 fine when they missed a day of work. Several complained of having to pay an $11 fee each day just to enter the club and an additional $10 if they arrived a half-hour late.<br /><br />They said that sometimes, after dancing from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., they had to attend meetings that lasted until 6 a.m. in which the owners held forth, calling some dancers â€œputaâ€ (whore) as well as ugly and fat. The dancersâ€™ most serious complaint was that the club never paid them a cent for their 45-hour workweeks.<br /><br />â€œI never received anything in wages,â€ said Patricia Gonzalez, a long-haired, leggy immigrant from the Dominican Republic who quit dancing at the Flamingo last June. â€œIn my three years there I must have paid thousands of dollars in fines. And I paid the daily fee of $11 to enter. What kind of job do you have to pay just to go to work?â€<br /><br />The lawsuit raises an intriguing question of law: whether the for-hire dancers were employees, who should have been paid wages for every hour they worked, or independent contractors who, as the Flamingoâ€™s owners assert, were merely renting space on the dance floor. <br /><br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

As per the &quot;filth&quot; element, I actually feel sorry for some of those that prostitute themselves, and even some of the &quot;clientele&quot; (those who have serious and very real sex addictions). What I consider the real evil to be is those that take advantage of others weaknesses and prey upon them.

				Interesting article about Chibcha/Oxes.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure whether to take this at face value... the owner may just be feigning innocence in order to gain advantage in a business dispute.&nbsp; But who knows.<br /><br /><br />Courthouse News Service<br />Monday, June 15, 2009&nbsp; &nbsp;Last Update: 4:20 AM PT<br />Strip Steak, Not Strip Club, Furious Owner Says (http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/06/15/Strip_Steak_Not_Strip_Club_Furious_Owner_Says.htm)<br />By ADAM KLASFELD <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;QUEENS (CN) - A businessman whose restaurant was honored as a pillar of the community by the New York City Council says he leased the place to someone on the condition that he would not turn it into a strip club, but that&#039;s just what the man did.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jorge Alarcon claims that the Queens Borough President and the New York City Council both praised his restaurant, Chibcha, when he ran it.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In December 2000 Queens declared a countywide &quot;Chibcha Restaurant Day&quot; for being &quot;one of the best restaurants in the borough&quot; whose &quot;fine cuisine and wonderful Latino entertainment has made [it] one of the special and unique attractions in Jackson Heights and Queens.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alarcon says New York City Council heaped more praise on Chibcha in July 2006, declaring that its &quot;support for nonprofit events, political and humanitarian campaigns&quot; made it an &quot;outstanding contribution to the residents of New York City.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Months later, Alarcon decided to retire. He leased his restaurant to Miguel Rojas, under the provisions that Roja&#039;s company, MDG Lounge Corp., would secure a liquor and cabaret license and under no circumstances would allow &quot;topless dancing or any other type of distasteful entertainment.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Rojas now does business under the name Oxe&#039;s,&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Alarcon just realized that this name spelled backwards is &#039;Sexo,&#039; which means &#039;sex&#039; in Spanish.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oxe&#039;s offers exotic dancing and pole dancing and advertises on flyers that it has &quot;the prettiest women in the tri-state area,&quot; Alarcon says. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He says the club has not paid him in full for the lease, and has violated its liquor and cabaret licenses.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alarcon seeks money owed and damage for breach of contract. He is represented by Greg Zucker with Westerman Ball and Ederer.<br />

				I&#039;m not familiar at all with what may be going on behind the scenes at the former ChibCha, but I can say that the place was once considered a reputable business.&nbsp; Many years back, it was known to be a classy supper/dinner club where patrons enjoyed good quality food and some dancing on special occasions.&nbsp; The ChibCha was very popular among the Hispanic community during holiday seasons and my family knew people that enjoyed the elegant service it provided.&nbsp; Whatever exists now is a sad shell of what used to be.

				Shanz, it is actually borderline illegal for their to be girls to dance with at Romanticos, because the do not possess the necessary licence to permit dancing of any sort, and what they do there is similar to a strip club.&nbsp; These types of establishment make Jackson Heights look sleazy.&nbsp;
