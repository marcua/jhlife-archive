					Hello parents, students and friends!<br /><br />Jackson Heights&#039; very own Renaissance Charter School plans to open a sister school! The new charter school called Renaissance Charter High School for Innovation hopes to open for the 2010-2011 school year, close to our original campus on 81st street and 37th avenue. We will be serving the high school students in District 30 which includes LIC, Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside, and of course Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Just like the original school, Renaissance Innovation will continue to develop leadership and provide amazing support and opportunities for its students. We have a three tiered educational model of core classroom instructions, portfolio-based annual individual projects and hands-on, experiential learning. <br /><br />As an alumni from the Renaissance Charter School, I can honestly say that a second school with the same model would highly benefit the young people in our neighborhood. The smaller class sizes that gives opportunity for individual attention as well as the dynamic programing really gave me and many other students an amazing educational experience. The current Renaissance Charter School (TRCS) is at capacity. We need this new high school to further provide an empowering education to the many other young people in our communities<br /><br />Renaissance Innovation plans to build and sustain a strong relationship with the neighborhood and the community. We would love to discuss our plans and hear your thoughts. Please feel free to personally email me or post your questions and comments up on this thread. If you would like more information or to meet with us, don&#039;t hesitate to ask.<br /><br /><strong>We are currently seeking the support of our community in the form of a letter. Any letter of support would be highly appreciated. If you or someone you know is a 7th grade parent, please get in touch with me personally for a petition that will added to our charter application. This is very important to our application as the current 7th grade students will be the eligible freshmen students in the opening year. This is not to register your child but to show your interest in the school.</strong><br /><br />Thank you for reading this <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />I hope to hear from everyone soon!<br />-Leanne<br /><br />Check out our website: <a href="http://renaissanceinnovation.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://renaissanceinnovation.org/</a><br />

					Hello Everyone! <br />I am currently a second year college student at Hunter College where I plan to pursue English, Women Studies and Film.

I am available to start immediately. <br />I am responsible, trustworthy and caring. I can also give referrals from my past work experiences upon request.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please let me know if you or someone you know is interested by sending me a personal message. <br /><br />Thank you!<br />-Leanne

					JHICON, thanks for the 123 Community Space shout out. I am part of the group that runs the silkscreening studio and are currently running a for youth by youth social justice and arts program. I HAVE ALL THE LOVE FOR THAT SPACE.<br /><br />I enjoy reading people&#039;s stories of what they would do to pass the time when they were younger and although most people think that its much different now because of technology, I have to disagree. I haven&#039;t been out of the public school system that long and back then we would hang out at Jahn&#039;s hoping that one day we could afford to buy the &quot;Kitchen Sink.&quot; People knew us there so much that we would sometimes request late passes written on their receipts. The local bowling alley and the BQE pool hall was a frequent hang out spot too.<br />&nbsp;<br />The reason I brought up this issue is because I AM part of the space that JHICON mentioned. Although I must admit that sustaining that place is really difficult, I know that if it can happen in BedStuy, why not in Jackson Heights? I have a deep concern about youth from the neighborhood feeling really out of place especially when Young Urban Professionals (otherwise called YUPPIES) start pouring in with the building of new condos and the rapid gentrification (i am crossing my fingers that this doesn&#039;t develop into a wild fire of criticisms now that i mentioned the G word). How can we maintain a sense of community when so many changes imposed by external forces are happening right in our backyards?<br /><br />I know young folks have a lot more to contribute if they are given the space and resources. I&#039;m sure if I had a place to go to make something creative and positive, I wouldn&#039;t be killing time in Dunkin Donuts or the diner. I wouldn&#039;t be tagging up on the street either...

					Hello Everyone!<br />I heard about this site a while ago and finally got the chance to visit it. I&#039;ve been reading past threads all night; I wish I knew about this sooner. Better later than never, right? I think it&#039;s amazing that people are communicating and building together through these forums!<br /><br />I grew up in the neighborhood and still live here. As I was reading through some of the boards, discussions about issues of graffiti, gentrification, building a creative community and schools really stood out to me. I remember needing a creative, open, community space when I attended middle and high school here in J. Heights. It was really difficult for me and my friends to find places to go to where we would feel safe and welcomed outside school. Most of the time we hung out on the side walk where we would have to deal with alienating glares from passersby who probably easily branded us as delinquents. I never really felt part of the Jackson Heights community when I was younger and so I traveled to Downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn to find spaces where I felt I could contribute something. <br /><br />I work with High School age folks and I still think this is a subject that needs attention in our community. Is there an existing community space in the neighborhood? I know there is an LGBTQ center on 37th ave. but I don&#039;t really know much about it and what the space is used for. Do we have any art centers or facilities available to the public? How can we support young folks with their initiatives? How can they take part in this communal dialogue?<br /><br />I hope people have some thoughts to share. I&#039;ve been raising the same questions with students, friends, teachers, community activists, etc from the neighborhood and it would be nice to hear what people think in this forum.<br /><br />peace<br />Ki-At
