					They have to have a public hearing with Landmarks and get approval before they can get DOB approval - interested parties should contact Landmarks, find out when the hearing is, and then organize yourselves to make a presentation of your case at the hearing. &nbsp;I think the idea that the predominant building height in the Landmark Business District is 2 stories or less might be an interesting argument to make, regardless of zoning.<br /><br />from the Landmarks website:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/faqs/faq_permit.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/faqs/faq_permit.shtml</a><br /><br /><br />Certificate of Appropriateness: A Certificate of Appropriateness (&quot;C of A&quot;) is needed when the proposed work requires a Department of Buildings permit and will affect significant protected architectural features. <strong>Additions, demolitions, <em>new construction</em>, and removal of architectural features such as stoops and cornices usually require a C of A.</strong> When the proposed work does not require a permit from the Department of Buildings, but has been denied a PMW by the Commission, the owner may apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness.<br />The Landmarks Law requires that a public hearing be held for each C of A application. At least six Commissioners must vote in favor of an application in order for it to be approved. The Landmarks Commission conducts C of A hearings every month, usually on the fourth Tuesday of the month. Notice of each Landmarks Commission hearing is published in the City Record for ten days before the hearing, and Community Boards are notified of applications affecting properties within their districts.<br />At the hearing, the applicant is given the opportunity to explain why he or she believes that the application should be approved. The public may also comment on the proposed work. The applicant and the public may also submit written statements before the hearing.<br />In many cases, the Commissioners discuss and vote on a C of A application on the same day that the public hearing is held. Sometimes, however, they request additional information about the proposal before voting. After the public hearing is closed, the applicant and the public may submit additional written statements about the proposal up until the time when the Commissioners vote on the application.<br /><br /><br />Usually the Commissioners will make a decision on a C of A application based on &quot;presentation&quot; or &quot;design development&quot; drawings of a proposed project. After the Commissioners vote to approve an application, the applicant may be required to submit construction drawings in order for the approval to become final. The actual C of A permit is not issued until the staff has reviewed the final construction drawings to make sure that the final plans are consistent with the proposal approved by the Commissioners.<br /><br />

					You could try going online to see if there are any historical photos of your building.<br />Somewhere on NYC.gov is a page where you can request historic photos of your address - there was a city-wide photographic survey done in the early 1940&#039;s (I think) and those records are available somewhere in one of the city offices in downtown Manhattan.<br />Also, since our neighborhood was landmarked pretty recently, you might be off the hook in terms of being completely historically accurate in what you can do with your windows.&nbsp; I *THINK* that if the building had metal windows put in pre-Landmarks, that you wouldn&#039;t have to revert back to wood.<br />And I agree with artfldodger - if your contractor has that much trouble with Landmarks, they are doing something wrong.<br />Good luck - there are many people on JHLife who are excellent resources on this sort of thing - you are in good hands!

					I get the feeling that you are looking for some sort of tacit approval on this - I can&#039;t give you that, but I am writing this with no judgment and in the spirit of friendly advice from experience....<br /><br />Why do you think that Landmarks will take more time?&nbsp; If you follow their regulations and select windows accordingly, it shouldn&#039;t take long to get their approval.&nbsp; I imagine that in this time of careful spending by co-ops, their paperwork load is lighter than it used to be and your application would get to the top of the pile pretty quickly.&nbsp; I was on my building&#039;s board recently and we had no problem getting approvals in a timely fashion when we proposed things that were in accordance with their regs.<br /><br />If you do not follow their regulations and install non-conforming windows, and are then cited for not following their rules, you will be on the hook for the penalty fee AND the cost of installing the right windows.&nbsp; (this happened to my building a while ago when they made some roof repairs and used materials that were non-conforming - they ended up having to put in the right materials in the end and thus paid for the project twice!) So why bother putting in windows that you know are not approved and risk spending more of your co-op&#039;s money than you need to?&nbsp; Windows are not a cheap item and I think you would be pennywise and pound-foolish to try to do this project in a roundabout way.<br /><br />I know you raise concerns about saving time, but it sounds like the co-op has already waited a long time to do this - in the long run, and extra month or so probably won&#039;t make a huge difference.<br /><br />

					Madalyn (and everyone else),<br /><br />Remember that the world cup is in South Africa this year, so with the time difference, the latest match each day will start at 2:30pm. &nbsp;Who knows how long the victory celebrations will last, but they&#039;ll be starting early at least.<br /><br />We&#039;re looking forward to the hoopla - as has been said, it only occurs once every four years and it&#039;s fun! &nbsp;We&#039;re not doing anything officially at E77, but rest assured that Afzal will have the matches on in some capacity a lot of the time...<br />

					This sounds so promising!&nbsp; I&#039;m delighted to hear that the owners are putting some money into renovations and that they are open to working with local filmmakers.&nbsp; Hopefully this means that the Jackson Heights Film Festival will have a place to call home sometime in the near future.

					Veggie Monster is basically a deli/health food shop that carries organic food - they have small freezer, refrigerator, deli and produce sections and another section of natural shampoos, lotions, vitamins, etc. &nbsp;They carry the usual suspects - Annies, Dr. Praegers, Organic Valley, a couple of varieties of soy ice cream and then some higher-end ice creams and so on.<br /><br />I like it because the people who run the shop are pleasant, it is always well-stocked and clean. &nbsp;Prices are slightly high, but not unlike what you typically see at a deli or organic shop.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it is worth the schlep from JH, but I take the LIRR in from Penn Station, so it is convenient when I am on my way home. &nbsp;

					Julie here from Espresso 77...<br />I have been holding off jumping into this discussion, but this last comment, insinuating some sort of quid pro quo, is completely wrong and frankly, quite hurtful.<br />Leitrim, if you have some issue with how we prepare tea, my husband and co-owner is at the shop today and most days, and is happy to talk with you about it.&nbsp; We are not a specialist tea shop and have never claimed to be - there are amazing places in NYC that do a great job with tea and I&#039;m sure they are incredibly detailed in how they prepare it.&nbsp; We have picked out the best tea that fits the price points that our customers are comfortable with and with the exception of your criticisms, the tea has found a happy audience.&nbsp; But like I said, we are very happy to talk with our customers and to try to find a way to meet your needs.&nbsp; Please feel free to email me directly at <a href="mailto:info@espresso77.com" class="bbc_email">info@espresso77.com</a> to discuss further.<br />

					Not in JH, but there is also a new crepe place set to open in Woodside (61st Street, just south of Roosevelt, next to the excellent Veggie Monster shop) - walked by there yesterday and looks like it will be maybe be a week or so.
