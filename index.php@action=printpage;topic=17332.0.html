				I just discovered a really delicious Trader Joe&#039;s frozen pizza that has a crust made of cauliflower. I also am a big fan of the salad mix that has shredded broccoli, kale, seeds and dried cherries. It comes in a bag in the salad section. Curious to know anyone else&#039;s favorites to add to my list of things to try.

				Their little frozen peas are very good, and the frozen blueberries I keep on hand for the times of dearth for fresh ones are very acceptable, both better price than the local supermarkets.<br /><br />The raspberry-dark chocolate batons.<br /><br />Their own brand triple-crème brie.<br /><br />One of the very few places that sells heavy cream that&#039;s pasteurized but not ultra - I use it to make crème fraiche.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I like to buy walnuts and other nuts at Trader Joe&#039;s because the price is usually lower than at your average supermarket.&nbsp; Also, I like TJ&#039;s packaged almond meal.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for almond meal chocolate chip cookies!

				Their imported EV olive oil and ghee are both priced well. The individual serving-size goat cheeses are handy for packing in lunches. There&#039;s a bottled peanut dressing in the produce section that when poured over pasta and chilled tastes like cold sesame noodles. In the frozen veggies section, the roasted potatoes with onions and peppers are great for with eggs for breakfast. TJ brand greek yogurt tastes just like FAGE, for less $. Dried mango is a nice, all natural snack. And the coffee beans are well-priced. Wish we had a TJs closer by.

				I am a cheese fan and I love Trader Joe’s Cambozola Triple Cream Soft Ripened Blue Cheese especially with their TJ&#039;s fig and olive crisps. https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/4209<br /><br />(During the holidays they also do a limited release of pistachio and pomegranate crisps. Rumor has it they may release these year round. Dying to try them...) <br /><br />Also they sell the awesome VT cheesemonger Jasper Hill products at great prices. Another soft cheese recommendation: We loved the JH Harbison as a more affordable substitute for Rush Creek reserve by Upland cheese. <br /><br />https://www.jasperhillfarm.com/harbison<br /><br />More cheese ideas here: https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/best-trader-joes-cheese<br /><br />

				Jasper Hill cheeses are wonderful. our Greenmarket purveyor, Consider Bardwell, is also Vermont based and darn good. their &quot;Experience&quot; cheese, not available regularly, is my favorite. lots of funk.<br /><br />Foodtown, often bashed here lately, has really improved its cheese counter. lots of Spanish items at prices competitive with other cheesemongers. they also have a few British things priced at the low end -- we had a really good Stilton the other day, and i love Wesleydale, a cheddar with fruit. small pieces of that are under $5.

				Just discovered the jalopeno sauce as well and love it!&nbsp; I buy nuts and froz vegs at TJs - good value and quality.&nbsp; I bought a ham there for Easter and it was great!&nbsp; I also find they have low sodium items that I can&#039;t find elsewhere - snacks and salsa.&nbsp; I like the frozen appetizers - pigs in a blanket, etc.&nbsp; The flourless chocolate cake is wonderful.&nbsp; I buy produce there - I thinks it&#039;s better quality than most of the places in JH excluding the farmer&#039;s market and I like their cheese selection.&nbsp; I use the almond meal and other specialty flours from there and I like their toiletries too. I usually buy their frozen chicken and fish to keep on hand. The organic nut butters are a great deal too. Not a huge fan of a lot of their frozen meals - I find them hit and miss.&nbsp; I love their 0% greek yogurt - it is the sourest yogurt! and better than any other variety I&#039;ve had including fage.

				I recently discovered TJ&#039;s Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate. I&#039;ve been mixing it with TJ&#039;s Coconut Beverage for a quick iced coffee fix. That said, there was a bit of trial and error in measuring the right amount of concentrate to use. It all depends on how strong you like your coffee.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/y5N0piO.jpg)

				I just got some Yemeni/Middle Eastern Zhoug sauce yesterday. It&#039;s tasty but really spicy, so you have to like spice.<br /><br />(https://www.traderjoes.com/TJ_CMS_Content/Images/Digin/Uploads/59192-zhoug-sauce.jpg)<br /><br />From TJ site:<br /><br />Zhoug (pronounced ZOOg) likely originated in Yemen, and is now popular throughout the Middle East. It’s a cilantro-based sauce/condiment that’s been likened to “Middle Eastern pesto,” but we think that description shortchanges the originality of this spicy, fragrant, fabulously flavorful culinary creation.<br /><br />It’s a sauce that’s taking the internet by storm – from food blogs to social media feeds, Zhoug is having its moment in the digital sun. And it&#039;s about to have its moment in our stores!<br /><br />Trader Joe’s Zhoug Sauce comes to us from a California vendor well-versed in the art and science of Middle Eastern foods. Here, they’ve put together a very straightforward collection of ingredients – cilantro, canola oil, jalapeño peppers, chile flakes, garlic, cardamom, sea salt, and cumin seeds – to create a sauce/dip/spread/condiment that bursts with vibrant flavor and color.<br /><br />We call it “very spicy” on our label, and some will find it “very spicy.” Those more into spicy foods may find it only moderately spicy. Everyone who tries it will be impressed by how the flavor of every ingredient comes through, even as the flavors blend beautifully into the finished product.<br /><br />Try Zhoug as a dip for vegetable crudités or pita (bread or chips). It makes a delicious sandwich spread, a super sauce for pasta (here’s where it’s like pesto), and a vibrant addition to a plate of meat or fish. It’s traditionally served alongside hummus and falafel, and we’re all for sticking to this tradition. Keeping to our tradition of value, we’re selling each eight ounce tub for $2.99, every day. You’ll find it in our refrigerated case.

				From the New York Times Wirecutter:<br />https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/our-favorite-things-trader-joes/<br /><br />Having just recently visited the Trader Joe&#039;s at LIC/Court Square, I was surprised at how small that location is.

				Unlike Wegman&#039;s and Whole Foods, which require big box sized footprints in order to open their doors, Trader Joe&#039;s can get by with a normal supermarket sized space. Roosevelt Parc offers that if you combine the ground floor space with the basement (both vacant), which add up to about 16,000 sq. ft.
