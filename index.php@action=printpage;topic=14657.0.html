				Hi, I&#039;m looking for meetup groups and resources in the neighborhood geared towards new parents. I know there&#039;s an occasional dad meetup, but I haven&#039;t come across any new mommy groups, baby classes, or other related community groups/events. The QueensMamas site looks about 2 years out of date. Hoping to get connected and looking for any resources that might be of help. Thank you!

				If you haven&#039;t found them yet, here are a few:<br /><br />https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/jhfamilies/info<br />(Besides tons of free/cheap hand-me-downs, there are meetups for moms/parents based on season and year of your child&#039;s birth, I think mostly through connected listservs but my wife uses it so I don&#039;t know as much about it as she does)<br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/JHmom/<br />(a facebook group just for JH moms)<br />

				I hope you connected with the new parents groups through Yahoo, Facebook &amp; Googlegroups! There are also many activities in the neighborhood for babies and toddlers like Queens Library kids&#039; programs (comprehensive list @ http://m.queenslibrary.org/events/?filters=ev_age:Kids), NYSci Corona&#039;s &quot;PreSchool Place&quot; (which has infant section), Fiesta Kids indoor playground on Roosevelt Ave (also with separate toddler section), plus local Jackson Heights programs like Kids Music Together, Bilingual Sprouts, MKD Karate, and Superkickers. There&#039;s also a Gymboree one subway stop away in Forest Hills. Fortunately JH station &amp; FH both have elevators, if you use stroller.<br /><br />Ocasionally Mimi for Me yoga studio on 37th Ave offers Mommy &amp; Me post natal yoga too. If you want to venture outside the area with your little one, there are excellent post natal Mommy &amp; Me Pilates workshops on E14th St in Manhattan, and also in Wmsburg Bklyn. They&#039;re not only good workouts, but a nice way to meet other parents with children similar in age.
