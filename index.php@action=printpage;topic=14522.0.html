				Greetings, all -- I have been looking in vain for some relatives that lived in JH but have come up with dead ends in my searching, so I thought I&#039;d take a shot in the dark and post here.<br /><br />The quick backstory is that my paternal grandfather (originally from Scotland) had some secrets that none of us were aware of until we stumbled upon a treasure trove of material indicating that he had a brother who lived at <strong><em>3136 77th Street </em></strong> in Jackson Heights in the 1940s.&nbsp; Of course, I presume the brother himself is long gone, but he had two daughters (aged 19 and 22 at the time) and so I was hoping to find any shred of evidence of their existence beyond what I already have -- which is a Draft Registration Card and the 1940 Census data.<br /><br />They cool thing about the 1940 census data is that they had randomly selected 1 out of every 20 people and questioned them a little more in detail, and the man&#039;s wife was one of these.&nbsp; But this is all I have to go on -- the fact that they had two girls makes it much harder to search because of possible future married names; I thought I&#039;d maybe try to search through yearbooks of the surrounding schools during that time but there are tons of schools in that area, and that still wouldn&#039;t reveal anything about their future names or whereabouts.&nbsp; <br /><br />The parents are Andrew McKee and Elizabeth McKee originally from Dailly Scotland; lived at 3136 77th Street around 1940, Andrew was employed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the daughters, Ellen McKee (22) and Agnes McKee (19) were &quot;clerks&quot; at &quot;Towel Supply&quot; and &quot;Beverage Co&quot; respectively (as the census puts it) ...&nbsp; Of course, they very well could have gone back to Scotland not long after then, but if they happened to stick around the JH/Queens area and have children, that&#039;d be fascinating; I just don&#039;t know how to search any further based on what I have....<br /><br />So!&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas that could help me look deeper into the whereabouts of these people, that would be extraordinary.&nbsp; Here is the fellow&#039;s draft card:<br /><br />(http://www.digitaldfw.com/andrewmckee.jpg)<br /><br />And the Census data:<br /><br />(http://www.digitaldfw.com/census1940-andrewedit.jpg)<br /><br />Any sort of direction anyone can point me would surely be appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks much<br />lobster
