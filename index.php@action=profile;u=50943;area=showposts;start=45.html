					&quot;A man remains on the loose after he opened fire on cops in Astoria and crashed his truck before fleeing on foot Thursday — in an incident that forced the shutdown of the Queensboro Bridge.<br /><br />The man was driving a stolen pickup truck with Florida plates when he was stopped at Broadway and Crescent Street at around 8:50 p.m., law-enforcement sources said.<br /><br />He fired one shot at the cops — but missed — before taking off and clipping at least one officer with the truck as he sped away, a source said.<br /><br />The officers opened fire on the vehicle, according to police, and the driver made it only about a half- mile before crashing the black Ford F-150 at 37th Avenue and 24th Street and running away, a source said.<br /><br />Patrons at a local bar were startled when the gunshots rang out.<br /><br />“We sit down at the outside tables and then — boom!” said Paul Guidone, 27, who was at The Strand on Broadway. “Everyone jumped and ran inside.”<br /><br />Police in Manhattan’s 19th Precinct closed down the bridge in both directions for about 30 minutes to make sure the shooter did not flee Queens, as officers canvassed the area around the shooting.<br /><br />Police recovered a .38 caliber handgun in the abandoned pickup truck, according to a source.<br /><br />The vehicle was stolen just two days ago in West Palm Beach, according to a law-enforcement source.<br /><br />Police sources said that the vehicle matched the description of a truck linked to an earlier robbery.<br /><br />At around 4:20 p.m., a person matching the description of the suspect stole a 49-year-old woman’s purse from her shoulder in East Elmhurst, cops said.<br /><br />The victim chased the man down to a pickup truck with Florida plates that also fit the description of the vehicle and attempted to reclaim her purse before the thief drove away.<br /><br />The woman was dragged for a few feet as she tried to cling to the vehicle but eventually let go, causing minor injuries.<br /><br />The man was still on the run this morning as helicopters were deployed.<br /><br />A police source said that cops were looking for an older white man, with a heavy build, who stands around 6-feet tall and weighs about 225 pounds.<br /><br />The suspect was described as being about 50 to 60 years old, and wearing glasses. He was said to have had short-cropped salt and pepper hair.<br /><br />Two officers were taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan with minor injuries. They were listed in stable condition.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queensboro_incident_bridge_loose_YVd8nFf1pGHrRlBQGu2ucK" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queensboro_incident_bridge_loose_YVd8nFf1pGHrRlBQGu2ucK</a><br /><br />and also: <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216035" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9216035</a><br /><br />

					I walked by there this evening not too long ago, and it is clearly a space people would like to have. I think it&#039;s a universal urge to want to congregate, people watch, etc. <br /><br />Also, I fear subjecting myself to ridicule by admitting that I have never seen anyone using or selling drugs, and I walk by there daily, throughout all hours of the day, including around midnight. It&#039;s usually groups of men hanging out, chatting, and so on. <br /><br />I wonder if benches--instead of tables--might be a better solution, especially because the space is sandwiched between two rows of businesses. The issues surrounding Diversity Plaza seem to mirror other similar places: it&#039;s smack in the middle of businesses, and it&#039;s all concrete. All of the spaces I&#039;ve come across and lived close to in Brooklyn weren&#039;t like Diversity Plaza. In my opinion, it&#039;s an odd place to choose as a communal space.

					I liked everyone&#039;s ideas, which resonated with my own:<br /><br />--Grass where one can sit<br /><br />--A tiny kiosk with tables. Great during the week, great during farmer&#039;s market<br /><br />--Pretty and fragrant flowers and plants (for the aesthetic appeal)<br /><br />--My own wish would be to have a mobile/tiny library there as well, if it can be tucked into a designated space. Maybe close to a gigantic tree which offers ample shade. It can carry books for both children and adults. Very convenient, nice objective. <br /><br />I like Matt&#039;s suggestion of having a solar-powered, eco-friendly park.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want a fountain if that takes away from having more green grass space.&nbsp; <br /><br />

					Hi Shelby,<br /><br />Thanks for the welcome!<br /><br />Yes, I am familiar with Espresso (amongst the many other great cafes) and their events. <br /><br />As for being interested in Spanish cheese, I am always down for trying something new, so I will definitely check out the store you indicated.<br /><br />I live here too:<br /><br />The description of Leo’s Latticini&#039;s offerings that you gave made my heart skip a beat there. I&#039;m definitely going to try that place. The mention of cannolis, southern Italian cheeses, and fresh pastas alone sold me on the spot.<br /><br />fodoherty:<br /><br />Thank you to both you and Shelby for informing me of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group--never heard of it, I&#039;ll look into it.

					I love the cat, and I love the store. Its offerings save me from making trips to Astoria or Manhattan. Best of all, I can&#039;t believe I was able to find refrigerated cubes of yeast as one would in Europe--all I&#039;ve ever come across here in the US is packets of powdered yeast.

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />I moved to JH a few months ago from Brooklyn, and I&#039;m enjoying it so far. Never before have I lived in a place where practically all four corners of the globe are within walking distance of one another. The strong artist presence was a wonderful surprise too, as I am a lover of the arts myself. And I was beside myself when I stumbled upon the stationary store on 37th. The only things I find myself wanting are green space in the form of parks and a nice bookstore that doesn&#039;t involve a trek. But that&#039;s what the subway is there for.<br /><br />I do have a couple of questions that perhaps someone can answer here:<br /><br />1. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to meet people/make friends in this area? I know there are artist groups, but I&#039;m not really an artist myself. I&#039;ve tried bars, but I&#039;m finding that that&#039;s not really my scene. I searched for Meetup groups, and there aren&#039;t any for this area. <br /><br />2. Are there any stores in JH besides Lemon Farm that carry imported Italian cheeses like gorgonzola and taleggio? I tried the Italian shop on 37th, but they didn&#039;t have what I was looking for. <br /><br />Any feedback will be appreciated!
