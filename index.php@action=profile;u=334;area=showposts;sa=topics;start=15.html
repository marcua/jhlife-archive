					We&#039;re too familiar with bed bugs in my building, but lately we&#039;ve seen another insect that&#039;s eating my wife. (Luckily they don&#039;t like me.)<br /><br />The bites look like those of a mosquito but each bite gets worse - itchier - with time. But we don&#039;t see any mosquitoes. At least not the obvious type. We do see tiny - fruit fly size - flying bugs. <br /><br />Anyone else getting odd bites?<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt

					I&#039;m looking for someone that can assist with the care of my 87 year old mother-in-law. She is currently in a hospital but is expected out any day. She had lived independently in her apartment on 75th Street off 37th Avenue, until June, but will need assistance with bathing and personal hygiene until rehab does its job and she is again fully ambulatory.

					Sometime soon, perhaps as soon as 2012, the .nyc TLD will arrive and with it the JacksonHeights.nyc domain name. <br /><br />[Background: Familiar TLDs or Top Level Domains are .com, .org, .edu, and .gov.&nbsp; Since 1993 the U.S. government and a California not-for-profit, ICANN, have been working to develop a process to issue additional TLDs. That process is expected to come to fruition in 2012 with the issuance of several hundred new TLDs, including city TLDs such as .paris, .berlin, .bcn (Barcelona) and .nyc.]<br /><br />The .nyc TLD will provide a full set of domain names that might be seen as the city&#039;s new digital infrastructure.&nbsp; Amongst the name-sets to be assigned will be neighborhood names, 350 by the latest calculation - JacksonHeights.nyc, Corona.nyc, GreenwichVillage.nyc, etc. The hope of Connecting.nyc Inc., the not for profit created to advocate for the development of .nyc as a public interest resource, is that these neighborhood domain names will be used to serve the needs of the neighborhoods they describe. (It would be quite disappointing to see Corona.nyc selling beer rather than serving the information needs of the neighborhoods 50,000 residents. We view the neighborhood names as amongst the most important name-sets to become available, with the hope that they provide quality local communication that traditionally been missing in New York City.<br /><br />[Background: I attended college in Terre Haute, Indiana where 2 TV stations, 8 radio stations, and a daily newspaper served the information and communication needs of the city&#039;s 100,000 residents.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has perhaps 75,000 residents and not a single daily newspaper, TV or radio station to serve local needs. ]<br /><br />Recently Connecting.nyc Inc., Wikimedia New York City (an affiliate of the organization that runs Wikipedia), and the Internet Society&#039;s New York Chapter initiated an experiment to see how the neighborhood names might function as wikis - that is, Wikipedia-like. That effort is using the <a href="http://NYCwiki.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">NYCwiki.org</a> domain name. It began in June and this week it&#039;s first focused neighborhood development effort is Jackson Heights. The hope is that a wiki, souped up with collaboration tools, will enable neighborhood residents to better communicate, address local issues, and create a more livable neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />[Background: Connecting.nyc Inc. evolved from an Internet Empowerment Resolution Queens Community Board 3 passed in April 2001. The undersigned introduced the Resolution and founded Connecting.nyc Inc. in 2006. See a long story on this via a Founder&#039;s Statement - <a href="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/founder-s-statement" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.coactivate.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/founder-s-statement</a> - on Connecting.nyc Inc.&#039;s wiki.&nbsp; As the project initiator I volunteered Jackson Heights to be the first neighborhood to receive a focused development, meaning that all hands will focus on making progress with Jackson Heights wiki this week. Next week Harlem will be the focused neighborhood. Also, in a few weeks Wikimedia will host a wiki training session here in Jackson Heights.]<br /><br />I&#039;m writing tonight to invite JacksonHeightsLife (JHL) users to contribute to our effort. This will involve making a lot of mistakes as we stumble to develop a neighborhood wiki - perhaps the first. In 2012, if we&#039;ve made something worthwhile, it will be ported to JacksonHeights.nyc - as will 350 other city neighborhoods being developed on the <a href="http://NYCwiki.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">NYCwiki.org</a> site. <br /><br />That raises the question of the impact the Jackson Heights wiki has on those digital (and other) media that preceded it - such as JacksonHeightsLife.com. I&#039;m uncertain. But I know the dog park would not be there were it not for JHL and we&#039;re looking to meliorate negatives. We&#039;ve put a link on NYCwiki.org to JHL and are looking for ways to better support all local media. But we live in a period of time-poverty and something is likely to suffer. <br /><br />This will lead some to say - &quot;Hey, don&#039;t rock the boat, just don&#039;t use .nyc, let it sit on the shelf.&quot;&nbsp; But .paris and .berlin are coming online and not having a city TLD would be like not having street signs, we&#039;d be on the wrong side of a new digital divide.<br /><br />&quot;Well, why not just leave the neighborhood names idle?&quot; If we&#039;re to effectively govern ourselves we need a place to meet and discuss the issues of the day. Democracy requires a conversation and neighborhood names will enable great grassroots action. They provide the best opportunity I&#039;ve seen in my life to empower the grassroots. While this might seem frightening to some, we&#039;re of the opinion that it&#039;s an all boats rise opportunity. <br /><br />So let this be an invitation to take a look at <a href="http://nycwiki.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nycwiki.org</a>&nbsp; and help develop what could be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br /><a href="mailto:Toml@communisphere.com" class="bbc_email">Toml@communisphere.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />P.S. There&#039;s a governance issue I&#039;ve not touched on here - who controls JacksonHeights.nyc.&nbsp; Our proposal is that a Neighborhood Trust be set up to oversee the names, making sure that Corona.nyc serves local residents and not the beer company. But a local group will set local standards within the Trust&#039;s guidelines.&nbsp; See our dotNeighborhood pages - <a href="http://bit.ly/d9lily" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/d9lily</a> - for more on the topic.&nbsp; And see our Domain Name Allocation Plan -&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/an6Hzl" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/an6Hzl</a> - for other name-sets.<br /><br />&nbsp;

					The following is a blast about a home grown effort that originated here in Jackson Hts. With success, we&#039;ll have access to the .nyc TLD, as described below. What good does that do for the neighborhood, the city, and each of us? Go to <a href="http://www.connectingnyc.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.connectingnyc.org</a> to connect with the effort.<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<hr /><br />Top level domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .edu, and .gov are crucial markers in our online world, but there are not enough of them to distinguish the various ways in which we interact on the web. One of the clearest, most pressing requirements is for TLDs that serve the needs of cities. To that end, in April 2007, the not-for-profit Connecting.nyc Inc. was created to prepare an Internet space for New York City&#039;s networked future <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/objectives" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">through advocacy, research, and education</a>. <br /><br />Step one is to acquire the .nyc TLD. That opportunity should arise within the next year with the path detailed in our <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/multi-sector-nonprofit-entity" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Acquisition Campaign</a>. Itâ€™s a difficult but doable task.<br /><br />The far more challenging task is to develop .nyc as an organizing force to empower New York City&#039;s residents, institutions, and businesses to better connect with one another and the world. This becomes ever more important as other cities (.berlin and .paris) acquire TLDs, with the cityâ€™s growing invisibility in an Internet dominated by the .com TLD, and with our â€œfindabilityâ€ increasingly dependent on the interests of search engine operators. To be the master of its future, New York City needs its own space on the Internet. <br /><br />Over the past year weâ€™ve developed several resources to support our acquisition and development campaigns. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with Dr. Michael Gurstein on a <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/towards-city-tlds-in-the-public-interest" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">white paper</a> illuminating the public interest benefits of city-TLDs, and our <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/project-home" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">community wiki</a> and <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/blog/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">blog</a> provide New Yorkers with the opportunity to connect with our effort and help shape their city&#039;s future. Links here connect to several of the wiki&#039;s pages.<br /><br />With the .nyc TLD a vital civic resource, we urge public participation in our planning processes and invite you to explore and add your thoughts to the wiki. Key wiki pages include those for our <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/board-of-directors" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Governance</a>, <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/community-and-justice" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Community and Justice Goals</a>, and a <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/nyc-faq" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.<br /><br />You can help in several other ways: make a financial or equipment contribution (we need a projector yesterday!), or by emailing your ideas, questions, and suggestions to me. This Sunday (March 2) you can join us in imagining New York City&#039;s Internet space at the <a href="http://nycgrassrootsmedia.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Grassroots Media Conference</a> at Hunter College. Iâ€™ll be making a presentation entitled â€œA Platform for Community Media.â€<br /><br />[NOTE: Connecting.nyc Inc. is a New York State not-for-profit corporation that is registered with the New York State Charities Bureau and has submitted application for the IRS&#039;s 501(c)(3) tax exemption approval.]<br /><br />Thank you for your attention.<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt, Founder and Acting Director<br /><br />Connecting.nyc Inc<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.connectingnyc.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Web</a>&nbsp; --&nbsp; <a href="http://www.connectingnyc.openplans.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Wiki</a>&nbsp; --&nbsp; <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/campaign-for.nyc/blog/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Blog</a><br />Box 1027, Jackson Hts., NYC <br /><a href="mailto:TomL@communisphere.com" class="bbc_email">TomL@communisphere.com</a><br /><br />718 639 4222<br />
