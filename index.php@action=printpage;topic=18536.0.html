				Does anyone know which building this is?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to place it.&nbsp; The sale price actually seems a bit high for a 1-bedroom, but I&#039;m guessing the square footage is also high and the renovation looks nice from the one picture.&nbsp; I would love to see the whole apartment.&nbsp; The table and chairs are lovely and the sideboard is to die for.&nbsp;

				Good call! <br /><br />It&#039;s specifically Belvedere West on 84th since they have the same white trellis and fallout shelter sign. ;) <br /><br />And here it is. It was totally reno-ed and move in ready. Worth every penny! Well done! Welcome to the neighborhood gentlemen!!! https://streeteasy.com/sale/1323195

				It&#039;s funny that the article doesn&#039;t even mention the building&#039;s garden, which I think is a big selling point. Maybe not everyone cares about having a garden, though.

				I am just rereading this article. Can someone tell me more about this &quot;ongoing utility work&quot; in the area (or building) that currently prevents them from using their gas stove? Anyone from that complex have any info to share? I hope this gets resolved quickly. It&#039;s got to be tough to love cooking and eating and not get full use of that nice, spacious new kitchen!
