				Just a few blocks from Jackson Heights on the other side of Roosevelt Avenue. Which is worse: the gender reveal megafire, or the wedding Covid super-cluster?<br /><br />https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/sheriffs-bust-illicit-indoor-wedding-in-queens-with-nearly-300-guests/2637694/

				Why other countries&#039; citizens can follow simple social rules, yet Americans are such defiant children? Following traditional customs over public health is very selfish and egocentric. There&#039;s always a bad seed that messes things up for everyone. That catering hall business should be shut down for the next 6 months.

				This is a little further away but still in Queens (Flushing). <br /><br />NYC sheriff shuts down karaoke bar for COVID-19 violations (https://nypost.com/2020/09/27/nyc-sheriff-shuts-down-another-karaoke-bar-for-covid-19-violations/)<br /><br />excerpt:<br />The city sheriff’s office pulled the plug on a Queens karaoke joint after catching nearly 200 people partying early Sunday morning, authorities said.<br /><br />Deputies arrived at Home Run KTV on Kissena Boulevard in Flushing just after midnight to find approximately 192 people reveling in the facility’s karaoke rooms, in violation of the city’s coronavirus laws.<br /><br />Inside authorities found patrons boozing, smoking, not wearing masks and not maintaining safe social distance, the city said.
