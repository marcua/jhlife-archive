					A few months ago my friend reached out for help with his cousin&#039;s cat BouBou. The cousin was nearing the birth of her first child and was about to give BouBou to a shelter. I took him in, hoping that he could get along with my boy Danny. Sadly, despite all of the videos and tricks and advice I have been given and tried, the two are still deeply at odds, and BouBou has lived in fear. I contacted his original owners and they had no interest in taking him back.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /><br /><br />BouBou is sweet and loving, loves to sit and cuddle, but should <span class="bbc_u">definitely</span> be placed in a one-cat home. He would be great for anyone looking for a mellow guy who just wants some cuddles and occasional chin rubs. He has had all of his shots (I was told when I took him in) and has been healthy and well. I can provide supplies and a carrier to the right person who is looking to add some cat love to their life! I&#039;m including a photo below. PM me if you are interested. Thanks!

					I understand that car owners do not own the space beneath them, but I have problems when that space is used to provide profit for private industry. Yes, some people will benefit, people who pay costs and fees to the private car rental service because they choose to use their service instead of public buses or trains. Car sharing rentals are already available at the public garages on 37th Ave and on 88th and Northern at that new garage. I fail to see how displacing current car owners to give space to a private industry that provides a negligible, duplicative, benefit will decrease cars circling for spots. Perhaps it would make sense if the neighborhood was transient enough to have enough new people constantly moving in that might choose to not move with a car on a regular basis. I&#039;m not sure that JH is at that spot. Of the 14 spots on the pilot survey, 10 are areas that are rapidly gentrifying. This seems to encourage that process and churn.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see this service as serving the same public good as Citibike, which I feel is a justifiable yield of space. It feels like a giveaway of a public good. While drivers do not own the street they park on, their taxes pay for it. Why should they be excluded from the use of that space for the benefit of a private company?&nbsp; I had a similar complaint when my street was blocked off for filming in Astoria 25 weeks out of the year to benefit a school that rented out its space to every TV show and movie that needed school interiors (St John&#039;s Prep). It was infuriating and of no benefit to the people who had to put up with the lights, people, and trucks belching exhaust in our windows all day. Someone got paid, though, and that was all that mattered.

					I went back to see if that thread was the one I recommended Bicycle Repairman on - it was. He&#039;s still great. But in one of the later messages was a link to <a href="http://qns.bike" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"> qns.bike</a>. I had not been to that site before. They had been advocating for the expansion of lanes on 31st ave that were recently installed, and their current petition is only 140 names short of a 1000 now for further expansion of lanes connecting Flushing Meadows and other parks to existing infrastructure. I signed today and thought I&#039;d give it a more current plug to help it along here.

					Yes! I know the one. It mixes some whistles and horns into the chimes too, but it is the &quot;Hello!&quot; at the end that prevents it from blending into the background and makes it especially maddening. After 2 hours of it I started to do research. There is a part of the NYC311 app that goes directly to noise complaints. I also googled it, and was led directly to a special ice cream truck complaint page the city runs. I like ice cream trucks, but the volume seems ridiculous, particularly when it&#039;s not quite warm yet and still rather dark in early evening.

					Yep, fabric was extra. I needed some and took his recommendation to go next door and get fabric from his neighbor. There are two fabric stores beside his shop, one upholstery and one more general purpose, and the upholstery-grade fabric I got from there was very nice and SUPER inexpensive, but of good quality. I believe the fabric store owner explained that they do work in Manhattan as well as movie/tv set work, so he hada lot of remnant rolls from various projects in addition to their stock. I cannot recall the price, but it was so cheap that I know I bought three extra yards to store in case I ever need to redo a seat or back piece. The furniture guy was able to look and tell me exactly how much yardage he needed for the job before I even walked over to the fabric place. He may be able to do the same from just a photo - it seems as if there is a formula they use. Measurements are helpful too of course, if the chair isn&#039;t physically there. It was my first venture into having things reupholstered, and both men were very helpful about the kinds of fabric material and colors that would be appropriate for my chairs.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad I have an excuse to respond again, because I realized that he only reupholstered four dining room chairs for me, not six as I earlier stated. I would hate to give incorrect price expectations for that work. It wasn&#039;t the cheapest, but certainly not the most expensive, and I have been very pleased with the work. He recovered and added padding to the seats and backs.

					I had six Danish dining room chairs reupholstered with new fabric at <a href="http://www.oscardecoinc.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.oscardecoinc.com/</a> . He&#039;s at 101 and Northern. Prices were reasonable (I think I paid $500 to $600 for the six chairs to be reupholstered as well as to have a wooden loveseat /two matching wooden chairs set retightened and refinished.) They said it might take a while, but I was delivered my furniture ahead of schedule and it was immaculately done. He also works with the fabric store next door to him. Super nice people to deal with and I&#039;d definitely go back and use them again. I dropped off the chairs/loveseat, but they delivered them back to me in a van. If I had haggled, I might have gotten them to pick them up too. That was the only real hassle. Worth a call or a stop in their small shop to see examples of their work.

					I find myself on the opposing side. There are stores like Sweetgreen in Manhattan (and other places) that are totally cashless. I find the concept off-putting and exclusionary. I believe they decided to do this to reduce possibility of employee theft/error, but it creates a two tiered society. One group has plastic to spend on a fancy salad for lunch, and the other has the funds to do so but those funds simply aren&#039;t good enough to be accepted.<br /><br />I often use my debit card at places and when they ask me if I want credit or debit I respond with &quot;whatever&#039;s cheapest for you&quot;. The laws around card fees have been changing, and I can understand that the fees can be onerous for small businesses. I try to meet them where they are at, especially since they obviously have something I want to spend money on. If they are cash only, as many restaurants in NYC can be, I make sure I have cash. I would rather have a spot err on the side of including all possible customers, that err by including only those who are savvy and wealthy enough to have a credit or debit card. Why do I want to create a trackable transaction for a cup of coffee anyway? And why must someone take a cut of that transaction? For my convenience? Eh... I just hit the ATM once in a while when I need to.

					Thanks Captain Flannel! I have often felt overwhelmed and don&#039;t know how to best channel my anger and frustration beyond the phone calls and letters I have already been writing. I appreciate your calling attention to specific ways that we can come together as a group to work for positive change. Your post was a welcomed push that led me to RSVP and see how I can help. I hope others hear the call and are able to contribute. Thanks for that!

					Jackson Hole? It may be East Elmhurst technically - kind of a grey area. I like their breakfast, and if Pauline is working I know I&#039;ll always get great service and a good conversation. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Isn&#039;t this the entire focus of the whole &quot;Vision Zero&quot; efforts? Is there a special office or person tasked in city government focusing on the issue of calming traffic and reducing pedestrian deaths? It&#039;s outrageous that multiple continued incidents and concerned citizen voices are finding a way to break through. I know that in my calls I will be asking specifically what plans there are for Vision Zero to target the roads in Jackson Heights. There were road changes and multiple traffic changes father down Northern Blvd in Woodside after students were run over by drivers in the last few years. We also deserve similar attention, and it feels as if there would be enough statistical data to back up the investment.

					I stopped by Buzzanca&#039;s on 90th after reading about it here and was reminded of Rose and Joe&#039;s in Astoria, but with much less on offer for sale. They had some cookies but limited breads: only a round loaf and longer Italian loaves, both unseeded. I got the round loaf and was disappointed that they did not have a slicing machine. I was really impressed though with its freshness and incredibly tight crumb. It was super tasty and long lasting. It looked as if they did more business selling cheesecakes (and probably flans). I was looking for some multigrain, rye, or darker bread options, but their white bread was really superior to much that I&#039;ve found.<br /><br />And as to croissants, I like the ones from the Food Bazzar on 34th and Junction over the other groceries. They seem to be flakier and fresher and more like an actual croissant should be.

I imagine that that&#039;s a sell to the folks dreading the coming L train shut down. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t he the same realtor that tried to invent a neighborhood mascot, Mr. Jack Heights? Evidently he&#039;s been working on targeting Brooklyn folks for some time: <a href="http://observer.com/2008/11/the-broker-who-would-make-jackson-heights-the-next-park-slope/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://observer.com/2008/11/the-broker-who-would-make-jackson-heights-the-next-park-slope/</a>
