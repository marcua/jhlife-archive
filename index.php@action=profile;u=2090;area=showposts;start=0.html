					It&#039;s wonderful seeing 34th Street so used.&nbsp; Obviously, people were craving space.&nbsp; What this shows me is what a lack of open public space we have in this neighborhood.&nbsp; Travers Park is wonderful but much too small for our population.&nbsp; The more closed streets we have the more space our residents will have.&nbsp; Hey, here&#039;s a wild idea:&nbsp; How about closing some streets permanently and converting them into park spaces with lawns, pathways, trees, and benches?&nbsp; Perhaps a few blocks on 34th and a few on 37th.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I love the closing of traffic on 34th Avenue from the BQE to 98th Street.&nbsp; Great idea.&nbsp; But I have a question for our political representatives:&nbsp; What are the most congested sidewalks in JH?&nbsp; Not a trick question.&nbsp; Obviously, 37th Ave and 82nd Street (between 37th Ave &amp; Roosevelt.)&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it make sense to close 37th Avenue to car traffic to allow for more social distancing?&nbsp; It would also allow the many restaurants and small shops to expand their businesses to outside areas.&nbsp; Some of the restaurants, for instance, could set up tables and service outside to expand their business, especially when they are allowed to reopen and can only have 50% or less occupancy.&nbsp; They could, conceivably, have full capacity with outdoor service.&nbsp; And we all love outsice dining.&nbsp; Small shops could also display items outside their shops on the sidewalk areas.&nbsp;

					In most cities with pedestrian sections store deliveries are usually done at specified times (early morning, overnight etc)&nbsp; Maybe even during specific daytime hours on weekdays or from side streets.&nbsp; Many options.&nbsp; Logistics could be worked out.&nbsp; We need to begin to put people at the center of planning and not cars and traffic.&nbsp; Cities are about people, neighborhoods, and moving large groups of people around efficiently.&nbsp; Cars are best suited for suburbs where businesses are far from residential areas.&nbsp; In cities residential and business districts overlap and are next to each other, often just blocks away.&nbsp; What makes NYC great is it is a mosaic of self-sustaining neighborhoods each with its own character.&nbsp; True, many work outside their neighborhoods and that is where mass transit becomes invaluable.&nbsp; Having millions of people, moving around the city in cars often one or two people in a vehicle, just doesn&#039;t make much sense.&nbsp; In many European cities residents may own cars but they are used primarily for travel outside the city, often for long trips.

					As for cars going to side streets -- that would not be an issue because the residential streets do not have commercial businesses.&nbsp; Most thru traffic, I believe, will be diverted to Northern Blvd which can best handle it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to many cities in Europe and most have these pedestrian only areas.&nbsp; Barcelona, for instance has a wonderful pedestrian thruway with stores and restaurants.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite long.&nbsp; We need to think about pedestrians and our quality of life.&nbsp; Somehow, over the years, the needs of cars has been the priority.&nbsp; We have pedestrians crowded on sidewalks.&nbsp; This is not about reducing the number of people in our neighborhood but opening space for them.&nbsp; And this is not only about opening space for people but improving their experience as they shop, seek entertainment, or just walk.&nbsp;

					I have to say, I&#039;m enjoying the quiet streets.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard a car honking in weeks.&nbsp; And the closing of a few blocks of 34th Ave. on weekends adds a new dimension.&nbsp; This quiet prompted me to think of our neighborhood and our quality of life.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#039;s time for our City Council person and Community Board to consider how we can improve our neighborhood in a visionary way.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a radical (or maybe not so radical) idea:&nbsp; Can we close 37th Avenue between say 74 St and 90th Street and also closing 82nd Street between 35 Ave and Roosevelt Ave -- allowing only deliveries and emergency vehicles?&nbsp; These are the most commercial streets and most congested streets in JH.&nbsp; To make them pedestrian only would both enhance the quality of life here (remember, we are underserved by parks) eliminating traffic noise and danger to pedestrians, and it would also enhance businesses.&nbsp; For example, restaurants could expand outdoor seating.&nbsp; Trees and greenery could be planted along the pedestrian mall etc.&nbsp; Anyway, I believe this would be a good time to start considering how to remodel and upgrade our neighborhood.&nbsp; This pandemic has given us an opportunity to reimagine our neighborhood.&nbsp;

					We use NYU Langone.&nbsp; They have a large group of doctors in the network and take most insurances.&nbsp; What we like about them is results are sent online and all your medical data is shared by any doctors you go to in their network so you don&#039;t have to always fill out forms for your medical history each time you go to a specialist (dermatologist, ophthalmologist, etc.)&nbsp; Good luck.

					The problem with this building is not just that it&#039;s bombastic and out of character for the neighborhood but it is so ill-used, in particular, the parking garage.&nbsp; What would be great, In my&nbsp; opinion, is if the parking garage was repurposed as a YMCA or interior market like the new markets being created around the city.&nbsp; A place for small shops/vendors like the Essex Street Market (for example.)&nbsp; I always thought that there was so much potential for part of it to be a restaurant with an open air eating air where the parking space is now.&nbsp; There is all this wonderful space wasted on cars and not being used for people.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Here&#039;s my fear.&nbsp; Now that Amazon as withdrawn what will happen to that site?&nbsp; Well, it will not sit idle.&nbsp; Developers will come in and build luxury hi-rise condos.&nbsp; The condos will be purchased by wealthy non-residents who will not pay city or state income taxes.&nbsp; New York City is becoming a vacation/tourist spot.&nbsp; We are not creating new jobs other than in the service/tourist industry.&nbsp; Amazon would have created good paying jobs that would have provided income tax revenue for the city and state.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t create good paying job in the city we will end up being a city where few people live but many people visit.&nbsp; The Amazon deal was far from perfect but we could have worked with them once they set up shop here.&nbsp; We could have encouraged them to invest in our city infrastructure (to improve the quality of life of their staff/employees.)&nbsp; And, BTW, not all the jobs would have been hi-tech.&nbsp; There would also have been a need for maintenance, security, custodial etc position.&nbsp; There could also have been partnering with our many colleges/universities.&nbsp; Anyway, it&#039;s done.&nbsp; And now we need to move on and figure out how to create more new jobs for our city&#039;s future.&nbsp;

					Actually, I&#039;d like to see Amazon move to a Red State like GA (Atlanta) or IN or even OH.&nbsp; They would change the demographics and move the state towards blue. We need to turn some of these red states around and changing the demographics would be a start.&nbsp; It&#039;s young techies and managers would probably be mostly educated liberals and progressives and would not be a bad thing.&nbsp; Just my thought.

					The problem with the discussion of gentrification is that often the people that complain about it the most are the cause of it in the first place.&nbsp; People want to move into a neighborhood and then they don&#039;t want it to change.&nbsp; But often their moving in has changed the demographic/economic feature of it.&nbsp; I know people who have grown up in JH and moved away.&nbsp; They moved up economically from their parents and now have moved into neighborhoods and displaced others.&nbsp; There is no real right or wrong in this debate.&nbsp; Change is driven by economic forces.&nbsp; Realtors, landlords, property owners want the most money they can get for their property.&nbsp; NYC has always been a city of change -- good &amp; bad.&nbsp; JH was once an upper middle class neighborhood until it was overdeveloped and the Irish and Italian immigrants moved in.&nbsp; And they were displaced by Latinos and South Asians.&nbsp; We are again in another era of transition.&nbsp; Where this will take us we don&#039;t know yet.&nbsp; The people who are moving in will form it&#039;s nature.&nbsp; I see many Chinese and other Asians moving into our neighborhood.&nbsp; Will we look more like Flushing?&nbsp; We also have more transplanted Brooklynites.&nbsp; Will we look more like Greenpoint?&nbsp; Will the Latinos stay or move out?&nbsp; My only concern is that we remain diverse and not overwhelmed by one ethnic group or another.&nbsp; I like variety.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want an all Flushing or all Greenpoint or all Spanish Harlem.&nbsp; I&#039;d like them all here.&nbsp; Together.&nbsp; I&#039;d like the working class and the upper class.&nbsp; But this is all out of anyone&#039;s control really.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see.&nbsp; It&#039;s an adventure.&nbsp;
