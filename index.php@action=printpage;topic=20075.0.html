				sounds promising. does it seem to be one of those places that brings in pre-made, pre-wrapped pastries or more like Rainbow and Fay Da, where some things are made on premises?

				The salads are freshly made and delicious. And cheap! 5 dollars for a fermented ginger salad and 6 dollars for a tea leaf salad.

				This place seems pretty special. It&#039;s Burmese, the same business as the one inside Tibetan Mobile aka Lhasa Fast Food. They are really trying now to show what they can do. Hopefully people will buy from them so we can keep this jewel.

				I checked this place out yesterday and got the tea leaf salad. So flavorful and tasty! They made it to order and didn&#039;t pull any punches when I said &quot;yes&quot; to spiciness. Want to try the papaya salad next.

				They had a mixed seafood salad yesterday that was really delicious. I don&#039;t think it was listed on the board, but you can ask for it.

				Visited the Yun Cafe yesterday.<br />It’s an odd “only-in-Queens” kind of place. A tiny space with some shelves of SE Asian snacks &amp; condiments; display case of tired looking donuts, croissants; and a small menu of freshly made Burmese salads. <br />I ordered the Tea Leaf salad and Fermented Ginger salad with a side of the longest grain rice I have ever seen. Funky, salty, spicy, sweet. Delicious!!<br />

				Just had lunch here. Shared a seafood salad, tea leaf salad and noodle with chicken and egg salad. All fresh, delicious and prepared while you wait with spiciness per your own specifications. Amazing variety of textures too. So happy to have this cafe in the neighborhood!

				My friend also tried out the tea salad and said it has better flavor than Asian Bowl, another Burmese restaurant in Queens. Hoping they would offer hot noodle soups and less salad once the weather turns colder.
