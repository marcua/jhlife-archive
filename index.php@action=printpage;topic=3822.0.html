				I had my tub reglazed a few months ago, and so far I&#039;ve had no problem with the finish. I think I paid around $375.

				I used Best Glazing. Did a great job, had my tub glazed and tiles painted for a total of $700. Nice guy, a bit of a challenge to work in the beginning..personality conflict, did a great job and this was 2yrs ago and still looks new!&nbsp; I would recommend you have your tub etc caulked first. Best Glazing was the only one that would look at the bathtub and tiles first in person, others wanted pictures sent to them.&nbsp;

It&#039;s cheap, only $225, and I thought he did a good job until I noticed one small part of the bathtub that&#039;s not completely covered. I called him last Monday. He said I should not be worried and he would come in last Wednesday to check. He didn&#039;t come and I could not contact him since (via either phone, text or voice message.)<br /><br />He may contact me soon. I just want to report the price and that it may come with a catch.

				<em><strong>I&#039;m sorry you had some drama with Ed but I have used Eduardo dozens of times .&nbsp; On a couple of occasions I had to call him back to touch up an area but in all honesty out of the 4 other guys I have used before he is the best and most responsible.&nbsp; My advise to anyone re-glazing their tub is to avoid using it for at least two days if possible, even if they say 24 hrs.&nbsp; </strong></em>

				I used Eduardo a few weeks ago based on the posts here and he was great. Showed up right on time, was very speedy, meticulously cleaned up after. I would highly recommend.

				We had it done when we moved in 7 years ago, and it only lasted a few years before it started peeling. Not doing it again, as we are going to gut renovate the bathroom. I have no idea if the problem was the way it was done--my impression is that it only lasts a few years regardless. But I really don&#039;t know. We paid a few hundred dollars.
