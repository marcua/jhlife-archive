				Not seeing many sales anymore, only rentals on this forum. Whats going on? <br />Could be b/c the majority are from James van horn now... or maybe it&#039;s something else. Any thoughts?

				I still look at streeteasy from time to time out of habit and it seems like new sales are posted regularly. I think the agents who post on here are much more limited and maybe specific to the JH market. Agents with companies like Corcoran and Halstead don&#039;t bother with poor old JHL :-(

				JHfamilies has a lot of postings by Kathy Pappas for both rentals and sales.<br />I do think James Van Horn, perhaps, is following the AB Winery school of saturation advertising.<br />Well, guess it is a free country.<br /><br />Have you looked at the NYTimes listings or the MLSLI sites?<br /><br />

				There are still co-ops out there for sale, but as has been said, they don&#039;t get posted on JHL. Seems like JVH has taken over the postings and just saturates - and not everything is even in JH. <br />I&#039;d much rather be saturated by Addictive Boutique Wine and&nbsp; be surrounded by empty wine bottles! <br /><br />I remember at one time, most if not all of the sales in JH were with local brokers - the big guys like Corcoran, Halstead and Elliman didn&#039;t bother with us, and if they did, it was rare. There&#039;s still a couple of local brokers selling but as I&#039;ve been looking over the last year or so, there are far more big brokers than ever before. There used to be this great site - natefind.com - you could just type in a neighborhood or street and it would bring up every single home for sale matching your criteria for all brokers. I will say one thing I have noticed with the big brokers in JH, the prices seem more uniform and realistic. There&#039;s one broker in JH who, in my opinion, always lists properties for far more than they could sell for. I would love to know what they actually sell for. <br /><br />Now where&#039;s that wine...

				Many of you have taking the time to critic me, for posting rentals in this forum.

				Yeah, totally cool to post. You post useful things that adds to the discussion of the neighborhood.<br /><br /><br />So you&#039;re saying that people can no longer afford to buy a place? I feel like both sales and rental prices are going up A LOT lately - probably making it harder for people to save up bc they are paying such high rental prices. Why do you not to sales anymore?

				Kudos on that sweet transformation!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to find a floorplan of it.&nbsp; In my mind, I cannot picture where the second bedroom is.&nbsp; I figured if it were to be made, it would be done by carving into the living room to augment the little nook that was there, but I just don&#039;t see that from the pictures.

				Yes, would love to see a floor plan!<br /><br />I think it would be the &quot;maids&quot; room between the dining room and kitchen. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious to see how the original split, which happened during the depression apparently, handled the two entryways. <br /><br />The towers are two apartments per landing. Curious to see where they added a third door.

				There is a floor plan for the another building&nbsp; (33-27 80th st) at the tower in the streeteasy<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/sale/484328-coop-33-27-80th-street-jackson-heights (http://streeteasy.com/sale/484328-coop-33-27-80th-street-jackson-heights)<br /><br />(http://cdn-img3.streeteasy.com/nyc/image/31/10388231.gif?_ga=1.134118344.797227809.1419679273)<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure of the floor about the the particular building that has the 519K apartment. However, the right apartment of the above is definitely a classic 7 (3 formal bedrooms, one maid room, and a dining room, and a living room, and a kitchen), which was described from mpc properties.<br /><br />The 1/2 bedroom apartment (in the rear or in the garden) could be constructed by including the top two bedrooms (near the garden) and the two bath rooms and the kitchen next to them and the entrance/livingroom/foryer could be from the bedroom near the entrance.<br /><br />By doing this type of split, the front of the classic 7 would be a small one bedroom or a big studio apartment (the maid room would become a small kitchen).

				You are going back and forth over two different four-room Towers apartments.&nbsp; The one on the first floor was in terrible condition and closed at $230,000.&nbsp; Another one on the fourth floor closed at $405,000.&nbsp; The one in the pictures is another listing, I believe on the second floor, priced at $519,000.&nbsp; <br /><br />One seven-room line in this same building was divided into two apartment in the 1930s: one is a three room with the fireplace, the other is a four room that has two bathrooms.&nbsp; These very rarely turn over, but in less than one year three came to market.&nbsp; Just coincidence.

When people just had the online info for the wrecked apartment 2B and mistakenly assumed it was on second floor.&nbsp; The information obtained online in conjunction with the incorrect assumption is a recipe for confusion. The most reliable information should come from a local realty expert such as jhlifer or an actual visit of the apartments.<br /><br />It&#039;s also interesting to note that Queens Brownstoner also picked the incorrect info from this thread http://queens.brownstoner.com/2015/01/listing-of-the-day-33-16-81st-street/ (http://queens.brownstoner.com/2015/01/listing-of-the-day-33-16-81st-street/)
