				Just curious what do most people do/use for trash bag.<br /><br />I usually use these plastic bag from supermarket as trash bag. Like for baby diaper, vacuum dirt, food waste (since my build doesn&#039;t do food compost yet), plastic wrap from package, junk letter, etc. <br /><br />Do most folks just buy like glad bag and such, and how is that any different in eliminating plastic bag.

				most trash bags -- commercially created for that use -- are bio-degradable to some degree, some completely. theoretically, they could probably make grocery bags that way, but they&#039;re expensive and would probably be charged for.

				Seems to me everyone in our building uses the plastic grocery bags as trash bags.&nbsp; Recently, I&#039;ve been using the small produce bags for food waste to eliminate odors.&nbsp; Methinks, GLAD and HEFTY are going to come out the big winners.........and hopefully, the environment.

				The ban on plastics is&nbsp; being postponed for a month. It’s a shame because after all this planning they still can’t get it right.&nbsp; Millions of bags will now be in our oceans and trees needlessly. Should have been done years ago.

There will be no penalty for failing to comply with the ban for the first month, but the ban is still in place. This is not a change to the original plan Andrew is fairly common when new laws are instituted. They also did this when they first put in speed cameras in NYC.

				Does anyone use those compost-bin and dump it to the farmer market on Saturday? <br />Curiosity how well it works and any issue/tip to share?<br /><br />Does it smell if you store whole week of waste (since my coop doesn&#039;t participate yet)? Can you do left over cooked food, uncooked seafood (like shrimp shell), meat bone? Does it cause fruit flies or bugs during hot summer. I look through few of Amazon products and some of the reviews, seem like these are what most talk about/complaint.<br /><br />I usually just put fruit and veggie skin only and in tight seal container then dump at farmer market. Would like to do coffee and tea leaves too, since I consume both on daily basis.

				we did it when we had a house. i don&#039;t remember a lot of smell. coffee and coffee filters work well. eggshells, too. i don&#039;t recall using meat, but my partner at the time was a vegetarian, so we seldom had any around. newspaper works, too. it supposedly speeds the process, according to a neighbor who taught us the process.

We store the full bags in the freezer so no mess and easy to drop off. You can&#039;t compost meat, dairy, or oily foods.

				A bit puzzled, though I realize things may still be &quot;adjusting&quot;:<br /><br />Bought toilet paper at Duane Reade - plastic bags offered. <br /><br />Kitchen garbage bags and mopping wipes at Riteaid - no bag offered<br /><br />Cooking wine at Foodtown - bags offered<br /><br />Chicken livers at Key Food - no bag offered, though I think they are supposed to be for meat<br /><br />Fish at name I can never remember, Broadway &amp; Pettit - bag offered<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This may be why:<br /><br />https://nypost.com/2020/02/28/state-officials-say-fines-under-new-yorks-bag-ban-wont-start-for-another-month/<br /><br />New York statewide plastic bag ban begins this Sunday — but actual enforcement won’t start for a month, officials said Friday.<br /><br />State authorities agreed Thursday to delay penalizing stores violating New York’s ban of single-use plastic bags until April 1 after grocers filed a last-minute lawsuit to try and block the law.

				&nbsp;A family member whose works for a plastic bag manufacturer on Long Island said they are also suing. It&#039;s a smallish business that the same people have worked at for decades and now they all stand to lose their jobs and the owner will have to shut down and lose the whole operation. I&#039;m glad this happened but the implementation seems to have been sudden for some people.

				The issue isn&#039;t people who reuse these bags as garbage bags.&nbsp; It&#039;s the people that do not, of which there are many thousands more.&nbsp; If you do not monetize the cost of the plastic bag in terms of it&#039;s role in public pollution, clogging drains, getting caught in trees, harming the environment, etc., then the result is what we have today.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plastic bags are a genius invention.&nbsp; I love them.&nbsp; But more people don&#039;t consider the cost than do, and therefore if you want a plastic bag in the future, you need to pay for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;
