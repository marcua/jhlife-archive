			There is a new art supply store opening up on 37th avenue.. in the mid 80s. can&#039;t remember which street. we walked past it during the halloween parade and they were giving out business cards and saying they would be opening soon. looks promising!

			Yes I was just wondering if anyone knew when it was going to open<br /><br />Michael&#039;s is overpriced and doesn&#039;t have quality art supplies (my opinion)
