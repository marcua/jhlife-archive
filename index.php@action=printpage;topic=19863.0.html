				The governor talked yesterday about his daughters new boyfriend, then posted a picture of his lovely dinner party with his 3 daughters and the new boyfriend.&nbsp; His rational is that everyone was quarantined for 2 weeks.<br /><br />So, since we are all making up stuff as we go along.&nbsp; Does that mean that we can hang out with other people as long as we all have been in 2 weeks of isolation?&nbsp; <br /><br />It’s a very mixed message.

				I think as long as you can trust and guarantee that everyone&#039;s been in isolation and you&#039;re not taking public transportation to hang out, it should be ok.&nbsp;

I was thinking he was talking about the eldest daughter and her boyfriend having been in quarantine. Yes, it&#039;s clear he hasn&#039;t been in quarantine. So he&#039;d be able to infect them (if he&#039;s been exposed an infected in the past two weeks) but they won&#039;t be infecting him.<br /><br />Perhaps since he&#039;s governor, he has better access to testing and he got tested before they came to stay. I really don&#039;t know, but I personally am not concerned.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Those of us with lots of contact with young people might see this differently. The boyfriend of Cuomo&#039;s daughter might very well have been living with them this whole time under quarantine. Many parents got &quot;surprised&quot; by this circumstance of couples not wanting to be apart and I know lots of circumstances where they choose one parents place or the other parents place to wait this out together. Young love prevails.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I strongly think that is what&#039;s happening here but they just might not want to publicize it.

				i don&#039;t think any parent in the 21st century would be that shocked about an adult daughter being, shall we say, &quot;romantically active&quot; with a partner. the Cuomo women range in age from 22 to 25.

				&nbsp;Not just romantically involved but deciding to shelter in place with people who they were not known to have a serious relationship with at the time, that&#039;s the surprise element.

				i know people in that age group, and people with offspring in that age group, and it&#039;s not rare. granted, it was more common in the &#039;70s and &#039;80s, but it&#039;s still out there.

				My impression from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFY_P6yR0BY is that Cuomo and his three daughters are now living in the same house. Skip to around 25min. So having dinner together doesn&#039;t seem so unusual.

				Give the Cuomo&#039;s a break! The governor seems to be well aware of what to do and what not to do. Wasn&#039;t he talking from the beginning about visitors and keeping his mother safe? Didn&#039;t his own brother come down with Corona? Are his daily updates making any sense? And who cares, if he doesn&#039;t, who his daughters sleep with?<br /><br />I think some people have too much time on their hands right now.

				I don’t give a shot who his daughter sleeps with...<br /><br />I care that we are all told to lock down and have zero social engagements. Yet he has a fabulous dinner party and invited over his daughters boyfriend.&nbsp;

				Please feel free to have dinner with your family also, if they and you have been quarantined for at least two weeks. Considering Cuomo&#039;s leadership during this crisis, maybe we can wait until the crisis is over before we complain about his shortcomings again.<br />(https://mobile.twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1252010729751928833/photo/1)

				Who made up that rule?&nbsp; It’s okay to have people over if you have been in quarantine in for 2 weeks?&nbsp; I have never read that or seen it. I was told zero socialization with anyone that doesn’t live in your house.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don’t know about you, but everybody I know In JH has been isolated in their Apts for the&nbsp; 6 weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would love to have friends and family over for dinner, if the governor gives the okay.

				if you have a huge home that can hold three daughters, three boyfriends and a wild card, no biggie. someone living in a four bedroom in the Towers has more room than someone in a studio. that&#039;s life.

The idea is if you have been completely isolated, and the other people have also been completed isolated (quarantine means you&#039;re sick or been exposed to someone who has the virus/suspected of having the virus. so you need to stay away from others while you recover or wait out the 2 week incubation period.) for two weeks, and have no symptoms, you&#039;re very likely not infected.I don&#039;t know what that means for asymptomatic carriers (or if there are asymptomatic carriers) or people with symptoms so mild they don&#039;t notice it.<br /><br />The governor and those around him probably gets tested often, but that doesn&#039;t eliminate the possibility of a false negative. Maybe the people in his household also get tested regularly since they are in close proximity with the governor of NY state.<br /><br />I know people who left NYC after being completely isolated for several weeks by being picked up by a family member with a car that also had been completely isolated for several weeks.&nbsp;
