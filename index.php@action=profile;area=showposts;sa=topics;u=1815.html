					Todays NY Times states the following:<br /><br />In interviews, his supporters described Mr. Moya as a smart and loyal soldier for the Queens Democratic Party chairman, Representative Joseph Crowley. Mr. Crowleyâ€™s posters are all over the windows of Mr. Moyaâ€™s campaign headquarters on 37th Avenue, a narrow store where a clothes boutique called D-Lishus used to be.<br /><br />A person close to the Moya campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize Mr. Moya or Mr. Crowley, put it this way: â€œFrancisco took a pass whenever he needed to take a pass. <span class="bbc_u">Heâ€™s been overlooked without complaining.

Whose display of community service is as a lobbyist for CABLEVISION and third is the Queens County lap dog. Well?<br /><br />So Brian pulls out who I would have voted for and now what?&nbsp; I will NOT vote for either of the two Democratic candidates.&nbsp; Maybe I will wait till Novemeber and vote NONE OF THE ABOVE!&nbsp; I will vote for al the positions and skip the 39th Assembly.&nbsp; WE MUST SEND A MESAGE.&nbsp; Hopefully next time, in two years we can all come together and support a representative who really is from the community and can represent us well.

Joe Crowley&#039;s ethics get closer eye</strong><br /><br />BY Ben Lesser and Michael Mcauliff In Washington<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS<br /><br />Tuesday, June 15th 2010, 4:00 AM<br /><br />Lobbyist fund-raisers for powerful Rep. Joe Crowley are being asked about their dealings with the New York Democrat and seven other legislators, his office acknowledged Monday.<br /><br />House ethics cops apparently want to know whether their donations swayed lawmakers&#039; votes on the financial reform bill that passed the House last year, two lawmakers in the preliminary probe told The Hill newspaper.<br /><br />A Democrat familiar with such preliminary investigations said they often amount to nothing, but a letter from the House Office of Congressional Ethics obtained by The Hill says probers are especially interested in fund-raisers held from Dec. 2 to Dec. 11.<br /><br />Crowley&#039;s campaign raised a bit more than $40,000 in that span, federal records show.<br /><br />A Crowley spokesman said no wrongdoing will be found on his part, saying, &quot;Congressman Crowley has always complied with the letter and spirit of all rules regarding fund-raising and standards of conduct.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>While it was unclear what the watchdogs were seeking, an ongoing Daily News investigation of Crowley (D-Queens, Bronx) has found that he often relies on lobbyists and political action committees to raise cash</strong>.<br /><br />James Delaplane, with the Washington outfit Davis &amp; Harman, which has several financial services clients, raised $19,750 for Crowley at an event last year.<br /><br />&quot;My clients have supported [Crowley] for a long time,&quot; he said last month, well before news of the preliminary probe broke. Delaplane said yesterday his firm has not received letters from the congressional probers.<br /><br />Davis &amp; Harman founder Thomas Davis did donate $500 to Crowley on Dec. 11, though there was no other sign it might bear on the investigation.<br /><strong><br />Crowley has raised lots of cash from lobbyists and political action committees with business before his Ways and Means Committee, including real estate interests seeking favorable tax treatment. </strong>But Crowley told The News prior to the probe it was &quot;crazy&quot; to suggest donations have influenced his votes. &quot;I have never, ever, ever sold my vote,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_crowleys_ethics_get_closer_eye.html#ixzz0r2TGfVQl" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2010/06/15/2010-06-15_crowleys_ethics_get_closer_eye.html#ixzz0r2TGfVQl</a><br />

					Happy Holidays all.&nbsp; I wanted to share this Christmas classic with all my neighbors-&nbsp; <br /><br />Twas the Night before Christmas Poem<br /><br />Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br />The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br /><br />The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.<br />And mamma in her â€˜kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />Had just settled our brains for a long winterâ€™s nap.<br /><br />When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br /><br />The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br />Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br />When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.<br /><br />With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br />More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br /><br />&quot;Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br />On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!<br />To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br />Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!&quot;<br /><br />As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br />So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br />With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.<br /><br />And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br />As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.<br /><br />He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br />A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br />And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.<br /><br />His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br />His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br />And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br /><br />The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br />He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br />That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br /><br />He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br />And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br />A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br /><br />He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br />And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br />And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!<br /><br />He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br />But I heard him exclaim, â€˜ere he drove out of sight,<br />&quot;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!&quot; <br />
