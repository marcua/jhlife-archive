				That&#039;s so scary ... something so severe and vicious at 8:50PM (which isn&#039;t even that late). I&#039;m sure most businesses were open at that time, so there should have been more witness accounts ... saddening indeed. <br /><br />How much gang activity is there in JH?

I read this story last night when they were calling it a hit and run but it just baffles me how severely beaten this person was to be thought to have been run over... I also agree that there have had to been witnesses... Very scary indeed... On the subject of gang activity I&#039;m guessing there is more than we really notice... I heard that last night there was also a stabbing atthe KFC on 88 and northern around the same time of this incident... My brother and his friend were walking home when they walked by there and saw the paramedics and the victim.<br /><br />Looks like the beating was caught on surveillance video:<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/11/01/2010-11-01_surveillance_video_shows_fatal_beating_in_queens_so_savage_that_police_mistook_i.html#ixzz142xfOcdE

				A lot of businesses close early on Sunday. I was out around the time and noticed how dark 37th Ave was. Was he found in the street, is that why they think it was a hit and run?<br /><br />There was an article in NY Mag about gangs and they had a breakdown of which gangs hail from which neighborhoods. I think we had The Latin Kings? I could be wrong about this.

				Foxy, I think we also have MS 13 (Mara Salvatrucha). One of the scariest gangs around, in my opinion.&nbsp; They are rampant in VA and MD, where I lived for many years, and have been making lots of inroads here in NYC (they are mainly from El Salvador, I think).&nbsp; Very, very violent, even for a gang.&nbsp;

				Here is the link to the article Foxy is referring to:<br /><br />http://nymag.com/news/features/establishments/68516/<br /><br />I actually came across it on the magazine and didn&#039;t really think much of it when I read it. I hope the police can make some progress and clarifications on the case.&nbsp; It&#039;s such a shame to have this happen :(

				Sad to say but I was just commenting yesterday that murders in the 115th Pct. are at zero for the year.<br /><br />Not anymore, this is so sad, and it happened on halloween with high police presence, and relatively early in the evening.

				Such an awful, tragic waste.&nbsp; <br /><br />I honestly would like to know <em>what is wrong</em> with somebody who could do this to another person.

				I agree this is awful. I wonder if the same group that I heard was causing trouble in the 70&#039;s was involved. There were police helicopters and alot of cruisers that night.<br />
