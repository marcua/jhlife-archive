				<strong>Jackson Heights Life Photo Contest - Summer 2009</strong><br /><br />Welcome to the Third Jackson Heights Life Photo Contest!&nbsp; We are looking for an excellent photograph to use on the banner of our website.&nbsp; Here are the rules for our contest:<br /><br />1. Three submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />2. Images should be in digital format, taken with at LEAST a 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality.<br />3. Photos should not portray identifiable individuals.<br />4. Photos should have a horizonal composition to look good as a banner, which is approximately 5 times as wide as it is tall.<br />5. A small version of the image should be posted to this thread with a brief title or description.<br />6. The contest starts immediately and will run until June 21, 2009. At that time the contest will be closed to new entries.<br />7. After the submission period is closed, the JHLife community will vote on the submitted images.<br />8. In July, a winner will be announced and the graphics will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />By your submission, you are giving us permission to use your image on the Jackson Heights Life homepage.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If selected, your image will run until approximately Labor Day.&nbsp; It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Jackson Heights... photos that capture a sense of the season are especially welcome.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is no need to crop your photo before posting it for this contest.&nbsp; If your photo is selected, we will work with you to turn the photo into an appropriate banner.&nbsp; We will put your name, username or email on the bottom of the banner so people can contact you.<br /><br />FYI, there are two ways to post photos on this site.&nbsp; The first way is to upload them to another site, like Flickr or Photobucket, and link to the image from here.&nbsp; An explanation of how to do this is over here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=374.msg1700#msg1700).<br /><br />The second way is to attach a file directly to your post.&nbsp; At the bottom of the page, click on &quot;Additional Options,&quot; and then enter the filename in the box next to &quot;Attach:&quot;.&nbsp; Files must be smaller than 128 kB.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><em>signed,<br />Moderators shelby2 and chuckster<br />and Calendar Editor toddg</em><br /><br />P.S. Thanks to TBM for the excellent photo we have been using for the past several months.<br /><br />P.P.S. For reference, here is the winner of Photo Contest #1 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=550.0):<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2186/2418653711_77d9d2c2b3_o.jpg)<br /><br />and here is the winner of Photo Contest #2 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1678.45):<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/3577078347_722b638d96_o.jpg)<br />

				Well, since everybody is being a bit shy, I&#039;ll nominate a picture to get the ball rolling.&nbsp; This is a picture of the Berkeley courtyard that I previously nominated for Banner Photo Contest #1.&nbsp; It&#039;s the wrong season, so I hope that somebody else comes up with something better!<br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2360535190_1379201361_b.jpg)

				Here is my little photo that I took on the garden tour today while in the Towers Garden. &nbsp;I like the juxtaposition of the quiet garden and the craziness of adjacent Northern Blvd. &nbsp;I think it pretty much sums up living in Jackson Heights. &nbsp;We really have the best of both worlds here.

				It&#039;s time to vote!&nbsp; Let us know which is your favorite.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please keep in mind that the final image we use will have approximately the same proportions as the banner we&#039;re currently using (probably even a bit thinner).&nbsp; So any standard-sized photo will need to be cropped significantly.&nbsp; But a thin slice of a squarish photo can still look great!<br /><br />Once a winning photo is selected, we will work with the photographer to find the best way to crop the image for the banner.<br /><br />Voting will remain open through July 12th.&nbsp; Good luck, everyone!

				Yesterday, a friend whom I was on the phone with told me to look at the clouds. Apparently, they looked awesome. I&#039;ve seen pictures since, and they kind of did.

				You have to keep in mind, which will be best resized in the banner.... As you see, the dimensions are very much different, so a picture whose emphasis is higher than the banner will allow will not capture it&#039;s essence properly. <br />I may vote for the one with the tree, although I think the color was enhanced.
