				I came across a new Chock Full O&#039;nuts coffee shop in Astoria today, on B&#039;way and 36th street, and in my mind was immediately was transported back about 35 or so years to the CFON on 82 st and Roosevelt ave!&nbsp; The new place was very small, take out only, no long curved counter to sit at!&nbsp; The menu was modernized as well....latte, cappuccino, fancy chi-chi-foo-foo pastries, certainly not what I remember from the CFON of my youth. My mom used to rave about their coffee and the cream cheese with nuts on wheat bread(?) sandwiches, and I remember the sugary doughnuts. I had a cup of coffee from the new place today, but as I wasn&#039;t a coffee drinker in my grade school days back in the early 70&#039;s, i don&#039;t know if the quality was the same!&nbsp; Anybody out there in cyber space know when the JH branch of CFON closed it&#039;s doors?&nbsp; Just wonderin&#039;....

				Does anyone remember the CFON jingle, &quot;the Heavenly Coffee, better coffee a millionaire&#039;s money can&#039;t buy?&quot;<br /><br />The founder of CFON was a certain Mr. Black. It seems that one night at the cabaret at the Carlyle Hotel he became smitten by an aspiring singer, Page Morton, who later became Mrs. Black and recorded the original jingle that was played on the air for years afterwards.<br /><br />She was a customer of my father&#039;s store and you could say we knew her. Often while she was visiting mother, her chauffer would ride us kids around the block in the back of her limo. We&#039;d raise the privacy window and sing Heavenly Coffee. <br /><br />She would design her own dresses and hats with the help of Balenciaga. Usually something fish tailed and low decollatage always showing the south sea pearl choker with huge heart shaped diamond dangleing from it, that of course Mr. Black had given her.<br /><br />She was actually a sweet person, a bit out of step, and a character of her own creation. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure that many of the old Jackson Heights dowagers, who would ride the 82 Street bus down Fifth Avenue to B. Altman&#039;s - white wrist gloves, pill box hats, and purse perfectly poised in their laps, would have brushed elbows with Mrs. Black in Altman&#039;s. They might even have had afternoon tea there together.<br /><br />These were ladies of another era altogether, and grande dames at that!

				It was definitely still there around 1982, but by 1985 I think it was gone.<br /><br />
