				<strong>It is actually between 87th and 88th st.&nbsp; 8709 34th ave.&nbsp; I just placed a small Jr 4 handyman in contract, well actually the contract is out for signing.&nbsp; I have a small 1 bedroom still available.&nbsp; I sold a 2 bedroom unit in your building at 86-11 34th Ave last year and it was a sponsor unit.&nbsp; I think the one in the 3rd floor is a stabilized unit?&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember well but I think there was some water damage last year and I went into the unit and took care of it.<br /><br />I was under the impresion there were more investor or sponsor units in the building.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s the reason I never got another unit to sell in your building from my client.&nbsp; I had a tough time getting comparables at first but the 2nd time around I got lucky and the unit sold for about $260k (it&#039;s been over a year so I can&#039;t recall).&nbsp; Your building is well kept and clean.&nbsp; Your female super seems to be busy all the time.&nbsp; I think 34th Ave is totally underrated.</strong>

				<strong>Oh yeah, By the way...the sponsor did sell with 10% Down.<br /><br />Your re-sales require 20% Down, but the sponsor still has (or had) the 10% option</strong>
