					Turnstile numbers don&#039;t really indicate at all how crowded or the absolute number of people in a station at a given time. I can understand how Main St has more people who swipe their card than Roosevelt Ave, but I really doubt that Main St has anywhere near the amount of foot traffic that Roosevelt Ave does. <br />Roosevelt Ave is a major west-bound transfer point for at least 5 other stations. <br /><br /><br />I recall at some points during the year, there are MTA workers with clipboards that appear to count how many people actually get on and off the train, which would be a much more relevant statistic. <br /><br />On a slightly related note, anyone remember the site outside the station after Hurricane Sandy when they re-opened the subways? More people on the street than the Nepalese festival.

					Could have sworn either Metro or AMNY came out with stats a few months back, and Roosevelt Ave was the busiest station outside of Manhattan. I can&#039;t find the article online though. <br /><br />I find it hard to believe that Main Street (1 line) is bigger than Roosevelt Ave (5 lines).

					For one thing, we can get rid of the guy who distributes handouts to the transients on the corner of 72nd and Roosevelt every night. It&#039;s a public health concern when every other night there&#039;s 20-30 transients eating food on the ground and leaving the trash for us residents to walk through. Bird shit everywhere and puddles of urine right next to the momo cart. <br /><br />Not to the concern of crime from having so many people there hanging out all the time with nothing to do. Poor Filipino guy just got punched in the face the other day and died.<br /><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-dies-punched-face-stranger-queens-article-1.1843230" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-dies-punched-face-stranger-queens-article-1.1843230</a><br /><br />Get rid of the AM New York stand on the corner of Broadway and 72nd because it just gets strewn about everytime it rains or someone decides they want to throw the newspapers. <br /><br />And how about the furniture movers that leave their filing cabinets and office chairs on the corner of Roosevelt and 72nd once or twice a week? Since when is that a staging area for movers? Get them out.<br /><br />You&#039;d think Daniel Dromm would treat this as a priority issue, but he&#039;s too busy with his own &quot;agenda&quot; to care about basic quality-of-life issues. Yeah I&#039;ve written to him before, and they just play the blame game, saying it&#039;s the MTA not the city. If it&#039;s an issue they actually cared about, they&#039;d figure out a way to get it done.

					I disagree with that attitude that there&#039;s not much to be done.<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Several times per week if you walk by at night you will see there is a truck that gives out handouts of food. I am not against handouts of food but in this case, the place ends up a complete mess the next day as people sit on the street there while consuming their food, and then some of them just dispose their garbage on the street. Oftentimes the trash cans are completely full. Solution here is to a) empty the garbage cans more frequently and b) revisit any sort of license that this handouts truck has. All the other food establishments in the area have licenses and need to adhere to practices - why not this one? </li><li>I walked by today and there was a puddle of human urine. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s from the same people getting food handouts or not, but either way it&#039;s disgusting. More police presence in this area would stop this because urinating on the street is illegal.</li><li>They just paved the sidewalk under the train there, but they left it with a rough concrete surface rather than a smooth one. This makes it impossible to scrub any bird crap away! Sure even if they scrubbed it every day there would still be some bird crap, but since this is such a high-traffic area near one of the biggest subway stations in Queens, it needs some regular attention. As of now, I don&#039;t think it gets any.</li><li>As a long term solution they could cover up the underside of the tracks so that there are no spaces for a bird to nest. </li><li>There is a momo cart that sits almost practically under the tracks there in the stench of the urine and bird crap. Whatever you do, don&#039;t eat there.&nbsp; </li></ul>

					It&#039;s bee a month since I posted this but is no one else completely repulsed by this?<br />I walked by this morning and there is a giant puddle of what looks to be urine with pigeon crap&nbsp; everywhere. The smell is absolutely overwhelming.

					I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve all seen it. I lived in Elmhurst for a couple years and never had to cross that street to get to the Roosevelt Ave station, but now that I&#039;m living in Woodside and still go to the Roosevelt Ave station, I cross over that intersection several times a day. <br />There is bird crap everywhere, and even if you&#039;re within one block of it you can smell it <span class="bbc_u">everywhere</span>. And since that&#039;s a long light there, I&#039;ve gotten bird crap on me several times there waiting to cross.&nbsp; It&#039;s a serious health problem.<br /><br />I want to write a letter or email to someone until they write back. Who should I contact?

It&#039;s more of a fact. <br /><br />Other restaurants in the area do serve large portions as well, but the difference between a national chain restaurant and a locally-owned restaurant is in the quality of the food. Given two portions of equal quantity, I&#039;d rather have the one with more vegetables, spices, herbs, etc in it, and that didn&#039;t come from a truck in the midwest whenever possible.<br /><br />Plus chain restaurants are an eyesore in this neighborhood.
