				I wonder what &quot;sleeping accommodations&quot; means in this context.<br /><br />(https://newyorkyimby.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/40-18-76th-Street-in-Elmhurst-Queens-1024x489.jpg)<br /><br />https://newyorkyimby.com/2020/10/permits-filed-for-40-18-76th-street-in-elmhurst-queens.html<br /><br />Permits have been filed for a 12-story mixed-use building at 40-18 76th Street in Elmhurst, Queens. Located between Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue, the through lot is two blocks east of the Roosevelt Avenue-Jackson Heights subway station, serviced by the 7, E, M, F, and R trains. Maxim Properties under the Broadway Roosevelt Junction LLC is listed as the owner behind the applications.<br /><br />The proposed 120-foot-tall development will yield 121,080 square feet, with 105,276 square feet designated for community facility space and 15,804 square feet for commercial space. Components include retail, community facility, and non-profit institutions with sleeping accommodations and accessory offices. The structure will have 104 rooms, however the square footage is unknown. The concrete-based structure will also have a cellar, a 20-foot-long rear yard, and 36 enclosed parking spaces.<br /><br />Martin Kapell of Think Architecture &amp; Design is listed as the architect of record.<br /><br />Demolition permits have not been filed yet. An estimated completion date has not been announced.

				Reality check. <br /><br />Hotels are closing down by the dozens in NY. <br /><br />It&#039;s a homeless shelter.

				Glad to see this building go at least. <br /><br />With hotels closing, it’s too bad they couldn’t convert some of them to shelters and needed facilities&nbsp; before building new ones from scratch.

				Based on the history of the architect (https://newyorkyimby.com/category/think-architecture-design) it is probably affordable housing or emergency housing.

				<br />I haven&#039;t read this thread thoroughly so not sure what crap I&#039;m stepping into here, but FWIW...<br /><br />The hotel going up on roosie at 91st is currently 4 storeys/stories and an entire block. In this violent crime, visible vice area (prostitution in the high 80s noticeably increasing), this is not very encouraging.<br /><br />cc: thread &quot;NYC&#039;s Future&quot;
