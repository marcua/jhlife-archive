				I currently use a combination of freshly made chicken with brown rice and carrots as well as Wellness dry food mixed in with some wet food ...also Wellness. I was wondering if anyone knows of any comparisons regarding home made and store bought with regard to nutritional balance

				Horatio is a puggle who seems to have a ravenous appetite. She loves milk bone biscuits as a treat but it doesn&#039;t prevent her from fainting on the floor in order to get a bite from whatever is on my dinner plate. I sometimes give her peanut butter on the biscuit as an extra. I switched her to &quot;Wellness Lite&quot; because I think she is getting&nbsp; over weight....but her body type is stocky...and then I feel guilty.

				Been there, done that with respect to the guilt about possibly over feeding.&nbsp; A few people have told me that my dog is chubby, but Jacks are muscular, so I think people are mistaking muscle for fat. ::)<br /><br />Peanut butter is an awesome snack.&nbsp; Protein, and dogs love it!&nbsp; It also happens to be a favorite snack of mine, so I usually share.
