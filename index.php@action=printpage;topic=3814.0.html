				It was a fun bar- I shot darts there in the 70s. It was next to the donut shop and a decent pizza place that was open late.

				I went here a few times in the early - mid eighties.&nbsp; At this time it was a bucket of blood.&nbsp; I think I was there about 5-6 times and there were fights inside or outside a few of those times.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure when it closed but it was probably sometime in the mid - late eighties.&nbsp; The pizzeria that was either next door or a few doors down was Joey D&#039;s

I worked there and and their other stor on 74th st. from 1979 to 1987,&nbsp; and then again about 6 months in 89 or so.&nbsp; Bobby Muller olso worked there in the 70&#039;s to early 80&#039;s.<br /><br />Preacher<br /><br />

Naaaaa... that was a mild bar compared to the place I used hang regularly.&nbsp; Hughies Tavern on the north side of Roosevelt Ave, a half block before Junction Blvd.&nbsp; THAT was a literal &quot;bucket of blood&quot;.<br /><br />Preacher<br /><br />

				I shot darts for them in 76-78 I think. The name Bobby Mueller sounds familiar. We had a decent team with a few characters.&nbsp;
