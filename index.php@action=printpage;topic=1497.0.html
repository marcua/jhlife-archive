				Can anyone recommend a realtor that handles rentals in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to look at some rental apartments to get an idea of what&#039;s on the market.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently in Manhattan and would like to try out JH.&nbsp; Lease expires the end of this year, but I need to make a decision soon.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Call Ricardo at 718 Realty.&nbsp; He is a great guy.&nbsp; I have worked with many real estate agents and he is by far the best.&nbsp; He is honest, patient, and takes time to answer all questions, tell you about the neighborhood, and give advice.&nbsp; If you are able to clearly tell him what you are looking for, he will take you to apartments that you will like.&nbsp; His fee is one month&#039;s rent.&nbsp; I worked with him when I moved here in May.&nbsp;

				For the Washington Plaza at 73-12 35th Avenue, one of the best rental buildings in the neighborhood, I think you need to contact Realty Connection (http://www.realtyconnectionny.com/) in Forest Hills, 718-575-1234.

				Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to go take a look at the Washington Plaza this weekend.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t contacted the realtor yet, but if I like what I see, that will be the next step.&nbsp; Certainly quite a debate has gone on here vis-a-vis JH realtors!&nbsp; It&#039;s quite dizzying!

				Yeah I second the Washington Plaza suggestion.&nbsp; The people that work there are great and maintenance requests are fulfilled right away.&nbsp; Eileen at &quot;the Realty Connection&quot; (Forest Hills) made the process go by really quickly.&nbsp; Plus the fountains are cool.

				Just seconding Eileen at Realty Connections. She got a place for my mother in Kew Gardens, it was quick easy and painless. She&#039;s a good egg that Eileen :) <br /><br />
