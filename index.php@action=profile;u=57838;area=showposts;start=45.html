That no-one ever changes their mind. Ever.&nbsp; No matter how much debate or logic or persuasion by posters. I believe that in the history of the internet, not a single person has been swayed by the arguments of another poster. <br /><br />It seems to be an immutable law. On the internet, a mind that&#039;s made up...stays made up.<br /><br />This includes politics, open streets, plane noise etc, etc. You name it.<br /><br />Thank you to this forum for teaching me the important lesson...that it is futile to counter...or even debate... with people online.<br /><br />Mostly, that only leads to anger from others that their world view is not being upheld. <br /><br />As this forum comes to a close...I reiterate that this wonderful learning curve, (the forum) has been invaluable. For my future online. Much appreciated to everyone for teaching me.<br /><br />I have also learned that being online is, however, excellent to giving voice to a person&#039;s own opinion. As long as they don&#039;t expect&nbsp; to change others&#039; mindsets. Which I definitely now have much experience in knowing is impossible in an online environment. <br /><br />And also being very aware that some folks get very mad at you when you don&#039;t agree with them.<br />(Psychologically, somehow, online, their world view is threatened)<br />&nbsp;<br />That being said, <br /><br />HOORAY for the OPEN STREET OF 34TH AVE. It is the exact right size IMO.<br /><br />And HOORAY for the life long lessons I have learned on this online forum...which I will take into the future!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
