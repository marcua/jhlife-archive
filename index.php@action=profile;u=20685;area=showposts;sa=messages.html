					There is also a couple that hangs out at the 82nd and Northern Blvd Q33 bus shelter. I don&#039;t think I ever seen them sober. They are always slumped over, bright red and swollen. I&#039;m surprised the fire house does not do anything about this since it is literally in their backyard.

Someone might have a rolling cart with ice cream, and that probably has a permit, but the others definitely do not. Most do pay taxes, but it&#039;s most likely at a rate similar to any other cash business - lots of honor system going on. <br /><br />Just some info, you cannot legally obtain a mobile vending permit anymore. The waiting list is 15+ years, and you cannot get on the list anymore. If you want a permit, you can get one for $400 a week, or $20,000 for 2 years -- current prices. This may or not be illegal b/c permits are non-transferable. <br /><br />And if you are worried about the cleanliness... just think about what happens when your food goes through the closed off back-kitchens of every TGIFridays. I had friends who worked there in HS... these are the people you DO NOT want touching your food. Transparency is your best protection, and word of mouth - not a card with a picture on it. <br /><br />--But yeah, I want to see what happens when the police start showing up and giving them tickets. I know some people would defend them, probably create a scene. It&#039;s an interesting issue. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A course are required to get a license to serve food. After completing you will have a knowledge of food temperature and proper handling according to city guidelines. <br /><br />I completely agree with transparency being the best protection. However, if i get sick at a TGIFridays or from a proper documented food establishment I have more options than a &quot;business&quot; that don&#039;t have a paper trail and/or proper credentials.

					I have mixed emotions about this...<br /><br />I been wanting to give them a try but have no idea how and what to order. I enjoy the fact that it brings a sense of community and variety. <br /><br />I also noticed that most if not all of the food vendors don&#039;t have the proper credentials. This makes me think twice about purchasing.

					I think I may have genuine answer to this. I was born and raised in JH and went to Upstate NY for college than to LA for work. After ten years of being gone here are my thoughts:<br /><br />- Early to mid 90&#039;s - I was in junior high at IS 145. It was a rude and quick awakening from elementary school. I disliked it a lot. I was in the honors program and I remember kids getting coats, book bags, bus passes and shoes stolen from them. I had a knife put to my face since the kids wanted my Jansport backpack. The school had minimal supervision when classes concluded. Myself and a few classmates were robbed more times than we liked. Keep in mind that these kids are the same age and attended the same school. My parents visited with the dean many times and nothing was really done. My friends and I also hated walking home from class since we didn&#039;t want any trouble. During this era there were a lot of kids hanging around Gianni&#039;s pizzeria since they had an arcade set up. These kids would always try to get quarters from other kids to continue playing the video game. <br /><br />- Mid to late 90&#039;s - Went to HS in LIC and I loved it. The area and the student body was day and night compared to IS 145. I excelled and really enjoyed neighborhoods such as LIC, Astoria and Sunnyside. I got to experience something outside of JH since my HS friends lived all over. During this time I noticed that kids in JH (same kids that robbed others) started getting into graffiti and other escalated troubles. I remember them verbally abusing the former IS 145 vice principle who lived on 82nd street. They threw eggs at her home whenever they got a chance. The neighborhood shifted in a negative way in my opinion. The house right next to Ben&#039;s Barber Shop became a drug house that sold weed to everyone and a mom and pop video store on northern and 83rd was a front for a cocaine dealer. As I got older I noticed more and more negatives and how petty incidents became escalated. <br /><br />- 2000&#039;s - Left JH for college in upstate ny and I loved it. The people, houses, neighborhoods was all well kept. It was the white picket fence community that I always wanted. After college I got a job in West LA. 1000x&#039;s better than JH. Got financially better paying job in the NYC. Decided to move into my investment property in JH that I obtained right after college. <br /><br />- Present days - Community shock when I moved back. Some changed for the better and some for the worst. I enjoy seeing more attractive store fronts on Northern. It could be me living in West LA and Upstate that totaled 10 years but I feel that people lack respect here. I always say the true residents in JH are &quot;good&quot; it&#039;s just JH gets a lot of visitors that hang out here. I hate the illegal sub divided apartments since it brings in a certain class of people that cannot originally afford to live in JH. I feel terrible for the women that have to deal with all the whistling and rude comments they receive (especially on Roosevelt). I find it said how the public garbage bins are always filled with household trash. <br /><br />Currently, I am looking for rent out my house once again and look for a new development condo in LIC. JH will always be part of me but I think it needs a lot of attention and TLC to make it better. It is too one dimensional. I noticed a lot of the senior homeowners are putting for sale signs up for the same reason. I applaud groups that are trying to make the area better but we are a small group. In my opinion the main obstacle are greedy landlords who sub divide apartments. I am looking to start a family soon to and I don&#039;t think JH will be ideal for me to do so. It is unfortunate because I grew up here and I don&#039;t want my kids to experience a knife to his/her face.

We don&#039;t even put cans that can be redeemed in our backyards anymore. We resorted to taking the redeemable cans to the curbside on our assigned day. I figured if the well runs dry people won&#039;t come back; I never been more wrong. We both even have security cameras but they just don&#039;t care. They even came in when my Labrador was running around playing with a coconut lol... When I tell them to leave I am not sure if they fully understand what I am trying to say. <br /><br />

The only problem with that is the other recycles won&#039;t fit. I current have 3 garbage cans.<br /><br />- 1 for garage <br />- 1 for papers &amp; card boards<br />- 1 for metals, cans and bottles<br /><br />What&#039;s worse is when I take out my trash and recyclables I have to make sure to tie a lose knot for the metal recycle trash bag. If not the can and bottle scavengers will rip holes throughout the bag to get a can.&nbsp; When the sanitation worker swings the bag into the truck it ends up ripping completely and cans, bottles, jugs, metals just flies all over the place and all over the street.

					Extremely annoying - don&#039;t see how this type of gorilla marketing can be effective. What&#039;s more annoying is having to sweep up all the flyers in front of my house after they were distributed and discarded. <br /><br />Spray the imprinted area with windex and scrape it off with a razor blade (above pic).

					I was wondering what is the best way to handle can and bottle collectors that roam into my backyard. I recently moved back from LA and I don&#039;t recall this happening as much 10 years ago. <br /><br />Not only does this happen everyday but it can happen numerous times a day. Like most JH homeowners I have a shared driveway that is gated. My next door neighbor is the owner as well. We have our driveway gates closed at all times. We don&#039;t want to lock the gates since it can be an inconvenience. <br /><br />I asked the same handful of ladies to leave many times but they always find their way back. I understand that they are just looking for cans but the fact that a stranger walks into my yard can get a bit annoying. <br /><br />Do any homeowners also have this problem? If so, what attempts were made to prevent this from happening?

					Hello residents,<br /><br />It is customary to provide a brief introduction when joining a new forum so here&#039;s mine - <br /><br />I am a 32 male and been a JH resident for 21 years. I moved away for college (Upstate, NY) for 5 years and than moved to LA for another 5 due to work. I recently moved back to the area and I can honestly say a lot has changed and at the same time a lot stayed the same. The changes in my opinion are mostly for the better. Currently my wife and I are getting ourselves situated within the neighborhood. She has never lived in JH and is adjusting rapidly. <br /><br />I remember when 78th Street park (Travers Park) was littered with broken malt liquor bottles and was a popular hang out for kids who are looking for trouble. To my amazement the community and city efforts have taken back the park and made it look amazing. The farmers market something I look forward to Sunday mornings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Public School 145 now requires attire standards which is great. From what I heard from the 711 owner the student body has gotten a lot better due to a better principle. I remember the early 90&#039;s and how kids use to get their Jansports, sneakers, coats taken from them by other students. <br /><br />Overall my impression is &quot;improved&quot; but in my opinion the Roosevelt area still needs a few light years.
