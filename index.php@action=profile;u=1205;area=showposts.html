You didn&#039;t listen or read about the crime, but still said ..how do you know they weren&#039;t hanging across the street? and I answered you <br /><br />Well I lived 4 blocks from Denman street and it was full of Haitains . I should know, since I shared alter boy duties with a good buddy Jean . who lived there .&nbsp; We had Cerole masses at St Bart&#039;s&nbsp; BTW this is the late 70&#039;s early 80&#039;s&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m off for the weekend , so have a good one

No not sensitive, just wondering where the &#039;tude is coming from. Second, no I had not read the article, saw the video, but with no sound (good enough excuse). I was going by they comments. Third, I see many &quot;black kids&quot; around morning, noon and night, never thought for a minute that they didn&#039;t live around here. Fourth, I dont recall when this happend, but on the weekends, they have &quot;Teen Bashes&quot; around here that finish around maybe 2 o&#039;clock, and when I go pick up my daughter, I see all the teenagers of every race. <br /><br />So please next time, easy with sarcasam (sp?).<br /><br /><br />GO YANKEES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is what you said :<br />WOW, who said he was followed, maybe those lowlives were hiding out across the street or something.

They all live in the Co-ops in the historic district ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Cmon pally ..let&#039;s be real here..African Americans don&#039;t have any real presence in JH. Back in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s you had a block on the &quot;other side&quot; Denman Street was Haitian . But other then that . you have to travel to East Elmhurst&nbsp; to find African Americans <br />Fourth point ...It happened on a Sunday at 3am.. Don&#039;t know too many teens hanging out at 3am on a sunday night<br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s Go Mets...l&nbsp; :tickedoff: <br />&nbsp;

A friend of mine has a family owned pub there. Around 1am saturday, I&#039;m outside talking to a few people , when I see a &quot;hipster&quot; walking and talking on his cell phone. Next , I see 3 kids, walking behind him. They weren&#039;t talking..or even looking at each other. I said to my buddy, they&#039;re going rob that guy. he agreed, so we walked behind them. When they saw we were watching them, we had no jackets on, they crossed the street. We called the hipster over and told him what was just about to happen to him. he had no clue<br />Moral of the story...watch yourselves at ALL times&nbsp; &nbsp;[/list]<br /><br />Another thing is watch out for your neighbors , this guy I&nbsp; was talking about above was about to be mugged by 3 eminem lookalikes :2funny:&nbsp; But me and my buddy didn&#039;t let that happen. So look out for people , even if they&#039;re not looking out for themselves&nbsp; :police:<br /><br />

If you&#039;re street smart , you make it harder for stick up kids to operate. So instead of mugging a person who has been drinking at 3 am. They have to mug someone coming home from work at midnight. That increases the chances that these people will get caught.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Where did you grow up ?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m 6 foot, weigh 235 lbs,&nbsp; lift weights 4 times a week. Shaved head the whole nine. And you know what , when I go out drinking , I save 10 bucks , so I can get home without any incidents . If you want to take chances..go ahead.

It&#039;s a 24-hour city ... lots of people come home late, and for many different reasons. Maybe he was working. Maybe he was out celebrating. Does it really matter? There seems to be a certain blame-the-victim sentiment being voiced. <br /><br />We should all expect and demand the right to get home safe in our neighborhood, regardless of the hour. <br /><br />Has anyone been caught? The video certainly captures the full faces of two of the attackers, and a silhouette of the third, so it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to identify them. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;Yes its a 24 hour city. And guess what ? Late night is when most muggings occur. And Marcus why do people rob people at night ? Because they&#039;re are less people out, and most people coming home at that time have been drinking. And yes muggers look for easy prey. Yes you&#039;re right, you should be able to do whatever you want, but this isn&#039;t fantasy island. Go ask some people who lived in JH/Elmhurst and Corona what it was like during the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
