Moses, the erratic all-powerful god of 20th century New York planning, did one of his good deeds here, creating a vast, open public space that encompasses a number of attractions, including the Queens Museum of Art, the New York Hall of Science, and the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, where the U.S. Open is held each year.<br /><br />What happens inside the walls of those institutions, though, isnâ€™t nearly as interesting as what happens outside. Flushing Meadows may not be the most beautiful park in New York â€“ it is mostly flat and featureless, surrounded by highways and short on amenities â€“ but it is one of the best-used. This is the scene of countless cricket matches, soccer rivalries, volleyball games, and barbecues. It is a true peopleâ€™s park, used by citizens who may not have much in the way of material wealth, but who sure know how to have a good time with what they do have.<br /><br />Now Mayor Michael Bloombergâ€™s administration has a big plan to â€œimproveâ€ Flushing Meadows yet again. The latest scheme is calling for a professional soccer stadium that seats 25,000, the construction of which would displace all those people who are already playing soccer, and a 1.4 million square-foot shopping mall at the parkâ€™s edge.<br /><br />The plan has come under attack from many neighborhood residents and from the New York Times, where Michael Powell wrote eloquently about what he calls the &quot;upstairs/downstairs&quot; class divide between the parks of the rich â€“ such as Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge Park, and the High Line â€“ and the parks of the poor, mostly in the outer boroughs:<br /><br /><em>[W]ould the mayor, whose mansion is steps from Central Park, conceive of asking the worthies on the Central Park Conservancy to underwrite its operations by placing a professional soccer stadium in Sheep Meadow?<br /><br />To ask is to know the answer.</em><br /><br />The &quot;authenticity&quot; in Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park canâ€™t easily be commodified. You arenâ€™t going to get tourists and their dollars to show up at a pickup volleyball game played by Ecuadoran immigrants. So the city is looking to sell something else: the acreage where the people of New York have come together and asserted their right to &quot;inhabit a space.&quot;<br /><br />Is Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park perfect? No. Could the space be improved? Yes, and it should. But not for some imagined class of people who will come to shop at some imagined mall, or for the financial benefit of Major League Soccer. It should be improved for the people who are already out there, giving the place life every day of the week.

Residents have spoken out against the proposals for stadiums at Flushing Meadows Corona Park at several meetings in recent weeks. It is clear the proposals are not popular ones. <br /><br />&nbsp; Yes, a Major League Soccer stadium could bring a new focus on Queens. And yes, the expansion of the USTAâ€™s Billie Jean King Tennis Center could greatly enhance the annual U.S. Open experience. Taken one at a time, there may not be any opposition to the proposals. <br /><br />&nbsp; The problem arises when these proposals stand side-by-side at the same time. It is clearly a case of too much all at once, and the opponents of the proposals have a legitimate gripe with the potential loss of park space in the Boroughâ€™s most prominent park. <br /><br />&nbsp; As the opposition grows, it is time for our elected officials to step in and fix this issue. Instead of focusing on pushing through both new stadiums, look at what would be best for the residents of Queens, including the ones who have been vocally opposed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp; Itâ€™s time to do the right thing for the people of Queens.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.queenstribune.com/inour/Our%20Opinion_100412.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenstribune.com/inour/Our%20Opinion_100412.html</a>

Included among the groups are the Asian Americans For Equality, Eastern New York State Soccer Association, Jackson Heights Green Alliance, Jackson Heights Beautification Group, Make the Road New York, New Immigrant Community Empowerment, Queens Community House and Queens Congregations United for Action.<br /><br />â€œCommunity input regarding all uses and proposed redesigns of (the park) must be included before any development project moves forward,â€ the statement said, echoing the residentâ€™s anger at what they believe is an attempt to ignore their concerns and push down their throat a project which is not what they want or need.<br /><br />â€œWe are trying to get a meeting with the mayorâ€™s office about the communityâ€™s concern,â€ said Joseph McKellar, executive director of the Queens Congregations United for Action.<br /><br />In a June 13 press conference, Bloomberg and the New York Economic Development Corporation announced a revised plan for Willets Point. The previous one, which had been approved in 2008 after extensive pubic review, was no longer valid. The new developments, backed by a partnership of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, were decided with little or no community input.<br /><br />The city, the coalition said, is considering three development projects to be built on parkland: a 1,400,000-square foot mall, two new stadiums and concert venues, 9,000 additional parking spots including several new parking garages and new roads. The plan requires years of construction and dozens of acres of parkland would be lost to private corporations.<br /><br />The communityâ€™s concern should not come as a surprise. After all Flushing Meadowsâ€”Corona Park is the biggest green space in Queens and for 72 years it has been used by millions of families from across the borough. The surrounding neighborhoods depend on the park as some of the only open space in Queens. Residents are some of the poorest in the city: 75% are people of color and 40% live in poverty.<br /><br />â€œWe want to make clear that the community is not against development and the creation of jobs,â€ McKellar said. â€œWhat we want to see is responsible development and good jobs.â€<br /><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/locals-blast-bloomberg-flushing-park-plans-article-1.1172899#ixzz28FSnnG9Z" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/locals-blast-bloomberg-flushing-park-plans-article-1.1172899#ixzz28FSnnG9Z</a><br />&nbsp;<br />WILL SWEENEY <a href="mailto:willsweeney@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">willsweeney@yahoo.com</a>

The MLS stadium project would require up to 13 acres of land east of the Unisphere, placing a 25,000 seat-stadium on top of what is currently Industry Pond.<br /><br />The USTA project would call for the expansion of the National Tennis Center by an acre and would reroute United Nations Avenue North around the expanded center.<br /><img src="http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/10/packed-town-hall-13491785563707.JPG/image640x480.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />The Willets West plan, submitted by the owners of the New York Mets, would call for the construction of a 1.4 million square-foot shopping mall on the western parking lot of Citi Field, where Shea Stadium used to stand. Although the land is currently used by the Mets, it is still owned by the city and is legally considered parkland.<br /><img src="http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/10/dromm-ferreras-13491785221924.JPG/image640x480.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />City Councilwoman Julissa Fererras, whose district includes the park, said that she was wary of the mayor&#039;s rush to allocate the land, and that she wanted to make sure the community&#039;s voice was heard in all development discussions.<br /><br />&quot;Every inch of parkland that we lose is parkland that we will not get back,&quot; Ferreras said.<br /><br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm was more forceful, saying: &quot;You can&#039;t just ignore our community and take our parkland away.&quot;<br /><br />While Major League Soccer has offered to renovate the soccer fields that exist around the proposed stadium site, residents are still wary of a deal, especially with the other two projects occuring simultaneously.<br /><br />Margardia Guilarte, who owns a soccer league that plays there, said that the developments could ruin her business.<br /><br />&quot;They&#039;re not being clear on everything,&quot; said Guilarte, whose father used to own a league in the park, &quot;Maybe MLS isn&#039;t bad, but what about the other two? It&#039;s not one developer, it&#039;s many.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s going to kill the park.&quot;<br /><br />Even with the city&#039;s previous success at sweeping away public protest to build Yankee Stadium and the Barclays Center, residents said they believed that at the very least, they could earn a seat the table for discussions on the project.<br /><br />&quot;We have to hope we do,&quot; Finn said.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121002/willets-point/residents-rail-against-flushing-meadows-park-development-plans#ixzz28CED1825" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121002/willets-point/residents-rail-against-flushing-meadows-park-development-plans#ixzz28CED1825</a>

She lacks the high-stepping strut of Central Park and the hipster slouch of Prospect Park.<br /><br />And she has no Daddy Warbucks conservancy to shower her in gilt and so pay for a revitalizing face-lift.<br /><br />Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is a homely beauty, a many-acre stepchild of two Worldâ€™s Fairs, stepping gingerly between noisy highways and stadiums and a polluted bay. All she possesses are a handsome Unisphere, a Hall of Science, a zoo, an art museum and tens of thousands of immigrant New Yorkers who pour out of the densely packed streets of Corona, Elmhurst, Flushing and Jackson Heights to run across her soccer fields, seek shade under her still-adolescent trees and stroll, bike and roller skate around her lakes.<br /><br />Ask Olaris Gutierrez of Corona if her two children play in this park and she laughs.<br /><br />â€œOf course! All the time.â€<br /><br />Is it crowded?<br /><br />Her eyes widen. â€œSo crowded! On weekends, your elbows touch other elbows.â€<br /><br />Now this park faces threats from the city that should care for her. The Bloomberg administration has in mind multiple insults. In pursuit of its Xanadu dream for Willets Point, it wants to let the owners of the Mets and the Related Companies build a huge shopping mall on the parkâ€™s western end, which admittedly is nothing more than a vast parking lot now.<br /><br />They are intent on letting the United States Tennis Association put up new parking lots and new roads. And, most perilous, city officials seem intent on letting Major League Soccer build a 25,000-seat stadium not on the parkâ€™s edge, but at its very core.<br /><br />Itâ€™s as if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in distorted homage to â€œMen in Black,â€ wanted to park a flying saucer here, obliterating soccer fields and a pond.<br /><br />It is a fact of 21st-century life that the upstairs/downstairs class divide applies with great force to New York Cityâ€™s parks. To ride your bike from Brooklyn Bridge Park to Battery Park to Hudson River Park, and perhaps stop and take a stroll on the High Line, is to experience New York as Paris, beautifully kept parks with gardeners and omnipresent officers.<br /><br />To ride out to the Shore Park by the Verrazano Bridge and east to Marine Park or to bike up to the cityâ€™s largest park Pelham Bay is often to bounce along roads as rutted as any in backwoods Vermont. I walked Flushing Meadows-Corona Park with Donovan Finn, a passionate 41-year-old resident of Jackson Heights and a professor of environmental studies at Stony Brook University. He pointed out lawns scarred by hardscrabble patches of dirt, soccer goal posts rusting, and the Fountain of the Planets surrounded by acres of asphalt.<br /><br /><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/10/02/nyregion/yGOTHAM-2/yGOTHAM-2-articleInline.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />We walked beneath a stand of adolescent sycamores that would be destroyed by the tennis center. We came to a stop by the soccer fields, crowded on this weekday, which would disappear during years of construction.<br /><br />â€œThis is where my 3 Â½-year-old son runs around the fountain,â€ he said. â€œThis is our park. Why is it O.K. to do this to us?â€<br /><br />City officials hint at bags of cash for this plain beauty of a park; perhaps the soccer stadium could provide it with a revenue stream. The league might eventually rebuild even prettier fields. Maybe, perhaps, could be, some day.<br /><br />Why have mayors not demanded that the United States Tennis Association and the taxpayer-subsidized New York Mets pay fees to this much-abused park? And would the mayor, whose mansion is steps from Central Park, conceive of asking the worthies on the Central Park Conservancy to underwrite its operations by placing a professional soccer stadium in Sheep Meadow?<br /><br />To ask is to know the answer. More than a few residents of Manhattan had made clear they did not favor placing this stadium along the Hudson River.<br /><br />Four years ago, the parks department released a strategic plan for Flushing Meadows. It is a dispatch from a different, green-edged age of Bloomberg. It â€œre-envisionsâ€ a â€œnew greener landscapeâ€ with less pavement, cleaned-up lakes and a spectacular Fountain of Industry edged by lawns and playgrounds. And it suggests that the city force baseball owners and tennis barons to ante up their fair share of fees.<br /><br />To read this report is to feel that surge of optimism when New Yorkers dream grandly of public spaces. As the former mayor of BogotÃ¡, Colombia, Enrique PeÃ±alosa, a champion of parks across the globe, once said: Public space is for living, kissing and playing. â€œIts value canâ€™t be measured with economics or mathematics; it must be felt with the soul.â€<br /><br />No hint of such vision was on offer last week in a crowded public school auditorium, where the Economic Development Corporation came to solicit comment on its plan for the shopping mall. A city interpreter began by standing and explaining in Spanish to a vastly Latino crowd that it would offer no simultaneous translation into Spanish.<br /><br />But, he noted brightly, you are welcome to use the agencyâ€™s Spanish language Web site.<br /><br />Ms. Gutierrez sat in that audience, desperate to hold to whatâ€™s left of her childrenâ€™s shrinking park. She fears a done deal.<br /><br />â€œWhy does the mayor come to Queens with this idea?â€ she asked. â€œPeople in Queens, we need good jobs, vacations, sick days and parks. We need beautiful, beautiful parks â€” just like people everywhere in this city.â€ <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/nyregion/in-queens-an-oasis-neglected-by-the-city.html?ref=nyregion" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/nyregion/in-queens-an-oasis-neglected-by-the-city.html?ref=nyregion</a>

It also has to go through the city land review process and receive state legislative approval.<br /><br />â€œBig pieces of park space are much more valuable than a bunch of little pieces of park land â€” which is what would replace it,â€ Finn said.<br /><br />Finn said he is also concerned there will be no land swap for property used for new roads in the park to accommodate the stadiums â€” a claim that was dismissed by tennis and soccer officials.<br /><br />U.S. Tennis Association spokesman Chris Widmaier said only three-quarters of an acre would be lost in the tennis centerâ€™s expansion â€” and the land would come from a service road in the park.<br /><br />The expansion would include replacing one stadium and building a new one.<br /><br />â€œThis minimal impact on the park will allow the U.S. Open to thrive and remain the economic engine that it currently is,â€ Widmaier said.<br /><br />Major League Soccer officials previously said they were looking to build a 25,000-seat stadium on eight acres at the Fountains of Industry site in the park. That estimate later ballooned to up to 13 acres.<br /><br />But officials insisted that they are committed to finding replacement park land.<br /><br />â€œWe are in the process of starting conversations with community leaders to identify parcels,â€ MLS spokeswoman Risa Heller said in a statement. â€œMLS is also committed to replacing and upgrading existing community soccer fields as well.â€<br /><br />State Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst) said the MLS stadium would be an economic boon to Queens.<br /><br />â€œIt is [proposed for] a space thatâ€™s really not being utilized to the best of its potential,â€ said Peralta, who added each project should be evaluated individually on the strength of its own merits.<br /><br />Theo Oshiro, spokesman for the Fairness Coalition of Queens, made up of several local groups concerned about the new projects at Flushing Meadows, said this is a low-income, minority area that doesnâ€™t have park space to spare.<br /><br />â€œThese changes would impact the lives of the people that use the park every day,â€ he said. â€œWhy hasnâ€™t something like this been proposed for Central Park or Prospect Park?â€<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/plans-new-queens-stadiums-spark-fears-parkland-lost-article-1.1171506#ixzz282khKT68" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/plans-new-queens-stadiums-spark-fears-parkland-lost-article-1.1171506#ixzz282khKT68</a>

Tony Avella (D-Bayside), Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-Elmhurst), Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), and Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-St. Albans) joined hundreds of residents for a town hall meeting held at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Corona.<br /><br />&nbsp; Officiated by Monsignor Thomas Healy, pastor of the 10,000 member church, the meeting hosted numerous public testimonies against the string of the proposed plans as well as discussions and suggestions for alternative improvements.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œWe are the closest community to Willets Point. Thatâ€™s why we are here tonight,â€ Healy said. â€œFamilies in Corona need living wage jobs, not massive stadiums or shopping malls that will create poverty-wage jobs and only serve the interests of wealthy developers.â€ <br /><br />&nbsp; In addition to protesting against the Willets Point development Mayor Mike Bloomberg announced in June, which would include the construction of a 1.4 million square foot shopping mall on public parkland, residents in attendance also voiced concerns over proposals made by the United States Tennis Association and Major League Soccer, who are currently lobbying for park alienation rights.<br /><br />&nbsp; The USTAâ€™s proposal is expected to face a public review this fall and if approved, would call for a $500 million expansion of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Plans would include the construction of two new stadiums, two parking garages and relocation of seven tournament courts among other minor infrastructure and utility improvements.<br /><br />&nbsp; Meanwhile, MLS, which has yet to strike a final deal with the City, is seeking support from the City Council to build a $300 million stadium on the site of what is now the Pool of Industry at the park. <br /><br />&nbsp; Supported by State Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst), who did not attend the town hall meeting, the stadium would call for the filling of the pool and incorporation of a concert venue on park grounds. <br /><br />&nbsp; â€œA privately funded soccer stadium to replace a big hole in the ground filled with dirty water is a good deal for soccer fans and the park-goers who would get to enjoy the many upgrades to the park,â€ Peralta said. â€œAnd we can certainly use the construction, game-day and permanent jobs that the stadium would create.â€<br /><br />&nbsp; While Peraltaâ€™s office vouched for the plenty of folks who support the construction of the stadium and the upgrades to the park that would go with it, Ferreras said that the poor timing of the MLS may be the cause of some of the existing community opposition.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIt almost feels like everything is being rushed,â€ Ferreras said. <br /><br />&nbsp; <strong>In a comprehensive video presentation given at the meeting, Donovan Finn, a Queens resident and visiting assistant professor of policy planning and design at Stony Brook University, stated that if each of the proposals are approved, Flushing Meadowsâ€™ public park space would be reduced from 1,255 acres to a mere couple hundred acres.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIn my professional opinion, I think all of these plans are deeply flawed,â€ Finn said. â€œThe biggest problem is that all of these developers are acting as if the other plans do not exist.â€ <br /><br />&nbsp; As he concluded his presentation, Finn echoed much of the crowdâ€™s sentiments by urging City officials to take the publicâ€™s concerns into careful consideration before moving forward with plans to alter the park.<br /><br />&nbsp; â€œIf this stuff gets built, it will never be park land again,â€ Finn said. â€œItâ€™s an enormous opportunity to change the course of history.â€ </strong>

Because the sites are on public parkland, any development would need approval from both the City Council and state legislature and would have to mitigate the used land with an equal amount of new parkland in another location within New York City, not necessarily in Queens.<br /><br />Major League Soccer is reportedly eyeing land behind the Hall of Science to build a nine-acre, $300 million, 25,000-seat facility and nine public soccer fields. The league said it would fund renovations of public sports fields within the park, including cricket, soccer and volleyball fields along with adding parkland to the city.<br /><br />A $500 million project is planned to update and revitalize the U.S. Tennis Associationâ€™s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center with two new stadiums and two parking garages.<br /><br />Lastly, a 1,400,000-square-foot shopping mall on public land was proposed for Willets West, a section of the park now used for parking next to Citi Field, which is on public land, and Willets Point, which is not on park property.<br /><br />â€œThere is some confusion, but Willets West is on public park land,â€ said Joseph McKellar, a spokesman with the Queens Congregations United for Action.<br /><br />â€œWe use the park to play soccer. Itâ€™s where our children learn to play. We donâ€™t just want to watch soccer, we want to play,â€ Make the Road New York Deputy Director Theo Oshiro said.<br /><br />Many people cheered and clapped when speakers denounced the possible loss of open space, but one retired nurse and Corona resident, Elna Tullock, said all development would be good.<br /><br />â€œThereâ€™s lots of space, but thatâ€™s my opinion,â€ Tullock said. â€œItâ€™s good to have these meetings to express ideas.â€<br /><img src="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qchron.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/1e/21e13882-f0e5-5e1d-bb89-f86329ed5d07/505b355ad7231.image.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Politicians and spokespeople with QCUA, MRNY and several other Queens community organizations who hosted the town hall want to start a conversation wherein the community, which has a large poor and immigrant population, has a say in the future of the park.<br /><br />â€œNeighbors of the park should have a seat at the table and a say in what is happening in their backyard,â€ Oshiro said.<br /><br />Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras (D-East Elmhurst) said she will be meeting with all the developers and they will â€œhave to sellâ€ the proposals to the community<br /><br />â€œEvery inch of developed parkland is park space we wonâ€™t get back,â€ Ferreras said.<br /><br />Although not public land, development at Willets Point, across 126th Street from Citi Field, was also a point of concern. In 2008 the city council approved the Willets Point redevelopment project, which included 2,000 affordable housing units. However, in June of this year Mayor Bloomberg and the Economic Development Corp. announced the Willets West plan and said the affordable houses would be delayed until 2025.<br /><br />â€œThatâ€™s not just. We had a promise,â€ said Our Lady of Sorrows Pastor Thomas Healy, adding that the plan is unfair to neighborhood residents who already live two and three families to one apartment.<br /><br />Auto mechanics who have shops on 126th Street in the Willets Point area are worried about the development, according to Sergio Aguirre, a community organizer for the Sunrise Co-op, a coalition of 60 shops in the Willets Point area.<br /><br />â€œThey want to displace workers like animals,â€ he said, adding that the co-op is asking the government to help with a relocation to Maspeth.<br /><br />All proposals would include constructing more roads and adding more car traffic in the park, Donovan Finn of the Jackson Heights Green Alliance said. MLSâ€™ plans would include a shuttle from the No. 7 train to the proposed soccer stadium.<br /><br />In addition to the eating up of open parkland and increasing traffic, speakers said the proposed developments would bring part-time jobs without benefits when the neighborhood needs â€œgood jobs,â€ Maria Alvarez with MRNY said.<br /><br />Residents broke into small groups and discussed what the park means to them, which for most meant recreation and family. A follow-up meeting will be held on Sept. 27 at PS 19 at 98-02 Roosevelt Avenue at 6:30 p.m.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/neighbors-want-say-in-park-s-future/article_3738a87d-0a25-5994-ace1-842d33255bd4.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/neighbors-want-say-in-park-s-future/article_3738a87d-0a25-5994-ace1-842d33255bd4.html</a>

The entire project will require 0.76 more acres of parkland to be added to the tennis center.<br /><br />And over the summer, Major League Soccer began talking with Queens lawmakers about building a 9-acre stadium on the site of some derelict fountains from the 1964 Worldâ€™s Fair.<br /><br />â€œAll this council is asking for is that we have a voice in the process,â€ Finn said.<br /><br />The coalition distributed pledge cards where those in attendance could sign up to flood 311 with phone calls, hand out informational fliers in the park or even testify at an upcoming hearing about Willets Point.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.timesledger.com/assets/photos/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q3_joeanuta_i.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><em>Javier Valdez and Luz Muy introduce members of the coalition at a rally over development in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Msgr Thomas Healy claps in the background. </em><br /><br />But state Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst) contended that the proposed soccer stadium enjoys widespread in the community, which would seem to contradict the tone of Mondayâ€™s meeting.<br /><br />â€œA privately funded soccer stadium to replace a big hole in the ground filled with dirty water is a good deal for soccer fans and the park-goers who would get to enjoy the many upgrades to the park,â€ he said. â€œAnd we can certainly use the construction, game-day and permanent jobs that the stadium would create.â€<br /><br /><a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/38/willetsprotest_ne_2012_09_20_q.html</a>

Organized by Queens Congregations United for Action (QCUA), and the Fairness Coalition of Queens, they came together with elected officials, clergy, and community leaders to tell Mayor Bloomberg that their park is not for sale to real estate moguls and greedy merchants.<br /><br />â€œFamilies in Corona need living wage jobs and affordable housing, not massive stadiums or shopping malls that will create poverty-wage jobs and only serve the interests of wealthy developers,â€ said Msgr. Thomas Healy, pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows which has 10,000 members whose families depend on the park.<br /><br />Healy was referring to a press conference held last June 15 by Bloomberg and the New York Economic Development Corporation to announced that plans for Willets Point, which had been approved in 2008 after extensive pubic review, had been significantly revised. The new developments, backed by a partnership of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, were decided with little or no community input.<br /><br />The new plan will begin undergoing an additional environmental review later this month and calls for developing public parkland for private use. The idea is to build a 1,400,000-square foot mall, two new stadiums and concert venues, several new parking garages and new roads valued at over three billion dollars. Construction of 2,000 units of affordable housing that were part of the original plan would now be delayed until 2025.<br /><br />In addition, developers representing the New York Mets, the United States Tennis Association and Major League Soccer also want to develop public parkland for private use in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park and are lobbying city and state officials for the right to do so.<br />â€œImagine what would happen if they were proposing to build a stadium and a shopping mall in Central Park or in Prospect Park,â€ said Joseph McKellar, QCUAâ€™s executive director. â€œThe community is really upset, among other things, because the mayor had made a commitment to build affordable housing and now went back on that commitment. They are doing this because they think Latinos, which are the majority in this area, do not have any power.â€<br /><br />For 72 years, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the biggest green space in Queens, has been a place where thousands of families from across the borough come to â€œlearn, play, and build community,â€ McKellar said. The neighborhoods surrounding the park depend on it as some of the only open space in Queens. Resident are some of the poorest in the city: 75% are people of color and 40% live in poverty.<br />â€œThe construction of these developments would mean losing precious parkland used by 20,000 youth and adult recreational soccer players every week from adjacent neighborhoods,â€ McKellar said. â€œBesides, there is real concern about what, if any, benefits these developments would bring to the community.â€<br /><br />As the people gathered at the Corona church made clear Monday night, the community is saying no to the traffic these luxury projects would bring, and to poverty wages and seasonal jobs. What they are struggling for is affordable housing and jobs that pay living wages, not for a group of billionaire developers gutting their park to become even richer.<br /><br />The message from Queens residents to Bloomberg and wealthy developers is clear and to the point: Flushing Meadows-Corona Park belongs to the community and is not for sale.<br />&nbsp;<br />by Albor Ruiz <br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/residents-voice-opposition-massive-development-plans-flushing-meadows-corona-park-article-1.1162125#ixzz26v2aYZ4a" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/residents-voice-opposition-massive-development-plans-flushing-meadows-corona-park-article-1.1162125#ixzz26v2aYZ4a</a>

					FROM NBC NEWS: <br />Neighbors Worry Over Flushing Meadows Development Plans<br /><br />Hundreds of neighbors turned out for a town hall meeting in Corona Monday to voice concerns over redevelopment plans for Flushing Meadows Corona Park.<br /><br />Neighbors are worried that the potential plan to build a soccer stadium in the park -- as well as another plan to replace and expand the facility for the United States Tennis Association -- would take away public park land. <br /><br />&quot;Many folks are saying, we don&#039;t want to only watch soccer, we don&#039;t only want to watch professional athletes play soccer -- we also want our families to actually use the park to play soccer,&quot; said Theo Oshiro of the community group Make the Road New York. <br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re really upset right now that the city&#039;s taking away our space without even asking or letting us know what they&#039;ll do,&quot; said Maria Alvarez of Corona. <br /><br />Major League Soccer says their proposal would replace any park land taken away, as mandated by state policy and federal law.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m hoping that we can find a middle ground and something that&#039;s beneficial to the community, because at the end of the day, it is their park -- they&#039;re going to have to deal with the traffic, they&#039;re going to have to deal with the impasse,&quot; said councilwoman Julissa Ferreras of Queens. <br /><br />City Council gets the final say, and is expected to vote on the first part of the plan next spring. If approved, construction could begin as soon as next summer. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Flushing-Meadows-Development-Town-Hall-Neighbors-Upset-Soccer-Field-Mall-170124556.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Flushing-Meadows-Development-Town-Hall-Neighbors-Upset-Soccer-Field-Mall-170124556.html</a>

					CAPITAL NEW YORK <br />Soccer Won&#039;t Get Queens Stadium Without a Fight<br />by Dana Rubenstein<br /><img src="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/files/FMCP400.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />A Major League Soccer stadium may be a good fit for Flushing Meadows Corona Park and the soccer-loving communities that border it from a marketing perspective, but as a packed Monday night meeting made clear, the project won&#039;t materialize without a fight.<br /><br />&quot;There&#039;s a lot of issues here,&quot; State Senator Tony Avella told Capital, shortly before the meeting began. &quot;You can&#039;t just say, &#039;Oh, that sounds like a great idea.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Why are they choosing our flagship park?&quot; asked Councilman Daniel Dromm, an hour and a half later, talking to a reporter as the meeting at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic church in Corona continued behind him. &quot;Why don&#039;t they put this in Central Park?&quot;<br /><br />Well, why don&#039;t they?<br /><br />&quot;Because they always dump on Queens,&quot; he said. &quot;And this time, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re going to dump on Queens and be able to get away with it.&quot;<br /><br />Beyond Dromm, about 250 people, most of them of people of color, were talking about Flushing Meadows Corona Park, and the developments set to transform it and its environs.<br /><br />This was the first public meeting of the Fairness Coalition of Queensâ€”an amalgam of a dozen or so groups like Make the Road New York and Queens Congregations United for Actionâ€”whose first task, according to Make the Road deputy director Theo Oshiro, will be &quot;making sure there&#039;s a voice for the community&quot; in the ongoing developments impacting Flushing Meadows.<br /><br />Certainly, there&#039;s a lot happening in and around there. In addition to Major League Soccer&#039;s stadium plans, the Bloomberg administration has reached a tentative deal with developers to build a large mall to the west of Citi Field, and new parking lots, some retail and a hotel, (and perhaps also, ultimately, housing) to the stadium&#039;s east, on an industrial swath of land known as the Iron Triangle that now houses small businesses.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the U.S. Tennis Association wants to implement a $500 million expansion of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center that includes two new above-ground parking garages in the park.<br /><br />&quot;In my professional opinion, I think all of these plans are deeply flawed,&quot; said Donovan Finn, an urban planning professor at Stony Brook University, who gave the policy keynote of the night, complete with a slide show, and who argued that Major League Soccer would need at least 20 acres of parkland to build its stadium.<br /><br />Earlier estimates had Major League Soccer requesting fewer than 10 acres.<br /><br />&quot;That&#039;s the new number from what I understand,&quot; said Finn, when asked where he got it.<br /><br />A Major League Soccer spokesperson told Capital that the stadium would need no more than 13 acres, which is both smaller than Finn&#039;s estimate and larger than the original ones.<br /><br />Either way, Major League Soccer will have to overcome several obstacles before it can break ground. It must find replacement parkland elsewhereâ€”a process it has already begunâ€”and then get state approval for the land swap.<br /><br />The stadium will also have to go through a land use review process that entails getting City Council approval.<br /><br />&quot;Out of all the proposals, Major League Soccer is one that the community embraces,&quot; said Councilmember Julissa Ferreras, whose district encompasses the park.<br /><br />But she said the league&#039;s timing is bad, with the stadium proposal coming at the same time as nearby USTA and Citi Field developments.<br /><br />&quot;It almost feels like everything is being rushed,&quot; she said.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/09/6537221/major-league-soccer-wont-get-queens-stadium-without-fight?politics-bucket-headline" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/09/6537221/major-league-soccer-wont-get-queens-stadium-without-fight?politics-bucket-headline</a>

					Wall Street Journal: Sports Plan Faces Fight<br />Community Opposition Swells in Queens Over Proposal for New Arenas and Mall<br />By LAURA KUSISTO<br /><img src="http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-BW929_NYWILL_G_20120912183318.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />An ambitious Bloomberg administration plan to remake a corner of Queens with two professional-league sports arenas and a roughly 1-million-square-foot mall is meeting with unexpected and growing opposition that could stymie the effort.<br /><br />Although the projects are separate from each other, they are all in or near Flushing Meadows Corona Park and have roiled groups that accuse the city of eroding green space without considering the impact of an influx of traffic and thousands of new spectators and shoppers.<br />Importantly, the coalition of about a half-dozen groups has the initial support of the local City Council memberâ€”who, in the tradition of the council, has almost unilateral power to hold up necessary approvals.<br /><br />The challenge could stall the projects, which are among Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#039;s signature development plans: an 8,000-seat U.S. Tennis Association stadium, a possible 25,000-seat Major League Soccer stadiumâ€”both in the parkâ€”and the mall on a gritty swath near Citi Field, across from the park.<br /><br />More likely, it could force new concessions from developers as the groups push the City Council to look at the fallout of all three projects combined when voting on approvals for them individually.<br /><br />&quot;Nobody has created a comprehensive vision of what the future of Flushing Meadows Corona Park is going to look like,&quot; said Javier Valdes, co-executive director of Make the Road New York, part of the coalition.<br /><br />A Bloomberg spokesperson said the projects are vital to reviving the area. &quot;In all of our conversations with Queens community groups, we hear the same message consistently: the borough needs more jobs and economic activity. These projects would meet that need in spectacular fashion and provide employment to thousands of Queens residents,&quot; said spokeswoman Julie Wood.<br /><br />The developers expressed similar sentiment, saying they would work with the community.<br /><br />The Willets Point development already went through an extensive public review and was approved in 2008. But the plan, now backed by a partnership of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, was significantly revised and will begin undergoing an additional environmental review later this month. The USTA proposal is expected to face a review this fall. MLS, which has yet to strike a final deal with the city, also would be required to seek City Council support.<br /><br />Council Member Julissa Ferreras, who represents the area, echoed concerns about the temporary loss of community soccer fields during construction, reduced access to the park, increased traffic, pollution, noise, safety, litter and the impact of the mall on mom-and-pops.<br />&quot;I have an obligation to make sure that our community gets a voice in the processâ€¦The community needs to decide if these three different proposals are a good use of parkland,&quot; Ms. Ferreras said.<br /><br />To be sure, some developers have already promised benefits to the community. MLS has pledged to refurbish public soccer fields on the site, make additional park improvements and minimize disruption, according to people familiar with the matter, which has helped it win support from a number of politicians and community groups.<br /><br />Flushing Meadows Corona Park is the borough&#039;s largest park, where a mostly Latino and Asian immigrant population plays soccer, bikes and picnics. But the shabby, sprawling space has been plagued by funding shortages and neglect, park advocates say.<br /><br />While new stadiums would undoubtedly create strains, they could also be an opportunity to make needed upgrades, some said. &quot;It&#039;s been dependent on the ebbs and flows of public funding, which has led to fairly inconsistent maintenance,&quot; said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks. &quot;There really is an opportunity for partnerships there if these projects are going to go forward.&quot;<br /><br />On a recent sunny afternoon, people enjoying the park expressed both support and concerns about the impact of the new developments. Juan Vidal, 70 years old, who lives in New Rochelle and rides his bike in the park, said he loves soccer but thinks Flushing Meadows is too cramped for a major-league stadium. &quot;They should do it someplace else,&quot; he said.<br /><br />â€”Alison Fox contributed to this article.<br /><br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444426404577647743259180070.html?mod=googlenews" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444426404577647743259180070.html?mod=googlenews</a>
