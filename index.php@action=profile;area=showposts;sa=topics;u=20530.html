					<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong><br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Beautification Group Celebrates<br />10th Annual Summer Sundays in the Park Concert Series June 30, 2014<br /></strong><br />Contact: Beatriz Gil | 917-612-4756 |info@jhbg.org<br /><br />NEW YORK – The Summer Sundays at the Park concert series celebrates a decade of free outdoor music in Jackson Heights. The Jackson Heights Beautification Group has been bringing emerging and established artists to Travers Park every Sunday afternoon for the community to enjoy.<br /><br />“These concerts are a great opportunity to bring the people of Jackson Heights together, no matter their age, income or where they come from, to enjoy a wide range of performances - jazz, rock, Latin, dance and theater,” said Len Maniace, JHBG President and founder of Summer Sundays in the Park.<br /><br />The concert series will kick-off this weekend and will take place on 78th Street between 34th Avenue and Northern Boulevard alongside Travers Park. All concerts begin at 3:30 PM every Sunday from July 6th to August 24th.<br /><br />“The Summer Concert series offers a platform for artists to showcase their musical roots in a very unique space. We have hosted local artists who bring sounds from all over the world,” said concert organizer Carlos Martinez. Previous artists include Grammy nominated artists Red Baraat, a Bhangra party band and Locos Por Juana, a bilingual Latin fusion band.<br /><br />The 2014 summer schedule is as follows:<br /><br /><strong>July 6 - Jackson Heights Orchestra:</strong> Enjoy the sounds of the light classics, jazz, and some fun patriotic music in this organization’s first outdoor concert.<br /><br /><strong>July 13 - Calpulli Mexican Dance Company: </strong>Dancers and musicians from Calpulli Mexican Dance Company turn this park into a stage.<br /><br /><strong>July 20 - Issa Cabrera:</strong> From bossa nova to bolero, samba to jazz, Issa Cabrera wows audiences with lush vocals above infectious Latin rhythms.<br /><br /><strong>July 27 - Band in a Box:</strong> This captivating, modern jazz duo will enchant your senses and take you away from the day-to-day buzz.<br /><br /><strong>August 3 - The Urban Street Gypsys:</strong> This Queens-based high-energy band plays classic rock covers.<br /><br /><strong>August 10 - Sonic Power Pops:</strong> These garage rock revivalists from Jackson Heights breathe new fire into lost gems of three-chord rock ’n’ roll by 1960’s regional bands.<br /><br /><strong>August 17 - Los Colombian Roots:</strong> Carolina Oliveros and Los Colombian Roots explore the traditions of bailes cantaos, a musical genre from the northern Colombian coast.<br /><br /><strong>August 24, 2pm - Theater for the New City:</strong> presents “Emergency” or “The World Takes a Selfie” an operetta for the street.<br /><br />Summer Sundays in the Park is organized by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. Concert Committee: Beatriz Gil, Carlos Martinez, Vinny Mongeluzo, Rebekah Oakes, and Edwin Westley.

This event will feature free art workshops, music, and outdoor art exhibitions to celebrate the Diversity Plaza, the local art scene and the arrival of summer. The co-organizers of this festival are Hibridos Collective and Nitin Mukul, both Jackson Heights artists and curators.<br /><br />This is the second year of the festival, which was initiated by Hibridos Collective, a Jackson Heights-based collaborative working to re-envision underutilized spaces through community-based arts practices. “In collaboration with the Friends of Diversity Plaza we want to build on the local arts community, increase the visibility of artists that live and work in the neighborhood, promote community-based arts and open a dialogue for empowerment through the arts, “ said Beatriz Gil, Hibridos Collective member and one of the festival organizers.<br /><br />“Our community represents one of the most culturally diverse zip codes on the planet. There is no better way to celebrate that diversity than the arts,” said Nitin Mukul. “This exhibition brings together community artists in a public space, creating both intentional and accidental intersections as a metaphor for the strong, vibrant, eclectic community we are.”<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Arts Festival will kick-off with two art education workshops 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. followed by hourly musical performances starting at 12:00 p.m. as part of Make Music New York. This year’s Make Music New York artists were invited by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, one of the coalition groups that form the Friends of Diversity Plaza. The artists performing are Bethany Wild, CoCo Wade, Roopa Mahadevan, Nova Safra Bateria, AC Haley, Roberto Buscarsi, SA, and The Live Cultures (in order of appearance). This outdoor festival provides a space for local artists to engage residents and visitors in taking an active role to improve public spaces in the neighborhood. Local artists have been invited to submit proposal for art education workshops or exhibit their artwork as a way to highlight local talent.<br /><br />“This is one of many opportunities for neighborhood residents to get involved with the Friends of Diversity Plaza and participate in ongoing clean-up, greening and art activities to bring life and color to the pedestrian plaza,” said Ed Westley, festival co-organizer and member of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.<br /><br /><strong>ABOUT THE FRIENDS OF DIVERSITY PLAZA:</strong> The Friends of Diversity Plaza is a community partnership of local organizations and neighborhood residents committed to making the Jackson Heights Diversity Plaza a vibrant and welcoming community space. By helping to care for and program the Plaza, we envision it as a celebration of our neighborhood’s unity in its diversity – a gateway to Jackson Heights. This event was organized in partnership with Hibridos Collective, Nitin Mukul Projects and the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. Funding provided by Citizens Committee for New York City.<br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/friendsofdiversityplaza" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/friendsofdiversityplaza</a><br /><br /># # #

Music Workshop and Performance<br /><br /><br />The Jackson Heights Arts Festival is an all-day pubic event with free art workshops, music, outdoor exhibitions and beautification activities to celebrate the Diversity Plaza and the local art scene. The festival is an opportunity for the community to make art with local artists, make friends in the neighborhood, and make the plaza their art space.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Arts Festival will kick-off with beautification projects in the morning hours. Neighborhood volunteers will engage in clean-up, greening and painting activities to bring life and color to the pedestrian plaza. In the afternoon, over 30 local guest artists will exhibit artwork and provide free art, literary or musical workshops. “This outdoor festival provides a space for local artists to share their art practice and engage residents and visitors in taking an active role to improve the neighborhood,” said Carlos Martinez, co-founder of Hibridos Collective.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Diversity Plaza faced usage challenges in the early stages of implementation in September 2011. Some residents and merchants expressed concern and resistance to the idea of a pedestrian plaza because of the potential harm it could have on the economic and social vitality of the area. Hibridos Collective believes that the community can help change this perception and successfully implement arts and culture programming that will make this business corridor thrive.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />During the festival, Hibridos Collective will also launch the Queens DiverCity Map, a participatory mapmaking project partially funded through Citizens Committee for New York City.&nbsp; They will be leading a workshop to introduce community members to the visual language for the creation of an asset and resource map. “We decided to launch this project during the festival to show how the need for more public art spaces galvanized artists and community members to come together and create these art spaces ourselves,” said Beatriz Gil, co-founder of Hibridos Collective.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Both of these events are part of Making {Art} Spaces, a broader effort initiated by Hibridos Collective to create public art spaces through collaboration with other artists, neighbors, and local stakeholders.
