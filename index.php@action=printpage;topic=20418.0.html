				I’m considering buying a unit in this building.&nbsp; I’m impressed with what I see so far.&nbsp; Was wondering if anyone on this forum lives in the building and would share their experience/opinions on living there.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I&#039;m also curious about this building. I&#039;ve seen a lot of listings online there recently and it appears the building has some nice amenities (roof deck!) and is well maintained. It does always concern me when I see a lot of units for sale in one building. As per StreetEasy, there are currently 6 active units, 4 of which are in contract. As this is a 52 unit building, this is more than 10% of the units. There were also a few recent sales and 1 or 2 attempted sales that delisted in 2020. It makes me wonder if people are fleeing the building or if it is just a coincidence. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been inside and I don&#039;t think I know anyone that lives there. It&#039;s definitely not the prettiest block in Jackson Heights, but it is definitely the nicest building on that block (at least from the outside). It&#039;s also close to the subway, which is nice. <br /><br />Best of luck in your search!

				Overall it&#039;s a well-maintained non-historic district JH COOP that has excellent financials and reasonable maintenance fees.&nbsp; I also agree that it is the nicest building on the block.&nbsp; It&#039;s also just 3 blocks away from the closest subway station which is a huge plus if you&#039;re in a rush to go somewhere.&nbsp; Unlike some of the larger historic district COOPs, there is only one elevator and the units tend not to have that additional formal dinning room/gallery area (i.e.&nbsp; no proper junior 1 br units) so the average selling prices are slightly lower.&nbsp; As to the current number of sales, I think it&#039;s just chance, or the fact that some people de-listed in 2020 because of the pandemic and now people are playing catch up.&nbsp; I&#039;m not aware of any fundamental issues causing people to &quot;flee&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to answer specific questions you might have about the COOP if you send me a private message.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				<em>As this is a 52 unit building, this is more than 10% of the units. There were also a few recent sales and 1 or 2 attempted sales that delisted in 2020</em><br /><br />It seemed to like pent-up demand. There were no sales that happened in 2020 and 2019. While in 2018, five sales took place.&nbsp; About 2-6 sales happened in most years.<br /><br />The apartments in this building tend to be on the small side. No three-bedroom apartments, very few 2bedroom 2bath apartments.&nbsp; A lot of one-bedroom apartments.&nbsp; With smaller apartments,&nbsp; young couples tend to move out when they have babies. This probably can explain about high turnover rate than other buildings<br />
