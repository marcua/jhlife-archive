					The Queens Historical Society is offering a walking tour of <strong>Forest Hills</strong> this coming <strong>Sunday, November 8</strong>, in conjunction with its exhibition &quot;Six Outstanding Women of Queens.&quot; One of those women is Helen Keller, who lived in Forest Hills for 20 years! The site of her former residence is on the tour, along with all other Forest Hills highlights. <br /><br />If you&#039;re not familiar with this neighborhood, this is a great opportunity to get to know one of Queens&#039; nicest neighborhoods. And if you already know Forest Hills, here&#039;s a chance to gain insights into its history and culture.<br /><br />Go to <a href="http://walkingtourforesthills.eventbrite.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">walkingtourforesthills.eventbrite.com</a> to register for the tour, or call the Historical Society at (718) 939-0647, extension 17.<br /><br />Here are some more details:<br /><em>Forest Hills, one of NYC&#039;s most desirable residential neighborhoods, has a rich heritage. Its centerpiece is Forest Hills Gardens, an enclave of beautiful freestanding houses and village greens that was designed on the &quot;garden city&quot; model and has influenced urban planners to this day. Other sights on the tour include historically significant locales of Forest Hills, along with landmarked buildings, abundant Tudor and Art Deco architecture, and gathering spots that have remained popular for generations in the community. In addition, the tour will visit places associated with local ethnic populations as well as those with a connection to various celebrities who&#039;ve lived in Forest Hills -- including author/activist Helen Keller, one of the &quot;Six Outstanding Women of Queens&quot; celebrated in the Queens Historical Society&#039;s current exhibition.<br /></em><br />The tour will be led by Adrienne Onofri, longtime Queens resident, licensed sightseeing guide and the author of <em> Walking Queens: 30 Tours for Discovering the Diverse Communities, Historic Places, and Natural Treasures of New York City&#039;s Largest Borough</em>.

					I have lots of unused holiday cards -- the ones distributed by nonprofit organizations in anticipation of a donation. These cards are quite lovely, just as nice as those for sale in stores. The organization&#039;s name appears on the back, that&#039;s all (who&#039;s even paying attention?). There are cards that say Christmas, others with a more generic &quot;holidays&quot; greeting, even some religious. I&#039;ve got cards with snow scenes, Santa, festive homes, Currier &amp; Ives type images, cute animals &amp; other kiddie things, nature, messages of peace, etc. etc. Just let me know if you have preferences and how many you need. Will be glad to GIVE them to you! Just email me through the link at left.

					Has anyone checked out the brand-new condos at 85-10 Elmhurst Ave. (near Broadway)? I took a look, more out of curiosity than anything since I&#039;m pretty happy where I am in the neighborhood. These condos are priced from $341K to $680K! <br /><br />The $341K is for a 1BR on the first floor that I thought was pretty tiny. You enter the apt. in the kitchen -- where one lower cabinet is blocked by the refrigerator (which is against the adjacent wall; it juts out far enough so you wouldn&#039;t be able to open that cabinet). The LR is about 10x12. The only closet, and it&#039;s fairly small, is in the BR. The bathtub is both low and short -- perhaps an elementary school age child could fit in it lying down. The big attraction is a backyard, and sliding glass doors lead out to it from the LR and BR. Except the other apts. on the first floor also have access, which means you have <em>no</em> privacy and would have to keep drapes drawn on those nice sliding glass doors -- and you could wake up to people using your patio five ft away from where you&#039;re sleeping!<br /><br />The low bathtub seems to be in all the apts. I&#039;d say it&#039;s ~3 in. shorter than my tub, which I believe is average. Well, I suppose that would make it easier for an old person or someone with leg problems to step in for a shower, but it just looks so low and puny.<br /><br />These apts. do not have dishwashers, so people presumably would have a dish drainer on their kitchen counter. And there&#039;s not much other counter space. For a coffeemaker or toaster, maybe, but not decent countertop to prepare food.<br /><br />Apts. on the upper floors have balconies--which are finished with a faux marble type floor. I went skidding when I stepped out onto a balcony with snow on it. If they&#039;re so slippery when wet, wouldn&#039;t that include in the morning after dew? Also, some balconies have the heating/AC unit on it -- taking up a good amount of room (these are sitting-size balconies) and who knows what kind of noise they make.<br /><br />The only unit I saw that didnâ€™t seem cramped was a $580K 2BR/2BA on the fifth floor. Except one of the bedrooms is off of the kitchen.<br /><br />The $680K pricetag is for the only 3BR, also on the fifth floor. One of the bedrooms has a balcony and a bathroom -- that would be the master bedroom, right? I doubt it, since the room itself is so small I donâ€™t know what kind of bed would fit. Maybe a twin, or a crib. Except it doesnâ€™t seem like a very good room for a baby/child because with all the windows (incl. glass door onto balcony) itâ€™s cold and the room is so small no bed could be that far from the outside wall.<br /><br />So, overall, I was not impressed. Apparently, they&#039;ve sold 7 of the 20 or so units. The prices seem high for that location and the size of the apts. Would be curious what anyone else thoughtâ€¦<br />Open houses are going on every weekend.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
