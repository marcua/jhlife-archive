					I have a theory: It might be because your block is the first one that is southbound from Northern, beyond that closed 78th st area at Traverse park. Driving a truck (as is a car) west to east on 37th ave in the 70&#039;s is a total nightmare, with all that double parking from the shops there. So the trucks are sliding past that on Northern and crossing over to 37th or Roosevelt on 80th st.<br /><br />What kills me is how this city permits enormous 16 wheel semi trucks to make deliveries to say, that tiny Dunkin Donuts on 37th Ave. The whole shop can fit in that truck. We let these big corporations kill our neighborhood because their bottom line is more important than our quality of life.<br /><br />I am kinda sick of everyone scapegoating the open streets. This area is so lacking in public open spaces, it&#039;s ridiculous. 34th Ave being open is clearly filling a very important need in our community. And I say that as a car owner.

					When we were looking to buy an apartment we saw a very nice 2 bedroom apartment where the owner, whom I believe was an architect, put in cork flooring. If I remember it correctly he described it as the engineered floating variety that could be laid DIY-style without glue and thereby be easily removed.<br /><br />Probably not a super cheap solution but it was very attractive and warm underfoot, in addition to being sound absorbing. When I did further research I noticed it comes in lots of patterns and color options. Some is even made to look like wood.&nbsp; More general info here: <a href="https://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/All-Products/Flooring-Cork#lstBottomCont" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/All-Products/Flooring-Cork#lstBottomCont</a> <br /><br />It may even be possible to put down a thin rug pad first to protect your floors and provide more sound protection?&nbsp; I did research about duro design&#039;s cork options as there were several showrooms in Manhattan that had samples. <a href="https://www.duro-design.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.duro-design.com/</a>&nbsp; Good luck to you!

					Since it seems ok to discuss the parking permit idea in this thread..here goes:<br /><br />In certain areas&nbsp;in San Francisco people pay $152/year/permit to park their car in their neighborhood.&nbsp;4 permits are allowed per household. <br /><br />Short term permits can also be purchased in 2, 4, 6, &amp; 8 week increments..say if you have guests or have workers coming for a project etc. You can also buy single day permits for guests visiting for the day.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2020/12/rpp_online_app_1.1.21-6.30.21.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2020/12/rpp_online_app_1.1.21-6.30.21.pdf</a><br />&nbsp;<br />Imagine what we could do with $152/car/year just in JHs alone? And perhaps people that come from outlying areas to shop or dine in JH can buy the permit through the store or restaurant they are visiting. On this application it looks like it might cost $7 for the day. Might this encourage people to car pool in from LI to shop? Or maybe folks will come to shop and dine to maximize the $7 fee? Or maybe, just maybe people will use mass transit, especially when we are post-pandemic? <br /><br /><br /><br />

					Very interested to try this place out. According to Igram, it looks like they will reopen on Monday 1/4. <br /><br />For folks looking for labneh, I really like the tubs made by içim at Lemon Farm. I spread some out on a plate and serve with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of coarse salt and some Za’atar. They also have these amazing loaves of Turkish bread, that come in a few different configurations. I prefer the three round loaf version. Heavenly and would make a nice addition to the food you get at El Toum. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />

					I posted about these zones on this website back in September of this year in the discussion about 34th Ave closure. Since then, the plan has expanded and new streets have been added. <br /><br />Queens<br />Jackson Heights – Phase 1 (pdf)<br />74th St (37th Ave to 31st Ave)<br /><br />Jackson Heights – Phase 2 (pdf)<br />75th St (34th Ave to 37th Ave)<br />76th St (34th Ave to 37th Ave)<br />80th St (34th Ave to 37th Ave)<br />81st St (Roosevelt Ave to 34th Ave)<br /><br />More detail here <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml</a> <br /><br />Have a look at that list. Notice how Jackson Heights will have the most of these zones than anywhere else in the 5 boroughs? Obviously there&#039;s a long standing issue that needs to be addressed with this. Too many narrow side streets with double parked cars slowing traffic flows and creating so much honking. Like many have said, it has everything to do with increased package delivery. And that means it needs to be in residential areas, not just commercial. <br /><br />Maybe this should be in a new thread but why doesn&#039;t the DOT move to implement permitted parking zones in various neighborhoods in the city? I lived in Chicago and these were commonplace. I specifically lived near Wrigley field and this kept street parking for residents and pushed those from outlying areas to take mass transit or pony up cash to park in a lot on game days.

They told me there was a drop box just inside the door where you can deposit your completed absentee ballot.<br /><br />On a related note, I used a roller ball pen to fill out the ballot and the ink bled through to the other side. I suggest using a ball point pen to fill yours out...just to be safe. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />And on a last thing, if this two party system has got you down and you are voting for the Biden/Harris ticket and Jessica Ramos, I encourage you to vote for them on the working families party line. <br /><br />Personally, I found it very touching to see our community out there and strong, showing our commitment to democracy during this challenging time. Wishing everyone good luck voting!!

					So two things.<br /><br />temujin, This program you describe already exists here and elsewhere in the city, though only on one JH block so far (74th St from 37th Ave to 31st Ave) at different intervals. I did an earlier post about this in this thread, but here&#039;s the link to the neighborhood loading zones program. Why not add more of these? <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml</a><br /><br />Secondly, 34th Ave and JH is highlighted in this NYT story checking in about where we are as a city at the six month mark of the Covid pandemic.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-six-months.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-six-months.html</a>

					I hear a lot of discussion about how double parked cars need to be better managed across the board in Jackson Heights. Clearly this has been a long standing issue that predates 34th Ave being closed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recently I noticed a sign for a neighborhood loading zone. It was a large two or three car parking space on 74th St somewhere between 37th Ave and 31st Ave that was designated to ease double parking. More here: <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/motorist/nlz.shtml</a> This space was on a residential block nowhere near any businesses. I believe it was for a window of time like 6am to 6pm maybe? Why can we not have more of these throughout the neighborhood? <br /><br />And to the person who called open street campaigners &quot;selfish,&quot; I would counter that people who own and park their cars for free on these streets are the selfish ones. Why does a group of individual drivers feel entitled to the rights of that space, over an entire&nbsp;community benefiting from it being open?&nbsp;

					Just had lunch here. Shared a seafood salad, tea leaf salad and noodle with chicken and egg salad. All fresh, delicious and prepared while you wait with spiciness per your own specifications. Amazing variety of textures too. So happy to have this cafe in the neighborhood!

					I haven&#039;t yet eaten in one of these outdoor situations yet. I&#039;d be curious to hear about people&#039;s dining experiences on 37th Ave in particular. If Samudra is in arrears to their landlord, it might be hard to pay the startup costs involved in building a compliant dining structure for the street. I have heard many people say they just aren&#039;t ready yet, even for the outdoor dining experience.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And since there&#039;s been a lot of back and forth, I have a suggestion for this visual appeal idea: Samudra could place a translucent surface (like a sheer white curtain or vellum) inside their windows, projecting the image through this and out through the glass storefront. It would look cool, but considering how late it gets dark now, it might not be effective for many of their open hours.&nbsp;

					So we ordered dinner at Samudra last night. As always, so good!! In the past I was hooked on their channa bhatura. It is this super delicious, spicy chickpea dish served over this puffy fried bread. (I always add a side order of coconut chutney ($1) to take the heat down to my preferred taste.) <br /><br />Last night I wanted to try a few new dishes with rice, fearing the fried bread might be too heavy. We chose Aloo Palak, Channa Phishori, Spinach Masala Dosa. It was a lot of food for two people, but we wanted leftovers for lunch. <br /><br />The channa and the dosa were the stars of the show. The chickpeas had mild spice and were flavorful. I added a little of the enclosed yoghurt sauce which was a nice addition. I did enjoy the Aloo Palak too which for my tastes benefitted from adding a little of the enclosed (red) hot sauce and a touch of salt. (They also included some pickled hot mango on the side as well.)<br /><br />This dosa knocked my socks off. In this version the crepe was made with rice and lentil flour and filled with spinach and potato masala. It absolutely sings with a douse of coconut chutney (which comes on the side with it) and a dash of salt. Delicious and filling. <br /><br />Besides increasing our order frequency, we wonder if there is any other way we can help Samudra stay in business? Maybe a go fund me or other way to donate is out there? Please let us know. They are a true gem in this neighborhood! <br />
