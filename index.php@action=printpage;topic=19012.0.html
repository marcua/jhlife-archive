				Have you heard of chakras but don&#039;t really know what they are?&nbsp; Have you read about and worked on your chakras but haven&#039;t yet experienced much change?&nbsp; Are you ready to learn powerful techniques to clear your chakras of negative energy and emotional blockages?<br /><br />If so, join Patrick Paul Garlinger at 2nd Story Pilates+Yoga (81-10 37th Ave., 2nd Fl.) for a chakra cleansing workshop in which he&#039;ll show you some powerful techniques for clearing them and dispel a number of myths about how chakras and energy really work.&nbsp; Having experienced his own dramatic kundalini awakening, in which spiritual energy at the base of the spine is awakened and moves through the chakras, he can provide you with personal insights on how the chakras work and the benefits you can experience from doing your own spiritual chakra healing.&nbsp; In addition, Patrick is a trained energy healer and conscious channel who will provide an individual chakra cleansing for each participant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Due to the intensive nature of this work, space is limited to 10 participants.<br /><br />Saturday, June 22, 2019, 2:30-4:30 pm, $25

				Today!&nbsp; Join me from 2:30-4:30 at 2nd Story Pilates+Yoga (81-10 37th Ave.) if you&#039;re interested in understanding how the chakras relate to emotional patterns that you can&#039;t seem to overcome or move past in your life.&nbsp; We&#039;ll dive into what the chakras are, how to work with them, and I&#039;ll do a group forgiveness cleanse and individual chakra energy healing.&nbsp; In this workshop, you&#039;ll learn<br /><br />* Why the conventional approach of &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;balancing&quot; chakras is inaccurate.<br />* How to gently clear out stagnant energies in the chakras.<br />* How food, crystals, and color relate to the chakras.<br />* Why forgiveness is one of the most important tools to use. <br /><br />The exchange for this workshop is $25.&nbsp; <br />
