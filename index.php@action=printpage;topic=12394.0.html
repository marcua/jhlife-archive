				Just wanted to let everyone know about a new restaurant in the area called Casa del Chef. The owner/chef was the head catering chef for Blue Hill at Stone Barns. It&#039;s in a tiny space on 64th street just north of Roosevelt. The menu is small but very very good. I had the Portobello mushroom tart(really delicious) and the braised short ribs in a citrus horseradish sauce. My wife had the smoked trout&nbsp; and the scallops with spinach puree. We shared the berry soup for desert. Everything was very good. The owner expects to get a liquor license in 2 or 3 months. Until then, it&#039;s bring your own bottle. Lots of people on this board,always seem to be longing for a place like this. Granted, it&#039;s not on 37th avenue, but it is close by, and I hope people will support it.

				Casa Del Chef (Roosevelt and 64th Street) Dined here last night with two friends. Casa Del Chef is by far the most ambitious restaurant to open in the Woodside/Jackson Heights area in many years. Chef prepared a special tasting menu for the table that included two amuse bouches (an excellent mushroom soup capped with a cool parmesan foam); grilled shrimp and a scallop dish followed--both dishes fresh and flavorful; main course featured perfectly cooked baby lamb chops. To accommodate a vegetarian at the table, chef created a beautiful plate featuring portobello mushrooms and assorted veggies. The highlight of the meal was a humble Ecuadorian dessert that featured fresh peaches and pineapple fermented in a white wine and apple sauce. Memorable. Because this is a &quot;soft opening&quot;, the restaurant is still trying to gain solid footing....cooking is not as refined as it should be (a tendency toward over salting and underseasoning). While the service is gentle and kind, expect a long wait between courses. One hopes that Casa Del Chef will continue to improve and ultimately become the truly innovative, star worthy restaurant that the chef and his intrepid team envision.

				<strong>Finally, a new bistro in our area near Sripraphai!</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife and I went to Casa Del Chef Bistro Friday night and we had a great meal (39-06 64th Street).&nbsp; It&#039;s refreshing to have a &quot;new American&quot; type bistro in the ethic restaurant centric Woodside area.&nbsp; We live in Jackson Heights and have been long waiting for a restaurant like this in the area.&nbsp; Chef Alfonso is fantastic and has an impressive culinary pedigree, having worked at Bouley and at Blue Hill Stone Farms.<br /><br />The $35 tasting menu is one of the best values in the city.&nbsp; Take advantage of it before they start charging closer to what it&#039;s truly worth, which is significantly higher than the $35 fare.&nbsp; Also, no corkage fee if you bring your own, and they do have wine if you don&#039;t bring your own.<br /><br />There&#039;s a great Chowhound review http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/988399 (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/988399) on the place and I agree with the comments posted.&nbsp; &nbsp;I give the place 5 stars for the restaurant&#039;s ambition and because I hope more people try it out. The food is great, but needs some tweaking, and the service is friendly and aims to please, but needs some refinement.&nbsp; I suspect that food and service will truly earn their 5 stars shortly having been open only 3 weeks.<br />

				Went last night. Have to say that I was quite impressed with the Chef&#039;s tasting menu. A great value and we also were happy it was BYOB. We got there around 7pm and stayed till about 9:30pm. There was only one other group of diners, celebrating a birthday. The chef came out and greeted us during our meal, very nice man. <br />I really hope this place sticks around.

				In the threads about the town hall, and on this board, we have just witnessed a desire expressed by many in the community&nbsp; for a cute, homey, &quot;charming&quot;,<strong> local</strong>&nbsp; restaurant, serving, for want of a better word &quot;bistro-esque&quot; food. I finally went to casa del chef (64th st and roosevelt), and while technically in woodside, it was 10 mins walk away from most of JH and <strong> *excellent*</strong>. Here&#039;s what I wrote for yelp,<strong> please patronize this business for those of you that want more of this kind of stuff in our hood.</strong><br /><br />----<br /><br />This is a diamond in the rough! BYOB, michelin-star experienced chef, cute homey vibe, excellent hospitality, ecuadorean touches to pan-european bistro food. This is an *asset* to the neighborhood and should be patronized by all that appreciate good food cooked well in an inviting atmosphere. <br /><br />Woodside and Jackson Heights *needs* a place like this; when you think “where can I go where I can enjoy a bottle of (my) good wine in a nice atmosphere with excellent food” - this is your place.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Agreed. Nice one NYT. Hopefully this brings the clientle that Casa Del Chef Bistro is aiming for. So often it seems that the next thing you read after an ambitious restaurant opens here, is that is amazing- or it closed- in too short a time for a business to really find its groove.

				<br />My first experience was very positive, the setting couldn&#039;t be more humble, and the food is as impressive as others have said. I had the tasting menu, I will go back, want to try other dishes.<br />Less than 15 minute walk from JH if you live in the low 70s.

				Ate there last night with a JH neighbor and was very impressed! Only three tables full so check it out! The food is full of unusual and beautifully turned-out flavors. The staff is lovely and the decor very authentic to places I ate while in Ecuador. A lovely mix of fine dining and homey charm. Perfect for date night or a special evening celebrating a graduation. They have wine now, too so you can raise a glass.

				Sorry if I am late to the game, but I believe Casa del Chef in Woodside, is one of the best restaurants in Queens - it&#039;s a place you &quot;want to take your parents.&quot;&nbsp; The staff is warm and welcoming, and the food is warm and wonderful.&nbsp; Greens are mainly bought fresh and local, and it&#039;s menu is conscientious and seasonal.&nbsp; <br /><br />We went as a group of six last night after making a reservation earlier in the day.&nbsp; We were greeted with an amazingly warm apertif called a canelazo - so good.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t get to see the very talented chef - a&nbsp; Blue Hill alum - as he was in the back all night plating the beautiful dishes.&nbsp; The incorporation of local produce into dishes seasoned with the rich Ecuadorian flavors was fantastic.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is expensive (like Manhattan), but it&#039;s worth it. Nice to find a new date night spot.<br /><br />http://www.casadelchefny.com/<br />

				Last night we had the opportunity to dine at Casa Del Chef in Woodside right off Roosevelt Ave. The place is quaint and has an intimate and homey feel. For just $45 per person you can take advantage of the tasting menu where the chef will cook for you. You will receive 3 amazing courses plus dessert. The ingredients are locally sourced from the Jackson Heights Farmers Market which is pretty unique for this area. The complexity of the ingredients in each course creates an explosive dining experience and I highly recommend to check it out. Make sure you thank Chef Alfonzo for his beautiful creations. The end.

				As others have in the past, I feel compelled to revive this thread to say that I finally had dinner at Casa del Chef Bistro in Woodside, and it was so lovely! It was, sadly, not very crowded on a Friday night, so I thought it worth plugging this again- if you haven&#039;t been, truly worth it. We did the (reasonably priced) tasting menu, and everything was delicious, particularly the first course of ricotta gnocchi with greenmarket vegetables. Also had a perfectly seared white fish, and super flavorful steak (flat iron I think? would have to go back and check). <br /><br />quaint and cozy interior, attentive service, and most importantly, excellent food. <br />

				if you&#039;re vegan, i would not recommend going. you can put together a good vegetarian meal, though. at least one starter is meat--free on any given day, and there&#039;s always one (and usually only one) main that works - a pasta or risotto.

				I&#039;m veggie and had a great meal there! I think they&#039;re also open to accommodating special diets, because for their tasting menu they say &quot;Let us cook for you ~ three courses + dessert. Varies depending on the days&#039; harvest and chef&#039;s inspiration. Kindly inform us of any food allergy or restriction.&quot;

				Jeanette, if you&#039;re interested in the tasting menu and making a reservation, you might ask about a vegetarian only option in the notes? It&#039;s not an automated reservation system; it does seem that someone is going through and responding to each request (that was my experience). Here&#039;s the reservation link:<br />http://www.casadelchefny.com/Woodside_Woodside_Casa_del_Chef_party

				I can also add to the chorus above that they are very accommodating to vegetarians (I am one). There are always veggie apps and at least one veggie entree, and if you call about a tasting menu when you make a reservation, I believe they will do an all-veg tasting menu for you (as long as they get a heads up in advance, of course). They&#039;ve had some special vegetarian tasting menu dinner events, too, so it&#039;s definitely something they can do.<br /><br />A wonderful restaurant overall that I hope thrives for many years to come. Warm, excellent service and flavorful, creative food that is truly out of this world.

				&nbsp;Reviving this thread of Casa Del Chef Bistro in Woodside which I absolutely love. <br />&nbsp; We had dinner there last week and am still thinking about how great the experience was. Seafood crepes were tasty and then the steak and broccolini were cooked to perfection. They serve the wine from the Farmmarket Finger Lakes seller, can&#039;t remember the name, and it was a nice accompaniment. Altogether a lovely night out. Perfect for when you want a local meal in a quiet atmosphere that is really nicely prepared. Put it on your list of places to try soon.<br />&nbsp;And we walked home!!

				I agree that it&#039;s great food. But I must say, the last time we were there, I was a bit shocked at just how expensive it was. And that memory has kept me from going back, alas. I wish it was just a bit gentler on the wallet.

				I think it was the drinks that really broke the bank that night--it was more expensive than most places we dine at in Manhattan--just really a lot of money.

				We did one of the tasting specials. Yes indeed, more money than we usually spend for dinner, but everything was superb, and the chef took every food sensitivity/allergy into account. Portions were small (though as a smaller person, I prefer that anyway), but we were full by the end of the evening. It was a real treat-- as was walking home. I will definitely go back for a special occasion.

				&nbsp;Yes, it is a special occasion restaurant for a lot of our budgets. That said, we put the price in that category as it was cooked<br />to perfection and very fresh. That costs more and in the case of this celebration, was worth it. As for the portion sizes, I agree <br />with Maple, I like a smaller portion because I don&#039;t want to have to take a doggie bag home from an oversized portion or <br />feel bloated because I went overboard with a giant plate. It felt great to eat a more modest sized excellent meal and had<br />room for desert, which isn&#039;t often the case, which was also terrific. Alcohol is another story and that can be pricey in many<br />places. Am a lightweight there but recently heard a story from a 20something who said he likes a cocktail that costs $17.<br />and that is one of the cheaper ones in his not fancy local bar. That could add up quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;Anyway, Casa Del Chef is lovely and I hope that others will venture over to this restaurant for celebrations or just for hell of <br />it. It really is a local gem.
