				I think the Cavalier Restaurant has been here since Edward MacDougal conceived the idea of a garden community in Queens!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D&nbsp; All kidding aside, apart from the now gone Luigi&#039;s, Cavalier is probably the longest standing restaurant in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Both supermarkets, although operating under different names in the past, have been around as long as I can remember.&nbsp; Met was Shop Wise, and Trade Fair was called Big Deal.<br /><br />Pizza Boy on 74th is also a survivor.

				Sam &amp; Raj, the business that the rest of Little India grew up around, moved to Jackson Heights in 1976 (or 1973, depending on the source).<br /><br />So if 30 years is the dividing line between businesses that are old-timers and newcomers, then it&#039;s time to begin recognizing Little India as an integral, long-standing part of our community.<br /><br />

				Little India - The restaurant that is Arunee now was Maharajah in the mid 70&#039;s. Lovely, with a waterfall. I was introduced to Indian food in Manhattan, but to have a local eatery was/is heaven.<br /><br />Thirty or so seems to be the year. <br /><br />Also, the optomotrist (sp) btwn 81 &amp; 80 has been there for 50 years. Used to be called Dr. Steinberg&#039;s.

				Dingy yes, but useful as the only viable non chain pet store on that side of the hood.&nbsp; Though I do question 30 years of its presence. I&#039;m sure it has been around for at least 20. <br /><br />The chase bank might have a 30 year history here. Though it Was Manufacturers Hanover Trust before it was bought by Chase. <br /><br />The Earle / Eagle theatre in its various incarnations. The candy store right at the entrance to the Roosevelt Ave. station on 37th Road. <br /><br />The candy / newspaper store on 75th and 37th, though it&#039;s changed hands has always been there. <br /><br />What used to be Wise Stationery is still a stationery store on 37th Ave bet 81 &amp; 82. <br /><br />The Jackson Triplex<br /><br />7-11 on Northern comes close to 30 years I think. Maybe it&#039;s more like 25, it&#039;s been a while since I was in JHS and I don&#039;t feel like doing the math right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s that party / card store next to Numbers that may also come close to 30.<br /><br />There&#039;s the candy / newspaper store on 37th ave bet. 76 &amp; 77.

				How does the thirty year rule apply if the stores change owners?&nbsp; Change hands?&nbsp; Or change names with same owners?<br /><br />Like Gustosa Pizza (a hang out of my son now) has been a hang out to my friends and I since junior high, when it was Romeo&#039;s.&nbsp; But the same guy owns it.&nbsp; (Before that it was Alex&#039;s, probably not same owner.)&nbsp; Close to thirty years ... if you can count having two names.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Italian Farms changed hands recently but kept its name.&nbsp; That counts too yeah?<br /><br />After all, the strong survive but they also adapt ...

				Gotta disagree ... Coral may seem dingy, but every kid from my generation has done the loop on a lazy day (looping through the aquarium).<br /><br />I used to dread the walk in the cold there to get live shrimp for my frogs, newts, and salamanders.&nbsp; (Yes, I was a strange kid when it came to pets ...)&nbsp; I had one Coral-bought frog live from 3rd grade until college ... many evenings, walking to buy brien shrimp in soup containers, brrrr.<br /><br />But I vaguely recall a pet store on Northern as well, because I bought a white mouse there in high school.&nbsp; Anyone recall ... ?
