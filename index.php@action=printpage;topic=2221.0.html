				My sister and brother-in-law were looking for a one-family similar to what you&#039;re describing in the Jackson Heights area last year, and even the fixer-uppers were priced in the high 600&#039;s. (They ended up in Riverdale... good schools for the kids, closer to my brother-in-law&#039;s office.) But it&#039;s even more of a buyer&#039;s market now, especially if you&#039;ve got 20% for a down payment and a very good credit rating. Good luck and happy hunting!<br /><br />
