				We&#039;re looking at apartments in the complex of towers on 85th Street near 37th Ave., specifically the single building on the west side of the street at 35-50 85th.&nbsp; Does anyone have any info on this building--the good, the bad, or the ugly?&nbsp; We already live in JH and are only moving a short distance and looking for a two bedroom and a terrace.&nbsp; We have seen a couple of apartments in this building that we like.&nbsp;

				This is one of the 4 building complex called Roosevelt Terrace. I live there.<br /><br />This coop was opened in 1954 as a coop -not a conversion.<br />It is well managed and finacially sound. <br />A quiet, nice place to live.<br /><br />Good luck.

				We looked at a few units too. I found the apts to be very &quot;boxy&quot; and small (I&#039;ve always lived in massive apartments)&nbsp; Also to get into the apt you need to go through an outside hallway which I didn&#039;t like either. That being said, I also know a few people who live there&nbsp; and we&nbsp; lived over that way. I like that they are extremely clean, I believe most if not all the apts have a terrace. Also there is storage, garage, playground,sitting area an guard at night.
