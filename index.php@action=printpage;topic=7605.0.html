				I guess the word &quot;super&quot; is relative.<br /><br />I have lived in Jackson Heights since 1983 and have tried most of the places you mentioned.&nbsp; Of all of them, I would rate only Cannelle and Ayada as super.&nbsp; Quite a few of them are &quot;acceptable&quot; to me but super - no way!

				Having lived in Astoria for over 10 years and then being in Jackson Heights for about a year, I think what it might be lacking is a bit of diversity in the types of restaurants here.&nbsp; While many of the Indian, Asian, and Latin American restaurants are excellent, if I&#039;m not in the mood for that type of food I&#039;m a bit out of luck.&nbsp; What I would do for good Irish pub food.&nbsp; And everything closes pretty early.&nbsp; There&#039;s one Italian restaurant that&#039;s decent I know of on Northern, but are there others?&nbsp; Having said that, I&#039;ve learned to accept that I can&#039;t have everything here and visit Woodside, Sunnyside, Astoria, and LIC on a regular basis.&nbsp; One thing is for sure - the transportation is far better than Astoria and has led me to explore much more of what Queens has to offer.&nbsp; Which is awesome.&nbsp; Also, our greenmarket is amaaaaaazing.&nbsp;

				I, meaning me and my wife, totally agree with Madalyn.&nbsp; We both come from Astoria, and were a bit spoiled by the diversity of eats in that neighborhood.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has great food, but I would love to see a diversity in types of restaurants.&nbsp; And yes, how bout a great Irish pub like Sweet Afton, that families can go to during the day and get great eats, and people can go to and socialize at night over a pint?&nbsp; E77 is great and gets it, but lets face it....it feels a bit cramped.&nbsp; It should be two or three times the size, and then I would frequent it more.&nbsp; .Or how bout a trendy joint or two, with some new and exciting types of cuisine a la Ovelia or Bare Burger in Astoria?&nbsp; I think there is a market, no a need for these types of restaurants in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; They have em in Sunnyside, Woodside, LIC, Forest Hills, etc, and if I had money I would invest in something new and exciting here because I think it would make a killing.&nbsp;

				Walk a little bit west to 61st street area, Cuckoo&#039;s Nest for Irish-type. Also, Fresca la Crepe is right there too. <br /><br />Parts of Astoria probably has more diversity in terms of elitist to street dweller type dining, but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any place in the world that can match our cultural diversity. <br /><br />Madalyn, you have high standards!

				I get that rent is high. &nbsp;What perplexes me is how all these discount stores and chicken spots seem to pop up and flourish like rabbits even with rent being so high. &nbsp; I have no idea how the real estate market sustains itself. &nbsp;But I&#039;ve definitely just come to accept that this is the way things are, and have started to focus on what I do appreciate about Jackson Heights. &nbsp;Which is a lot. &nbsp;Quite a lot.&nbsp; And then I use our great transportation to take me to other areas when I want those things that are not here.

				Jeff, I&#039;ve heard good things about Fresca La Crepe, and have dined and listened to music at Cukoos Nest. &nbsp;What I am speaking specifically about is Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Madalyn, for a good bistro I would consider Uncle Peters in the 80s on Northern.<br /><br />&nbsp;I also find it hard to believe that rents would be higher in JH over, say, 30th ave in Astoria. &nbsp;Also, within Jax Heights the rent varies. &nbsp;For instance, the higher you go streetwise the lower the rent. &nbsp;Hence, Heads Ain&#039;t Ready moving to 81st street. &nbsp;What I think it boils down to is a restauranteur willing to take a risk. &nbsp;Someone at some point in Astoria said, &quot;Hey, maybe we don&#039;t need another greek joint. &nbsp;Maybe something different would work!&quot; &nbsp;JH is already a foodie destination, but I just think it could be more. &nbsp;What we don&#039;t need is another &quot;A La Brasa&quot; or Tandoori Chicken House. &nbsp;For that matter we don&#039;t need another eyeglass joint, hair salon, cell phone or dollar store. &nbsp;I know many of you agree. &nbsp;IMO it would be the joint that breaks through in a different direction that would be extremely successful. &nbsp;And as far as overhead, food does have a low profit margin, but liquor rakes in the profits. &nbsp;This neighborhood deserves a great neighborhood bar and hang! &nbsp;<br /><br />Daisy, you do have good points. &nbsp;Don&#039;t get me wrong, I support Jax Heights and want to see it grow. &nbsp;As far as disappointing store fronts and rent, there is this thrift store on 81st and 37th that for at least three years has had VHS tapes like Alf, the third season in its storefront. &nbsp;There is also a fabric store on 37th that has nothing but a couple rolls of fabric in its window. &nbsp;How these places make it I don&#039;t get it. &nbsp;<br /><br />When speaking of Non-ethnic businesses in Jax Heights, I feel there are only four businesses that &quot;get it.&quot; &nbsp;Those would be Espresso 77, Table Wine, The Lemon Farm and Inner Peace. &nbsp;They have well designed and inviting businesses (I wish E77 was bigger!!) with interesting and diverse products and a hip flair. &nbsp;JUST MADE 4 U sort of gets it by including crepes on their menu, but they need to diversify further. &nbsp;For instance, there is only one chicken crepe option, and its slathered in a cream sauce. &nbsp;If they really wanted to step it up they would also work on their breakfast options. &nbsp;Lety Bakery sorta gets it, but I have had some stale pastries there, as well as a red velvet that was more pink than red. &nbsp;They could take a note from Marthas in Forest Hills or Astoria to see how it is really done. &nbsp;BTW, has anyone noticed that there is nowhere to get a good muffin in the hood? &nbsp;Alas, I digress.<br /><br />In summary, the above mentioned businesses have only been around a few years at best. &nbsp;The neighborhood will change, eventually. &nbsp;Look, in 1995 astoria was not trendy, L.I.C and Williamsburg were sketchy, and Park Slope (in many ways our sister historic neighborhood in Bklyn) was just beginning to shine. &nbsp;Jackson Heights has so many great things to offer already, and I feel strongly that it will only get better. &nbsp;<br />

				Just a reminder to please vote with your dollars... meaning patronize only those businesses that respect our community.<br /><br />Kennedy&#039;s installed a sign and storefront without Landmarks permits..... so why would I shop in a business that flouts the law? &nbsp;I do not.<br /><br />Also, the old Mehfil by 76 Street is gone and the new proprietor installed a HUGE and illegal illuminated sign and new storefront. &nbsp;This location is not in the Historic District, but you still require permits to install storefronts and signs/awnings/canopies. &nbsp;Again, the landlord doesn&#039;t care, nor does the proprietor... but we should.<br /><br />So think twice before financially supporting businesses who crap-ify their buildings - regardless of where it is and what the business is.<br /><br />It is up to you.

				Interesting points Jhilfer.&nbsp; I was unaware of these laws.&nbsp; And yes, Kennedy Fried Chicken is associated with poorer neighborhoods.&nbsp; Even if this joint isn&#039;t related to those, it has a similar name and sells the same stuff.&nbsp; I was upset when I found out what that space was to become.&nbsp; Plus, with all the schools around that part of the hood, the owners are certainly hoping to capitalize on kids wanting fatty, cheap fast food options.&nbsp; Not the way to go, I feel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, Mehfil....great Navratan Curry.&nbsp; Sad to see it go.&nbsp; With that being said I was saddened to see yet another Tandoori restaurant going up in its place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I forgot to mention one other business that I feel &quot;Gets It.&quot;&nbsp; That would be &quot;La Gloria&quot; on Northern Boulevard and 86th Street.&nbsp; Best brunch in the hood with food that features an interesting play on traditional Cuban fare.&nbsp; During Brunch they usually have DJs spinning tunes.&nbsp; On the weekend you can also catch some live Cuban music.&nbsp; The inside design is also beautiful, with a bathroom to write home about.&nbsp;

				the overriding theme of this thread, and a couple dozen others over the years, is &quot;how come there are so many [fill in the type of business i do not care for]&quot; in jackson heights.:<br /><br />and the overriding answer is &quot;a lot of people disagree with you and want to buy chicken, phone cards and hoochie clothing.&quot; <br /><br />until you go door to door and watchtower your neighbors into thinking that they&#039;d be better served by eating arugula instead of junk food, and by wearing brushed cotton slacks instead of jeggings, you&#039;ll have to deal.<br /><br />yes, all neighborhoods change. but not all neighborhoods have to be exactly the same. you want an irish pub, be willing to walk a dozen blocks. ditto a bistro.<br /><br />there&#039;s a reason friends of mine say &#039;you are so lucky to have those tibetan, thai, colomsbian places right at your doorstep&#039;&nbsp; when they can get cheese plates and bison at their doorsteps.

				Yep.&nbsp; I&#039;ve definitely learned to just deal.&nbsp; Honestly, I got tired of being negative and just decided to focus on the positive.&nbsp; This area isn&#039;t going to change or it will take a long time.&nbsp; And I certainly don&#039;t have the time or money to help in the matter.&nbsp; It&#039;s a trade off but the good out weighs the bad at this current stage in my life.

				Wow I forgot to mention the hoochie clothing!<br /><br />Seriously though, It is true that unless some serious street level marketing research is done, there is no definitive answer on what type of stores should or shouldn&#039;t be in this neighborhood. &nbsp;Nor will there ever be. Though I think dssjh you already provided the answer. &nbsp;<br /><br />I used to live in Harlem, and most people didn&#039;t have a problem with all the hair salons, chinese food joints with bullet proof glass, and bodegas with one rotten head of lettuce, if that. &nbsp;However it has been ten years since I lived on that block, and now there is a coffee shop, upscale deli, and fancy restaurant there. &nbsp;Neighborhoods change, and Jackson Heights is more dynamic than most. <br /><br />Maybe this is an issue of gentrification. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think so. &nbsp;When my friend&#039;s parents grew up here it was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. &nbsp;The gentleman who inspected the apartment I live in (yes I am a homeowner here, so I am vested and do believe in this neighborhood) lived in Jax Heights when it was war barracks post WWII for returning veterans.<br /><br />There is no &quot;dealing.&quot; &nbsp;Thats a jaded and response. &nbsp;This is a dynamic neighborhood, with a lot to offer to many people. &nbsp;The fact that there are, as you say &quot;dozens&quot; of emails pertaining to this topic shows me that there is a large element to this fantastic neighborhood that is not being serviced. &nbsp;Theres your marketing research right there. &nbsp;As Daniel Dromm said, there is a bit of a baby boom going on in Jackson Heights now. &nbsp;Young families are moving in. &nbsp;If there needs aren&#039;t met, then there dollar unfortunately goes elsewhere. &nbsp;<br /><br />Some people see this. &nbsp;There has been real estate campaigns in both Williamsburg (&quot;Billyburg, Meet Jax Heights&quot;) and Park Slope (&quot;More Park, Less Slope&quot;) to try and attract people from those neighborhoods who might see a benefit to the value and beauty of Jackson Heights. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this neighborhood will ever fully lose its character for great ethnic food. &nbsp;For the forseeable future there will most likely be Indian, Columbian, Tibetan, Nepalese and Thai food here. &nbsp;Just like Astoria will always be great for greek food, and Harlem for soul food, even if the cuisine becomes more diversified. &nbsp;Jackson Heights will not lose, nor be hurt by further culinary diversity. &nbsp;These &quot;Dozens&quot; of strains prove that there is a market. &nbsp;<br /><br />Change, I feel, is inevitable here. &nbsp;Deal with that....

				I would consider opening up an awesome bar or americanized Nepali food shop, but opening a restaurant in NYC is a money pit. Too much hoops to jump through, fees, and the rents are generally too high. You find the coolest places in weird places, largely because the rents are cheaper there. 37th Ave is just wayyyyy too expensive. E77 probably has better rent because it&#039;s off the main corridor.

				In response to some comments I was reading, the rents are extremely high for certain spots especially on 37th avenue.&nbsp; Restaurants close very frequently because everything is going up in price from ingredients to meats, etc.&nbsp; I had a pizzeria in flushing and had to close down because my expenses were overlapping any profit I was making.&nbsp; My rent was not that high paying only 2700/mo compared to Thomas&#039;s on 37th which pays over 10,000/mo.&nbsp; I understand many people not wanting to take that kind of risk.<br />Some stores, not all, make it because they do &quot;illegal activities&quot; that make it profitable.&nbsp; There are places i know for a fact that traffic money and other things which is how they stay open.&nbsp; Unfortunately that&#039;s the world we live in.&nbsp; <br /><br />My favorite spot in the heights is definitely La Nueva bakery.&nbsp; If you never tried their empanadas, you have to go in and try them.&nbsp;

				10k a month for a place on 37th ave is ridiculous. I&#039;d rather have an empty storefront than people paying that much to the landlord.

In effect, one store is subsidizing another. One guy that I know of charged his relatives ridiculously low rents, not even sure they paid it -- it might have been just on paper, while non-relatives were charged premium prices. I think that would also translate into the building owner paying less tax on his/her low rental income. And filing a loss for the high rents once they&#039;re vacated. So it&#039;s a win win for the owners.<br /><br />Small business owners also sell their stores to &quot;relationships&quot; for $1, which is why they appear to be new stores when they are actually not new, but merely avoiding paying taxes on a profitable biz -- but I think the IRS was trying to tighten its rein on this tactic. <br /><br />Needless to say, there&#039;s some chicanery going on.

				Many of the restaurants here are fantastic, Coatzingo, Arunee, The Nepal restaurant on 37thave, Jackson Diner and the list goes on BRING ON THE CHICKEN restaurants!. Im sure not all restaurants appeal to everyone&#039;s taste. These places don&#039;t stir up your appetite or do you know of better places? There is a difference.<br /><br />More Diversity? Sure we have zero good places for a descent bowl of pasta, but as an Italian myself Im a bit of a tough critic. However there are very few good Italian restaurants in NYC anyway so if one should open here it better be good. Otherwise Ill make my own plate.<br /><br />This neighborhood deserves an applause for providing the most diverse variety of kitchens in one neighborhood. Sure we may be missing a few but no other neighborhood can compare.<br /><br />Buon appetite!

				choo choo:<br /><br />have you tried the pastas at louie&#039;s on baxter? not a fine-dining destination by any means, but i really like their pastas -- even more than their pizza.<br /><br />i used to really like the pasta at trieste, but something changed there about five years back, the istrian dishes disappeared and stuff went downhill. armando&#039;s, i like some of their dishes, especially the seafood, but the pasta is, at best, a &quot;C-plus.&quot;<br /><br />oddly, i got a good bolognese delivered by original rosa&#039;s a couple weeks back. had never tried anything aside from pizza from there before.

				For the best Italian Entrees I think I&#039;d go to Louies.&nbsp; Pasta is actually made fresh.&nbsp; Sure it doesn&#039;t have much for ambiance, but it makes up for it in price and quality.<br /><br />It&#039;s just funny, I had a friend over recently, who is considering moving here from Astoria.&nbsp; He was like, &quot;Sure, you got great eating options, but can you get a decent slice of pizza?&quot;&nbsp; I am happy to be able to answer &quot;yes!&quot;<br /><br />I also have out of JH friends who love going to Legends for BBQ.&nbsp;

				To jump in regarding the wish for a bareburger-type place-- F. Ottomanelli Burgers and Belgian Fries is in Woodside, but it&#039;s not a horrible walk in nice weather, and they deliver (and are on seamlessweb.com) to JH.

				abee - <br /><br />I&#039;m not 100% sure - I&#039;d suggest they do a search on their web-delivery mode of choice (seamless.com, grubhub.com, delivery.com) to see if F. Ottomanelli shows up as an option.&nbsp; A few Astoria (N train area!) have been showing up for us lately (77th St/34th Ave area), so anything&#039;s possible!

I have the utmost respect for the owners. They aim to please. They prepare mango and pineappple for me at no charge, using clean utensils and with clean hands (they have hot running water in the back, and use it). <br />It&#039;s not trendy and you won&#039;t find mesclun there, but they pick their fruit &amp; veggies well and don&#039;t overprice. It is a &quot;fruit store&quot; in that they don&#039;t sell meat, with the exception of enchiladas (but not made there in the store). They make juices and will be selling hot chocolate and homemade arroz con leche soon. <br />If you cook Mexican, you will find everything you want there. And if you&#039;re a vegetarian, you&#039;ll have what&#039;s important to you. Please keep an open mind and check them out.<br />Jeanette

				i think the better food is found on Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights; With several home-style Peruvian places including El Sol,&nbsp; traditional spanish food at Salamanca, very good Mexican @ El Coyote, Ofcourse Pio Pio, the best Pisco cocktails you can imagine @ Amaru( they serve good appetizers there) and a yummy new gourmet Pizzaria next to Amaru, name&nbsp; is Paggliacio(i think).<br />Enjoy&nbsp; &nbsp;;) :rockon:

				Amaru is a real gem. the kind of place that would have a velvet rope if it were on the lower east side. great drinks and vibe.<br /><br />el coyote, i just don&#039;t get. food is bland, sorta massapequa-mex, the feel is very strip mall, and the margaritas way too sugary.
