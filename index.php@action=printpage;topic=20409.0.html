				It&#039;s always wonderful to see creative new businesses opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I happened across Sweet Lucca, which specializes in rice pudding, at 83-06 37th Ave.&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re super friendly and were giving out free samples.&nbsp; &nbsp; They said they also plan to carry hot oatmeal.&nbsp; Check them out!<br /><br />https://www.instagram.com/sweet.lucca1/<br />

				So interesting that a place like this could survive on so few items. Remember the shop that sold bubble tea? I&#039;m all for it, but how can that be enough to sustain a storefront business I wonder? I love rice pudding, but currently I&#039;m dairy free--but maybe they do a non-dairy option.

				I tried it yesterday. Very cute decor and a friendly young woman at the counter. But $6.50 for a small container of OK but not exceptional rice pudding? I&#039;ve had better versions in Greek diners. Not sure how this works. I want to support new local ventures, but...

				I&#039;ve always been very pleased with the rice pudding at Food Town for $1.39.&nbsp;

				I think fillmorep nails it - an attractive space, very nice staff, but does seem pricey for what it is. Why don&#039;t they have a small size for $3 or 4? Also, they need to up their social media game. A lot of the Insta posts don&#039;t have captions or hashtags, and I don&#039;t even think they&#039;re on Twitter. Their website is bad too...looks like it was created off a template and has headings that don&#039;t even apply, like &quot;Get Quote.&quot;

				I noticed they now offer ice cream, classic flavors as well as boozy and vegan options. I&#039;m glad they&#039;re branching out, and JH could use some new ice cream options. Has anyone tried it?
