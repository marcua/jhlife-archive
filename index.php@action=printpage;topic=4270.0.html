				I used to live across from a great little guitar store in Manhattan, and would just run across the street and have any work and setups done there. Anyone know a good guitar tech here in JH or nearby? Who do local musicians go to? I just want to have a basic setup done, and don&#039;t really want to drag my guitar into Manhattan and back.

				I&#039;m not sure if this old thread will be useful or not:<br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1593.0<br /><br />but it may be worth a look.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else will have a better suggestion.

				Thanks - I&#039;ll look into the Astoria Music store. I was hoping to find something that I could get to by walking (or at least without transferring!)<br /><br />Astoria Music<br />3519 30th Avenue<br />Astoria, NY 11103<br />(718) 204-0400<br /><br />Although in the time it will take me to get there without a car, I could just as easily go back to my old guy in Manhattan.<br /><br />I won&#039;t bring my guitars to Sam Ash or Guitar Center. For those who don&#039;t really know, they&#039;re like the wall-mart of music stores...not what you want when you need knowledgeable and experienced staff. I&#039;d love to hear what other local musicians do?<br />

				Try Guitar Center on Northern Blvd. above the Old Navy and next to Chucky Cheese. There is a pleasant group of people<br />there and they seem supportive of every type of musician that walks in the door. We bought a new guitar there and they<br />offered to help anytime for free with tuning. I&#039;m not sure exactly what they repair but I think they could direct you to the<br />best local solution if they don&#039;t offer it. Would like to support these folks for their nice atmosphere in an unlikely location...

				I think you&#039;re gonna be stuck with another borough, then. There&#039;s a guy in Brooklyn that almost all the jazz guitarists use, there&#039;s a couple in Manhattan and a couple out on the Island that have been recommended.<br /><br />But, as you say, it&#039;s easier getting into Manhattan than most anywhere else from here...

				I would stop in at Rincon Music on Roosevelt, between 78th and 79th. They primarily speak spanish, but do speak english as well. I think its a great shop, and from the looks of it, they have a big clientele of musicians. If they did indeed have a recommendation for you, it would be a great find.
