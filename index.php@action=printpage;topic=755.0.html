				I am a member of ZipCar. &nbsp;They rent cars by the hour or by the day. &nbsp;The cars are left at a local parking lot and after you order it online, you just go pick it up and put it back when you are finished with it. &nbsp;I am posting this because the closest ZipCar lot to JH is at 47th street and Queens Blvd. &nbsp;I have written to them about putting some cars in JH but so far nothing has happened. &nbsp;It is a good service for someone without a car or if you occasionally need a large car for shopping or a delivery. &nbsp;Please look at their site and ask them to put some cars in JH. &nbsp;They have many different types of cars, from Minis, to BMWs and large Hondas and Fords. &nbsp;Gas is included too. &nbsp;(I have nothing to do with ZipCar other than I want some closer to where I live...on 35th and 74th. ) &nbsp;

				I am also a big fan of carsharing.&nbsp; Although not currently a member of Zipcar, I have written to them on several occasions asking them to locate some cars in JH.&nbsp; It is a natural fit for our neighborhood, where many people (like me) keep cars for only occasional use.&nbsp; Hopefully they&#039;ll figure this out soon.<br /><br />And funny... I just saw somebody in a ZipCar today outside Espresso 77!

				YES!!! My partner and I both have emailed ZipCar several times about putting cars in JH. They are starting to add more cars in the NYC area. They just expanded to the Bronx for instance. So let&#039;s hope they expand their Queens locations. It helps to tell them about 24 hour parking that is available in the area. I think the parking garage on 37th &amp; 82nd is 24 hour. If there are others, tell ZipCar!

				i&#039;ve been a zipcar member for a year now, and i think their concept is great. i don&#039;t really want to own a car, but having hourly rentals is ideal. if you have a business, it&#039;s only $9/hr during weekdays, otherwise, i think it&#039;s $11/hr otherwise, and includes insurance and gas. yes, they pay for gas.<br /><br />i&#039;ve already written to them suggesting the indoor parking garage on 82nd st and 37th ave as a new location. i think if they heard from more JH residents expressing interest, we may be able to get a car or two in there. right now, i have to go to sunnyside or court square to pick up a car. no obligation... just submit an inquiry from this link: http://www.zipcar.com/help/contact (http://www.zipcar.com/help/contact).

				I left them a note last night as well - I loved having zipcar nearby when I lived in Manhattan, and I&#039;d really like to have one out here - I only see myself using a car twice a month or so - so owning one would be more hassle than it&#039;s worth for us - but a nearby zipcar (one that doesn&#039;t take a half hour to get to) for local trips would be great.

				Just went to the zipcar site and searched on 11372 and it does show a JH location on 82nd.&nbsp; Is it still helpful for people to keep expressing interest in getting cars in JH - maybe in order to get more cars here?<br /><br />In any case, congrats to all the people who submitted requests over the past year or couple of years.&nbsp; Clearly zipcars does respond to such things.&nbsp; Now if only NYSC would respond to my requests for a neighborhood branch!

				It only shows up in your search results if the car is available. You can also uncheck the &quot;HIDE BOOKED CARS&quot; function at the bottom of the left search column to see all cars near you to see when they&#039;re free. <br /><br />For example, today, it&#039;s booked until 11 PM, but seems to be free all night long! It&#039;s a Toyota Scion - kindof ugly, in my opinon, but I&#039;ve rented these models from Zipcar before, and they drive OK and there&#039;s a lot of room for hauling stuff (and people) around. <br />(http://www.cars-show.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/scion-xb-500.jpg)

				We rented the Sentra and went to the beach this past weekend. It is so much more convenient to have the cars at the 82nd garage. Now that we do not have to hop on the 7 train to get a car, it truly feels like we co-own them, rather than rent them.<br /><br />I just hope everyone takse greater care of the cars in our neighborhood than they do at the other zipcar locations.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who made this happen!
