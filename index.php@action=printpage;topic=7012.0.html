				What is the proper way to conduct an apartment search? I&#039;ve been looking at online real estate listing websites (Trulia, Redfin.com) and have already seen a dozen apartments. Usually, the agent who listed the apartment wants to take my contact information, and sends me additional listings to consider. These are all &#039;fee sharing&#039; type listings, that multiple agents will also send me listings for. What is the ethical approach to this, and what is most effective as a potential buyer? Should I stay with only one agent, or should I continue to scour the online sites, which so far has been working fine, as far as I can tell. &quot;Go with an agent you like&quot; -- well they all seem very nice, ethical and highly professional. I could work with any of the agents I&#039;ve already met. I don&#039;t want to waste an agent&#039;s time, I want to be an ethical shopper, and I&#039;m also wondering if I miss out on any listings by not working directly with an agent.<br /><br />Just fishing for comments, I guess.

				As a former real estate broker from a state that practiced buyer&#039;s agency I felt so guilty coming up here and using multiple agents but thats simply how its done here.&nbsp; I think NY agency laws and MLS rules and regs needs an overhaul to make it both more consumer and agent friendly but thats probably not going to happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />It wastes their time but thats how it is set up here so you can&#039;t feel bad for it.&nbsp; The only way for you to be ethical as a buyer is when you find the apartment you want, go with the agent that introduced you.&nbsp; Different agents have access to different listings but it also crosses over a lot so make sure credit is given to the right agent.&nbsp; You will miss out by not working with agents since in NY they are allowed to have pocket listings. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a motivated, ready, willing and able buyer/tenant, as long as you&#039;re clear about what you want and aren&#039;t basically asking agents to take you sightseeing then how they spend their time is up to them.<br /><br />

				When we were looking we went online (craigslist, Trulia, etc). newspapers, word of mouth and did not sign with one realtor. Some of them showed us disgusting nasty run down dumps, Others didn&#039;t show up (no names but she is a troll on this site and has a major attitude) and others showed us exactly what we wanted. We ended up buying a perfect place (with just about everything we were looking for) and the agent split the fee with the listing agent. I felt that we are paying and have to get what we want when we want it and&nbsp; not worry about who gets commission. Sorry to sound offensive alot of brokers (except for a handful) in the area were downright terrible (this goes for both apt and homes).

				I am not sure how to answer the question, but I just wanted to mention that there is a benefit to going with an ethical LOCAL broker -- one who specializes in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; My own apartment search was very short, but I also looked with a friend whose search was much longer and involved several additional brokers. <br /><br />I did note that the broker I bought through was very knowledgeable about Jackson Heights and would not have taken any listing in a building that wasn&#039;t reputable or sound.&nbsp; The same did not seem true of other brokers who would take (or show) any listing in any coop at all.<br /><br />Although it is really up to your lawyer to review the coop&#039;s finances and let you know whether or not the building you are considering is a sound investment, it seems like a good first screening if you can find a broker who will not bother to show you listings in the less reputable/less financially sound buildings.

				When we were looking I would also look online, and if we saw something we would ask our broker what he thought.&nbsp; I felt that was the most honest way to approach looking, and it worked out for us...&nbsp;
