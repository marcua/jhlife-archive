				Dear Community Member:<br />As part of their community service mission, Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) continues to provide low fee and free psychological, psychosocial, and educational programs to benefit the community directly. Below are some of the services available this Fall (2018).&nbsp; Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.&nbsp; Thank you. <br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Skills Group for Boys (ages 7-8) with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) QCPC is offering a social skills group for 7-8 year old boys with ASD.&nbsp; Using evidenced-based techniques, children will be taught critical skills&nbsp; to improve social interactions.&nbsp; The group will also offer a parent training component so that parents can continue practicing these skills at home with the child.&nbsp; The groups are scheduled for Wednesdays 5:30pm-6:30pm for 12 sessions. The cost of group participation is $250.00 which includes the application, screening, child group sessions,&nbsp; parenting sessions and feedback session.&nbsp; (The fee is subsizdized by the college and may be further or completely reduced in the case of financial need. No one will be turned away for inability to pay.) If interested please call Queens College Psychological Center at (718) 570-0500.&nbsp; Interested participants will be administered a brief phone screen, followed by an in-person interview to ensure that the childâ€™s needs can be met by the group.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) for Adolescents (13-17) QCPC has an opening for two Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT) slots for adolescents ages 13- 17. TF-CBT is an evidence-based approach to treating and resolving symptoms that can occur after traumatic experiences. This treatment involves the child and caregiver in building coping and safety skills and in creating a narrative of the traumatic experience. This treatment is provided free of charge as a service to the community.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuropsychological Testing for Children: Again this year, we will have a very limited number of low fee slots for comprehensive Neuropsychological Testing of children. (Due to demand that far exceeds available openings, children with medical/neurological issues will be given priority). Please contact QCPC for information.<br /><br /><br />For more information please contact us at QCPC@qc.cuny.edu or&nbsp; 718-570-0500. Visit us at www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC&nbsp; &nbsp;QCPC is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-21 Main Street, Flushing, Queens.&nbsp; Mental health problems are treatable and QCPC&#039;s mission is to implement effective, compassionate, culturally responsive, and accessible (free and low fee) psychosocial treatment and educational programs to benefit the community directly.&nbsp; Treatment is provided by doctoral candidates in the Clinical Psychology at Queens College Doctoral Program who are closely supervised by experienced and licensed faculty. All services are confidential and available to the community regardless of ability to pay. <br /><br />
