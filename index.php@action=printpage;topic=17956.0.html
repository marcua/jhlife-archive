				John Pastore is great. we used him in our old house, and when i moved into the Warwick, found that he works on this building as well. consider this a rave review: reliable, great work, not cheap, but not super pricey as such things go.<br /><br />Phone: (718) 746-1161

				Putting my full weight behind a recommendation for Riviera Electric. Without going into detail in a public forum, they helped us with some pretty important stuff before we moved in that I think lesser electricians would have botched. Also 5 out of 5 Stars on Yelp doesn’t hurt.<br /><br />https://yelp.to/qTKq/XVHj59WC4N<br /><br />

				I used York Electrical Contractors out of Flushing recently for my renovation. They updated my kitchen electric, added outlets, and re-routed my electric stove wiring.&nbsp; They checked all my outlets in the house and fixed the reverse polarization (or something) on the outlets that needed it. <br /><br />My contractor thought their price was fair.&nbsp; Phone is 718-353-7227. <br />http://www.yorkelectrical.com/<br />
