				Donate your art and support our community<br />Art from the Epicenter<br />Artists friends, the outsized effect of COVID-19 on our community has negatively impacted the people, businesses, and institutions that have come to define this place as a global symbol for a pluralistic society.&nbsp; We all live here, in large part, for that reason. This project provides an opportunity for local artists to exchange their work for a monetary donation made to one of three organizations providing basic resources to sectors of the community most in need. <br /><br />Open call for local artists<br />Artists in Jackson Heights and neighboring areas are invited to donate their work to benefit more vulnerable members of our community. We are asking artists to set a minimum donation level that they would feel comfortable with for their art&#039;s sale. It can be from $25 to $100. All of this money goes straight to the charities selected below. We are trying to keep these prices low to keep the art accessible to buyers who might also be economically challenged at this time.<br /><br />Make a 2D piece of art using any media on a piece of paper or board (that can be mailed). The work can be up to 8&#039;&#039; x 10&#039;&#039; in size. The theme can relate to our present circumstances, but it doesn’t have to. After finishing, photograph the work, then email us the following at art.from.the.epicenter@gmail.com by June 1 or sooner:<br /><br />jpeg of your art work, at least 1500 px on one end<br />your name<br />title, media, size, date of work<br />minimum price of sale (from $25 to $100)<br />your IG handle if you’d like us to link to you<br />We will post it to a Art from the Epicenter Instagram page. Please follow us there.<br /><br />(*Though we aim to be as inclusive as possible, we reserve the right to not accept specific artworks.)<br /><br />If your work is purchased, we will send you the address of the buyer and request that you mail the work to them. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Deadline for submissions: June 1, 2020<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Fundraising<br />Buyers will be asked to make minimum contributions corresponding to the artist&#039;s set minimum price (from $25 to $100) to one of the following organizations.<br />Covid Care Neighbor Network. is a Mutual Aid group covering Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and Woodside. We are all volunteers–neighbors helping neighbors.<br />Make the Road New York builds the power of immigrant and working class communities to achieve dignity and justice. It has set up a COVID-19 Emergency Response fund to provide critical support to our communities.<br />Meals for Elmhurst hospital is purchasing meals from local restaurants to feed the staff of Elmhurst hospital.<br />Questions, comments? <br />email art.from.the.epicenter@gmail.com
