			&nbsp;Please support this little engine that could. JH has a lot of artists and once they are fully stocked this will be a valuable asset. Bought some terrific colored gel papers that we made a quasi stained glass project out of. They have a great assortment of card stock for original stationary and some high quality brushes that I have my eye on. Local shopping is a plus for the neighborhood and these owners are so <br />nice!
