				I agree!&nbsp; I would love a vegetarian restaurant in the hood (the Indian veg places are good but not very healthy).&nbsp; Or an awesome hippie food restaurant with healthy sandwiches, salads, soups, and entrees.

				I&#039;m pretty&nbsp; pleased with the vegetarian indian restaurants (my favorite is Maharaja).&nbsp; I eat at those vegetarian-friendly sandwich/soup/salad places for lunch everyday in Manhattan, and am bored of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they put in a specific vegetarian restaurant in JH, it would have to have something special that you can&#039;t find everyday, like &quot;meat&quot; dishes, but made with soy products.<br /><br />And YES--we do need a gym!&nbsp; I&#039;m sick of driving to Astoria, losing my parking space here and then having to also find parking there.

				Yeah, the challenge with Mexican places is the rice in the burritos etc. is usually cooked ina chicken stock and the beans often have pork in them. So a true veggie Mexican experience is going to be very hard to come by in JH. <br /><br />By the way , if any one finds Pumpkin flower tacos please let me know !!! : )

				Aronan,<br /><br />Obviously not Jackson Heights, but De Mole in Sunnyside (technically Woodside, but really part of Sunnyside) has squash blossom tacos.&nbsp; It&#039;s at 4502 48th Ave, just a few blocks south of the 46th St stop on the 7.&nbsp; This place is generally great, more veg-friendly than Coatzingo (although I prefer the latter!) and they finally started serving beer and sangria over the summer.

				There&#039;s a place upstate (Albany) with a delicious bbq tofu burrito.. we need something like that around here!&nbsp; As far as chains go (but definitely, definitely not authentic mexican food), I love Moe&#039;s Southwest Grill (one of the &quot;meats&quot; you can select for anything on the menu is tofu) and Chipotle.

				De Mole is great and so are the vegetarian tacos at Coatzingo (I&#039;m slightly addicted to them!).&nbsp; The vegetarian burritos that I have had in JH haven&#039;t been that great and I have trouble believing that they are truly vegetarian (though they very well could be).&nbsp; The JH food scene (&#039;specially Mexican and South American food) is an intimidating turf to venture into as a vegetarian.&nbsp; At least we have awesome Thai and Indian!<br />

				For local vegetarian fare, I love the Rajbohg cafe on 37th Ave., between 72 and 73 St. No animal products, besides the sweets, which contain milk, and the lassi of course. You can get a filling lunch for $5.&nbsp; 8)

The breads are all good, onion kulcha, paratha and naan. Also the raita, a yogurt dip is good.

				Maharaja is fabulous.&nbsp; We like the poori (big puffy bread) with the chana masala and spinach/potato dish.&nbsp; Their samosas are also really good.&nbsp; Have not tried their buffet yet...<br />My husband likes their various savory snacks (which they sell by weight) and we buy our sweets there when we have a holiday or special occasion that calls for giving away sweets.

				Another vegetarian option is Indian-Chinese, which is the variant of Chinese food that one is likely to find in India (and neighborhoods around the world with lots of Indian expats).&nbsp; <br /><br />TerraVeg (a new website for all things vegetarian) recommends the Jackson Heights Indian-Chinese restaurant Talk of the Town (http://blog.terraveg.com/8/uncategorized/chinese-indian-fusion-jackson-heights/), which has a good vegetarian selection.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also discussed Talk of the Town here on JH Life (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1164.0).

				I&#039;m vegan and I&#039;ve been living here for over 4 years.&nbsp; While I would love to see a veggie restaurant in JH, I&#039;ve even dreamed of opening one myself (a vegan Indian-Latin-Italian-German fusion experiment), but its not going to happen any time soon...I mean we&#039;ve only had a coffee shop with soy milk for a year.<br /><br />On the other hand you can eat vegetarian, even vegan, in JH every night for a month and not double up.&nbsp; Here are some of my favorites:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Mexican - Coatzingo - $2 Veggie tacos are the best meal in JH and are vegetarian, no chicken stock in rice, no lard in beans.&nbsp; This was confirmed in a long Spanish conversation with the cooks.&nbsp; Go vegan - &quot;sin queso, sin crema.&quot;</li><li>Thai - Rice Ave. (and Arunee) - Soy duck is amazing.&nbsp; My favorites are the Crispy Duck Salad (sub soy duck) and the Spicy Basil Noodles with soy duck (no egg, no fish sauce.&nbsp; Nearly everything on the menu is potentially vegan, just order with tofu or soy duck and say &quot;no fish sauce.&quot;</li><li>Sushi - Happy Kitchen - lots of veggie options - love the gyoza, warm noodles, the soups, the green river roll, the spicy tofu crunch roll...</li><li>Indian dining - Delhi Palace - amazing veggie food and plenty of vegan options, just ask what dishes don&#039;t contain ghee, cream, cheese, or butter.</li><li>Indian cheap dosas - Dosa Place - I was distraught when Dimple (my favorite hole in the wall) closed, but the owner reopened a couple doors down where Dosa Diner used to be.&nbsp; Their dosas are amazing, they have on that I swear tastes like buffalo wings.</li><li>Indian - Any other Indian place&nbsp; just ask what dishes don&#039;t contain ghee, cream, cheese, or butter.</li><li>Afghani - Afghan Kabab House #4 - great eggplant and okra.</li><li>Cheap Afghani - that place on the west side of 74th with the tandor in the window.</li><li>Latin - Novo has some amazing veggie items on their menu, the veggie fajitas are delicious.</li><li>Latin - Pio Pio has one of the best and most filling salads around (and I&#039;m more of a hearty fake-meat and pasta kind of vegetarian).</li><li>Cafe - espresso77 makes an ever improving soy cappuccino, soy cream cheese for bagels (not on menu, just ask), and has some nice veggie items on their revolving menu: hummus, roasted eggplant salad, grilled peanut butter and banana on whole wheat!</li><li>Chinese - Nanking Express - Chinese-Indian place with 1/2 of their menu devoted to vegetarian choices.&nbsp; Great soft Chinese style tofu.</li></ul><br />And these are just my favorites, there are many other Indian, Bengali, Pakistani, Peruvian...places that offer unique vegetarian dishes.
