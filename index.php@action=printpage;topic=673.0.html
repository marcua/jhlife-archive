				Just a reminder about today&#039;s music in Travers Park, starting at 4pm:<br /><br />Lucia Pulido Ensemble<br />Carnegie Hall presents a free neighborhood concert by this Colombian singer, who applies the traditional styles of her native country to more modern, experimental music. Her backup sextet includes clarinet, bass, guitar, voice and plenty of percussion, of course.<br /><br />plus 2008 Grammy nominee Hector Martignon (http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=14209) and his band, playing Latin Jazz.

				Coming this Sunday...<br /><br />Theater for the New City (http://www.theaterforthenewcity.net/street.htm)<br />2008 ANNUAL SUMMER STREET THEATER TOUR<br /><br />IT&#039;S THE ECONOMY, STUPID!<br />or<br />THE TURNING POINT<br /><br />(http://www.theaterforthenewcity.net/images/stt08.jpg)<br /><br />Sunday, August 24th - 2PM <br />Travers Park at 34th Avenue between 77th &amp; 78th Streets<br /><br />Theater for the New City&#039;s award-winning Street Theater Company opens its 32nd annual tour August 2 with &quot;It&#039;s the Economy Stupid! or The Turning Point,&quot;&nbsp; a rip-roaring musical which will tour City streets, parks and playgrounds throughout the five boroughs through September 14. The production, free to all New Yorkers, has book, lyrics and direction by Crystal Field and musical score composed by David Tice.&nbsp; The piece recounts the New Yorkization of the misfit angel Gabriel, who rides earthward on a bad dream to warn the inhabitants that the fate of their planet is in their hands.&nbsp; He must overcome the villainous Electric Man, messenger of the Dark Force, and save the world.<br /><br />ABOUT TNC STREET THEATER<br />TNC&#039;s award-winning Street Theater always contains an elaborate assemblage of trap doors, giant puppets, smoke machines, masks, original choreography and a huge (9&#039; x 12&#039;) running screen or &quot;cranky&quot; providing continuous movement behind the actors.&nbsp; The company of 27 actors, twelve crew members, two assistant directors and five live musicians shares the challenge of performing outside and holding a large, non-captive audience.&nbsp; The music varies in style from Bossa Nova to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan.&nbsp; Complex social issues are often presented through children&#039;s allegories, with children as the heroes, making these free productions a popular form of family entertainment.<br /><br />
