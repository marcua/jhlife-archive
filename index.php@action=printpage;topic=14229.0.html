				<br /><br />This past weekend, my neighbor was told a stray cat she feeds was hit by a car.&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t know what became of him but people did run to help.&nbsp; He hasn&#039;t come to her window to eat.....which he has always done for the past 8 years. Please if anyone knows....please contact me.&nbsp; This happened on 81st street, between 37th and 35th Ave.&nbsp; He looks just like this.&nbsp; Thank you ;(

				I see a cat just like this but it&#039;s always either on 77th or 79th street closer to 35th ave...Every time I walk my dogs I always see it running across the streets. This might be a different cat but same color/size...

				He would make his way around the court yards.&nbsp; It was most likely him.&nbsp; He got hit by a car.&nbsp; We still don&#039;t know if he was taken by someone or died and his body was removed ;(<br /><br /><br />The impact was hard ;(

				There&#039;s a ginger cat that lives in the Greystones courtyards along with a dark grey one.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen him or her in a few days.&nbsp; This makes me real sad&nbsp; :(

				Hes so cute.&nbsp; When I would approach him he would gallop like a deer with his back legs.&nbsp; The lady always has a week worth of food for him.&nbsp; She&#039;s been slowly throwing it away.&nbsp; When she told me I was so sad.&nbsp; When I got home I cried like a baby.&nbsp; She&#039;s been searching the courtyards at night crying.&nbsp; Broke my heart.&nbsp; She said hes dead but i told her to think positive.&nbsp; So many people ran to help him.&nbsp; Im hoping someone took him to a vet and hes recovering.

				While I was walking my dog earlier tonight I saw an orange tabby on 80th st between 35 &amp; 37 avenues. It was dark out so I didn&#039;t get a good look but it didn&#039;t seem like he was hurt or limping. Then again it could have been a totally different cat. Hope the cat that got hit is ok...poor thing.

				On the queens lost and found facebook page someone posted that an orange cat has been meowing loudly in that area. I couldn&#039;t find your original post on that site but please check it out. Finder also sent me a video. The cat was in the courtyard.

It&#039;s still out, saw it a few hours ago playing in the courtyard between 75th and 76th. One of our neighbors is trying to catch it to do a TNR. She made a post recently. I also saw it playing with a pretty black cat that I&#039;d never seen before.
