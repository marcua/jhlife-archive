			Morris twins - No mention of Budd&#039;s on 37th Avenue?&nbsp; Attracted kids from all over Queens. Summertime you&#039;d run into beach goers from Rockaway who came to Budd&#039;s after a day at the beach.&nbsp; Now that&#039;s a popular watering hole.

			I lived at 75th Street &amp; 35th Avenue from the mid 50&#039;s until 1972, a year after i got out of the service.<br /><br />Do you remember Molly&#039;s candy store at 75th Street &amp; 37th Avenue I worked there at 13 doing the Sunday papers.<br /><br />When I turned 16 I went to work for Bohack a few stores down.

			Yes, I remember a LOT. We lived here on 89th st from 1948-51 and my father was the local Doctor, office in Woodside, surgeon in Physicians Hospital and almost all the other (now gone) Queens hospitals. I went to Garden School for 5th grade and PS 89 for 6th (horrible teacher) and 7th (fabulous teacher, Mr. O&#039;Neill). He probably was the greatest influence that led me into teaching. I subsequently taught university, secondary and primary school Movement in the UK and this country.<br /><br />We all played punchball in the street near our homes, hung out in vacant lots (remember those?), walked the neighbors&#039; dogs and went to some Carnival each Spring down by Northern Blvd (ferris wheel and lots of rides). All were a dime each ride, if I recall correctly. <br /><br />I have just moved back and would love to meet other long-ago residents.<br />Yes: Fields&#039; dept store (small by today&#039;s standards but very posh to my immigrant family&#039;s mind). Jahn&#039;s was in Forest Hills, not here, in my day but everyone had their local corner candy store and ice cream counter. Near PS 89 was Hampton&#039;s, where they let us read the comic books for free providing we put them back nicely, while we had lunch at the counter.<br /><br />We had BMT (now N,R) and IND (now E/F) and it wasn&#039;t the 32 bus but it Was the 15 double-decker bus that went from Manhattan to JH. We took it home a lot from my dancing lessons. I became a dancer and graduated from HS Performing Arts in 1956!<br /><br />I have recently dissolved my animal rescue organization but am always interested in meeting like-minded people with animal concerns, or interests in the Healing Arts. I am a certified yoga, Pilates instructor and a Yoga Therapist. I hope to meet new friends here, now that I am finally (more or less) moved in.

			I lived at 34-41 77th Street from the late summer of 1950 until I left for the Army in &#039;65. I moved back, briefly, while I served. My first wife lived there with my mother while I was overseas.<br /><br />The park was just down the street and I played handball and used the playground equipment there and also the shallow pool with the spray when it was hot. I went to some of the live music events and rode through one of them with the guys from the Black Rebel M//C club, with whom I hung out when I took a year off from school at 15.<br /><br />I was watching TV one night in the &#039;70s and saw the surveilence film of a shooting on my block. The vehicle, driven by a Columbian drug dealer, came to rest against the back-stop of the ballfield. I called my mom and asked her why I had to learn that there were drug dealers living across the street from my old apartment building.<br /><br />Reading this site for the last several hours has brought back a lot of memories. I went to PS 69, JHS 145 and then Bryant where I was in the Honors Program. When it turned out that we still had 40 kids in class, not enough desks and not enough books, I got my shrink to get me out.<br /><br />I went to McBurney School, a boy&#039;s school run by the YMCA in Manhatten. I dropped out and ended up finishing at Rhodes School. I graduated, with honors, in &#039;63.<br /><br />I hung out at Moss Rexal Drugs on 37th Ave. where some of us attended Sunday Moss, having breakfast with the other kids playing hooky from church. Around noon, when Jahn&#039;s opened, we moved our base there.<br /><br />I was a regular at Bud&#039;s on 37th Ave. from before I could legally drink - NY was an 18 to drink state at that time. Since I was a regular, I could get in on weekends, even when there were lines. And, we could bring girls from the line in with us, making us popular.<br /><br />I have a lot of fond memories of The Heights. If anyone is interested, I will share them.
