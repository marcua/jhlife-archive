				I&#039;m just so curious: <br /><br />For over a year now I&#039;ve seen three guys standing on the northwest corner of Roosevelt and 79th. Rain or shine. Sometimes one of them gets coffee for the group from the bakery near by. Same three guys, every weekday morning. Not sure about weekends. Never seen them interact with other people, but they seem be watching the street and otherwise minding their own business.<br /><br />Anyone know what is their deal?

				Agreed, though I for one didn&#039;t mean to come off as complaining, rather just inquiring.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe they are on Google Earth that is too funny. Truly a landmark, those guys.<br /><br />Once I walked past them, after a few days of making hard eye contact (stare-down level eye contact) with one of them, and the next morning they saw me coming, lined up, and two of them whispered something like &quot;Boooooooooshhhhhhhhhh&quot; as I walked by. So, they are either soliciting something or they were adding wind sound effects to make me feel like I was walking faster than I was.<br /><br />Anyway, I only posted this question because I didn&#039;t know, like no idea. On its face I too would have *guessed* drugs or prostitution, both of which can be the front for other heinous organized crimes.<br /><br />I imagined/assumed/willfully misconstrued that NYPD patrols see these guys and know they exist. NYPD CompStat does not seem to distinguish prostitution from other crimes (from what I could tell) but there are very few sex related crimes reported in this area (but it&#039;s possible CompStat does not categorize prostitution as a sex related crime). Recall there was a very publicized push to &quot;clean up Roosevelt Avenue&quot; in 2016, and that kinda helped, I guess, at least on the surface.

				You need to contact the two NYPD officers mentioned above.&nbsp; Rather you MUST.<br /><br />EVERYRONE, repeat EVERYONE must email them and call with a complaint<br /><br />I first complained back in April 2018 to Officer Scala at a Queensboro Housing Association meeting.&nbsp; The JHBG board of directors has been attempting for months to schedule a meeting with the 115th Precinct s to discuss issues such as this.&nbsp; No luck thus far.<br /><br />If you do not complain, and REGULARLY, nothing seems to happen.&nbsp;

				If you walk down the North side of Roosevelt in the early evening (5-7), you will see groups of 2-3 men standing at 78th, and I believe 76th. When they catch someone&#039;s attention, they seem to make a gesture directing them down the street. There is definitely something shady going on in those few blocks.

				First, let&#039;s just admit this is the sort of profiling that cops aren&#039;t allowed to do anymore. Not because it wasn&#039;t a<br />useful tool, but because they misused it, it became racial profiling, and now their hands are tied.<br />But I also have to say....<br />When I first moved to the neighborhood there were cops that would be on foot (some even on horseback)<br />patrolling the area, eyes on the street, etc. etc.<br />Now there are just cops in cars (other that late-nights when a few try to control things on Roosevelt).<br />It makes a difference IMHO

				I think the salon Nishu down 76th is a brothel so that would<br />explain the guys hanging round on 76th. I innocently went there for a pedicure once and it seemed as if that was not on the menu. I don’t see much engagement on this issue from local politicians.

				I mean, you gotta figure our elected officials must know about this.&nbsp; They must see it as well.&nbsp; If they don’t they’re not paying attention (which would be disturbing in itself).&nbsp; &nbsp;So, the obvious question—are they doing anything about it or pondering a solution?&nbsp; Or do they just throw up their hands and say “This is bigger than us, there’s nothing that we can do.”&nbsp; You really gotta wonder.&nbsp;

				I emailed P.O. Liebold on this last week. 79th St&nbsp; falls under the sector he supervises. He replied to me while he was on vacation in California and we arranged to talk today while he was still away.<br /><br />He said the Vice squad has an open investigation with this group and has arrested at least one of them on prostitution related charges. Apparently these guys were steering people to a location on 79th where prostitution was happening. They also busted a man and a woman in one of the houses on 79th St and accused them of running prostitution from there. In between all that they have fined these guys for minor infractions like loitering.<br /><br />Bottom line is that they are on it. But it sounds a bit like whack-a-mole. He said the Vice folks continue to shoo them away and are continually trying to catch them actually breaking the law, which isn&#039;t easy as it sounds, I guess.<br /><br />Anyhow, it wasn&#039;t the most satisfying response but I was pretty impressed the guy actually took the time during his vac to reach out. He said they hold a monthly community meeting and he&#039;d text me with the info if people want to show up. It sounded like he could arrange to have one of the Vice people come and explain what they&#039;ve been doing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				When I first moved into the neighborhood, I figured the reason the apartments were so affordable to buy (yet nice)...compared to Brooklyn/Manhattan was because there was a red light district on Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />In the interim, apartments have become no longer so affordable...but the red light district remains.<br /><br />(Flushing seems to be similar according to that Post article.)

				Well, went by this morning and lol there was only one guy.<br /><br />I know, I know, the other two were probably just getting coffee or dealing with johns or cutting their heroin or calling Al Queda or worshiping the devil or whatever they do.<br /><br />Thanks to @am315 for actually taking action. Bravo. I just couldn&#039;t image the police don&#039;t know about this. Though I do agree that there has been almost zero foot patrol recently. However, I imagine/assume/willfully misconstrue that the NYPD has decided that--in this case--a uniformed police presence is not an effective way to discover or stop illicit activity. This is definitely a Vice Squad matter and not for patrol cops.<br /><br />That said, sometimes I do wish I lived in a totalitarian police state. But then I snap out of it, like, immediately.
