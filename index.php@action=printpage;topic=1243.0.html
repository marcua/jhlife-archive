				(http://picasaweb.google.com/willsweeney/Playstreet/photo#5221798770042019474)<br />Starting this Sunday, July 13th, 78th Street between Northern Blvd &amp; 34th Avenue will be a car free area for everyone to enjoy! Join us as we celebrate the beginning of a fun, new public space in our community. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Also, please help us spread the word to your friends and neighbors that there is NO PARKING on 78th Street between Northern Blvd and 34th Avenue from 6am-8pm on Sundays from July 13th through Nov 16th.</span><br /><br /><strong>Programming this Sunday</strong><br />10am-1pm &quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike Workshop&quot;.&nbsp; http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child.html (http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child.html)<br /><em>Free but pre-registration is encouraged so we know how many children to expect. Follow the above link to pre-register.</em><br /><br />---<br /><br /><strong>Why a play street?</strong><br /><br />The idea is simple: 78th Street, between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue, will be closed to motor vehicle traffic on Sundays to allow for games, free play, performances, markets, and other activities to take place in the car-free street.<br /><br />78th Street is right next to Travers Park, our small neighborhood park. With thousands of residents around it, Travers Park is very crowded on weekends, and often there is not enough space for everyone to enjoy the park. The Play Street will make it possible for park activities to spill into the street, allowing people to stroll, play, attend events and relax in the space, while reducing crowding in the park.<br /><br />The Play Street will also be a space for the Greenmarket that is currently located on 34th Avenue to expand, adding more vendors, and making it more comfortable for shoppers.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the highest densities of children per acre of green space and is the city district with the second-to-last amount of green space in the entire city. We need more park space, and the Play Street is a small practical step in our search to expand and improve neighborhood open space.
