				how often are people on the board who report seeing restaurants dumping oil down storm drains reporting these actions to the city (311)?<br /><br />The 74th street commercial area really does seem to my eye to have much heavier foot traffic than the 82nd street commercial area. You can tell when an area needs more resources devoted to it when you notice the garbage cans are overflowing (people are trying to properly dispose of their garbage, but because the garbage can isn&#039;t being emptied often enough it&#039;s overflowing and blowing around the neighborhood).<br /><br />I notice racism on the board when members of the community are referred to using not very subtle coded language that makes it clear the poster views them as subhuman. That hasn&#039;t happened ITT yet. Let&#039;s hope it stays that way.

				The dirtiest street really is 74th between 37th Ave. and Roosevelt, especially adjacent to the big fruit and vegetable stand. Something has to be done. I intend to take a bunch of pictures and send them to Councilman Dromm and start there. After that, I think contacting the Queens chief of the Dept of Sanitation is also necessary. The Sanitation Dept bears the responsibility of putting refuse cans on the corner and at the moment I don&#039;t see any.<br /><br />I walk on that street almost every morning at around 7:15am on the way to the train and I&#039;m amazed how much litter is on the street. It strikes me the shop keepers that are open just don&#039;t sweep up. I don&#039;t know why. But something has to be done.<br /><br /><br />

				Dromm has already managed to get paid cleaners out there (used to be DOE fund...now it&#039;s some other program I think) but even that is not enough.<br /><br />You can put garbage cans out there, but they would need to be emptied several times AT NIGHT. That area is 24/7 active. The reason there is so much trash on the streets in the morning is because there is no sanitation overnight.&nbsp; Also, people throw whole bags of garbage in street cans around here all the time. Look for big bags, boxes, etc in those cans. That is not street litter. It&#039;s illegal dumping, but they have to be caught in the act (same with the grease dumping, which I&#039;ve seen happen very late at night).

				&nbsp; I agree that 74th street is the dirtiest but 73rd between Roosevelt and 37th runs a close second. The restaurants do not <br />follow the rules for many things, as far as I can see.

				^^that will be news to the actual moderators.<br /><br />^I think it is. It&#039;s a bigger transit hub, with a commercial area on at least two streets there (as opposed to one at 82nd St.) with more restaurants compared to 82nd between Roosevelt &amp; 37th Ave., so it makes sense there would be more foot traffic.&nbsp; Commercial areas are always dirtier than residential areas, regardless of the ethnicity of the residents or business owners. Some areas get more sanitation services than others. I&#039;m not clear if that&#039;s solely a city resource issue and how the city chooses to allocate resources, or if BIDs and other organizations play a role in providing additional services. Perhaps someone with knowledge can provide some insight.

				as Captain Flannel noted, people of all ethnicities litter. and as anyone who&#039;s spent time in certain areas of Manhattan after midnight, plenty of non-South Asian white collar men in ties urinate on the street, against buildings, on cars and in their pants. <br /><br />litter is a problem, it&#039;s not a lot better on the commercial streets of the west village or tribeca (where i work). it is better in certain areas where the BID or commercial groups pay for extra services, delivered privately. i don&#039;t see that happening here, sadly.

				I agree that those new compacting trash cans are needed at 73rd and 74th at both 37th Ave and Broadway. Dromm who claims to know everything about trash does not want any trash bins on 37th Ave at 73 and 74th because he claims that people put their household trash just at those two streets. This can be resolved by restricting the opening to allow only small handheld trash. Instead of the boondoggle that is diversity Plaza the city would be better served by buying these high tech trash bins.

				The solar &quot;Big Belly&quot; trash cans are an attractive idea, but their implementation in Manhattan recently as part of a big rodent control program has been disappointing. They cost $3,000 for the can, and $4,000 extra for the service contract that includes an app that alerts whoever is responsible to empty the can when it is full. The can actually locks itself once full.<br /><br />In Manhattan, many of these Big Bellies have already broke down, been hit by cars, etc. The larger problem is that if they aren&#039;t emptied fast enough, people just dump the garbage around and on top of the cans. I have personally seen several of these cans rendered unusable by people stuffing pizza boxes or other trash into the slot.&nbsp; See some pics here:<br /><br />https://voicesofny.org/2017/12/bigbelly-garbage-cans-bring-new-trouble-to-chinatown/

				in Montreal, which is as diverse as NYC (and this neighborhood), most of the street trash cans are large, and partitioned into trash, paper, plastic and glass/aluminum. people just about always seem to abide by those rules and there&#039;s very little street litter. maybe it&#039;s just the air down here (and not just nyc; look at the side of any highway, or the streets of any large city).

				73rd Street is dirtier for a reason. One the businesses are open 24/7 while 74th closes around 8pm. Two there are more grocery stores that sell food and produce more garbage. Three there are more restaurants that have to throw out food that expired. Four, the most controversial idea is the the city doesn’t want to install metered parking on the entire street. Metered parking would allow the street sweepers to clean the street on both sides of the street 6 days a week. In fact what we have is just dirty streets that don’t get cleaned every morning. Then there are commercial businesses that don’t have metered parking in front of the buildings. The coops don’t want metered parking because they want the block to be residential again and want to fight every attempt to adapt to living in a commercially zoned area. Also many of these free parking spots are hogged by the commercial businesses with their own delivery trucks. 74th has metered parking the entire length and also has residential dwellings. So there is your answer.

				73rd is metered, except for a partial stretch in the middle of the block. How would metering the middle of the block solve the litter problem, which is mostly an issue on the sidewalks and not the road?&nbsp; The filth is mostly on the commercial stretches of the street because the coop apartments clean up at least 2X a day.

				The coops only clean near the curb. The street sweepers would clean 8 feet on both sides and would clean the entire block. The current situation requires that they turn early to avoid hitting cars and vans parked. Also metered parking has the additional benefit of reducing congestion during the day by moving cars and vans every hour. At night the garbage trucks spill the garbage onto the street. Since the law states you are only responsible for cleaning 18 inches from the curb, you are going to have a smelly food garbage street.

				Great insight NYC Per. I walked down 73rd Street this morning as usual and looked more closely. By far the dirtiest stretch is in front of the big corner produce store (called Apna?). It&#039;s the pavement that&#039;s closest to the sidewalk, which is clearly the responsibility of the store owner. When I pass by at 7:15 they appear to be open and are accepting deliveries so I don&#039;t quite get why they don&#039;t sweep up. But is it true that the sanitation dept doesn&#039;t run a sweeper there? Early in the morning there are no trucks parked in front on the 73rd Street side so the street is clear.<br />Other business owners don&#039;t sweep up either. And I noticed that there are no city garbage cans on any of the corners of that intersection. I intend to take pictures and send a letter to Dromm and the DSNY. There has to be enforcement and better action on the part of the DSNY. If you want to sign onto the letter PM me.

				Now that my memory has been jogged, I recall there used to be trash cans on 37th Ave and 73rd and 74th corners. They filled up quickly and people continued to pile garbage all around them.

				The trash cans were removed because people and business use them to throw away bags of garbage and they were filled to overflowing almost immediately after being emptied. The city has realized that removing those cans does not actually create more trash. It&#039;s not about terrorism. <br /><br />And 73rd Street is so much dirtier than 74th! I have lived on both streets. <br /><br />There are a lot more groceries and butchers on 73rd street and it&#039;s just a messier business than jewelry or electronic stores.

Are the brown people that live near 73rd and 74th more likely to engage in this behavior? That is just silly. The real reason we can’t have the trash cans on 37rh Ave is that Dromm has decided that he knows best and doesn’t let them be placed on those streets. This just makes people throw the garbage on the sidewalk. Also Dromm is behind the new perpetual Nazi traffic ticket crackdown at 73rd and 37th Ave. Maybe those resources would be better used giving out tickets to speeding drivers on Northern Blvd. where the small child was killed.&nbsp;

				^^I suspect you might have a very different opinion if you lived there and had to listen to the honking all day long these folks complain about. I&#039;ve been to community board meetings when people bring this up to the local precinct and ask for help. Seems like this might be a result of that, and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s ridiculous at all. Targeted enforcement can work to change people&#039;s behavior. It may not be a permanent solution, but I don&#039;t really see what the problem is with the local precinct allocating some resources to one particularly bad intersection from time to time to provide a correction.

				I just wanted to add a little more about the Big belly compactors. We do not want these things. I lived in an area that was selected for the pilot program. I quickly came to refer to these monstrosities as the Big Belly Boondoggle. Trash overflowed from them every single day, especially on the most congested blocks on our main business strip.<br /><br />I spoke to a DOS guy who was writing the field report on these for the city. He said they broke down a lot. He mentioned a serious reoccurring problem was jamming, siting the example of people throwing things like broken umbrellas etc. This required repairs in order for the thing to compress the trash. He said the capacity was only significantly better when it could compacted the trash inside. If it jammed it had roughly the same capacity as a &quot;dumb&quot; can. Plus that meant the city could not schedule fewer trash pick ups..which I believe he said was an idea to offset the start up cost.<br /><br />Another issue he identified was &quot;the push back on touching the handle&quot; which was required to throw something away. Just think for a second how disgusting that thing is. You&#039;d like to touch that? They even went so far as to retrofit a BB compactor with a step pedal opening. So after spending what..3K/can the city also needs to retrofit these just to get people to use them? <br /><br />My favorite saying came from a neighbor &quot;These things are an answer to a question nobody asked.&quot;&nbsp; So true. Sorry Alfster but this is not a nice thing for Jackson Heights...or anywhere really. I hope there&#039;s no campaign underway to get this scam into our area.

				Just wanted to add that many of the merchants are part of the problem.&nbsp; I’ve seen tree surronds filled with food scraps (big tray of rice) thrown out by one of the places on 74 street.&nbsp; I was briefly involved with out reach to several store owners who were oppositional regarding the up keep of the outside of their stores.&nbsp; I think this really makes a significant negative impact on why this area is often filthy....and it’s not just restricted to 73 and 74 street.

The NYPD won’t discuss deployment specifics, but it has some presence at all permitted parades. The sanitation department is more forthcoming: Last year, it sicced 42 workers on the Columbus Day Parade aftermath, who collected 23.5 tons of celebratory debris. It took them six to eight hours, at a cost to the city — to you — of about $13,000. Which, you might argue, is a small price to pay for a day without alternate-side parking rules.

				if you took that vote in our zip code, the majority would vote to abolish or radically reform ICE. <br /><br />about 40 percent of America feels the same way -- that&#039;s a higher percentage of approval than the so-called president gets.<br /><br />in other words, he&#039;s representing his district very well.
