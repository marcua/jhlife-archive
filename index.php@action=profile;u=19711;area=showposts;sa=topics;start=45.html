					Many of our clients often ask about home security systems, especially for windows facing the fire escape. I happen to know for a fact that Exit Realty has made a great effort to get discounted rates and free installation for our new and prospective clients by using the leverage of our 1700 offices in US and in Canada. I am curious to know if this is something that is needed in Jackson Heights and see if I can bring that deal Jackson Heights residents. <br /><br />Armen J.
