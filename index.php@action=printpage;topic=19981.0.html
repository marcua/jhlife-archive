				If it is a planned loot-out.. why would it be &quot;announced&quot;? Strange. <br /><br />Almost seems like there&#039;s actually an ulterior motive than just looting. Something doesn&#039;t seem right about targeted looting in the most diverse neighborhoods and it &quot;leaking&quot;. Sounds targeted and purposeful.

				I&#039;m not sure this passes the smell test. I can&#039;t imagine what would be taken-the restaurants are closed as are the banks. the super markets seem an unlikely choice. I suppose breaking store front glass is an option but to what end? The looting has been in high end shops in tony areas nothing like ours. To give advance notice seems improbable. If there is anything in this then I hope there is a police presence as I believe the community would be rightfully incensed that Jackson Heights of all possibile places in NYC would be chosen for exemplary punishment by self-appointed activitists who for some incomprehensible reason think a diverse and peaceful place like ours hides jack booted fascists who need to feel the weight of the &quot;people&#039;s anger.&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anything will happen but if it does I hope whoever is behind it gets the message that if you sow the wind you reap the whirlwind.

That’s a commercial shopping strip comprised of mostly mom-and-pop stores patronized primarily by low-income families. I agree that announcing a loot-out in advance sounds improbable, but social media chatter has been very active the past few days for both, people assisting those involved in peaceful protests, and warnings sent out to looters about police presence. It wouldn’t surprise me that platforms like Twitter would be used for “call-outs” to looters. Also, keep in mind that Espresso 77, while thankfully not looted, was vandalized. Hopefully, this turns out to be a false alarm.<br /><br />

				The wording of &quot;loot-out&quot; seems odd to me. The same wording was used on social media earlier in the week to lure a small group of people to attempt to loot Queens Center Mall earlier in the week.<br /><br />https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/group-tries-break-queens-center-mall-loot-out (https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/group-tries-break-queens-center-mall-loot-out)<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing the social media account used for QCM was created with the sole intent of stirring up trouble, and it unfortunately worked to some degree. People showed up, but the police were ready. It sounds like protesters showed up to discourage the looting as well.

				Yes, the Bronx around Fordham Rd is very much like Jackson Heights in composition of stores.<br /><br />I was there a few months ago, and the area did remind me of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Fordham Rd was looted.<br /><br />The other problem is that we can&#039;t have our cake and eat it too.&nbsp; We can&#039;t cry &quot;defund the police&quot; and then ask the police to help.<br /><br />We may have to learn how to protect ourselves. Should we all be on the street at that hour? There is safety in numbers and ordinary folks in a&nbsp; neighborhood need to show they won&#039;t put up with looting.<br /><br />The hypocrisy is that folks don&#039;t seem to care that other neighborhoods are being looted. But when it&#039;s us...people are up in arms.<br /><br />There is an element of self-interest and selfishness in that. It needs to be called out. The other areas that were looted are also neighborhoods with ordinary people. Just like ours.<br /><br />As always...two wrongs don&#039;t make a right. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				watch this:<br /><br />if the cops know there is a loot out, but the cops are not on the scene, or on the scene in numbers to effectively stop any sort of looting in its tracks...then the cops don&#039;t care if the neighborhood is being looted.<br /><br />what they care about is seeing minorities and &#039;liberals&#039; pitted against black people and the cause.<br /><br />so be there, and have your cameras out without bias. see who the real looters are.<br /><br />also this:<br /><br />who begins looting a commercial street before stores close down. before nightfall? that&#039;s beginning with quite a handicap.<br /><br />finally:<br /><br />people are arguing that looting is wrong and want it denounced in all neighborhoods.<br /><br />killing black people is wrong. denounce that, end that and I promise you the looting will end. how many small businesses in this neighborhood got any sort of insurance during covid, compared to corporations. you want to argue about looting consider it out of the frame of standard definition. <br /><br />PS<br /><br />defunding police doesn&#039;t mean relying on vigilantes keeping the peace. but when crime is down but police budget goes up, up, up...don&#039;t you think your kids deserve some of that cash being put into their education? weren&#039;t you all up in arms that elmhurst wasn&#039;t getting the funding it needed? <br /><br />

				There are many store fronts boarded up from 74th St to 82nd. There are a group of young men in front of Food Dynasty who have signs saying Looters Go Home.

				I don&#039; live in JH (but still from Queens), but I shop here all the time. Please keep everyone posted and bless the people who are out there protecting the neighborhood. It has come down to this - us having to fend for ourselves. Whether this is a hoax or not, still better safe than sorry. On FB, there&#039;s a post about rocks being planted at various points on Queens Blvd as &#039;marks&#039; for looters.

				Disinformation is a standard tactic to cause diversions. Looters do not generally let their plans be known, and the amount of publicity this got in the media may have convinced anyone actually planning to loot the neighborhood to change their plans. Or simple terror may have been the real agenda. You don&#039;t have to actually injure anyone to terrorize them.
