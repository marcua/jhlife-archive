					Hi Jackson Heights-<br /><br />A few weeks ago I launched a Social Justice Online Magazine, JustNoMore.com .&nbsp; I am fortunate to be working with local photographer, Bruce Armstrong, whose work focuses on Jackson Heights, Flushing, and the 7 Train, so many of the photographs will be familiar to neighborhood residents.&nbsp; The topics are national/international, but I spent 25 years working with immigrant communities here in JH, so there is a heavy focus on immigration.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have put a lot of heart into this project, and I hope that you enjoy both the neighborhood photos and the content.&nbsp; Please take a look at the site. Click around!&nbsp; If you find the content valuable, share it!&nbsp; If you are just there for the pics of Jackson Heights, scroll down past the slider, and you will see the 12 most recent articles.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks,<br />KC<br /><br />

					My neighbor on the garden committee has been caring for this garden for more than 40 years, and she says she has never seen anything like this.&nbsp; She said the dying squirrel was foaming.&nbsp; She called all over the city, and seems to think that the insecticide was to kill Japanese beetles or some such thing.&nbsp;

					Members of our garden committe have found three dead squirrels and one dying squirrel in our garden over the past several days.&nbsp; A couple of weeks back, we had those yellow signs up warning that they had put out some sort of poisons, I assume to kill pests that might effect our trees.&nbsp; I love our trees, but I am extremely concerned that this poison might be what killed the squirrels, and that it could pose a threat to other animals, or more importantly, to our children.<br /><br />Has anyone else seen anything unusual in your gardens?

					I have a bunch of questions.<br /><br />First of all, <strong>is it possible to get an injunction against the sale, pending an investigation of potential impropriety</strong>? <br /><br />Secondly, <strong>if the sale takes place, is it then possible for the city to invoke eminent domain and take over the land from the potential developers</strong>?<br /><br />Finally, <strong>is there anyone who can help the Garden School get a better deal on this ridiculous loan</strong>? &nbsp;People get better mortgages or transfer their credit card debt to a card with a better rate all the time. &nbsp;Given that there are clearly a bunch of offers on the table for this land, there must be some legitimate creditor willing to give them a loan at market rates.<br /><br />

					I hope that Danny&#039;s office investigates the Board Meeting Minutes that should document what lead up to this absurd decision. &nbsp;<br /><br />I also think that the personal finances of the board members should be investigated, because i can&#039;t believe that a loan like that was taken without kickbacks. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Board members are people with money that they are used to managing. And their personal investments were having a bad year because nothing was paying interest or dividends. &nbsp; I cannot believe that they would have made a decision like this on behalf of the school, unless there was some personal benefit, which would constitute criminal activity. &nbsp;

					Iâ€™m racking my brain to try and figure out what the problem is at this point.&nbsp; Why would the Garden School continue to want to sell to developers, after being offered both an exceptional offer from the City, coupled with generous community donations to tide them through until the City money comes?<br /><br />There has to be some reason, but I canâ€™t figure it out.&nbsp; Here are some absurd ideas, none of which I really believe.&nbsp; But I canâ€™t come up with anything better.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Sears (Garden School Board member and former City Council Rep) is so mad that she lost office after putting all of that money into Travers Park, and didnâ€™t get the park named after her, that she is not going to let the man who she lost the election to (Danny Dromm) lead a movement to improve park space in the community.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden School has already decided it is about to fold, and is just looking to bring in some quick cash now to carry it through until the Race for the Top money starts flowing.&nbsp; (Race for the Top money will bring 64 new charter schools to NYC in 2012, 32 new charter schools in 2013, and 32 more in 2014.)&nbsp; &nbsp;They figure they have a fabulous facility that one of those charter schools will buy out.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s financial mismanagement is so severe that they really desperately need the full $6 million to make it through the end of the school year.&nbsp; In this case, they are certainly not sustainable.&nbsp; See Absurd Theory #2.<br /><br />Absurd Theory #4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schoolâ€™s leadership is full of teaparty fanatics, who consider City-owned parks to be beacons of excessively large/invasive government, and would prefer the land to be in the hands of the private sector.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can anyone offer a somewhat less absurd theory?&nbsp; <br /><br />

					With all due respect to the staff and board at the Garden School, as well as the students and the parents, I have to agree with Dudley. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School has a lot going for it. &nbsp;It is part of our communityâ€™s history. &nbsp;It has a great after school program in the arts and music. &nbsp;By all accounts, students and parents do feel like an extended family.<br /><br />But over the years, the Garden School has made the decision to, on many levels, set itself apart from the larger community. &nbsp;More recent educational institutions, such as the Renaissance School and 82nd Street Academics have integrated themselves into the fabric of the community through linkages and partnerships and activities that reflect a concern not only for their students and their families, but also for the larger community. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Garden School, it seems, has not even looked at the changing demographics of the neighborhood in recent years, and recognized that the influx of more middle class and upper middle class families with young children should be bringing them lots of business.&nbsp; Instead, they prefer to reach out to Manhattan families and families from more affluent Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods, who find them more economical than Manhattan private schools. &nbsp;<br /><br />When my daughter was 2, I took a tour of their preschool, and seriously considered it as an option for the following year. &nbsp;The program looked great. &nbsp;But I was baffled by the fact that they did not run a UPK program for 4 year olds. &nbsp;Why would I pay for something that should be free for all NY kids? &nbsp;Many active, involved parents who plan carefully for their childrenâ€™s education start looking at quality UPK programs at least a year or two in advance. &nbsp;I wanted to send my 3 year old to the school where she would attend UPK (plus extended day, paid for out of pocked) as a 4 year old. &nbsp;Why would the Garden School decide to exclude that huge pool of parents? &nbsp;It seems to me that a quality UPK program would not only bring money into the school for the kids attending UPK, but would also bring families into the school, a percentage of whom would undoubtedly decide to keep their kids there for kindergarten, and perhaps even through high school!<br /><br />In a neighborhood in which all of the other schools are bursting at the seems, why is the Garden School having low enrollment and financial problems? &nbsp;I believe that for many many years, they have dismissed the surrounding Jackson Heights community. &nbsp;And I believe that their recent actions demonstrate that they intend to continue to dismiss the community. &nbsp;<br /><br />Actually, it is worse than that. &nbsp;They have alienated the community that should be filling their classrooms. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As I research kindergartens for my daughter to attend next September, most of my first choices are schools with crazy competitive lotteries. &nbsp;Renaissance accepted 40 students out of 1400 applications last year. &nbsp;We will apply. &nbsp;We probably wonâ€™t get in. &nbsp; <br /><br />Up until a few weeks ago, the Garden School was my backup. &nbsp;My â€œsafety school.â€ &nbsp;If my daughter did not get into any of the other schools that we are applying to, I could figure out a way to pay the tuition at the Garden School. &nbsp;<br /><br />At this point, I am so mad at the Garden School, that I no longer consider them an option. &nbsp;And Iâ€™ve spoken with quite a few parents of Sept 2011 kindergarteners who feel the same way. &nbsp;<br /><br />As Dudley said, their behavior is â€œbizarre and inexplicable.â€ &nbsp;Unless they plan to sell out once the Race to the Top money, (which will create 64 new charter schools in 2012) starts flowing. &nbsp;<br />

					RCN is available in some buildings, but not all.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had them for a few years, and I&#039;m satisfied.&nbsp; Not thrilled, but satisfied.&nbsp; Much happier than I was with Time Warner, and the customer service is far superior.&nbsp; The &quot;on demand&quot; menu is bulky and the categories are not well thought out.&nbsp; Other than that, they are fine.&nbsp; When FIOS gets here, I will probably switch to them.&nbsp;

					Sorry to come to this thread late.&nbsp; <br /><br />In response to Foxy&#039;s question, I did.&nbsp; Lot&#039;s of cute holiday stuff at <strong>Frank&#039;s Pharmacy</strong>.&nbsp; I always find surprising stocking stuffers at the <strong>amazing stationary store </strong> two doors down from Jahn&#039;s.&nbsp; Got my wreath at <strong>Ultima</strong> Florals. I LOVE Ultima.&nbsp; Never waste your money on 800 flowers.&nbsp; Got wrapping paper and gift bags at the 99 cent store.&nbsp; <br /><br />Really wanted to get hat/mittens for my 4 year old at Inner Peace, but they never had her size.&nbsp; Beautiful painted gourds are on my tree from last year&#039;s purchase at Rudy Volcano.&nbsp; <br /><br />In previous years I got DVD players and things like that at the appliance/electronic store on 37th and the mid 80&#039;s.&nbsp; Forget the name J&amp;R?&nbsp; J&amp;A?&nbsp; Something like that.&nbsp; They also sell, deliver and install high quality air conditioners much cheaper than PC Richards, and have exceptional customer service.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had a conversation recently with a friend who surprised me me when she said that there was nothing interesting to buy on our commercial strip.&nbsp; I really disagree.&nbsp; I usually say that I can find almost anything here, other than clothes or books.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also went to some chains.&nbsp; EB Games and the Children&#039;s Place.&nbsp; But I prefer to spend my money in the family run businesses when I can.&nbsp;

					Obesity concerns?&nbsp; Then you buy a bunch of sheets with stickers and cut them up and give them out.&nbsp; The campaign office was bustling with young people sitting at computers and talking on telephones.&nbsp; It is not like he didn&#039;t have the staff available.<br /><br />But I would like to praise all of the local businesses that really made the day special for the kids.&nbsp; It has been another tough year financially, but most of the mom and pop shops not only bought something to give out, but also dedicated a staff member to stand around with a pail or a basket, greeting the kids and giving stuff out for hours.&nbsp; The bodegas, the nail salons, the restaurants, the 99 cent stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;Immigrants, from every corner of planet earth, who have no celebrations like this in their countries of origin, have easily adopted this community tradition.&nbsp; My daughter enjoyed the generosity of people whose households speak dozens of different languages.&nbsp; <br /><br />This morning she woke up and said &quot;Mommy, can we go and say thank you to all the people who gave us treats yesterday?&quot;&nbsp; And I think it is a wonderful idea.&nbsp;

					I am not suggesting that anyone change their vote based on this incident, and that was certainly no the intention of my post.&nbsp; It was a pure vent.&nbsp; <br /><br />For quite a while I have been resigned to the fact that I will vote for Moya, or I won&#039;t vote.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had decided to just vote for Moya.&nbsp; &nbsp;And sadly, I probably still will.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This incident will just make my vote sting a little more.&nbsp;

					Walking back up 37th Ave with my 4 year old after today&#039;s beautiful halloween parade, we stopped and trick or treated in dozens of local businesses.&nbsp; And guess who had NOTHING for trick or treaters?<br /><br />Moya&#039;s campaign office. <br /><br />He should be ashamed.<br /><br />All the literature on him talks about him as a &quot;lifelong resident of the district&quot; and as someone who is integrated into the life of the community.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never met the guy, and I&#039;ve been active in the community for 20 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did he not know the the city&#039;s second largest halloween parade was passing by his office, 3 days before his election?&nbsp; Did he not know that in this neighborhood, kids trick or treat at storefronts along the parade route?&nbsp; Or did he not care?<br /><br />Was he so busy giving out goodie bags at the end of the parade that he neglected to have treats in his campaign office?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see him.&nbsp; He might have been there.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure I would know him if I saw him.&nbsp; My daughter got her goodie bag from Danny Dromm, who is omnipresent, and has been for many many years.&nbsp; <br /><br />Will Moya be better than Monseratte?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; But I am really disgusted with the options that we have been given in this election.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Thank you for letting me rant.&nbsp;
