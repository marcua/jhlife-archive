				Yesterday morning I was waiting outside Caffe Bene for my co-worker when I saw a truck pull up in front of La Boina Roja Steakhouse. The driver got out, went around to the other side of his truck, and when he opened the door, three pieces of meat fell out into the drainway.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever seen the drains of this neighborhood, they are filled with filth.<br /><br />What this truck driver did afterwards has just blown my brain.<br /><br />He bent down, picked up the pieces of meat from the ground and returned them to his truck.<br /><br />PHOTOS HERE: https://imgur.com/a/eCfpIZN<br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever eaten at La Boina Roja, please please please beware. Your meat is not being handled sanitary. This truck driver left the meat in the drain for close to 2 minutes before he packed it back in his truck.<br /><br />I had to leave for work so I couldn&#039;t stay much longer to see what happened, but if this is what they get away with in PUBLIC, imagine what&#039;s going on in the KITCHEN. Utterly disgusted.

				OMG! This is unbelievable. <br />To think that meat fallen out of a truck and into the drain is being served at a restaurant in Jackson Heights is so gross. For the truck driver to just pick up the meat and throw it back into the truck also means that quite possibly there was cross contamination to the other meat in the truck. This is definitely a health hazard and people visiting this restaurant should beware.<br />Thanks for bringing it to the attention of this forum. <br />

				that is absolutely disgusting. even if the driver *didn&#039;t* deliver it to another place, as the second poster said, cross-contamination put the whole load at risk. yikes!<br /><br />why, however, doesn&#039;t la boina roja just use meat from the butcher shop it owns, which is right next door? i guess this could&#039;ve been a delivery to the butcher, but usually, butcher shops pick up their meat at wholesalers. either way, yikes!

I would imagine the company has a plan for meat that falls out of the truck or is contaminated? I&#039;m just not sure what the driver should have done with the meat otherwise.

				You are tarnishing the name of this restaurant in a very unfair way.&nbsp; This was obviously a vendor, not employees of the restaurant.&nbsp; To state &quot;imagine what goes on in the kitchen&quot; because you saw someone who is not an employee of and does not work in the restaurant do something outside the restaurant that you *thought* was inappropriate is pretty much slander.&nbsp; <br />The vendor dropped the meat in the street and put it back in the truck, as opposed to bringing it into the restaurant.&nbsp; Should he have left it in the street? Did you see the meat go into the restaurant?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />As far as cross contamination from going back on the truck, it&#039;s RAW meat.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty much all cross contaminated with bacteria, as it travels with other RAW meat.&nbsp; We (generally) don&#039;t eat raw meat, we cook it first to kill potential pathogens.&nbsp; If you think that the cargo section of any meat delivery truck is sanitary you are kidding yourself. <br />

				I expect CaptainFlannel may be right.<br /><br />A trucker doesn&#039;t own his/her cargo.&nbsp; They need to make deliveries a list of customers, and probably carry additional goods in case of damage.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, the driver may need to return anything not delivered to paying customers to the warehouse, in order to demonstrate that she/he wasn&#039;t selling the extra goods on the side.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s done in some sectors, but have no idea whether that is what happened here.&nbsp; In any case, I can&#039;t see how this is a reflection on cleanliness at La Boina Roja.&nbsp;
