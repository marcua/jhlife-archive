			This pre-war, spacious two-bed, two-bath in historic Jackson Heights features a renovated kitchen with high-end appliances and a large pantry, two full bathrooms (one fully renovated), a huge living room, and oversized bedrooms with two closets each. The apartment includes hardwood floors, 9’ ceilings, Art Deco styled archways, both Eastern and Western exposures, and custom, built-in bookcases. The doors are all original with brass and crystal knobs. The electrical is up-to-date and both the living room and bedrooms are wired for ethernet and cable. The unit comes with a 6′ × 6′ storage space in the basement. The well-managed building also has bike storage, a full-time live-in super, a 24-hour laundry room with new machines, a new elevator and roof, and a private rear garden with multiple seating areas. <br /><br />https://streeteasy.com/building/35_53-77-street-jackson_heights/3g<br /><br />Contact Norm Elrod<br />718-578-9109<br />jacksonhouseapt3g@gmail.com
