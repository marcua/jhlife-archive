				Has anyone else noticed all the horse poop from the police officers? I especially see it on 82&nbsp; Street near 37 ave. they park the horse trailers and it leaks excretement.&nbsp; On tues there were two police officers on horses on the actual sidewalk on 37 ave across from the post office we had to wait for them to move so we could walk past.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know they were allowed to go on the sidewalk. Not only that but on our walk back there was a HUGE amount of horse droppings all over the street near the curb so if a wheelchair or stroller had to use the ramp near the curb they would have to wheel in it.&nbsp; Someone could have easily slipped in it. It was a massive amount. Not to mention the smell and sanitary aspects. Please don&#039;t get me wrong I love animals but if I have to clean up after my 50 lb dog Why are they allowed to CRAP where they please??????? Also what is the purpose of having police on horses in Jackson Heights where the traffic is a nightmare I don&#039;t understand it.

				I wasn&#039;t trying to ignore your pain just found the screen name/subject heading combo amusing.<br /><br />I am not sure what would remedy the problem.&nbsp; Our mayor loves to rant, maybe he could start a curb your horse campaign...he has rid the city of smoke, transfats, term limits and the right to own property...so maybe he can now turn his attention to this or add it to his task list for the City Council.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the meantime I&#039;ll watch my step crossing 82nd St.

				<br />According to the city health code, technically, no, they aren&#039;t supposed to poop on the sidewalk. But they can poop on the street, as can your dog. You could, in theory, attempt to find an official of the Departments of Health, Sanitation, or Parks and Recreation to issue a ticket to the officer if you should find them letting their horses create a nuisance on the sidewalk again. I would not care to speculate on the results of such a maneuver. <br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/public/161-03-notice.pdf<br /><br />Â§161.03 Control of dogs and other animals to prevent nuisance.<br />(a) A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog, cat or other animal shall not permit the animal<br />to commit a nuisance on a sidewalk of any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any<br />public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a<br />building abutting on a public place.<br />(b) Notices of violation for failure to comply with this section may be issued by any authorized<br />employee, officer or agent of the Department, or of the Departments of Sanitation and Parks and<br />Recreation, or successor agencies.

				Apparently horses are used in area of high traffic congestion. Probably because they can weave through cars and people much better than those 3 wheel golf cart things. <br /><br />I have often wondered who is responsible for scooping the horse poop, and while I&#039;ve considered approaching a mounted officer and confronting him / her about their disregard for NYC&#039;s pooper scooper laws I figure that conversation will not end very well. <br /><br />A call to 311, a letter to the 115th pct, etc. are probably the most viable options, but I wouldn&#039;t expect that to change anything any time soon.

				i ride my bike everyday and most of the time i have to watch out for the horse shit. i dont understand why cops are still riding around on horses. why are my tax dollars going to these pigs on horses, horses are really expensive animals to take care of. whats the point, they dont even clean anything up and i&#039;m sure they dont run after criminals while they&#039;re on horses. get rid of the horse shit!

				All the horses are donated to the police department and I believe that donation comes along with money for their care, I could be wrong. I also believe, and am willing to be wrong, that the officers who ride them put in hours above and beyond to care for them etc.<br /><br />They are very effective for crowd control and patrolling high traffic areas. More so than bikes or cars. <br /><br />While the poop may be annoying and unsanitary I don&#039;t think it requires getting rid of the mounted department. There are far greater wastes of money in the NYPD.&nbsp;

				yeah but what happens when they see someone committing a crime? are they going to run after them on their horse? that would be a funny site. then do they lasso the felons or what? if i was a robber, i would just carry a carrot with me wherever I go just in case i end up being chased by a horse. I would just throw the carrot one way and run the other way. that would probably work i think.

				It is insane to have cops on horses patrolling. It was a good idea perhaps during the 1700-1800&#039;s but we are in 2008. For crowd control it is ok. I saw a cop on a horse going the wrong way on 78th St once....I know these officers are trained but if I was a cop I rather fall off a 10 speed mountain bike rather than falling off a horse. Horses belong on farms,race tracks,open spaces,in rural areas,not in heavily populated areas.

				When I lived in Baltimore they had a lot of cops on horse back.&nbsp; The cops would chase wrong doers down alleys and off road and the horses were trained to pin the perpetrators up against a wall until back-up arrived.&nbsp; It was highly effective means of chasing people down who say were dealing drugs or breaking into cars and would easily escape by hoping a fence or running through a yard.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have to say I have noticed a rash of car break-ins in the last few months.&nbsp; If this helps, great!<br /><br />I am of the opinion that a little &quot;horse pucky&quot; never hurt anyone.&nbsp; Maybe we can post where and when there is &quot;horse pucky&quot; and the various garden committees can come to pick up their free fertilizer.&nbsp; It is the best kind you know!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Happy New Year to All!<br /><br />Had a conversation with an officer who works in Westchester County who spent his New Year&#039;s Eve at an event in White Plains, and not with his family.&nbsp; He was mounted on his horse, Mohawk, to protect the crowd from themselves and any danger that could arise.&nbsp; Thank god it was a wonderful time had by all with no incident.&nbsp; <br /><br />I told him a little bit about the thread and he did want to inform everyone who is interested that the men in uniform that patrol our communities in horses serve as public relations for the force as well as serving and protecting the community.&nbsp; This was something I had never heard before, but it made some sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems that many who see our men in uniform want to approach the officers to talk, try and pet the horse, share and very much enjoy the experience of knowing that there is some security.&nbsp; Therefore, as shared by the officer, many in the community receive a sense of comfort, security and assurance.&nbsp; The officer indicated that the children always light up and in many instances so do the adults.&nbsp; Therefore these mounted officers do bring some joy to the community.<br /><br />His horse, Mohawk, must rest every couple of hours and is very well cared for.&nbsp; During the summer there are guidelines that must be followed to protect the horse, especially as it relates to the heat.&nbsp; During the winter there are guidelines as well, as it relates to the snow, etc.&nbsp; Mohawk does use a winter blanket, especially during a New Year&#039;s Eve outing.<br /><br />As far as the poop, which is what the thread is about, the officer indicated that the poop smells awful when it first comes out but then it quickly changes in smell and texture (not my expertise and didn&#039;t want to know more).&nbsp; And yes it is a great fertilizer for the gardens.&nbsp; If Mohawk does poop on the sidewalk he will get off and pick up after his horse.<br /><br />If there is a crime being committed he will respond if close to it.&nbsp; He as well indicated that it is not a joke to be on a horse in the city.&nbsp; One example given was that it can be dangerous as there are many pot holes, which a horse can step on, and if the horse steps on one side that is not leveled this can throw an officer to the ground, which could potentially cause a severe injury.&nbsp; Thus the reason why the mounted officers may not rush to the scene of a crime if it is not close to their post, but there will be communication with the dispatcher.&nbsp; And if there is a call close to the post the officer will respond.<br /><br />Can&#039;t say anything else.&nbsp; But it was interesting speaking to someone in uniform that spoke about the topic.<br /><br />I hope this has been informative.&nbsp; HAPPY NEW YEAR!<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				yesterday two cops on horses one male/one female giving out tickets while on horses. So the horse is urinating and defacating while they&#039;re giving tickets. Isn&#039;t this what traffic agents are for??? I was walking my dog and of course I had bags to pick up his crap but what if I didn&#039;t? I would get a freaking ticket from a cop allowing his horse to crap all over. Can you believe this?? Why am I the only person upset about this? What about the folks who live on 82 St where they park the horse trailers everyday???<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Moderator note: similar topics merged.</strong>

				if i had to choose between weekends of low flying jets over jackson heights including the car alarms that are set off by them AND horse poop, i would chose horse poop anyday.&nbsp; people are stressed by different things.&nbsp; with me it&#039;s noise.

				What if we threw the poop at the airplanes?&nbsp; (I Kid I kid .. its morning!)<br /><br />Seriously though, I see the point of both complaints ... the facts remains that people walking dogs can bend and scoop a little easier than an officer mounted on a horse in full gear.&nbsp; But I could see the logic in having sanitation have street sweeping scheduled based on horse patrol days ... e.g., if JH is scheduled for Wednesday equine patrol, Thursday could be sweeping day.

				i haven&#039;t seen the poop around at all, so i can&#039;t really comment.<br /><br />oddly enough, i did witness a cop on a horse walking down 35th ave and his horse did not seem 100% under his control. it looked like he wanted the horse to go forward but the horse did not. then at one point, the horse bucked his hind legs a bit and kicked a parked car. hmmmm. i think a dented car would bother me more than horse poop.

				In this article that was mentioned earlier in the thread, according to mounted unit advocates, the horse poop is supposed to dry up and blow away.&nbsp; &nbsp; :-\<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The NY Times &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/18/nyregion/18horses.html?_r=1&amp;fta=y) <br />&quot;Although it is hard to find critics of mounted police â€” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals supports law enforcement&#039;s humane use of horses â€” some experts say their value is limited. A mounted officer, they contend, might be reluctant to leave his horse behind to chase a fleeing suspect. Ice can be a formidable foe. <br /><br />Others suggested that horses are a police department indulgence. <strong>Then there are waste-related issues, although horse manure, boosters pointed out, quickly dries up and blows away</strong>.&quot;<br /><br />
