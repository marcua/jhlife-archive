					Has it occurred to anyone that the city is reluctant to invest resources (a.k.a taxpayer money) in to a process (ULURP) that may result in the school selling the land to a developer, which seems to be Mr. Rakosi&#039;s clear intention? If the school has cold feet about a deal with the city why would the &quot;Cash-strapped&quot; city invest the time and money in to a process that would merely result in a loss because of the Garden School&#039;s need for as much cash as they can get as soon as possible? <br /><br />Again, I find it necessary to point out that the &quot;Fiduciary Responsibility&quot; of the board, seems to have not been too much of a concern to them in the years leading up to their current financial situation. Yet, all of a sudden it is key to why they can&#039;t sign a deal with the city. &nbsp;<br /><br />The school stated publicly that they would be open to some sort of loan or &quot;option&quot; in the amount of $500,000.00 to cover operating costs while the city completed the ULURP process. The community raised over $250,000.00 in response to that ask, and apparently other organizations have expressed a willingness to loan the money to the school as well. Even Mr. Rakosi admits that he was the one who supported the idea of a community based loan and apparently even offered his own money towards it. But, suddenly it&#039;s not enough. Now they need more money and an iron clad guarantee. The constantly changing story form the Garden School leads one to believe they were never negotiating in good faith to begin with. Has anyone done any research on this Mr. Rakosi and his dealings? I&#039;m very , very skeptical. <br /><br />The &quot;cash strapped&quot; city even came up with more money to offer the school. A big feat in our current economic climate. So I can&#039;t understand why people are questioning how serious the city is about buying this land ? Does it make sense to anyone out there that the politicians involved would risk their reputations and the city (which is ultimately the Mayor) would simply play a game to get us all riled up and never deliver ? <br /><br />Further, if the School is so distrustful of the city, and their surrounding community who have raised an impressive amount in a short time, why have they not signed a deal with any one of the &quot;several developers&quot; they have an offer from? Why do they drag this out yet cry that they are in desperate need of funds ASAP? Seems to me like they could have signed a deal by now. <br /><br />Maybe they should do us all a favor by signing a deal with a developer who will put up an 8 story monstrosity and let the lack of open space along with their poor reputation run the school in to the ground. Then the community can step in and buy the property an turn it in to community center that <strong>truly</strong> benefits the neighborhood. <br /><br />It is very clear that the school&#039;s main market is not the immediate community, otherwise they would listen to the parents and people here who are willing to pitch in their hard earned money to help them stay afloat and develop a valuable community resource that would ensure their reputation and longevity in the neighborhood.

					I&#039;ve watched the NY 1 story a couple of times now and I can&#039;t agree that it is fair and balanced. The story does not cover the Community&#039;s effort to help facilitate the sale of the land to the city. In fact it almost makes it seem as if the city hasn&#039;t done anything to make the deal work out. <br /><br />But what it does do is point out that the school seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth. At the meeting at Community Church a few weeks ago the representatives from the school said they wanted the deal with the city to happen but needed money to cover costs while they waited for the ULURP process to go through. However, whoever this Rakosi guy is in the NY1 piece makes it sound as if they aren&#039;t even happy with the amount of money they have been offered and don&#039;t believe there&#039;s money there at all. They can&#039;t have it both ways either they need money upfront to accept the offer or they simply don&#039;t want what has been offered. <br /><br />What&#039;s even more telling to me is his statement that his &quot;Fiduciary responsibility is greater to the students than to the community&quot;. A lot has been said on this board about how the Garden School is a part of the JH community and how we need to consider the &quot;children of Jackson Heights&quot; yet a comment like that tells me something quite different. <br /><br />If the school really wanted this deal to happen I would think they would be looking for ways to make it work rather than publicly blaming the city for not being able to accommodate their current financial situation. Where was the &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; when they started losing money ?

					There continues to be a lot of dis-information on this topic, and I can&#039;t quite tell where it&#039;s coming from. <br /><br />I attended the community meeting the other night where it was disclosed, that only about 6% of the students at the school come from Jackson Heights, the rest are from various parts of Queens. So we&#039;re talking about maybe 12 to 15 students form the immediate area, based on an enrollment of about 240. Which means Jackson Heights Children are in a significant minority.&nbsp; So, how can the innocent act of exercising one&#039;s first amendment rights be harming the &quot;children of Jackson Heights&quot;? <br /><br />It was also disclosed at that same public meeting that the parents of the students who attend the school were not adequately informed about what was going on with the board&#039;s decision to reject the city&#039;s offer. Based on the fact that the overwhelming majority of families with children in the school are NOT from the immediate area, it seems only fitting to me that the community should inform these parents about the consequences of the board&#039;s choices. <br /><br />Further, if there really were people blocking the entrance to the school or otherwise creating an obstruction, were the police called? Clearly if the children were being terrorized the responsible action would have been to inform the authorities. If not, then we have to assume the &quot;threat&quot; was minimal if it existed at all. Waiting an entire day to raise the concern without any real evidence on a local blog hardly seems like a responsible action to me. <br /><br />There&#039;s a lot of spin here and what seems like an attempt to not vilify the school. While they may not be in position to wait for the city process to be complete they should be held responsible for the consequences of their actions. <br /><br />There is a groundswell of support to make the deal with the city come to fruition. The community is willing to wok with the school, but from the negative comments and spin coming out form some people it&#039;s not so clear to me that the school is really willing to work with the community. <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame because I really was considering sending my child to the Garden School when the time comes, but this whole experience has put a bad taste in my mouth.

					I agree with you Vincent. I like that theater in Kew Gardens and don&#039;t get there often enough. Too bad the Eagle has bitten the dust. I walked by the other day and was able to look in through a hole in the gate. Seems like there&#039;s some work going on in there, the place was totally gutted.&nbsp; I doubt they are planing a totally renovated theater <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> <br /><br />

					Hi Everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. <br /><br />The dis-information on this thread is what has insprired me to finally jump in to the conversation. <br /><br />Taggie - The Tweed Courthouse was an existing property owned by the City of New York. The transfer of ownership was from one city agency to another. There was no sale of privately owned land for public use as is the case with the Garden School yard. <br /><br />If the city has been slower in its process than usual for these things, perhaps it&#039;s becasue there&#039;s some doubts that the Garden School&#039;s true intention was to sell the land to the city in the first place. If they were in negotiations with the city why did they post the land for sale publicly? Why should the city invest time and resources in to a sale that looks as if it won&#039;t go through? <br /><br />Our city doesn&#039;t always do things right, but in this instance, it appears to me they are not the ones fouling up this deal and ultimately our neighborhood.
