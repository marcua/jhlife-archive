				If you have had any good or bad mattress buying experiences in NYC, please let me know.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been sleeping on an Ikea latex/foam mix for some time, but I think I should buy a legitimate mattress.&nbsp; Sometimes when I&#039;ve slept in hotels, I&#039;ve felt much more comfortable on the hotel mattress (other times, not so much).<br /><br />I have been reluctant to actually go do anything about it because I&#039;ve always thought the mattress salespeople are in the same category as used car sales, and also, I&#039;m afraid of making the wrong choice.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Here&#039;s what you do.&nbsp; Go to Macy&#039;s and pick out your dream mattress.&nbsp; Their salespeople can be very helpful.&nbsp; When you know the name of the exact mattress you want.......go to Sleepy&#039;s to purchase.&nbsp; Just tell them you want the &quot;Stearns and Foster/Dreamaway&quot; (or whatever the silly name is) and they will sell you the same Stearns and Foster mattress from their line.&nbsp; It will have a different name attached to the brand you desire.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be alarmed.&nbsp; Each mattress seller has separate names attached to their products to make it difficult for the consumer to comparison shop.&nbsp; The Sleepy&#039;s price should be cheaper than even the Macy&#039;s sale price.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this twice in the past and it has worked out great.

				I am very interested in this feedback as well. I have had a few recommendations for tuft and needle but I have no personal experience. They are primarily a mail order outfit so not being able to try them out could be a strike against them? <br />https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/<br /><br />I am curious about Casper which looks like it has a showroom on Bond st. in NoHo. Anyone out there have any feedback about either of those? <br /><br />We had a terrible experience with a pricey pillow topped Sterns and Foster purchased at a Sleepy&#039;s. It lasted only a year and a half before developing uncomfortable troughs despite regular rotation. More about these issues in general here: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/furniture/stearns_foster.html<br /><br />After that we went with one of the cheapest Ikea mattresses with two egg crate type foam toppers from BBB. Part of the overall trouble is that several of the major brands are made by the same manufacturer. Consumer reports also seems to do impartial evaluations of these each year so perhaps that could help. Not sure if this info is available for free online or not.<br />

				Just to be clear.&nbsp; I was in no way advocating a Stearns and Foster mattress.&nbsp; I was simply advising a process by which to purchase the mattress you desire at a cheaper price.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				They certainly do change the names all the time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would suggest doing a little research online as to what type of mattress is best suited to the type of sleeper you are........ie. side sleeper, back sleeper, stomach sleeper.&nbsp; It makes a difference.&nbsp; A good salesperson can help you navigate the products if they know what kind of a sleeper you are.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />My last purchase was an expensive Stearns and Foster.&nbsp; In the end, I believe I chose one that was too soft......but, at the time, I did it to appease someone else.&nbsp; Mistake!&nbsp;

				You might enjoy this episode about mattresses of the podcast Surprisingly Awesome which basically starts with the same premise of being scared to choose a mattress (and eventually actually has done advice amidst the humor).&nbsp; &nbsp;You can read the transcript or download it here: https://gimletmedia.com/episode/12-mattresses/

				I hate mattress shopping. I&#039;ve done what was suggested before, and gone to all the mattress stores on Queens Blvd across from Target, plus the Macys furniture showroom. The salespeople are aware of this strategy and none of them would tell me the name of the mattress I liked. I ended up ordering something off Sears.com sight unseen. 7 years later, I&#039;m glad to be rid of the mattress. <br /><br />I recently got a new mattress, was looking to avoid the earlier experience, so looked specifically at direct-to-customer brands, like Casper. I made an appt at the Casper showroom in Soho. They give you a pillow, lead you to a room with a queen sized bed, and you try it out for 30 minutes. You can nap if you want. I jumped around on it, rolled around, laid down, etc. After you&#039;re done, you can ask any questions you want. I also went to the Leesa showroom in Soho and did the same, and ended up ordering one right there. I also used this peer-review blog for mattresses that i found very helpful: sleepopolis.com <br /><br />PS. Its been about 40 days into the 100 day trial for my new Leesa, and I like it!

				After a bedbug nightmare, I got mine from Essentia...there&#039;s a showroom on 34th Street.&nbsp; Organic Latex...and possibly the most comfortable thing I&#039;ve ever slept on.&nbsp; It&#039;s pricey, but worth it in my opinion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard excellent things about the Casper and took a 15 minute nap on one last week.&nbsp; Had I not bought the one I had and needed a new mattress, I&#039;d probably get it due to the price point versus the one I have.<br /><br />Good luck! The right mattress is SO important.

				Thanks for the responses so far.&nbsp; I did end up calling Stearns and Foster and gave them the model number of the mattress I had slept on at my friend&#039;s house.&nbsp; They confirmed it was manufactured between 2002-04 only, and they told me that it roughly corresponds with an Estate collection firm with pillow top, but when I brought up the issue of different retailers (like Macy&#039;s vs Sleepy&#039;s) selling mattresses under different names, all she could tell me was that I could call back if I found something I liked and wanted to check on how it compared to the one I liked from 2002-4.<br /><br />What a frustrating business this is to deal with!

				Hmm am I crazy or were their posts on this topic that came after the 31st that are now missing? I have my old one ( I think from the 2nd?) so I will repost.&nbsp; Anyone else have their old messages?<br /><br />My previous, super long message: <br /><br />What an incredibly helpful conversation. Thanks to you all for your feedback. I am adding Leesa to my list of ones to check out. <br /><br />Shelby2, So have you fully committed to S&amp;F brand? Also can I ask, was the bed you slept on at your friends&#039; place in their primary sleeping space or in a second bedroom? <br /><br />I am reluctant to try and sway you but ours was a truly terrible experience. What we found was basically when you run into trouble with a large mattress maker there is this test used to prove if what you have is defective. It is a joke. Without allowing you to lay on it at the same time, this person supposedly comes out to measure the depth of the indentation. If it is more than 1.5 inches deep they will replace it. Otherwise sorry charlie. I didn&#039;t go through myself because I didn&#039;t want to pay the fee for their visit. Without my weight on it I couldn&#039;t get that measurement so why would they. But man, was this thing unbearably uncomfortable. After owning it for only 18 months I found myself waking night after night, half of my body falling asleep because of my trough. We felt we had little choice but to dump it and go with a cheaper Ikea one to get us though. Thankfully that thing has been a champ for the past 2 years. And for the record my husband and I are both of average weight for our heights so that did not factor in creating this issue. We also had this placed on a box spring on a frame, not a slat or platform bed or on the floor..so not sure how that factored in as well.<br /><br />Also as a sidebar Stearns &amp; Foster and Bassett are both owned by Sealy. It could stand to reason that the quality of those three brands is comparable despite premium pricing. Something else to consider perhaps?<br /><br />Before my Sterns and Foster debacle I had a lovely (I think it was) Serta that I bought over the phone from 1-800-mattress. It was the very cheapest sized queen bed on offer. That thing held up amazingly well for over 15 years. Who knows what that brand&#039;s quality has become over the years. But it sure was great while it lasted.<br /><br />One last thing: What I find most maddening is how the major bands now exclusively make one sided mattresses (irrespective of pillow top or not). So they are no longer are flippable. Basically that seems like you are shaving off half the useful life. Anyone come across a brand that is still made two sided? Please share. I&#039;d gladly go down that old tech path and add my own pillow top or memory foam mattress topper. Let&#039;s face it this process is not so fun..so I want to find something good and have it last at least a decade.
