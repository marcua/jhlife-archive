				Hello. We moved to NYC eight months ago and we found an apartment in Jackson Heights through a friend. We really like the diversity and the energy of Jackson Heights, so we thought we might have a gander at some apartments. We found a small apt for sale in Roosevelt Terrace and we like the price and location. However I am a little confused about the land lease. Will we be able to sell the apartment when we finish school, and maybe move back to the Seattle area? Does anyone know when the current lease will expire?

				Funny you bring this up -- the NYT just did an article about buildings in NYC with land leases.<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/realestate/rising-costs-a-concern-for-land-lease-building-owners-in-new-york.html<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know Roosevelt Terrance fell into this category of buildings (very uncommon), but a quick search here shows that it indeed is likely possible (and probably also a non-issue):<br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4459.30

				Yes indeed! The NYT article prompted our post re. the Roosevelt Terrace land lease. We will not make a formal offer, as we do not want to assemble all the paper work without concrete information, to do with the existing length and terms of lease.<br /><br />We are hoping that our realtor will come up the necessary info.<br /><br />Many thanks for all the responses.<br /><br />

				RT was developed in the early 50s, so a 99 year land lease would put the current lease expiration at 2050ish.

				The current lease will end in 2050. However, there is a renewal clause and that is what will happen. <br /><br />I moved into Roosevelt Terrace with my parents in 1954. We bought our apartment in 1981. There is nothing to be concerned about with regard to the land lease issue. The Board of Directors has the situation under control. They will take the renewal and keep the annual rent as it has been since the beginning. <br /><br />I would advise anyone who is considering looking and buying a place to come over and check us out. Not only is the land lease not an issue, but this coop has a large reserve fund and a great operating fund as well. This is definitely a safe investment but also a great place to live<br />

				The land rent is nominal for the parcel. I think the lease expires in 2/2052, that&#039;s what was on my coop questionnaire. You may not be able to finance a 30 year mortgage as the land lease is 36 years out, and banks get a bit wary the closer to 30 years it goes. At the price paid for the land rent, the coop will probably just renew, it&#039;s peanuts for a parcel worth over $2 million.
