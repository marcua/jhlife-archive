				Maybe she can see what bad service is offered to local residents. Really a shame that this hospital lacks many modern amenities. <br /><br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/nancy-pelosi-to-visit-elmhurst-for-community-discussion-next-week

				I have gone done for very minor emergencies and have had to wait for 24 hours to leave the emergency room. I am sure at other private hospitals, I would of been out of there in a few hours. The lack of modern equipment compared to other hospitals is appalling. The rating system gives very low marks to this hospital. The facility is 3rd rate.

				Recently had an experience at the Weill Cornell ER on the Upper East Side and it was no picnic there, either. It took over 24 hours to get out of the ER, and if admission to the hospital had been necessary, we were told that it might have taken days of staying in the ER before that could happen. <br /><br />Regarding Elmhurst , it is supposed to be an excellent trauma center, staffed by doctors from the Mt. Sinai system. A previous ER experience there turned out fine, except for the fact that I was appalled at how dirty the place was. I am not a germophobe and have never reacted this way in any other situation, but I refused to even sit in a chair in that place, it was so dirty overall. I took a shower the minute I got home from there, at 5 AM.

				I wish I had the time today to write everything that I want to about NY Presby. I have to make it short/sweet. Hope to share my full story later. It is really interesting.<br /><br />NYP is over-utilized and under appreciated. If you complain about it, what you really don&#039;t like is our society. The place is required to treat the indigent, the undocumented, criminals and their victims, the incarcerated, and the deathly ill and injured in excessive numbers. Everything under the sun at little to no cost in the shortest time possible. It is a miracle that anyone would be treated at all for a &quot;minor emergency&quot; or a non life threatening medical issue. <br /><br />Thank g-d for it.

				Elmhurst has serious overcrowding, handcuffed criminals with six police officers guarding each, lack of basic supplies, old outdated heart monitors, overworked staff, roaches in the bathroom, lack of privacy in rooms. The saddest part is every year multimillion payouts from city taxpayers to cover negligence that occurs at the hospital. These sometimes outrageous verdicts mean there is less money to buy basic equipment. That is our system.

				Racial harmony and diversity does not equate with best practices. While it is great to see that people get along under stressful conditions, this does not translate into quality patient care.

				If I&#039;m lying in a hospital bed or on an operating table I don&#039;t care who my doctors or nurses are, don&#039;t care where they are from, all I care is that they are GOOD at their jobs and that we can both understand/communicate with each other.<br /><br />While &quot;Racial Harmony&quot; is a great thing, I don&#039;t see why it is a desirable thing in every facet of life.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t something that crosses my mind going into a hospital ward.&nbsp; But in 2019 EVERYTHING is about race, diversity, and identitarianism.

				Exactly my sentiments.&nbsp; I&#039;m a health care provider who has worked in several hospital settings and can vouch for this.&nbsp; Focus on &quot;competent&quot; professionals with the ability to effectively communicate is paramount . Presently,&nbsp; the concept&nbsp; of &quot;diversity&quot; has been altered and&nbsp; is used to divide people.&nbsp; Divided by race.&nbsp; Divided by sexuality/gender. Divided by religion. Who benefits?

For some, this may be the only way to get quality care. Think outside yourself sometime.
