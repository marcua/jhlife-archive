				I hear people openly complain about graffiti but what about garbage on streets.&nbsp; As we all know, the 73rd street and 74th street between 37th ave and 35th ave is filled with garbage.&nbsp; Subway entrance on 73rd and 37th Road gives really bad impression for people who just arrived Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Yet, people&nbsp; are afraid to openly complain about the situation on 73rd and 74th street probably because they don&#039;t want to be considered to be attacking one ethnic group.&nbsp; But the street is shared by everybody and people should respect the public space. If a certain ethnic group does not have a civic sense and not respect the public, I believe it should be criticized and they should learn to respect others.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to hear your opinion.

				Please address the problem without making baseless and offensive inferences about ethnic groups. <br /><br />In fact, there are plenty of people who are not afraid to address the problem.&nbsp; Instead of insulting their neighbors, they are actually working together to solve it.&nbsp; The problem stems from the fact that this is a very busy and crowded commercial district, and the level of sanitation service the city provides is not adequate to keep the area clean.&nbsp; The Western Jackson Heights Alliance, the 74th Street Merchants Association, and other groups are working to raise funds to address it.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you volunteer to help them out?

				The last time I heard was&nbsp; the 74th street Merchants Association is not working with Western Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Just ask Will Sweeny to make the fact straight. And it seems like they refused to form the BID since they don&#039;t want to spend any money for community.&nbsp; <br /><br />&gt;and the level of sanitation service the city provides is not adequate to keep the area clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />I disagree.&nbsp; I am not talking about garbage can being full.&nbsp; I am talking about things like stylefone box with chicken and rice thrown on the streets.&nbsp; &nbsp;How can you blame city for such garbages?&nbsp; Yes, we can raise the money and have somebody else clean the streets.&nbsp; &nbsp; But why can&#039;t&nbsp; we individuals respect the public and each individuals takes responsible for the garbage?&nbsp; All I am proposing is that <br /><br />Current situation:<br /><br />Pedestrian has trash.<br />Releases fingers.<br />Trash falls on ground.<br />Creates eyesore.<br /><br />Proposed situation:<br />Pedestrian has trash.<br />Walks a few extra steps to trash can.<br />Releases fingers OVER trash can.<br />Pedestrian no longer has trash.<br />Street still clean.<br /><br /><br />Todd, I believe there is difference between being a racist and respecting public.&nbsp; All i am trying to have people respect public.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				I would love to see a &quot;Don&#039;t Litter&quot; program in the public schools, especially the elementary schools. I do think there is a cultural element (although I think it applies to quite a few cultures) where it is considered more permissible to litter. It would be great to have kids influencing their parents to change their ways. This is New York City, and a certain amount of litter is inevitable, I suppose, but it would be nice to try to minimize it. It also seems like bags of garbage are often ripped open in the morning along 74th Street, which doesn&#039;t help.<br /><br />I so vividly remember the &quot;crying chief&quot; ad of my youth, and it&#039;s kind of interesting that there seem to be no anti-litter public service ads anymore. I wonder why?<br /><br />I know the Doe Fund was working on some streets, but I don&#039;t think there was funding for a full-time Doe Fund. I am not sure if this comes from grant money, but maybe that could be explored. My understanding is the majority of 74th Street property is owned by one landlord who does not feel the need to contribute to a BID.<br /><br />

				The garbage problem goes beyond 74th street. In fact I think 82nd street is far dirtier. 37th ave and Roosevelt are also dirty. <br /><br />Most people make an effort to throw their garbage away, however the trash cans provided by the city are often overflowing. It is sort of like playing Jinga, you have to think about how to add your trash into the pile without causing it to collapse. The city could should empty the cans more frequently.

				I totally agree with what Brian said about 74th St., it is very dirty and I doubt the comment was meant to sound racist.&nbsp; :o I have lived in JH for 32 yrs and 74th St like 82nd St has always been filled with commercial stores.&nbsp; The difference between now and then is now its filthy and then the people who owned those stores kept there streets cleaned and the community didn&#039;t come together to keep it clean for them.&nbsp; I really feel people do not care as much now as they did years ago.&nbsp; Now, its all about someone else keeping the street clean?&nbsp; What about the people who own or rent these stores?&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t they help to clean the street they have there business on?&nbsp; Todd, I think we should stick to the Topic of keeping the street clean and not trying to make this sound &quot;racist&quot;. &gt;:(

				I think if the OP wanted to simply talk about the problem of garbage on the street and what to do about it, he would not have mentioned that he feels one certain ethnic group is responsible for the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with both Dawnie and Todd - if the topic is&nbsp; garbage on the street, then let&#039;s talk about garbage on the street and how to solve the problem, and not bring race and ethnicity into the equation.

				Shelby, I think in this case, cultural difference is a part of problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;What Brian is saying is let&#039;s face it and try to solve it rather than disregarding it as complaint from racists.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had to disagree with Todd&#039;s approach of &quot;having someone else keeping the street clean&quot;. &nbsp;It is not a fundamental solution to the problem on 74th street.<br />So what can we do? &nbsp;One of the solution can be to raise the awareness for store owners and shopper there. &nbsp;But how?? &nbsp;Teaching kids in school is one thing we can do.&nbsp; But it is gonna take too long time to see the effect. &nbsp;Any idea? &nbsp;maybe launch some kind of campaign with the help of community board or JHBG?? &nbsp; Or have marchants form BID?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks Chuckster. I think by what you said is the problem, no one hoses the streets or sidewalks off anymore with boiling water and soap.&nbsp; It is so easy to do and so helpful for people who live or shop in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame!&nbsp; And I agree with you about the foul smell, every morning I gag from the smell!!<br />&nbsp; Not a good feeling!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;:(

				I have only lived here a few months, but I was shocked to see that most stores do not take any responsibility for their sidewalks.&nbsp; Jackson Diner is a perfect example; (I pass it to and from work each day) they have smelly mushy waste on their walk daily.&nbsp; Why isn&#039;t it their responsibility to properly bag their waste and clean up if/when a spill occurs?&nbsp; There is a mess outside EVERY DAY - what if all the restaurants did that?&nbsp; It would be a huge vermin magnet!!&nbsp; I wish the cops in the neighborhood (who seem to have a presence on 74th in the evenings lately) would issue summons for failure to maintain the sidewalk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why aren&#039;t the shops of 74th responsible for sweeping and scrubbing?&nbsp; ESPECIALLY since the street is so heavily trafficked?&nbsp; :tickedoff:<br /><br />Oh, and did anyone notice the sign that the management company posted at 35-48 73rd?&nbsp; There used to be garbage on the walk every day, and they must have gotten tickets because the sign says that anyone who disposes of trash on a non-collection day will be responsible for any related fines...&nbsp; I actually saw a rat running back and forth between the building and the trash bags one night.&nbsp; blech.

				We do have a problem with garbage on our commercial streets in Jackson Heights. Some members of the Western Jackson Heights Alliance have been focusing on this problem. To solve this issue, members of the WJHA have started by building relationships with the merchants and businesses in the area. In addition to working with local business interests, the WJHA has connected with city agencies. In June, the WJHA had a town hall meeting with the director of Community Outreach for the Department of Sanitation. As a result of this meeting, we were able to get more garbage cans on 73rd and 74th Street. <br /><br />However, more garbage cans are not enough. The problem appears to be multi-faceted. The most chronically dirty streets are also the most active. Most of the businesses in this area are small operations with limited labor resources. In addition, the city has allowed for street vendors without provisions for additional sanitation services. I believe that the best way to combat dirty streets in our area is for a coordinated and consistent program that cleans sidewalks, streets and other public areas.&nbsp; The WJHA recently partnered with the Jackson Heights Community Journal to apply for the NYC Clean Streets program for Jackson Heights. <br /><br />The NYC Clean Streets program www.nyc.gov/cleanstreets (http://www.nyc.gov/cleanstreets) is designed to help communities combat dirty streets. NYC Clean Streets is a new initiative, the goal of which is to develop the capacity of neighborhood-based organizations in commercial districts throughout the City. Through NYC Clean Streets, the Small Business Services Dept offers a comprehensive sanitation and maintenance program to selected local neighborhood organizations and engages those organizations in a capacity-building relationship so that they will be able to independently manage and finance the program after two years.<br /><br />Under the program, the cost for supplemental sanitation and maintenance services will be provided entirely by the City in the first year of the program and on a matching basis in the second year, with the City contributing 75% of the sanitation and maintenance program costs and selected organizations contributing 25%. Over the course of the second year of the program, organizations will be required to raise 100% of the cost for supplemental sanitation services in the third year.<br /><br />I believe that the Clean Streets program would be a perfect fit for our area. It would be paid for by the city for the first year and then gradually the cost of the program would be absorbed by local businesses. The application was filed two weeks ago and we will find out if JH is included by June of this year. Practically, if JH gets the program, it would be a tremendous help. The program would add two full-time street cleaners to the area five days a week. The program would help arrange additional sanitation pick-ups, more garbage cans, and an educational outreach program for merchants. <br /><br />If anyone is interested in helping out with this program or other initiatives, email us at info@wjha.org. <br /><br /><br />

				Is there any truth to claims that the merchants on 74th Street have not demonstrated an interest in forming a BID?&nbsp; If so, why?&nbsp; While the NYC Clean Streets initiative sounds like a viable solution for the future, I still don&#039;t understand why some of the larger merchants, such as Patel and Jackson Diner simply cannot clean the streets directly in front of their businesses on a regular basis.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine that a daily, simple sweep or hose down of the street would be that costly.&nbsp; Or is this just too naive of a plan?

				I&#039;ve also seen some seriously gross stuff on the sidewalks during my early morning walk along 74th St to the train station.&nbsp; Is it possible that what we&#039;re seeing is the result of sloppy garbage collection the night before that hasn&#039;t had a chance to be hosed down yet by the store owners because they haven&#039;t shown up yet?&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that that kind of stuff is still there by late morning when restaurants are preparing to open for lunch.&nbsp; If I were a restaurant patron and I saw something that looked like massive amounts of puke in front of a restaurant, I would choose to go to another restaurant.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying maybe what we&#039;re seeing in the early morning is probably being addressed when we&#039;re at work.&nbsp; By the time I come home in the late afternoon, there&#039;s no sign of the nastiness from the morning.

				Garbage on the street is one thing but, yesterday I was VERY UPSET when I saw a woman (I shouldn&#039;t even give her that title) holding her 2 or 3yr old son next to her Mercedes Benz and letting him urinate on the street like some animal.&nbsp; I was appalled by this and said something to her.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why anyone would do this especially when it was in front of a food store (Trade Fair) and across the street are several stores the Mother could have taken her son into use there facilities.&nbsp; Of course I said something but as I did so, I twisted my ankle (and had to get home asap because the twist was pretty bad) enough about me, I just don&#039;t understand why people from different Countries come into this Country and make it dirty when they have so many choices to keep it clean?&nbsp; Is it just ignorance or laziness?&nbsp; All I know is I was raised a very different way.

				In my opinion a lot of the behavior considered by most people as socially unacceptable does have to do with cultural upbringing.&nbsp; This is not to say that those born and raised in this country may not be guilty of similar social infractions.&nbsp; Keep in mind that many, not all, of today&#039;s immigrants come from environments that are literally a world apart from what we are accustomed to in the United States.&nbsp; Hence, social norms may differ greatly based on economics, education, etc.&nbsp; What may be considered acceptable behavior in a foreign country is frowned upon here. <br /><br />Not naming any particular country, my brother once shared his experiences while he traveled abroad.&nbsp; He explained how on one of his travels, he witnessed how adults and children alike would just drop their pants at any given moment when the need would arise.&nbsp; Mind you, he was traveling through a very poor area of the country, whereas, in what he called &quot;the city&quot;, this type of behavior was banned.

				I agree that individuals&#039; sense of entitlement and lack of civic pride is central to this problem.<br /><br />The point Shelby2 and I have been trying to make is that we need to confront the problem in this vein, not explain it away as due to &quot;cultural differences.&quot;&nbsp; Individuals who feel they are part of a community, and not alienated from it, will be much more likely to have civic pride and concern for their neighbors&#039; quality of life.&nbsp; We need a positive, inclusive strategy for demonstrating that Jackson Heights values clean, attractive public spaces.&nbsp; Hopefully the leadership that JH Community Journal and the Western JH Alliance are playing on this issue will begin to pay off.<br /><br />In my hometown of Stony Brook, NY, way out in the suburbs, the trash cans in the village center used to carry a quote from Abraham Lincoln: &quot;I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;This may sound corny, but as a kid, those trash cans were actually a source of community pride for me.&nbsp; The Lincoln quote is probably a bit stuffy and heavy handed for Jackson Heights... but something with a cool logo or slogan that conveys community unity and pride could be a start.<br /><br />

How many of any diverse community are working (and praying) for the day they can return to their country. I don&#039;t believe that people with cultural differences feel alienated from the community as too many of them are nowhere planning on making it their home. Jackson Heights, just like Astoria and many other small communities in Queens, The Bronx and Brooklyn are magnets for immigrant assemblage. When they think &quot;home&quot; they are thinking &quot;my country&quot; and that country is not the U.S. You may try to incorporate their cultural differences into the program of making them responsible to the community-at-large, but those differences will always remain. People tend to group together for the commonality of thought and socio-economic backgrounds. These pockets of people tend to have the type of &quot;ghetto mentality&quot; that they came here in order to escape. Historically, they have proven that they don&#039;t want to blend, they chose to be with their own and that they don&#039;&#039;t believe in the &quot;melting pot&quot; mind frame. It takes generations to become a part of. The Jews did it. The Italians did it. The Irish did it. This new group of immigrants will also do it . . . in time.<br /><br />Until then, let&#039;s gently and politely tell someone we see littering or spitting on the street that is isn&#039;t considered a nice thing to do.

				I see all these comment made about &quot;immigrants&quot; and what not,&nbsp; about the way some behave and i agree with the fact that all the immigrants that have come to this county all adapted over many years, Irish, Italians, everyone etc... but majority of people here fear change and hate change. For example let it be the non-foreigner who is use to there environment, once a immigrant shows up and they show some sort of different behavior = change = change in the non-foreigners environment = fear,or a generalizations is made,&nbsp; which leads to complaints and unfortunately one immigrant or foreigner w.e. you people are calling them, has to spoil for the rest. Not all immigrants are alike it all depends where you are from and how one is raised in there country = social class pretty much. So instead of finding who to blame or point the finger at who is doing what we are all immigrants unless you are native American, we were brought up differently and we should all work together to make thing happen instead of finding someone to blame and than make is seem like your not blaming anyone specially when in reality you know very well what your talking about. Face the truth, anyone can talk about change its about making it happen. Actions speak louder than words, other than complaining here, next time when you see something that you know isn&#039;t right than say something but if your just gonna come on and complain about but never do anything than why bother, your just depending on others, and that leads to no change.&nbsp; :D <br /><br />

				Francis, thank you very much for your information.<br /><br />I am relatively new to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; So, the information like this is very helpful.&nbsp; I also learned that in the past there was a rally against Merchants in 74th street not taking responsibility of their street organized by JHBG.&nbsp; That tells you lot of people have been concerned about the 74th street.<br /><br />I would like to bring this up again at town hall meetings and community board 3 meetings.&nbsp; Could someone tell me how to do this?&nbsp; Is this a matter of making a call to the community board?

				Hey Brian--The simple thing to do is to call community Board 3 and log your compliant with them as well as contacting Helen Sears.&nbsp; With that said--a bit of a warning if you do decide to attend a community board 3 meeting.&nbsp; The community board at times can be somewhat divisive and consist of many opposing view points and political agendas.&nbsp; Again,&nbsp; in the past, when I have confronted them, they told me that they--the merchants-- were responsible for the revitalization of the area.&nbsp; They accused me of discrimination for singularizing the particular street.&nbsp; While poor sanitation does not equate with positive economic growth in my eyes, it does create a negative image of the community, especially when existing the train station. My feeling is that the merchants are guest in our neighborhood and as such should try to appease the people who live here!&nbsp; Surely,&nbsp; &quot;clean&quot; is color blind.

				<br />Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Great news!&nbsp; Jackson Heights was selected in the highly prized competitive program - the NYC Clean Streets program - to keep neighborhood streets clean.&nbsp; We were just notified that we were one of a few of the groups selected for the Clean Streets program.&nbsp; The Community Journal, a pending 501 (c) 3 non-profit, will administrate the program. <br /><br />The Western Jackson Heights Alliance was a lead partner in the application along with support from&nbsp; many local merchants and community-based-organizations including the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, New Immigrant Community Empowerment (NICE) and Chhaya Community Economic Development corporation, to name a few.&nbsp; The application was also strongly supported by Assemblyman Jose Peralta and Council Member Hiram Monserrate.<br /><br />The Clean Streets initiative will add two street cleaners for eight hours per day to the Jackson Heights gateway area of 73rd Street and 74th Street between Roosevelt Avenue and 37th Avenue five days a week, Thursday through Sunday beginning in November 2008.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the sanitation services through the Clean Streets program will be supplemental to normal city sanitation services and any pre-existing supplemental services such as the Doe Fund services provided by Assemblyman Jose Peralta.<br /><br />To learn how to support the Clean Streets program in Jackson Heights contact the Community Journal at communityjournal@gmail.com or call 718-393-7711.&nbsp; There will be an article on this new neighborhood initiative in the next edition of the Community Journal in June.<br /><br />Bryan Pu-Folkes<br />

				I have to agree 73rd street and 74th street being considered as a toilet of NYC from outsiders.&nbsp; I had several friends who are amazed how dirty the streets are.<br />The state of 73rd and 74th street may not be just Helen&#039;s fault. If people in that area respect the public and don&#039;t litter, then there is no garbage in the first place or merchants on the area respect the public and keep cleaning the their store front, then there will be no garbage, either.&nbsp; But for some reason, people who hang out around 73rd and 74th street don&#039;t respect the public.&nbsp; So now at least city can put some efforts to control those two streets.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know there are lot of old folks live in that area.&nbsp; And those old people are the one who are the victims of the Helen and merchants who are only interested in<br />making money.&nbsp; This is classic battle -business interests vs environment.&nbsp; And Helen are supporting the business interests because she received fundings from merchants.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is so sad..&nbsp; If merchants can afford to give money to Helen, they should form BID and hire people to clean their street constantly.<br /><br />

				I wonder how Forest Hills made this happen? &nbsp;Great if we could too!<br /><br />Ready, Willing &amp; Able &gt; Work Assignments &gt; Street Cleaning<br />The Ready, Willing &amp; Able Community Improvement Project is a street cleaning initiative. Dressed in bright blue uniforms with the American flag on the sleeve and the Ready, Willing &amp; Able logo on the back, trainees work in crews with one Site Supervisor per crew. Their responsibilities include sweeping streets, collecting and bagging refuse, removing graffiti, cleaning street furniture, steam cleaning sidewalks and awnings and shoveling snow.<br />Since July 2000, The Doe Fund has significantly increased the areas covered by the Community Improvement Project, which provides the job opportunities that are at the core of our philosophy and the Ready, Willing &amp; Able program. Not only have we secured contracts for cleaning areas in Manhattan, but in Brooklyn and Queens as well, generating visibility for The Doe Fund in new neighborhoods and increased community support for the program. Crews now maintain Hudson River Park in Manhattan, Forest Hills in Queens, and Court, Montague and Fulton Streets in Brooklyn. Ready, Willing &amp; Able also has crews maintaining areas in Jersey City and most recently, Ready, Willing &amp; Able Philadelphia crews are cleaning Fairmont Park. The Doe Fund continues to seek out contracts to clean more neighborhoods throughout New York City. The upcoming replication project in Bushwick will allow us to enlarge our work force.<br /><br />Community residents and local businesses have responded with overwhelming enthusiasm to this project. With their support, the Community Improvement Project has expanded. In their work to improve the streets on which they once slept, the program&#039;s participants have done much to transform perceptions of the homeless as &quot;lazy, unwilling and unable to work.&quot; At the same time, the Community Improvement Project has been an important means of generating recognition and private support for Ready, Willing &amp; Able.<br /><br />Ready, Willing &amp; Able crews have installed steel trash bins at various intersections. The bins are maintained by program crews and display the Ready, Willing &amp; Able logo prominently along the side. The Doe Fund has received much praise from the local community regarding these bins and many requests to install them along the surrounding streets.

				I agree.&nbsp; It is a shame that you would have to fine people but it is really something that should be taking care of on their own.&nbsp; My two previous jobs had street fronts and I used to go out every morning and sweep up.&nbsp; That is just what you do.&nbsp; Pretty soon all my neighbors started doing it and we would all chit chat, have our coffee, sweep and then go back inside and work.&nbsp; It was actually rather nice.&nbsp; If you care about your business you want it to look nice from the outside.&nbsp; Every other month, would would pay someone to pressure wash the sidewalks.&nbsp; It really didn&#039;t cost that much at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				As stated by Bryan in post #51 above, 73rd and 74th Streets will be receiving supplemental street cleaning as part of the New York City Clean Streets Program.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve read so far, this additional help will be initially financed by the City and is scheduled to begin this November.&nbsp; The program will continue for two years with a focus on having participants in the program ultimately be able to maintain cleaner streets on their own.&nbsp; This all means that we have some cleaner streets to look forward to this Fall!<br /><br /><em><strong>&quot;The goal of the program is to build the capacity of selected partner organizations so that they are capable of independently financing and managing their sanitation programs at the close of the two-year initiative.&quot;</strong></em><br /><br />You can read more about how the program works here:<br /><br />New York City Clean Streets Program (http://www.nyc.gov/html/sbs/downloads/pdf/nyccleanstreetsinformationsheet.pdf)

				Brian, I watched your itube video.&nbsp; I have to agree with todd on two points: 1. At the top of your video it APPEARS to be a residential building. The Dept. of Sanitation should be fining them for the litter.&nbsp; The Dept. of Sanitation has fined our building in the past because the garbage pick up was so sloppy that garbage littered the sidewalk. And the Super hadn&#039;t gotten out to clean it yet. It&#039;s a hefty fine. Even when it isn&#039;t the building&#039;s fault, it is the building&#039;s responsibility to clean up their sidewalks and even gutters, I think.&nbsp; <br /><br />and 2.&nbsp; JHlife comprises a group of us online.&nbsp; I wish you would not use the name as though you were speaking for anyone but your self.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t agree with you; the garbage situation is unacceptable.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think you should be using the name of a site that represents a large group of people.&nbsp; Why couldn&#039;t you come up with your own moniker?&nbsp; <br /><br />The last thing is in the video no where do you show that this is Jackson Heights or where in Jackson Heights this was done.&nbsp; It could be footage of anywhere.&nbsp; If you do reshoot, make sure NOT to have faces (which I got the feeling you are already aware of that) but show a street sign and if a face shows, blur it out.<br /><br />But I think shining a light on the garbage may have an impact over time.&nbsp; Well done, Brian.<br /><br />

				Thank you for your word, buddy.<br />the video and photo was shot on 73rd street.&nbsp; the first location was on a residential house.&nbsp; I have a big sympathy for the owner of the this house because I have seen people litter on this property all the time and the owner has to keep the area clean all the time.&nbsp; I am sure the owner of this building clean up the street much more often than the merchants.&nbsp; The day I took a picture was during the forth of july weekend.&nbsp; And I think the owner was away for a few days.&nbsp; And people on 73rd street kept littering. <br /><br />&nbsp;Todd, I found it very strange that you criticize the owner of the building instead of people who litter.&nbsp; Everyone who are living on 73rd street knows that owner of the building usually clean up many times a day and he should not be criticized and people are very sympathetic to the owner.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why you want to defend people who litter on 73rd and 74th streets?&nbsp; &nbsp; If people don&#039;t litter in the first place, there is no garbage.&nbsp; Can&#039;t you realize this?&nbsp; <br /><br />The second part of the video was on close to the corner of 37th road and 73rd street which is in front of Kebab king.&nbsp; This is the most polluted area on 73rd street.&nbsp; on top of the people who litter, kebab king owner don&#039;t clean up the street enough.&nbsp; And half part of this area should be cleaned up by Eagle theatre because according to Kebab king, that area belong to Eagle theatre.&nbsp; I have seen rats running around this area.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will take buddy&#039;s advice and I will shoot street signs to prove that this is happening on 73rd street and 74th street.

				Brian...even though I have not seen the pictures you took or the video&#039;s, I know exactly what is on them.&nbsp; I live in The Birchwood House with a terrace on the side of the building closest to Broadway.&nbsp; I know exactly what it&#039;s like.&nbsp; I know the filth that is left on the street from the Kebab King and from the Food Vendors and their customers who throw their empty food containers and coffee cups in the street.<br /><br />The Eye Doctor across the street has had problems keeping people from sitting on the steps of his house.&nbsp; We&#039;ve spoken to the doctor and have witnessed people sitting on his steps actually not moving from the steps when patients enter or leave the office.&nbsp; The doctor and his staff claim that they have been threatened so they do nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Also our building cleans every morning the sidewalks in front of the building.&nbsp; It&#039;s not long after that,&nbsp; that already there will be garbage on the sidewalks again because someone walked by and threw their coffee cup on the ground, or the wind blows the garbage from the side of the movie theater to our building.&nbsp; The responsibility for the garbage are the people who come to shop in the area&nbsp; and they are not German,&nbsp; Irish, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Japanese etc.&nbsp; They are from Indian, Pakistan and&nbsp; Bangla Desh.&nbsp; So let&#039;s stop beating around the bush and pinpoint the culprits who dirty our street.&nbsp; At fault also are the merchants that allow this to happen.&nbsp; Speak to someone from India that has been here for many years and they will be the first to tell you that that&#039;s the way it is in India.&nbsp; Garbage gets thrown on the ground and streets are dirty and smelly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just recently from my terrace I saw a woman lift her Sari and squat down by a tree and urinate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson Heights has always been a very diversified area and I can tell you that no woman from Germany, Ireland, Korean, Japan or any Spanish country has lifted up her dress and urinated by a tree.&nbsp;

				(This is why I donâ€™t post on <em>Jackson Heights Life</em> much.) Kabab King and the street vendors at 73rd Street and 37th Road certainly do need to contribute to the fight against litter, but there are also a number of (Western-looking) individuals who sleep on the sidewalk near the same intersection sprawled out in such a way that pedestrians can barely pass. I moved into Jackson Heights only earlier this year and have witnessed them on more than one occasion. As opposed to the peeing South Asian woman who was witnessed (if the story is to be believed) precisely once. Beyond this one alleged incident, we have no idea who she is, what goes on in her life, what was going on that one day that prompted her to take such a drastic measure that may have greatly embarrassed her, etc. In all the other cultures listed in Birch-Edâ€™s post, the number of individuals who <em>are not</em> witnessed peeing in public (i.e., 100%) become indicative of their cultures (â€œâ€¦I can tell you that no woman from Germany, Ireland, Korean [sic], Japan or any Spanish country has lifted up her dress and urinated by a treeâ€, as if he could possibly know such a thing), whereas this one poor Desi woman in this one isolated incident must serve to represent not only her culture but a whole cluster of related cultures. I also donâ€™t appreciate words being placed in my mouth with statements being made (â€œSo let&#039;s stop beating around the bush and pinpoint the culprits who dirty our street.â€) as if we <em>all</em> think the South Asian cultures themselves are to blame but we are too polite to say so. Members (whatever their ethnic background) who use such obvious hate speech really need to be removed from the board.

				elyaqim, I see a bias but not what I&#039;d call hate speech. &nbsp;To me hate speech is, well, hateful. &nbsp; Some people who have lived here for over 20 years do see changes, both positive and negative, and feel they are absolutely part of cultural change.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak personally about what goes on in India or China or Japan or Germany etc. because I haven&#039;t travelled there but I can speak personally about living in different communities with different cultures in this country having moved around on both Coasts. &nbsp;For example: I lived for three years in the Lower East Side next to Chinatown. &nbsp;Chinese immigrants think nothing of pressing one nostril and blowing their nose on the sidewalk. &nbsp; As someone who was raised not to do that, I find it disgusting. &nbsp;To the Chinese community, it is normal and not disgusting. &nbsp;That&#039;s not hate speech. &nbsp;That&#039;s a cultural fact of life.<br /><br />I feel there is some truth to the comments about the Indian community and garbage. &nbsp;Look at the rest of 37th Avenue and you can see it is not as dirty. &nbsp;BUT it is not as clean as it once was either. So I personally wouldn&#039;t just single out the &quot;Indian community&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />I agree with other posters who remembered a time when merchants hosed off their sidewalks every day. &nbsp;That moment has gone I think with explosive population growth and congestion. &nbsp;Also attitudes have changed from a past where people knew their neighbors and wouldn&#039;t think of littering their property. &nbsp;With anonymity I think comes more thoughtless behaviour. &nbsp;I find it crosses all ages and backgrounds and isn&#039;t exclusive to a few blocks.<br /><br />They do get more foot traffic though what with the subway etc. &nbsp;And it is very dirty. &nbsp;AND THE MERCHANTS DO NOTHING ABOUT CLEANING UP THEIR SIDEWALK. EVER. &nbsp;<br /><br />one question elyaqim, you don&#039;t post here because you don&#039;t agree with someone&#039;s views - biased or not? &nbsp;Have you found sites where you agree with everyone? &nbsp;I&#039;d love to know their web addresses. &nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This thread has reached 6 pages, and been viewed over 500 times!&nbsp; Yet, the garbage is still there, it will still be there in a year, and ultimately nothing will be done!<br /><br />I think those pointing out the trash situation are doing a good deed, and fighting the â€œgood fightâ€, but you should simply point out the situation without making ANY reference to ethnicity/race.&nbsp; By doing so, you are falling into the trap of those wishing to find â€œracismâ€ hiding behind every lamp post in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The whole issue of race/ethnicity is one big red herring leading everyone off track so that in the end, nothing is done!&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are two pictures of â€œLittle Indiaâ€ in Singapore Iâ€™ve found on the web, an area Iâ€™ve been to several times on weekends, and have fond memories of.&nbsp; I think these pictures prove a â€œpointâ€ to those on both sides of this debate, but Iâ€™ll let your â€œlying eyesâ€ decide for yourself what the â€œpointâ€ is, rather then me provide any editorial comments:<br /><br />(http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Singapore_Little_India.jpg)<br /><br />(http://www.selketbauer.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/no-not-india-little-india.JPG)

				Not that this thread is really the place to discuss why I donâ€™t post here often, but it is because I occasionally feel uncomfortable and disrespected. It doesnâ€™t mean that any large number of members is expressing bigotry, merely that the continued and excused presence of bigots, however few there are, turns me off. I never said that <em>Jackson Heights Life</em> is the bigot board, just that I personally donâ€™t always feel comfortable, without making any extrapolations about how anyone else should feel. Putting a loud, brash Klansman in an intimate dinner party will make everyone feel uncomfortable and not want to participate, but it doesnâ€™t mean the majority of guests are racists. A small, vocal minority can make the majority feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />Also note the difference between the responses to Birch-Ed and the responses to me. The implication by John Prester that ethnicity should simply not be mentioned because, â€œBy doing so, you are falling into the trap of those wishing to find â€˜racismâ€™ hiding behind every lamp post in Jackson Heightsâ€ implies that I am seeking â€œracismâ€ (in quotation marks) that doesnâ€™t actually exist while Birch-Ed merely mentioned ethnicity which was nothing more than a faux pas that led him to fall into my trap. There is nothing wrong with race or ethnicity, so there is nothing wrong with mentioning it, just please recognize bigotry when you see it. And buddyâ€™s statement that I â€œdon&#039;t post here because you don&#039;t agree with someone&#039;s viewsâ€ is a bit of a trivialization; of course, there is no Web site where I agree with everyoneâ€™s views, but there is a world of difference between disagreement and bigotry. I enjoy and respect differences of opinion. Disagreement makes for some wonderful discussions, and I appreciate it. Making sweeping negative generalizations about ethnic groups based on litter on the street and witnessing a woman peeing in public is not mere disagreement.<br /><br />Maybe Iâ€™m just too sensitive, but Iâ€™m also surprised the handful of openly gay members have said nothing about the confusion in another thread between the prostitution problem on Roosevelt Avenue and the mere presence of transsexuals on the avenue. Again, the majority of members have been very respectful, but a member or two need to be told the problem is with prostitution, not with transsexuals.

				Well said.&nbsp; Speaking out when people attempt to assign collective guilt (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt#Collective_guilt) is not the same as &quot;wishing to find â€˜racismâ€™ hiding behind every lamp post.&quot;&nbsp; It is a necessary step for the preservation of free speech.<br /><br />Brian, Birch-Ed, and others -- I think it&#039;s safe to say that everybody on this board shares your frustration with the sanitation situation in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Some people on the board are even doing things in the real world about it.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, speaking only for myself, I feel that your insistence in tying this issue to ethnicity serves no public purpose, and in fact does more real and lasting damage to our community.&nbsp; I again urge you to put your energies toward finding ways to address the problem, rather than fostering division and anger.

				A couple points:<br /><br />1.)&nbsp; I don&#039;t see any &quot;continued and excused presence of bigots&quot; on this board.&nbsp; Snarky comments (I&#039;m guilty as charged!), heated debate, passionate arguments, but nothing really bigoted per se.&nbsp; A joker in this thread on gentrification posted how he&#039;s glad &quot;the Dutch are gone&quot;, but rather than call him a bigot or racist, I let my sarcasm speak for itself:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=581.msg4313#msg4313<br /><br />This quote from Helen Keller is appropriate:<br /><br /><em>Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.</em><br /><br />2.)&nbsp; <em>The implication by John Prester that ethnicity should simply not be mentioned because, â€œBy doing so, you are falling into the trap of those wishing to find â€˜racismâ€™ hiding behind every lamp post in Jackson Heightsâ€ implies that I am seeking â€œracismâ€ (in quotation marks) that doesnâ€™t actually exist while Birch-Ed merely mentioned ethnicity which was nothing more than a faux pas that led him to fall into my trap. </em> <br /><br />Sorry, it&#039;s not all about you, and the comment isn&#039;t even directed at you!&nbsp; <br /><br />See this thread here on &quot;Streetsblog&quot;, a discussion about a video shot by Will Sweeney (who&#039;s posted here a few times) and Kozo Okumura on the traffic problem in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Mr. Sweeney made no mention whatsoever about race or ethnicity, he simply posted his video.&nbsp; Yet scroll down to comment #18, and the discussion gets sidetracked with the usual accusations of &quot;racism&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know Mr. Sweeney personally, but I hardly think anyone who associates with someone with an obvious Japanese name has serious race issues.<br /><br />http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/08/03/saturday-evening-in-jackson-heights-queens-feel-the-pain/<br /><br />The point in pointing this web site out is simply to provide an additional &quot;Exhibit&quot;/&quot;Data Point&quot;/&quot;Anecdotal Evidence&quot; that these types of discussions get sidetracked on tangential issues that have no bearing on the main issue.&nbsp; The issue is simply trash on 74th Street (or traffic in the video), and suggestions for cleaning up the street.&nbsp; Read the &quot;Streetsblog&quot; comment thread and how the ensuing conversation simply devolves into incoherence and useless accusations, with the end result that nothing was done, and nothing will be done!<br /><br />3.)&nbsp; Lastly, we all can&#039;t &quot;pick and choose&quot; whom we want to believe or trust.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here we have skepticism expressed on one peson&#039;s &quot;eyewitness account&quot;:<br /><br /><em>As opposed to the peeing South Asian woman who was witnessed <strong>(if the story is to be believed)</strong> precisely once.</em><br /><br />Yet here we have comments expressed as fact:<br /><br /><em>but there are also a number of (Western-looking) individuals who sleep on the sidewalk near the same intersection sprawled out in such a way that pedestrians can barely pass.</em><br /><br />Who are we to believe?&nbsp; Birch-Ed or Elyaqim? Neither? Or both? <br /><br />Healthy skepticism should be applied to all, myself included.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Recently I went to Travers Park at 10:00 am, later than usual.&nbsp; The sprinkler wasn&#039;t on so I asked the Ranger if he could turn it on.&nbsp; He apologized (very kindly) and said that they had been cleaning up so much glass and garbage and it took a long time because it&#039;s only the two of them.&nbsp; I know there are community groups that clean the park and I appreciate them but I also think that we need for this to change, it shouldn&#039;t just be 5-10 kindhearted people cleaning up after everyone.&nbsp; As for the schools initiating a program to make our community better...I wouldn&#039;t count on it.&nbsp; I subbed in some neighborhood schools and most of the teachers are not from jh, same for the administrators.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what the answer is but usually I go to the park very early and more often than not it looks like a bomb exploded there. When I see it like that I feel really bad for the two men who clean up.&nbsp; It&#039;s not their fault it&#039;s so disgusting.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;My son who is 2 years old, goes around picking up garbage and throwing it in the can.&nbsp; Part of me cringes and wants him to stop and the other part is thinking... well, let&#039;s not go there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just feel really mad about it, I can&#039;t think of a good solution but I think we pay enough money in taxes to at least have a couple of rangers in the park to enforce the rules and make it a safe/happy/fun place to be.&nbsp;

				I do not dispute that there are different social norms in other countries, some of which lead to cleaner streets than ours, and some of which lead to dirtier streets than ours. &nbsp;However, I make the distinctly American demand that we treat all of our neighbors equally -- and not have special exceptions, explanations, or excuses for antisocial behavior within our own neighborhood based on ethnicity.<br /><br />Can we have a free, diverse society and clean streets? &nbsp;It&#039;s certainly a lot harder here than in countries where there is little diversity, or in countries where there is little liberty. &nbsp;The only solution as I see it is to put in the hard work as a community to create a new social norm. &nbsp;That means activating all of the various components of the community to participate in keeping it clean, including businesses, residents, enforcement agencies, community groups, etc. &nbsp;It requires putting in the time to meet with people face to face, and to communicate your seriousness of purpose while demonstrating that you respect the people you&#039;re meeting with. &nbsp;It really is hard work. &nbsp;And that it why I have tremendous admiration for our emerging community leaders who are putting in the time and effort. &nbsp;But every time somebody starts pointing at the supposed dirty habits of one or another ethnic group, or the neglectful behavior of one particular segment of the community, it makes it all that much harder to build the trust and working relationships they need to get this problem solved. &nbsp;People are forced into a defensive position, and the litter once again becomes somebody else&#039;s problem rather than a shared problem.<br /><br />I think the 73rd &amp; 74th Street situation can change rapidly when we have elected officials willing to provide leadership. &nbsp;Right now, neither our community board not our city councilwoman is willing to confront the issue. &nbsp;Part of the reason they find it so difficult is that the issue is being framed in terms of race and ethnicity, which makes it risky and infertile terrain for politicians to invest time and effort. &nbsp;I am optimistic that our current crop of candidates for City Council has a better understanding of how to address these issues, and a greater willingness to invest political capital in addressing them once in office. &nbsp;We need to hold their feet to the fire, but we also need to help them by developing ideas and communication channels.<br /><br />So, please, once again, can we discuss what can be done to begin addressing this problem? &nbsp;&#039;Cause I&#039;m really sick of hearing people whine about the dirty foreigners.<br /><br />

				having caught up on this thread finally, one thing&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed is that we&#039;re getting race and culture confused. There&#039;s a big difference between the two. An Inuit raised in Japan form an early age will very likely behave culturally like a Japanese person as opposed to what his / her race might otherwise dictate. Understanding the various cultures that exist in our neighborhood is the first step to solving the problem of litter in the street. Once we know why people behave in certain way we can better address, communicate, and educate. <br /><br />But, it&#039;s a lot harder to educate the masses then it is to deal with the commercial establishments on 73rd and 74th st. (there&#039;s certainly fewer businesses then there are people). Another complication is I&#039;m reasonably certain most of the people who patronize these businesses especially on the weekends do not live in or even near Jackson Heights (as evidenced by the license plates from NJ, PA ,CT). So a lot of these people don&#039;t see the impact of their dropping a coffee cup here or there etc. as they don&#039;t have to walk that way to work on Monday morning. <br /><br />82nd St. while busy and certainly not the perfect picture of cleanliness is still better off than 73rd and 74th streets partially because many of the people who use that street live in the area. Also, some years back 82nd St. was redesigned to allow for increased foot traffic, has more garbage cans, and the 82nd St. BID helps to keep the St. clean. I&#039;ve also noticed a higher police presence on the street. Why the difference ? My theory, the merchants on 82nd St. realized that they would lose local business if they didn&#039;t clean up their act, The merchants on 74th st. are not as affected by members of the local community since most of their business comes form outside the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Solutions ? <br /><br />Some coordinated effort on the part of the JH Community as whole that reaches out to the Jackson Heights Merchants Associationhttps://a069-webapps3.nyc.gov/dsial/Agency_Detail.aspx?id=216 (https://a069-webapps3.nyc.gov/dsial/Agency_Detail.aspx?id=216), and the Bangladeshi Merchants Association (Sorry no URL), with petitions, letters, meetings and constant conversations asking these groups to take better care of their streets. <br /><br />Step up and continue calls to 311 to report litter, vandalism, broken laws, etc. to the appropriate departments. <br /><br />Constant communication with local elected officials highlighting these problems. <br /><br />Scrutinize our local electeds and those running for office on their associations, donations and endorsements from groups or orgs. that do not contribute to the JH community in a positive way. <br /><br />And as a last resort, boycott businesses that do not care about the cleanliness of their streets. This may be a challenge as I mentioned above most of the patrons come from outside JH, but with effective education and a visible protest maybe it might help. <br /><br />In the end it comes down to money, the merchants on 73rd and 74th st. are not going to make any more money if their streets are clean, in fact they will lose money (as far as they are concerned) by investing in a BID.&nbsp; But if their political power can be lessened, and they wind up getting more fines from Sanitation, etc. they might soon decide it&#039;s cheaper to invest in a BID.<br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents.

				Aronan, I love when people give their &quot;two cents&quot; because I love the open dialogue.&nbsp; I have a question for you or anyone who wants to pipe in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have friends who always correct me when I use the word &quot;race&quot; to describe people because they say there&#039;s only one race: the human race.&nbsp; What do you think?<br /><br />And while people have brought up birds...&nbsp; does anyone know if people who throw food out all over private property every day for birds are breaking any laws?&nbsp; There&#039;s a lady who pushes a shopping cart every morning around 34th Ave. in the upper 80s and she throws seed, peanuts etc. EVERY WHERE.&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked her not to come and do it at our building and she hasn&#039;t but she does it right across the street and on the sidewalk etc.&nbsp; I know there are more important things in life to deal with but I do think it doesn&#039;t help when we&#039;re talking about cleaner streets.

				On a couple of posts it has been implied that I&#039;m a racist.&nbsp; FAR FROM IT!&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights since I was 7 years old and now I&#039;m 54.&nbsp; I grew up and went to school at St Joan of Arc with Irish, Italian, Greek, Spanish ( as I am ) and Chinese.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have always been around diversity in Jackson Heights. Someone mentioned that maybe I should help with the problem.&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; On numerous occasions I have written and visited Helen Sears along with many others. I have worked and assisted the Beautification Group removing&nbsp; graffiti and planting flowers in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just because I posted the countries where the individuals come from which come to our neighborhood to shop and throw litter on the ground, that does not make me a racist.&nbsp; I am more of a racist when people walk around with blinders on and talk the talk like politicians, soft soaping the issues.&nbsp; People who do that are adding to the problem, not the solution.&nbsp; &#039;Politically Correct&#039; has created more of a racist environment in this country and has made a mess of the children of this country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Children know they have the law behind them when parents want to smack them.&nbsp; Children killing children, a child burning his grandmother because she wouldn&#039;t let him go out, the stories continue every day.&nbsp; So to be Politically Correct,, we can&#039;t mention the country of origin that a group of people which come to our neighborhood and dirty it.&nbsp; &nbsp; That&#039;s garbage (no pun intended).<br /><br />When I found this site and read through some of the posts I saw many topics which are nice for people from the same neighborhood to talk about.&nbsp; Only a few topics that were about real issues.&nbsp; But they seemed kind of sugar coated.&nbsp; Now with this topic, we get into a discussion and someone turns into a racist topic which it&#039;s not.&nbsp; You need to take your blinders off and walk and see the issues.&nbsp; You really need to stop living in a dream land and look at reality.&nbsp; If not, then you should click your heals three times and wake up back in Kansas.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Someone mentioned the Petition, which I think is a great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;This website is free and can be used.&nbsp; http://www.gopetition.com/<br /><br />So in closing, I thought this site was to talk about everything Jackson Heights including really serious issues, but it seems more of a Jackson Heights Fan site.<br /><br />Todd...if you want to delete me, fine.

I see I am not the only one who bristled at the statements made. In real life as well as online, it seems people are more concerned with countering insinuations of bigotry than countering bigotry. I absolutely concur there is a distinction, as Andrew put it, between race and culture, but the particular posts on which I commented did not observe that distinction. Many wish to leap to the postsâ€™ defense by essentially saying many good and accurate things (â€œDifferent people coming from different cultures DO act differently.&nbsp; That is NOT RACISM.â€) that donâ€™t really address the initial problem of the original words of the specific posts which likely reveal something about the authorâ€™s beliefs. That my gripe about the bigoted tone of certain posts created more of a negative reaction than the original posts themselves is really telling. Many people donâ€™t notice bigotry when they see it, and thus are baffled when someone complains about it, and then conclude the complainer must just be upset an issue was brought up at all rather than that it was being addressed in a bigoted way. In other words, the initial provocative comments are seen as benign, and the reaction to it is seen as an inflammatory defamation of character. (â€œI am not a racist but a nice guy, because I do all these nice things and I am a good person who has friends of every colorâ€ rather than discussing the original words that prompted the response.) The nonsense about â€œSo to be Politically Correct,, we can&#039;t mention the country of origin that a group of people which come to our neighborhood and dirty it.â€ is very dismissive and seems a smokescreen to draw attention away from the initial bigotry by insinuating any response to it is by the thought police.

This has actually undone a lot of progress made in changing bigoted attitudes (as bigot can claim any offence taken at their views is &#039;political correctness gone mad), whilst making people feel guilty for enjoying anything but the blandest, most anaemic humour for fear of being &#039;offensive&#039;.

(Or &#039;The League of Gentlemen&#039; for the benefit of any Brits out there?) <br /><br />At the same time as straight white able-bodied men are going out of their way to talk about &#039;ethnic people&#039; (who ISN&#039;T ethnic!?) and those of &#039;different sexual orientation&#039;, there are blacks calling themselves niggas (which has been going on for years), gays calling themselves (and each other!) poof, queens and queers, and so on - the real way to neutralize a term used as&nbsp; an insult is for those to whom it was applied to use it themselves.<br /><br />AT its worst, political correctness is nothing different form Orwell&#039;s Newspeak - an attempt to change the way people think by forcibly changing the way they speak &lt;&lt;<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />I, personally, don&#039;t think Indians, Pakistanis, Asians are &quot;bad&quot; and German and other Europeans are &quot;good&quot;.&nbsp; That one group is &quot;dirty&quot; the other is &quot;clean&quot;.&nbsp; But I do think they, as people from different countries and cultures, ARE different in some ways.&nbsp; And I hate the fact that people have to pussyfoot around everyone&#039;s differences instead of just accepting that yes, people are different and behave different and think different in many ways.<br /><br />I bristle over that.<br /><br /><br />

Noticing that groups of people are different does not at all constitute racism or sexism. This does not mean bigotry does not exist, and <em>no one</em> was criticized merely for broaching the topic of ethnic differences. That some members cannot distinguish between merely discussing ethnic differences and expressing bigotry seems very bipolar: unable to visualize shades of gray, unable to discern there is anything between <em>a</em> and <em>z</em>, alpha and omega. It also feels like a right wingâ€“dominated discussion when the concept of bigotry is presumed not to exist and the perception of it is dismissed out of hand with rolling eyes as â€œpolitically correct.â€ This is the Twenty-First Century, and hatred is frequently covert.

				Buddy,&nbsp; you can do something simple that is not so exhausting to contribute to getting the neighborhood clean. Because of my schedule I can&#039;t get to the clean street events, but do regularly, as I&#039;m walking my dog, tear down signs that have been plastered on the lamp post as my contribution to making the neighborhood clean (A moving company is notorious for posting and evertime I see it I take them down). Despite calling the company and asking them not to do so, they continue to post. The next time a particularly egregious garbage event happens, I&#039;m going to post it here so that if anyone is incline to do so they&nbsp; can call 311 to report it.&nbsp; The same for posting on windshields on cars which causes litter everwhere. I&#039;d like to follow it through to see what the city does or does not do and then follow through with local politicians.&nbsp; I like the idea of having everyone call in since there is more power in numbers--and the onus is not on one person.

				This may have already been said but it seems to me that the street conditions in some sections of JH are a matter of compliance with the law and lax enforcement.&nbsp; I went to the Dept. of Sanitation website and pretty quickly found that it is the law in NYC that every business sweep in front of its establishment- actually extending 18 inches into the street- at the beginning and end of every day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why not simply ask all merchants in Jackson Heights to comply with the law?&nbsp; Check out the DOS rules for yourself here-&nbsp; http://home2.nyc.gov/html/dsny/downloads/pdf/rules/digest/digestprint.pdf .

				We all knew that.&nbsp; But the truth is that the merchants really don&#039;t follow the law.&nbsp; I often call the sanitation dept. and they don&#039;t respond right away either.&nbsp; And even if the merchants sweep in front of their store at the beginning and end of every day, still it will be not enough considering the indians/bagladeshes habit of littering.&nbsp; those streets are just chaotic state.&nbsp; And it is vicious cycle because more garbage make people less care about environment and they tend to litter more.&nbsp; And more garbage on streets indicate the street is less controlled and it attracts more crime and homeless people, too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why Community board or city council has not done anything about those streets.

				MY two cents on this controversial issue.&nbsp; 74th Street is one of the main gateways to our community and it is a disgrace.&nbsp; &nbsp;A friend of mine&#039;s boyfriend recently moved to JH on 74th Street and 34th Avenue.&nbsp; Her first visit here was in the early evening and it was almost her last.&nbsp; She couldn&#039;t believe the garbage and live vermin she saw.&nbsp; She told her BF she didn&#039;t want to walk on 74th street again and asked him to pick her up.<br /><br />I first came to JH in 1979 and used to frequent 74th Street but I now avoid it like the plague.&nbsp; After reading this thread several times I decided to visit 74th street a few times in the last two weeks to take a closer look and I believe it is worse than ever before.&nbsp; <br /><br />I feel that the South Asian business owners and their patrons deserve some criticism for the state of the street since they occupy almost all of the stores.&nbsp; In the late 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s before the street became predominately South Asian it was a busy commercial street but not the eyesore it is now.&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t believe much else changed except the store owners and their patrons.&nbsp; I know some people won&#039;t like my criticism but many others feel the same way.&nbsp; I&#039;m not picking on this particular community since I think many South Asians are probably disgusted by the street also.<br /><br />I remember in the late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s Bell Boulevard in Bayside became a hotbed of pubs and nightclubs.&nbsp; The neighborhood was up in arms about loud cars, loud drunken behavior out 4 AM and people urinating on the lawns.&nbsp; Most of these businesses were Irish owned and frequented by the Irish and other Caucasians.&nbsp; The community pressured the local politicians and bars to clean up the area and restrictions of the zoning laws were put in place to&nbsp; limit the number of bars.&nbsp; As an American who is of 50% Irish descent I didn&#039;t feel the complaints were racist but justified.<br /><br />I feel that many posters complaints here are also justified and not racist.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure others will strongly disagree but as someone with a longtime JH perspective I wanted to add my two cents.

				Eddie, I don&#039;t remember what that area was like when I moved here in 1987.&nbsp; I remember the neighborhood, as a whole, was not as nice as it is now.&nbsp; I also remember how hard a group of us worked to get merchants to conform their store fronts and signs to be in accordance with the Historic Status of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It was not easy.&nbsp; Back then the merchants that were ignoring the requests to work towards a prettier, cleaner community were mostly Hispanic.&nbsp; So we, a group of Board Presidents from over a half dozen Co-ops along with single family home owners, (some of whom were Hispanic themselves) singled out these merchants with violations to try and get them to follow the rules of living in a Historic District.&nbsp; The merchants said we were&nbsp; racist and they complained bitterly.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not easy getting people to change their ways.&nbsp; When we were called &quot;racists&quot;,&nbsp; we responded by saying: &#039;we don&#039;t care who you are, where you&#039;re from, what your background is: these are the rules -- follow them or we will shop in stores that do.&#039;&nbsp; And then little by little, changes were made.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can remember our meetings and talking about the stores.&nbsp; We honestly didn&#039;t know who some of the owners were.&nbsp; We only knew some of the store fronts looked like crap.&nbsp; And we wanted the main shopping avenue to look nicer. If many merchants could clean up and maintain their stores, why couldn&#039;t the rest?<br /><br />What&#039;s wrong with that?&nbsp; Why is that racist?&nbsp; If you&#039;re FILL IN THE BLANK and I say JOHN DOE you have violations and you&#039;re not fixing the problem so I&#039;m shopping elsewhere.... why is that racist?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it is.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure some of you will think it is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone has a responsibility to the community as a whole to uphold their end of being part of the community.&nbsp; Everyone.&nbsp; No matter where you&#039;re from, what sex you are, no matter your age.&nbsp; Everyone is part of the community and everyone should work towards making it better.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I wanted to add one thing I think is important: when we singled out the merchants who were in violation, we never mentioned anything about who they were etc... just that their stores were in violation.&nbsp; I think that&#039;s important because like I already mentioned, in some cases we didn&#039;t know who even owned these stores.<br /><br />That&#039;s one of the things I hate about the whole topic.&nbsp; Too often people use the &quot;race&quot; card when it isn&#039;t really true.&nbsp; Like Eddie said, the merchants in question can be from anywhere, &quot;get your act together&quot;.

				74th St. Pre 1987 was cleaner and less busy largely because it wasn&#039;t as developed as it is today. There were a couple of 1 &amp; 2 family houses on 74th closer to 37th Ave. that have since been torn down and replaced by commercial buildings. Several mid sized stores were chopped up in to smaller stores and every nook and cranny on the St. was filled with some one selling something. Even the tiny alley way between pizza boy and what used to be the Jackson Diner was turned in to a store !<br /><br />The transformation of 74th St. from local shopping street to international center for all things South Asian brought a flood of visitors and traffic from a whole host of places. The street can not adequately support all the activity it is currently getting, wider sidewalks, more garbage cans etc. would help to alleviate a great deal of the congestion and littering issues on the Street. Coupled with stronger enforcement of litter and parking laws, and a strong effort from every level of the community to keep an eye on the street. <br /><br />The problem with he tone of some of the posts here and some of the sentiments expressed by people who live in JH is they focus on the fact that the stores on 74th St. cater to a South Asian population and blame this population for the trash. The fact of the matter is, as Eddie pointed out in his example of the Irish pubs, the race or ethnicity of the commercial center that 74th st. has become has NOTHING to do with the problems the street is encountering. More people, regardless of race, more trash. <br /><br />Any public effort to get the store owners and patrons of 74th St. to take more responsibility for the cleanliness of the St. has to be pitched away from ethnicity to be successful. Saying you have to clean up this street because you are a South Asian Business owner will certainly be met with resentment. Educating and encouraging businesses to do their part from a communal perspective is easier to push. Ultimately as is the case with any business, sometimes you have to hit them where it hurts to get a message across, fines, and boycotts can work wonders.

				Aronan, I agree 100%.&nbsp; <br /><br />Brian, the best way to help make change is to focus on the issue: everyone would like cleaner streets.&nbsp; Don&#039;t focus on individual people (especially since those streets lead to the subway and it&#039;s not just people who live here walking thru these streets to the subway BUT people drive from other neighborhoods, park their cars, and then walk to the subway.<br /><br />Focus on the sanitation department emptying garbage pails more often and even putting more pails in place.&nbsp; And have a community minded message that everyone living here would like to live in a cleaner environment.&nbsp; Because even when you don&#039;t single people out by ethnicity, you can create a negative vibe (talking from experience).<br /><br />Talk about the garbage.&nbsp; Talk about ways to solve the problem.&nbsp; Talk about people as a community.&nbsp; Don&#039;t single out a group based on where they&#039;re from.&nbsp; You&#039;ll accomplish more that way.&nbsp; But it is a slow, time consuming process.<br /><br />I&#039;ve paid my dues living here.&nbsp; Next person!<br /><br />

				Buddy and Aronan -- Thank you for your thoughtful and insightful posts.&nbsp; I agree with the approach you are advocating: shop owners who are neglecting their responsibilities should be approached about the need for them to take action.&nbsp; The decisions about who to approach and how should be completely independent of the ethnicity of the shop owner or their customers.&nbsp; And it should reach beyond the boundaries of one ethnicity&#039;s shopping district, so that nobody feels targeted because of who they are.&nbsp; The keys to success are: (1) organization; (2) clarity about criteria and objectives (e.g. shop owners should be told specifically what is being asked of them); and (3) civility and respect.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anybody is planning to move ahead with this effort, I would recommend discussing it with the Western Jackson Heights Alliance or the Community Journal, since they have already initiated efforts to reach out to the merchants.&nbsp; They may have some good advice.<br /><br />Buddy, you write...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">why is that racist?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it is.&nbsp; But I&#039;m sure some of you will think it is.&nbsp; </span></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think this misreads the discussion we&#039;ve been having on this board.&nbsp; Several of us said it is harmful and counterproductive to demand cleaner streets while in the same breath generalizing about the ethnic groups of the people involved.&nbsp; Some people who insist on pushing an ethnicity-focused approach have leaned heavily on straw man arguments and other diverting tactics that have confused this issue.&nbsp; But nobody said it was racist to request that the shop owners do more to keep the street clean.

				i think it&#039;s time we all stop placing blame. the problem exists for whatever reason. it&#039;s about a simple lack of respect and laziness. every little wrapper adds up and i don&#039;t think people get that. i have often thought of buying some chalk and drawing thick arrows to all of the trash cans in the neighborhood. sorry, i know it&#039;s extreme, but i share in everyone&#039;s frustration.&nbsp; why don&#039;t we start saying something when we see someone litter??? i reached a breaking point last week when saw a gentleman on 37th ave. throw a cup on the ground. i actually said something i was so angry....

				I need to do more investigation on this, but I went past last night and I was surprised that there were only 2 garbage cans on the 74th street. and they are in the beginning of the block. I can&#039;t believe this. of course there&#039;s trash on the ground. its our fault. what do we have to do to get 4 more cans on the block. and what about those sanitation guys. i see them on the street picking up gum wrappers, that&#039;s pathetic compared to what they actually can be doing.

				I hate to be a downer, but I don&#039;t think hiring more people is giong to help the situation. people will constantly be throwing down paper, so picking up piece by piece won&#039;t matter. the solution has to be a way which will guide people to keep their own trash under control. I get afraid the only thing this solves is one person&#039;s job situation. I&#039;d be interested to see waht they actually do at the MLP.<br /><br />Next week I&#039;m filling out some forms at helen sears&#039; office to see waht i can do. we&#039;ll see what happens.

				Seems like the various elected officials are taking turns paying for the Doe Fund out of their slush funds.&nbsp; This time it is Helen Sears&#039; turn...<br /><br />Queens Gazette<br />Sears Welcomes DOE Fund To Jackson Heights (http://www.qgazette.com/news/2008/0820/political_page/025.html)<br />August 20, 2008<br /><br />Councilmember Helen Sears (D-Jackson Heights/Elmhurst) was joined by local business owners and area residents to formally welcome the &quot;men in blue&quot; of the Doe Fund&#039;s centerpiece Ready, Willing &amp; Able program to Jackson Heights. Sears was able to secure the funding necessary to bring the Doe Fund&#039;s well-known Community Improvement Project street cleaning services to Jackson Heights. The hours and areas of operation will be 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday, along 37th. Avenue between 70th. and 81st. Streets, along 37th. Road between 73rd. and 77th. Streets, and on 73rd. and 74th. Streets between Roosevelt and 37th. Avenues.&quot;The Doe Fund provides people in need the opportunity to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction, and criminal recidivism, while providing a much needed service to the community,&quot; said Sears. <br /><br />(http://www.qgazette.com/news/2008/0820/political_page/025p1_lg.jpg)

				FWIW, I walked through 74th yesterday afternoon from 37th Rd to 37th Ave &amp; found it very clean. I don&#039;t know whether it was just my timing &amp;/or the result of an organized clean-up effort but I saw only 3 pieces of litter: a small cardboard box, a crushed coffee cup &amp; a parking ticket. Regardless of the cause, let&#039;s hope that it stays that clean.

				Part of the problem is that trash baskets fill up way before they are scheduled to be emptied, and this is especially the case on weekends.&nbsp; Once filled to capacity the street becomes the recipient of the litter.&nbsp; Helen Sears recently received more discretionary funds, maybe some of this money could be used to increase the frequency of pickups.
