			&nbsp;I do think the numbers and the level of sickness don&#039;t warrant the restrictions with the current level of information available. But if this falls into the category of &quot;with an abundance of caution&quot; and certain decisions are made at this time that confuse us all, I&#039;ll go along. Everyone in my immediate and extended circle who has passed from Covid, or gotten really ill, has seen it progress very, very quickly so if this is the early response and it&#039;s tempered later, I&#039;m ok with that. But your point is taken here.

			 &quot;The financial markets have nothing to do with the news.&quot;<br /><br />The financial markets most certainly reacted to the news.&nbsp; Without question.&nbsp;

			It appears that current vaccines are less resistant to to Omicron variant. Today&#039;s report from South Africa says that the Omicron may be 3 times more likely to create breakthrough infections&nbsp; That is a cause for concern for public health officials and pharmaceutical companies that have been advocating the vaccines as the best solution for the pandemic. Investors who speculate on the market have to react on early news and public health officials may have to prepare alternative measures. It remains to be seen if this variant is more dangerous than others. So far it seems mild, but we&#039;ll need a few weeks to really judge its impact.

			Sorry, it seems I misunderstood the report from South Africa.&nbsp; It was referring to re-infections in particular, or people who had previously been infected, not vaccinated people.&nbsp; The study was not peer reviewed.&nbsp; <br /><br />CBS News has the story here: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/omicron-variant-covid-cases-reinfection-boosters-africa-vaccine-equity/

			The spread of the Omicron variant only underscores the failure of the major Western countries, the US above all, to develop a strategy for eliminating this deadly virus worldwide. Instead, we are told we must learn to &quot;live with COVID&quot;, i.e., to accept more than 1,000 people, 400,000 a year, dying from it, and no one knows how many contracting long Covid that will potentially affect them for the rest of their lives. If people in our neighborhood are still wearing masks outside, it is because they know so many people who died or were sickened by the virus. Please forgive them for not following your enlightened &quot;science&quot;.
