				Title: <strong>Feline Pine</strong><br />

				I just moved to JH, &amp; am looking to find where I can buy Feline Pine cat litter (that&#039;s the one made of pine wood pellets).&nbsp; Does anyone know where it is sold locally - &amp; if more than one location, which is cheaper?&nbsp; Petland Discount doesn&#039;t carry it.&nbsp; In Manhattan, I used to be able to get it in the supermarkets.<br /><br />On the subject of litter:&nbsp; Does anyone use Yesterday&#039;s News (the one made of newspaper)?&nbsp; If so, how is it - does your cat like it;&nbsp; does it get messy;&nbsp; does it absorb odor;&nbsp; how often do you have to change it;&nbsp; etc.?&nbsp; Feline Pine is great, but a little pricey - if Yesterday News is good, I might switch.<br /><br />Thanks for your input.

				If Coral on 74th and roosevelt doesn&#039;t carry it, they&#039;ll probably order it for you. They&#039;re very nice, and when we wanted a specific brand of food for our dog, they ordered it for us. They carry a lot of natural and homeopathic items.

				I&#039;ll second the recommendation for Coral on Roosevelt - they&#039;ve got a nice selection of foods (we prefer grain-free Wellness) and litters. Although I don&#039;t know about Feline Pine specifically (our cats hate it), they&#039;ll get it for you if they don&#039;t have it.

				Coral does carry both the pellets(which I don&#039;t like) and the clumping (which I do like).

				Thanks for the Coral recommendation - I stopped there after work today, &amp; you all are right.&nbsp; Their selection is surprisingly vast, they did have Feline Pine &amp; who I assume is the owner is sweet &amp; accommodating.<br /><br />I still would like to hear from anyone who uses Yesterday News (re it&#039;s effectiveness, cat-friendly, etc.) - I still am considering switching.&nbsp; However, Feline Pine is so &quot;clean&quot; &amp; natural (you would never know a cat lives in the apartment), it&#039;s probably worth the extra few dollars.
