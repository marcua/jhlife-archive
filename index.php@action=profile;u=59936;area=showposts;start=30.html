					My god, you are all absolutely hilarious. I don&#039;t fully understand how the fate of 34th Ave has become such a hot button topic when there are so many other issues that need to be dealt with, but here we are. In the mean time, the stack of drunks outside of the former Burger King on 82nd has grown from five to ten (great welcome to the neighborhood). I would gladly sign the petition if it included a plan to deal with larger issues that will have a much greater impact on the neighborhood.

					As both an immigrant and someone who grew up poor (I experienced food insecurity before it was a thing), I&#039;m not sure how being concerned for the safety of our community is anti-immigrant or anti-poor. As Alphabet person commented, being poor or being an immigrant does not excuse aggressive behavior, nor does it excuse a number of other issues that have been ongoing problems in the neighborhood long before the pandemic. I doubt that the pile on 82nd Street, or the collection on 35th Ave. were living their best lives before all of this.<br /><br />We need to stop using the pandemic as an excuse. It&#039;s just an easy way to explain away problems that we don&#039;t want to deal with. I&#039;m not saying that the pandemic didn&#039;t exacerbate certain problems (it did), but to use it as a catch all explanation in simply intellectually lazy at best. Ditto writing things off as anti-whatever.

Ditto for the situation on 82nd, and near the post office.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been finding a lot of needles outside of my building when I leave for work in the morning. A neighbor told me that she saw a junkie nodding off on a lamppost in the middle of the day. It seems that for whatever reason, my block has become a favorite for these people.<br /><br />There is also the ongoing issue with prostitution on 79th Street and Roosevelt, as well as the problem on 88th. We have illegal basement bars all over the place, attracting any number of assorted degenerates. Bars around here regularly have security guards patting people down (pre-COVID. Now they just have the illegal basement bars where everyone gets in), and not just on Roosevelt. You can see the same thing at a few places on 37th, as well as Northern, and you don&#039;t even need to go all the way to Junction either.<br /><br />So yes, where are our elected officials? What is the community board doing to address these things? How come the 115th does nothing when called, if they even show up? More importantly, why do we accept these things as a community?<br /><br />At any rate, let&#039;s get on to more important things: How do all of you feel about unicycles, stilts and pogo sticks being allowed on 34th Ave? I&#039;m for all three provided that the unicycles are in between 12.45 and 37.87317 inches tall, all of the stilt walkers have mauve pom-pons attached to their stilts and wear a Robin Hood hat, and all pogo sticks must be pink. I am completely against hippity-hops, kangaroo shoes, and people walking with stilts while wearing top hats. I would personally like to see weekly rabbit races on 34th, and a rabbit run installed in Travers Park.

					There&#039;s a lot of great ideas here, and I&#039;m glad that this has turned into a productive conversation. Ultimately, while I do enjoy taking a stroll down 34th, and feel that is a great benefit to the community since there is so little public space, I&#039;m ambivalent about allowing vendors. There are times when I&#039;m walking there and think to myself &quot;man I&#039;d really like an empanada&quot; but then I remember, as one person mentioned, that there are several excellent places on Northern or 37th where I could find one. In other words, the lack of vendors will not keep me from taking a brisk evening walk.<br /><br />Anyhoo, how do you all feel about the stack of drunks on 82nd Street, the increase in assaults, and the freak shows that like to shoot into windows?

Like I don&#039;t know... some freak show shooting into an apartment building, or the the increase assaults, or any number of other things that have a much greater impact on the quality of life in Jackson Heights.

Isn&#039;t that along the lines of &quot;kale salad&quot; places? And what is wrong with kale salad, anyway? We already have Just Made 4 U, a health food place that seems very popular--and not just with the gentrifier crowd. They have very good, and yes, healthy food tailored for people who don&#039;t want to eat or cannot eat the heavier, richer cuisines available in JH. They may even have kale smoothies, actually. I used to get their green smoothie and I don&#039;t recall if it was kale--but it was delicious. Ordered dinner from them tonight, in fact, as we often do. Do you consider them gentrifiers?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s my opinion. My opinion is that it won&#039;t be years and years...if ever... before Jackson Heights sees a, say, &quot;Beer and Cheese&quot; venue. A true marker of gentrification. Like in Astoria, for instance. Or Bushwick.<br /><br />NB *Other opinions may differ. Which falls under the definition of &quot;opinions&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The irrational fears of Jackson Heights gentrifying to the extent of Bushwick, are just that; irrational. I also agree with you that anything that is even remotely hip opening up here is years, if not decades off for a variety of reasons (although Terraza 7 does some wonderful and interesting things, and Freddy is extremely open to what he allows to happen there, it isn&#039;t really a destination for anyone who lives off of the 7 Line). Jackson Heights simply doesn&#039;t have a critical mass of artists working in the neighborhood for that to happen, nor is it convenient enough to Manhattan to be appealing to the people who work in more lucrative fields.<br /><br />If we could get a good butcher and fish store, I would be happy. And a solid bar (not fancy) that doesn&#039;t have wall to wall televisions, or extremely loud, would be a plus. The Ready Penny used to suit my needs before the pandemic, but it would be nice to have another option.

					I&#039;m always amazed by how much energy people expend bickering about 34th Avenue being open. If that energy were focused on, oh I don&#039;t know, the illegal night clubs, prostitution, the gang issues, the bands of constantly drunk men that harass women on 37th Ave and Roosevelt, the men that harass women on the street in general, people shooting up on the streets and in Travers Park, people getting shooty and stabby, the increase in muggings, open drug dealing, etc, etc. it may be that we could actually get something done about these things, which would have a far greater impact on our community.<br /><br />Honestly, I like that 34th Ave is open but there are more important things going on, many of which have been issues long before the pandemic. If it was closed down tomorrow, I would be fine with it if the situation with the issues above were improved. How is it that 34th Ave deserves so much more attention than the real problems facing this community? This is an honest question.

					The topic crime in the neighborhood, which extends far beyond Diversity Plaza, came up on the Jackson Heights 11372 Facebook group. I&#039;m happy to see that there are people in our community that are interested in doing something about it, as opposed to simply explaining it away. People offer some excellent suggestions.
