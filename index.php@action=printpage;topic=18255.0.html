				Can someone recommend a good tree service in Queens? A tree fell in my parent&#039;s house and they need to have it removed from their backyard.<br /><br />Thanks.

				We have used Carlos Hernandez. He removed a huge pine tree that was dying and invaded with bugs. He was very reasonable (I called way too many companies) He cleaned up nicely as well. He just recently removed my elderly neighbors rotting tree with no issues. I do not have his number (can&#039;t find his card) but went through my emails and found his email address. It is carlos123h@gmail.com
