				https://jacksonheightspost.com/jackson-heights-street-co-named-after-the-late-sen-jose-peralta<br /><br />Oct. 7, 2019 By Allie Griffin<br /><br />Dozens of community members and local elected officials joined together in Jackson Heights Sunday for a special street co-naming ceremony to remember the late State Senator José Peralta who passed away last fall.<br /><br />On Sunday, Oct. 6, 79th Street between 37th Avenue and 35th Avenue in Jackson Heights was co-named “State Senator José R. Peralta Way.” The ceremony brought together local officials, neighbors and the family and friends of Peralta, including his wife and children. <br /><br />City Council Member Daniel Dromm passed legislation to co-name the street in honor of Peralta. Dromm described Peralta as “a beloved civic leader and elected official who left an indelible mark on the community he served for many years.”<br /><br />Peralta made history by becoming the first Dominican-American elected to the New York Senate when he was voted into office in March 2010. He served Senate District 13 from 2010 until his death on Nov. 21, 2018 at 47 years of age. <br /><br />A photo of the late Sen. Jose Peralta at Sunday’s ceremony (City Council Twitter)<br /><br />Peralta was most known for his support of undocumented immigrants, specifically young people who he believed deserved equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.<br /><br />In 2013, he introduced the New York State DREAM Act and built support for the bill in following years. It was passed and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this year and was renamed the José Peralta New York State DREAM Act after his death. Undocumented children, who are students in New York schools, now have access to state aid for higher education.<br /><br />The late senator’s tenure was also marked by a focus on immigration justice, support for working class families, access to quality education for all children and advocacy for LGBT rights. <br /><br />Prior to his service in the State Senate, Peralta served in the State Assembly from 2002 to 2010. He was a member of the New York Senate Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian caucuses, and of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Task Force.&nbsp; <br /><br />“New York political history will remember Peralta as a legislator of principled advocacy and genuine kindness,” Dromm said. “The Peralta family looks forward to watching his legacy live on through every civic-minded young person inspired to serve their community and fight for a more just America.”

				All the best to Peralta&#039;s friends and family, but I don&#039;t really like the renaming of streets/landmarks/ bridges after random people-of-the-moment.&nbsp; Particularly when those people are politicians (or corporations).<br /><br />I miss the Tri-borough, and the Queensborogh, and the Tappan-Zee (et al).&nbsp; I dunno, maybe I&#039;m just old fashioned.

				i agree completely about landmarks like those bridges, and i still use the &quot;real&quot; names (and so has every cab/car service driver i&#039;ve ever used). corners/partial streets, i&#039;m pretty much okay with.

				&nbsp;Regardless of your political persuasion, this is a lovely tribute to the Peralta family. It&#039;s great to see<br />that this name recognition lives on as he is gone way to soon. Nice of Sen. Ramos to be involved in<br />the honor as they certainly had their differences but that is not what this naming was about.

				Nobody has to use a memorial corner name; it doesn&#039;t inconvenience anyone. It&#039;s a nice little tribute.

				I&#039;m with Buzz.&nbsp; Yes, he served.&nbsp; And I have hear that he served the community well.&nbsp; But he was also voted out because after the last election, he decided to caucus with the Republicans and give them control over the Senate in Albany.&nbsp; I have mixed emotions about this.<br /><br />And yes, I still say Triboro, although I no longer call the Interboro that;&nbsp; I like the name Jackie Robinson Pkwy.

No they didn&#039;t. The word caucus has a meaning, and your usage of it is incorrect. A caucus is a meeting. It is also a group of people who belong to a particular body or faction. The IDC members did not meet with the Republicans. They met with other IDC members (a caucus) and voted for their own leader to head the Senate. They did not change their party registration. The leader of the IDC met with the leader of the Republicans (their own separate caucus). The other faction (caucus) was the mainline Democrats.&nbsp; The end result was control of the Senate by the minority party yes, but it is incorrect to say Peralta caucused with the Republicans.
