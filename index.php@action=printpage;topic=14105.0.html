				Hi neighbors, <br /><br />I&#039;m doing a project on Jackson Heights food culture for school. The project will be a map which shows the diversity of food and culture in our beautiful neighborhood. Does anybody have recommendations for favorite food spots they would like to be included? Eventually this will turn into a blog which tells the stories of local business owners (hopefully!!). Thanks in advance for any thoughts!

I don&#039;t always want Saw Shack&#039;s style - indeed, don&#039;t always want the obvious healthiness of its food - but the quality, for the price, is in my view unbeatable in our neighborhood.

				I really don&#039;t think Jackson Heights food is over-hyped. Sure, some of the best food in my opinion is next door in Elmhurst. But we still have some pretty terrific choices right in the neighborhood as well. <br /><br />When it comes to food hype I see a lot more surrounding the Brooklyn farm-to-table scene than anything in Queens.&nbsp; And I would avoid disparaging a fellow neighborhood chef, especially before your restaurant is even open.

Eventually, it will happen, but it hasn&#039;t happened yet.<br /><br />As for my views on Arrepa Lady, I consider her to be a media phenomenon, hyped by marketers, who makes unhealthy, unappetizing, greasy crepes. I certainly don&#039;t consider her to be a chef.<br /><br />And by the way, I started my comments with some pretty high praise for Saw Shack. <br /><br />

				Hi HFM,<br /><br />Sorry that you think it is a &quot;bad move&quot; for me to suggest that Arrepa Lady is about media hype and that what she is selling is unhealthy, greasy, junk food, and a third rate version of a good crepe, which is what it is. <br /><br />I was responding to the original question, and strongly recommended Saw Shack, with which you may or may not agree, serves much better food.<br /><br />P.S.

I am under the impression that the whole trend is toward no tablecloths, which has two consequences:&nbsp; much lower laundry costs for the restaurant, and more noise while one is eating, unless the establishment spends a lot of money on sound absorption.

I will take Arepa Lady over Saw Shack any day, especially when we have much better Chinese offerings in Elmhurst. I have tried Saw Shack twice and it served me nothing but &quot;unhealthy, greasy, junk food, and a third rate version of&quot; American-Chinese food. We may have different standards on these completely different cuisines.<br /><br />About your comment on chef, I am curious to know your opinion on Casa Del Chef. Though the restaurant is in Woodside, chef Alfonso Zhicay comes from Ecuador and adds some Ecuadorean elements into many dishes of his tasting menu (at least when I visited a few months ago.)<br /><br />Btw, I think @jaynahjosselyn has a very good school project that shows not only the diversity of food culture around here but also the diversity of opinions :)

				I finally tried Aroma Brazil and it is now one of my favorite S.

				jaynahjosselyn,<br /><br />Sounds like a great and fun school project. I wish when I was growing up on Long Island, I could have had such a diverse and interesting mix of cultures, especially when it comes to the food, around me to be able to complete a project like this which out having to take the train an hour into NYC. <br /><br />And before this topic goes down the hole that so many discussions on this site does with bickering, I wanted to point out a great article regarding a great ambassador of Queens food, Joe DiStefano, from the WSJ this weekend. He may be a great resource for your project. http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ambassador-of-a-foodie-haven-1449274994<br />

				An arepa is not a crepe and I don&#039;t understand why they are being compared.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s not exactly healthy, but it&#039;s not for every day eating. And it&#039;s no less healthy than the goose-fat laden, sodium-heavy dishes found in French restaurants.

				Stew, I&#039;m genuinely excited about your restaurant, but you should really have someone more diplomatic handling your social media, and possibly your dealings with the community board. I get that you&#039;re frustrated, but putting down others is not a way to get ahead. Whether you&#039;ve intended to or not, you&#039;ve been alienating allies left and right.

Many others and I, including those from out of town and friends who have not been to JH before love the food, the space, the service and the reasonable prices. As another poster said, its not meant to be a health food paradise by any means. <br /><br />Your posts have constantly come off as arrogant and condescending ever since you began touting your restaurant. Great way to gain rapport with the vast majority of the neighborhood. Perhaps you should cut your losses and try to open up in Brooklyn or some other gentrified part of NYC. I for one, will tell anyone who is curious about it how pompous, egotistic and patronizing you have been throughout. <br /><br />People like you are what are ruining this city one snooty artisanal overpriced cafe or bistro at a time. This is one of the few remaining neighborhoods in NYC that still retains an authentic feel. Good for the community board to stall your gentrification project.

				Madalyn, Stew called the food served at another Jackson Heights restaurant &quot;garbage.&quot;. He then said the &quot; over-hyped&quot; restaurants of our community serve &quot;cheap meat and cheap starches on even cheaper plates.&quot;. <br />That&#039;s hardly a &quot; mild &quot; disagreement.&nbsp;

				Absolutely not. Who would invest the time and money he has and expect to fail? Stew is a top-notch chef and often people in that profession are quirky and highly opinionated. Once his place opens and is a real &quot;value-added&quot; to the neighborhood, as I predict it will be, all this will pass. Yes, he should spend less time on this forum. But quality trumps all.

The entire time he has been condescending and this was the straw that broke the camel&#039;s back. <br /><br />Spewing negativity about places in the very same neighborhood you are opening a restaurant in is no way to gain rapport with the community, especially in a thread that has nothing to do with your place. <br /><br />It is not insignificant in the slightest. Demeaning potential customers by saying &quot;perhaps you should eat somewhere else&quot; and attacking restaurants that they may enjoy is not a smart way to build support. It sounds absurd as I type this, as restaurants are generally unsuccessful and you are already wiping out business before you had the chance to show what your place is all about, not to mention the word of mouth that already has and will spread. It is truly BAFFLING. <br /><br />If he had approached his venture from the start in a positive way by showing some humility and not bashing establishments that many have come to know and enjoy, this would not be an issue.

				EastsideJH, a question,<br /><br />When Jackson Heights residents go out for dinner, lots of them go to Manhattan, Brooklyn, Astoria, Long Island City, etc. <br /><br />Doing so costs time and, if they take a taxi (even one way), quite a lot of money.

				Hi Sonngodd,<br /><br />I have no doubt that Jackson Heights East Indian restaurants offer food that is &quot;home style&quot; and that Latin restaurants, including the one owned by your friend&#039;s family, are &quot;authentic&quot;.<br /><br />That is the problem.<br /><br />These restaurants are being run by people who are not trained as chefs and whose food is at least 20 years out of date. There are exciting things going on in East Indian and South American cuisine, none of which is reflected in East Indian and South Anerican restaurants in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />For example, there is an extremely important Peruvian chef (apart from Nobu) who is having a major influence in Latin Anerica and Europe, but whose influence in Jackson Heights is to this minute non-existent. Latin food in Jackson Heights continues to be starch, cheap meat and/or cheap frozen seafood from Thailand caught by people living in what amount to slavery conditions. But hey, if you want cheap food, that&#039;s what it takes. <br /><br />Cheers

Maybe owners of restaurants in this neighborhood who you trashed? Family members of these owners or others who work there? <br /><br />Your posts are a great case study of what NOT to do when using a message board to discuss the opening of your restaurant.

				Hi EastsideJH,<br /><br />On the contrary, you and your friends have just given me an opportunity to say something important about the seafood that is sold by the restaurants in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The seafood does not come from the U.S. or Canada. It mostly comes, frozen, from Thailand, and it is well documented that the fishermen who catch it are living in slavery conditions. The principal companies involved in this trade have admitted that there is a &quot;problem&quot; and have undertaken to stop sourcing their seafood from slavery operations.<br /><br />I think that it is important for all of us to know that the main reason that seafood dishes in Jackson Heighrs are cheap is that the seafood comes from Asia (instead of the island on the ocean where we live) caught by 14 year old boys who are being exploited.<br /><br />Think about that next time you order your favorite Asian seafood from your favorite Jackson Heights restaurant.

However you can have raw talent as a cook and make traditional foods that have been passed from one generation to the next.&nbsp; It may not be 21st century or artistally exciting, but tasty and nourishing, and an enjoyable experience.&nbsp; <br />Or the approach can be a combination.<br />&nbsp;I also don&#039;t go for food because it&#039;s cheap unless it&#039;s good and not overly unhealthy<br /><br />As per your thoughts about sweatshop food, it&#039;s very difficult to purchase anything anymore made by slave labor as much as we try to avoid it<br />

				Dont be surprised by the greed of others, just because the place looks or is&nbsp; expensive, doesn&#039;t mean that they don&#039;t cut corners to make a profit.&nbsp; The hall of shame comes in many forms. im always amazed when there is an expose or two on some place that was exploiting others in some way, no one would&#039;ve guessed.<br />&nbsp;if you have a specific article on how restaurants in jh has have been sited on using sweatshop fish it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; i for one try to avoid anything that has to do with child or slave labor. <br />i also don&#039;t eat much seafood in restaurants because im leery of it no matter where i go.<br /><br />

				Although I&#039;m no steward of this community website, it is in the rules to keep things on topic. Amongst other rules, some I had no clue about. Did you know you&#039;re not supposed to quote another poster except in a private message?&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I think the three most public restaurants, as in best-known outside of this neighborhood, would be Jackson Diner, Pio&nbsp; Pio, and the arepa lady.&nbsp; I believe all have their merits, though one can argue that others are more deserving of prominence. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;d be curious to hear what others think are the hidden gems of the neighborhood. I know I keep hearing about this secret&nbsp; noodle house in the back of another establishment that I have yet to check out. <br /><br />&nbsp;Then there is that Tibetan restaurant on Roosevelt (Gangjong Kitchen?) whose owner opened up a bigger joint&nbsp; in Sunnyside. Is that place still worth checking out or has it declined/lost its unique appeal since the owner has probably focus more of his energy on the new business?
