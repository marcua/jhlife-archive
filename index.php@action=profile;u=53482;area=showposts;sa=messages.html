					Thanks, Matt. <br /><br />I thought the BID was from 81st to 104th on Roosevelt and 37th. I hope the fact that JH is unfortunately divided between 2 council districts won&#039;t negatively impact the eventual creation of a true JH BID.

					Just curious - signs in the windows about no more donations - anyone know if they are going to reopen? <br />You could get some cool and unusual pieces there at good prices. I used to like looking through what they have and now that Spring has finally sprung, I&#039;m thinking I need pick up some new bits to add the mix here.

					There are still co-ops out there for sale, but as has been said, they don&#039;t get posted on JHL. Seems like JVH has taken over the postings and just saturates - and not everything is even in JH. <br />I&#039;d much rather be saturated by Addictive Boutique Wine and&nbsp; be surrounded by empty wine bottles! <br /><br />I remember at one time, most if not all of the sales in JH were with local brokers - the big guys like Corcoran, Halstead and Elliman didn&#039;t bother with us, and if they did, it was rare. There&#039;s still a couple of local brokers selling but as I&#039;ve been looking over the last year or so, there are far more big brokers than ever before. There used to be this great site - natefind.com - you could just type in a neighborhood or street and it would bring up every single home for sale matching your criteria for all brokers. I will say one thing I have noticed with the big brokers in JH, the prices seem more uniform and realistic. There&#039;s one broker in JH who, in my opinion, always lists properties for far more than they could sell for. I would love to know what they actually sell for. <br /><br />Now where&#039;s that wine...

					I know this is an older thread, but if I&#039;m reading it correctly, the current configuration of the BID includes Corona?&nbsp; I&#039;m not understanding why that is. I&#039;m sure the residents of Corona want nicer storefronts and all that too, but honestly, the clientele, incomes and needs in Jackson Heights and Corona are very different. I would think the Jackson Heights BID would focus on 37th and Roosevelt Avenues between 88th Street and 74th Street (give or take either way) and 82nd Street from Roosevelt to 37th Avenue. I like the uniform signage and awnings that a lot of the stores have now and that so many stores &quot;adopt&quot; the trees and plant flowers. Personally, I would like more of that in the historic district. If the historic district gets expanded, then the BID can worry about those areas, but for now, for my money, I would think it would be smarter to focus on these areas first. Anyone know why Corona and western JH is included in the BID?

					I&#039;ve been having problems with TWC internet and phone on and off the last week or two, most recently Saturday afternoon. When I called Saturday, I went through the whole rigmarole about checking the cables were connected tightly and not loose (despite the fact I never touched them, told her, and still had TV...) then I was told it must be my box so an appointment was needed (WHAT?) at that point I asked her to check with dispatch to make sure there wasn&#039;t an outage they hadn&#039;t posted yet (not my first time at this rodeo). She had a bit of an attitude over that, but guess what? She came back on and sure enough, she was told by dispatch there were &quot;rolling outages&quot; in my area. This matched with my problems as I could be on the phone, then it would drop, no dial tone - check a few minutes later, dial tone; another few minutes none. It was all back on by 10PM Saturday night. <br /><br />I&#039;m on 35th Ave in the low 70&#039;s and as has been posted here I would take FiOS in a heartbeat! I used to work from home more frequently, but the internet access and phone issues are problematic.

					Eddie, I know making a success out of just a bookstore or just a cobbler/shoe repair shop would be challenging to say the least. But I do think there are ways. The bookstore for example can be multipurpose - a cafe, bookstore, craft store, international newsagent or some combo like that is something I think could work. As for the cobbler, I guess I&#039;m just nostalgic for the days when there were a couple of options in the neighborhood, usually run by older European immigrants - which probably explains why they&#039;re not around anymore, they&#039;ve retired. It is just a pain to schlep my shoes with me in the AM to the city to drop them in at one of the 3 cobblers in spitting distance from my office; I&#039;d much prefer to keep it local. <br /><br />Grabey, Bailey, dssjh - I&#039;m drawing a blank on a Russian store on 37th and 79th? Is this guy just a shoe repair shop or something else too? I&#039;m glad to read your good reviews and find a cobbler in the neighborhood!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I&#039;m still holding out hope that JH will get a real gym -fingers crossed- maybe the Bruson won&#039;t be a tear down and an enterprising franchisee will take over the Plaza&#039;s space! Hope springs eternal and all that...

I guess you cannot fault these fellows for building and marketing to a specific demographic. I just hope this isn&#039;t a harbinger of what to expect with any other new construction - conforms on the outside to the area/historic district, but the inside is crap. Fingers crossed we won&#039;t see this or similar where the Bruson Building currently stands. <br /><br />

					For my money, I&#039;d like to see the following open in JH:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; A bookstore - a real honest-to-goodness bookstore, new and used, where you could get lost in the stacks. Someplace that has good selections - children&#039;s, fiction, non-fiction, local, indy press, foreign language books, etc.. Would be nice if they carried foreign magazines and papers too -- there&#039;s enough immigrants in the neighborhood I would think for that. <br /><br />2. A good shoe repair shop - if there is one, I don&#039;t know about it. <br /><br />3. A nice bar/pub. Yes, we have Pat&#039;s Ready Penny and Legend&#039;s which are good clean divey bars, but a nice one like some down in Woodside, Sunnyside and Astoria would be appreciated. <br /><br />4. A gym - a real one, one of the good chains hopefully. While I&#039;d love an Equinox, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s realistic, so maybe a NYSC? <br /><br />What I DON&#039;T want to see any more of are more 99 Cent Stores, more discount furniture stores, more banks, more chain drug stores. I wish we had a strong BID that could work with our local elected officials and landlords to entice more independent business owners to JH.

					I actually don&#039;t think they purposefully took down the notices in the elevators - the one notice was still up in my lobby, why leave that? I thought myself that it may be a general &quot;no postings in the elevator&quot; type of rule, previous buildings I have lived in had the same rule. But, like you EricaS, I sometimes give too much credit...<br /><br />As for who pays for lawyers and engineers - any tenants happen to be lawyers or engineers? You&#039;re right EricaS, they don&#039;t come cheap. Maybe a call to Danny Dromm for some guidance would be in order - are there lawyers or engineers who offer this kind of work pro-bono to tenants associations? <br /><br />How about any posters on here who lived through this (or are living through this) - any advice? <br /><br />Whatever the case, I agree - I&#039;m sure the sponsor/owner won&#039;t be paying -- it would be down to the TA to pay or get the services pro-bono. <br /><br />I have a number of questions too - I&#039;ll post them here since there have been a ton of conversions in JH up and down 35th Avenue in the last 20 years (and more) maybe some posters who have first hand knowledge of the process can give us here some insight!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />1. Why convert to a co-op vs. a condo? Are there any benefits or downsides to the sponsor and/or tenants going with one over the other? I know the overwhelming majority of buildings in JH went co-op, but some on conversion did go condo (The Delano, The Colton). More recently, The Carlton on 85th went co-op while Stratford Hall on 35th and 80th went condo.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, normally co-ops have a cheaper buy-in but higher monthlies, while the opposite is true in a condo. But that&#039;s about all I know - anyone have any insight? <br /><br />2. How many seats does the sponsor retain on the Board and how do they lose them as more units are sold? I ask this as I have a friend who lived in a converted co-op a few blocks up on 35th where the sponsor held the majority of the seats for quite some time, meaning they could (and did) block a number of things the board/owners wanted to do with the co-op, determined which contractors got the jobs, which management company they employed, etc., and it was only recently (within the last 5 years) the owners made the majority on that board. Something to think about. <br /><br />3. Can current tenants get out of their leases and get the insider prices if they want to purchase one of the vacant apartments on conversion? Maybe the tenant wants a better view, a quieter apartment, a bigger apartment, etc.. How about later on as tenants opt to move and more sponsor units go up for sale? <br /><br />4. House Rules - if the current owners have been letting certain rules slide and not enforcing them (i.e.; cats, carpeting, etc.) since the co-op is technically a new owner, could non-compliance with these house rules be used as a reason not to renew leases? <br /><br />5. Engineers Report - I was a bit unnerved by how often he used the term &quot;fair&quot; (windows, roof) and &quot;acceptable&quot; (elevators, window sills, skylights) in the report versus &quot;good&quot; when describing their condition. I also thought they were pretty vague on any pointing needs. These are all big ticket items and since the building is sold &quot;As Is&quot; it would fall to the co-op owners to pay for replacements/repairs. From my friends in the neighborhood, I know assessments to cover new windows or elevators can be $300 or so a month, on top on maintenance and mortgage payments. My last apartment I was subletting from a non-occuping owner - his maintenance was about $720 a month, my rent gave him double that - which covered his mortgage and gave him a few bucks too. The building had an assessment for pointing/roof repairs for a year and for that year, he made no money off my rent - I actually think he may have been slightly in the red. Imagine? Also, when co-ops need an influx of cash in cases like this, this is when they look to get rid of tenants in favor of buyers. <br /><br />6. The Vacant Apartments - as they are owned by the sponsor, will they be counted towards the 15% needed to convert? If I counted correctly, there are 24 vacant apartments in WP so something to consider. That makes it so much easier to reach the 15%, right? <br /><br />As for the basement access after 8PM, I figured it was a safety issue, which I totally understand and concur with. However, I would hope some compromise could be had - perhaps locking the outside doors at 8PM but allowing the elevators to go down to the basement until the doormen go off duty to give tenants access to laundry. Just my two cents on this issue. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping some other JH posters who have experience with this whole conversion process will post -- or maybe we need a new thread asking for their help and insight?<br />

					I don&#039;t know if I was in a fog or what the other morning, but I did see the notices for the tenant meeting in the lobby and elevator when I got home (and knew to look for them). As of today, no notice in the elevator in my building at least. <br /><br />Just an aside, there is a &quot;Washington Plaza Tenants Association&quot;? I never knew! <br /><br />I add to the chorus of the shower temps in the thread! Does anyone else have the problem of the noisy pipes when the shower runs? I always feel bad if I&#039;m up early and showering - like I might be waking one of my neighbors. But I have to say my biggest pet peeve is the basement/elevator shutting down at 8PM (sometimes earlier). I used to live in an apt a couple of blocks away that had the same rule, which as all you worker bees know, bites when the laundry is in the basement, you need clothes, you get home from work 7 or later and don&#039;t want to spend the weekend waiting around the laundry room for free machines. They did eventually lift the 8PM cutoff, but alas, my time was up and I moved here. I&#039;m thinking because the basement here connects all the buildings and has all those nocks and crannies, it is no doubt a security issue, which I understand. Maybe with some new security cameras installed in the basement, they could keep it open at least until the doorman goes off each night? Hope springs eternal. <br /><br />I keep going back and forth on this - leaning towards buying, then leaning to stay as a tenant. I was hoping the meeting on Monday would give some more information like you EricaS, but after seeing the notice, I&#039;m thinking this is a meeting by the WPTA and won&#039;t have a rep from the sponsors. But we&#039;ll see.

					It is unfortunate, but 37th Avenue has had a history of fires that gut entire blocks. I can remember back in maybe 1983 (?) when the whole block btwn 89th and 90th went up in flames. Then in 1987, the block where A&amp;C Plaza is now. Fast forward to 200? when the block btwn 84th and 83rd went up and now the Bruson Bldg. I&#039;m not casting aspersions on anyone here, just lamenting the loss of good mom n&#039; pop type neighborhood businesses which haven&#039;t come back. I would also wager most of the businesses under the Bruson Bldg won&#039;t be back either.

					I&#039;m with you Lilybell - got the prospectus last night and spent a good part of the evening going through it. It is a non-eviction conversion, thankfully. From what I&#039;ve been able to find out, according to the NYS Attorney General&#039;s office, under a non-eviction conversion plan an outside purchaser or the sponsor of an occupied apartment may not evict you. You may continue in occupancy as a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled tenant, paying rent to the outside purchaser or the sponsor, who must provide all the services required under applicable laws. I do believe all the apts in Washington Plaza are either RS or RC. However, the tenant of course has to abide by all the terms of the lease -- even those that you may have been told are &quot;unenforced&quot;. For example, when I moved in the super did tell me that while required to have X% of the apt carpeted, my neighbor downstairs was &quot;good&quot; so I shouldn&#039;t have any problems if I keep the hardwood. He was right - I kept the hardwood and haven&#039;t had any problems. Technically, this could be used as an excuse to not renew the lease, should the sponsor want to. So, if you want to stay as a renter, go through your lease and make sure you understand every term and that you as the tenant are abiding by every single one - don&#039;t give them any reason to not renew. Also, document everything - receipts for carpeting, air conditioner brackets, etc. as well as pictures of any damages from leaks, water, etc., broken appliances and the like and maintain a log of when you notified management of the damage and/or broken appliance. Make sure you return all those annoying forms the management has to send out about window guards, asbestos, etc. on time. We&#039;re supposed to be having new water supply pipes installed where they will need access to our apts in the coming month or two, you can be sure I will make sure there is carpet down by then and that the place is in pristine condition - again, the name of the game is to not give anyone any reason to not renew. <br /><br />Having said all this, I was looking at the prices and I actually didn&#039;t think they were that bad. To be honest, I thought Washington Plaza was a co-op before I moved in because unlike too many rental buildings in the neighborhood, this place is extremely well kept inside and out. My &quot;dream apt&quot; to buy would have been in the Chateau, or the Elm Court, or the Hawthorne Court - but honestly, having friends in all three buildings, they are not all they&#039;re cracked up to be. They have fireplaces - which I love - but those big interior gardens? You can&#039;t go on the grass, lay out, let kids play, etc.. Some of the buildings in the Chateau and the Courts lock the front door to the lobby at 8 or 9PM (the apt bells are in the little vestibule) -- so anyone visiting or delivering to you after has to call you and you have to go down to let them in - hope this has changed, as it makes no sense. As all those buildings are self managed per address (i.e.; each entrance is its own co-op, it is not one big co-op) the boards are picky both in who they let in, what they require and in the house rules too. Also, some apt layouts are kind of boxy whereas others are nice and airy. And, with only 12 or so apts in the co-op, not only can assessments be steep, but everyone knows your business. So other than the interior gardens you really can&#039;t use and the fireplaces, what is the difference to here? Historic District? I believe there are plans in the works to expand it (someone on JHBG may know more?) which would encompass WP. <br /><br />So, and this is just on one night&#039;s thoughts, if the plan gets accepted, I would definitely think about buying here in WP. <br /><br />I have lived in Manhattan and in JH and I can tell you, this is the largest 1 bedroom apt I have ever had. The closet space alone would have be convinced to buy! LOL Aside from the large size of the apts here, the staff are fantastic, as I said, the building and gardens are so well kept and I&#039;ve never (knock wood) had any problems with neighbors or the management company. Rare combinations in JH or anywhere in the city for that matter. While I don&#039;t think the proposed pricing and monthlies are out of this world, I do think there has to be some wiggle room too. From what I understand from others buying into conversions or converted co-ops, mortgage lenders have issues when it is not a majority owner-occupied co-op. I would guess the sponsor would know this (as would any realtors on here?) and I would think would be willing to work with you. I&#039;m not saying they&#039;ll drop tens of thousands off the price, but they should be able to work with you I would think. For me, I am wondering if a tenant can buy another apt in the building that is empty under this offering? For example, I&#039;m a one bedroom, I&#039;d like a 2 bedroom. I saw in the prospectus there are a number of 2 bedrooms vacant under the plan -- could I buy one at the insider price? If so, what does that do to my lease? Would the sponsor work with me and let me out of my lease? Just wondering as ideally, if this goes through and if they would work with me, that is what I would think to do. <br /><br />Anyway, it is still early days - I&#039;d say we have a good 6 or so months before we hear anything about this. I see you said 80% of tenants need to agree to buy for this plan to go through, Lilybell - where did you see that? I read 15% of tenants need to agree to buy for the sponsor to enact the plan. Where did you hear about the tenant meeting - or did I miss that in the prospectus? <br /><br />In any event, fingers crossed each of us get what we want - whether its staying as a renter or going in as a buyer :-)
