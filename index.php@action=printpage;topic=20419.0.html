The primary is scheduled to take place on June 22.<br /><br />Danny Dromm, the current office holder, is ineligible to seek re-election due to term limits.<br /><br />We talk to Quiroz in a podcast about his campaign and his platform.<br /><br />Quiroz discusses his goal of improving the small business environment and the local healthcare system in the wake of the pandemic. He also says that he brings a unique voice to these issues as a gay Latino.<br /><br />He also says that he is an advocate for the 34th Avenue open street program and would like to see a small dog run built at Travers Park if elected.<br /><br />Quiroz has been active in the community in the 20 years he has lived in the district.<br /><br /><strong>He was the president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Queens, was a Democratic District Leader and a former Community Board 3 member. He is currently a member of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.<br /></strong><br />Quiroz was also the deputy chief of staff to former Councilmember Helen Sears, who represented the district prior to Dromm. He worked in public relations for Con Edison until two months ago.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">You can listen to the podcast:https://jacksonheightspost.com/podcast-we-talk-to-alfonso-quiroz-candidate-for-the-25th-council-district</span></strong>

				<span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Activist Valerie Bell Who Lost Her Son in a Police Shooting Endorsed Alfonso Quiroz for City Council</span><br /><br />Activist Valerie Bell, whose son was killed by police 15 years ago, has endorse candidate Alfonso Quiroz for the District 25 City Council seat.<br /><br />Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, said Quiroz will help reform law enforcement and keep communities safe in New York City if elected to the Council. She said she was proud to endorse him.<br /><br />“I am confident Alfonso Quiroz is the right voice for the residents of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst,” she said. “Alfonso understands that we must reform law enforcement, stand up for justice and keep our communities safe.”<br /><br />Sean Bell was 23-years-old when he was killed on the morning of his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, after leaving his bachelor party at a nightclub in Jamaica. Plainclothes officers fired more than 50 shots into his car after thinking his friend had a gun.<br /><br />Sean Bell died in the shooting and three of the five officers involved in the shooting faced criminal charges, but were ultimately acquitted.<br /><br />Valerie Bell founded Mothers of Never Again (MONA) following her son’s death and has been an activist for police reform for seven years.<br /><br />“Valerie Bell shows her character every day by turning her grief over the loss of her son into action on behalf of other New Yorkers,” Quiroz said. “She has dedicated herself to ending police violence, which too often takes the life of young people of color here in New York City and across the nation.”<br /><br />Quiroz’s platform on policing and criminal justice includes advocating for community-based policing, decriminalizing low-level offenses, ending the incarceration of people for low-level drug offenses and increasing funding for youth programs. He also opposes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) having a presence in local neighborhoods.<br /><br />“We need to let the many good police officers in our city do their jobs and hold accountable those who abuse our trust,” Quiroz said.<br /><br />The candidate has also been endorsed by former State Senator and City Council Member Thomas Duane; former State Senator and New York City Council Member representing District 25 John Sabini; New York State Assemblyman Danny O’Donnell; the LGBTQ Victory Fund; Stonewall Democratic Club of New York City and former New York State Governor David Paterson among others.<br /><br />He is one of eight candidates running to replace Council Member Daniel Dromm, who is term-limited.

It has gone from 1-2 men to upwards of 8-10. And for the record sometimes they do sleep on top of one another.<br /><br />The quality of life on the block is horrendous. The stench permeates even across the street. And, on more than one occasion I have stepped over a stream from them urinating live. It’s so depressing. So what do you suggest we do? Just let it be? No. There has to be some middle ground. These men need to be placed in a shelter where they can receive adequate food and have access to necessities. Living under an awning is not a viable solution for any of us.
