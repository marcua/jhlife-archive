					Some well planned bike lanes, with greater separation to protect cyclists are a good thing.<br />For instance, I&#039;m wondering why we don&#039;t have bike lanes on that section of Broadway below Northern Boulevard which was narrowed from two lanes in each direction one lane in each direction several years ago?<br />NYC and other cities are clearly moving to accept bicycling as part of a more environmentally sustainable transportation strategy, but this won&#039;t happen to lease everyone.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak about Sunnyside bike lanes because I really don&#039;t know the area that much. <br />Pursuing bike lanes, seems to be the ONLY environmental sustainability strategy that NYC seems to have any interest these days. The current mayor has been a disappointment compared to his predecessor on THIS issue. With global warming a reality, we need to be doing things to make sure the city remains a reasonable place to live in and to be outdoors in during summer.

					The problem is less our elected officials -- as in the very responsive City Councilman Danny Dromm -- than us. We need to make more noise. Another factor, Brooklyn Heights is a more affluent community and people know how and where to complain. Views on Jackson Heights Life isn&#039;t counted by electeds. But they do count phone calls, emails and letters. <br />If people get organized and make phone calls to get that police officer back at 73rd and 37th -- as well as praise the 115 every time they do it, it will make a difference. <br />FYI, it appears the 11372 zip code has a good deal greater population density than Brooklyn Heights. All those town houses far fewer people than our apartment buildings.

					IMHO, hotels are not really the best place for the homeless, so I can understand why some people here may not be thrilled with the possibility of this being a hotel. Assisted housing run by some nonprofit groups where homeless folks can live in a helping community that provides real services is what works. From my reporting experience, when these places are well run and not focused on profits, they don&#039;t negatively affect neighborhoods.

					From our experience the city is not unreasonable here.<br />The tree guards protect the soil against compaction from foot traffic, which damages roots and reduces water to the tree. That is one of the biggest problems street trees face. They also <em>discourage</em> cars from driving up on sidewalk and hitting trees. Trucks are another matter! City says trees with guards survive at a higher rate than those that don&#039;t, and I think that makes sense. <br />I&#039;ve seen some places, I think along Second Avenue in Manhattan, where property owners or some agency has sunk heavy-duty metal poles in the ground along the curb to protect the tree guards and trees against cars and trucks.<br /><br />Just to make one thing clear, JHBG did not install the relatively new guards on 74th Street that are in bad condition. Those are modular guards with pieces that snap off rather than the entire tree guard being damaged, but that only works if someone is replacing the broken pieces. In hindsight that probably wasn&#039;t the best location for them.

					Chingwa,<br /><br />Good question about the missing side of tree guards. According to NYC Parks there&#039;s no fourth side because that side would be more likely to be hit by cars and trucks, not only damaging that side, but the entire tree guard. That&#039;s also the reason why the tree guards are a foot away from the curb, to avoid collisions of cars and trucks with tree guards. Thank you for the question. JHBG has installed most of the tree guards on 37th and we will be putting in another three this year. BTW, we did NOT install the new one&#039;s in front of the Bruson Building, which look great!

					Thanks abc...<br />If this were Manhattan or a fashionable section of Brooklyn, it would happen. We&#039;re Queens, so we have to fight getting screwed, let alone have some creative thinking applied to make things better.<br />All the best.

					Some people made a similar argument that there was nothing wrong with putting up a huge shopping mall in the CitiField parking lot, even though that is also parkland. <br />A parking lot in a park may seem fair game for development, but NYS (and perhaps other places) sees parkland as special and that building upon it requires the state Legislature to pass a bill alienating park use.<br />Don&#039;t mean to preach, but parkland really is special. It&#039;s not just for our use now, but for those of future generations - so we need a different way of thinking about what happens to these places. <br />Using parkland as a parking lot doesn&#039;t have to be permanent. It&#039;s easy to tear up blacktop, but when significant-sized buildings are put up on parkland, practically speaking it&#039;s not likely to revert to parkland again. <br />I&#039;d much rather see a swap with the more accessible Citifield parking lot turned into a true park and a parking structure for Citifield put up on the parking east of Roosevelt Ave. That would produce a big gain in real usable parkland. <br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">A weird tangent: a few years ago NYC Parks reduced the size of Flushing Meadows Corona Park by roughly 100 acres, not because they diverted any land, but they remeasured the park and found it was smaller than they had long thought.</span><br />All the best.

					Lindsey,<br /><br />No age limit as long as a parent is with the little one. We want to get the kids off right with planting and doing things for community. This week we are out on Sunday instead of our more frequent Saturdays. We meet at 80th Street and 37th Avenue at 10 a.m. Hope to see you soon.

					JK Resident,<br /><br />I notice no apology or admission that you were just making things up last night in order to smear the campaign to expand the Jackson Heights historic district. <br /><br />And now you are making things up about affordable housing being built when bulldozers roll into Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Affordable housing being built in LIC, in what is considered the most massive development/redevelopment project in the nation??? There were ZERO affordable housing units built or planned in the redevelopment of Long Island City when I wrote a report for Metro New York a year and a half ago. If it&#039;s changed since then, I&#039;d be happy to hear of it because it is needed. At that time there were 6,000 units built and another 16,000 planned for the massive market-driven development along Jackson Avenue and around Queensborough Plaza. (The waterfront development is a different kind of animal it was organized by the New York State.) <br /><br />Also you refuse to acknowledge that a historic district does not prevent new construction. We had a new six-story building put up on 37th Avenue a few years ago and a five-story building is planned there too, both replacing one-story structures. Historic district status requires that new construction be in character with the surrounding neighborhood.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights (zip code, 11372) is already one of the densest neighborhoods in NYC; it was well planned; it has distinctive architecture; it&#039;s on the U.S. Register of Historic Places. Put hey, it&#039;s in Queens so lets make some big bucks.</strong><br /><br />Another fantasy you wrote about last night was that the new subway computerized signaling system would solve our transit crowding problems. If I remember correctly, this improvement will result in a roughly 10 percent increase in subway service during rush hours, maybe keeping up with the ridership growth that we&#039;ve had in the last 20 years&nbsp; due to new construction in Queens, and doing nothing to account for future construction.<br /><br />It will NOT provide subway service in the vast parts of Queens that are a transit dessert. These folks need to take buses to get to the 7 Train or the Queens Boulevard lines. A new subway line would serve these folks and lessen the load on the above subway lines. <br /><strong><br />Well that&#039;s it. I don&#039;t have time to keep fact-checking the stuff you put out. Perhaps we should just ignore it.</strong>

					<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Looks like yet another battle is looming. The U.S. Tennis Association is planning its latest expansion on to public property in Flushing Meadow-Corona Park. <br />&nbsp;<br />Only a few years ago, the USTA got permission for a major expansion of its operations in the park. The concrete is barely dry and they are at it again, planning to take more public parkland to enlarge its operations. <br /><br />The park is not the USTA&#039;s private property. We will need to send that message to our public officials because every incursion into the park makes the next incursion easier. Once parkland is lost, it is gone forever.<br /><br />There will be more news following, including plans on how to stop this confiscation of public property. I&#039;ve broken out the top of the story below. Follow the link for the full story. <br /><em><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">Permits have been filed for a two-story broadcast building at 122-04 Roosevelt Avenue inside Flushing Meadows Corona Park, in Queens. Details are not available for the precise location, but the most likely area is part of a parking lot near the Flushing Meadows train yard along Roosevelt Avenue. The United States Tennis Association is responsible for the development.<br /><br />The 30-foot-tall structure will yield 21,110 square feet of commercial space. Offices will occupy the entire space. Matthew L. Rossetti Architect is responsible for the design.</span></em><br /><br /><a href="https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/06/permits-filed-for-122-04-roosevelt-avenue-flushing-meadows-corona-park-queens.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/06/permits-filed-for-122-04-roosevelt-avenue-flushing-meadows-corona-park-queens.html</a></span>
