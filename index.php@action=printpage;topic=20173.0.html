				In Gov. Cuomo&#039;s press conference today he included new maps of Covid clusters throughout New York state. There are two clusters in Queens, and all of Jackson Heights from Northern Blvd. south is on the outer edges of the central Queens cluster. Since we are in the yellow zone, according to the guidelines these are the restrictions:<br />* Gatherings limited to 25 people, indoors and outdoors (good luck enforcing that in our teeming parks)<br />* Max 4 people to a table for outdoor dining<br />* Schools open w/ mandatory weekly testing for students and staff <br /><br />https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1313595129912004614?s=20

				Unsurprising.<br /><br />Mixed messages. <br /><br />The President minimizing COVID. The State not. <br /><br />Many average citizens are completely confused. <br /><br />And rightly so.

				I don&#039;t get what is the purpose of these zone. How does it prevent anyone from red zone to just walk few blocks down and dine in the restaurant. Or take subway few stops to hit the gym or get a haircut. Is the purpose just to make people in red zone inconvenience.

				it&#039;s to punish businesses for disobeying the rules and causing public health hazards. yes, the people in the zones can go a subway stop or two to get a meal, but if enough businesses are forced out of business, lessons will be learned. tough love, baby. tough love.

(And it probably helps keep spread lower to keep people from going into the area as well)

				The city has added an interactive map of the zones at:<br />https://nycgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/lookup/index.html?appid=021940a41da04314827e2782d3d1986f (https://nycgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/lookup/index.html?appid=021940a41da04314827e2782d3d1986f)

				Yeah, new case rates in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst have basically doubled, and people are still dying of COVID in these neighborhoods (at a rate of about one or two per week).<br /><br />If you order the NYC zip codes by deaths per 100,000 in the last 7 days, you&#039;ll notice that almost all the recent deaths are in the boroughs, hardly any in Manhattan. Not sure this will be a news story anytime soon, though, because, well, you know.&nbsp; https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases.html<br /><br />Good news, however, is that Elmhurst and Jackson Heights neighborhoods are pretty much just tracking the citywide average for new cases per person per day (and not above that average, like Williamsburg or northern LIC). Woodside and Corona are actually below the city average.&nbsp; You can track the new case per person per day rate in each zip code over the last week at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/nyregion/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases.html<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing the best way to protect businesses during this surge is to encourage &quot;free&quot; (not economically costly) norms to stop the spread, and the cheapest and freest is to do whatever actually works to encourage universal mask-wearing.&nbsp; What actually works does not include glaring or shaming, apparently. Perhaps if attractive, everyone-wants-to-be-like-them, trend-setter types stay masked at restaurants when not eating, drink through a straw behind their mask in a way that makes that look sexy, etc., that might work. Or musicians roaming the streets and subway cars with banjos or accordions singing upbeat &quot;I love my life-saving mask&quot; songs (in masks, ideally).<br /><br />For those who don&#039;t like Trump but are nevertheless annoyed by COVID precautions (a non-negligible number of people), it might also be good to have online watch parties for Alex Gibney&#039;s new doc &quot;Totally Under Control&quot;, coming out in a couple of days. Reviewing credible evidence that a political clique is more concerned with personal and political gain than your life and health can make those receptive to that evidence want to take more effective action to keep themselves and others alive. Perhaps don&#039;t show the film to Trump supporters, though, as they are likely to mistrust the messenger.<br /><br />https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/movies/they-refused-to-act-inside-a-chilling-documentary-on-trumps-bungled-covid-19-response/ar-BB19YK3b
