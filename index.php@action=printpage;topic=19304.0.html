				After the switch to HD, the only problem I had was losing WNYC/13, everything else came through fine.&nbsp; Then CBS2 (which I received at channel 33.1) announced that there would be some frequencies added and to re-scan for digital channels after August 1st. Which I did and then was out of town for a couple of weeks. Now I&#039;ve lost reception on pretty much every channel I was getting before the re-scan, but the weird thing is this - when I re-scan and it finishes, the set defaults to CBS2 which comes in perfectly. However when I change the channel and try to return to the previous channel (CBS2) it&#039;s gone, not even an option to manually input the channel.<br />Anybody else have weird stuff going on with broadcast TV?<br />

				Hmm, that&#039;s strange. I rescanned mine on Aug 1 and the first time some of my channels were missing but when I did it again everything was good. No problems since.

				I&#039;ve rescanned twice, with the same result. It&#039;s not a smart TV, so I don&#039;t think I need to clear any cookies there. But maybe I will try unplugging it and plugging it back in&nbsp; :o

				Figured it out, had to use the AUTO PROGRAM function, <strong>not</strong> the ADD DIGITAL CHANNELS function...

				I still have problems with Channel 2 from time to time. From bad reception to the whole channel being out (usually happens in the morning).

				Funny I actually am starting to think the signals are being blocked.&nbsp; I too lose ch 13 and 14,&nbsp; as well as ch 7.&nbsp; I notice that if some trucks honk it interferes with the signal.
