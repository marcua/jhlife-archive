					It is hard to tell from photos alone, but that appears to be laminate flooring:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-laminate-flooring-1821619" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-laminate-flooring-1821619</a><br /><br />It is possible the original floor is underneath, but you won&#039;t know if it is and if it is worth refinishing until you remove the laminate. You might be able to get some information through the broker if the current owner put the flooring in. You may also be able to find photos from when the apartment was last listed for sale - this often provides some clues. <br /><br />If it is worth it to replace is a question only you can answer. I am guessing the flooring bothers you if you are posting these questions. You may be able to negotiate a lower price based on the fact that you can&#039;t live with that floor. <br /><br />Good luck with your search!

					It still seems a challenge to get a vaccine appointment and the general recommendation is to get whichever you can get soonest (J&amp;J, Phizer, or Moderna). If a medical professional told you specifically to only get J&amp;J because of health conditions you have, then that&#039;s a different story of course. I&#039;m not even sure if this is something that doctors specify to their patients. I know some people with certain conditions are advised against getting a vaccine.<br /><br />Most people shouldn&#039;t overthink it, just get the soonest appointment for any COVID vaccine.

					Call 1 (877) 208-8318. <br /><br />I believe this goes directly to the NYC Health Dept. COVID hotline. I know of two people that were able to get appointments easily calling this number.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure 311 will direct you there as well.

					As of 8:00AM this morning, all New Yorkers 30 years of age are eligible to receive the vaccine. By April 6th vaccination will be available to all New Yorkers 16 years and older. <br /><br />This came much sooner than I expected as those 50 and older only became eligible last week. Did all the people over 50 that wanted the vaccine already manage to schedule appointments?<br /><br />I fall in the group that became eligible today and through persistence and dumb luck I managed to schedule an appointment tomorrow through <a href="https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/</a> I was also checking the State&#039;s website for availability at Javits Center and Aqueduct Racetrack. <a href="https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/</a> On both sites the appointments would appear and disappear as soon as I clicked on them. Extremely frustrating. <br /><br />A friend told me that her brother had luck today calling (877) 829-4692 which I think is NYC Health and Hospitals.

					I&#039;m also curious about this building. I&#039;ve seen a lot of listings online there recently and it appears the building has some nice amenities (roof deck!) and is well maintained. It does always concern me when I see a lot of units for sale in one building. As per StreetEasy, there are currently 6 active units, 4 of which are in contract. As this is a 52 unit building, this is more than 10% of the units. There were also a few recent sales and 1 or 2 attempted sales that delisted in 2020. It makes me wonder if people are fleeing the building or if it is just a coincidence. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been inside and I don&#039;t think I know anyone that lives there. It&#039;s definitely not the prettiest block in Jackson Heights, but it is definitely the nicest building on that block (at least from the outside). It&#039;s also close to the subway, which is nice. <br /><br />Best of luck in your search!

Do you believe this is why Farine closed? Why would Farine be impacted by this and not other bakeries in the neighborhood? <br /><br />Since Cannelle has been in business longer, they have had more time to develop a loyal customer base, which I&#039;m sure helps. They also were quick to put safety measures in place after they reopened. Cannelle had long lines outdoors, limiting capacity indoors when grocery stores were doing the same. Farine did not appear to make much of an effort to reopen. Perhaps it wasn&#039;t feasible financially for them?

					I went on Sunday afternoon and I waited in line for about 30-45 minutes. A poll worker came out at one point and said that seniors don&#039;t have to wait in line and can move to the front of the line. When I was near the entrance, two seniors appeared who were turned off by the long line and were about to postpone until another day - Myself and another person in line stopped them and told them that seniors don&#039;t have to wait in the line. They spoke to the poll worker at the entrance and were let in with the next group. <br /><br />Any seniors should take note of this.

					I can only speak about co-op apartments - I&#039;m noticing that those sellers that are willing to reduce their asking prices are selling their apartments and those that are defiantly sticking to pre-pandemic pricing are not. 1 bedrooms in desperate need of a renovation shouldn&#039;t be asking over $400,000 in Jackson Heights now and I&#039;d argue that they shouldn&#039;t have been last year. I think the market got ahead of itself. <br /><br />Most apartments that sold in the second quarter of this year likely were in contract pre-pandemic. An apartment in my building went into contract in October and did not close until May. I&#039;m guessing there were other factors that delayed the closing, but the pandemic definitely didn&#039;t help. I was surprised by the relatively high price that apartment sold for. A similar apartment in my building closed in August for about 20% less. I&#039;m not sure when that one went into contract.

It&#039;s obvious that many people miss Farine and I wasn&#039;t suggesting that your feelings of loss are not reasonable. It was always nice to see the location filled with customers when I passed by pre-pandemic, but I only made purchases on a few occasions. Clearly it was a popular place. Although it is horrible to see a small local business fail, I prefer a grocery store to an empty store front. I have a hard time seeing a grocery store as a bad thing for the neighborhood. If it has the same ownership, perhaps Farine will return when the situation improves to better support their bakery.

					This is officially the first time I&#039;ve heard people complain about having too many grocery stores. Isn&#039;t that a good thing? I love the broad range of options for grocery shopping in JH. I can find most ingredients within a few blocks, even ones that are not typically found in US grocery stores. If we lived in a food desert, I think that would be a valid thing to complain about.

Back in March, when it became clear that I&#039;d be doing more cooking at home I bought some high quality pots and pans online from C21. It took forever for them to arrive (everything was taking longer to arrive at that time), but I&#039;m so happy that I got them. I hadn&#039;t realized how horrible the pots and pans I replaced were.<br /><br />Sadly, I think we will see more closures of local businesses like this one. It seems that so many people default to making online purchases from Amazon instead of considering NYC based companies.
