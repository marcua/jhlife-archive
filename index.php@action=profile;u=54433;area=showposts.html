					I did notice a space on the same floor as Blink Gym is available.&nbsp; Not sure how loud it is since the block is adjacent to Roosevelt, might be ok since the building is big and office might be deeper into the building.&nbsp; Might make sense to be close to the one other major gym facility considering Blink doesn&#039;t offer classes like yours and it might be good to have fitness-interested traffic near your front door...&nbsp; I was just looking for space for my business too, and find that location interesting but I don&#039;t need so much space.<br /><br />I might be a customer as the lack of yoga options in the neighborhood that fit my schedule often leaves me doing yoga by myself at Blink <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					If anything it seems to me JH is in less of a bubble than much of Brooklyn and Manhattan.&nbsp; I bought here 2 years ago because it just seemed ridiculous how much real estate you could get here given almost all factors I could compare to places I saw in brooklyn, manhattan and LIC/astoria.&nbsp; If anything it seems to me this may only be the beginning for real estate in JH, since rising prices will also lead to even more desirable businesses and stores locating here.&nbsp; Really the main thing we don&#039;t have here compared to places in Brooklyn that are still twice the price and the same distance from Manhattan is certain types of businesses, but those may come as the residents who seek them out arrive, only further improving value here.

					Of course an inexpensive gym in an area without other gyms will be a bit crowded.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s not more crowded actually.&nbsp; For the price it&#039;s great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve paid more for other gyms in Manhattan an they were quite a bit worse in terms of space and machine availability, and they have gyms every couple blocks there.&nbsp; Blink definitely fits a need in the neighborhood and I&#039;m not aware of any reasonable alternative in the area that isn&#039;t a trek if you live somewhat near Blink.<br /><br />I think in any gym in NYC you probably have to be willing to adjust your workout depending on the availability of machines or be willing to wait for the one you want.

					Are people really renting those apartments for those prices?&nbsp; I know the building reasonably well since I put an offer on one of the 3br units and viewed a lot of the units just before they went rental almost a year ago.&nbsp; At the time most of the units had been sitting on the market for years.&nbsp; I liked some of the units, but even the triple-pane glass and privacy coating on all the 7-train-facing windows seemed quite insufficient and I don&#039;t think I&#039;d have expected they&#039;d have an easy time renting any of those apartments.<br /><br />The construction looked alright, and it did stand out as being seeing fairly modern compared to most of what is available in the area.&nbsp; There were a lot of places where they really skimped on materials and space, though.&nbsp; All the counters seemed to be two pieces of granite sandwiched together with the seam visible on all of the countertop edges, which seemed very odd.&nbsp; And the bathrooms were about as small as you can comfortably make a bathroom and the bedrooms were not especially spacious and some of the floorboards I saw were warped.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure it would be considered a luxury building in other more expensive neighborhoods like LIC, williamsburg, downtown brooklyn, or anywhere in manhattan.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s all relative, though.<br /><br />The rent prices appear to all be about $1000 more than the monthly payments would have been on buying any of those units, which seems really exorbitant and unrealistic so I&#039;m skeptical, but good for them if they actually found people to pay that...

					I put in a complaint as well.&nbsp; The first one plane I heard on Saturday was on 6:15am.&nbsp; I remember because it woke me up and they kept coming all day.&nbsp; I watched a movie in the evening and the loud planes were still flying overhead.<br /><br />That has been the worst airplane noise I&#039;ve heard since I moved to JH a couple months ago.&nbsp; Seems like usually if they reroute the planes on a Saturday it doesn&#039;t start until 8am and doesn&#039;t last all day.

					I&#039;m selling my Vizio E3D420VX 42&quot; 3D TV as I just replaced it with a projector. This TV has been great, and it still works very well. I&#039;ll include 5 pairs of 3D polarized glasses (same ones used in 3D theaters) that work with this TV. Also includes the remote and power cable. Polarized, passive 3D is by far the most convenient and it looks great. Obviously this TV also works great as a regular 2D TV but it also supports all kinds of 3D content (over-under, side-by-side, etc). Will consider reasonable offers as well.<br /><br />Here is the manufacturer&#039;s website page about the TV for more information:<br /><a href="http://store.vizio.com/e3d420vx.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://store.vizio.com/e3d420vx.html</a><br /><br />Located at 73rd st in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; If you are close by, I can help you carry it.&nbsp; It&#039;s light enough I can carry it alone, but an extra hand may help if you&#039;re going more than a couple blocks.

					I&#039;ve been curious about the idea of an e-bike.&nbsp; I&#039;d worry about parking or safety for anything larger.&nbsp; I mean they seem to work well for lots of delivery guys <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />They can be quite inexpensive which might make them less worrisome since it&#039;s not quite as unpleasant if it got stolen.&nbsp; And you could probably store it inside your apartment or building&#039;s bike storage which is much safer and cheaper than having to get a parking spot or leaving it on the street all year.

					My wife and I are just about to close on an apartment in JH after renting in Astoria for 2 years.&nbsp; Astoria is great, but the lower prices and extra subways in JH really sold us.&nbsp; We will miss Socrates park but central park is still only 4 stops on the F train.&nbsp; JH just seems like it has everything, and I love cooking so being a block or two from Indian, Chinese, Korean, and American american supermarkets seems pretty awesome.&nbsp; Not to mention the restaurants.<br /><br />Oh and my wife travels a lot for work so it&#039;ll be nice to be so close to LGA/JFK when I want to meet her at the airport.<br /><br />Then again we haven&#039;t actually moved to JH yet, so my practical experience with the neighborhood is a bit lacking <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />
