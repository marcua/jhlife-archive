				It is possible that you are not in City Council District 21. You may be in the 25th which is represented by Danny Dromm who does not have a primary challenger. <br /><br />The Assembly District is not the same as the City Council District

				I was confused too. I thought I could vote in this race, but when a neighbor in a nearby building just posted on FB that she didn&#039;t see the Moya/Monserratte race on her ballot, I realized I should check the district map. There are very few blocks in JH that are in District 21. Approximately 82nd St. up through 94th is on there but ONLY between Roosevelt and 37th Ave. So, for example, Linden Court residents could vote in this race.<br /><br />After 94th St. the district expands north. http://vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/maps/2017/co/co21.pdf

				That Linden Court block contributed at least two votes to the candidate that didn&#039;t beat his girlfriend and commit fraud. So proud.

				The NYT has called Moya the winner of the Dem primary, with 55% over Montserrate&#039;s 45%. <br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york-primary-elections?mcubz=0

				The fact that Montserrate got 45% should be a wake up call to Queens Democrats that the anti-establishment mood is alive and well and living even here in NYC.&nbsp; That said, I wonder if Montserrate allies spent too much time putting their efforts into District 25 otherwise known as Daniel Dromm&#039;s district.&nbsp; I saw tons of signs in the historic district that Montserrate wouldn&#039;t have even represented.&nbsp; Got to wonder what would&#039;ve happened if Montserrate moved into District 25 to take Dromm on and not split the Hispanic vote with Moya.&nbsp; Keep a lookout for a U-Haul rolling up to Montserrate&#039;s house tomorrow (or sometime before the next filing deadline).&nbsp; Dromm ran unopposed today FWIW.

				Or maybe Monserrate will run for Moya&#039;s Assembly seat? <br />Time to start talking about that seat. <br />I&#039;ve got a few names in mind. The one I heard for certain comes right from Moya&#039;s office and is really bad at answering phones though she&#039;s been at it at least 6 years. <br /><br />So that&#039;s two candidates. <br />This is another greatly gerrymandered district.. Map attached, with 11372 outlined. <br />Sorry, not attached. I&#039;m never able to attach pics. I checked the size this time but still won&#039;t post.

				The only signs I saw in the historic district were in places like Seba Seba, which might be frequented by a lot of voters from District 21. If they were knocking on doors in District 25, then yes, that would be a waste of time.
