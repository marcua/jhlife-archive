Her love of the Spanish language and desire to raise her<br />own daughter in a bilingual environment prompted her to learn traditional<br />Spanish children&#039;s songs. While living in Long Island City with her newborn, she<br />found a community of like-minded parents and continues to meet with them on a<br />weekly basis to teach songs, sing together, and foster a safe and loving<br />community for their babies. On average, Gail sings to about twenty-five babies a<br />week. Now back in Jackson Heights, she hopes to build a similar community for<br />her family here.
