				I&#039;m 6 months pregnant and the maternity policy at my work is pretty generous, but I will eventually need to go back to work. For those of us who don&#039;t have relatives or whose spouses both will need to go back to work, how do you do it? I&#039;m a bit loss at my options and, I feel like I&#039;m already failing as a parent, as when I talk to my co-workers it seems they had daycare lined up from the get-go...

				Hi, I just want to say youâ€™re not failing as a parent. Infant daycare is hard to come by in our neighborhood, unfortunately. Many programs only take little ones when they are two years old. I hope you joined the JH families google group. There is a Facebook group as well.

				&nbsp;Yutna, please do not blame yourself for this societal deficiency. It&#039;s a problem in the whole US and many other industrialized countries too. I am so mad that this continues to happen to mothers and to families like yours that I would volunteer to help myself if I could. Know that there is support out there but sometimes you don&#039;t find it till you are closer to the need. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and delivery. It shouldn&#039;t be this way.

Some places have spots open at the last minute, and in others you really just need to line it up a few months before you need it. You can search for Group Family Daycares at the link below. Most take babies as young as 6 weeks. They are small, so many are full, but just call around. https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/childcare/looking/ccfs-search.php<br /><br />You can also search for commercial daycares here.<br />https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/ChildCare/ChildCareList.do<br /><br />For recommendations, joining jhfamilies is a great tip. And you can also ask people with babies and young kids that you see on the street... this is a friendly neighborhood!<br /><br />Just know that you are NOT behind or failing in any way. Good luck!<br /><br />P.s. feel free to post any follow up questions
