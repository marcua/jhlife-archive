					There has definitely been an increase in the amount of graffitti on 81st Street, particularly on the block between 35th and 34th. I first noticed a large &quot;POOZ&quot; or &quot;ROOZ&quot; or whatever they were trying to spell on the side of a building on that block. The same markings showed up on the green mail storage box on that block within a day, and then a white van was covered with the same markings. It looks like someone tried to remove the graf from the mail storage box, and POOZ struck again on the same mailbox a day later. To add insult to injury, they colored in the prior mark on the side of the first building. <br /><br />This is really disturbing and annoying. Houses in Corona, Elmhurst and other areas have graffitti on the side of them and I find it really sad that someone would deface another person&#039;s home like that. <br /><br />Has anyone else noticed additional graffitti in their area? I know the JHBG does alot of cleanup and they&#039;re short-handed. I&#039;m willing to spend some time this weekend cleaning up (with or without the group). Anybody have tips on how to do it (or willing to help?)

					For the past few weeks I&#039;ve noticed a motorcycle that is parked really obnoxiously on 81st Street between 34th &amp; Northern.&nbsp; This bike almost always parks parallel to the curb, or almost parallel to the curb, and then wastes as much space in front/behind it as possible.&nbsp; As the driver of a compact car, the wasted space is really glaring. <br /><br />Maybe I just don&#039;t know enough about motorcycles.&nbsp; Is there a reason to park a bike this way?

					I really wanted hummus one night and didn&#039;t know of any place in JH with a good hummus. I stopped by a hole-in-the wall Mediterranean/Asian/Indian place (I know, weird combo) and decided to give them a try. It turns out that the place was new and the owner was very chatty so I started talking with him. I told him that I came from JH and it would be nice to have some more food options in the area. I asked if he had considered JH when he was looking for locations for his restaurant.&nbsp; He said that he was very familiar with JH as he has family members that live there.&nbsp; He decided against JH because he didn&#039;t think the neighborhood could support his restaurant.&nbsp; His take was that JH has more families and working class people who don&#039;t have the discretionary income/won&#039;t go out as often. He felt that Astoria has more young professionals who are interested in eating out, so he had a greater chance for success in that neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was kinda disheartened by that. I wonder how many other people decide not to open here because they feel the same way.&nbsp; It appears that he might be right, just going by observation, but I haven&#039;t looked at the census info or anything to know for sure. Has anybody had a similar experience? Is there any way to change the perception.&nbsp; Going by this forum, it seems like there are lots of people here who are interested in a wider variety of food options.<br /><br />I apologize in advance if this topic has been covered to death and I missed it.

					Is it just me, or are there alot of co-ops for sale in the area lately? I know there&#039;s usually an increase in listed properties in most areas during the summer, as sellers try to capitalize on increased foot traffic.However, after perusing listings on Craigslist, Streeteasy and various broker sites, there seems to be quite a bit of inventory. Is it just the summer rush? Or are people fleeing the area?

					I apologize if this is a duplicate post. I recently got my finger smashed between two doors at the Roosevelt-74th street train station. The doors are on the side facing Roosevelt--- across the street from Dunkin Donuts. Upon further investigation, I noticed that there&#039;s a high probability for injury with those doors. The handicap-access door and the door immediately to the right of it open onto each other and have heavy metal handles. If you are trying to be nice, holding the door for someone else could be very dangerous there. I&#039;m not sure why those doors don&#039;t open away from each other instead of onto each other, but they should. <br /><br />I reported it to the MTA station manager, but I doubt anything will be done until someone sustains a more serious injury.&nbsp; Has anybody else had any experiences with those doors?
