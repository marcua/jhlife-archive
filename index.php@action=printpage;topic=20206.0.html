				My building (a large coop) has experienced an increase in stolen packages.&nbsp; Management response is essentially &quot;watch for your packages.&quot;&nbsp; Understandable, but not always possible when people are at work, etc.<br /><br />Have any buildings found solutions to this problem - creating package storage, lockers, or anything else?<br /><br />TIA

				Sorry you&#039;re going through this. Seems like a very common problem during the pandemic. My building (rental) has also had a problem with stolen packages. It was really bad earlier on in the pandemic, but seems to have decreased a bit as of late (knock on wood). No actions taken by management though, other than putting up a sign threatening prosecution...LOL. Like that would ever happen.<br /><br />I jokingly toyed with the idea of camping out in the mail area and checking IDs when people come to pick up their packages. <br /><br />My personal solution has been to use an Amazon locker or UPS Access Point when applicable (NOT the UPS store, which is a MESS), or run to the mail area the second I get a delivery confirmation text. I realize that&#039;s not always possible if you&#039;re away at work, but my industry is still not back yet so I have lots of time to obsessively stalk my delivery tracking info. <br /><br />Hope you find something that works for you--

				This is the previous thread discussing how Amazon has installed a hub in a building lobby to prevent thefts etc. Perhaps a small Amazon hub/locker can be installed in your lobby?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19562.msg96829#msg96829

My only gripe is that since it&#039;s a tiny store it can feel a little crammed inside, but it&#039;s 1,000x better than the UPS store on 83rd.

				Same problem here on 88th and 35th. My recent Amazon purchase was delivered by FedEx to someone who signed for it. I received a shipping notice of the 12th with an expected delivery date of 10/20-23th, but it was stolen on the 14th, a week earlier. It never sat in the mail area as someone took it directly from the FedEx driver. <br /><br />I had read somewhere that thieves were following the drivers into a building. It could even be an inside job between driver and thief. At any rate, this can&#039;t stand forever. Too much loss. Customers (us) are going to end up paying somehow to cover it.<br />
