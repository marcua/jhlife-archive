Also, the butcher in Grand Central Market has surprisingly good prices for pancetta when they have it in stock.

Just as they have many things that are cheese like at their new(ish) cheese counter. The fact of the matter is that NONE of the grocery stores in the immediate area have managers or buyers that can negotiate common place foodstuffs that somehow remain exotic around here. We could really use a small, dedicated store that sells such things run by someone that is knowledgeable. I hope that whomever takes over the Appetitto space can do that, but I&#039;m cautious of being too optimistic.&nbsp;

				I really do hope they are successful bc it appears it&#039;s a young couple that owns it. Must be a tough business though... I guess it will go hand in hand with Table Wine which appears to be a sustainable business. If I were them, I&#039;d do a lot of outreach at Table Wine, Queensboro, Farine. Maybe make a branded Stand Alone plate. <br /><br /><br />I did go into the foodtown yesterday and they actually do have a healthy cheese selection.

				Foodtown&#039;s cheese counter is actually decent -- good, by supermarket standards. a nice selection of stiltons and cheddars (had a very nice whiskey washed one last week) and some decent triple cremes. it&#039;s kind of random in terms of stocking, but i usually find something worth picking up.

				stopped in this morning, and got my silver medal as the second paying customer :)<br /><br />the cheese selection is very nice, varied, and reasonably priced. got a nice funky Italian cow&#039;s milk for 16 per pound. the proprietors are knowledgeable, and there are written flavor profile descriptions on some of the lesser known options (and samples being offered).<br /><br />the pantry items also look good...didn&#039;t bring anything home, but a wide variety of jams, pickled things, veggies and nuts on display.<br /><br />wishing them the best of luck!

				Really wonderful little shop. these folks are full of knowledge and passion about the product they sell, and contrary to a lot of what is being said here, the farmers that produce a majority of their cheeses treat their animals more ethically than can be said about any of the meat served at every single other grocery store and restaurant in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m not sure why the conversation about this shop has gone in this direction, but not every other spot discussed here. Grass is often what makes cheese taste good, grass means access to pasture. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. This place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Now we just need a fish market and decent butcher shop and we will be all set!

				it should also be noted that the proprietors are both very gracious and good with customer service -- something that&#039;s not always a given for first-time shop owners. was in last night just before the scheduled closing time, and there were three or four customers, and all of us were treated really nicely and not rushed out the door (as is often the case at places that put a super-hard close on closing time).
