				New York YIMBY breaks the news that permits have been files for a new 15-story residential tower at 71-17 Roosevelt Avenue (http://newyorkyimby.com/2014/12/permits-filed-15-story-residential-building-at-71-17-roosevelt-avenue-jackson-heights.html), next to the CSX tracks and currently the site of a church.&nbsp; It will include 139 apartments, and unfortunately, far too much parking for a site so close to transit.<br /><br />Brownstoner Queens highlights this project alongside the White Castle project discussed on another thread (http://queens.brownstoner.com/2014/12/two-developments-slated-for-jackson-heights/)

I am far from an expert on interpreting zoning regulations, but I think there are all sorts of exceptions that can be made to build larger such as including &quot;community space,&quot; which I think includes &quot;medical offices.&quot; R6 buildings are required to include a lot of off-street parking. Hopefully someone who understands the regulations better will interpret further, but it seems like there&#039;s very limited street-front access there for a building that size.<br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r6.shtml<br /><br />area zoning map: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/zone/map9d.pdf

At least that&#039;s my understanding from looking at the images.<br /><br />In the second rendering, the entire 71-17 Roosevelt Ave parcel appears in black. You can see that the left most section of the black shape sits next to Roosevelt and is quite small, and then the part that&#039;s on the right, not abutting Roosevelt, is the tall and large part of the project.

				It&#039;s definitely one of those projects that leaves you scratching your head, wondering who would want to live there. As if being adjacent to the BQE and 7 train weren&#039;t enough, I&#039;m noticing that grand entrance on the side street in the last rendering. Isn&#039;t it lovely the way it&#039;s squeezed in among those private residences: I guess the developer ran out of the funds to buy off those home owners?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12694.msg81127.html#msg81127">Quote from: Lilybell on September 13, 2017, 10:57:02 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It just looks so out of place. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The older article from 2014 mentioned Gilman Architects as being involved and I think this may be the rendering of the building that they proposed based on the configuration of the adjacent highway, train tracks and surrounding buildings. Yes, I realize it makes the water appear much closer than reality but renderings often do things like this to emphasize views. The part of the building above the landscaped platform seems to have much less bulk than the current rendering. I&#039;m sure the developer is trying to fit as many apartments in as possible to make as much money as they can. <br /><br />(https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TMaQ9lUWMPEc9e6mS2j_JjJJuOD9pHPfV6PMZGzuAr-RsWuj8i9NejgTGUhlezFK7us0FEHMzpXFM4rKDK4K84roXDC1q_hMqudkIz1Hr6MVi7RE5C1mtz2KWrw5oUKFmB4HwZIkBWapHbggbQF_n2rQIu2PahZ0MuGH_I5Zu8jUvjd_Us61PvKAjNIZIhwNb4vI8OhP-OjoY5fcZ-FTXE24E5-6e4WybuJ9cn2e0Q6Qt5SxqZgocmc5izzV78Nh5_9hXrUcIYHb3KcIjIkP3McHzfSzvtkTh200jasUZX0t5iuRnOVkqMHP6YlvX-2xsccXMlEUvh2TnCVllVI0y0XXrdWz2rRBUCj106VKVeyixyEjNQi8sETdikTCFemNyDrKYkBu_wHETegk9yfbkLpCoBE02DjKXKGyoa6bvFrhhxyyeqsA44a1aipQJnj3leriskQg2nCOzJTFbudj0lh0acAr8KYTalq6sWlJ0wqwM-9_440ZoAZy8vg6Duhp-JaFVUCioN2OmD2qAyzDDRXl-PXZw0xd8vSC80WZfz55eCbvhlkloBoRTX41AB8fmaMBSe2iKkMjqljH04etQxnRxAiplT7oHm1hVEOuDA=w535-h728-no)<br /><br />I know many people, including myself, were skeptical that people would move into the somewhat new brick building on Roosevelt that looms over the 7 train at the 74th St station, but they did and I&#039;m sure it will be the same here. We all (mostly) accept that we live so near an airport as we know what a great neighborhood this is. Housing is tight.

				<br />I understand the concern about the congestion this building could potentially add to the nearby train lines, and I do feel bad for those surrounding home owners.&nbsp; That being said, it will be interesting to see the type of businesses that will pop up in and around that building, on Roosevelt or off.

				<br />https://commercialobserver.com/2017/11/werber-nabs-62m-loan-for-luxury-development-in-jackson-heights-queens/<br /><br />Werber Real Estate has secured a floating-rate, $61.5 million construction loan for a new apartment tower in Jackson Heights, Queens, according to HFF, which brokered the deal.<br /><br />The floating-rate loan, from Principal Global Investors, will fund the construction of Roosevelt Parc, already underway at 71-17 Roosevelt Avenue. The 15-story building will host 154 rental apartments—ranging from studios to four-bedrooms—and over 16,000 square feet of retail space.<br /><br />“Unlike Long Island City and Downtown Brooklyn, Jackson Heights has very little competition in the luxury rental segment.” Geoff Goldstein, a senior director at HFF, said. “The building’s got great transportation, and it’s a brand-new building, well designed, with a great developer.”<br /><br />The brokerage team said they did not have an estimate regarding when construction will be complete.<br /><br />With perks including a rooftop deck, a fitness center and a movie screening room—40,000 square feet of amenity space in total—the project looks to break ground in the neighborhood in more ways than one. As the looming L train shutdown condemns many Brooklyn residents to the prospect of a hellish commute in the coming years, ongoing improvements to the 7 line promise to make the trip from Jackson Heights to Manhattan a comparative cinch.<br /><br />As a result, the HFF team said, optimism abounds for Roosevelt Parc’s ability to attract luxury renters.<br /><br />“I think that was part of the challenge about this opportunity: it’s a hard project to comp in this submarket given its amenities,” Steven Klein, a managing director at HFF, said. “But because [Werber is] a local operator, they have first-hand knowledge of the submarket, and they know what renters are willing to pay.”<br /><br />Unlike Long Island City, a sleepy warehouse district in the years before its luxury-housing boom, Jackson Heights is already a bustling residential neighborhood—a trait that could cut both ways for one of the neighborhood’s first high-end developments.<br /><br />On the one hand, Roosevelt Parc will face little competition for residents seeking high-end digs in the area. On the other, the development could draw ire for boosting rents in a neighborhood whose residents rely on less inflated housing bills.<br /><br />The neighborhood, famous for its striking ethnic diversity, came to broader attention in 2015 as the subject of the film In Jackson Heights. The documentary, by acclaimed director Frederick Wiseman, highlighted the area’s importance as an affordable, welcoming destination for new immigrants to the U.S.<br /><br />“Times Square is often called the crossroads of the world, but Mr. Wiseman suggests that that title more rightly belongs to Jackson Heights,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.<br /><br /><br /><br />

At the moment, there is that enormous empty Sports Authority store with the huge empty parking lot. I wonder what will become of that. <br /><br />However, there might be development coming to that general area very soon. I don&#039;t know anything about the Sports Authority land, but there was just a major purchase of three parcels in that vicinity for $10 million. https://commercialobserver.com/2017/11/malachite-group-buys-woodside-queens-commercial-properties-for-10m/<br /><br />(https://nyocommercialobserver.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/woodside-portfolio.jpg?w=604)

				I have lived in JH for 11 years. As my fellow long time JH residents are well aware , it is an area the is evolving,&nbsp; but v e r y&nbsp; s l o w l y.

As I occasionally walk a long Roosevelt, in to Woodside, I have seen some places popping, up in Woodside, that may&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to some 30 somethings. But I have difficulty seeing people in that future building walking in to JH, because that locale is too far from the restaurants of 37th ave, and Northern. Also, there are no grocery stores in JH within walking distance of that locale..Although, I can see them exploring Woodside. I do see more elements of gentrification along Rossevelt in WS, than in JH. That being said , LIC luxury buildings appeal to families, but I have trouble seeing how that locale could appeal to young families. Also, Roosevelt ave in Woodside is less intense, and a little cleaner than in JH.<br />

And that&#039;s an awesome thing about Jackson Heights. The choice of trains. Because let&#039;s face it, in most other locales there are fewer trains. And when they go down, which is a common event nowadays, a person is completely stuck.&nbsp; Here we have a choice when lines are delayed. That&#039;s a huge reason to live in these apartments. And the truth of living in New York City these days.

				Many said that people were unlikely to move into the newish building on Roosevelt adjacent to the 7 train 74th St platform. It looks like that building is full now. I&#039;m sure this building will be the same. People have different priorities when looking for a home and we all have to make compromises. I&#039;m sure this new building will offer some great views.

				I&#039;ve been in downtown Flushing a lot lately. Today, it seemed to me that there must be a place they are just handing out bricks and having people just start towering them up. <br /><br />It&#039;s truly incredible the number of cranes in say a 10 block radius. <br />There&#039;s also an uncanny ability to plop many stories on top of a raggedy old building.

				I think this building has reached full height now. I walked by earlier along Roosevelt and it really doesn&#039;t seem as massive as I thought it would be. It may have just been the view I had from where I was walking, other blocks may appear differently. <br /><br />It looks like the retail space on Roosevelt is up for lease already:<br /><br />http://www.hellerorg.com/detail.aspx?id=24269CL (http://www.hellerorg.com/detail.aspx?id=24269CL)<br /><br />One of the two images is labeled as a &quot;community facility entrance&quot;.

I believe that is the outdoor area at SriPriPhi.

The actual photo is of Sripraphai garden. https://www.tripexpert.com/new-york-city/restaurants/sripraphai-thai-restaurant

				The reviews on Google are pretty bad<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Living at Roosevelt Parc was a horrible experience. Moving out early costs a $15,000 penalty. It has been a nightmare getting in touch with management since they ignore all emails. Very unprofessional.<br />Please notice that all positive reviews are from people who have not lived here yet. Once you live there the experience is negative. Stay away.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This building is an active construction site from morning till night with an awful management office.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">These people are thieves and are not and will not compensate tenants for their rent for the lack of amenities and much more. It has been very overwhelming for some tenants and it&#039;s disappointing to see the company be this way when people are clearly struggling. Rent has become difficult to pay and I have been looking for something cheaper and they have made it very difficult for anyone to leave.

Now with the pandemic I&#039;ve been working from home and I love it but this place is ruining for me, every morning at 7 am the construction noise wakes me, an hr before my alarm, it is frustrating. The bike room took forever to open, like 3 month after original date. Due to the pandemic, the lounge, the dinning room, the movie room, the gym, the internet room are all closed, and we still pay the same amount for rent, I feel like an not getting my money worth, If you understand what I&#039;m saying, and we not getting any insensitive from them.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They have a non-disparagement clause so you probably can&#039;t trust their overall rating.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Update. The place is ok but if you want to avoid a building with minimal management office support then stay away. Our lease includes two bike racks. Almost three months after moving in no bike room access though the bike room looks finished. Numerous emails to office and no answer. I understand it is a difficult period of time but that’s also why having a bike would be so useful.&nbsp; And this is while they already finished the storage spaces which they won’t provide access to while the bike room opens up.
