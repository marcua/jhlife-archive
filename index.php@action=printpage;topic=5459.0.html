				Tonight I was walking my dog. Suddenly and for no apparent reason another dog that was a good distance away made a quick lunge and wanted to attack my dog. Nothing new right? The other dog was able to get to us because it was on one of those retractable 25&#039; cord leashes which of course was unlocked, while the owner was busy daydreaming.<br /><br />Another time I was trying to get to an appointment and again there was a dog on one of those contraptions. The owner was at the curb, another daydreamer, while the dog was busy sniffing at the building&#039;s fence. It wasn&#039;t until I stopped and shot a look at the walker that they even became conscious. We shouldn&#039;t have to play hop scotch to get up the street.<br /><br />Fellow dog owners, <em>please,</em> you aren&#039;t doing your dog, yourself, or the public any favors by using those things. There are too many dangers that can happen in a split second. We&#039;re all better off, and safer, if you stick by the law which says no more than a 6&#039; leash.<br /><br />My dog walks on a 4&#039; strap which means he is close to me at all times and i think we&#039;re both happier for it. Your dog doesn&#039;t need to be wandering all over.<br /><br />Anyone else ever have a bad experience with one of those things?<br />

				The dog owners like these leashes for a reason. It allows their dogs to run all over the lawns of the private homes. i got into a argument with some jerk that was telling me my front lawn wasn&#039;t my property, but city property. What an A- -

				when we lived over there in the high 80&#039;s we experienced alot of leashless dogs. One particular lady had her dog run loose all the time and he was huge.&nbsp; When I confronted her (numerous times) she cursed at me. Then there was the boxer in the building on 85/34th that was always loose. Don&#039;t get me started on the poop either. Maybe we should get a poop patrol going.

				Given the amount of dogs that are visible in JH I have to think that the larger majority of dog owners are responsible people. Yes, there may be the occasional one who is not as conscientious as the rest. But you also find that people without dogs can be just as much unconcerned about others or the neighborhood evidenced by some of their habits. <br /><br />But I do have an issue with the dog-on-a-string leashes. And I wish that people would really think about things if they love their pets and the neighborhood at large.
