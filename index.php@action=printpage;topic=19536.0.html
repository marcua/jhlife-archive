				Hello, <br />I&#039;m looking around to find co-working spaces in Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Woodside. I&#039;m really tired of having to go all the way to Manhattan for something like that. I can work at home fine, but I need a change of scenery to be productive. Somebody on Instagram said that there&#039;s a co-working space near Wendy&#039;s (Broadway and 37th Road), but I&#039;m still investigating that. The Queensboro restaurant (80th Street and Northern Blvd) said that they turn into a co-working space during the day M-F (when the kitchen is closed) for a low fee (contact the restaurant for more details). Elmhurst library is nice, but it can get crowded and loud. Please share any ideas and info. Thank you!

				People have been talking about this for a while. I wish the Thai place next to Starbucks would have coworking during the day to take business away from them. What&#039;s this bway one?

				The Queensboro restaurant says: $100/month, access 9 am - 5 pm M-F. Coffee available. Not a bad deal.
