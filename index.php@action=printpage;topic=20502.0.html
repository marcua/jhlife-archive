				In the past couple weeks I’ve seen several co-ops listed and go into contract, even in the higher price points of $900k+. And a few of these deals happened FAST, like within two weeks of listing. It looks like some buyers know what they’re looking for and are eager to move in.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the country, real estate is going for 20%+ over pre-pandemic prices, while here in Jackson Heights it still seems a bit lower than before. Yet the nicer Jackson Heights co-ops have many of the benefits of suburbs (space, community feel, gardens) coupled with urban appeals.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, what’s the outlook? A new crop of young professionals moving in? Prices rising quickly as Jackson Heights takes on more of a Park Slope/Prospect Heights vibe? Yuppies spoiling the neighborhood? Omakase sushi? A subsequent drop in prices if many new sellers emerge?<br /><br />

				My own guess is that due to the pandemic, urban living (which is what we have here in Jackson Heights) will be out of fashion for a while.<br />

				We shall see, though I’m also hearing that deal activity has picked up, especially as NYC recovers more quickly than some other areas. I’m a believer that the same cultural forces that have been attracting people to cities for decades will rapidly overcome pandemic headwinds. <br /><br />Also, the suburbs have gotten so expensive so quickly — Jackson Heights becomes the not-so-hidden gem that can offer a best-of-both-worlds appeal. Who’s even leaving (and selling) given these possible dynamics?

				Some of the people leaving (and selling) are people who have lost their jobs :&#039;(<br /><br />Unemployment in NYC is still rising, it was 12.6% in January and 12.9% in March.<br /><br />By contrast it was 4.1% in 2018.

				&nbsp;One factor that might change the allure of the country, at least to the north, is that this past winter was brutal with tons of bad weather. People that were used to some mobility in the city were marooned by 2ft high snowfalls on occasion and some power outages. They seem deliriously happy to come back and go shopping and eat different foods. Let&#039;s see how it plays out this year.

				The only 2-3 bedroom/2-bath apartments that are selling in the $600s are in estate condition. Yes, they go in the high $600s if the buyer has to do a total gut renovation, as happened recently in my building.

				What makes you think anyone actually paid those prices? If so, it would be reflected on Streeteasy or on other public real estate records, and it seems that there is no record of sales at that price. The &quot;offered at&quot; price and what it sold for are two different things.

				The offering plan for Washington Heights was garbage I assume to get rid of renters. The price of my apartment almost doubled from the red herring to black book. They reduced somewhat later for insiders but it was still $150K over market. Plus as current resident your apartment isn&#039;t renovated, not that I&#039;d want it because they were converting nice one-bedrooms into small two-bedrooms. I took my buy-out and left.

				Washington Plaza seems like a different vibe compared to coops in the high-70s/low-80s closer to 34th Ave, both in surroundings and style. I assume the “bones” are befitting a rental vs. the quality of Towers, Chateau, or Hawthorne Court — all 3 of which have sold or gone into contract at $900k+ for a 3-4 bedroom flat. <br /><br />I have no clue what typical supply looks like, but this year, fewer than 10 of these larger apartments have hit the market, so owners must be sticking with the neighborhood.<br /><br />My 2c: for NYC professionals commuting less often that want great restaurants, a hip community, city access, and an easy trip to LGA for weekend getaways, this is the place. I’m just surprised they’re not putting their 1BR Manhattan shoe boxes on the market and moving here.
