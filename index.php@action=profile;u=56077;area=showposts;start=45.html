					^good thread to include this on. It looks like the Compromise Group (and now the OS Resisters), lobbied the 115 to shut down OS because of the parade. Except of course, the problem is that the OS Program was passed and signed in to law by the City Council and the mayor, so therefore the police department can&#039;t just modify OS whenever it wants (save for example a true emergency situation such as a chemical spill), and seems like they were reminded of that requiring an abrupt about face on their announced street closure (opening?) of 34 OS. <br /><br />My understanding is DoT runs the program and determines when to shut down Open Streets (like for plowing), and it looks like they aren&#039;t inclined to do so for parades.

					There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of opening up a commercial street. It&#039;s just a very different kind of open street. 34th Avenue, with all its trees and character, as well as proximity to many schools, is good for a Open Street with a focus on recreation and relaxation. 37th Avenue would be a good option for an OS that is focused on capitalism.&nbsp; The community seems to prefer an OS with a focus on recreation and relaxation.

					And just to be clear, here is what the Compromise petition consists of (holy cow, I can&#039;t believe someone posted they wanted it to only be run Memorial Day through Labor Day).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Some of the compromises that could make the situation better for everyone are:<br /><br />● Operating hours to be adjusted. The Open Streets have high activity hours, but for most of the day, they are not being used much. Sidewalks are always available, and with a bike lane, there should be no need for a two-sided avenue to be blocked. There are also certain hours of high vehicular congestion in the adjacent roads, that could be relieved by having 34th Ave. accessible.<br /><br />● Length of the Open Streets to be minimized. Most Open Streets are only a small fraction of what 34th Avenue is. This is a residential area, and determining which zones are used most, and only using those for the program, could make it better for others.<br /><br />● Merchants to not be allowed to operate on OS. They could be in a designated area, possibly a nearby park. They have been setting up in the median or in the street itself, the numbers of merchants grow more, and the road is supposed to be available for first responders, and official vehicles. This is a very important safety matter for our residents.<br /><br />● Social Activities made by volunteers to be limited to the parks for safety &amp; noise pollution reasons.<br /><br />● Avoid added noise pollution.<br /><br />● Local traffic to be allowed on one side of the avenue with flowing traffic to alleviate vehicular congestion &amp; be able to access the residents in the area.<br /><br />● Another survey to be conducted for a better understanding of how OS affects the residents of the avenue itself. They are the ones directly affected by this program and should have a say in it. This should be accompanied by a meeting with the DOT where residents can express their concerns.<br /><br />● A study to be made of the effects on property value &amp; for that information to be provided to residents.<br /><br />● Barriers to be within ADA code &amp; other safety regulations.<br /><br />● Program to ensure that Open Streets are going to be kept clean.<br /><br />● On parade dates suspending Open Streets to avoid mass congestion.<br /><br />● Inclement weather to be considered to suspend Open Streets due to lack of use.<br /><br />● Community involvement in decision-making, other than the coalition.<br /><br />● Volunteers do not take donations or benefit economically from OS (as they currently do). This includes no newsletters on the barriers. They should stay for DOT official information on OS only. No advertising of any sort.<br /><br />● For DOT or NYPD to handle the program in 34th Ave as the coalition has proven they do not have the best interest of the neighborhood, but those of their own organization. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Period!&quot;<br /><br />I think the criticism of Jacob White and other moderators of the 11372 group is fair. Little to no feedback is given to users and they mute critics of open streets for posting &quot;you are incorrect.&quot; Meanwhile, they ignore deliberate and constant trolling - physical threats, sealion tactics, constant rudeness by some users when others disagree with them. Community management is work, and part of the work is providing feedback to users so they can shape up. However, moderators can moderate their group how they would like, no matter how unfair and biased.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Compromise petition is a combination of: clearly stated goals (reduce the hours, shorten the length of OS), misinformation (vendors, the incorrect claim that volunteers are personally benefiting financially); common sense proposals the Compromise leaders seem to think they thought up yet what everyone, including the most ardent OS supporters have been advocating for (better barricades); proposals that make no sense (NYPD &amp; DOT to run the program. Hello! We had that as a pilot program in March 2020 and it didn&#039;t work! The Coalition came together to make OS work.) and specific design plans that may or may not be viable.<br /><br />A better call if you like Open Streets is this: <a href="https://www.34avelinearpark.com/petition-english" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.34avelinearpark.com/petition-english</a><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We support engaging with the community for design input.<br /><br />We support:<br /><br />creating the maximum amount of new green space<br /><br />maximizing safety<br /><br />providing access to existing driveways and garages<br /><br />facilitating access for emergency vehicles, delivery, city services, and school buses<br /><br />accommodating people with disabilities, including Access-A-Ride&nbsp; <br /><br />expanding space for public schools to use for programs<br /><br />reducing conflict between pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I have no doubt you know this. Therefore, it seems quite apparent you are insincere and arguing in bad faith.

					^^CB3 announced on social media that its site was going to be down for maintenance. Which holy cow, I hope they get can save it from the space/time anomaly that has kept it stuck in 1996. This is a pretty good time to do it since they are on a break for the summer.<br /><br />Sounds like you aren&#039;t aware of the different committee meetings you can attend (transportation, education, land use, economic development, immigrant affairs) in addition to the monthly meeting (which is where they deal with liquor licenses.) And BTW, for the businesses applying for a liquor license, getting one is a big deal and a delay with the community board is a problem.<br /><br />Maybe you should apply to CB3 and see about starting a committee specifically about homeless issues (if there isn&#039;t already one).

					^And I think the market had already gone soft before the pandemic started. I know there was a point where our apartment had doubled in value over a three year period, and then the market softened and likely value on the market was about 20% less. And I&#039;m talking actual sales prices not listing prices. I keep on top of it because I like having an idea of my net worth (on paper), and toy with the idea of selling and moving somewhere else.
