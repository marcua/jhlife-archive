			Hello,<br /><br />Does anyone happen to know where I could donate some used books and clothing in the neighborhood?<br /><br />(The Salvation Army down the street from me on 35th Ave. has a big sign that reads &quot;No more clothes!&quot;)<br /><br />thanks!

			The Jewish Center on 77th St accepts clothing donations and maybe other stuff as well.&nbsp; At the moment they are not accepting summer clothes.&nbsp; They are open for donations at least on M,T W from 10:30 to around 4pm but you may want to call them to verify before you lug all your stuff all the way over there.<br />718-429-1150

			The Salvation Army has an erroneous sign posted.&nbsp; They do accept clothing, not books, but yes clothing.<br /><br />The Jewish Center is the most community beneficial place to donate.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, call and check their hours, remember their holidays begin soon after Thanksgiving.&nbsp; <br /><br />Books, huhn, well, will be stopping by the Center after Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Thanks for your donation to the JH reading community....

			I also have a lot of books to donate. I heard that hospitals and libraries will take them. Has anyone tried this at the JH area hospitals or the library? What was the result?

			<br />
			Oh, yes, the Library will take books.<br /><br />They have cartons ready for you, right near the staircase, right side of the library,&nbsp; and will then ship your donation to Amazon where your books are sold for the Library.<br /><br />And, Elmhurst Hospital has a rolling book cart for parients and could probably use books.<br /><br />Your choice....<br /><br />Sometimes, on your way to the Jewish Center and on the right weekday, you&#039;ll find the bookseller stationed in front of the 76th Street Met.&nbsp; <br />
