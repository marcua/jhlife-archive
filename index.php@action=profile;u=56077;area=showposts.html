It&#039;s marketing and this is not information a supermarket or restaurant or Trader Joe&#039;s collects or posts. If I understand it correctly, this is just information Google tracks through smartphones and can tell people searching for a business what foot traffic is typically like (this would the same sort of tracking that lets Google Maps suggest an alternate route when there&#039;s an accident and slow down on a highway). <br /><br />I have a Google business account, a Google business profile, but my business isn&#039;t retail so I don&#039;t bother with any of that kind of stuff. I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a fee a business has to pay to Google for displaying that info, if it&#039;s offered as a way to satisfy users, or just given as free a la Google Analytics since it provides a ton of information to Google.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can be obtained from Google business, that is unless you believe that 34th Ave is always consistently busy all 13hours and all 7 days of the week and there is no need for an analytics</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think DoT has created Google Business accounts for specific Open Streets, nor would I expect them to. Also, I don&#039;t think foot traffic is consistent on 34 OS, because I understand how traffic works. It&#039;s just much higher than what the most rabid critics claim (which is it&#039;s mostly empty most of the time, no matter the season).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Have you seen the MTA Data? Useless and ineptly collected is all I have to say. We need outside professionals who have done this before and who will take time to really understand the neighborhood and avoid random closures and placements as the MTA has done. Real facts please!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes I have, and if you have, I am puzzled why you keep asking where the data is. Seems like a pretty disingenuous questions since what it seems like what you really mean &quot;I&#039;ve seen their data, and I just don&#039;t believe it.&quot;

					^^Well, it should. You specifically asked:<br /><br /><strong>If <em>people who like OS</em> are so opposed to the barriers, why don&#039;t <em>they</em> try other solutions?</strong><br /><br />The answer is that the people who like OS don&#039;t have the authority to try other solutions. Or were up unclear of the grammar of your question?<br /><br />Turning to DoT, there&#039;s no mystery why that city agency has taken so long on this. There was an election in November for mayor. and city council. Undoubtedly, DoT decided to take it&#039;s sweet time to wait to see what the next mayoral administration and city council was going to be like. It also gave DoT time collect data on usage. They&#039;ve presented one possible solution - the diverters - and you&#039;re still here complaining about why there aren&#039;t other solutions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In other areas, the OS have been cast aside by unhappy neighbors at a high rate and keeping this status without significant compromise seems delusional at best.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />However, in this area there is high community support. One reason our OS is so successful is because of the well-managed, large, and committed group of volunteers willing to come out twice a day and move barricades. For almost a year and a half.

The city runs the program via DoT, which partners with local groups to implement the program. Any changes to the barricades, such as the diverters the DoT presented to CB3 with an underwhelming response from pro- and anti- OS groups, has to come from DoT since this a program managed by DoT.<br /><br />Does that clear things up for you about why people aren&#039;t just running around willy-nilly trying other solutions to a city program they aren&#039;t in charge of?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The dog pee and poo greenway that used to be the median is a festering problem and no one, repeat no one, should be gardening in there any longer.

Did you by any chance notice the signs the 34th Avenue Coalition put up at the patches where people had planted food notifying that either the DoT or Parks Department had authorized&nbsp; the Coalition to take over gardening on the median, that food grown in the median was unsafe, and inviting the gardener to work with the Coalition? Also, I think the issue is less about pet waste than it is about metals in the dirt making the food grown there unsafe to eat.<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And many residents would welcome a police/security presence on the ave, especially in the dark evenings when JH has traditionally had an uptick in crime.

Where do you think the money for security would come from? Do you really want either additional man hours from the NYPD to cover 34th Avenue (which means an increase in budget) or resources diverted from other areas to provide more foot patrol hours on 34th Avenue? (And why? Nobody is screaming about increased crime along 34th Avenue).

Keep everything as is and in fact, give me more.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like you&#039;ve talked to a very limited and skewed sample then. People who support OS want things changed. There&#039;s a wide variety of opinion about how to change it, but the one thing EVERYONE agrees on is that the barricades are not a good permanent solution.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Many of the 34th Ave residents are pleading for fewer hours, especially in the winter when they have to navigate the streets by foot, bikes, bus or vehicles and it&#039;s dangerous. But come hell or high water, others want the street closures untouched. Is this fair and/or advocating for change?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like you&#039;re talking to a small and skewed sample. If the residents of 34th Ave really dislike it so much, you&#039;d think the OS opposition candidate in the general election for city council, which is the elected official at the city level that will have the biggest impact of 34 OS, would have gotten more than a couple hundreds votes.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For those residents on 34th ave, the outrageous closure time of not 4-6 or 8 hours but 13 HOURS of barricades to move and it&#039;s truly a hardship.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s why instead of uselessly moaning and groaning on a BB that&#039;s going to shut down in a few weeks, it&#039;s better to be involved with DoT and the monthly community board meetings.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Voter turnout is so low here- I believe the last election was under 20%- that its a useless indicator of how the neighborhood feels about an issue, Open Streets or otherwise.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anti-OS groups spent months going in the buildings along 34th Avenue to try and get people involved in their campaign against OS. They printed flyers and put them up in lobbies, stuck them under doors, held meetings in buildings, and one coop board president even talked openly at a CB3 meeting about going door-to-door to talk to people (which is likely a violation of his coop&#039;s occupancy agreement, but exactly who do you complain to when it&#039;s the board president doing it?). With so few people even bothering to register a protest vote in favor of the anti-OS candidate, it really says a lot about how little opposition there really is not only in the neighborhood, but also amongst residents of 34th Ave.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It&#039;s only JH that got stuck with 13hrs a day closures, 7 days a week far outpacing anything resembling Open Streets in all of NYC. Why just us?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As DOT noted at the CB3 meeting where they presented their initial plan, our neighborhood has high volunteer capacity. There&#039;s a well managed, large and dedicated group of people willing to move barricades. There&#039;s also a lot of people organizing events on OS.

					^Of course everyone doesn&#039;t agree about 34 OS. But the DoT having collected pedestrian counts at multiple times of days&nbsp; over the course of months which show high usage doesn&#039;t become less of a fact because you don&#039;t like where they placed a bike rack or a DoT employee misspoke about bike lanes in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Getting riled up over a program that the community has embraced - and let&#039;s remember the candidate for City Council who ran openly against 34 OS garnered all of a few hundred votes - really doesn&#039;t seem like a good use of anyone&#039;s energy. Better to advocate for changes to OS that will improve it to make it better (like a plan that eliminates the need for barricades to keep pedestrians protected and directs electric bikes and scooters being used for transportation purposes to streets with bike lanes).

					Indeed, this forum post perfectly encapsulates the futility. OP didn&#039;t ask &quot;Can anyone please answer why the ave is<br />closed when it is pitch black out at 7:00 on a cold night?&quot; because OP really wanted an answer for why. OP already knows why. It&#039;s just that OP disagrees with the answer, and instead of wanting to come to some kind of understanding other people&#039;s POV on the subject, just wants an opportunity to tell the people who answer they are wrong.<br /><br />It&#039;s transparent, and is an example of a bad faith discussion.

Really?? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The DoT does.

Why is there so much resistance here to say that some of time, and I repeat, some of the time, it&#039;s just not busy and in fact there are a number of times it is empty. Fact. Let the streets cameras show us the results, please. What is there to hide?

Considering that the opponents of 34 OS don&#039;t understand traffic pattern ebbs and flows, falsely claim from seeing one empty block means that the entire 1.2 mile stretch is empty, moan and groan that the street is empty during bad weather and why oh why can&#039;t the hours be adjusted on a hour by hour basis according to Doppler radar, and consistently fail to see the people actually on the street (with ridiculous pictures posted online claiming the street is &quot;empty&quot; when you can see pedestrians on OS in the picture), I&#039;ll take DoT&#039;s data over false narratives any day.

					good luck with it. I&#039;ve never understood the &quot;don&#039;t call a troll a troll&quot; rule though. <br /><br />I also think the advice provided on this forum, though sometimes overlooked by the admins, of recognizing that tone is often hard to read in text only exchanges and your own bias may have to more to do with interpretation of tone than anything the person actually wrote.

					^look up recent sales in the Allendale or other coops. Realtor.com has info on recent sales that is easy to access. From there you can determine what 20% down would be today ($60K for a $300K apartment for example). Plus a coop is going to want to see you have about 6 months or more in savings after closing to cover maintenance + mortgage in an emergency. <br /><br />The first step towards home ownership is saving for a down payment. There&#039;s no point in doing anything other than that if you don&#039;t have the $$, other than looking at apartment listings to get a sense of the market. It took me about a decade as a single person to save enough for a down payment after my student loans were paid off. So if you still need to save, figure out ways to reduce your expenses - getting roommates helped me save a lot of money. If you are a two income household, saving for the down payment will probably take less time (but you&#039;ll also probably want a bigger place. I know I saw smaller apartments I would have been fine with as a single, but seemed a bit tight when I began looking because I was married at that time).

OS is intended for leisure, not fast commuting. Anyone who wants to bike to get somewhere quickly can head on over to the bike lanes north of Northern Blvd. They are on a bike, so it won&#039;t take them long to get over there. The eBike delivery guys who use 34th Ave should slow it down or ride in regular traffic. Most those eBikes are practically motorcycles anyway. It would be nice to see the 115 out there regularly to issue warnings. I don&#039;t really want those delivery guys to get a ticket, but I would like them to get the message that they could eventually get one if they continue to break the 5 MPH rule.
