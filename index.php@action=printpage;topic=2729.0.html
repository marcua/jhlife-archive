				Here&#039;s an article from the Daily News about a guy making the most of his 210 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan.&nbsp; I&#039;d say that&#039;s he definitely space challenged.<br /><br />He lives big in tiny digs: West Sider wins award for smallest, coolest pad (http://www.nydailynews.com/real_estate/2009/05/12/2009-05-12_coolest_smallest_apartment_in_city.html)

				I had to laugh becuase I pay exaclty the same for rent ($1,550) and I have a bedroom with a door, a huge living room, a nice kitchen, big windows, a modern bathroom, hardwood floors, room for guests, a cool neighborhood, a 17 minute commute to midtown, and, best of all, big lion statues guarding the entrance to my building.&nbsp; I lived in Manhattan for 3 years and then finally got wise and moved to Jackson Heights.

				Here another story of a tiny apartment in Manhattan.&nbsp; This one is only 175 sq. ft. and was purchased recently for $150,000.<br /><br />Cozy-crazy couple makes tight all right in the city&#039;s tiniest studio (http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cozy_crazy_couple_makes_tight_studio_R15ToNFTaJE3c17zkw4efP)

				I guess it&#039;s great if it works for them, but there are a bunch of things in that article that seem really strange to me beyond just having a small apartment.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand their system of picking up their work clothes on their way into work every day.&nbsp; Is this because they don&#039;t have a closet at home?&nbsp; I just can&#039;t really get how that would work.&nbsp; Also, the idea of not owning a trash can and having to go out to the trash chute every time you want to thrown away anything, like a tissue, is weird.&nbsp; The whole thing is weird....but hey, a chacun son gout!

				This is from a few years ago - it&#039;s about the Apartmenttherapy couple&#039;s rented 265 sq foot apartment that they renovated and continued to live in with their new baby.&nbsp; Wonder if they moved out when the baby became a toddler!<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/garden/16baby.html

				This couple has only 50 square feet more than the couple in Morningside Heights, who keep their clothing at the dry cleaner and don&#039;t have a trash can. &nbsp;I wonder why it seems like so much more than an extra 50 square feet. http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/02/realestate/20070902_HABI_SLIDESHOW_index.html

				It probably has do with perspective and camera angles.&nbsp; This is commonly used when photographing apartments that are for sale.

				i could never ever do that.... :o<br /><br />i grew up in a 700 square foot space with my mom and grandma and never really knew it was cramped because everyone else around had the same sort of living environment. when i got into my older teens and broadened my horizons, i made a promise to myself that i would always value space above all else. so when i moved out on my own at 17-18, i lived in a series of really big places in really bad areas -- a huge three bedroom off avenue D in the far far east village, a three bedroom in bed-stuy, a really big two bedroom right on newtown creek in a crappy part of greenpoint. <br /><br />i&#039;ve been fortunate enough to maintain big spaces since, although i&#039;ve been in nicer realms -- astoria, then two places in JH. i cannot imagine cutting my living space by 80 percent for the &quot;convenience&quot; of living in a part of manhattan that&#039;s as far from midtown as we are!

				More of NYC&#039;s smallest living quarters from the Post - these are 55 sq ft, 90 sq ft and 105 sq ft. &nbsp;One woman&#039;s kitchen sink is so small, she has to do her dishes in the shower and one guy&#039;s shower is so small, he can&#039;t turn around in it.<br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/small_price_to_pay_yk3QVpgdWYWTBnEhJ0QPXN

				NY Time&#039;s Home and Garden section did a feature on a 178 sq foot apartment in Clinton Hill<br /><br />A Roomy 178 Square Feet &nbsp;(http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/garden/11location.html)<br /><br />THE tins of seasoning on top of Zach Motlâ€™s refrigerator â€” Old Bay, Hungarian paprika, Madras curry powder â€” are for show only, chosen for their graphic punch and nifty typefaces. Living in a room thatâ€™s only 178 square feet, you donâ€™t want to cook much, Mr. Motl said; itâ€™s just too odoriferous. He once made French onion soup, and the apartment smelled for four days. â€œIt was gross,â€ he said. <br /><br />Mr. Motl, a junior designer at Robert Couturier &amp; Associates, has a sailorâ€™s sense of thrift and handiness. More Photos Â» <br />But Mr. Motl, 25, has made the most of this studio apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, which he rents for $944 a month, and has outfitted for about $2,500 in the three years since he moved to New York City. He has hewed to the old decorating dictum that says the more stuff you put in a room (albeit artfully arranged stuff), the bigger it seems. More really is more. <br /><br />Click link for full article and slide show
