				After getting our ducks in order, having that potential of a 30% down payment and 2 years liquid backup,&nbsp; we are finally ready to buy a place.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been renting in the JH for some years now (me since 2010, my wife since 2007) and happily decided that the JH is where we can see ourselves staying for the long haul.<br /><br />When interviewing a broker (surely we shine a greenish hue) we were presented with the concept of a buyer broker.&nbsp; Now as much as I wouldn&#039;t want to directly pay a commish as a buyer, I can see the merit by having an experienced player being my specific advocate in what will be the biggest purchase of my life (unless my hip hop career finally takes off).&nbsp; So I wanted to ask if anyone on the boards has had experience using a buyer broker.&nbsp; What are the pros and cons?&nbsp; What should a good BB be willing to do for me?&nbsp; Is it unreasonable of me to ask for a BB to present a wealth of data showing price activities, maintenance comparisons and reports on how well (or unwell) certain co-op boards swab their ships?&nbsp; Does having one open up more pocket listings or close them off?&nbsp; What about with properties that will not co-broke?&nbsp; Is my paying their commission open those up, or does the exclusivity agreement make it so that I am effectively shut out of such?&nbsp; Will not having one just result in broker who would would be willing to steer us to a low grade choice just to quickly make their buck?&nbsp; <br /><br />And as a side bar, we went to an imprompt showing at Linden Court.&nbsp; The realtor showing mentioned a special 30 year assessment of 330, to be on top of the 760 maintenance and said it was &quot;pretty much normal&quot; on a 2 bedroom.&nbsp; Now I just smiled and nodded as my BS bells chimed away, but I wondered if seriously high special assessments an occupational hazard in venerable developments like Linden Court?&nbsp; Such a shame should it be if such was so, as they are so pretty and I always thought being forced to take the stairs was a window to a longer life.&nbsp; <br /><br />And by the way, should you know of a good 2BR or corpulent JR4.....&nbsp; ;)

				Hello.&nbsp; I wrote the history of our neighborhood and publish a quarterly report on all residential real estate transactions in our zip code.&nbsp; I am also an associate broker at Beaudoin Realty Group.&nbsp; As such, I know the inventory and I can explain the purchase process with and without being represented by a broker.&nbsp; Just send me an email.<br /><br />Dan Karatzas<br />Daniel@beaudoinrealty.com<br />

				Who in JH requires 30% and 2yrs liquid? (Not that it&#039;s a bad thing to have that kind of resources). Those sound like manhattan/hot-brooklyn requirements.....<br /><br />Most co-ops I&#039;ve seen require 20% - occasionaly 25% -&nbsp; and stable income.

				Ummm....a <strong>30 year</strong> assessment of $330/mth is &quot;pretty normal?&quot;&nbsp; More like pretty ridiculous.&nbsp; Wonder what happened there.&nbsp; Usually when there are assessments, they don&#039;t last more than a few months and they are for addressing specific issues/projects.&nbsp; I know a friend who is going to sell her 2bdrm 2bth (at the Windsor) soon.&nbsp; She lives on the first floor.&nbsp; Not sure if that is a deal breaker for you.&nbsp; If not, I can ask her when she plans to list it.

				that seems like a wildly over the top assessment. i recently went through an 18 month assessment of roughly the same amount, which was bad enough....

				My understanding as a layperson is that buyers brokers are not commonly used here.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure of the reason.&nbsp; I think you&#039;d be best off contacting local expert sellling realtors that have a history of selling in buildings with good financials and know the neighborhood because they are long-time residents.&nbsp; I think there are probably several realtors like this.&nbsp; Ask around, or ask people to send you a direct message on here with a recommendation.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did a little quick Googling and found this article on the issue of buyers&#039; brokers.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there are other articles as well.<br />http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/buyers-brokers-struggle-in-sellers-market/<br /><br />http://www.brownstoner.com/forum-archive/2008/01/what-if-i-reall/<br /><br />

				I&#039;d strongly recommend Jeff Putterman at&nbsp; Beaudoin Realty Group http://beaudoinrealtor.com/category/jeffrey-putterman/ (http://beaudoinrealtor.com/category/jeffrey-putterman/). He&#039;s been helping us with our purchase (we&#039;re just about to close) and he&#039;s been terrific from start to finish: straightforward, incredibly responsive, and very clearly on our side the whole time. He&#039;s also very funny and full of great stories. I can&#039;t imagine having bought in JH without him.<br /><br />And to speak to one of your questions: there are probably people who won&#039;t co-broke if you go with a buyer&#039;s broker but . . . I&#039;m guessing those aren&#039;t properties you want to see. They sound pretty darn shady.<br /><br />Certainly everything we wanted to see (and we were interested in what seemed to be pretty hot places) Jeff got us into. And he usually knew the broker and seemed to have a good rapport with them.

				I don&#039;t think it is needed at all in JH. <br /><br />You should narrow down the buildings that you want to live in to a small handful, and determine the exact type of apartments you are interested in, even down to the line in each building. <br /><br />Your next step is to stake out the buildings, talk to the residents expressing your interest, get #&#039;s of the management companies and express your interest to them, and when and where possible, get friendly with someone on the Board of each building who can give you a heads up when what you are looking is coming to market.<br /><br />Lastly, be prepared to wait and move quickly if your needs are specific (i.e. you want a two+ bed, two bath, 1200+ sq. ft. above the fourth floor, garden facing, etc.).
