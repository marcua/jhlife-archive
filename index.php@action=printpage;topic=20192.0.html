				Does anyone know of a coat donation (or clothing in general) drive going on anywhere in the neighborhood? I know the green market on Sundays is no longer accepting clothing, and I&#039;d like to especially donate some coats taking up space in my apartment, without having to take them on the subway somewhere. Thanks!

				I saw on Queens Liberation Project&#039;s Instagram page that there&#039;s a Coats for Queens drive starting today. None of their 5 drop-off bins are in Jackson Heights, but thought I&#039;d share the info anyway. Hopefully there&#039;ll be some drop-off locations in our neighborhood eventually, through QLP or other orgs.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to the Instagram post: https://www.instagram.com/p/CGd16nhlzof/<br /><br />Sunnyside: Sugar Room - 4421 Queens Blvd<br />LIC: AT&amp;T LIC - 4632 Vernon Blvd<br />LIC: Bella Via - 4746 Vernon Blvd<br />Astoria: First Reformed Church of Astoria - 2726 12th St<br />Queens Village: Hollis Deli - 20602 Hollis Ave<br /><br />I did see one comment that a person couldn&#039;t find one of the bins today, so it might be worth calling the location(s) to confirm the bin is there before hauling your coats there. I&#039;m guessing you can also email QLP at queensliberationproject@protonmail.com to confirm.<br />
