				Hello,<br /><br />Thinking of moving to JH.&nbsp; Especially in Wash. Plaza.&nbsp; However, it says no pets alllowed.&nbsp; I talked to a Real Estate Agent, and she said that that really only pertains to dogs, and that a cat would be fine.&nbsp; We have 1 cat, and no dogs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is this something I should worry about?&nbsp; Do others you know have cats in this building or other buildings with these same parameters?<br /><br />Thanks!

				It usually means dogs BUT you should ask because if you have a House Rule that says &quot;no pets&quot;, legally you&#039;re breaking the Rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, I know people sneak cats in and there&#039;s a law about grandfathering in animals that live somewhere for, I think 90 days, but it would probably be less stressful to you to know in advance you&#039;re not doing anything wrong.&nbsp; If you have an attorney for the closing, ask him/her what they think.&nbsp; Or ask the Super of the building if cats are allowed.&nbsp;

				Washington Plaza is a rental building, so the situation is a bit different.&nbsp; I lived there previously, and asked about this because I had a parakeet at the time.&nbsp; I was told that caged animals were exempt.&nbsp; But the lease simply said that no pets are permitted.&nbsp; So I think there&#039;s a good chance there&#039;s an unwritten &quot;quiet animal that doesn&#039;t need to be walked&quot; exemption as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;d advise asking about it, though.

				Oh I didn&#039;t realize the place was a rental.&nbsp; I agree with todd: don&#039;t ask.&nbsp; Just sneak the cat in.&nbsp; I doubt you&#039;d get evicted over that.&nbsp; It&#039;s too costly going to court.&nbsp; I thought it was a co-op.

				My parents live in a rent stabilized building in Woodside that has a no pets policy.&nbsp; They once babysat my sister&#039;s cat for a few weeks while she was away.&nbsp; Within 3 weeks of the cat being in the apartment, the superintendent managed to find out because he had to enter to repair a leak.&nbsp; While my parents did attempt to hide the cat from him, he was able to hear the cat&#039;s meow.&nbsp; To make a long story short...he ratted on my parents and the following week they received a letter from the landlord&#039;s attorney stating that they had 30 days to get rid of the cat.&nbsp; The story has a nice ending though because after all, the cat was picked-up by my sister the following week.&nbsp; I guess what it all boils down to is how flexible your landlord is.

				I couldn&#039;t really remember the exact rules of the 90 day law.&nbsp; You may be right.&nbsp; I honestly can&#039;t remember.&nbsp; I just know that something to that effect exists.
