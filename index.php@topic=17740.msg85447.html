								<div class="inner" id="msg_85399">My family just received a letter from our management company stating we are in violations of house rules and are being fined $250. The violation is for &quot;excessive loud noises after-hours (house rules 10:00pm - 9:00am quiet hours), after we have been warned in the past&quot;. We are very confused to these loud noises since we are in bed by 9pm and our cat gets put in the bathroom (we spoke with out neighbors downstairs and agreed to put our cat in the bathroom at night, and in the morning when we&#039;re not home in the bedroom). My husband is up around 530am and gets dressed quietly, my daughter gets up at 7 and are quiet when getting ready. She has to sit (usually watching tv) until it is time to leave for school at 7:45am. <br /><br />Our apartment has thick wall to wall carpeting (we put it down carpet when we received our first notice); the neighbors banged on the ceiling when the company came to take measurements. They banged on our ceiling when the workers just walked across the room to put their equipment down. The neighbor told us he can hear us going to the bathroom at night (we&#039;re a family of 3 with a 5 year old). We are told, one of the complaints is,items are being dropped at all hours.&nbsp; They called the maintenance office one night so they can check on the noise, but my daughter and I were sleeping (8:30pm) and the maintenance guy was very apologetic for waking us. <br /><br />The building is hollow between the floor and ceiling. There is no insulation between the walls and yes we can hear our downstairs neighbor when they talk, watch TV, close doors, listen to music too. We can also hear other neighbors in the hallway, the elevator going up and down, trash being thrown down the compactor chute.but these are what we believe are normal living noise and we hear it because we live in an apartment building. <br /><br />My personal opinion, we are very quiet neighbors. We do not wear shoes in the house, my daughter is not allowed to dance, jump, nor make any noise. We reprimand her when she does. Things get dropped because we&#039;re clumsy humans. We go to bed early (before quiet hours), we do not have any guests over due to the fear of &quot;disturbing&quot; our neighbor and getting more notices from management. I&#039;m at a loss, we purchased this apartment and now we feel we are being harassed by the renters below us. <br /><br />What would you consider to be &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;? Does any one have any opinions on what we can do? </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85403">I have no idea really what you can do but that sounds like a nightmarish situation. The people below you are being totally unreasonable and somehow the management is just going along with them--that&#039;s what it sounds like to me. You are right that living in an apartment requires that you get used to hearing your neighbors in the course of daily life. And some buildings are better than others at muffling the sounds. Nevertheless, you will hear your neighbors and that&#039;s just inevitable.<br /><br />We lived in another coop in a different neighborhood for 23 years and raised our child there. Only once, when a new family moved in below us, did we have complaints and requests that our child not ever run or jump or call out loudly, because their grown daughter needed to sleep till noon--they said that. We placated them somehow, though I was never able or willing to force my child to tiptoe and whisper 24 hours a day. Nor force myself and my husband to do that. Oh and I forgot--a different downstairs neighbor, then childless but now with twins, gave my daughter a pair of slippers--their subtle way of asking for quiet! <br /><br />Sounds like your building aggravates the situation because the walls are thin, etc. If I were you, I&#039;d consult a lawyer to find out what your options are. And I would even consider selling and moving to get away from a very unpleasant situation. Sorry I don&#039;t have specific advice or information about your rights.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85406">Unfortunately I have two friends that have been in your exact situation with a downstairs neighbor in a coop. In one case, they eventually reached an angry impasse with the neighbors (coop didn&#039;t really get involved beyond requiring rugs), and then our friends moved away. It was very uncomfortable for them. The other case is still ongoing...involves downstairs neighbors with likely mental problems (e.g. claims of all sorts of noises at all times). Progress is being made through mediation and opening some lines of communication, but friends are also thinking of moving to get away from the nonsense.<br /><br />Unfortunately, something like 80% of apartments in NYC that one can purchase (maybe even higher in JH) are coops. Once we move we&#039;re never living in a coop again...the boards are staffed with volunteers that range from competent or even skilled at management to petty tyrants that enjoy any little power they can grasp. There are a lot of board members in between that can be disinterested, incompetent, and prone to all sorts of small-time corruption. Your only remedy is to vote them out. Have you talked to your board? Sounds like most of the communication has been with management.<br /><br />I would certainly challenge that fine. Find a lawyer that specializes in real estate / coops (not one of the bottom feeders that advertises $100 divorces and traffic ticket fixing). What did the board or management company do besides warning you? Did they confirm this noise? It sounds like they only sent somebody one time who found nothing.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85407">QueensGal, I could have written your post verbatim. My downstairs neighbor made my family life difficult and my children less happy-go-lucky. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have time now to go into what all I did to appease her and the coop board president, who sided with her every whim. Just want to point out that when she moved in, they had illegal work done (a prior board) that removed an inner wall which might contribute to a loss in sound absorption as well as development of structural malformations. It cost me a lot of money. To this day she still has no carpeting or made any improvement to try to alleviate <em>her </em>problem. <br /><br />I was told time and again that there is no problem until there are complaints, and rather than deal with the actual facts, boards simply employ harassment methods until the &quot;rules&quot; are applied and exhausted. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85410">I&#039;d start with a request for clarification from the coop. It is not reasonable to be expected to correct something you&#039;re unaware of. It is likely, however, that the coop would not provide details, out of concern for the person who complained. If that happens, you may follow up with a list of the noise abatement measures you&#039;ve taken (e.g., carpeting, cat, etc.), and tell them that you&#039;d consider commercially reasonable suggestions (if you will, in fact) -- that way you put it on them to figure out a possible solution. <br /><br />The truth is that noise carries, especially in concrete buildings and those with thin walls, and so it&#039;s often about managing expectations. You can&#039;t levitate but you can avoid, say, playing the drums at midnight, and I think that&#039;s the key here. <br /><br />Hope this helps, and good luck.&nbsp; </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85412">I can&#039;t genuinely understand the situation until I&#039;ve actually been in your shoes. However, I&#039;m going to offer a suggestion that may - or may not - help. In the past, I&#039;ve been the downstairs neighbor that has been affected by noise. I&#039;ve approached the neighbor, and I&#039;ve also complained to management. However, in the end, I realized you can&#039;t change people, and so I purchased earplugs and noise reduction earmuffs. I wore them 24/7 until the end of my lease and moved out. And since then, I decided I will never live below the top floor of a building for the rest of my lifetime. <br /><br />Since you mentioned that the neighbor complained about a worker walking across a room, you guys going to the bathroom and items being dropped, the issue could be with walking. The neighbor that created the noise above me struck his heels on the floor as he walked. So whenever he walked across his floors, it was like a loud, banging noise. It sounded like a&nbsp; drum during Chinese New Year. In contrast, my ex and I naturally walked on the front of our feet. We asked our downstairs neighbor if they could hear us, and they said no, and I believe the main reason is that our walking style is whisper-quiet, as if we weren&#039;t even in the apartment at all. <br /><br />Since you&#039;re in a a seemingly longer-term situation, I would try to see if using a lighter walking style - walking on the front of your feet - would help. That or perhaps wearing a pair of very soft slippers that could muffle the noise. It also could be that your neighbor is unreasonable though, and in that case, honestly, I would do as I do. I would not plan to stay there long-term because it&#039;s stressful to live a daily life with a neighbor that harasses you. </div>

The violation is for &quot;excessive loud noises after-hours (house rules 10:00pm - 9:00am quiet hours), after we have been warned in the past&quot;. We are very confused to these loud noises since we are in bed by 9pm and our cat gets put in the bathroom (we spoke with out neighbors downstairs and agreed to put our cat in the bathroom at night, and in the morning when we&#039;re not home in the bedroom). My husband is up around 530am and gets dressed quietly, my daughter gets up at 7 and are quiet when getting ready. She has to sit (usually watching tv) until it is time to leave for school at 7:45am. <br /><br />Our apartment has thick wall to wall carpeting (we put it down carpet when we received our first notice); the neighbors banged on the ceiling when the company came to take measurements. They banged on our ceiling when the workers just walked across the room to put their equipment down. The neighbor told us he can hear us going to the bathroom at night (we&#039;re a family of 3 with a 5 year old). We are told, one of the complaints is,items are being dropped at all hours.&nbsp; They called the maintenance office one night so they can check on the noise, but my daughter and I were sleeping (8:30pm) and the maintenance guy was very apologetic for waking us. <br /><br />The building is hollow between the floor and ceiling. There is no insulation between the walls and yes we can hear our downstairs neighbor when they talk, watch TV, close doors, listen to music too. We can also hear other neighbors in the hallway, the elevator going up and down, trash being thrown down the compactor chute.but these are what we believe are normal living noise and we hear it because we live in an apartment building. <br /><br />My personal opinion, we are very quiet neighbors. We do not wear shoes in the house, my daughter is not allowed to dance, jump, nor make any noise. We reprimand her when she does. Things get dropped because we&#039;re clumsy humans. We go to bed early (before quiet hours), we do not have any guests over due to the fear of &quot;disturbing&quot; our neighbor and getting more notices from management. I&#039;m at a loss, we purchased this apartment and now we feel we are being harassed by the renters below us. <br /><br />What would you consider to be &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;? Does any one have any opinions on what we can do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm, do you happen to have a carpet pad under your carpet?&nbsp; If not, you may want to look into having a thick one installed that may reduce noise.</div>

The violation is for &quot;excessive loud noises after-hours (house rules 10:00pm - 9:00am quiet hours), after we have been warned in the past&quot;. We are very confused to these loud noises since we are in bed by 9pm and our cat gets put in the bathroom (we spoke with out neighbors downstairs and agreed to put our cat in the bathroom at night, and in the morning when we&#039;re not home in the bedroom). My husband is up around 530am and gets dressed quietly, my daughter gets up at 7 and are quiet when getting ready. She has to sit (usually watching tv) until it is time to leave for school at 7:45am. <br /><br />Our apartment has thick wall to wall carpeting (we put it down carpet when we received our first notice); the neighbors banged on the ceiling when the company came to take measurements. They banged on our ceiling when the workers just walked across the room to put their equipment down. The neighbor told us he can hear us going to the bathroom at night (we&#039;re a family of 3 with a 5 year old). We are told, one of the complaints is,items are being dropped at all hours.&nbsp; They called the maintenance office one night so they can check on the noise, but my daughter and I were sleeping (8:30pm) and the maintenance guy was very apologetic for waking us. <br /><br />The building is hollow between the floor and ceiling. There is no insulation between the walls and yes we can hear our downstairs neighbor when they talk, watch TV, close doors, listen to music too. We can also hear other neighbors in the hallway, the elevator going up and down, trash being thrown down the compactor chute.but these are what we believe are normal living noise and we hear it because we live in an apartment building. <br /><br />My personal opinion, we are very quiet neighbors. We do not wear shoes in the house, my daughter is not allowed to dance, jump, nor make any noise. We reprimand her when she does. Things get dropped because we&#039;re clumsy humans. We go to bed early (before quiet hours), we do not have any guests over due to the fear of &quot;disturbing&quot; our neighbor and getting more notices from management. I&#039;m at a loss, we purchased this apartment and now we feel we are being harassed by the renters below us. <br /><br />What would you consider to be &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;? Does any one have any opinions on what we can do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm, do you happen to have a carpet pad under your carpet?&nbsp; If not, you may want to look into having a thick one installed that may reduce noise.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We purchased the extra thick padding and the carpet is also thick plush to help with sound. We consulted with the carpet company about noise and which would be best for our situation. The maintenance guys commented on how thick the padding was when it was being installed. </div>

We received 3 notices about &quot;things being dropped on the floors at all times of the day including very early mornings (5:30am)&quot; - It could be my husband opening the bathroom door and closing it to use it since our cat lives in the bathroom during evening and early morning hours. Management knows we have padded carpet since we had to provide insurance letters and have the super available when we installed wall to wall carpeting in the apartment. The super will be requesting someone from management to come in and take pictures of the carpeting. <br /><br />We have discussed this issue with a lawyer when we received a 3rd and final notice of things being dropped during random hours and we may retain him if needed. <br /><br />I wrote lengthy letter to the building manager asking if we can discuss what constitutes as &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;, if they can show us the noise log and what remedies they can suggest to us. </div>

How would he approach it?<br /><br />Btw, what did you say your relationship is with the neighbor below you? Have you approached them either by letter or in person to see if this could be resolved? (Sorry if I missed that.)<br /><br />You mentioned before some work in the building that may have changed the sound proofing, I wonder if you have considered consulting an engineer and having them come in and see if they can evaluate the structural elements. If the engineer can show it&#039;s a building defect...that would be quite valuable. I would definitely explore this and it might be more worth it than paying legal fees.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_85545">^having lived underneath a very heavy walker who paced his apartment at all hours of the night I will say learning to walk without striking first with your heel is a good idea. (We should all know how to do that if we&#039;ve ever walked through grass barefoot) If someone is walking around their apartment walking in shoes (or even if barefoot, walking like they are wearing shoes) it&#039;s super loud.<br /><br />Another option is to wear slippers or some kind of slip on sandals for indoors. I use an old pair of sandal like Crocs, which have a reasonably thick sole and are super comfortable. (When I first started working from home, I was wearing really thin slippers around the house, and developed a painful case of plantar facitis.)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pk9t3BAsic" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pk9t3BAsic</a></div>
