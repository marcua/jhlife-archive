The violation is for &quot;excessive loud noises after-hours (house rules 10:00pm - 9:00am quiet hours), after we have been warned in the past&quot;. We are very confused to these loud noises since we are in bed by 9pm and our cat gets put in the bathroom (we spoke with out neighbors downstairs and agreed to put our cat in the bathroom at night, and in the morning when we&#039;re not home in the bedroom). My husband is up around 530am and gets dressed quietly, my daughter gets up at 7 and are quiet when getting ready. She has to sit (usually watching tv) until it is time to leave for school at 7:45am. <br /><br />Our apartment has thick wall to wall carpeting (we put it down carpet when we received our first notice); the neighbors banged on the ceiling when the company came to take measurements. They banged on our ceiling when the workers just walked across the room to put their equipment down. The neighbor told us he can hear us going to the bathroom at night (we&#039;re a family of 3 with a 5 year old). We are told, one of the complaints is,items are being dropped at all hours.&nbsp; They called the maintenance office one night so they can check on the noise, but my daughter and I were sleeping (8:30pm) and the maintenance guy was very apologetic for waking us. <br /><br />The building is hollow between the floor and ceiling. There is no insulation between the walls and yes we can hear our downstairs neighbor when they talk, watch TV, close doors, listen to music too. We can also hear other neighbors in the hallway, the elevator going up and down, trash being thrown down the compactor chute.but these are what we believe are normal living noise and we hear it because we live in an apartment building. <br /><br />My personal opinion, we are very quiet neighbors. We do not wear shoes in the house, my daughter is not allowed to dance, jump, nor make any noise. We reprimand her when she does. Things get dropped because we&#039;re clumsy humans. We go to bed early (before quiet hours), we do not have any guests over due to the fear of &quot;disturbing&quot; our neighbor and getting more notices from management. I&#039;m at a loss, we purchased this apartment and now we feel we are being harassed by the renters below us. <br /><br />What would you consider to be &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;? Does any one have any opinions on what we can do?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Queensgal I feel your pain.&nbsp; I have been in similar situations where people complained about nothing.&nbsp; Some people&nbsp; expect to hear no noise when they live in the city with community living in buildings.&nbsp; In one building where I purchased a coop the people below me filed one formal complaint after another.&nbsp; The called the police on me several times saying that there were wild parties going on above them and people were dealing drugs from my apartment.&nbsp; One time when the police came another neighbor was in my apartment and he couldn&#039;t believe what I was going through. He later decided he would be my witness about the complaint.&nbsp; Although many coops and condos have bylaws that you can&#039;t sue them -&nbsp; I did and I also sued the people below me for harassment.&nbsp; I was lucky I had a friend who specialized in coop and condo law.&nbsp; The lawsuit forced them to hire some one too.&nbsp; The coop&nbsp; acknowledged that the people below me were&nbsp; complaining for years about everyone above them and they grew weary of the complaints and it was easier to side with them since they were so aggressive.&nbsp; Since we really needed two cars and were thinking of moving&nbsp; we told them we&nbsp; would put our place for sale if they cease and desist.&nbsp; It took about 13&nbsp; months for the sale and the closing and after I was under contract I stomped about in the middle of the night during the last month as a payback. After I sold my place the buyer of my coop called me and told me the people below were complaining and they considered themselves very quiet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had&nbsp; noisy neighbors a bunch of times before and either didn&#039;t complain or&nbsp; made peace with them but this was unbelievable.&nbsp; What really annoyed me was that most of my former neighbors who lived below me told me were we the quietest people who ever lived above them so I know we weren&#039;t making a lot of noise. Even though buying a house&nbsp; wasn&#039;t in my plans I decided to buy one in Bayside.&nbsp; Two parking spots is heaven!&nbsp; I have never been happier and will never live in a coop or condo where someone is above me or below me again!&nbsp; I still visit JH on a regular basis but love my new housing arrangements.

					I&nbsp; already have my answer to that question since i moved to Bayside about five years ago.&nbsp; For me it was a hard decision since I lived in Jackson Heights or the immediate area since the 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; Why did I decide to move?&nbsp; The need for two cars to get to work.&nbsp; Back in the&nbsp; 1980&#039;s neither one of us had a car and we both worked in Manhattan or near JH&nbsp; so it made the decision easy because the area has such great public transportation.&nbsp; We eventually got one car in the 1990&#039;s because we wanted to do day trips on the weekend and going to the beach on public transportation was a long day&nbsp; and a hassle.&nbsp; In 2008 we needed a second car because&nbsp; one of us&nbsp; was working in Eastern Queens and the other in Western&nbsp; Nassau and it was just too hard to get to work with public transportation.&nbsp; After two years of battling the parking we decided to buy a house in Bayside.&nbsp; If we could have rented garages for both cars (even at a high cost) we would have stayed in JH but finding garages close enough to our apartment were elusive.<br /><br />How did things work out?&nbsp; We definitely miss the conveniences of JH and the&nbsp; wide variety of eateries and the ease of getting into the city on weekends and just strolling on 37th avenue.&nbsp; But we found out there were a number of things we didn&#039;t miss at all.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t miss the honking of car horns at all hours, searching for parking, having friends who&nbsp; lived outside the city and needed to visit us by car not come because they couldn&#039;t find parking or not knowing if your new neighbors would be stomping around at all hours of the night or playing loud music.&nbsp; Here are some of the things we love about Bayside.&nbsp; We have a driveway and a garage&nbsp; and aside from not needing to look for parking it is nice when you come home from&nbsp; shopping that&nbsp; you can walk five feet to your door and unload or you can come home late at night and not feel uneasy walking home.&nbsp; We have space for everything since there are only two of us since we don&#039;t have children.&nbsp; We have a backyard where we grow tomatoes, cucumbers and other things and we can BBQ and entertain outside.&nbsp; We are less then 10 minute walks&nbsp; to Little Bay Park and Fort Totten.&nbsp; We are also close to the Bay Terrace Shopping center which has some nice stores and the main drag on Bell Blvd has a number of pubs and places to have&nbsp; drinks and a burger and the stores are getting more diverse each year.&nbsp; The dining is surprisingly good with many Greek, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean eateries.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; Colombian, Peruvian and Mexican restaurant too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong it is not like JH for eating but&nbsp; it has&nbsp; a pretty good selection.<br /><br />What do I do when we miss JH?&nbsp; We take a 20 minute drive and spend a few hours in JH and eat there.&nbsp; I will always love the Heights but&nbsp; I feel living in Bayside and being able to visit JH so easily is the best of both worlds.&nbsp; I would love to hear where others would want to live or if they already left JH where would they go.&nbsp; I am also aware for some people&nbsp; there is no other place they would want to live and plan on staying in JH for a log time.

					A very large one bedroom with a nice layout and from the floorpan it looks like nice closet space.&nbsp; If I was looking to move back to JH I would&nbsp; definitely find out more.&nbsp; Is $2,200&nbsp; the market rate for a one bedroom now I was thinking more around $1850&nbsp; but no fee is a big plus.

					I would prefer not to have TV&#039;s in the restaurant area but would think they are preferable in the bar area if you are looking to draw a bar crowd.&nbsp; There are too many times&nbsp; when there might be a soccer, football or baseball game&nbsp; people might&nbsp; want to watch.<br /><br />In any case sometimes I think this board over estimates how much influence it will have over neighborhood&nbsp; decisions.&nbsp; I like the board to&nbsp; share information but in reality it is a very very small percentage of&nbsp; the people who will visit the neighborhood establishments on which it is commenting. I am guessing there are 25-30 regular posters on this board and how many times a week will these people eat at the Queensboro? The&nbsp; decision on whether to have or not have TV&#039;s&nbsp; will be determined by the customer market.

					I thought it was just a rumor that ICE would be conducting checkpoints on&nbsp; random people outside. Do they actually&nbsp; stop people on the street and ask for their ID and if they can&#039;t produce ID they are detained and deported?&nbsp; What happens if you are on the street and are a legal resident but you can&#039;t produce your ID would they detain you until they can find out if you are legally in the country?

					Thanks for all the responses.&nbsp; The 40X rent rule is interesting, essentially to be able to pay $1,625 per month for a studio you need to make $35.00 an hour, for 35 hours per week,&nbsp; for 52 weeks per year.&nbsp; I doubt most recent college graduates earn that much money so it is up to them to share an apartment.<br /><br />For those who think Astoria is a better area for someone that young I agree.&nbsp; My suggestion&nbsp; to them was to think Astoria first&nbsp; followed by Woodside/Sunnyside&nbsp; and then&nbsp; followed by JH. The neighborhood is not really happening for someone that young.<br /><br />If anyone is interested I will report back when they make their decision.<br />

					My friend&#039;s son is graduating from college this June and they currently live in the Philadelphia suburbs.&nbsp; Their son would like to live in western Queens JH, Astoria Sunnyside etc..&nbsp; He has an offer at a NYC accounting firm at 65K per year but he also has an offer in the Philly area for 58K per year.&nbsp; My friend asked me if you can live on 65K in this area if you want to live on your own and not share an apartment. Since I am well established and no longer live in JH I&#039;m not sure I can offer any solid guidance.&nbsp; Is it possible to rent your own apartment and live on 65K per year in JH or is that a stretch.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.
