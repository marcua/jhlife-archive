			So I took the fur baby for a walk over at Astoria Park today.&nbsp; I see all these dogs in one section so naturally gravitate over.&nbsp; Seems K9 dog trainers have free socializing and training every Sat. from 1pm to 4pm.&nbsp; They have a donation cup on a table.<br /><br />1pm to 2pm is just dogs and owners socializing.<br />2pm to 3pm is walking/heel and stopping/sit commands around the part in an orderly group.&nbsp; There were approx. 30 to 40 dogs of all sizes, ages and temperaments.<br /><br />Then it&#039;s break time.&nbsp; And then more training.&nbsp; If you park in the lot and head over to 19th and 23rd you can&#039;t miss their tent.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Met a lot of nice dogs and people.

			taken with my cell phone but it gives an idea of the group in Astoria Park today. The dogs are lined up smallest to larger so the bigger dogs are farther away and not all in the shot. The photo came out smaller than I thought. oh well.<br /><br />

			I found this dog trainer online and set up a private meeting when I first got Casey and then went to a group class.&nbsp; Really got a lot out of it.&nbsp; Helped me with Casey since he was abused (like most rescues) and very timid.&nbsp; He didn&#039;t know how to play with toys.&nbsp; It was so sad.<br /><br />Anyway, if anyone is ever looking for a Dog Behaviorist:<br /><br />http://www.empireofthedog.com/nyc/index.html<br />
