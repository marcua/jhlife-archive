			I am interested in hearing ANYTHING about this place that existed at 77-11 37th Ave.

			I used to go there OFTEN when I was younger. We are talking well over two decades ago. I remember it was a bit cramped - the prices were always much higher than the Wiz and Coconuts where I usually bought my cassette tapes from. But it was a great play to pick up vinyl and you often had a lot of local aspiring DJ&#039;s coming by there to pick up the latest tunes.

			I used to shop there as a teen, primarily at the smaller store that was located at the corner of 78th Street.&nbsp; Apart from records, they also sold silk screen t-shirts of rock musicians, and posters.

			What were some records or tapes you had purchased there?
