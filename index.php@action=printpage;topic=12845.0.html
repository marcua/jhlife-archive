				Even though I personally miss the convenience of having the Q33 bus go to the LGA terminals, the new Q70 express bus really serves the purpose of connecting the LIRR, 7, E, F, M, and R lines to the airport in an efficient manner. Perhaps the governor could use some of the $450 million that he&#039;s proposing for the AirTran to instead look into ways to improve and expand the Roosevelt Avenue transit hub so that passengers would not have to wait outside on the street for the Q70?

The air train costs much less than taxi (air porter), is much reliable and is not subject to traffic.<br /><br />In terms of saving time for the travellers to LGA. The best way to follow the Q70 bus (it connects the five subway lines at Jackson Heights, including both local and express 7&nbsp; and LIRR at woodside). The next best thing is to connect the Astoria N to LGA. The air train that&nbsp; connects Willet points to LGA&nbsp; will not be utilized much, but better than nothing at all.<br /><br />However, the cost of building air train for the three strategies is the other way around, that is probably why the air train from Willet points to LGA was proposed.

				I don&#039;t see this proposed AirTrain making travel to LGA any more convenient for most people. Any time saved by having a direct rail link to the airport would be negated by the extra time it takes to get to Willets Point, which is farther away, has limited express train service, and extremely limited LIRR service. In addition to not being any quicker, it would triple the price, assuming the fares to LGA are the same as the fares to JFK.<br /><br />I think the existing Q70 service is actually pretty good. There&#039;s no special fare and it connects passengers to five Subway lines—two of which are express most of the day—and a full-time LIRR station. I imagine making improving bus service, with new buses, dedicated bus lanes, etc., would be much less costly than half a billion dollars. <br /><br />But I guess that wouldn&#039;t do anything to improve Joe Biden&#039;s image of LGA.

				Didn&#039;t know Biden was interested!<br /><br />The couple of times I&#039;ve used the Q70 it was very good, but crowded and slow to board. Perhaps a more frequent service (or double buses) and possibly pre-purchase fare? <br /><br />If they go ahead with Willets Point I hope they would install an elevator!<br /><br />

				a rail link has to happen at some point, but the one that cuomo floated was ridiculous for so many reasons (further loading the 7, forcing people past LGA to backtrack to the airport)....and was clearly formulated for the reasons theplanesland suggests.

				This article is from last month (May 2017). I hadn&#039;t realized this proposal was still in the works. A $14 million commitment to develop the proposal makes it sound pretty serious.<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-firm-hired-design-14-6m-airtrain-laguardia-airport-article-1.3148361<br /><br />There were a few discussions about this on JHL but I couldn&#039;t find anything more recent than 2015, so I started this new thread.<br /><br />I thought the Q70 pretty much took care of the lack of public transportation to LGA, and it brings people to a bigger hub than Willets Point. I don&#039;t see the point in spending a massive amount of money to achieve questionable results.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				That 30 minute travel time claim seems pretty absurd. The 7 train alone is a 30 minute ride from Midtown to Willets Point, and that&#039;s without delays (which are common, since it&#039;s already overburdened). Stuffing even MORE people in will only make things worse, and certainly won&#039;t help the &quot;third world country&quot; vibe of LGA as a first impression of NYC. Just a terrible plan all around. LGA needs better transit, but there has to be a better solution.

The route was chosen supposedly because it has absolutely no NIMBY opposition - it goes through mostly uninhabited areas. But I think it was also chosen to funnel people into the shopping mall that Related Companies, a big political donor, was supposed to build on the Willets Point site (which has now been blocked.)<br /><br />The obvious route for a LGA AirTrain would be up the BQE from the 61st/Woodside station, but it didn&#039;t have a shopping mall option.<br /><br />

				What they are building at LGA are the ramps for the cars not the Airtrain. I believe the design does allow space for a train eventually. This would be a waste because few people would take a train that costs $5 when at 74th Street you can take a free bus. The best idea would of been to extend the N train but the MTA has to pay for it.

Cuomo’s office are now working on a new route that would see the planned tracks — which would connect the airport with the No. 7 subway and Long Island Rail Road at Willets Point — placed over the Flushing Bay Promenade, or directly above the water.<br /><br />“That was proposed and it appears the Port Authority and the Governor’s Office are accepting that as a condition to get legislation passed,” Assemblyman Jeff Aubry (D-Corona) told members of Community Board 3 last Thursday.<br /><br />A Cuomo spokesman referred all inquiries to the Port Authority, a spokesman for which said in an emailed statement, “As we continue the planning stage, it’s critical that we do so with full community input. We have conducted several meetings with elected officials and community representatives to gather input regarding the Airtrain’s potential routes in advance of a formal environmental review. Any proposed route cannot be finalized until the environmental review is completed.”<br /><br />Aubry and state Sen. Jose Peralta (D-East Elmhurst) will eventually introduce a bill that will delineate the path of the train.<br /><br />Click link for full article

What a terrible way to ruin the waterfront. The Flushing Promenade is really beautiful (I love running and biking on it), and it could be even more so if anything at all were invested in some improvements and basic maintenance and upkeep. Running the airtrain on top of it is truly the kind of neglect of public spaces that seems to only happen in the outer boroughs.

				Right, the Flushing Bay Promenade is wonderful. I&#039;ve run along it 100s of times. And you&#039;re right, it could use a little more loving. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to suggest that that loving be built around a name change to Beckles Bay. (&quot;Commodore&quot; Pat Beckles was a longtime member of Community Board 3 and chair of its waterfront committee. Pat&#039;s focus turned to the Bay during the Jimmy Carter Administration (maybe it was Richard Nixon) and didn&#039;t end until his demise last year.<br /><br />Such a name change offers several advantages: it differentiates / separates the Promenade from Flushing Bay; its a cause to rally around and organize support for &quot;Beckles Bay;&quot; and it honors an exemplary neighbor. <br /><br />Here&#039;s one voice for Beckles Bay.<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt

				The only connection that really makes sense would be to extend the N line from Ditmars. This area could use a stop along the way. The problem is NIMBY and the Port Authority can’t use money to extend the MTA line. It has to be a separate fare. Now we are going to spend billions to create an eyesore that nobody will use.

				At Ditmars the train would have to travel above ground till it gets to the power plants along the water then it could go underground or stay above ground in a concrete conduit. The new conduit is much more quiet and cheaper to build than a tunnel. You could run it near the water and it wouldn’t disrupt many people. If done underground a TBM would make quick work of the soft clay dirt but because it is so near the water it may be impossible. If you add one or two train stops along the way you could up zone the area to allow bigger buildings. This could even help the whole idea of closing Rikers if the the idea would be to build housing. It is at these times that I wish we had Robert Moses back.

				There is a forum to discuss the Willets Point &gt; LGA AirTrain tonight:<br />Feb. 12 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the New York LaGuardia Airport Marriott<br /><br />&quot;The project, estimated to cost $1.5 billion, aims to reduce traffic congestion and provide travelers with an alternative means of transportation. Currently, 90 percent of LaGuardia flyers travel by car to get to the airport, according to The Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey. The proposed route would run along the Grand Central Parkway and across the edge of the Citi Field Parking lot.&quot;<br /><br />Advocates say taking the 7 to Willets Point from Grand Central will take 15 minutes... which seems impossible. (That is roughly the duration of taking the LIRR to Willets Point is from Penn Station though.)<br /><br />Story with more info here:<br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/community-forum-on-proposed-laguardia-airtrain-to-take-place-tuesday

				Maybe if they call it the Amazon LaGuardia train they could get Amazon to change their minds. This thing is a complete boondoggle. Extending the N train to LGA was the correct way to go. The problem is the PA can’t fund the MTA.
