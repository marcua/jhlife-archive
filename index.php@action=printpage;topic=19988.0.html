				&nbsp;Does anyone know what the plans are for Phase 2 openings for our local restaurants? I heard something about Cafe Eloise in shopping center organizing some restauranteurs there. It would be great to give more business to those on Northern Blvd and 37th Ave. <br />&nbsp;Anything in the works that you know of?

				i&#039;m not on Northern enough to&#039;ve taken a close look, but the sidewalks on 37th are just too narrow to make it work. you need six feet of distancing, and if you try to move six feet from a table, you&#039;re walking in the street -- and the storefronts themselves are quite small. you could only fit one table in front of the Arepa Lady or (if and when it opens), Swim Two Birds.

				This text comes from Business Insider, but I&#039;ve read it elsewhere. <br /><br />&quot;Restaurants in &quot;commercial corridors&quot; will be able to convert parking spaces for dining service. <br /><br />They will need to supply their own barricades and planters to block the area from the road. <br /><br />The city will allow restaurants to register and certify themselves online to expedite the process, but they must comply with guidelines like not blocking bus stops, fire hydrants, and intersections.&quot;

That would allow all the restaurants, bars and cafes along 37th to put tables out on the sidewalks, leaving the middle of the avenue open to pedestrians. (Or conversely, have the street be the seating areas and leave the sidewalks for pedestrians.)

				It seems that some local establishments have decided they can start serving in &quot;outdoor cafes,&quot; despite the fact that the practice is explicitly banned for now. Hope they can afford the fines they&#039;ll incur -- which are not minor, according to the state.

I realize coronavirus and flu are not the same disease, but there&#039;s been so much emphasis on how it&#039;s so hard to transmit the coronavirus outdoors. I guess that was just not true of the Spanish flu? I really hope they are right about outdoor transmission of coronavirus being difficult.<br /><br />This is an excerpt about Spanish flu and the parade: &quot;Within 72 hours of the parade, every bed in Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals was filled. In the week ending October 5, some 2,600 people in Philadelphia had died from the flu or its complications. A week later, that number rose to more than 4,500. With many of the city’s health professionals pressed into military service, Philadelphia was unprepared for this deluge of death.&quot;

				<br />Cuomo amended the executive order:<br /><br /><br />Governor Cuomo amended Executive Order 202.43 (EO) to include updated guidance for food and beverage establishments effective immediately. You can also watch the announcement here.<br />&nbsp;<br />Under this EO, businesses selling or serving alcohol to be consumed at the business or elsewhere must ensure that everyone within 100 feet of their business is: <br /><br />In compliance with open-container, social-distancing, and face-covering rules; and <br />Following all existing rules, regulations, and laws. <br /><br />Businesses that cannot follow these guidelines must stop selling alcohol until they can. <br />&nbsp;<br />Violations could result in having a license suspended or revoked, with fines up to $10,000 per violation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Patrons can also be fined for breaking open container or social distancing rules. <br /><br /><br /><br />———<br /><br />I wonder if the bars on Northern will abide... seems like a stiff penalty <br /><br />

				We had lunch at Laly’s today and it was really nice (albeit with the train rumbling overhead every few minutes). It was nice to eat outside and very weird to be eating at a restaurant. Not sure if I’ll do it too often but it was a nice change of pace. <br /><br />Lots of places in the neighborhood are opening up outdoor spaces, Romeo’s has added plants and barriers to make a nice dining area.

				<strong>Reopening NYC: Queens Restaurants + Street Vendors Weigh In<br /></strong><br />The Eat Your World Blog (https://eatyourworld.com/blog/reopening-nyc-queens-restaurants-street-vendors-weigh-in/)<br /><em><br />We’ve all heard about the struggles of restaurants, in New York City and elsewhere, but what about the ones we know and love in our own neighborhoods? It’s a question that’s weighed on me, as the few I’ve been in touch with personally in Jackson Heights have expressed many struggles over the course of the pandemic. A lot of the businesses here in our part of Queens are small and immigrant-owned, compounding the difficulty of obtaining financial aid. So in recent weeks I’ve spoken or emailed with a few restaurant and street cart owners in Queens to ask: How has it been for you these past few months, and what does “reopening” look like to you?</em><br /><br /><strong>[Click on above link for complete blog entry.]<br /><br /></strong>
