				Someone in one of the other threads wanted some more details on the income trends which lead upscale retail to not consider Jackson Heights, and pointed out that perhaps the historic district has different income trends than 11372 as a whole.<br /><br />There is a GREAT mapping tool on the Census Web site with 2012 community survey data (http://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html) Choose &quot;median household income&quot; and &quot;census tract,&quot; and then zoom in on Jackson Heights, and you can get the area really tightly segmented.<br /><br />What you find is that there is one tiny little census tract, from 78th-81st Streets between 37th Avenue and Northern Boulevard, with a much higher median income than the rest of the surrounding tracts. And much of the surrounding area is actually the lightest, low-income color. We appear to have a *lower* median income than Woodside or Sunnyside or other surrounding areas. You can go tract by tract and compare it to, say, Astoria, Long Island City and Forest Hills - well, especially Forest Hills, where wow.<br /><br />I know in my historic building, a lot of the people living here are older and living on Social Security or pensions. I remember a few years ago when I tried to do something as simple as get better Internet access into the building - very few people were actually interested.<br /><br />I know I keep harping on this. And I would love to be contradicted. But the people around here who claim JH is able to support magically far more upscale retail than it has supported for the past 10 years should pony up and show some statistics rather than anecdata. I haven&#039;t seen any actual hard data beyond &quot;oooh, well, me and my six friends would totally shop here.&quot;<br />

				Finally someone is talking realistically.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hoorray!<br /><br />I love JH.&nbsp; But open your eyes when you walk around.&nbsp; We&#039;re mostly a new immigrant &#039;hood.<br /><br />That&#039;s just the facts.&nbsp; The 10,000 max in the historic district are less than 10% of the at least 110,000 population of Jax Hts.<br /><br />So the figures who might sustain fancy retail...are maybe 10,000.&nbsp; While the truth is 100,000 are perfectly happy with non fancy stores...maybe even all American (singing: I wanna be in America!) chain store...options...<br /><br />Reality check time.<br /><br />My two bits.<br /><br /><br />

				I agree that a median income level around $50k is probably not enough to support a major high-end shopping district, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what most people are saying they want. It seems like most people are saying they want a nice bistro or gastro-pub to get a burger and a cocktail, or brunch once in a while. And $50k a year is definitely high enough to support that level of luxury. Our median income is actually higher than bed-stuy, which, as mentioned, has several of such places.<br /><br />Back when I worked in restaurants, which was a long time ago, I&#039;ll admit, I heard a statistic that was something like around 10,000 people who made over $30k had to live within a couple miles for a mid-range restaurant to have a chance of making it. I think, looking at the census map, a good American style restaurant would have an excellent shot of succeeding.

				As a whole, JH is certainly not a wealthy neighborhood. But these census results are somewhat misleading. It lists the medium income for people on Central Park West at around $100k-130k. For the West Village, about $110k. And for the East Village, about $65k. But we know that some of these areas are full of multimillionaires (as well as rent-controlled tenants).

The way I look at it is not to look at the specific number, but to *compare* our neighborhood to others. Are we higher or lower than other neighborhoods with the kinds of places we want? Lower, it looks like.<br /><br />More than that, though, I&#039;d love to inject some more actual numbers into this conversation - to ground it in impartial stats rather than anecdotes. And to look at this the way retailers might be looking at it.

				Add a bareburger type place, and a hip bar to 37th ave, add some press, and I guarantee the demographics would shift in the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />Best location for a pub/restaurant.<br /><br />Primadonna is finally closing its location on 37th and 81st.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Best location for a hip bar (maybe like kickhaw or dominies) would be 83rd off of 37th ave.<br /><br />Ive been thinking about looking for backers, but I&#039;d want in.&nbsp; But besides desire and passion and some restaurant experience I have no money to back.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br /><br />:o(

				No one is looking to turn 37th Avenue into Fifth Avenue, or 7th Avenue in Park Slope, etc.&nbsp; A few more varied and comfortable establishments would work here.&nbsp; People questioned Starbucks and that is always packed.&nbsp; Arunee did a nice job remodeling and that is always packed.&nbsp; &nbsp;As for the immigrant restaurants, some of those that are packed such as Chivito D&#039;Oro and Las Margaritas are actually quite pricey.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I go to the NYSC gym in Sunnyside it is packed with immigrants.&nbsp; So the businesses begin suggested for JH would likely appeal to MANY in the neighborhood.

				Pipman-- I just made a similar comment on the &quot;Why do you leave the neighborhood&quot; thread here. Yes, there are lots of folks spending very good money at the restaurants you just mentioned. And those same people would likely patronize one of the better chains like Bareburger or Five Napkins or whatever.&nbsp; And they would join a bigger, nicer gym. The group that is trying to influence better retail to go into the Bruson Building uncovered the sales materials the real estate agents are using to lure possible tenants. It lists population and median income figures for JH, and has a map showing that we have Duane Reade, RiteAid, Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, Burger King, McDonalds...if I am remembering correctly, that&#039;s what the map shows, I guess because that&#039;s what the realtors are trying to attract. I did not notice Arunee or E77 or Cafe 79 or any of the other nicer restaurants on that map.

				The things frequently asked for, brunch spots, hip bars, trendy burger joints et cetera, are distinctly American in culture, with the preponderance (not all of course!) of their patrons being younger, native born and wealthier (and I&#039;d venture zero dependents, but that can be folded into disposable wealth).&nbsp; We have a large percentage of folks over 65 here, as well as a % of foreign born which is towering even by NYC standards and many families with many kids.&nbsp; Frankly, I think they have more to do with it than income levels.<br /><br />JH is a very densely populated hood, and by absolute numbers, there is a kernel of folks who could support such establishments.&nbsp; Problem is the nose of the investment dollar, in particularly with risky businesses like eateries.&nbsp; Quit the day job, pull in the life savings, put it all on the line for the 10% willing to pay $12 for an eggs benedict or the 50% willing to pay $24 for a good parilla? People keep pointing to Starbucks, but Starbucks is a chain and chains can better weather risk.&nbsp; And if you make that great waffles and chicken, why come to JH?&nbsp; The only reason why you&#039;d do it is because no one else is doing it, rather than setting up shop where rum soaked jalapeno goat cheese poppers are not so niche.&nbsp; No one is saying it can&#039;t be done, its just awfully hard and money is like water, it generally follows the easiest path.&nbsp; For individual shops with individual character, it takes a person with some balls.<br /><br />And its not just your balls, but also the landlord&#039;s balls.&nbsp; When Peter Moceo wanted to open Rice to Riches, finding a space was difficult because no landlord thought that a place which only sold rice pudding could make their rent.&nbsp; Landlords want a steady, stable tenant.&nbsp; Hats off that he defied the odds and made a go of it, but he is the exception.&nbsp; In Jackson Heights 2015, the odds are on a Seba Seba rather than a Hope &amp; Anchor.&nbsp; When the demographics change, so do the odds (Moceo was arrested and may have used his shop to launder money, so maybe we can get a li&#039;l coke and cupcakes thing working).

				All very good points, Palermo, but I want to note that people over 65 are not necessarily eating beans at home every night. They may be receiving Social Security and small pensions, and thus be on a &quot;fixed income,&quot; but that does not mean they don&#039;t have substantial assets as well.&nbsp; They do go out to eat, they do travel, etc. From what I&#039;ve observed, many older people who may have had modest jobs/salaries their whole lives have saved and are very comfortable financially, having benefited from the post-WW II boom times. They may have more generous pension benefits, including healthcare benefits, than younger people will ever get, they may have accumulated wealth from the big run up in real estate and stock prices. I know retired people who worked in public education their whole lives who own city apartments they bought for peanuts that are now worth millions, as well as summer homes they bought at the right time, etc. <br /><br />And I think the effort is to attract better chains, in fact, not necessarily the lone entrepreneur. The latter would be great but not as realistic. I don&#039;t see why the better chains wouldn&#039;t want to come in here, as some have to surrounding Queens neighborhoods.

				Redge: this is GREAT news! I am also one of your first customers. We have been organizing a group to see what we can do to attract some more varied dining options to JH, which many of us believe definitely can support more restaurants that are not the ubiquitous formica tables, plastic trays, fluorescent lighting, Coke machine and wall-mounted TV places. Those are great to have, too, but there are lots of people in JH who would love to have a nice place for drinks, more sit-down dining options including American/European/Italian, a nice bistro, even a good burger place or pub that was not a sports bar. I and others have pointed out that some of the South American restaurants already here seem to be always packed and are NOT cheap at all. Why wouldn&#039;t some of those customers also support other options?&nbsp; There is stereotype that this is a neighborhood for poor immigrants and yes, maybe there are a few more affluent people here, but basically this is a cheap food only neighborhood because that&#039;s all the neighborhood can support. I disagree. I think (as many have also pointed out) that the main issue preventing JH from having more/better retail and dining options is very high commercial rents, higher than in Bed-Stuy or wherever. Not sure why that is the case. The people who seem to want the neighborhood to remain frozen in time and think everyone should shut up and just leave the neighborhood if they want a good gym or a bistro meal--well, I just totally disagree with that notion.

				Lalochezia (did I spell it right?)--that&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about! Thank you. Okay so the Spotted Pig prices are a tad higher, still we do have many places that are pretty darn pricey and seem to attract a lot of business. People act as if JH only has places that are cheap, cheap, cheap and that&#039;s all it can support. Not true. I do love the fact that my husband and I can have a really great Thai meal at Cafe 79 at an amazingly thrifty price, at Thakali Kitchen as well—2 of our faves—but one can also spend a LOT more money on dinner right here on 37th Avenue. At places that are doing great business.

				I would patronize a gastropub or higher quality American restaurant in the neighborhood so often - for date night, for 5 PM family dinner, for brunch, as part of the tour with which I hope to lure friends here (which also includes lots of older neighborhood spots that I love and will continue to visit frequently).&nbsp; It is true that we are not a wealthy neighborhood, but this can happen.

				I think this neighborhood could easily support a modern American restaurant.&nbsp; The median income (according to the last census) was $55k; that was in 2014. (I originally thought it was 2010.) There are a lot of people who are price sensitive in the neighborhood, but trust me, there are others who are not (and must leave the &#039;hood when we want modern American or bistro food).

				An American bistro do great here. It would also work as an anchor for the Bruson as well. I think this neighborhood could definitely support it. I see plenty of wholefoods and Bloomingdales shopping bags getting off the subway and walking down 37th avenue. Wouldn&#039;t it be great to have a fun place to stop off before going home for dinner or a drink.

				I also agree that something like that would do well here. It&#039;s a dated and totally un-hip reference but I was idly thinking something along the lines of a toned-down version of Coffee Shop on Union Square would absolutely have broad enough appeal to be successful here. Armando&#039;s and La Portena were both relatively pricey and busy. And not incidentally, they were both located in the Bruson Building!

				I guess Redge the term &#039;gastropub&#039; comes up a lot because what a lot of people are looking for is a comfortable neighborhood bar/restaurant that offers something exciting and fresh to this neighborhood, but is also approachable and doesnt rewrite the book.<br /><br />What you are talking about sounds more akin to Salt and Fat (how are they doing, by the way?) in Sunnyside.<br /><br />Our closest comparison here would be alchemy BBq, which failed for many reasons.&nbsp; Two of the largest being that Josh, the owner, was operating as a rented space in the back of a bar, with no access to the alcohol sales.&nbsp; Also, the location for experimental bbq was wrong, off the beaten path and in the back of a bar that isn&#039;t exactly attracting a hip clientelle.&nbsp; <br /><br />The description of what you would like to present the neighborhood is a bit cryptic, which im sure is purposefully done.&nbsp; If maybe you could tell us a bit more, than maybe you will get the feedback you want as to whether the place you are looking to create would be feasable.<br />

				The comments both here and in private messages are much appreciated.<br /><br />We&#039;re going ahead with a restaurant. The question is whether we&#039;ll open in Manhattan or Jackson Heights. This neighborhood is well served by South American, East Indian and Asian restaurants offering casual dining. The question is whether the area will support a modern American restaurant that offers more refined service (when it comes to service, we think that Danny Meyer has it right in his book on hospitality, Setting the Table). There is no clear answer to the question because, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has tried to do it. It&#039;s a risk, but also an opportunity.<br /><br />The chef/owner trained principally in France, specifically in Paris and the Rhône-Alpes. This means that French technique will be at the core of the menu. Beyond saying that, it is difficult at this early stage to define &quot;modern American&quot; because the menu has to be responsive to the neighborhood. In the case of Jackson Heights, this means a menu that is of interest to people of a number of ethnic backgrounds. Over the last few years, there have been interesting developments in Latin cuisine, and these developments may be reflected in parts of the menu. Similarly, traditional Italian influences are evident in both American cuisine and some South American cuisine, which suggests that modern Italian influences may have broad appeal in this community.<br /><br />We don&#039;t plan to compete with existing Jackson Heights restaurants. The community is at a saturation point for places that are based on minimal decor, casual service, high turnover of tables, and menus involving very inexpensive ingredients. It is possible to buy a steak for less than what one costs at a good butcher. There is no point in opening a restaurant that offers more of the same.<br /><br />All of that said, the message about burgers comes through loud and clear. There will be one.<br />

				Definitely sounds interesting Redge.&nbsp; I mean, if someone approached me with the idea of opening a traditional French Pastry shop like Canelle in a strip mall way deep in East Elmhurst, I would have guessed it wouldn&#039;t succeed. I think there are a lot of lessons to be taken for why they are successful.&nbsp; <br /><br />I get the feeling you know all this so I don&#039;t want my reiteration to sound patronizing but I feel the need to mention it because so many places in our neighborhood get this wrong.<br /><br />Cannele is successful because of their consistency, freshness and high-quality. They offer things that cannot be found in our neighborhood, and are not readily available in the city in general. That&#039;s why there&#039;s always lines out the door even though it&#039;s not easy to get to.<br /><br />Oh, and let&#039;s not forget the fact they are so reasonable in price.<br /><br />Considering their French theme and success, I would guess that your restaurant could be successful in this neighborhood.<br /><br />For me personally, it would probably be a place I&#039;d be glad to have around and can tout, but not one I would frequent regularly. That&#039;s because I have two young girls and regarding going out we look for restaurants that are family friendly.&nbsp; Unless its date night.&nbsp; I guess it depends on the price point as well. I just tend to be interested in the casual rather than the upscale.&nbsp; Again, that&#039;s just me. I welcome any sort of diversity to this neighborhood And would be happy to help spread the word.<br /><br />I could also start brushing up on my django if you&#039;re interested in having live music.

				I guess what confuses me is why people who think that the neighborhood can&#039;t sustain a somewhat more upscale and/or &quot;American syle&quot; restaurant are so incredibly negative about it.&nbsp; Of course anyone who opens a new restaurant business in this neighborhood should do their research and make sure there&#039;s clientele for it.&nbsp; But what do any of us have to gain by opening up more of the same?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want this neighborhood to turn into Brownstone Brooklyn, but there are tons of empty storefronts right now and I, for one, would love to see some more variety in our restaurants in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I love and patronize what we have, but I&#039;d also be very happy to see more.

				ptbass75,<br /><br />Note that I said French technique, not French cuisine. Many of the New York&#039;s best restaurants are based on French technique, but are very much American when it comes to their food.<br /><br />We believe that children should be welcome in any restaurant provided that they are old enough to understand that a restaurant is not a race track or young enough that they are incapable of racing :) Lots of young kids are entirely capable of rising to the occasion, and we may very well have a children&#039;s menu, certainly for weekend brunch.<br /><br />I love Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli (I had the privilege of seeing Grappelli perform with Julian Lloyd Webber), but I&#039;m not sure how well their music would go over in a New York restaurant in 2015.

				I just noticed the thread that cult artist has started entitled &quot;BAR&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have mentioned it, but our restaurant, regardless of where we open it, will have a bar where food can be ordered or not as the customer prefers. I can assure you that both women and men will find the experience civilized. There is a question about whether the license will include spirits as well as wine and beer, an issue that depends among other things on location. We will certainly be putting a good deal of emphasis on offering interesting wines by the bottle and glass, including fortified wines such as port and sherry, and a strong selection of beer styles.

				A couple of things to note. The census measures median *household* income. The median figure is where half of what&#039;s being being measured falls below the median, and the other 50 percent follows above. So, this doesn&#039;t mean that the average income in Jackson Heights is $50K, it means that 50% of all households - which includes single people, couples, and couples with kids - makes more than 50K and 50% makes less.<br /><br />A two income household making $75K a year isn&#039;t rich. Add a couple of kids, and they&#039;re even less rich.

				I haven&#039;t been following this thread or been on the site for awhile so I apologize in advance of my comment if it has already been made or is off topic.<br /><br />There is more income in this neighborhood than the census reveals. People of lesser means have ways of not reporting income, like renting out a room in the house for instance, working off the books, not reporting tips, not revealing full household membership, etc.<br /><br />That&#039;s not to suggest that people of means don&#039;t do the same, they just have legal channels for it. We all do it and it is sanctioned, i.e. having a job &quot;benefit&quot; like transportation voucher before taxes. Business/investor loss is another, &quot;Swiss&quot; bank accounts, etcetera. <br /><br />The places that are well received (Las Margaritas, Cannelle, Pollo you-name-it) are packed with what the census track is showing as poor. This neighborhood can support anything. Some of the chains are just concerned with the image of who their customers are. Go to Great Neck and you&#039;ll see empty store after empty store.

Some, but by no means all, landlords in parts of this area are looking for renewals or new leases at rents that are difficult to fathom if the tenant expects his or her business to generate a livelihood. Indeed, there are some existing leases at rents that strike me as inconsistent with the tenant&#039;s business being profitable.<br /><br />

				I hope you do it here and not in Manhattan! It think it really IS an opportunity, since we have nothing like this right now. A personal plea: try not to make it too &quot;haute cuisine&quot; because I&#039;m not sure how that would work. I&#039;m thinking of a place that opened a few years ago in my old neighborhood, Washington Heights, that tried so hard to be innovative. I would have tried it, but every dish on the menu was so unusual and, to me, weird-sounding, with unlikely pairings of ingredients, that I didn&#039;t see anything that appealed to me and just never felt like going there. I like simple, classic food with fresh ingredients, cooked beautifully. Really good vegetables, really good bread. I&#039;m fairly illiterate in the language of foodies, but it&#039;s probably &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; that I am not so fond of.&nbsp; Yes? The kind of thing where the menu mentions, say, string beans, but when the dish arrives you can&#039;t even find them since they are artfully minced or pureed and hidden under the tower of mashed potatoes with the sprig of rosemary or whatever. Just my personal preference, but I think simpler is better and appeals to a wider range of customers. So that &#039;s what I would hope for, but I would definitely patronize what you are describing.

				I think income can be deceptive.&nbsp; For years we didn&#039;t have a Starbucks because we didn&#039;t meet the demographic - now our Starbucks is probably one of the busier ones in the chain.&nbsp; My income is in a higher range yet I probably spend less on clothing than someone with a lower income.&nbsp; While a teenager with a parti time job may spend a few thousand on jeans, coffee, and makeup.&nbsp;

				That seems about right. The Land Mark district proper, and not simply the historic district, is tenanted with a higher tax bracket of people, the Towers being probably the highest. <br /><br />

				Good work kcummings <br /><br />With the new construction there and the vast number of condos built in the last 5 years, the LIC numbers are out of date. Virtually ALL new construction is aimed at households with &gt;$100k annual income. (Rents start at 2.2k for a studio, and 1BRs are 2.7k and up for example, to buy studios are $450k+, 1brs are $600k+; it&#039;s more expensive than most of the UES now!). <br /><br />&nbsp;But it&#039;s true: JH having SEVEN THOUSAND* households with &gt;$75k income (and again, this is <strong>rising</strong>, I would not be surprised if this number was 20-30% higher than measured in the survey), there is easily the demographic to support small numbers of the things we have been talking about. <br /><br />

				Speaking of commercial properties, this piece in the Sunday Times is about a co-op paying about $20/month in maintenance in the West Village (yup, twenty). It&#039;s interesting how they went about looking for businesses to rent out their storefronts; it seems they had similar concerns to what our residents seem to have, about certain types of franchises coming in, etc. (Other than that though, I don&#039;t think many of JH&#039;s co-ops have access to commercial sections like this; seems like the stores are usually in the rental buildings, but still, the story is fascinating and somewhat inspiring...)<br /><br />http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/realestate/co-op-maintenance-reduced-to-almost-nothing.html

				Does this survey include the people who are renting rooms from the renters?&nbsp; Some of these apartments are renting every viable space there is, including hallways in the apartments.&nbsp; Which is why we see the overload of garbage on the corners.&nbsp; Both cops and landlords turn a blind eye to this.<br />When my parents moved here back in the 50&#039;s JH&nbsp; rivaled 5th Avenue.&nbsp;

				i doubt that those people are included. they&#039;re invisible and both they and the people illegally renting to them pretend they&#039;re not even there. if they were included, the income levels would drop a LOT. after all, not many of the people surreptitiously renting a piece of a basement are making over 75K a year.

				What we do not need here are more apartments.&nbsp; We are over-developed as it is.&nbsp; Our streets are crowded.&nbsp; Our schools are over-crowded to handle the student population.&nbsp; Our services are strained.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for development but developing the spaces we already have not creating more spaces to be occupied.&nbsp; We really need more open space.&nbsp; Lower buildings (more light &amp; air) and more green space.&nbsp; My two cents.

				The issue is not the census not trying to count people or people pretending that uncounted people are not there, it&#039;s people not wanting to be counted, which then shortchanges a neighborhood, including services relied upon by immigrants. as I remember it, the Census Bureau had an unsuccessful outreach effort to assure illegal immigrants that responding to the census would not compromise their status.&nbsp; <br /><br />NYT<br /><br />Invoking the Census Bureau’s own data and other evidence, New York City officials argued on Wednesday that the 2010 count had overlooked at least 50,000 residents of Brooklyn and Queens living in homes and apartments that the bureau incorrectly concluded were vacant.<br /><br />If they had been counted, they would have pushed the city’s official population to more than 8.2 million, the Bloomberg administration said in submitting its formal challenge to the Census Bureau.<br /><br />Though the city maintains that the bureau committed counting errors across the city, its challenge focuses on four neighborhoods, Astoria and Jackson Heights in Queens and Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, which the Bloomberg administration described as among New York’s most vibrant and where it said the undercount was the greatest.<br /><br />The population count released by the Census Bureau in March said that the city had grown by 166,855 people, to 8,175,133, since 2000 — a rate of 2.1 percent, compared with 9.4 percent during the 1990s. City demographers maintain that while the recession and the aftermath of 9/11 slowed growth in the last decade, New York is now home to at least 8.3 million people.<br /><br />While any adjustment would come too late to affect the reapportionment of Congressional districts based on the official census count, more than bragging rights are at stake. A higher count could mean more federal aid in categories apportioned by population and a bigger base from which subsequent annual population estimates issued by the Census Bureau are computed until the next census in 2020.<br /><br />“I recognize that enumerating the population of New York City is a Herculean and unenviable challenge, given the city’s large, diverse and dense population, which lives primarily in difficult to count housing arrangements,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a letter to Robert M. Groves, the director of the Census Bureau.<br /><br />But armed with detailed evidence from demographers in the city’s Planning Department, the mayor insisted that local census workers responsible for Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Astoria and Jackson Heights had “erroneously classified large numbers of housing units as vacant.”<br /><br />“Numerous data sources cited in our submission refute the prevalence of widespread vacant housing units in those areas, which are and continue to be among our most stable, growing and vibrant neighborhoods,” Mr. Bloomberg wrote. “This disproportionate concentration of vacancy suggests that some aspect of the census enumeration went awry in these two offices, with likely processing errors that may have hindered the proper reporting, compilation, and tabulation of census results.”<br /><br />The city unsuccessfully filed a formal challenge to the census count in 1990. Five years ago, city demographers persuaded the Census Bureau to raise its July 1, 2005, estimate by 160,000 — including 64,000 found by the Planning Department — to 8.2 million. The 2009 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau placed the population estimate at 8,391,881.<br /><br />The census’s official 2010 count also seemed curious because while it found 166,000 more New Yorkers than in 2000, the number of homes and apartments in the city had increased since then by 170,000.<br /><br />“Immediately, you’re suspicious,” said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the population division at the Planning Department.<br /><br />By the official count, the population of Queens rose by only 1,343, or 0.1 percent, from 2000 to 2010; Brooklyn’s rose by 39,374, or 1.6 percent. Vacancies soared by 214 percent in southern Brooklyn and by 174 percent in northwestern Queens, well above the citywide average. City officials concluded that neither the bureau’s earlier American Community Survey nor its separate Housing and Vacancy Survey supported the 2010 count. Nor did the pace of new construction and foreclosures, and nor did average rents, which should have declined if more apartments were vacant.<br />The city’s claim of an undercount will be examined at the Census Bureau headquarters and could take months to resolve. If the claim is rejected, said Marc LaVorgna, a mayoral spokesman, all options, including legal action, “remain on the table.”<br /><br />Since June, 48 localities have filed challenges under the bureau’s Count Question Resolution Program, which considers questions of misplaced boundaries and, in the case of New York City’s complaint, of coverage where housing units were excluded because of processing errors. Only one count has been adjusted so far, in Maharishi Vedic City, a community in southeastern Iowa founded by followers of the Transcendental Meditation movement, where the count was increased from 259 people to 1,294 to reflect misplaced housing<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />
