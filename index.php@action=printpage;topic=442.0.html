				I decided today, because it wasn&#039;t too cold, to take my 2yo for a walk all the way to Austin St. in Forest Hills. It was a bit more exhausting than I had anticipated, but, it sure felt like I was headed towards Oz when I realized I was headed straight for Loehmann&#039;s. I had no idea there was one out that way!&nbsp; I suppose that is a good thing. I&#039;ve actually hoofed out to Chelsea to go there. No more!&nbsp; A Loehmann&#039;s that is *almost* walkable!&nbsp; Woot!

				That&#039;s what&#039;s great about Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Although we don&#039;t have any of these large department stores in our neighborhood, they&#039;re actually not too far off if you enjoy a good walk.&nbsp; I&#039;ve walked plenty of time to the Queens Center Mall and to the Rego Park Mall.&nbsp; I heard that soon there will also be a Century 21 in Rego Park, so that gives me another excuse for a long walk!&nbsp; Only I may be too tired to shop, so I&#039;ll probably be better off taking the subway on my first visit. ;)

				You might be interested in the Google map Pedometer, which lets you draw a route and it will caculate the walking distance.&nbsp; You could draw a route in advance, or do it after you come home to find out how far you really walked.<br />The strange thing about this system is that apparently doesn&#039;t let you input an address - you just have to keeping zooming in on the map until you find your starting point.&nbsp; But it still works and it&#039;s pretty easy.<br />http://www.webwalking.com/googlemap.htm<br /><br />I was over in Rego Park today and had printed out a map to walk back along the shortest route, but I found the subway beckoning to me after only a few blocks on Queens Blvd.<br />
