				A new fried chicken (and everything else) place has opened on 37th Ave...in a prime location...near the 76th street corner. <br /><br />Rarely have I seen more clashing colors... and an aesthetically discordant decor. Mirror tiles, loud shades of red and a multitude of signs screaming...<br /><br />It hurts a person&#039;s eyes going into that joint...<br /><br />No idea what the food is like.&nbsp; Won&#039;t be able to enter again until I wear my dark sunglasses...<br /><br />

				I stopped in last night around 7:30.&nbsp; Lots of employees but no customers.&nbsp; They had a lot of fried chicken prepared.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat fried foods so this place is not for me.&nbsp; Only time will tell if this place will succeed.&nbsp;

				went there to get the 15 piece thigh and legs fried chicken and the lady pretty much gave me all breast meat.&nbsp; I asked for thighs and legs and she kept saying the breast pieces were thighs and legs and looked at me all funny like I didn&#039;t know what pieces she was giving me.&nbsp; so i tried again with the guy working there and he said &quot;it&#039;s all chicken&quot; so i politely said no thank you and walked out.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will stick with Popeyes on 82nd st.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve become a regular at Al Araf Halal for the past year and take out food at least once a week.&nbsp; I enjoy the vegetarian although I occasionally have the non vegetarian.&nbsp; Great food at great prices.&nbsp; For the past 3 - 4 days its been closed for maintenance.&nbsp; They have posted in the window a Health Department Inspection Certificate that is an &quot;A&quot;, but that could be a previous inspection.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that they haven&#039;t failed a more recent inspection but then wouldn&#039;t there be a notice posted on the window by the Health Department.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping they reopen soon.&nbsp; The food is similar to Al Naimat but I prefer Al Araf.&nbsp;

				i really like this place as well. their haleem is very good. but the lease was for sale on loop.net some time last year, and i wonder if they managed to sell. they did a far better job of fast-steam table food than paradise biriyani pointe, which was in the space before.

				A second sign was posted in the window about a week ago, &quot;under construction&quot;.&nbsp; I walk by every day and the lights are out and there&#039;s no construction.&nbsp; I miss the place but hopefully it will reopen.&nbsp; In the meantime, I&#039;m back to Al Naimat.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m also looking forward to the reopening of the City Coffee with a new owner and the opening of Romeo&#039;s Italian Restaurant.&nbsp;

				i saw some activity in Al-Araf a couple of days ago, and it doesn&#039;t look dismantled, so there&#039;s some hope. and definitely looking forward to the Arepa Lady opening in the old City Coffee space.

				They seem to be closed yet again, more permanently. I heard that they may have indeed sold to someone else. Hopefully it remains somewhat similar.

				Well, no, word is it will not be similar (thankfully, from my point of view). It is supposed to be a new Indonesian restaurant. I saw the inside one day when the door was open, and it looked like a nice, attractive interior--as opposed to the garish look of the previous tenant--IMHO.
