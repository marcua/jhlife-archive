Crazy college student, who has not been committed to an asylum or jail yet, does something else stupid.<br /><br />https://loomered.com/2019/12/03/exclusive-jewish-student-arrested-during-shabbat-services-after-protesting-anti-semitism-at-amherst/<br />&nbsp;(https://loomered.com/2019/12/03/exclusive-jewish-student-arrested-during-shabbat-services-after-protesting-anti-semitism-at-amherst/)<br /><br />a fake bomb, a husky, a tesla... all that is missing is a kindle of kittens. (I had to look that up.)<br /><br />It was thoughtful of him to put the fake bomb on the outside of the stolen car. <br /><br />The article did not say how close this was to the Apple store. We need the pertinent facts.<br /><br />Also, the article did not mention if he got a covid small business loan. <br /><br />Where was the tesla stolen? Is someone in Amherst walking to campus because he/she/them is/are Tesla-less?<br /><br />(I apologize for using the word &#039;Huskie&quot; which according to wikipedia has racist origins. <em>&quot;The word husky originated from the word referring to aboriginal Arctic people, in general, Eskimo, &quot;...known as &#039;huskies&#039;, a contraction of &#039;Huskimos&#039;, the pronunciation given to the word &#039;Eskimos&#039; by the English sailors of trading vessels.&quot; &quot;</em>)<br /><br />(This post was not meant to be insulting to any persons or animals. No huskies or kittens were injured in the production of this post.)

Even when they didn&#039;t know who did it or the motive? My theory on that was that they knew it was most likely a white guy from the way things went down, so they called it &quot;an intentional act&quot; from Day 1, Hour 1, as opposed to a terrorist act. I kept looking for the word terrorist and never saw it... but who knows, I didn&#039;t read every article.<br /><br />Is the Queens mall fake bomb really being called attempted terrorism? If so, I can&#039;t see how comparing the two events makes sense. The Nashville bomb WAS terrorism and wasn&#039;t referred to as such. The Queens fake bomb was...well, who knows, not much of anything compared to the devastation inflicted on Nashville.

				the Nashville bomber was never called a terrorist because of his ethnicity. this fellow won&#039;t be decried because his mindset is in line with the right wing. just the way a conservative country operates.<br /><br />and attempted acts of terror are still acts of terror. Shoe bomber Richard Reid went to jail for decades even though all he did was give himself a minor burn on his thumb.

Both Nashville and Queens were acts of terror, despite how they might be referred to by the FBI and the press.
