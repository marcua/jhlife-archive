					Some of the lots were still in existence in 1956 when my mother would walk me to kindergarten at P.S. 149. We lived directly across 34th Avenue from the prewar building with the &#039;dunce-caps.&#039;&nbsp; Our building, 86-11, was called The Bristol, and was part of a five building group called Saxony Apartments.&nbsp; The other buildings were The Cumberland (had a playground attached on the 88th Street side), The Dorset, The Chatham, and The Sheffield.&nbsp; The developer was obviously an Anglophile.

					That&#039;s a great small world story about the NJ State Trooper. Speaking of change, I mentioned that my parents moved to 33-27 91st Street, part of a coop development called Southridge, in 1965.&nbsp; At the time you moved out of 89-14 in 1954, Southridge didn&#039;t even exist.

					Definitely.&nbsp; While it may not have been there in 1950, it was certainly there by the middle of the decade.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my follow up post I found the name,&nbsp; Feldman&#039;s Deli, in a 1950&#039;s phone book in the New York Public Library.&nbsp; Did you live in that area?&nbsp; If so, on what street and during what years?

					On yesterday&#039;s episode of <em><strong>The Good Wife</strong></em>, the Julianna Margulies drama that airs on CBS, Jackson Heights had a cameo role. &nbsp;Specifically, two scenes having to do with an Indian travel agency and sari shop were filmed on a stretch of 37th Avenue from about 80th Street up to 84th Street. &nbsp;Although the show is supposed to take place in Chicago, sharp-eyed New Yorkers who watch the series can often identify exteriors shot in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.

					I&#039;m going to answer my own question.&nbsp; I recently visited Room 100 at the 42nd Street Library and was able to view on microfilm, a Queens telephone directory from the 1950&#039;s. The place I was trying to think of was Feldman&#039;s Kosher Delicatessen &amp; Restaurant at 89-16 Northern Boulevard.

					(This is a continuation of an earlier post) There were four bowling alleys: &nbsp;34th Lanes on 34th Avenue between 69th and 70th Streets (technically Woodside), Northern Lanes between Northern Boulevard and 32nd Avenue in the 70â€™s, Montclair Lanes below street level on 37th Avenue and about 75th Street, and another below street level place between 83rd and 84th Street on 37th Avenue, next door to Joe &amp; Angeloâ€™s Barbers. <br /><br />There was an old time pharmacy, Palladinoâ€™s, on the southeast corner of Northern Boulevard and 82nd Street across from the Conway Funeral Home. &nbsp;Crossing over 82nd Street, still on the south side of Northern Boulevard was a Manufacturerâ€™s Trust Bank, The Tune Timers Club (a night spot) and an A&amp;P. &nbsp;On the opposite side of Northern Boulevard was the fire house and one of the two great toy stores I remember from the 1950â€™s, Aladdinâ€™s. The other toy store I remember being taken to was Gerstenhaberâ€™s on Roosevelt Avenue somewhere in the 80â€™s.<br /><br />On 37th Avenue between 82nd and 83rd Street were Womrathâ€™s Books and Florsheim Shoes. &nbsp;And across 37th Avenue from where Fieldâ€™s Department Store used to be on the northwest corner of 82nd Street was a huge Rexall drug store which subsequently housed the Jamaica Savings Bank when they moved from the northeast corner of 37th Avenue and 81st Street. &nbsp;On 82nd Street between 37th Avenue and Roosevelt, some of the major retailers included: &nbsp;Woolworthâ€™s, Kresgeâ€™s, Mishkin Drugs, Benjamin Shoes, Clarkâ€™s Department Store, Horn &amp; Hardart, Cushmanâ€™s Bakery, Regal Shoes, Miles Shoes, Simco Shoes, Harveyâ€™s Menâ€™s Wear, and Rauchâ€™s Childrenâ€™s Wear.<br /><br />

					(This is a continuation of an earlier post) &nbsp;My long time barber Sal, was the third chair at Joe &amp; Angelo&#039;s on 37th Avenue between 83rd and 84th Streets. Our regular Chinese restaurant was Moon Garden on the north side of Northern Boulevard between 89th and 90th Streets, the same block as Safeway Super Market which later became Dan&#039;s Supreme. On the northwest corner of 90th and Northern was a luncheonette. &nbsp;On the south side of Northern was &nbsp;Whelan Drugs, &nbsp;the Old Acquaintance Tavern, a liquor store, Dresswell Cleaners, a Kosher Deli, Kayar Bakery (later Pizza Sam&#039;s) and Joe&#039;s Candy Store (later Al&#039;s Candy Store).<br /><br />Between 87th and 88th Streets on the north side of Northern Boulevard was a Carvel and one block to the west, between 86th and 87th Streets was a hobby shop called Racarâ€™s which sold model kits, lanyard and crafts material and had a slot car track set up for the use of its patrons. <br /><br />My dentist was Dr. Bogart on 82nd Street between 34th and 35th Avenues, just across from the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights where I attended Hebrew school and became a Bar Mitzvah in 1964. RenÃ©e Paris who had a major supporting role in the 1974 film, The Lords of Flatbush was in my class at Pulitzer as was current U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder, Jr. To be continued.<br />

					My parents moved to Jackson Heights in June of 1951 when I was 6 weeks old.&nbsp; We lived at 86-11 34th Avenue until 1965, when we moved to 33-27 91st Street in Southridge.&nbsp; I attended P.S. 149, JHS 145 (Pulitzer), Newtown for one year and two years at The Garden School.&nbsp; I moved out of Jackson Heights in 1974 when I got married, but I return from time to time.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;ve established my street cred, let me share some of my recollections.&nbsp; <br /><br />Teachers at 149 included:&nbsp; Miss Jankowski, Miss Torsney, Mrs. Clark, Miss Vonderheid,&nbsp; Miss Hartman, Mrs. Blaha and Mrs. Brown.&nbsp; The principals were Miss Hearn and Mr. Price.&nbsp; At 145 my teachers included Mr. Horowitz (band and orchestra); Mrs. Rubin, Mr. Sloan and Mrs. Haines (math); Mrs. Hayes, Mrs. Seidenberg and Mrs. Galland (English); Mr. Bart, Mr. Brooker (science); Mr. Lipman and Mr. Barouh (social studies): Mrs. Tucker and Mr. Jehlen (French); Mr. Adolph (social dance); Mr. Antocicco and Mr. Sandler ( gym); Mr. Butler, Mr. Babb and Mr. Reddick (hygiene).&nbsp; The principal was Dr. Nagelberg and the assistant principals were Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bock. I also remember an Elmer Spiegler, but I don&#039;t remember what subject he taught.<br /><br />Jackson Heights had several movie theaters: The Boulevard on Northern and 83rd St. (my class at Pulitzer held its graduation there), the Colony on 82nd Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenue, the Earle on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th Streets, the Polk on 37th Avenue between 93rd and 94th Streets and the Fair on Astoria Boulevard between 90th and 91st Streets.&nbsp; Although technically in Elmhurst, the Jackson on 82nd Street south of Roosevelt Avenue was always considered to be one of the &#039;nabes&#039;. To be continued.
