					Not all movies in theaters are bad. And there is a certain ceremony to &quot;Going to the Movies&quot;. My first date with my husband was dinner and a movie. (eleven, not a million years ago.) When my husband and I need to feel like we&#039;re living a civilized life, we go to the movies. Look, with my schedule I stay in way too much to rest, but maybe if we all got out and did some social activities like going to the movies, then out for ice cream, we&#039;d be better off. But although it was hard enough to get a Starbucks in Jackson Heights, we&nbsp; really will never see another movie house here. The theater in Sunnyside recently closed, despite community protest.&nbsp; And that is extremely sad.

					Almondine, I appreciate that you may be apprehensive about having strangers in your home. Maria is honest to a fault, extremely reliable and considerate. She is a dear, dear human being and I would trust her in my home. Actually she keeps an eye out for my home, and I believe her presence makes my home more secure while I am out.

					Unless you grew up in Jackson Heights, just about everyone said similar things about the diversity of this place. Actually just look at the postings about the parades, food etc. After a year or so, it loses some of it&#039;s novelty. I lived in a working class neighborhood in the Bronx for thirty years but not in an exclusively Spanish neighborhood. My husband and I have been to Brazil many times on vacation and eaten their version of the empanada. When I first moved here (at the age of 43) and could find empanadas everywhere, it was very novel, like when I was on vacation to Brazil or Argentina. Is that dumb or insulting? No, actually it shows an appreciation for things that are different. Yes, she wishes she could have bloody maries in her own neighborhood in NYC, but she&#039;s not dissing the place. I think I&#039;ve seen the term colorful used appreciably on this message board. Maybe I&#039;m missing something.

					My husband, who spent his childhood in the Caribbean, loves brunch too. He also likes roti, because he grew up eating it. He is not Indian, but his favorite type of food is Indian. and his favorite dish, eggplant parm.&nbsp; My point is that he can like many things and not betray who is.

					When I first came to JH in 2006, my husband was one of the 5 percent of people who was not Hispanic, Caucasian or Asian. He is black. Neighborhood people would speak to him in Spanish and when he explained that his family was from a English speaking Caribbean island, they would tell him that he was lying and that he was ashamed to be Hispanic. That was not cool. My neighbors would tell me to get out because I was not Hispanic and Jackson Heights was only for Hispanic people.&nbsp; I am not making this up nor exaggerating.&nbsp; I now live in a different building which has many mixed everything (race, sexual orientation etc.) families. What a relief that was. There is no law that you have to be any one thing here. This is NYC. My family came to NYC with the potato famine, mother grew up in Corona, and I think I have a right to choose where I want to live. I choose someone from a different background than myself to marry and yet we have many things in common. (education etc.)<br /><br />&nbsp;And young people are coming to JH for affordable real estate. If they make a financial commitment to living here, there is no crime in wanting a place to have&nbsp; brunch, complete with bloody maries.

					She cannot have dogs in her apartment. She comes to my apartment and sits with my dog, routinely for hours at a time. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of sitters in my eight years as a dog owner, most of whom I really liked. I LOVE Maria, and trust her completely. If you are apprehensive about having a stranger&nbsp; in your home, buy a nanny cam. They come in a wide range of prices and functionality.

					Moving to Riverdale, for an easier commute on Metro North. Too many late mornings. With our long hours, my husband and I need a more reliable, easier way to get back and forth. If we were coming home at an earlier time, we&#039;d probably not be making this decision.<br /><br />Jackson Heights is a very lovely community, which got a bit dog-eared over the years. Gentrification is a definitely a mixed bag for any neighborhood, but hopefully it will bring with it better supermarkets, cleaner streets etc. for the people who live here. In my ten years here I have meet many wonderful people, which is JH&#039;s greatest strength. I will especially love the JH dog people, who create a micro-social community of their own.<br /><br />Maria is one of the loveliest, kindest and most responsible pet sitters I&#039;ve ever had. She has lived in Jackson Heights since the &#039;50s. My dog adores her, and I am sorry we can&#039;t manage to have her continue walk/watch our baby. We hope to bring her up to our new apartment to watch him on long weekends when we can&#039;t take our dog with us. I can&#039;t recommend her enough. she is more than a sitter, she is a friend to the animals. Again, please feel free to reach out to me, for any questions. I&#039;ll be in JH for a few more months.

					I am moving in a few months but I would like to pass along a recommendation for an extraordinary lady who has been taking care of my dog for the past two years. Her name is Maria Sroka and she sits with my dog each evening until I get home from work, sometimes quite late. (he has separation anxiety and while we probably overcompensate, she keeps him company. She walks him, feeds him, brushes him. If my husband and I have to go into work on weekends, she is most often available and will take care him until we can get home. She is loving, responsible, educated and cultured lady, who does pet sitting to bring in a little extra income, since she is retired. she always puts our dog first, and treats him with respect and care. She calls herself a pet nanny, and she is indeed. My dog loves her and we have grown very found of her too. We hope to see her after we move, but we hope that she can find a another family that will appreciate her as much as we have. She walks dogs, cat sits, takes car of birds and fish and waters plants. She can be reached at 718-898-0440. She has references besides ours but please feel free to send me a personal message if you want to know more about her.
