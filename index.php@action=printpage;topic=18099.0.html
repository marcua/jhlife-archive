				Good morning,<br /><br />We heard Paris Baguette is coming to Northern Blvd and 88th Street next to Red Wing shoes shop. Have anyone else heard of it? This is is so exciting! More options, more variety!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Patrick<br />

				it&#039;s a chain along the lines of Pret a Manger. pre-made sandwiches and salads that you grab out of refrigerator cases. i think Pret is better, but it&#039;s an adequate fast-food option.

				Actually, Paris Baguette is better known for their baked goods, especially French-Asian. They&#039;re pretty good.

				Oh joy!&nbsp; Comparing Paris Baguette to Fay Da and Cafe Bene are decent comparisons.&nbsp; This is a great step in an upscale directions.&nbsp; Most Paris Baguette locations are clean, provide a nice selection of coffees and baked goods, and comfortable seating.&nbsp; <br />

				I texted my wife at some point last week when I saw that it was coming soon, saying it was a game changer. Haha. Our son goes to the Children Of America on the next block, and sometimes I am at a loss for dinner, and frankly I’m tired of Chipotle. So, this is a win for us. Our son also happens to be a fan of French baked goods (who isn’t), despite never having been. So, really no downside for us.

				Au Bon Pain is very easy to find.&nbsp; Enter 79-01 Broadway, walk straight ahead down the hall, when you get to the elevator area walk downstairs two flights.&nbsp; Au Bon Pain is awesome.&nbsp; Incredible coffee, muffins, oatmeal with many toppings, breakfast sandwiches, regular sandwiches, several home made soups, salads, etc.&nbsp; Prices much lower than Manhattan - I&#039;m guessing they are subsidized by the hospital making prices affordable for hospital workers.&nbsp;

				Not sure. But they are already hiring staff. That being said, there are plenty of nice bakeries in the neighborhood. I’m growing fond of Lety’s. But there’s certainly no shortage.
