				on the surface, a BID seems like a great idea. I don&#039;t think anyone in their right mind could oppose cleaning up streets, adding lighting, and so on. I wonder, though, why some neighborhoods get these services for free -- without an extra fee for the merchants -- and others, like ours, are considered second class.

				dssjh, It is obvious that you are a person who is committed to the neighborhood. The last few days you have been a bit smarmy in your posts, calling people, things like &quot;doll&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;sweetie&quot; etc., including myself. You also tend to assume that people who are more conservative that you are from the suburbs, the midwest, or belong there. I think it&#039;s been a bit alienating, and I think that&#039;s what people are responding to. What&#039;s unusual, is that I&#039;ve only observed&nbsp; the &quot;sweetie&quot; thing the last couple of days. But I know you want the best for JH, it&#039;s so obvious.<br /><br />And being more conservative is not the same as trying to put people out of their homes. For years I lived in&nbsp; a cold water flat off Fordham Road in the Bronx. Now I own my apartment, and yes, I want my neighborhood to be better than when I was younger. Safer, cleaner etc. And I don&#039;t want to have to shop in Astoria or LIC, I want nice shops right here. You don&#039;t have to agree with me, but please don&#039;t call me &quot;doll&quot; if you don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I piss people off all the time too so if someone wants to call me out, go ahead.&nbsp; I apologize for any past transgressions.

				I think the reason I reverted to the anarcho-Disney princess thing was a few weeks of being told &quot;be silent&quot; and &quot;if you don&#039;t agree, keep your opinions to yourself.&quot; some people toss out four-letter words in response to that treatment, I use a more effective method.<br /><br />I guess that while I go along with just about everybody on things we need to work on -- traffic patterns, street noise, petty crime on Roosevelt, serious crime like sex trafficking, illegal housing -- I draw the line elsewhere. I have lived 47 years in urban settings with homeless people around. I have spent 42 or 43 of those actively speaking to and getting to know these people. my grandma would feed them around holidays when they came to the door asking. <br /><br />in terms of shopping, I don&#039;t really see many holes. yes, a few. a good Jewish deli, a good fish store, but I guess I think about my first 40 or so years of life. when neighborhoods were unique, and not every shopping strip had everything in the world. you&#039;d go get Chinese food one place, there were a dozen or more cheap French places on eighth ave in the 50s up until &#039;83 or so. egg creams all over the lower east side, great cheap steaks in the midst of the west side hooker district.<br /><br />but you didn&#039;t have people saying I want one from column a through column j all lined up nicely within 200 yards of my door or else I will be very unhappy. I don&#039;t want Jackson heights to become just another cipher.<br /><br />and in terms of the shopping, yeah, it could be nicer. for sure. but look around you when you&#039;re on the streets of JH. there are a LOT more people excited about mac and cheese going on sale 5 for a buck at foodtown than there are people getting excited about finding artisanal honey from new Zealand. and a lot more people looking for &#039;hoochie clothes&#039; than anne klein. perhaps 10 to one on each front.<br /><br />am I wrong on that? this board is not segregated racially or religiously, but it most certainly is, in terms of socioeconomics. does any of that seem reasonable?

				There&#039;s got to be some balance in this neighborhood and right now the retail corridor (besides banks and pharmacys) is at least 80 per cent low-end. People have invested in this community WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS and they deserve to have decent food sources (not just artisanal honey), safety, and fabric of life. We pay property taxes like the rest of the city so our expectations are going to be more than mac and cheese, even if we eat mac and cheese too. It&#039;s the American Dream to want more than mac and cheese, at least for your children. The doesn&#039;t mean the mac and cheese has&nbsp; to have truffles in it, just that the cheese should be real and the milk fresh.<br /><br />I can only speak for myself but I am not related to the Koch Brothers. (My mother grew up in Corona, and my grandparents owned a store.) But when I get on or off the 7 train, I want to see a clean, safe and pleasant place to call home. I&#039;ve been here 7 years, finally I&#039;m seeing signs that I might get it.<br /><br />And so that&#039;s what I want. You might think we already have these things, and that&#039;s fine, but I think we are capable of doing better.

				Thanks for posting the petition link I Live Here Too. Not that many people know about this petition.&nbsp; I will share this with my neighbors who I know would want to sign it. You would think there would also be some sort of mailing to the residents who live here on this matter.

				From what I understand from the article about the meeting with Moya the other evening, Seth Myers of the BID attended and said that they&#039;re trying to figure out about outreach to residents. Up until now, the focus has just been on merchants, but I think it is at least persuasive if merchants know how people in JH feel about cleaning up and improving Roosevelt.<br /><br />
