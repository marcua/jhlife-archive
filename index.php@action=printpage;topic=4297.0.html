				Hi. I&#039;d like someone to deep clean our small, two-bedroom apartment.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean basic dusting and vacuuming. I mean get the weird stains out of the inside of the microwave and off the shelves of the refrigerator. I want someone to clean the grout between the tiles in the shower, get the mildew off the bathroom ceiling, and clean the fuzz from the corners of the light switch. I want someone to clean *under* the bookshelves and TV cabinet, wash the windows and - I don&#039;t know - irradiate, or something, the thing that holds our cats&#039; litter box. Clean all the places people don&#039;t usually clean. No painting or repairs. Just cleaning.<br /><br />Our house isn&#039;t that disgusting, but we neglect all of these hard-to-reach and inconvenient areas.<br /><br />This would be a one-time thing, but it could periodically recur. Who can take on this task, and for how much?

				Hi,<br /><br />If you can, try and find someone to clean bi-weekly after you&#039;ve had the major cleaning done.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be worth it for you and the family.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley6600:

				A regular cleaning of a two bedroom apartment can be in the $100 range.&nbsp; This cleaning looks like a $250+ cleaning but I am only guessing.&nbsp; Don&#039;t expect perfect results cleaning the grout between the tiles.&nbsp; That would require scrubbing each inch of grout with a small brush.&nbsp; Certainly a tedious and labor intensive job.

				www.nymagiccleaningco.com <br /><br />I think this is the website address of the New York Magic Cleaning Company.<br /><br />They were awesome! Sent 3 people, with all tools, chemicals (organic) and spent 5 hours. They did windows, bookcases, washed down walls of kitchen and bathroom, places I never would have thought about. <br /><br />The apartment was spotless.<br /><br />Cost about $300.
