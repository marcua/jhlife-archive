				Yesterday at about 1 PM, I was near Aroma Brazil (food sold by weight) and I decided to bring home some lunch.&nbsp; I took home a small container of mixed grilled vegetables&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got to the register, I was surprised at a price of $11.60 including tax.&nbsp; I have a kitchen scale at home and the container weight was 12.6 ounces.&nbsp; This was my first visit to this buffet style restaurant.&nbsp; The food was very good but not the price.&nbsp; If there was a sign indicating price per pound, I didn&#039;t notice it.&nbsp;

				there are several signs indicating per pound prices in the place. i know there&#039;s one near the buffet itself, and i think there&#039;s one by the register. there&#039;s a surcharge if you take only seafood, but i don&#039;t think there&#039;s a discount for purchasing only salad bar items, which there really should be.

				It&#039;s good but not cheap. You have to be somewhat strategic with these places.<br /><br />And there is a discount for only salad. Ask or check the signs. There are different prices for salad, bbq, meat, and salmon/shrimp. If you mix, they probably charge you for the most expensive thing. I usually do two dishes.

				Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I plan on returning but this time I&#039;ll look for the prices plus I&#039;ll ask the cashier the price before lI make a selection.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t like what I hear, I&#039;ll leave.&nbsp;

				sounds like 9.99 / lb<br /><br /><br />diff price rotisseries / salmon / salad only<br /><br /><br />You should be mindful that this is per pound and don&#039;t stock up on liquid based items. You can get plenty of meats on the salad bar - that&#039;s what I always used to get unless I was feeling celebratory. There is another place like this on Roosevelt but this salad bar here is far supreme
