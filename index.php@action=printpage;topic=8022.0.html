				I&#039;ve noticed that a number of the buildings in JH have garages but there is invariably a wait for a parking space. I&#039;m wondering if anyone has any insight into just how long this wait typically is. Are these spaces desperately coveted? Does the wait extend for years? My sense is that for some reason parking in buildings throughout Queens is grossly underpriced, leading to excess demand and (in effect) subsidies from non-parkers to parkers. Thanks for any insights!

				Mind you that this was over ten years ago...I parked my car in one of the buildings that had a garage and waited a short amount of time...maybe 2-3 months before geting a space. Check in with one of the superindendants or if you know someone that lives in a building with a gargage. Things do turnover. There appears to be no wait list so it on a first come first serve basis. Good luck.

				We have a huge list of over 100 people for our complex. Estimates are anywhere from 8-10 years. However, once you get it, it&#039;s only $70 a month, which is ridiculously cheap. <br />Only 6-8 years to go!
