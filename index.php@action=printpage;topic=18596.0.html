				Hi all.&nbsp; I live on the Q47 &amp; Q49 route, and I have a problem with them blowing their horns all hours of the day and night.<br /><br />(For clarity, they&#039;re not blowing their horns for safety reasons -- they honk THE MOMENT that the traffic light turns green.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve filed a complaint with NYC buses, but I doubt that&#039;ll have much affect.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also e-mailed councilperson Daniel Dromm (his office is also on the same bus route) asking that his office contact someone in charge of bus drivers at the 74th street subway station.&nbsp; I offered an alternative to honking -- if the drivers would just flash their bright lights, it would alert the cars in front of them without disturbing hordes of people in the vicinity.<br /><br />Maybe if they receive many requests for this, it&#039;ll be taken more seriously.&nbsp; Mr Dromm&#039;s e-mail address is: dromm@council.nyc.gov

				As a follow-up, here is where you can send a complaint to the MTA, and request that the bus drivers flash their bright lights instead of blowing their horns:&nbsp; https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask (https://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask)

				Who you should also complain to is the DOT.&nbsp; There should be someone there stopping drivers form double parking and making illegal u turns as to block busses from their run.&nbsp; The bus drivers are doing their jobs.&nbsp; As a commuter, I wish the bus&nbsp; drivers were able to take pictures and give a summons to whomever is blocking traffic.&nbsp; You&#039;d hear a lot less honking then.

				Better yet, maybe the best way to complain about honk-happy bus drivers is by Tweeting to <strong>NYCTBus</strong>.<br />
