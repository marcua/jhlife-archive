				Hi, I noticed around lunchtime that my tap water is brown, I am not exaggerating, it is disgusting. I am wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same thing. I saw a DEP crew who seem to be working on 37th Ave and 85th Street, close to an open fire hydrant, and I am wondering if that may have anything to do with the water quality. <br /><br />Any thoughts?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Someone posted a similar question a while back, and the few replies did mention nearby construction.<br /><br />Did your building temporarily shut off the water for repair work?&nbsp; That&#039;s about the only time I&#039;ve seen brownish water come out of our faucets.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a link to the previous discussion:<br /><br />Brownish water--is it safe?

				Update: I just spoke to the DEP crew working outside. They were doing some repairs and had shut off the main valve, limiting supply to whatever was already in the pipes. They are now done and water should be back to normal shortly. Just run the cold water for a few minutes.<br /><br />

				I found out that my tap water was brown since November 2009, and I made complaints to 311 through DEP. DEP noticed that the water pipe was broken in Flushing, but my tap water is still brown.

				the water in my bathroom (bathtub mostly) always comes out brown first and then becomes clear after a few seconds of running. in my case, i&#039;m thinking it&#039;s an old faucet issue but who knows..

It turns out that the source of the brown water is often rusty, underutilized water pipes - most frequently the bathtub pipes (most people take showers) or pipes in units that are empty at the moment. For whatever reason, sometimes water loops into these rusty pipes, picks up sediment, and then continues to it&#039;s final destination...where you see it. <br /><br />If you have this problem, _______ suggested running your tub, or checking with ______ to find out if any apartments in your line are empty. &nbsp;______ can go in and run the water if that is the case. ______ also said people who don&#039;t use their tubs at all might want to run the water once and awhile. I guess some pipes are rustier than others. &nbsp; <br /><br />One person emailed me offline and said the situation has improved. We have not had this problem since either. I know it&#039;s not a permanent solution - but a bigger fix is likely far off.&quot; <br /><br />Best, &nbsp; :smiley6600:<br /><br />

				I had this problem when I lived in Manhattan and I called the landlord and he told me it was due to construction in the area and just let the water run for a bit.&nbsp; Well, I never bought that explanation and I hated the murky water coming through the bathtub spigot and the showerhead.&nbsp; It was very noticeable when I was out of town for a week and came back and turned the water on.&nbsp; I complained several times and was told that was just the way it was.&nbsp; Well, one day, the super came up and he had a big piece of plumbing in his hand that was caked with rust and gunk and he said &quot;Oh, you were right, there was something wrong with the pipes!&quot;&nbsp; If I remember correctly, it was called a thermocoupler or coupling valve or something that had to do with the water heater and that was where the disgusting brown water was coming from.&nbsp; Landlords and supers will tell you a problem is your imagination until they find out that it really was something wrong.&nbsp; Not much you can do about that, though!
