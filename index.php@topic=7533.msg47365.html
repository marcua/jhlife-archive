								<div class="inner" id="msg_46543">Development will damage Flushing Meadowsâ€™ role as marshy buffer against storm surge and coastal flooding<br />Natural protections need to be enhanced<br /><br />BY JASON MUNSHI-SOUTH / NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br /><br />MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2012, 4:00 AM<br /><img src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1212054.1354501348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/gst03q-2-web.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />The park acts as a natural sponge for tidal surges and stormwater runoff. It is a flood protection area â€” protecting our neighborhood (and basements) from serious flooding during big storms.<br /><br />Because Bloomberg understands climate change so well, it is baffling that his administration has signed on to development plans for Flushing Meadows that are alarming â€” the construction of new stadiums, roads, parking lots and a massive mall in the park.<br />These construction projects will substantially increase the percentage of impervious surface cover (materials that do not absorb water) in the park as green spaces are converted to structures (stadiums and malls) and concrete roads, parking lots and walkways. Any gains against pollution runoff and flooding in the Meadow and Willow Lake watershed will be damaged by these developments, and storm runoff into Flushing Bay will likely increase.<br /><br />Such development will also further damage Flushing Meadowsâ€™ historical role as a marshy buffer against storm surge and coastal flooding, placing residents and businesses located near Flushing Meadows in a more vulnerable position during extreme weather events. Do the developers of the soccer stadium have plans to address the potential damage from flooding to surrounding neighborhoods wrought by their work?<br /><br />Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is no stranger to bold plans that usher in major changes. However, these new developments resemble the worst excesses of Robert Moses rather than his success in originally creating the park. True boldness requires further protective wetland restoration in the park. In 2002, the Gaia Institute prepared a plan to connect Meadow and Willow Lakes, dramatically increase the amount of wetlands they contain, and bring stormwater drainage above ground as part of a restored marsh ecosystem, a approach called â€œdaylighting.â€<br />These changes would be a great start toward improving water quality, bringing nature recreation opportunities to underserved communities and protecting the park and surrounding areas from the impacts of severe weather.<br /><br />The continued suffering of our neighbors after Superstorm Sandy is the most visible illustration of just how deeply unwise it is to continue degrading coastal marsh areas like Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.<br /><br /><em><strong>Dr. Jason Munshi-South is an assistant professor of Environmental Science and Biology in the Department of Natural Science at Baruch College. As a resident of Jackson Heights, he enjoys frequent visits to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park with his wife and two children.</strong></em><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/flushing-meadows-plans-aren-sound-article-1.1212056#ixzz2E0Wd3qgB" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/flushing-meadows-plans-aren-sound-article-1.1212056#ixzz2E0Wd3qgB</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_46544">&nbsp;I would suggest that Dr. Munshi-South get in touch with the Queens Botanical Garden as they have had <br />huge problems in the past with exactly the same thing, the natural marshland, and how to deal with it.<br />The Botanical Garden is such an asset in this densely used park that I applaud their efforts to integrate<br />development and environmental concerns in urban areas like ours. And I think that their parking lot<br />area with a surface designed to use absorb the water, provide useable surfaces where needed and <br />encourage growth of native plants is fantastic and very forward thinking. Much as I love trees, some<br />of the enormous trees that fell in the whole tri-state area should make us rethink what trees are <br />planted and where because of the sponge effect that the author points outs in this article. <br />&nbsp; The MLS would be a great partner in this, I imagine, because the critical importance of the playing surface<br />in the game. Why not suggest a review of all the paved surfaces in the whole of Flushing Meadows<br />to see if they can be re-worked similar to the Queens Botanical Gardens? This would have to go a long<br />way towards alleviating this problem and I am not sure NY Parks has the budget for this especially<br />after Sandy.<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_46545">I was talking to someone pretty plugged in to various issues recently and he had an interesting word that I hadn&#039;t been thinking about. He said, &quot;The MLS is the least evil here. People aren&#039;t worried enough about the tennis.&quot;<br /><br />From his discussions, MLS wants to draw a lot of its core buyers from Queens and is very concerned about local buy-in. But tennis, to be completely blunt, doesn&#039;t care two craps about the area, because its buyers are primarily from Manhattan and Connecticut. USTA also thinks of the park as something to be disposed of at will by the Bloomberg administration, sees zero value in existing uses, and sees local residents as invisible slum-dwellers. My interlocutor seemed to think that the tennis proposal involved a lot more in terms of roads and paving than they&#039;re letting on.<br /><br />I&#039;m still for the &quot;divide to conquer&quot; approach here - finding a way to partner with MLS to block tennis and the shopping mall, for instance.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_46569"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Queens Chronicle Editorial:<br />MLS stadium doesnâ€™t belong in our park</strong></span><br /><br />Soccer coaches often say controlling the ball and dictating the pace of play are integral to winning games. It appears Major League Soccer has adopted the same tactics when it comes to its proposed 25,000-seat stadium in the heart of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. This paper took a look at the leagueâ€™s initial proposal and gave it casual backing. No more.<br /><br />Simply put, we cannot understand why the league insists on setting up shop on public property, in a park utilized on any given weekend by thousands of borough residents. This atop a whole litany of lingering concerns.<br /><br />We are dismayed by a largely muddled outreach process embodied most recently by allegations of muted dissent at a â€œtown hall meetingâ€ on Tuesday. Our editor found troubling evidence the event was something more akin to a pep rally than an airing of ideas. A sign-in sheet was allegedly used to filter out the rabble. Pro-stadium groups were given an early invite and priority seating. And the theatrics of a crowd draped in MLS regalia and holding up pro-stadium poster boards was largely fabricated.<br /><br />Questions about the feasibility of building a stadium on a swamp will remain until MLS explains in detail how it will manage to build a stadium in an area where the water table is three feet below the surface at most, according to the 2006 U.S. Geological Survey map. Those concerns are only magnified by the proposed parking facility â€” not for public use â€” below the stadium, which we presume will be a wonder of water-repellent engineering.<br /><br />The league is also ignoring the lack of parking for fans, a problem anyone who frequents the park during the U.S. Open can attest to. While we respect MLSâ€™s traffic advisor, our own contributor Sam Schwartz, his projections that 50 percent of fans will take mass transit still leaves thousands of people driving to games. Where will they park?<br /><br />Most troubling is the still-unspecified replacement parkland, a major sticking point for many. Yes, the league is required to replace every inch of parkland, but there are no rules mandating it be in our borough. MLS is in the throes of a search, though that process has been closed to public input.<br /><br />Weâ€™re assuming the parkland it ultimately chooses will be safe, clean, close to a populace that will utilize it and accessible. So â€¦ why not build the darn stadium there?<br /><br />The leagueâ€™s argument that the worldâ€™s sport needs a home in the heart of our borough simply doesnâ€™t score many goals with us. We still donâ€™t have a complete list of other sites MLS was considering before it chose our park. Why not consider the myriad of pesky, unused sites around our borough, places that need an infusion of life and vitality? Something like the old Flushing Airport, Aqueduct Racetrack or the old home of the U.S. Open in Forest Hills?<br /><br />Weâ€™re left wondering how serious the league is about its repeated odes to collaboration and community input.<br />This is not a call to end all discussions of an MLS stadium in our borough. Far from it.<br /><br />The stadiumâ€™s estimated $60 million in annual economic activity, 150 permanent jobs and host of other economic benefits are nothing to overlook, in any economic climate.<br /><br />But the cost is too much. Itâ€™s a price that rejuvenated soccer fields, fixed fountains and an updated water management infrastructure cannot cover. Besides, donâ€™t we pay taxes so the Parks Department can handle those improvements? The cityâ€™s silence on this issue is deafening.<br /><br />Commissioner, youâ€™re a Queens guy. Câ€™mon. Itâ€™s our park. Itâ€™s yours too. Youâ€™re welcome to use it â€” like the rest of us.<br /><br />Itâ€™s time you and your league go back to a map and find another location.<br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/mls-stadium-doesn-t-belong-in-our-park/article_c3d92895-d251-54e8-b122-e6b39d4955b9.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/mls-stadium-doesn-t-belong-in-our-park/article_c3d92895-d251-54e8-b122-e6b39d4955b9.html</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_46818">&nbsp;I agree with Sen. Peralta here. The article seems to have taken into account a number of factors with the park, its current use,<br />the proposed site, environmental issues, business concerns and the neighborhood love and involvement with the game. In the end,<br />I also believe this is a great asset, a Major League Soccer stadium, that will hopefully come to Flushing Meadows Park. I would <br />like to also ask of the Senator to post details of the type of academy team here for our high level youth players, male and <br />female, that are usually part of the league proposals. And to actively pursue a women&#039;s team for the stadium as well. It sounds<br />like the Senator has done his homework with his constituents and this is what he and they believe to be the best choice.<br />&nbsp;As a staunch environmentalist, I also believe we can work with this organization and as previous posts have mentioned, it&#039;s tennis <br />who doesn&#039;t give a damn about the locals and they have two stadiums already! The mall proposal is a joke - but you can see with <br />the retail figures posted from Queens Center mall nearby the appeal to business people who would like to duplicate those very<br />successful results. Just because they asked, doesn&#039;t mean they has to be taken seriously. As we all know, we are fine with Target<br />stores in the area, thank you very much. But soccer stadiums and much improved fields and cleanup of Flushing Meadows Park, <br />now there is an authentic need. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_46832">In a perfect world, Flushing Meadows Park would get the same kind of attention/upkeep as Central or Prospect Park, but that&#039;s not going happen. So we have to decide which is better, 100% of poorly maintained parkland or some lesser percent of quality parkland. The tennis and mall developments don&#039;t make sense to me, but I think MLS would be a positive addition to the area and we&#039;d have a higher quality park. We just have to make sure the agreement has some teeth, and the developer can&#039;t just ignore quality of life concessions, which seems to happen every time we get promised something.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_47355">Queens Chronicle Editorial: <strong>Flushing Meadows soccer stadium must be stopped</strong><br /><br />Major League Soccer is doing its best to rush a misguided plan to build a stadium in Queens through all the hurdles it faces before Mayor Bloomberg leaves office. It cannot be allowed to succeed.<br /><br />League officials have been given every opportunity to be forthcoming about the important details of their proposal and to counter their critics, and they refuse to do so. A similar project they got approved in Harrison, NJ, just over the Hudson River, has failed to live up to its promises and ended up shorting that townâ€™s taxpayers at least $3.6 million.<br /><br />And, above all, their plan for a stadium in Flushing Meadows Corona Park would severely damage what remains the crown jewel of Queens, without enough benefit to residents.<br /><br />The deal MLS seeks with the city would be a steal, literally, in all but the legal sense. It wants a $1 a year lease for up to 13 acres of public parkland â€” the classic deal politicians and private for-profit businesses cook up behind closed doors to take the citizensâ€™ property without compensation.<br /><br />That deal, which must be stopped, is at the heart of why MLS is in such a rush. If it doesnâ€™t get public land essentially for free, the league will have to buy the 10 to 13 acres it needs for a 25,000 seat arena on the open market.<br /><br />All that the public would get in exchange is 13 acres of new parkland somewhere else â€”but not all in one chunk â€” and the rehab of some existing soccer fields at Flushing Meadows, which should be a city job anyway. MLS also says it would invest tens of millions of dollars in the park, but itâ€™s vague as to how and where, as it is on so many details, even when its president met with us last week.<br /><br />One of the most frustrating vagaries is the leagueâ€™s site selection process. MLS is dead set on building a stadium in Flushing Meadows, mostly because the land would be free but also because there are so many Latin Americans in nearby neighborhoods and soccer is such a force in that culture, and because of all the transportation options that get people to the park. But we donâ€™t see why a stadium couldnâ€™t be considered for any number of other locations, such as Aqueduct Race Track or the old Flushing Airport, and MLS has not been forthcoming in what other sites it rejected or why.<br /><br />We are not against soccer in Queens; in fact we would welcome it. We are against giving away our parkland. Imagine, as crazy as it sounds, that this project had been proposed for Central Park. Of course it would be rejected out of hand. But if the mayor wants a stadium, maybe he should consider putting it there, in his own neighborhoodâ€™s crown jewel park.<br /><br />Another major concern with the proposal is the question of team ownership, one of many issues discussed in this weekâ€™s Queens Chronicle story â€œMLS to Queens? Stop by Harrison, NJ first.â€ The league has yet to select an owner for the team it would locate here, but that means accountability would be hard to pursue should any problems arise as the stadium is built. And the one possible owner thatâ€™s been reported on in the press is an Arab oil sheik, a prospect we find troubling. If a Queens soccer team were to go belly up, as two MLS teams have in recent years, what would he care about an empty stadium nearly half a world away?<br /><br />Standard political practice means there is one person who could stop this project today if she wants to: City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, whose district includes the northern section of the park. She should see this proposal for the land grab that it is. If she says no to it, the rest of the Council will follow suit, and the plan will be denied â€” if MLS doesnâ€™t just give up on its own first. We urge you to call Ferreras at (718) 651-1917 or (212) 788-6862, or email her at <a href="mailto:jferreras@council.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">jferreras@council.nyc.gov</a>, and tell her to keep our park in our hands. MLS can come back with a better site any time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/flushing-meadows-soccer-stadium-must-be-stopped/article_e233d216-4a31-5b54-aa1b-051b8c2233e5.html?TNNoMobile" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/flushing-meadows-soccer-stadium-must-be-stopped/article_e233d216-4a31-5b54-aa1b-051b8c2233e5.html?TNNoMobile</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_47365">I&#039;m amazed that something like this is even on the table. As others have said this would never happen in Central Park, Prospect Park, or any park surrounded by people with social capital to burn. People who live near Flushing Meadows Corona Park - one of the city&#039;s most beautiful, under-appreciated parks - don&#039;t have the money or time to mobilize the way the Upper West Side moms did when Robert Moses tried to turn a Central Park playground into a parking lot back in the 60&#039;s. As a result, Bloomberg and his cronies figure they can just steamroll over any opposition. For wealthy Manhattanites, no harm done; for them, Flushing Meadows Park is a place to come to once a year for tennis, and the rest of the year, it might as well not exist.<br /><br />Speaking of tennis, even the presence of the existing Tennis Center in the park is utterly egregious. Western Queens has just about zero parkland other than Flushing Meadows, so to restrict even a square inch to two-weeks-a-year paid admission is ridiculous.<br /><br />And don&#039;t even get me started on a mall. As if the existing malls in Flushing and Rego Park aren&#039;t enough.<br /><br />Memo to Bloomberg: NYC is not a corporation. Maximizing profits per square foot is not the appropriate function of a public servant.<br /></div>

On Friday morning, several of them blasted the proposed expansion at a press conference. The five candidates—ex-Councilwoman Melinda Katz, Councilman Leroy Comrie, state Sen. Tony Avella, state Sen. Jose Peralta and Councilman Peter Vallone Jr.—put their names to a statement blasting the USTA for not planning to replace 0.68 acres of parkland to become part of the tennis grounds. The borough president will issue an advisory opinion on the expansion during the city review process, although it is not clear if that will happen before or after the office changes hands in January.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130308/BLOGS04/130309861" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130308/BLOGS04/130309861</a><br /></div>

Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is under siege with three corporate development proposals that, if approved, will harm the park and potentially destroy its usefulness to the community as a public green space. The proposals to build a shopping mall, a soccer stadium, and an expanded USTA site will reduce this already vulnerable park to being merely a corporate sports complex that is increasingly dominated by automobiles and trucks. <br /><br />But we can make a difference. Just like we did with the PlayStreet and the Garden School field. That is where you come in. <br /><br /><strong>We need you to come out on Monday, April 22nd at 7:30pm to the Queens Museum of Art for a community workshop on Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. This is your opportunity to share your vision for this park.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_48317">I was able to attend this workshop on Monday and I thought it was a very organized and positive overall. There was a great turnout and, like myself, I think the majority in attendance were against all of the proposed developments. <br /><br />Here is an article from the Queens Chronicle about the event:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/searching-for-a-new-vision-of-fmcp/article_c3aa3607-e913-5869-a92d-a62eb0b6405c.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/searching-for-a-new-vision-of-fmcp/article_c3aa3607-e913-5869-a92d-a62eb0b6405c.html</a><br /><br />As mentioned in the article above, City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras is proposing a Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Alliance similar to the Central Park Conservancy and the Prospect Park Alliance:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/public-private-alliance-proposed-flushing-meadows-article-1.1326515" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/public-private-alliance-proposed-flushing-meadows-article-1.1326515</a><br /><br />During the meeting I was under the impression that this would be something new for the park and I thought it was odd that there was not currently such a group. After doing a little research I found that there is a FMCP Conservancy already in existence, which is also mentioned in the Queens Chronicle article above. I&#039;m a little confused as to why a new group is being formed instead of working with the conservancy. It seems that I am not alone:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/pat-dolan-and-the-park-she-loved/article_277242c9-b0b8-5dd0-8bc3-17789e9535f1.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/pat-dolan-and-the-park-she-loved/article_277242c9-b0b8-5dd0-8bc3-17789e9535f1.html</a><br /><br />One of the most interesting components of this event was when those of us in attendance broke into smaller groups and discussed what we love about FMCP, what we would like to see changed or improved, and what we do not want to see in FMCP. It was great to hear everyone&#039;s ideas and to share my own. After the meeting I came across the FMCP Strategic Framework Plan which I believe was released in 2008. Many of the ideas discussed at my table as well as in the rest of the workshop are present in this plan. It can be found on NYC Parks&#039; website: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fmcp" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fmcp</a><br /><br />One person at my table mentioned restoring the Flushing River which currently runs underground through much of the park. I had no idea. This is also mentioned in the plan above and this would also result in the creation of a new festival grounds space which would be twice the size of Central Park&#039;s Great Lawn. This would be in the same location as the proposed soccer stadium and I think a much better idea for this space.<br /><br /><img src="http://mazeartist.com/ovalpk.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div>
