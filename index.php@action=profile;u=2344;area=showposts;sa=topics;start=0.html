					Just a heads up, check how much you&#039;re being charged for things if you shop at Maynard Farms (the fruit vendor with apples, cider, berries, etc.) at the Greenmarket. I was charged $2.50/lb for something that was $2/lb and paid about $2 more than I should have. I asked the vendor about it and he said the price was $2.50 despite the sign saying $2. <br /><br />I know farmers are struggling but they&#039;ve gotta charge the posted prices. I&#039;m fortunate that $2 isn&#039;t a huge deal to me, but maybe it is to others, like the people in line ahead of me who were paying with Snap vouchers. I would have been totally fine paying $2.50/lb but the person was so rude about it and was implying that I lied about the sign (I went back and checked! I was right!) that I&#039;ll never shop there again. Too bad, because I&#039;m gonna need to find another vendor that sells apples year round!<br />

					Just a heads up, my car got broken into sometime between Sunday night and Wednesday afternoon. It was parked in the low 70&#039;s between 37th &amp; 34th. They took a few low-value things (total about $100) and rifled through the glove box, console, and the trunk. Fortunately they didn&#039;t break any glass, I may have left the car unlocked accidentally. Anyone else experience anything similar lately?

					Alert! There&#039;s a new Starbucks going into the space where Coral Pet Food was. Looks like construction is happening and the neon sign is up outside.<br /><br />Would have loved a locally-owned shop to go into that space, but it&#039;ll be nice to grab coffee there vs. from Dunkin on the way to the train.

					According to 311 the sidewalks should have been cleared by 11am today. Most notably for me, the sidewalk in front of the Bruson Building, which takes up an entire block, was not cleared AT ALL by 2:45pm on Sunday. Thought about contacting Danny Dromm, then I walked a bit further and noticed that the sidewalk in front of his building wasn&#039;t cleared, either. Where are the property owners? Who can we contact to get this taken care of? One or two storefronts is manageable, an entire block is not.

					Last night while driving on Roosevelt Ave there was a NYPD checkpoint set up for cars driving westbound on Roosevelt at around 93rd. St. I waited in a long line of cars who were also being stopped, and when I finally got up to the cop who was stopping people I was asked for my license. I handed over my license and asked what I was being stopped for. He looked over my license and said that they were just stopping people to check licenses. After looking over my license he sent me on my way. I&#039;ve got a valid license, car is registered and insured, no reason to worry, etc., and I was pretty shaken up. I&#039;ve never encountered this before. How frequently does this happen here in JH? Is this something new? Why are they doing this? Anyone have any insight into this checkpoint practice? Is it even legal to be stopped while driving and asked for ID without cause (or, not to be told what the reason for the checkpoint is)?<br />

					Figured I&#039;d ask the folks on here what the &quot;protocol&quot; is for grabbing a street parking spot. Last night I was coming home and was double parked waiting for a spot. About 3 cars back someone started their car to pull out. I backed up a bit, put on my blinker (not my hazards, just my blinker), and gave the exiting car enough room to pull out. Before the other car pulled out, a third car pulled up behind the car that was pulling away; as soon as the exiting car moved out of their spot the third car zoomed into the spot and grabbed it. I was there for longer and I had my blinker on and had backed up a bit, in my mind both of these are indicators that I was about to pull into the spot. So I pulled up next to the car and asked what they were doing and why they took the spot when it was clear that I was there first and was about to park there. The passenger in the car (the driver remained silent) insisted that it was &quot;protocol&quot; that you wait immediately behind the exiting car if you are going to take their spot. He insisted that he didn&#039;t know that I was waiting for the spot and that &quot;I could be doing anything&quot; and &quot;he didn&#039;t know if I was waiting for somebody&quot; etc etc since I was up ahead. I said no, if I was just standing, loading/unloading, etc. I would have had my hazards on, not my blinker, and not in a position to take the spot. The person was incredibly rude and insisted that &quot;everyone&quot; knows that the parking &quot;protocol&quot; is that you wait behind the exiting car. <br />I&#039;ve *never* heard this supposed parking &quot;protocol&quot; and have seen people both ahead and behind of the exiting car take a spot. Often it&#039;s not possible to get behind the exiting car because of other moving vehicles, buses, etc. on the street (and it kind of doesn&#039;t make sense, since the majority of the time you&#039;re pulling in backwards to parallel park and need to be in front of the exiting car anyway).<br />So - what&#039;s the deal here? Is there some sort of unwritten rule about street parking that I don&#039;t know about? If so, why has it not been made apparent in my X number of years living in JH and parking in NYC in general? I know that you can&#039;t save a spot, etc., but when someone is within 3 cars of the exiting car and has their blinker on, to my mind, it&#039;s pretty obvious that they&#039;re waiting for the car to leave.
