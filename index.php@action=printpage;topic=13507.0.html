				I was going up 34th Avenue yesterday and found the divider mall a real eye sore. The weeds were not only healthy, but 3 and 4 foot high in places! One block actually had six or so black hefty bags just left there. God only knows what was in them!<br /><br />For the most part there are only 2 buildings per block, one on each side of the Avenue. You&#039;d think 2 buildings could organize a maintaince schedule. Afterall, it is their view!<br />

				&nbsp;Agreed! The weeds are three feet high in some places. I do hope that neighbors take the initiative to weed this median<br />strip because the NYC Parks Dept is trying. Those black bags are theirs, by the way, but they don&#039;t make much progress <br />in a day with the 25 blocks. Our building maintains the strip in front of us which was in the initial plan and tools were <br />given to buildings agreeing to help the process of caring for the strip. Obviously some have reneged on the arrangement.<br />&nbsp; NYC Parks is also going to be responsible for maintaining the new green hill/lawn in the Travers redesign. Or will it also<br />be neglected? A waiting game...

				I often drive around and notice garbage everywhere, overgrown weeds and I think to myself I should be out there &quot;cleaning up&quot; instead of complaining about it. I&#039;m not doing it alone so if anyone wants to help clean up the neighborhood, I am down.

				If you see garbage bags thrown randomly, you can and should complain to 311 http://www1.nyc.gov/311/index.page <br /><br />One of the big reasons why other places are so clean is that the people complain a lot. <br />

				I&#039;m down too for keeping a clean neighborhood. I can&#039;t walk around without noticing garbage everywhere. I know we can do much more as a community to have a cleaner and even better Jackson Heights.

				&nbsp;What if this was the week to make it right? Pull weeds, take out the trash stuck in the bushes and maybe plant a thing<br />or two? I&#039;m down here too.

				JHBG would be happy to organize a cleanup of the 34th Avenue mall. Please contact us at volunteer@jhbg.org with 34th AVENUE MALL in the subject line. When we get a sufficient number of volunteers willing to spend at least three hours on two Saturdays, we will set this up. I’m thinking of this happening the second half of this month.<br /><br />Please reach out by the end of this weekend. We need to coordinate this with other activities we’re doing such as the NYC Tree Census. <br /><br />Thank you and all the best.<br /><br />Len Maniace<br />JHBG President
