				Welcome to the Jackson Heights Life Photo Contest!&nbsp; We are looking for one or more excellent photographs to use on the banner of our website.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from the tradition of our sister site, Astorians, here are the rules for our contest:<br /><br />1. Two submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />2. Your image should be in digital format, taken with at LEAST at 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality.<br />3. Photos should not portray identifiable individuals.<br />4. A small version of your image should be posted to this thread with a brief description of what it is.<br />5. The contest starts immediately and will run until March 30, 2008. At that time the contest will be closed to new entries.<br />6. In early April, we will vote on the submitted images.<br />7. One or more winners will be announced and the graphics will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />Your image will run for a period of weeks or months. It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Horizonal composition is preferred -- we need a wide and narrow section of the photo to serve as the banner.&nbsp; On the bottom right hand corner we&#039;ll add your name/username/link/email whatever you want so people can link or contact you. Obviously you are giving us permission to use your image on the Jackson Heights Life homepage by your submission.<br />

				FYI, there are two ways to post photos on this site.<br /><br />The first way is to upload them to another site, like Flickr or Photobucket, and link to the image from here.&nbsp; I explained how to do this over here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=374.msg1700#msg1700).<br /><br />The second way is to attach a file directly to your post.&nbsp; At the bottom of the page, click on &quot;Additional Options,&quot; and then enter the filename in the box next to &quot;Attach:&quot;.&nbsp; Files must be smaller than 128 kB.

				Thanks!<br /><br />I took the picture because the lighting was so unusual at that moment.&nbsp; It was late in the afternoon, so the big tree in the courtyard was in shadow.&nbsp; But because of a gap between the buildings, the closer tree was brightly lit from the side.&nbsp; It looked even better in person.

				You can substitute any new photos you want, just post them here.<br /><br />There&#039;s really no need to crop them in advance.&nbsp; For example, the winning photo in the most recent contest at Astorians was from this post (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=8653.msg106816#msg106816)... it was fairly easy to imagine how it might be cropped.<br /><br />In the case of the photo I posted, I had a specific idea in mind for how I wanted to rotate and crop it that might not have been obvious, so I did crop it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Either way, it&#039;s up to you.&nbsp; If you post something new and want me to take down the old ones, let me know.<br /><br />

				why not use a group of photos on a rotating basis? i&#039;ve seen this on other sites, www.coolhunting.com is one. their banner photo changes randomly every time you go to the site (by coincidence on of the pix in their rotation is of roosevelt ave in j.h.) and if you roll your cursor over the photo it gives the name of the photographer. perhaps this is technically too complicated, but it seems like a nice way of giving a comprehensive picture of the neighborhood in terms of area (residential, business) and season (winter and summer), etc.

				So far we&#039;ve preferred to have photo submissions, have the community vote on the best one, and then use that as the exclusive banner for some period of time. Not all the photos submitted here or on Astorians are suitable for the header, and by having a pool of photos it increases the complexity of choosing which ones are worthy and which ones aren&#039;t. If we get to a point where we have many many submissions it might be more realistic to have several winning photos and rotate through those.<br /><br />If the site were a photo-centric site (like a gallery, or photo sharing site) I&#039;d feel differently for sure.<br /><br />BTW, keep in mind that the winning photo is going to be cropped heavily to fit into the header. The picture may end up looking a lot different than you&#039;re seeing it in 4x3 mode in the submissions. Keep that in mind when voting. (edit: funny I just said the opposite thing Todd said! :) )
