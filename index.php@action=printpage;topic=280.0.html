				In the vein of &quot;does anyone remember,&quot;<br /><br />On Roosevelt Avenue between 78th and 79th streets, the north side. One of the most magical toy stores in Jackson Heights TOY CITY. Board games, Hobby crafts, bicycles, handballs, street chalk...you name it they had it. Closed their&nbsp; doors if I&#039;m not mistaken in the early 80&#039;s.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been recently looking for any photographs anyone may have of the actual building or for that matter any photos of 37th avenue or Roosevelt of the 70&#039;s or early 80&#039;s....working on a little Jackson Heights memories project. If you can help do let me know!<br /><br />-G

				I remember Toy City on Roosevelt Ave. very well.&nbsp; My sister and I purchased a Ouija (sp?) Board game there on one occasion.&nbsp; It scared the heck out of us the first time we used it!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; Unfortunately I don&#039;t&nbsp; have any photos, just the fond memories.&nbsp; You can try posting a message on the following website.&nbsp; There are a lot of Jackson Heights&#039; old-timers carrying on discussions about the neighborhood and its yesteryear.&nbsp; Perhaps they can come up with a photo of the store for you.<br /><br />www.gothamcenter.org<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Toy City was one of my favorite haunts as well. Does anyone remember the store before they moved to the Roosevelt Ave location? It was a smaller store on 37th in the 70&#039;s.

				Sure that was Toy City?&nbsp; I remember a BAARS toys where Novo or Starbucks is now, next to a dress shop, on 37th, between 78th and 79th.<br /><br />Also, I checked at Mom&#039;s in old albums, no pictures of Toy City, sorry.<br /><br />But yeah I do have some at the comic store like I thought (Discount Books).

				I lived in Jackson Heights through most of the 1960s and I also remember Toy City being on 37th Avenue, and between 75th and 76th Street sounds about right.&nbsp; I also remember the Greenglass store on the west side of 74th Street, between 37th and Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; When I grew a bit older, one of my favorite hangouts, as it were, was Center Cycle on Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; In addition to bicycles, they had a great selection of chemistry set supplies.

				&quot;the place I am thinking of was on the south side of 37th, probably between 75 &amp; 76 streets. &quot;<br /><br />There was indeed a toy store there - right next to a Kosher deli. A lot of their stuff was just laid out on tables in the middle of the store. <br /><br />And yes - Baars?&nbsp; across from the Post Office was great for Matchbox and Corgi cars and some brand of British soldiers?&nbsp; <br /><br />There was also a toy/hobby shop on Roosevelt and 86th? - Gerstenhabers. They sold everything from sporting goods, to plastic models to cribs.<br /><br />There was also a hole-in-the wall hobby shop in the underground arcade -- offbeat European cars and soldiers.<br /><br />I&#039;m old enough to remember when there was a Woolworth&#039;s AND a Kresgie&#039;s on 82nd, basically across from each other.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				Gerstenhaber&#039;s was on the corner of 85th Street and Roosevelt. I remember so well. I loved to go through the aisles and look and even get things when my mom would buy them. <br /><br />Do you remember Sears on Roosevelt between 84th and 85th Street. Would cut throught the store every day on the way home from school (I went to P.S. 89). There was a back entrance on Forley street and then exist the Roosevelt Avenue (main) entrance. <br /><br />

				Just an aside ... it is crazy how far we used to bike at younga ges.&nbsp; I was maybe 9 or 10 and my friend I would ride to Flushing Meadows on a whim.&nbsp; Craziness.<br /><br />Also crazy to think that there was a time that you left for school and literally your parents didn&#039;t know if you made it or were alive or whatever til they got home from work at 5 or 6.&nbsp; The era known as B.C.P.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Before Cell Phones)<br /><br />
