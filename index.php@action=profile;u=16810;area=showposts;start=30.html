					I came from Brooklyn five years ago, but considered Astoria when I wanted to move to Queens to be closer to work. Daisy&#039;s review is pretty accurate in my opinion.&nbsp; My best friend lives in Astoria and she tried to get me to move there, but JH was cheaper, offered more space for the money and had more train options.&nbsp; It also has better street parking than most of the spots I&#039;ve seen in Astoria (there, many streets seem to have alternate side up to 4x/week, where JH only has 2x/week).&nbsp; The 7 train being out of service on weekends is a problem, but at least there are plenty of other options...as opposed to waiting forever for the N/Q which I&#039;ve had to do many nights on the way in from Manhattan. I still go to Astoria for the gym and BBQ at Butcher, and Martha&#039;s on occasion, but I like the new additions to JH and I&#039;m glad I&#039;m here. <br /><br />I need to move to a bigger apartment soon, and I looked into Astoria but (in my opinion) it is still overpriced for what it is, compared to JH. <br /><br />Good luck with your search!

					I&#039;ve been to Samudra a few times over the past couple weeks, and even ordered delivery from them. I ended up here because I was trying to order takeout from Arunee and they told me the wait time was 45 minutes (on a Wednesday night!).&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this is a really great addition to the area, and I can&#039;t believe that they&#039;re not getting more foot traffic.&nbsp; The food has been consistently good, the servers consistently friendly and helpful.&nbsp; I even got a free dessert to try the last time I was there. I hope they succeed!

					I haven&#039;t been there yet, but my husband went yesterday and said he likes this addition to the neighborhood. He thinks the prices for organic produce are pretty reasonable, and it&#039;s nice that we can walk there instead of having to drive to other places. He said that one of the workers were complaining about the door setup because cold air rushes in everytime the door opens. Maybe one of those plastic outer doors might help? Either way, welcome to the area, Natural Market!

					Thanks for the post That_girl. Someone broke into my apartment in JH a couple years ago via a fire escape window that was left open, so this is a real issue that people should be aware of.<br /><br />Toque198, the patterns that the article refers to aren&#039;t the types of burglaries, it&#039;s the areas where the burglaries are occuring. <br /><br />First pattern: 4 apartments near Woodside Avenue near 79th Street in Elmhurst<br />Second pattern: 3 homes on Van Cleef Street near 51st Avenue in Corona, and possibly another on 56th Ave.<br />Third pattern: 2 break-ins: 94th Street and 54th Avenue and 112th Street near 48th Avenue <br />Fourth pattern: 3 apartments in the same building on St. James Street near 86th Street<br /><br />All these break-ins were done the same way through fire escapes &amp; open windows.

					I agree with JIF. Places that have good food but poor decor/ambience are places that I would go to for takeout. I used to go to the old Arunee for takeout on the way home--- but I didn&#039;t really want to stay there. The new Arunee is closer to my apartment AND it looks great! Side note, I tried going there last week, but there were no tables.&nbsp; I placed a takeout order and it ended up taking 50 minutes! Kind of sad about that, and hoping that it&#039;s just new restaurant growing pains. I&#039;ll definitely be back again

					I love a good online sale as much as the next person...but I&#039;d also rather have a Gap Outlet or something similar than another pharmacy/99 cent store/pollo a la brasa &lt;insert name here&gt;.&nbsp; I think the only way to ensure that we get diverse retailers and businesses here is to support them when they show up.&nbsp; If Gap does well, who knows what else might be attracted to the area?

					I think it&#039;s good for the time being, and it doesn&#039;t mean that---if successful--- we won&#039;t ever have premium retail in JH.&nbsp; I think that with most things, the neighborhood will evolve over time.&nbsp; Pharmacies and 99 cent stores have been prevalent for so long that I certainly didn&#039;t think that the likes of even a Gap outlet would ever open here. And yet, one is on the way.&nbsp; It will probably take a while, but I think that if enough people shop at the newer places in the area, then that will attract other businesses. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure that LLs will be holding out for more tenants like the Gap. For years, lots of LLs we&#039;ve been talking about the empty, available spaces in JH and wondering what the LLs are holding out for/how they can afford to keep the properties vacant. I don&#039;t think they were all holding out for big(ger) retailers. <br /><br />

It was on Northern Boulevard, there was a child, he was mowed down, by a guy with a suspended license.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Based on the witness account in the article, it seems like the kid walked under the truck as it was turning, not that the truck was speeding or otherwise mowed him down. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to diminish the tragic loss of the child or his family&#039;s grief. Yes, the driver was unlicensed and should be punished for that, but this could have just as easily happened with a licensed driver. I know that I&#039;ve had some near misses on Northern where I&#039;ve had the light, I wasn&#039;t speeding or distracted, and kids have popped out from between parked cars. Driving on Northern or any streets near a school is scary around here.<br /><br />And yes, the BQE entrances and exits are especially problematic. I&#039;ve seen people cross against the light there. They&#039;re such short crossings, but for cars coming off the BQE, they can see that they have the light, but can&#039;t clearly see the intersection because of overgrown shurbs and the curve of the road. We should all be really careful driving and walking around.<br />

					For those who missed the Maspeth meeting on Airplane noise, here&#039;s some news coverage:<br /><br />AIRPLANE NOISE COMPLAINTS AIRED;A TOWN HALL MEETING IN MASPETH BRINGS GRIEVANCES ABOUT LAGUARDIA<br />Queens Chronicle<br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/airplane-noise-complaints-aired/article_026cf1a8-0b0f-522c-bf3b-dedde8d1b39f.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/eastern/airplane-noise-complaints-aired/article_026cf1a8-0b0f-522c-bf3b-dedde8d1b39f.html</a><br />by Laura Shepard<br /><br />All over Queens, residents say that increased plane noise is affecting their quality of life. However, the neighborhoods of Maspeth and Middle Village have not been known to have this problem because they are located south of LaGuardia Airport, away from departing routes.Representatives from the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration sought to address the community’s complaints at a Maspeth Town Hall public information meeting hosted by Assemblywoman Marge Markey (D-Maspeth) on Nov. 6.Nevertheless, longtime resident and civic leader, Roe Daraio says her windows shake and the planes fly so low “it’s as if they’re going to land on our roof.”<br /><br />Joyce Franceschina says that she can smell jet fuel on a regular basis.Mark Guiod, an air traffic manager for the FAA, said that the most frustrating thing about his job is that people keep asking him what has changed. “Nothing’s changed,” he said. “the only thing that ever changes is seasonal weather patterns.”“Weather doesn’t just happen on Saturday,” one resident replied, referring to the noise that woke up many people in the area shortly after 6 a.m. the previous weekend.Ed Knoesel from the Port Authority informed the community that one runway was closed for maintenance while the taxiway was repaved and that this will not be a pattern.Richard Doyle lives in Elmhurst and said the plane noise has never been loud enough to wake him up, prior to June. He believes that the noise has increased because the flight path for arriving planes has shifted about 10 to 15 blocks east. He claims that the planes used to fly over the western end of Maspeth, which is industrial and commercial, rather than the residential area, which is on a hill.<br /><br />Daraio and Franceschina’s houses sit on the Maspeth plateau, which is seven stories above sea level at its highest point, giving residents an unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline.<br />Daraio, who has lived in Maspeth for 38 years, said that she invited neighbors over to eat in her yard, in previous summers.“This summer, I couldn’t have anyone over. I never went through this ever before. I don’t know why you’re saying you didn’t change anything when I can’t hear my neighbors a few feet away,” she said.Guiod explained to the meeting NextGen, a highly sophisticated computer system that lets pilots follow a defined path, in order to optimize efficiency, while maintaining safety in the nation’s most complex airspace.<br /><br />Some residents described the frequency by which the planes arrive as one after another, every 20 seconds or so, but Guiod accused them of exaggerating because a plane cannot land until the previous plane has landed and turned off the runway, which takes about a minute and 45 seconds.“I would give the air traffic controller an award if he can move planes that fast,” he said.Middle Village resident Len Santoro said that since 2008 the planes have been flying lower over his home late at night, to the point where he can’t keep his window open. Santoro said that he once complained to the Port Authority and was told that planes do not fly below 3,000 feet over his home.“I find that very hard to believe,” he said.Former United pilot David Williams described a typical descent into LaGuardia Airport at the meeting. He said that planes approach the city over Prospect Park at 2,500 feet, cross the former Maspeth tanks at 1,500 feet, find the expressway and descend at a three-degree glide, which is preferable to flying low.<br /><br />A resident asked Guiod if the noise in Middle Village and Maspeth is a result of the departure procedure, which has planes take off south and turn east to fly over northeast Queens, but he said that’s not the case.Knoesel, told the community that all four noise monitors around LaGuardia Airport will be replaced with new ones, which will monitor real-time noise, to ensure that arriving and departing planes do not exceed the limit of 112 perceived noise level in decibels.He noted that this has been the limit since the 1960s and that airlines that exceed this level at JFK Airport are hit with a $250 fine, but there is no penalty at LaGuardia. Neither the PA nor the airports can change this discrepancy because the fines are enshrined in federal law, he noted.Knoesel said the agency will now calculate noise contours, or the average noise in an area, annually rather than every five years.<br /><br />The agency is updating its website to display flight noise, decibel levels, runway closures and flight tracking in real time. Knoesel said they aim to have the new website up by December.<br />The complaint system has also been integrated and now consists of a toll free number, (800) 225-1071 and a form is available online at planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9.<br />Markey said that she will ask Borough President-Elect Melinda Katz to use the Aviation Advisory Committee to serve the community.Meanwhile, Carmine Gallo, the FAA regional administrator, is forming a roundtable, which will include community representatives, but Guiod does not know when this will happen.<br /><br /><br />_________<br />BETTER AIRPLANE NOISE MONITORING SYSTEM TO COME TO BORO: OFFICIALS<br />Times Ledger<br /><a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/46/maspethplanes_tl_2013_11_15_q.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/46/maspethplanes_tl_2013_11_15_q.html</a><br />By Bianca Fortis<br /><br />Queens is getting a new system for monitoring noise from area airports, officials from the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey said last week.State Assemblywoman Marge Markey (D-Maspeth) called a meeting Nov. 6 at Maspeth Town Hall for officials from the Port Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration to address longstanding complaints about noise from airplanes flying into and out of LaGuardia and Kennedy International airports.Residents came from Woodside, Middle Village, Maspeth, Elmhurst, Woodside and Jackson Heights for the meeting.Edward Knoesel, manager of the Port Authority’s environmental services aviation department, announced a new Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System is in the process of being implemented throughout the borough.<br /><br />Knoesel said the new system will provide more accurate and current information and the data logs will be available within 24 hours. The old system has a four-day lag time.At the end of the year, a public website will be launched that will track flights, monitor noise decibel readings, provide runway closure announcements and allow city residents to file noise complaints, Knoesel said.The Port Authority will keep 10 years of data that have been obtained through the old system.Members of the community say airplane noise pollution has been louder, lower and more frequent than in the past, especially over the summer.Roe Daraio, president of Communities of Maspeth &amp; Elmhurst Together, a civic group, said at times the planes are so loud they sound like they are about to land on the roofs of homes. She has experienced her house vibrating, she said.“Our windows shake,” she said. “By 1 o’clock, I’m taking aspirin — and that’s when I’m in the house with my windows closed.”Some residents said that they have been awakened late at night because of aircraft noise.Knoesel said there are no restrictions to what time a plane can fly, although airlines generally operate the planes between the hours of 6 a.m. and 12 a.m.Over the summer some airlines choose to land later flights if the flights have been delayed, according to Mark Guiod, manager of the FAA’s New York Terminal Radar Approach Control. Some land as late as 2 a.m.<br /><br />Knoesel said residents all around Queens suffer from the noise. Authorities must balance complaints along with maintaining operations of the airports that are part of the busiest airspace in the world, he said.He said La Guardia airlines are beginning to replace some older, louder planes, which should help address the noise issue.“The geographical area of who is being exposed to and experiencing that noise is shrinking, it’s getting smaller,” he said. “The planes are changing out, and these planes are a lot quieter than what they used to be. There’s no more 707s, there’s no more 727s — those things were really very, very loud.”To log complaints, call 1-800-225-1071. Complaints can also be submitted through planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbf9.Information about Queens Quiet Skies, a nonprofit that advocates for relief from airplane noise for all Queens residents, is available at queensquietskies.org. The group can be contacted at <a href="mailto:queensquietskies@aol.com" class="bbc_email">queensquietskies@aol.com</a>.<br />

					I completely support this, and I think some drivers are nuts.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that kids are literally being killed in the streets.&nbsp; That said, I think EVERYONE needs some training in the rules of the road. As a cyclist, pedestrian and driver, I&#039;ve seen the ridiculous behavior of all three.&nbsp; Just walking down the sidewalk, I&#039;m constantly barraged by people who refuse to look up from their phones. It&#039;s amazing that with all these driving infractions, people aren&#039;t more attentive to their surroundings. Everyone, please be careful out there.

					JIF, I wondered the same thing! I didn&#039;t hear it at all yesterday, and I was actually able to sleep until 7:30 this morning, instead of the usual 6am roaring wakeup.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to jinx it, but it&#039;s nice to have *just* the sirens and car alarms again :-).

					Thanks for sending the link, lifeofpi.&nbsp; I am usually okay with the rare noise, but today was the 3rd day in a row of 6:15am wakeup because of airplane noise.&nbsp; The past 2 days, the planes could be heard until at least 11pm.&nbsp; I hope this is it for the month.
