				Hello!<br /><br />In anticipation of her upcoming book, coming out in 2012, Christi Shannon Kline will be giving a preview reading at JHPFs FIRST TUESDAYS on Tuesday, November 1, 2011 at Terraza Cafe.<br /><br />Sign-up for the reading will start at around 6:45pm, and readings begin at 7:15-7:30pm. We also have a great musical follow-up act.<br /><br />The reading will be held at Terraza Cafe - on Gleane street and Roosevelt avenue, off the 82nd street stop on the 7 Train! You can find directions here.<br /><br />Please find information about Christi Shannon Kline below, and a flyer attached.<br />&nbsp;<br />Arkansas native, Christi Shannon Kline is a New York-based American poet, playwright, and performer and member of Actors&#039; Equity Association and The Dramatist Guild. She has had the good fortune to study extensively, by invitation, with renowned poet and translator, Marie Ponsot.<br /><br />Christi&#039;s poetry first premiered as part of a political ballet, SLIPPERY PEOPLE, which she was commissioned to write for a dance company in residence at the prestigious Jacob&#039;s Pillow Dance Festival. Her play, REUNION, a full length drama in the Southern Gothic style about an adopted woman who searches for her identity, was presented at the National Conference on Adoption in Manhattan in 2010, and subsequently at The Drilling Company Theater, with Christi playing the leading role.<br /><br />Her upcoming book, No Child More Perfect is currently being published by Nirala and scheduled for release in early 2012 and advance notice is good: Author and JHPF board member, Richard Jeffrey Newman says: These are poems of real courage, and so they are also poems of hope. It is a wonderful thing that Christi has brought them into the world. And Marie Ponsot, winner of The National Book Critics Circle Award, says Watch out! Christi Shannon Kline&#039;s poems are original. She speaks her mind: ordinary and desperate, frank and unfaked and full of feeling. The poems sing, and we welcome their freshness.<br /><br />See you soon!<br /><br />JHPF
