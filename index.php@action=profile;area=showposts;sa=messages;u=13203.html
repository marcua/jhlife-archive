					Good People of JH,<br /><br />I love all the beautiful holiday gestures I&#039;ve been reading. In these really peculiar, stressful, nerve-wracking, and sad times, it is a community like this that brings some light to the awful dark among us.<br /><br />On Saturday 12.29.12, Community Art &amp; Storytime will be hosting an arts &amp; science workshop to raise funds for the Lululeo fund, in memory of Lucia and Leo Krim. <br /><br />I am inviting children and their parents/caregivers to come along and join me in what I call: &quot;Recycle-a-Robot!&quot; <br /><br />Lucia and Leo loved art and science programs that they used to attend in the City, so Recycle-a-Robot, welds the two together in hopes of celebrating them, and the innocence and sweetness of childhood. You can read more about the fund here <a href="http://lululeofund.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://lululeofund.org/</a><br /><br />Saturday December 29, 2012<br />10am-12pm <br />Workshop Ages 1-12<br />Fee: $10 as always<br />Garden School 33-16 79th street<br /><br />Please contact Prof. Bernard at <a href="mailto:profbernard.nyc@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">profbernard.nyc@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:communityworkshopsnyc@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">communityworkshopsnyc@gmail.com</a> to sign up. I urge and encourage everyone who is planning to attend, to email me to reserve a spot, so I can be sure there are adequate supplies!<br /><br />To make the workshop even more fun, please consider bringing any of the following, for the robot stations:<br /><br />Nuts &amp; Bolts - other robot-y hardware parts (not too small, as small children will be participating as well)<br />Empty/Washed Juice Boxes<br />Cardboard boxes (big or small)<br />Foil Wrap<br />Empty Plastic Bottles <br />Bottle Caps<br />Buttons<br />A roll of paper towels<br />Paper towel rolls (w/o the paper)<br />etc.,<br /><br />Please contact me if you have any questions, would like to donate funds or supplies but can&#039;t attend, or if you have any questions!<br /><br />Hope to see many of you on the 29th!<br /><br />-Best wishes,<br />Dr. Bernard<br /><br />

					Sorry for the multiple posts...I also wanted to add that the discussions on the blog of our site are not all reflective of the organization but rather the classes that I teach (such as bls 1019) and the perspectives of the students, the readings they are assigned, and the discussions they have in class. Although some controversial, perhaps classrooms are the safest place to have &quot;those&quot; conversations about the type of readings they are engaged in. - bookclubproject.

					Hi Everyone at JHL! I&#039;m so glad I found this site. I am the founder of a community org that&#039;s just budding... <a href="http://www.bookclubproject.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.bookclubproject.com</a>, and we are currently looking to revamp our program, particularly since the summer isn&#039;t as far as we think (the weather could be tricking us into thinking it is). I am also a f/t professor (with a PhD in Urban Education) that spends a great deal of time teaching courses in Urban Ed and other social science areas. (I hope that was a good intro). <br /><br />My organization is currently looking to offer a toddler story-time set of workshops for Jackson Heights families. Before we give an extensive description of the program, and fees (these are just to keep the program afloat and include supplies) and all the goodies that come along with it, I wondered if you all here have any clever suggestions as to <span class="bbc_u">where </span>we can hold our program!? Since we are just in our budding stage, space has been an immense issue. We&#039;ve been running teen book clubs at various schools, but in this expansion, we really need a place that families feel welcome, warm, and comfortable, and dont require that families belong to a particular school, etc.,<br /><br />I have thought about cafes, but toddlers want to sit on the floor, on a rug, and really get into it. Chairs in a cafe just seems to block their flow a bit. <br /><br />If anyone has any thoughts that you can share that would be AMAZING and so appreciated. We really want to make sure we can offer our storytime at least by Spring into the summer.<br /><br />In the meantime, our FREE book club is always looking for new adult members! So join... <a href="http://www.bookclubproject.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.bookclubproject.com</a> - this month we&#039;re reading Mildred Pierce, and the kick off discussion is on Tuesday.<br /><br />Take Care, and thanks in advance for any help!<br /><br />bookclubproject
