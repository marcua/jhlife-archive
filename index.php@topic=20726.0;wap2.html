			<strong>Seth</strong>:
			<br />
			This is Program B in a series of three programs of sevenlocalfilm.com docs of mine, mainly about Queens and immigration. The content and form of each program is distinct, but they each were shot in Jackson Heights-Elmhurst where they will screen at Terraza 7, inaugurating its new outdoor screening room. <br /><br />BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS (2018, 81 mins) works between original and archival footage in split screen to contemplate the present and past of immigration and imperialism that orbit the Unisphere since the last NY World&#039;s Fair.&nbsp; It audiovisualizes the confrontation of two forms of globalization, one social and the other corporate, that are at odds in Queens between the age of Robert Moses, who built the giant stainless-steel armillary and that of AOC, whose district surrounds it.&nbsp; You can read more about the film and the entire evening&#039;s program, as well as the other events in this series here:<br />https://terraza7.com/event/between-neighborhoods-film-screening-filmmaker-seth-fein-qa/<br /><br />The entire series, 23, 24, 30 October @ 6:30 pm @Terraza 7, is free and open to all, thanks to a City Arts Corps Grant from the NY Foundation for the Arts, NYC Dept of Cultural Affairs, the Mayor&#039;s Office for Media and Entertainment, and the Queens Theatre.
