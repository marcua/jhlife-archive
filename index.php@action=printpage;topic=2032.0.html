				Hi everybody,<br /><br />My wife and I just moved and find ourselves with a coffee table and bench that don&#039;t fit in the new place.<br /><br />Both items were purchased from Ikea for about $150 each.&nbsp; We are asking for $25 each, or $40 for both.&nbsp; We&#039;ll also throw in the cushions if you buy the bench.&nbsp; Other offers will also be considered!<br /><br />The table has a few dings, scratches, and marks...the bench is like-new.&nbsp; Both have a fairly substantial real-wood veneer, so they are a little better (and heavier!) than the average particle board furniture.<br /><br />We are located on 73rd St b/w 34th ave. and Broadway in the Birchwood House.&nbsp; Please e-mail me if you are interested!

				Hey,<br /><br />Birchwood House is pretty good so far, although there were some minor annoyances with the renovations that I am still in the process of fixing myself.&nbsp; And I wish the scaffolding was gone and the roof deck was open!<br /><br />You know, something like 60 apartments changed hands in this building in the last year (and mostly in the past few months).&nbsp; That&#039;s at least 100 new residents...we should start our own little online forum for the building or something.&nbsp; There might be a narrow window to build a more cohesive community.&nbsp; I sent you a PM as well.

				Hi Jason,<br />Yea I wish the roofdeck is ready too. The workers told me that it&#039;s too cold to work on the roofdeck now. I hope we have it ready by the summer. I just send you a PM as well too.<br /><br />-Sarah
