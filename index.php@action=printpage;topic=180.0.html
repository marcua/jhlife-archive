				I saw a new bakery sign at the old Jay Dee bakery, next to&nbsp; Waldbaums at 77st/31 ave.<br />It&#039;s called &quot;Cannelle&quot; and I can&#039;t wait for it to open. I sure hope it&#039;s good.<br />

				Has anyone heard there will be a french patisserie opening in the shopping center north of Northern Boulevard this Friday, run by the former pastry chef of the Waldorf Astoria?<br /><br />The center is between 30 and 31st Aves, 75th and 77th Streets.<br /><br />[I have merged this with an earlier thread on this topic.&nbsp; &nbsp;--Moderator]

				Hey, I just googled it, and came up with this:<br /><br />http://cannellepatisserie.com/<br /><br />The website states that the bakers have catered to presidents and dignitaries.<br /><br />Can it be coincidence that one of the contact e-mails at the site lists someone by the name of Samba?&nbsp; On a recent post by Toddg on immigrant business owners, the site link profiles a French baker located in Harlem also named Samba.&nbsp; I wonder if it&#039;s the same person?

				O.K., so upon further reading the information at the bakery&#039;s website, it seems that it&#039;s not the same person, just the same name (Samba).&nbsp; All three persons associated with this bakery have had experience working at the Waldorf, the head being the former pastry chef at the <br />Waldorf for 10 years.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a page containing information on Executive Pastry Chef Jean-Claude Perennou.<br /><br />http://waldorf.web01.i-sites.com/waldorf_cookbook/about/

				Wow, that looks amazing.<br /><br />We sure do have an abundance of great new dessert bakeries -- Lety&#039;s, Mango&#039;s, Ambrosia (Espresso 77), and now Cannelle -- but for some reason, still no place that bakes its own bread!

				There are tables and chairs, and a really nice atmosphere.&nbsp; Nice wood/granite/glass interior.&nbsp; It&#039;s spacious enough to sit down comfortably, although I did take out today.&nbsp; I talked to the woman there and she said that they&#039;re not sure of their hours yet, but they would try to open at 6:30 am and close at 9 or even 10 pm.&nbsp; She said they would also be able to take orders (for cakes or even ham/cheese croissants, etc) for pick-up as well.&nbsp; This is such a classy place, and I&#039;m extremely happy about it.&nbsp; The food was outstanding.<br />

				Stopped by Cannelle earlier today with some friends.&nbsp; The regular croissants and ham and cheese croissants were fresh out of the oven and were absolutely delicious!&nbsp; The texture was light and flakey, and what can I say about that fresh buttery flavor?&nbsp; &nbsp;:smitten:&nbsp; We&#039;ve been here a few times already, and have yet to be disappointed with any of the pastry offerings that we&#039;ve tried so far.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the coffee is a bit on the weak side, but the Harney &amp; Sons tea they offer does well in the pinch.&nbsp; The place was jamming with customers both seated and those doing take out.&nbsp; At first I thought this place was too far for us to frequent, but I&#039;m strongly reconsidering that.

				This place is really nice, good&nbsp; baguette and the macaroons were delicious, just one not so minor complaint: the coffee was pretty weak.&nbsp; Now that we are living in a post-starbucks era, I have come to expect (perhaps unreasonably) decent coffee wherever I go - especially in a bakery as high quality as this one.

				Lex, perhaps if a good amount of Cannelle&#039;s customers mention the coffee issue to the shop&#039;s management, they may be willing to listen and make a change for improvement.&nbsp; After all, what a pairing that would be...great coffee along with a scrumptious pastry!&nbsp;

				The salmon quiche was unbelievable this morning. I have a feeling they may try to improve on the coffee, which is a bit on the weak side. It would be great if they opened a smaller store more near 37th ave.

				I was there yet again this morning thinking that a weekday morning would find the place not as crowded as it seems on the weekends.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; There was a very different vibe going on today at Cannelle.&nbsp; Many moms and dads with strollers were enjoy their coffees and pastries.&nbsp; There was even someone using a laptop.&nbsp; I know they don&#039;t offer WiFi, so I suppose this person was not utilizing the internet.

				I&#039;m not sure where in JH you live, but even though Canelle&#039;s pastries are tastier and cheaper than others, I&#039;m less apt to walk that far to get them, so convenience outweighs significantly. Any retailer located beyond Northern Boulevard is terribly placed for everyday &quot;historic district&quot; JH consumers in my opinion and it really irks me that Canelle couldn&#039;t find a place more convenient near 37th Avenue; they would have done major things for the vibrancy of the area (and since rents are probably higher on 37th, you&#039;d be paying the same for the pastry!) perhaps inspiring the opening of a French Bistro even?

				I look at it this way: part of living in an interesting area is having something to walk to in every direction. Now there&#039;s a compelling reason to walk north of Northern Blvd.&nbsp; All of the other directions have long been fun on their own.

				My husband and I were there again this weekend in the a.m. (gee, we might as well move in) and took the opportunity to chat with Burak, the manager, regarding the issue of the weak coffee.&nbsp; Although he didn&#039;t mention what beans they are using, he did explain that the beans are widely recognized as high quality in the high-end restaurant industry.&nbsp; He also went on to say that preparation is an important issue in terms of doing justice to the beans.&nbsp; That seems to be something that they&#039;re still working on.&nbsp; He said, &quot;give us a few weeks&quot; on the coffee.&nbsp; It will improve.&quot;&nbsp; Burak was very open to our suggestions, and he, along with Mr. Perennou, are very interested in customer feedback.

				Bonsoir ! Hello and Good Evening :<br />I just want to say thank you for all your comments about Cannelle because it gives us direct and honest feedback.<br />I&#039;m the PR Rep and I always go on line to see what customers have to say . The Chefs and the rest of the management team are always interested in what you have to say, both negative and positive. Our mission statement is all about quality and customer service, so believe it or not we do lose some sleep if something is not up to par. Albeit, you can&#039;t satisfy everyone all the time, but there is nothing wrong in trying to make a few people happy most of the time. I, personally, am an incurable romantic, therefore, when the chef takes weeks to decide on the appropriate decor, as well as perfecting an already impeccable dessert, it is with the greatest respect and anticipation that I await the results of this reflection.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />As a resident of this neighborhood , I feel obliged to express my thoughts ,although it only leaves me vulnerable to all types of criticism. However, I couldn&#039;t sit back and not acknowledge the pleura of customers that have openly expressed their thoughts and opinions and I want them to know it was not in vain.<br />You guys are awesome!! Superb!!&nbsp; Please feel free(as you already do), to express comments and complaints about Canelle .I will surely communicate all findings to the rest of the staff.<br />FYI.. Management is keen on the SuperBowl, so to all the fans out there...stop by and lets know&nbsp; wish team you are rooting for!!!<br />Once again Thanks for giving us such a Great welcome. :)

				I went to Canelle recently to check it out and I was impressed with the space and presentation of the baked goods, but the croissant i had was somewhat disappointing.

				I am so glad Jay Dee is no longer. As a matter of fact, (and I have no idea why right now), but I ordered my wedding cake from Jay Dee, and it was the absolute worst part of my wedding. I am SO HAPPY w/the new Cannelle. I do agree, the coffee is not that great, but the croissants/danishes are superb. We&#039;ve already ordered a cake and we were pretty pleased with it, although I do wish they had more selections and more&nbsp; b&#039;day cake options. At first I thought this store was too &quot;upscale&quot; for this area, but I am wrong. There are so many people that go in, and I think it&#039;s doing very well. It is in the perfect neighborhood.

				We stopped by Cannelle earlier today and as usual, the place was jumping.&nbsp; We even had to wait for a short while for a table to become available.&nbsp; Everything was great, and then I noticed that they&#039;re selling those rainbow cookies that I love.&nbsp; As I moved closer to the display case, I realized that these small cookies are being sold at 2 for $1.00!&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; I&#039;ve always thought that Cannelle has been reasonable on their pricing, but the price on these cookies is pretty outrageous.&nbsp; Aren&#039;t these types of cookies usually sold by the pound rather than individually?&nbsp; Of course, I had to buy 2 in an effort to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, these cookies are so incredibly delicious that they merit the 2 for $1.00 price.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />Downright incredibly delicious!&nbsp; :smitten:&nbsp; You savor the dark chocolate ganache, moist cake and the sweetness of the raspberry.<br /><br />Are they worth the asking price?&nbsp; The jury is still out on this one.&nbsp; They&#039;re just much too small and thin leaving me yearning for more.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s the greater plan.

				My GF and i made our first trip here last Saturday and we were not disappointed.&nbsp; It was crowded and we had to sit at two barstools in the front near the window.&nbsp; &nbsp; The place is very attractive and clean inside.&nbsp; We each got the same order, a plain bagel with cream cheese.&nbsp; So fresh and delicious.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t someone make low carb bagels and low fat cream cheese that taste like this so I don&#039;t have to eat oat cereal almost everyday?

				Eddie, Dunkin Donuts makes low bagels, but I don&#039;t know how good they are. They also have low fat cream cheese.&nbsp; That said, if I&#039;m heading into Dunking it&#039;s probably not for a low fat item.&nbsp; I&#039;m weak that way. :embarassed:<br /><br />I noticed that Cannelle is now selling fruit salad.&nbsp; They seem to be making an effort to offer more than just pastries, by selling sandwiches and quiche too.

				I love Cannelle Patisserie, everything there is delicious, their chocolate chip cookies make me wish I could live on a diet of chocolate chip cookies only.&nbsp; The apple strips are so apple-y and buttery and they have mini muffins and mini croissants-so cute!&nbsp; I want to try everything at CP.

				I had the opportunity to do a side by side comparison of the croissants from our local Cannelle and the highly touted Almondine in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I found Cannelle&#039;s croissants to be lighter and flakier in texture, whereby Almondine&#039;s were much more dense and sweeter.&nbsp; I&#039;m no expert (although I wish I were&nbsp; :angel:), but I much prefer Cannelle&#039;s on both taste and texture...hands down!

				~Cannelle Patisserie~<br />waht can i say, im extremely speachless.... every1 already said all they had to say about about the bread and cakes and danishes....<br />i just love how they transformed JAY DEE&nbsp; into waht it is now<br />i can focus more on the food then then look at the floor to see if im going to fall over a crack.<br /><br />me and my friends used to come to the store all the time whe it 1st opened&nbsp; we were highly addicted to just about everything at the store.<br />i havent been there in quite a while, and when i came back i was delighted to see that they have new selections to their ever growing list of paistries.&nbsp; they have such a big list that they need to get new larger refrigerated showcase. i&#039;v noticed sometimes they place certain deserts behind otehr deserts on the lower shelves.&nbsp; seems like ther are really cranking out stuff in the back.<br /><br />&nbsp;have to say&nbsp; the faces at the store&nbsp; changes from time to time...&nbsp; new people behind the counter&nbsp; every few months or so.&nbsp; i dont know what others have to say about this&nbsp; but i find this a good thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Cannelle patiseries&nbsp; has been good with the food from the start, hands down.<br />the store did get upgraded in term of seating and comfort.&nbsp; a booth instead of chairs, nicer larger pictures and pictures of items they actually sell, the light setting has also changed slightly dimer energy saving lights gives a nice touch to make it feel relaxed, and i&#039;v also observed that seasonal items placed on the window bar changes with special events and time of year. props to whom ever is incharge of the decore.<br /><br />when the store 1st opened it was chaotic and quite hectic,&nbsp; cant be blaimed&nbsp; due to the holliday season.<br />the service was not as greate as everything else on the store at the time. lines were getting longer faster then the people behind the customer can keep up.<br />despite waht everyone else thing i blaim the lackness in speed to the manager&nbsp; who used to be at the register.&nbsp; i&#039;v noticed he got his workers to complete an order for him while they were busy with another customer. he seem to arrange the type of systematic function they have in dunkin donuts. where each person is assigned to a certain duty and that duity only. when he is not there&nbsp; each person behin takes their own customer and fulfills their needs acordingly. tah sory of working system does not seem to work well with cannelle. it seem to work much smoother then what the front manager seemed to have in mind.&nbsp; i no longer see him there and it seems like a good change.<br /><br />i have gotten familiar with each face behind the counter, and i have to say&nbsp; cannelle management is doing an exceptional job to an EXTENT hiring people.&nbsp; as we all know each individual is different. but when working with customers patients, positive attitude, and being well informed is a major key in business.<br /><br />it&#039;s been almost 1 year since the opening&nbsp; and i have seen dozens of faces. some i was quite pleased to see gone, and others were delightfull.<br />whenever i go to canelle i look for 4 of my favorite employees.&nbsp; from least favorite to most favored<br />1st is a south-asian (guessing bangali) lady who usually wors in the morning, she is an agressive worker but my god&nbsp; she definately knows waht she is doing.<br />2nd&nbsp; is a hatian girl (katia)&nbsp; she has a nice smile and delightfully takes a customers order with propercare and service. im proud to say she serves me at cannelle<br />3rd is KAt&nbsp; (not sure of her background) spontanius and had a kiddy like charm. works well in a team and individually. knows her stuff to all she is doing. unfortunately she has moved back into the kitchen where she helps the chefs prepair the delicious cakes.<br />4th&nbsp; and lastly (my personal favorite cannelle employee) vinoth, also goes by nemo. WHAT A GUY.... he as impressed me and other customers on numerous occations. HE is by far the perfect example of a cannelle employee. He knows how to deal with troublesome customers, helps out his coworkers, and watches over the new and unexperienced workers, and knows the discription of all items they serve. i once asked him how bitter or swet the lomon square is, he replied &quot;tast of the lemon square is like, being able to look at the sun withought having to squint at it&#039;s magnificance&quot;.&nbsp; hearing those words i baught a few with no further questions. another time i asked about the fig hazel nut bread, he replied &quot;u know how u have a smile when u put something delight full in ur mouth, the 1st time i had the fig hazelnut bread,&nbsp; my smile had it&#039;s own smile&quot; and to my surprise when i tasted it myself&nbsp; he knows what heis talking about.&nbsp; (personally i find him charming in the way he talk and how he looks). i had&nbsp; the opportunity to talk to him outside cannell oneday,&nbsp; can anyone believe taht he is actually 19, he looks and speaks at a much more mature and sophiscated level. i could have thought he was atleast 25.<br /><br />moving on......<br /><br />cannelle&nbsp; i dont know what i would do without u............. im expecting to see more chains pop up in many other places

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Cannelle&#039;s has such high quality and sells lots of individual sized items that I would not be too concerned with Covid issues there. Before the pandemic they were always busy. Tremendous business all the time. Now it takes less time to buy something with shorter lines, though customers are buying a lot. Every other factor- quality, good prices and service are still intact. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The pies are extraordinary along with many other items and the rustic baguette is fantastic!

Do you believe this is why Farine closed? Why would Farine be impacted by this and not other bakeries in the neighborhood? <br /><br />Since Cannelle has been in business longer, they have had more time to develop a loyal customer base, which I&#039;m sure helps. They also were quick to put safety measures in place after they reopened. Cannelle had long lines outdoors, limiting capacity indoors when grocery stores were doing the same. Farine did not appear to make much of an effort to reopen. Perhaps it wasn&#039;t feasible financially for them?

				Farine was also a full-service restaurant, offering meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. While the chef had sandwiches on the menu, he also offered some pretty high-end stuff. I think the business model was predicated on continuing down that path, since a full kitchen and large dining space aren&#039;t exactly &quot;bakery&quot; things.
