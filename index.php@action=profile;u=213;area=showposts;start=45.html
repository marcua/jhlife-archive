					Shelby, I think in this case, cultural difference is a part of problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;What Brian is saying is let&#039;s face it and try to solve it rather than disregarding it as complaint from racists.&nbsp; <br /><br />I had to disagree with Todd&#039;s approach of &quot;having someone else keeping the street clean&quot;. &nbsp;It is not a fundamental solution to the problem on 74th street.<br />So what can we do? &nbsp;One of the solution can be to raise the awareness for store owners and shopper there. &nbsp;But how?? &nbsp;Teaching kids in school is one thing we can do.&nbsp; But it is gonna take too long time to see the effect. &nbsp;Any idea? &nbsp;maybe launch some kind of campaign with the help of community board or JHBG?? &nbsp; Or have marchants form BID?<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

					GregNYC, thanks for the info.&nbsp; but the point I was trying to make was that Helen Sears told me that there are many things you have to go through to install the trash can on the street and besically she said it is not easy.&nbsp; Basically, she was telling a lie so that she doesn&#039;t have to&nbsp; do her job.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone is able to get an answer from Helen Sears about the zone study?<br /><br /><br />

					I can talk about my own experience with Ms. Helen Sears.&nbsp; I attended one of the meetings for Western Jackson Heights Alliance and she was there.&nbsp; I had a chance to talk to her after the meeting was over.&nbsp; At that time, I was concerned about the filthiness on the 73rd street between 37th ave and 37th road.&nbsp; There are a couple of 24 hours open stores there and people hang around there and they often just throw garbage on the street.&nbsp; So, I asked her if she can put trash can in the spot where people hang out.&nbsp; She told me something like &quot;I likes the idea but to do this, you have to do blah, blah, blah...&quot;&nbsp; and basically she was saying it is not easy to do and she is not sure if she can do it.&nbsp; So, after that I decided to call the Sanitation department directly and ask to put a trash can.&nbsp; Guess what happens..&nbsp; About two weeks later, two trash cans were installed. <br /><br />So, what was all things Ms. Sears said to me then??&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t it supposed to be difficult even with the power of district council??&nbsp; I really believe that if she works harder for our community, the filthiness issue on 73rd and 74 street between 37th Ave and 37th Road could have been much improved.<br /><br /><br />From what I have seen at community meetings I have attended, many long time residents of JH expressed their frustration about her doing nothing for residents. So, it is not just a few people.&nbsp; I really think people in JH should consider recall her or take immediate action against her before our environment got worse I understand.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it is a good idea to wait until 2009 because she is going to bring more traffic congestion to our neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
