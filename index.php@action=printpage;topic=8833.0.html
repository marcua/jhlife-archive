				I would like to recommend our contractors Joe and Declan of SNJ Construction.<br /><br />My husband I recently purchased a co-op in Jackson Height&#039;s historic district.&nbsp; We hired Joe and Declan to smooth out the walls and trim, paint, and refinish the floors. They have done a fantastic job. The place looks even better than we expected. <br /><br />Joe and Declan were always professional and very easy to work with.&nbsp; They are fully licensed and insured. There were no problems with the co-op.<br /><br />I look forward to working with them again in the future when we renovate our kitchen and bathrooms.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a contractor in the neighborhood. <br /><br />They can be reached at: snjdromoneconstruction@yahoo.com

				I used Oldcastle when I renovated my last apartment. Gerard was great. I called him again this time but he was not be available for a few weeks, and I wanted to get into my new place quickly. <br /><br />Both are great companies, run by very reliable contractors.&nbsp;
