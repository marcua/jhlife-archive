				I&#039;ve seen a few apartments in JH that had the tub and shower separated. What I am wondering is: has anyone renovated a bathroom in Hawthorne Ct or Elm Ct or Greystones (I think layout is same or similar?) and separated the tub and shower? The bathroom is long and narrow and the shower would have to be 32X28, because any deeper and it would hit the doorway. The tub would have to be a short one at the end of the room under the window. Nice to have them separated, because a shower stall is just an easier way to take a shower than climbing in and out of a tub.

				It would be challenging to do that in Hawthorne Court, particularly if you&#039;re talking about moving the bathtub under the window, because that would require massive changes to the plumbing (e.g., moving the toilet, adding new piping for the bathtub etc.). I considered it when I moved in but it was too complicated, and decided to leave it as is. I do like a big bathtub and my second bathroom has a shower stall.

				Thank you Carrefour_NY--I do know it is possible to move the tub and/or shower under the window in Hawthorne Court, because I did a Streeteasy search of all HC houses, and I see at least 6 or 7 apartments where the photos show this. Whether doing it costs a huge amount of money is another issue--I have no idea, but I&#039;m going to look into it. Also, I understand that the width of the existing tub is narrower than most tubs are now, so it&#039;s hard to find a tub that will even fit where the old one was. It must be possible though, because I&#039;ve seen some HC bathrooms with a new tub in place of the old. So far I found exactly one Kohler model that appears to be narrow enough.

				A few months ago, I was looking at a one bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights online and was quite surprised at the picture of the bathroom.&nbsp; The owner had removed the bath tub and replaced it with a stall shower.&nbsp; The stall shower was the length of the bath tub.&nbsp; It looked awesome.&nbsp; I have a one bedroom with a separate shower stall and have never once used the bath tub in 14 years that I&#039;ve lived here.&nbsp; I understand some owners here keep plants in the bath tub.&nbsp;

				I found a 54-inch tub at Home Depot, lay down in it--and decided that moving the tub to under the window, where I could only fit a 54-inch tub was a terrible idea--very cramped even for a small person like me. The many people who have done this must never take baths, or only use bathtubs for small children. <br /><br />So now--does anyone have a recommendation for a comfortable, standard-size bathtub--60 X 30 inches? I want one with a sloping back and one that&#039;s deep enough for a good soak. My present, ancient tub is about 17 inches high, so that&#039;s what I&#039;m used to. There are zillions of tubs out there--anyone have a recommendation?
