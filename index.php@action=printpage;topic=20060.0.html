Here, at the end of the day, we are the ones suffering,&quot;said Chen. <br />Earlier in the week, the mayor promised the city would do “whatever it takes” to break up such encampments, but Elmhurst business owners said they have seen none of that enforcement.<br />“We cannot do anything. We call and nobody can help us. We want to survive. Right now, not too much business. That is why we need the help,&quot; said Yokehong Ooi, the manager at Pulau Pinang, a local restaurant.<br />One employee said a local nonprofit has been coming three times a day and providing water and food for the unsheltered individuals, and even dropped off tents to provide shade and covering during rain.<br />“There are toilets in the back. They don’t want to leave. There is more and more coming,” added Phuiman Lo, a waitress at Pulau Pinang.<br />They say they&#039;ve been fined because of the unintended consequences of the encampment.<br />“We have gotten tickets because it is too dirty. But it is not our fault. We have garbagemen come everyday, but it is them who throw the garbage to us in the back and we get tickets for them,&quot; said Lo.<br />The Department of Homeless Services said when a condition on the street needs to be addressed their office acts as quickly as they can.<br />The department stressed that it engages and works to build trust with the unsheltered individuals and offers them services, but added that results take time and do not happen overnight.

				I don’t know if this has been mentioned on this board yet, but I saw it posted in another forum and thought it might be helpful to post it here.<br /><br />There’s a bill before the City Council, Intro 1927, that&#039;s intended to reduce the spread of COVID among homeless New Yorkers and frontline social service and security workers. Rather than leave people in dangerous congregate shelters or move people into shared hotel spaces - typically occupied by strangers and which do not allow for protection from transmission - the bill requires the Department of Social Services to offer an individual room and bathroom to those in crowded, congregate shelters. Many people are not in shelters currently because they&#039;re afraid of contracting COVID in overcrowded shelters The bill also strengthens support for those living unsheltered on our streets and subways. <br /><br />Neither Danny Dromm or Francisco Moya has co-sponsored the legislation or indicated that they support it. If you’re concerned about the lack of safe spaces for our unsheltered community members, you can give their offices a call and let them know that you support this legislation and would encourage them to support it, too. <br /><br />Danny Dromm<br />dromm@council.nyc.gov<br />718-803-6373<br /><br />Francisco Moya<br />fmoya@council.nyc.gov<br />718-651-1917<br /><br />The bill itself is here: https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4424152&amp;GUID=A763B8C0-DC29-415A-9FC0-A28335F20B20&amp;Options=&amp;Search=<br /><br />With more info here: https://www.1927saveslives.org/

				This problem is way bigger than anything I can even imagine how to solve. Congregating in shelters. Congregating outside. All COVID dangerous.<br /><br />Maybe the city should give each homeless person $20,000? And some soap and clothes and a job? <br /><br />I would vote for that.<br /><br />

				The homeless are obviously part of our landscape now.<br /><br />But it&#039;s the trash they leave everywhere&nbsp; that&#039;s dangerous and a health hazard.<br /><br />Maybe a trash education program for the homeless?<br /><br />Where the homeless are taught to care for their new community.

				I appreciated this short interview in the e-newsletter Epicenter NYC. (You can sign up for the newsletter here: https://epicenter-nyc.com/subscribe). The idea to carry a card of community resources seems good. <br /><br /><br />Dear Neighbor,<br /><br />Are you noticing more homeless people in your community? Among reasons for this: Warmer weather draws people out of shelters and onto the streets where there are fewer rules and no curfew. And because of Covid-19, the NYC Department of Homeless Services has been moving thousands out of shelters, where social distancing is impossible, into hotel rooms — often in some of the city’s more pricey ZIP codes. <br /><br />It’s become a showdown in certain neighborhoods. We spoke to Cari Feingold, a clinical social worker who has counseled homeless populations, on how to try to diffuse the tension. Her advice: <br /><br />What to give. Whether to give money is always a question people have. Feingold advises against it. Instead, she suggests providing personal hygiene products like deodorant, cleansing wipes and tampons and sanitary pads, which can be especially hard to come by. The travel section at stores like Target and CVS are good for stocking up.<br /><br />Resources. Consider creating a card listing local food kitchens, community fridges, mental health and detox clinics, and Covid testing locations. Keep several with you and hand them out. “You can only want for someone as much as they want for themselves. It’s all about being empowered,” Feingold told us. “Giving somebody a McDonald’s sandwich is not empowering. Giving someone a list of resources they can call? That’s empowering.” <br /><br />Who is that, Mama? How to explain the new neighbors to children? Come from a place of empathy. Explain that being homeless doesn’t make you a bad person, and it’s not a choice. If you come across somebody using drugs, Feingold suggests being honest: The person is sick, and what they are doing is bad for their body and illegal. <br /><br />Consider carrying Narcan. There are nearly 80,000 homeless people in New York City. The vast majority also suffer from issues such as mental illness and substance abuse. Fentanyl, a powerful and deadly synthetic opiate often lacing cocaine and heroin, is responsible for many overdose deaths in New York City. Naloxone, more commonly known by the brand name Narcan, is a nasal spray that helps reverse an opioid overdose. New Yorkers can secure Naloxone free of charge from community organizations and participating pharmacies, and several organizations offer free training on how to effectively use it. <br /><br />What if you feel threatened? If you see someone who appears to be a danger to themselves or others, Feingold recommends contacting the police and letting them know you are calling in regards to an emotionally disturbed person (EDP). That way, she said, they will send an ambulance and bring the individual to the hospital to be assessed. <br /><br />And most importantly, be sympathetic. <br /><br />

				The BQE underpass at 35th avenue has a sign from a NYC agency that states they will be removing belonging left.&nbsp; In the 2 months since it was pressure washed, it still seems rather clean except for the bird droppings.&nbsp; <br /><br />The homeless population has moved from the underpass to private properties in the lower 70&#039;s.&nbsp; Tuesday night I had 3 individuals drinking, smoking and passing out on my front steps.&nbsp; Saturday night I had a homeless man sleeping on a mattress in my neighbors parking spot and peeing in my garden.&nbsp; By the time police came the guy had left.<br /><br />

				I like the idea of a card and giving out hygiene products, but I think giving out a sandwich or even money (that might be spent on liquor!&nbsp; I like a glass of wine too!) is fine as well.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s important to support local organizations that help the homeless.&nbsp; The homeless and people with mental illness are NYC residents too and our neighbors.&nbsp; They are human beings.&nbsp; Please keep that in mind.&nbsp; Just like the gentrifiers are human and our neighbors.

				Whatever our various perspectives might be on homeless people living within our midst the current situation is not sustainable. We can all agree that living in our streets is a risk to those that live this way but also to all of us who also use the streets in the course of our daily lives.<br />I have no idea how to resolve this social problem but there is a political class that is meant to address neighborhood issues. So ideas/solutions please from Mr. Dromm, Ms.Cruz, Ms. Ramos, and Ms. Ocasio- Cortez.

There is not a lot that -can be done- for these folks without services that gather groups of people in places, which is still verboten because there is still a pandemic.

				The hard and sad truth about America is that the streets are not paved with gold. Regardless of how the American Dream is sold. <br /><br />Has anyone spoken to these folks? What is their story?<br /><br />Perhaps we need the media involved to truly get to the bottom of why they have ended up drunk and homeless. <br />As for insanely harassing those who pass...neither poverty nor the pandemic excuses that. Being poor does not pardon aggression.<br /><br />Trying to guess what led to this situation is difficult.<br /><br />There&#039;s a solution but without all the facts...it is hard to work out.<br /><br />There are documentary makers and media folks and social workers on this blog.<br /><br />Perhaps they can inform exactly why there is such a big problem now. <br /><br />And what these individuals were doing before COVID hit. (Day laborers?) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I still think that if enough of us call and make our voices heard, there will need to be a response. It&#039;s easy enough to write off one or two complaints, but we need to be a unified force. I think this includes regular calls/emails to:<br /><br />1. Elected Officials: Danny Dromm, Catalina Cruz, Jessica Ramos<br />2. Our community Board (who ironically is based in the building on 82nd street right across from the encampment)<br />3. The City (311)<br />4. The 115 (even though they don&#039;t bother to do much)<br />5. The Burger King Building Owner (there&#039;s a # to call on the building on a For Rent sign, this may be realtor, but I don&#039;t doubt if they start getting a lot of calls, they may take some action)<br /><br />For the record, I am neither anti immigrant or anti poor. I want a better quality of life for us all - this includes a safe and clean neighborhood and adequate services for the unhoused.

				KGDHP is absolutely right.&nbsp; As they say on the subway, if you see something, say something.&nbsp; I have found it much more efficient to make your complaint using the 311 online portal:<br /><br />https://portal.311.nyc.gov/search/?q=<br /><br />You can enter the issue in the search box, and then click on the type of complaint.&nbsp; Follow the directions and enter your complaint. You will likely need the nearest street address.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is crucial to use 311 because otherwise, our fair city and the NYPD will claim that no complaints were ever made.&nbsp; If you submit your complaint you are given a number that records the complaint.&nbsp; The city will/may finally respond to issues when there are too many complaints for them to ignore.<br /><br />Also, call your elected officials, or email them.&nbsp; It is your right to hold them accountable.&nbsp; Don&#039;t wait for someone else to do it.

				As both an immigrant and someone who grew up poor (I experienced food insecurity before it was a thing), I&#039;m not sure how being concerned for the safety of our community is anti-immigrant or anti-poor. As Alphabet person commented, being poor or being an immigrant does not excuse aggressive behavior, nor does it excuse a number of other issues that have been ongoing problems in the neighborhood long before the pandemic. I doubt that the pile on 82nd Street, or the collection on 35th Ave. were living their best lives before all of this.<br /><br />We need to stop using the pandemic as an excuse. It&#039;s just an easy way to explain away problems that we don&#039;t want to deal with. I&#039;m not saying that the pandemic didn&#039;t exacerbate certain problems (it did), but to use it as a catch all explanation in simply intellectually lazy at best. Ditto writing things off as anti-whatever.

				ClydeM, thank you for a thoughtful, informed, and accurate&nbsp; take on the issues facing our neighborhood (and our city and country as well).&nbsp; We can and should no longer look the other way, or make excuses for both our current situation, and the problems that preceded the pandemic.&nbsp; We have to make our voices heard since, unfortunately, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.&nbsp; That is what 311 and our elected officials are for.&nbsp; Perhaps you should run for office!
