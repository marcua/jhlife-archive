			<strong>Seth</strong>:
			<br />
			This is program A of a series of three programs of sevenlocalfilm.com docs of mine, mainly about Queens and immigration. The content and form of each program is distinct, but they each were shot in Jackson Heights-Elmhurst where they will screen at Terraza 7.&nbsp; And the Time of Covid has only made, I feel, the themes and issues they address and evoke very relevant now.&nbsp; I look forward to the postscreening conversations .<br /><br />You can read more about THE ACTOR IN HIS LABYRINTH as well as the entire series here: https://terraza7.com/event/the-actor-in-his-labyrinth-film-screening-filmmaker-seth-fein-qa/&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The entire series, 23, 24, 30 October @ 6:30 pm @Terraza 7, is free and open to all, thanks to City Arts Corps Grant from the NY Foundation for the Arts, NYC Dept of Cultural Affairs, the Mayor&#039;s Office for Media and Entertainment, and the Queens Theatre
