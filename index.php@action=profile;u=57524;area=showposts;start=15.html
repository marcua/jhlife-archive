This construction has been going on in full view for many months<br />on 78th st. What did I miss? Get the feeling that something like a person running for office is behind this and looking for a<br />agenda item. The cars using that inset for service calls, the people dropping off children and the many Parks staff that use<br />it seem to be part of why Northern Blvd., in that area, <strong>has been safer lately</strong>. Can&#039;t imagine what would happen if that<br />inset was removed for traffic on Northern. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Why not take this question to the actual park users this summer? Have people ask does it help or hurt the park? People<br />using Travers for sports and birthday parties might be loving this inset to unload. I would be sure it doesn&#039;t break down on<br />any socio economic divides here. Because it feels agenda driven on someone&#039;s part here...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />let&#039;s hear more about this conspiracy you surmise is the reason for anybody raising questions about this issue after it was brought to light and publicized by a local newspaper?&nbsp; &nbsp;How do you know that people that are raising concerns were aware of the details discussed in the article before reading the article?<br /><br />That entire area should become part of the park.&nbsp; The car dealer&#039;s land should be taken via eminent domain, as well as the small nursery school, for the betterment of the neighborhood. As far as people dropping their kids off with cars, Travers is a neighborhood park and I would estimate that probably 98% of the people who use the park live within walking distance and walk to the park.&nbsp; In terms of dropping off and picking people off, if the entire block were taken over, I am sure that a small drop-off/pick-up area could be incorporated.&nbsp;

					I used to take my child to the Garden School and have to walk past the dealer&#039;s business.&nbsp; The cars that drive around that 78th Street area, not just the dealer, are a danger to the children nearby.&nbsp; They have no regard for the kids.&nbsp; Some of the cars would literally block off the entire crosswalk forcing parents to walk around them and towards Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Things were so bad that they would have to have cops parked there during the morning and afternoon.&nbsp; It is no accident that the dealer recently reconstructed the building with the intention of maintaining access to 78th Street.&nbsp; We, as a neighborhood, should not let them do this.&nbsp; If anything, we should demand that the City, by eminent domain, take over the space and increase Travers Park&#039;s footprint.

					As a student, I used to live near Washington Square Park and would love to go there on the weekends to listen to the musicians meet up and play music.&nbsp; What are the chances that the neighborhood musicians will do the same once the park is renovated?&nbsp; I think that the layout of the park would be conducive in this respect.&nbsp;

					I went to Lally&#039;s and the prices seem about right considering the quality of the food.&nbsp; Everything is fresh and well made.&nbsp; Other places are cheaper, but sometimes you have to pay a bit more for quality and/or ambiance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my dining bills have gone up slightly ever since Lally&#039;s acquired its liquor license - I am halfheartedly complaining.&nbsp; In fact, I am planning on increasing Lally&#039;s rotation on my list of restaurants.&nbsp; <br /><br />My spouse, however, has complained about the windows and the sense that there is no privacy.&nbsp; I think it would be nice if they put some kind of art and/or decorations that would give diners a sense of privacy and also give the restaurant more of a personality, both on the inside and outside - depending on the art and/or decorations.&nbsp;

					Potential solutions:<br /><br />Turn signals for cars on 37th Avenue and as an added measure, restrictions on hours that turning is permitted to protect kids going to and from school.&nbsp; Modify the parking rules to limit parking for drivers loading/unloading passengers/goods, with 15 minute time limits.&nbsp; Turning 37th Avenue into a pedestrian only walk way (cars could drive straight through to and from Roosevelt Avenue but not turn into 37th Avenue).&nbsp; Cameras on all lights between 37th Avenue and 72nd and 89th Streets to catch speeding drivers and those who turn in violation of traffic law assuming my first proposal is adopted).&nbsp; Speed bumps on each street on 37th Avenue between 72nd Street and 89th Street.&nbsp; Red lights in all directions to allow pedestrians to cross the street.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s all I have so far.&nbsp; Do you have any other ideas?<br /><br />

					Hello Neighbors,<br /><br />I wanted to tap into the collective wisdom of our community concerning a remodeling issue that I have.&nbsp; On that note, I respectfully request that you provide me with recommendations of vendors who can build and install built-in bookshelves, with room for a TV.&nbsp; (I am aware that this topic has been discussed in the past, but the administrator suggested that I start a new topic.)<br /><br />The following link from the NYT On the Market section demonstrates the type of work that I would like to have done:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2018/12/06/realestate/on-the-market-in-the-new-york-region/s/09OTM-NYC-slide-2ZN2.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2018/12/06/realestate/on-the-market-in-the-new-york-region/s/09OTM-NYC-slide-2ZN2.html</a><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For those of you who have had built-in bookshelves installed in your apartment, any regrets?&nbsp; How much did it cost?&nbsp; Was it worth it?&nbsp; I want to as minimal depth to the bookshelves as possible; how deep are your bookshelves? <br /><br />Thank you for all your help.&nbsp; I truly appreciate it.&nbsp;

BTW There is no commercial rent regulation, and if you think LABEL REGULATION (WTF) is a contributing factor....I don&#039;t know what to say except:<br /><br />&quot; Greedy capitalist kicks out valued local store to rent gouge. &quot; <br /><br />Good luck with your randian dream.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did not mean to be unclear. I was suggesting that pure capitalism, which was raised by dssjh, does not really exist in New York City.&nbsp; To support my point, I in no way limited my examples to those that relate to store fronts.&nbsp; For instance, I pointed to transportation costs.&nbsp; What does the store fronts on 37th Avenue have to do with the metro train fares?&nbsp; Not much; but, with regards to my larger point, all of my examples point to areas in our lives where the government regulate the capitalistic forces - for good or bad does not matter to make my point.&nbsp; However, with regard to my larger point, I think it is hard for a small business to get started and survive the first five years because of the overbearing nature of the government regulatory apparatus in NYC, which are obstacles for a lot of small business owners.&nbsp; One mistake can literally put a place out of business, e.g., the Department of Consumer Affairs can assume that an employer violated the law with regards to all employees if they can show that the employer violated the law with regards to one employee and then use this to impose per employee penalties of up to $1,000 per employee and past employees. The employer can defend and win and end up giving all that money to a lawyer. <br /><br />Commercial landlords are not helping the situation either.&nbsp; They ask for incredible amounts of money and are willing to keep their properties vacant until someone pays up.&nbsp; The communities are the ones that ultimately pay the price.&nbsp; Ultimately, I hope the places rent for establishments that will serve the communities needs and will stick around for years to come.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a gastro-pub in the neighborhood.&nbsp; One can dream.

					I think if it were just plain capitalism, the storefronts would be rented.&nbsp; Capitalism doesn&#039;t really exist in NYC to the extent that the state and local government regulate rent, transportation costs (e.g. train fare, bridge tolls, gas taxes, etc.), terms of employment, liquor licenses, price labels (see: <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/about/PricingLaws.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/about/PricingLaws.pdf</a>), etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />My guess is that it is probably a confluence of factors, including unrealistic rental goals and government interference.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we lost two wonderful stores that served the needs of the community.&nbsp; Hopefully, capitalism will kick in at some point in the near future and maybe the neighborhood get vendors that will serve the community&#039;s needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I went to Mama Rosa&#039;s when they first opened.&nbsp; I was not too crazy about the cornmeal on the crust.&nbsp; I went back today and the pizza was excellent - no cornmeal or undetectable.&nbsp; It had a crispy crust, non-acidic flavorful tomato sauce, perfect amounts of high quality mozzarella cheese, and it was also cooked to perfection in a brick oven.&nbsp; I let my companion have a bite and she also agreed that it was excellent.&nbsp; I am ecstatic that we finally have a really good pizzeria in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I hope they get a beer and wine license soon.&nbsp;
