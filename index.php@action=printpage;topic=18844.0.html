				Hello fellow dog lovers! <br /><br />Our beloved doggie daycare go-to, Janet, moved away last year and we&#039;ve been looking for a replacement in the neighborhood to care for our Brussels Griffon a couple times during the week. Does anyone have a recommendation for a doggie playgroup or facility they love?<br /><br />Thanks so much!

				This must be Django&#039;s family! Jea&#039;s family misses Janet, too. We use Karin for dog walks (no daycare, though). Would welcome any other contacts to have as a backup!

				We miss Janet a lot too!<br /><br />We use NYC Pet Nanny for walks and Disco Paws in Astoria for daycare and are happy with both, but would love to know about any local daycare or boarding people have had good experiences with (especially in-home).

				Reviving this thread once again because I&#039;ve just started a job with grueling hours and would love to find someone in the neighborhood to look after my two pups (Shiba Inu and Brussels Griffon) a few hours during the week. Ideally it would be 3-4 hrs on Tuesdays and again on Thursdays OR Fridays (so 2 days in total). The other times my husband and my mom (in the same building) will look after them.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what would be IDEAL for us (but know we can&#039;t have it all!):<br />-- Someone to come to our place 3-4 hrs each Tuesday and Thurs (OR Friday)<br />-- Between the hours of 10am - 5pm (so, it could be 10am-2pm, 12pm-4pm, 11am-3pm, you decide)<br />-- We&#039;d ask for one 20ish min walk with the Shiba Inu (the Brussels Griffon will be babysat by my mom in the same building while you are walking). Not very far as he suffers in the heat. And then when you return, pick up the Brussels Griffon and hang in our apartment with them. You might play a game or two with them, but we wouldn&#039;t expect you to entertain them the entire time! <br /><br />In Return:<br />We&#039;ll have a basket of new toys each week to spoil them with (out of guilt for us working so much) and you would be welcome to use our WiFi and TV (and of course, A/C). <br />We&#039;ll provide you with your favorite snacks and drinks too. <br />If you&#039;re a freelancer, this would be perfect for you (bring your laptop and work a few hours next to dogs!). Or, if you&#039;re just looking to make some extra cash and LOVE dogs (not like!), this would be ideal.<br /><br />We&#039;d really love to have someone long-term, so if this is you (or you know of someone who would be perfect for our new dogsitter), DM me!
