				I noticed the other day that the Key Food on Baxter (over by the new Chipotle/Chick-Fil-A) is now a SuperFresh.&nbsp; The layout is quite a bit nicer, but at quick glance, the prices seemed a little higher.

				I checked Yelp reviews of the existing ones (I think Bay Ridge had the most reviews) and the reviews are not good. People complaining about expired foods and fish and meat smelling like bleach. https://www.yelp.com/biz/superfresh-supermarket-brooklyn-2?start=60 <br /><br />I will keep making my runs to Trader Joe&#039;s until we manage to get a decent market around here. Actually, the Trader Joe&#039;s in LIC is supposed to open in 2021, so that will make things a bit easier, although still not really convenient.<br /><br /><strong>Moderator note: there were two threads on this topic; both were merged into this one.</strong>

				I don&#039;t understand how people can still be complaining about the supposed lack of good grocery stores in the 80s. We have amazing green grocers, great butchers like Boina Roja, a bodega on every other corner for basics, the natural market on 84, and Mi Tierra.

				Went to take a look today. Not crowded, easy to move around. Didn&#039;t see anything out of the ordinary and prices looked a bit higher than the store on 37th Ave though they have a few &quot;opening&quot; specials, nothing I was looking for. Didn&#039;t have Fresca or 25 pack Good Sense 13 gallon kitchen bags. Bought a couple of rolls of toilet paper at the usual store brand price just to show willing. Cashiers masked but no surrounding shield. Haven&#039;t checked out the Baxter Avenue one yet.

On statistical measures, we come out as a low income area. Our median household income for 11372 is $60659 with a median of $41852 in one-earner households and $84745 in dual-earner households. Down in Rego Park it&#039;s noticeably higher: $66795 overall with $60767 in single-earner households and $116047 in dual-earner households. East Elmhurst is in between. I like to hammer on this, but the population of this board and our neighborhood online groups isn&#039;t statistically representative of the overall population of the neighborhood, which is *much* lower income and *much* higher percentage Latino than tends to be represented here.

We have amazing green grocers, great butchers like Boina Roja, a bodega on every other corner for basics, the natural market on 84, and Mi Tierra.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />People like to complain. They don&#039;t realize there&#039;s fresh food galore in JH, and they lament that frozen meal purveyor Trader Joe&#039;s won&#039;t return their calls.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know, but I always love to poke the &quot;why won&#039;t X upscale chain open in Jackson Heights&quot; (for any value of X) folks. The answer is usually &quot;for the same reason normal people can actually afford rent here.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I imagine rents in Rego Park are not that different than rents in Jackson Heights, yet Trader Joe&#039;s built a store there. <br /><br />Also, I assume you&#039;re referring to Trader Joe&#039;s as being &#039;upscale&#039; but not sure what you mean by that. If you mean that their products are reliable, fresh, innovative and the stores are clean and have excellent customer service, then I would agree. However, if you are equating upscale with expensive, then I don&#039;t agree at all. Trader Joe&#039;s prices are more reasonable <em>for quality goods</em> than anywhere else I could think of shopping -- including the stores here in JH (with the exception of the produce markets).<br /><br />And since this thread is about the new grocery store and not Trader Joe&#039;s, I should mention I took a swing through and took at look at the one product that I know how to do price comparisons for, the large Quaker Oats canister. At this new store it costs $6.99. At C-Town it&#039;s $6.49. At the market that used to be called Fruta Dona on 37th and 83rd, I recently bought it for $3.99. At Target it&#039;s $3.49. So that leads me to the conclusion that the prices are not much of a bargain here. I&#039;m sure they have some loss leaders and sales, so if you&#039;re shopping for something else, perhaps you&#039;ll find a decent price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;d be surprised. On statistical measures, we come out as a low income area. Our median household income for 11372 is $60659 with a median of $41852 in one-earner households and $84745 in dual-earner households. Down in Rego Park it&#039;s noticeably higher: $66795 overall with $60767 in single-earner households and $116047 in dual-earner households. East Elmhurst is in between. I like to hammer on this, but the population of this board and our neighborhood online groups isn&#039;t statistically representative of the overall population of the neighborhood, which is *much* lower income and *much* higher percentage Latino than tends to be represented here.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was talking about rent, which is what you referred to. <br /><br />Also, if our residents are under a strict budget for food, they might do better off to take the bus to Rego Park and do a big shopping at Trader Joe&#039;s vs pay the crazy prices for certain food items around here, like the example I gave for oatmeal at Super Fresh.<br /><br />And if we had a Trader Joe&#039;s here, they could save the money on the bus fare.

				I went shopping there and it seemed comparable to Foodtown although smaller with slightly less selection. I like it because it is closer to my building. I will probably do all my shopping there from now on because of the convenience.

				Trader Joe&#039;s is opening in LIC soon, right?<br /><br />At least you can get there by subway. <br /><br />Anywhere in NYC not near the subway lines is off my radar. (Like the far flung Trader Joe, Rego Park location)<br />I&#039;d much prefer to go to Manhattans&#039; Trader Joes by subway than shlep faraway by bus.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;As for the &quot;average&quot; resident of JH, it could be broken down very differently by separating the long box of the neighborhood into three. The area from Junction to say 85th street has a significant Latin population and larger households and am thinking lower incomes based on the retail in the area.<br />&nbsp; From 85th to about 75th is likely the highest earners in Jackson Heights and the higher priced apts and homes. Again, anecdotal looking a retail and home prices. Then from 75th to 69th is lower again with less density and many more homes with larger households and an ever growing Bengali/Nepalese community. Many more three/four generation family units in the lower numbers so seniors and children not working. <br />&nbsp;This is certainly non scientific but an educated guess on how things might realistically be counted here for population and income. As a whole Jackson Heights is said to be very diverse but there are pockets where many fewer of one ethnic or racial group lives than another even within JH.

				This is a little out of the way for me, but I heard some excellent reviews, so I brought my cart up to Northern for a big shopping trip.&nbsp; I was impressed by their selection and quality for a small grocery store.&nbsp; This is an excellent additional option in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Hopefully they&#039;ll get enough turnover to keep the perishables fresh and diverse.
