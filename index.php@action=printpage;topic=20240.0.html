				El Toum (formerly JuJu’s) has opened on 76th St just off 37th Ave. Middle Eastern/Lebanese fare for take-out, delivery &amp; eat in. Menu looks great, just what I’ve hoping for.

				Yes--I hope this is a big hit --I&#039;ve always wished Sami would be open late enough for us to get takeout for dinner from him. His cooked food was always excellent, but we never wanted a big meal for lunch. Love this menu and with delivery offered, it&#039;s perfect.

				first takeout experience tonight:<br /><br />El Toum appetizer platter - hummus, baba, tabbouleh, falafel. really top notch across the board. the dips were both super well spiced, the baba had a good hit of garlic. falafel very tasty, maybe a bit more crunch-to-soft-inside than i normaly like, but fresh&nbsp; tasting and made with care.<br /><br />chicken shwarma platter - also very good.&nbsp; juicy chicken, generous portion, rice had some personality. salad was, well, salad. a little bummed that they didn&#039;t have the pickles/turnips that were supposed to be part and parcel, but maybe next time.

				That&#039;s good to hear. No longer need to make the trek to Sunnyside if its that good. I do wish they had labneh though.

				Also tried it Friday for dinner. Very tasty! There were lots of customers, so it took a pretty long time to get the order--but I&#039;m happy they are off to a good start. They were out of baba ganoush (sp?) by the time we got there (late afternoon) so they definitely have to work the kinks out, but that&#039;s to be expected. It&#039;s also at a good price point. I hope it&#039;s a hit!

				&nbsp;Loved it! Very happy with soup, falafel and chicken platters. Plan to eat through the menu and love this addition to the JH neighborhood cuisine.

				My family also tried it for the first time tonight.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything was excellent!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been dreaming of a Middle Eastern restaurant in JH for a long (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=138.msg489#msg489) time (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=3043.msg20075#msg20075), and I&#039;m delighted that Sami has delivered!&nbsp; I will miss my bagel &amp; whitefish, but I&#039;m happy to make the trade.<br /><br />dssjh -- you weren&#039;t kidding about the babaganouj!&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s enough garlic in there to give it quite a kick.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the pickles and turnips are just right -- hopefully you&#039;ll get them next time.

				Ordered for the second time last night.&nbsp; &nbsp;Great food! Pan seared salmon special, mixed appetizers, salad. Top-notch Lebanese cuisine.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t crowded when we ordered at 5:30 and food came quickly.&nbsp; Come on neightbors!&nbsp; It&#039;s our obligation to keep Sammy in business!

				Very interested to try this place out. According to Igram, it looks like they will reopen on Monday 1/4. <br /><br />For folks looking for labneh, I really like the tubs made by içim at Lemon Farm. I spread some out on a plate and serve with a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of coarse salt and some Za’atar. They also have these amazing loaves of Turkish bread, that come in a few different configurations. I prefer the three round loaf version. Heavenly and would make a nice addition to the food you get at El Toum. ;)

				I&#039;ve had the falafel platter twice now, and also the hummus. All delicious. Hummus really tastes homemade and a nice but not overpowering garlic flavor. And an Instagram post from 4 days ago shows homemade labneh!
