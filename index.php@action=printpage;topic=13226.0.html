				Two weeks ago I found a young adult male cat sitting in the middle of 78 Street trying to lick some kind of ground in food substance off the pavement.&nbsp; He has been rescued and is in the process of healing.&nbsp; He had an abscess in his neck from a puncture wound and was severely malnourished. Despite all this he is gentle and very affectionate. He needs someone who willing to help him out. He has tested positive for FIV but can live a long and healthy life inside with proper nutrition in either a home with another FIV cat or alone. FIV is not airborne and is species specific.&nbsp; He is a black cat, estimated age is 3.&nbsp; If anyone knows someone who might to give this cat a second chance please contact me. Thank you.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;He is still waiting for a home! Now he eats treats from your hand, doesn&#039;t scratch the furniture and likes to have his head rubbed.&nbsp; He has grown a little chubby while living with me and his fur is getting silkier everyday. He would love a companion to play with or someone who can give him a lot of attention.&nbsp; He loves to play.&nbsp;

				What a beautiful cat!<br /><br />I want to point out, in case anyone is still not aware of it, that cats with FIV can live nice, long lives if they remain indoors and are well cared for.&nbsp; Such a diagnosis is by no means a death sentence and it does not mean that the cat will necessarily show any signs of illness.&nbsp; FIV is not contagious to humans and can only be communicated to another cat via a deep bite.<br /><br />If you have a friendly cat that might benefit from a companion, this sweetie may be just the one.&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand he is friendly to other cats but Dotley can confirm this, if you&#039;re interested.
