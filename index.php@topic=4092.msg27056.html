								<div class="inner" id="msg_27021">The Elevated line in Astoria is not much better if you ask me.&nbsp; There may be a couple of reasons why it appears to be better though. <br /><br />First the construction of the tracks etc. for the N and W trains appear to me to be wider which allows for a greater sense of space under the tracks. There&#039;s certainly more room for traffic to flow slightly better underneath as well. <br /><br />Second there is nowhere near as much commercial development under the N/W lines as there is under the 7 so ultimately there&#039;s less traffic and a few stretches of desolate space that is littered with all sorts of trash. <br /><br />Maybe up by Ditmars Boulevard there&#039;s comparable commercial development, and I would argue there&#039;s just as much dirt and filth there as there is on Roosevelt. But wider sidewalks make it seem like less. <br /><br />If Roosevelt had better lighting that might help matters a bit. If it didn&#039;t have buses going down it that would help traffic flow. If the 115th Pct. and the 110th Pct. could get together and police it properly that would likely help with crime issues. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_27028">At a recent event hosted by Jose Peralta I believe it was a captain or high level officer form the 115th reported that the crime rate had dropped in the area over the past few months. Additionally a representative of the Queens DA&#039;s office reported that the illegal social security card business had seen a dip as well in this area and is now largely concentrated in The Bronx. <br /><br />Clearly this doesn&#039;t mean Roosevelt has become the safest and cleanest Ave. in NYC, and I know data can be manipulated. But, sometimes it seems an area gets a reputation and keeps long after it has been cleaned up. Clearly, Roosevelt has a long way to go.&nbsp; It would seem continued efforts on enforcement of existing laws and a regular police presence would help to continue reducing crime on the avenue. <br /><br />As far as blaming all of Roosevelt&#039;s problems on undocumented immigrants, I&#039;m not buying it. Legal or not there will always be people committing crime, running drug and prostitution rings etc. I think it&#039;s misguided to think that rounding up one specific group based on immigration status will solve any or all of the problems plaguing Roosevelt. <br /><br />A multi-agency approach makes a great deal of sense. NYPD should focus on enforcing NYC laws, they should not (and are not) be in the business of enforcing Federal Laws. Let Homeland Security and ICE deal with immigration issues.&nbsp; Sanitation, local politicians, and other agencies should focus on clean up and improvement. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_27036">The street under the elevated trains in Astoria is not nice, (with the possible exception of Ditmars and 31st). But there&#039;s generally also not a lot of stuff there- the stores tend to be on the avenues (Ditmars, 23rd, 24th, 30th, Broadway), and Steinway (which has an underground). It&#039;s not nearly as developed with storefronts as Roosevelt- once you leave Ditmars and 31st- which has gotten so much nicer in the last 10 years- the stores on 31st are not stores that I generally went to.<br /><br />I lived in the Ditmars area from 2000-2002 and the quality of the stores on Ditmars and 31st between Ditmars and 24th has gotten so much nicer since then. Back then there was no Rosarios (well, they moved in around 2001), no Blooming Company, no sushi places, no thai places, and much more fast food and dollar stores.<br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_27055">Years ago, the then Community Board Chair asked the police department to place satellite precincts along Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; They would have been modeled after the storefront precincts you find in places like Philadelphia, or even Tokyo.&nbsp; Basically, you would take an empty storefront in a &quot;hot spot&quot; along Roosevelt, throw in desks and other equipment and deploy some officers.&nbsp; You establish a police presence in an area where crime is a problem. The cops also establish relationships with the merchants and residents.&nbsp; They become part of the community.<br /><br />I know that some people resist the call for more police, but I never bought into the philosophy that you set up a fortress-like precinct in one part of a community and have all the law enforcement resources work out of there.&nbsp; It isolates the officers from the community and the benefit of having the police close by is only shared by a few residents.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind getting off the subway late at night and having a satellite precinct a few doors down.</div>

Also, because of the overcrowding of people and businesses in such a narrow corridor, the Sanitation Dept. seems to have given up even a hint of a desire to keep trash from overflowing all over the place.&nbsp; They have now similarly abandoned other parts of the neighborhood as well and, if we did not have the BID pitching in to clean up parts of 37th Ave., that would look like hell too.<br /><br />The question is, how do we address this as a community?&nbsp; Individual complaints don&#039;t seem to go very far.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_27085">oooooh!!! looks like the truth hurts.<br /><br />First of all Username/jjhs you have a point about how our heritages yours/mine came here, so in essence we all need to pack clean up it up and give it back to the Indians.<br /><br />In the 1600&#039;s the Dutch/German were the first to come to NY and dominate and eradicate the American Indians the true Americans out of the this land. The oldest and riches families that came here were the Rockefeller&#039;s, Astors, The Bronx family<br />which the Bronx and one time was an estate. How&#039;s that for history....<br /><br />What I should have included but for got, so I will do it now is that one posters had said that the people were dreaming of yest-er year. Yest er year was when immigrants came here in the late 1800&#039;s/1900&#039;s, and followed the laws of the land<br />they kept it clean and did not turn it into what look like their home back from where ever. Hung the American Flag with pride and learned the language as best as they could. They came here humbled by the experience and tried to fit or blend in. <br /><br />They did not spit on the floor/ throw garbage on the ground nor did they trash apartments.<br />The mentality was way different back then and the caring and respect they showed is far different than today.<br />More over the men dressed well wore actual jacket and slacks, women wore dresses coats and would not dream of wearing some of the outfits that some of men and women wear today. Back most men and women didn&#039;t have much as far as clothes go except for the wealthy. However the one or two suits that did have were kept clean worn everyday. Back then people knew how to carry themselves today I have no idea what is going on in the minds of&nbsp; people.<br /><br />If I were to move to another country the right thing to do is ask what are the proper procedures to follow of the land,and not to piss anyone off or offend them that&#039;s all I am saying here. There are rules here that are broken from spitting on the floor to turning your terrace into a storage place that it makes it look like Beijing.....is what makes neighborhood look bad.<br /><br />Yet, from the sounds of it you seem like the type to plop down anywhere do as you feel, and make a comment well in my country it&#039;s ok to do this....Good night.</div>

I&#039;m sick and tired that JH is always getting slammed for everything , its like people have this whole stereotype in their mind that JH is some third world ghetto . Why ?&nbsp; because they see Roosevelt Ave or 82nd st and freak out. They say its shady , dangerous and dirty and judge JH as a whole. But, they don&#039;t notice that JH is pretty big and we have other main avenues and thoroughfares such as 37th, 35th , 34th, &amp; Northern Blvd and sooo on . These for the most part are very clean with the exception of 37th ave in some parts and most of our side streets are impeccable . Also, in all of the 20 years I have lived here I have never been a victim of a crime or seen one . Yes Roosevelt Ave might be shady and dirty at times , but there is more to JH than Roosevelt Ave , 74th st , or 82nd st , just as there is more than the Jackson Heights Historical District . The closed mindedness of people is ridiculous especially in those sites such as Queens Crap . They think Forest Hills is perfect , beautiful, and flawless IT&#039;S NOT ! Ever been on the corner of Continental Ave and Queens Blvd or the corridor that stretches to Austin St . OOOO boy some of the people who hang around that corner sure are shady and it&#039;s really dirty . FH might have Gap, B&amp;N, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic &amp; Eddie Bauer , but it also has sooo much crappy retail , actually a lot of bad retail that is almost or just as bad as the ones we have here . FH also does not realize that if it wasn&#039;t for Forest Hill Gardens , I highly doubt a majority of those big name retail stores would be there . FHGardens , spikes the demographics of FH as a whole , not only that but FH is huge in comparison to size and housing stock , there are huge apt buildings 20+ stories . I have thought of moving various times to FH and it does not justify at all to move there when your already living in JH . Basically take FHGardens away and the perks that it brought to FH , and there isn&#039;t much to desire in FH, it would be another Rego Park , not that there is anything wrong with Rego Park . When it comes to immigration , we are all immigrants unless YOU are a Native American . Being dirty has nothing to do with legal status , socioeconomic status , or with being an immigrant or not . In high traffic areas , especially with high foot traffic dirtiness is always an issue , be it here or in FH , or in Fifth Ave. The only way to stop it is to clean it up with the help of people like the DOE fund. Which did clean in JH for a while and let me tell you 82nd st and parts of Roosevelt were spotless , until they left&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> . So to blame any of these issues on factors like immigration is ridiculous. </div>
