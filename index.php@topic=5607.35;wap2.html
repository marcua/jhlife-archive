			It was the Earle. I saw the James Bond film Thunderball there. Like many of the other theaters in area --the Fair, the Polk--it changed to more adult entertainment at one point.

			I visited JH before I moved there in 1950. My aunt lived on 80th st right off Northern. I remember way before PS145 was built that there were tennis courts on that land. I was little, but I used to watch the people playing from her window. I also remember the GayDome bar on Northern between 80th and 81st streets

			My family moved to Jackson Heights from Astoria in 1943. We had an apartment on 73rd Street, north of 37th Avenue. I don&#039;t remember the address, but it abutted the building on the corner that was The Blue Haven -- when it was a respectable nightclub. I remember being a Junior Air Raid Warden, and boy didn&#039;t I think I was hot stuff. I went to P.S. 69 from the 3rd to the eighth grade; I was a cub scout at St. Marks Episcopal Church; and went to Mass at St. Joan of Arc. I grew up with a group of boys from the neighborhood that played all sports as a team called The Jackson Heights Trojans. I have so many great memories from that time of my life, I could fill a book. In 1987, Lew Ressequie, Joe Allen (the now famous restaurateur) and myself, Howard Giordano, organized a reunion at a Manhattan east side restaurant. Of the twenty or so kids that played on team at one time or another, we located eighteen guys, but only fourteen could make the reunion date. They came with wives, and one guy who couldn&#039;t make it, sent his sister as a stand-in. The evening turned out to be one of the most nostalgic evenings of my life.<br />More memories on another post.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
