				Hello everybody...<br />Summer with Kids Music Together in Jackson Heights and Woodside is now underway.&nbsp; There are some spots still available.&nbsp; Please see below for more information.<br />Have a wonderful summer!<br />Best,<br />Diane<br />_______________________________________<br /><br />Summer Semester 2011 has started at KIDS MUSIC TOGETHER<br />Come join us for a fun, special bonding experience with your child through music making in a nicely air-conditioned room !<br /><br />Summer semester starts on 6/21(Tue) and ends on 8/7(Sun) for 6 weeks with SUMMER 3 collection.- every semester you get a new set of music to sing and enjoy (No class during Independence Day weekend 7/2-7/4)<br /><br />If youâ€™re NEW to Kids Music Together and want to reserve a spot for a FREE trial class, please contact the office right away.<br /><br />Don&#039;t miss out on this great experience of 45-minutes of PURE FUN with your child every week!<br /><br />Music TogetherÂ® is an internationally recognized early childhood music program for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and the adults who love them! Since 1987, it pioneered the concept of a research-based, developmentally appropriate, early childhood music curriculum that strongly emphasizes and facilitates adult involvement.<br /><br />NOT too late to register !!!<br /><br />Musical development, like language development, is a continuous process that benefits from consistent exposure and reinforcement, so we encourage you to continue your participation through the summer.<br />Here is a link to an article about early childhood musical development on a British paper, in case you have missed.<br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/may/08/singing-children-development-language-skills<br /><br />Summer 2011 Class Schedule(6 weeks):<br />Jackson Heights(81-10 35th Ave, Community Church)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Tue.(6/21-7/26)-SeungHee-9:30am/10:30am/11:30am(3â€™s+4â€™s)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Thu.((6/23-7/28)-Suzanne-9:30am/10:30am <br />Sat.(6/25-8/6, no class on 7/2)-SeungHee 10:00am /11:00am(3â€™s+4â€™s)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Sunnyside/Woodside(49-10 43rd Ave, Woodside Ballet);<br />Thu.(6/23-7/28)-SeungHee-10:00am /11:00am<br />Sun.(6/26-8/7, no class on 7/3)-Suzanne-9:30am / 10:30am(3â€™s+4â€™s)<br /><br />3&#039;s&amp;4&#039;s class(for children born before December 2008) is more active physically as well as verbally to meet children&#039;s needs. We&#039;ll be introducing solfege (Do, Re, Mi,..etc) in our tonal patterns and we&#039;ll be playing rhythm patterns with more specific/detailed body movements. It&#039;s fundamentally same but basically more active. It all depends on each case, but some children sing more in class by this age, some still sing only at home. Making music shouldn&#039;t be forced, except a few rules to be safe in group-setup, of course, so parents&#039; understanding and participation are still very important, since it has to be fun for all !!!<br /><br />The tuition for summer is $150 if register(hand-in/postmarked) by 6/14, or $160 if register on/after 6/15.<br />Tuition includes 1)6 weekly classes,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2)2 CDs+songbook<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3)Parent Guide DVD(new family)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Makeup Policy; Everyone is allowed 3 makeups by signing up in the makeup book in advance.<br /><br />Additional class/sibling(over 6 m-o) fee is $60.<br /><br />Check our web site for more information, www.KidsMusicTogether.com and/or contact the office to check the availability.<br /><br />Contact the office (phone # 646-250-1177 or music2jh@yahoo.com) to inquire.<br /><br />ABOUT OUR TEACHERS:<br />Our teachers are not only trained by and registered at Music TogetherÂ® but also professional musicians/music educators with excellent backgrounds, while we participate Music TogetherÂ® workshops every 3 months in order to offer the most fun and educational classes.<br />SeungHee Han-Director- is a professional jazz vocalist/composer/instructor, who is a graduate of Berklee College of Music and holds a masters degree in jazz voice from New England Conservatory.
