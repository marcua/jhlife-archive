				I live in another part of Queens, but I hope to ask for guidance here. I live in a condo and my upstairs neighbhor (who&#039;s diagnosed with schizophrenia) has been causing water damages to my bathroom and hallway ceilings by intentionally clogging her toilet.&nbsp; It happened 10 times last year, but never as bad as two weeks ago when water was pouring down and the FDNY had to come because water was getting into the bathroom light.&nbsp; They got her attention by breaking her window and found it was a &#039;clogged toilet&#039;.&nbsp; It happened again today, but this time, FDNY didn&#039;t do anything since my ceiling was taken out (was planning to fix it up and test for mold), so no water through the light fixture.&nbsp; They just shrug their shoulders and left. I was in disbelieved and extremely stress. I know I can take legal action, but yes, money. Besides that, are there other organizations and public help that I could reach out to? My sanity is on fine line and i can&#039;t fix anything if she keeps torturing us like this.&nbsp; Although she has a mental illness, my family and I are the victims here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for listening.

Legal / Police might be your only option. Maybe against both the tenant and the mgmt company not doing anything about it. Maybe just stop paying your maintenance until they help to do something about it. What good are they and all the rules they throw into the mix if they do nothing when the rubber hits the road.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if you left a bag of garbage outside your apt door they would be all over you threatening fines.

				My condolences. Strong tenant laws are needed to protect 99% of cases against tenants by greedy landlords and vindictive neighbors,<br /><br />&nbsp;but<br /><br />&nbsp;if you’re the 1% of tenants/owners who have been fucked by the inability to evict an irredeemably problematic neighbor/tenant….. it’s no consolation.<br /><br />I would&nbsp; search for advice on these sites (or post the same question there)<br /><br />https://old.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/<br /><br />https://cooperatornews.com/category/qa<br /><br />good luck<br />

				In the past, some local officials have sponsored free legal clinics. Can you check with your local elected officials to see if they have anything like that coming up, or can point you in the right direction?

				Thanks everyone. I know her property is under a guardianship, so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the route j should take or contact the adult protective services cause frankly she&#039;s incapable of living independently without jeopardizing neighbor safety.

				No practical advice,&nbsp; just empathy. Many years ago, i lived in a Greenpoint tenement (where my old apartment now rents for $2700) and had a very similar situation. One extra complication. the troubled person in question, in the apartment just above ours, was the adult daughter of the landlords, who she lived with.
