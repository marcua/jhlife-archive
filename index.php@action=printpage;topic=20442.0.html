				Saw this story on a couple of the local news sites, which mentioned that other branches are planned to be used. Mainstream news reports &quot;a flood&quot; of vaccine expected shortly, so maybe it will be as easy as flu shots.

				To me it&#039;s criminal that there has not been a vaccination effort in Coronal/Jackson Heights where the epicenter was one year ago.&nbsp; <br />The politicians have been rushing to open centers where they can get votes, and sadly, many residents in these zip codes can&#039;t legally vote.<br />Shame on them!<br />(hopefully, someone will prove me wrong and there are a bunch of vaccine sites I don&#039;t know about!)

You would think they would be going up and down the block in a Mr. Softee type truck and announcing them for one and all. People here <em>are </em>getting the vaccines but many I speak with have gone far and wide to get them with few people receiving shots locally. WHY?

Maybe when more doses of Johnson and Johnson are available, the city can set up pop-up sites in churches, etc. like they did for testing. I believe the other vaccines are a little too fragile and need specialized equipment for keeping them at a low temperature.<br /><br />Also, there could be community events that people could attend to help them sign up for the vaccines online, since a many (even those who are computer savvy) have found challenging.<br /><br />
