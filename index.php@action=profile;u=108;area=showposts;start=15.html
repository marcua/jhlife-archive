					I have about thirty boxes to give away.&nbsp; Some are small wine/liquor boxes but most are medium sized boxes.&nbsp; Most of them are in pretty good shape (they were used to store stuff during a renovation so a few are a bit dusty).&nbsp; I&#039;m in the mid-80s but could perhaps drop them off if you can&#039;t arrange to pick them up.&nbsp; I would prefer to arrange to give them away Sunday or Monday 3/28-29 if possible.

					Hmmm - I thought they first changed owners a while ago when they changed from Zabb to Zabb Zabb (and I think were no longer connected to the Astoria and Manhattan locations).&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I had trouble placing an order - I wondered if they were changing owners/management again.&nbsp; That night, I switched to getting delivery from Ayada.&nbsp; I&#039;ve now gotten delivery several times from Ayada and have been very happy so you might want to give them a try.

					Count me as another happy Matrix-goer.&nbsp; It does depend on what the person looks for in a gym, and I miss the New York Sports Clubs I used to go to in other neighborhoods.&nbsp; After moving here, I used to drive to the NYSC in Astoria, but paying to park in the municipal lot and the ever-increasing NYSC fees got to me.&nbsp; The free parking at Matrix makes a big difference - if you have a car (and can park back in JH afterwards).&nbsp; Still seems funny to me to drive to the gym, but until something else opens up nearby, it works for me.&nbsp; There are also NYSC locations convenient by subway, as Shelby2 mentioned.

					Hi Shelby - timing definitely makes a difference.&nbsp; I find that at 8, if I have walked all the way to the end of the platform, I can usually get a seat at 82nd st or, if not, sit once people leave at 74th st, or, at the least, it isn&#039;t that horribly crowded.&nbsp; By 8:15, even the ends of the trains are sometimes uncomfortably crowded often and occasionally horribly so.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t swear to it, but I think it thins out again by 8:45 (and is a breeze after 9 - I often am on the train after 9, but rarely do I get on at 8:45 so I&#039;m not sure).&nbsp; The 7 runs at such full capacity that it doesn&#039;t take much for it to get overloaded and then trains start skipping 82nd st.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t happen that frequently, but it is frustrating when it does happen.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 7 runs so frequently that I rarely have to wait long for a train that is stopping.<br /><br />It definitely takes longer to get to Manhattan at rush hour on the 7 then it does at other times, just because the train is stopped longer in the stations.&nbsp; I usually don&#039;t switch to an express b/c those are usually crowded.&nbsp; Hope that is helpful!

					I&#039;m a big fan of Don Francisco&#039;s on 37th between 85th and 86th.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he&#039;s only open Fri-Sun for the past year or so, but great meat and the butcher is very knowledgeable and helpful.&nbsp; Not a massive selection - go for the beef or pork - but good stuff.&nbsp; He has no labels or price tags (I think there is a price list on the wall), but fair prices, especially for the quality.&nbsp; Plus, you can&#039;t get thick pork chops at supermarkets anymore, nor big racks of ribs!&nbsp; Pretty good sausages as well.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been meaning to go to Ottomonelli&#039;s but never quite make it.&nbsp; Maybe this weekend!

					I find epicurious and their readers&#039; reviews invaluable.&nbsp; There&#039;s a neat new website that prints recipes from cookbooks:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cookstr.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.cookstr.com</a>.&nbsp; It&#039;s still in beta-form I believe, and so there aren&#039;t that many recipes (they don&#039;t seem yet to have up recipes from a lot of the chefs/cookbook authors they list as contributors, for instance) - but the search engine is really nicely done.

					Anyone try the new seafood store on Northern, around 83rd I think?&nbsp; Called Red Lobster: I wonder if that&#039;s a copyright infringement!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been in yet, but my husband stopped by and said that some stuff looked good/some not so much - but got some nice shellfish there for New Year&#039;s Eve.&nbsp; We even ate the oysters raw and no one got sick . . . I&#039;m pretty sure the oysters were from there - I know he also got some stuff at the seafood counter in Super Compare (what used to be Popular on Northern but is about 200 times better).&nbsp; The seafood counter inside Super Compare also seems to have pretty varied quality, but at least with these options, there&#039;s some possibility of getting fish without trekking to Corona or Astoria!

					Even better than Fage (especially since I think their yogurt has gone slightly down hill recently now that it&#039;s being made in the US rather than in Greece - still the best of the big brands) - anyway, better than any of the big brands is Kesso - made nearby in E Elmhurst!&nbsp; Sold in markets and at their retail stores.&nbsp; Funny thing is I&#039;ve been to The Yogurt Place II in Soho, but never tried their original location on 77th north of Ditmars. <a href="http://www.yogurtplacenyc.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.yogurtplacenyc.com/<br /></a><br />I love the preserves they serve with the yogurt at the Soho store - I&#039;ll have to see if you can buy individual servings like that at the E Elmhurst location.<br /><br />I think Trade Fair carries Kesso?&nbsp; Maybe the health food store as well?&nbsp; I know I&#039;ve bought it around here, just now sure where.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve seen it at Berry Fresh Farms in Astoria as well.
