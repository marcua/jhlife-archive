				You can say that again. AOC&#039;s narcissism makes her blind to the fact that attending that event reveals her hypocrisy and is a mockery of her so called ideologies. And betrays her constituents in Jackson Heights. Astounding.

				This reminds me of Melania&#039;s fashion statement. &quot;I really don&#039;t care, do u?&quot; When Melania visited the children detained at the border. <br /><br />Equally tone deaf. But both instances reveal their truths.<br /><br />AOC&nbsp; craving to be part of that rich MET world. Melania not really caring. <br /><br />

				^One could argue -- as A O-C will, no doubt -- that unlike Melania&#039;s fashion faux pas, hers was intended to subvert the event and its exclusionary sociopolitical implications. Unfortunately, despite a &quot;Tax the rich&quot; slogan on a designer dress, attending a gala for the 1% gives the far right even more fodder against any real progressive agenda. <br /><br />At the same time, what did we on the left really expect from someone whose initial funding came from a &#039;techbro&#039;? Color me surprisedNOTsurprised, though still very disappointed.

				I don&#039;t understand the criticism. First it was - she&#039;s an unqualified bartender. Then it was - she&#039;s a fake because she graduated college and was taped dancing with her fellow students.

The cost of the Met Ball for her and her outfit can be up to $100K. Or more.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I still see lines for food distribution in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />And AOC&#039;s platform is for the under-privileged. Not the over-privileged.<br /><br />The juxtaposition is astounding. And comes across as dissonant.<br /><br />It&#039;s having your cake and eating it too.

				It&#039;s great to see folks in the nabe engaged and passionate about what happens in local politics and beyond.<br /><br />Ultimately, unless you&#039;re AOC, one will never know for sure her true intentions, which is precisely the problem.&nbsp; Her action is open to interpretations, due to the mismatch between rhetoric and deed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Her defense of attending the event are basically two-fold, per her social media posts and interviews: 1) she was invited as a NYC official due to her responsibilities in overseeing local cultural institutions; and, 2) desire to break the fourth wall (her words) by representing minorities at an elite event and spread the taxation message.<br /><br />The former excuse is simply laughable and i will leave it at that.&nbsp; With respect to the latter, as a social media maven, she doesn&#039;t need tips from me about whether there&#039;re more effective ways of getting her messages across while wearing that same dress all at the same time.&nbsp; By disinfecting any potential backlash through social media posts prior to the event, she knew it was a questionable call.&nbsp; I can only hope folks willing to give her the benefit of the doubt are right-- I&#039;d like to see the likes of Anna Wintour come out in unequivocal support of economic justice as a result of AOC&#039;s bridge-building exercise at the Event.&nbsp; Then again, I&#039;ve been in NYC long enough to realize there&#039;re very few Warren Buffetts in the world when it comes to taxing the wealthy.<br /><br />Corruption comes in many forms-- monetary bribery is but one egregious and obvious manifestation.&nbsp; For the good of the neighborhood and progressive causes, I certainly hope AOC remains steadfast to her original intentions.&nbsp; It would be a shame to see her turn into a &quot;Clintonista.&quot; Finally, I&#039;d caution against personality cults in general; history is replete with examples of their failures, whether they&#039;re left- or right-leaning.&nbsp; As a politician, she deserves and needs to be scrutinized for all her actions, no more and no less.

				AOC is very naive and inexperienced if she thinks she &quot;owned&quot; the rich by wearing that dress with a &quot;message&quot;.<br /><br />She will now be the guest of honor at every celebrity/grand/rich event. She will become the &quot;virtue signal&quot; that the rich require to look &quot;good&quot;. She will be used by them. Not the other way round, which is what she incorrectly thinks.<br /><br />She has revealed that her flaw is &quot;she likes to hang with the wealthy&quot;...and with that flaw in character, the future will unfold to show that the person becomes a lapdog for the rich.&nbsp; While deluding themselves that they are doing &quot;good&quot;. <br /><br />I repeat, it wouldn&#039;t happen to Bernie.

				I am a fan of AOC, and I think her dress choice was brilliant.&nbsp; You did not need to have it explained, because it is self explanatory.&nbsp; She is a genius at social media, and the GOP is terrified of her and what she represents.&nbsp; <br />I am also a huge fan and supporter of Bernie, but I also think that Biden was a wise choice overall -because he was electable.&nbsp; <br />No matter what AOC does, she will have people who attempt to denigrate her and dilute her powerful messages.&nbsp; <br />Rock On AOC!

				&nbsp; Is AOC a help to the Democratic agenda when her brand gets labeled Socialist? In Florida, the Democrats lost some races by as many as 20 percentage points based on associations that could be drawn to Socialist agendas. I like her style and think she&#039;s smart and sassy but right now<br />... is this working for the country where Democracy is hanging by a thread?

Because character predicts future actions. AOC will receive a ton of invitations to fancy events now. She will be used as a virtue signal for the wealthy. <br /><br />I have read other Jackson Hts online forums. Her Lantinx base certainly isn&#039;t fooled by her action.They feel betrayed. I had to look up the Spanish words they used to describe her. Those words weren&#039;t pretty. <br /><br />Yes, for many Lefties she ticks all the boxes.

				As I follow AOC closely, the more I see confusing behavior. <br /><br />She abstained from the second vote for defunding Israel&#039;s Iron Dome.<br /><br />She is probably learning that when you attend the Met Ball there is a price to pay. No ticket is truly free. She probably thought she could influence them.

				The pathetic invocation of holocaust survivors&nbsp; is the worst kind of concern trolling, worthy of the gutter press. You <strong>really</strong> sink to some new depths. <br /><br />Firstly, you mean, &quot;descendants of holocaust survivors&quot;, since there are very few actual survivors alive in Israel -&nbsp; or anywhere else. <br /><br />Secondly,&nbsp; <strong>My family is jewish. Most of my immediate family from one or two generations back survived the holocaust - some did not.</strong> . I have branches of my&nbsp; <em>cousins</em> families who were <strong>entirely</strong> wiped out, who would be disgusted by your use of the Shoah to score points. <br /><br />&nbsp;I say to you now:&nbsp; stop invoking the most awful genocide from 80 years ago to score rhetorical points in an <strong>unrelated </strong> conflict.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Again, I ask you to clarify what you said<br /><br />&quot;She is probably learning that when you attend the Met Ball there is a price to pay. No ticket is truly free. She probably thought she could influence them. And now, of course we see that she is the one who can be influenced.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Who do you mean by &quot;them&quot;.</strong><br /><br />If you&#039;re not willing to clarify this, it merely says &quot;I&#039;m willing to make outrageous and unsustainable insinuations&quot; and then invoke the HOLOCAUST when someone calls you out. <br /><br />We have words for people like that.<br /><br /><br />

				When you are casting a voting to make a point, and not make the world better, you have become part of the problem IMHO.<br />The problem with Washington is the all-or-nothing mentality and the lack of compromise and civility.
