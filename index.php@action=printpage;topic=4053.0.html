				Wow - a sign in the window of the former M &amp; V Bagel Cafe - <strong>Slims&#039; Bagels is coming soon. </strong> &nbsp;<br />If this is the same one as in Douglaston (along the expressway) then really good bagels and great bialys. Also good stuff to go with bagels - assorted cream cheeses, salads, etc. <br /><br />Maybe we won&#039;t be lost without our cafe.

				I was a regular at M&amp;V for 5 years when I lived on 85th St preferred eating in.&nbsp; I would like to return to the new place (Slim&#039;s) but only if they have seating since I&#039;m 9 blocks away.&nbsp; I also noticed no seating on the website.&nbsp; &nbsp;What we don&#039;t know is how much space is in the back area where food was prepared.&nbsp; If its a large space and they bring in the food from Bayside/Little Neck they may have seating.&nbsp; What they must do is limit seating to 20 minutes with a minimum price.&nbsp; When I went a large group of seniors would sit at several tables and sip on a cup of coffee similar to what&#039;s going on at McDonald&#039;s at Roosevelt &amp; 76th St where coffee for seniors is 65 cents.&nbsp; McDonald&#039;s posted a sign which is ignored.&nbsp;

Tables and nice lighting would be much appreciated and<br />if the seniors spend lots of time there, I&#039;m happy to see them out and about. Some day,<br />god willing, I&#039;ll be there myself and hope to be treated well then.

				I think it&#039;s great that they have seating even if it&#039;s in the form of counters and stools.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would imagine that for a small business paying such high rent on 37th Ave that they have to do what they can to keep some turnover going.&nbsp; If you provide tables for your customers and then those customers come and stay for hours and only buy one bagel each, the business is probably doomed to failure. <br /><br />It seems like counters and stools is a nice middle ground between tables and no seating at all.

				The concept of bagel stores with tables and chairs seems to work in Astoria and Manhattan and everywhere else, why not Jackson Heights?<br />Is rent on 37th Ave that much more?&nbsp; If you are paying about $5-$6 for a bagel with cream cheese spread and coffee, it&#039;s nice to be able to sit for 15 minutes and enjoy.

				They now have changed the sign to the new name--any idea when the long anticipated bagel store will open.&nbsp; Peeked inside and saw they had shelves of items such as Ragu spaghetti sauce and Domino sugar.&nbsp; Can&#039;t remember the last time I walked into a bagel store and picked up tomato sauce.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t look like they offered much room to sit...so hope the bagels are outstanding!

				That&#039;s funny...a bagel store opens but there are no bagels. Does anyone know if they have bagels by now?&nbsp; Was thinking of heading over this morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				I just got back and they have bagels.&nbsp; I ordered just one sesame seed bagel and just put it to the test and it was good.&nbsp; The place was busy and I overheard the owner mention that they plan to close at 4PM but eventually will open until 10PM.&nbsp; They removed the Ragu tomato sauce and other items that didn&#039;t belong.&nbsp;

				Yes, the bagel store/cafe does have bagels.&nbsp; Stopped by and was surprised that I got a seat at one of the two tables.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to be too hard on a new local place...so I will say the bagels were decent.&nbsp; Asked for scallion cream cheese and got plain...has some of the same workers serving from the old M&amp;V.&nbsp; The selection of chips and other food items were good and &quot;upscale&quot; by JH standards.&nbsp; Place is clean, definitely not a place to linger. But, glad the Ragu sauce was removed! Maybe they can put some benches outside to sit and enjoy one&#039;s bagel.&nbsp;

				Went there on Sunday to try the bagels and have to report they were good!&nbsp; Staff were friendly and pleasant and when I went to pay for my 4 bagels they said, welcome have one on the house.&nbsp; Very nice and a good addittion to the neighborhood.&nbsp; They have a few small tables and a counter along the window on 86th with stools.

				They have employed 3-4 people from the old bagel shop so I was happy to see that.

				We weren&#039;t thrilled- the bagels didn&#039;t seem boiled, so they didn&#039;t have that nice hard shell. I had an everything bagel and found it rather bland. The inside was nice, it was clean, attractive and they had a nice looking selection of salads and spreads. I might go back to try some of their sandwiches and wraps. For now though, I&#039;m sticking with the Bagel House for my bagels.

				Most places stopped boiling them years ago<br />they took the shortcut and &quot;steamed&quot; them so they have never tasted right<br />you have to find places that still do it the old fashioned way

				tried for the first time today, and while the folks behind the counter could not have been nicer, i was underwhelmed by the bagel. a little too fluffy and kaiser roll-like, and as someone else said, kind of bland. the poppy could have used a little more poppy as well. the salads did look good, so i will probably pop in for a later day sandwich test sometime.....

				I agree about the overall flavorless quality of the bagels.&nbsp; I have tried sesame, cinnamon/raisin and poppy-seed and found them all to be dry and relatively without taste.&nbsp; So sad!&nbsp; I really wanted that corner to be a success.

				Today I got a chance to get lunch from Slims Bagels on the corner of 37Th Ave. and 86Th Street and have to say it was surprisingly delicious---Not to mention that it is about the only &quot;normal&quot; deli in town.. I had a Cuban Paninni which was great! He has a large selection of bagels, spreads and sweets along with all the regular Deli stuff....Naked juices, bagel chips, cookies, starbucks, and flavored coffees.&nbsp; There is counter space if your into eating there. It is a great addition to the neighborhood and I would recommended trying it
