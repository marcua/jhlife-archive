			<dd class="postbody">
				Until yesterday, I had been very pleased with Lemon Tree grocery on the northwest corner of 78th Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; They actually aimed higher then many of our other businesses, and have an inviting store with great products.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since I live on 78th Street, I was severely disappointed when they chose to install a for-profit clothing donation box on a residential street.&nbsp; I walked into the store, did not see the man I assume is the owner, but one person inside did admit that they had it placed there.&nbsp; I explained that they are in a NYC-designated historic district, and they cannot install semi-permanent objects - like a donation box - on it.&nbsp; (Some of you may remember that thanks to the JHBG, Time Warner&#039;s illegal cable boxes were removed over a decade ago for the very same reason).&nbsp; <br /><br />Of couse, he could care less.&nbsp; I explained that I can no longer patronize a business that does not respect my block... or any block for that matter.&nbsp; So I will take my business elsewhere until is it removed.&nbsp; This condition has already been reported to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Councilmember Dromm.&nbsp; Objects like this do not belong on our streets, regardless of the block.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask you to walk into Lemon Tree and express your concern about their decision to install a for-profit clothing donation box.&nbsp; Ask them to remove it.&nbsp; Remember to always vote with your dollars.&nbsp; That is the only way our businesses will understand our expectations.&nbsp; Thank you.

				Typical response from a JH store owner. Just last night someone told me how they reported store owners strangling street trees on 37th Avenue with lights, just to put them right back up after being told to remove them by the Parks Dept. <br /><br />I will not use Lemon Tree anymore. I&#039;m sick and tired and I&#039;ll buy my fruit in Manhattan.

				That really is so rude of them. Maybe reporting them to the&nbsp; Transportation Dept will yield quicker results? I will look online and do it myself tonight. And I will also report any trees that have lights on them. Jeez, some people just don&#039;t care about anything but themselves and making money at the expense of the neighborhood.

				Could someone post a photo?&nbsp; I won&#039;t have the chance to go by there for a while.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the box is still there next time I pass by, I will let the owner or employees know I won&#039;t be shopping there til it&#039;s removed.&nbsp; It sounds ugly, illegal and unnecessary.&nbsp; There are clothing donation boxes on 86th St. between Northern and 34th Ave by the Super Compare foods, and they can be a huge eyesore especially when the clothing is not picked up and piles of donations appear above and around the outsides of the boxes.<br /><br />

				I actually had to look this up in Google -&nbsp; I had no idea there were &quot;for profit&quot; donation boxes!&nbsp; What a scam.&nbsp; I walked by today and saw it - It&#039;s placed on the side street - big and green/white.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually donate at the green market.&nbsp; That at least seems legit.

				Good morning,<br /><br />Just spoke with, John, the owner of Lemon Farm.&nbsp; I told him that there are posts on Jackson Heights Life relating to the clothing bin.&nbsp; He indicated that he wasn&#039;t aware that it was a huge concern to some and that he understood that he was helping those less fortunate.&nbsp; He as well does not want to lose business due to this bin.&nbsp; Obviously, there is some misunderstanding.&nbsp; If someone can approach him directly and tell him what he is doing wrong that would be great.&nbsp; He welcomes your feedback.<br /><br />Good luck!!<br /><br />Marlene Flores and The Family

				Good news.&nbsp; According to Councilmember Dromm, the for-profit box in front of Lemon Farm will be removed next week.&nbsp; Let&#039;s watch to make sure it happens.<br /><br />I am confident that it will be removed, and I have no problem patronizing the store again.&nbsp; So hopefully this is a lesson where legitimate community concerns can effect positive change in our commercial district.&nbsp; This blog is an excellent way to share information quickly and easily.

				Glad that this will be removed and that the owner is (somewhat) receptive to customer&#039;s concerns; I hadn&#039;t noticed it but I haven&#039;t been down there for a week or so.<br /><br />I want to also add that you can donate old clothes at the Greenmarket on Sunday.&nbsp; Not sure whether it&#039;s a for-profit company that&#039;s doing the collecting, but they&#039;re there.

				I still agree the box doesn&#039;t belong there, but I did just find an interesting article about this particular for-profit company, US Again, that alleges they approach business owners and dupe them into thinking they are a charity so that they can be allowed to leave their for-profit box on business grounds rent-free. <br /><br />http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/millions-clothing-donations-diverted-charity/nFgRJ/<br /><br />And a report by another &quot;investigative blogger&quot; who tries to dig deep into the company&#039;s practices.&nbsp; http://nachalooman.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/usagain-donation-drop-boxes-in-da-hood-can-we-trust-it/ It&#039;s hard to sort out what&#039;s true or false, but it does seem that there&#039;s controversy around this for-profit clothing donation company.

				And Time Magazine &nbsp;(http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,461839,00.html) has this to say about USAgain:<br /><br /><strong>And potential donors who balk at USAgain&#039;s for-profit status may be even less pleased to know that the firm is run by Scandinavians associated with a secular cult whose leaders are on trial in Denmark for tax fraud and embezzlement. No USAgain executives have been accused of any wrongdoing, and Wallander says of the cult, &quot;That has nothing to do with how I run this business.&quot; But knowing that it is a business might influence where donors drop off their clothes.</strong><br />

				Well thank you so very much for preserving the entire landmark district for all of us. And who exactly appointed you as the head of the landmark district gestapo? The point of my post was that the immediate threat of an organized boycott seemed a bit extreme and dare I say overly melodramatic?

				Just wanted to say &quot;THANK YOU&quot; Jhlifer for getting the box removed . While I shop at this particular store daily, <br />&nbsp;( I&#039;m so so&nbsp; happy they opened here) the box was a big turn off to me. It lets businesses know that people care about&nbsp; the neighborhood. Granted that there are many other more pressing problems, but the little things deserve our attention and are equally as important. Shop on......without the box!

				how is voicing objection &quot;gestapo like&quot;? No one walked over to Lemon Farm and broke his windows or painted symbols on his awning.&nbsp; &nbsp;If people want to object by organizing a non-violent form of demonstration that&#039;s a form of conscientious objection.

				Just WTF was the real issue here? The placement of the clothing donation box itself? Or the fact that it was a for-profit endeavor run by some alleged cult? Would it have been less offensive if it were a Salvation Army or Goodwill box? Would that have made the reaction to it less vitriolic? JH certainly has more than its share of homeless and working poor who could potentially benefit from donated clothing, bedding, towels, etc. <strong>Again, my issue on this forum was the overreaction.</strong> The clothing box was a &quot;source of threat&quot;? -- Really?! <br /><br />What&#039;s ironic is that you and certain other members on this forum think of yourselves as the self-appointed preservationists and spokespeople for the entire historic district. And don&#039;t rationalize your actions by calling it &quot;conscientious objection&quot; when in reality you DID threaten the livelihood of a local business. This issue could have been resolved amicably without anyone needing to start a movement on this forum because they have nothing better to do with their time. The box is gone; move on to your next crusade already.... Hopefully an important matter this time.

				I hope that Councilmember Dromm is not spending too much of his time responding to this kind of complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;The serious issues which should be his focus and which hevaily impact our community of primarily moderate income and working people are: education, affordable housing, crime, hunger, poverty, homelessness, poor working conditions/low wages, exploitation of undocumented people, long term unemployment and many, many others. <br /><br />Aesthetic issues and quality of life issues are also serious and important. <br /><br />But based purely on the picture posted, I donâ€™t really get why people were quite that upset about the drop box. Itâ€™s not beautiful. But it doesnâ€™t seem particularly ugly/dirty/menacing&nbsp; either.&nbsp; It just&nbsp; looks like a big mail box painted green and white.&nbsp; &nbsp;All else being equal would prefer not to see it there, but not that big a deal.<br />

				Look at the language of the first couple of posts in this thread.&nbsp; It seems pretty clear to me that the driving force behind objections to the drop box, and the call to boycott and get the Councilmember involved was based on concerns over appearance, i.e. the box was too big, unsightly, out of keeping with the look of the landmark district etc.&nbsp; I think itâ€™s a bit disingenuous to claim otherwise.&nbsp; <br /><br />If USAgain is a bad outfit, they should be shut down.&nbsp; Is anyone asking Councilmember Dromm to follow-up on that front now that the nasty box is out of the way?&nbsp; <br /><br />How about replacing the US Again dropbox with a box belonging to a legitimate charitable organization, as a prior poster seemed to suggest (perhaps rhetorically)?&nbsp; Put it in the same spot as the US Again box, which seems to be centrally located and convenient for all wishing to make a donation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any problems with that?<br />

				Thanks Shelby2 for posting these pictures. I live on 86th street and that is exactly what is happening to the &quot;donation box&quot; located at Northern and 86th Street and the side of Compare super market. It has become one big garbage dump. I hope that after I complain to Danny Dromm&#039;s office....and I now I will make a complaint... that they remove it as well.....although I wont be shopping there either way.

The issue of trash piles developing outside the bins seems to be a pretty common phenomenon.&nbsp; The photo below is from an urban planning forum.&nbsp; They also provided a link to sample legislation &nbsp;(http://www.generalcode.com//codification/sample-legislation/donation-bins#samp1) (below) for clothing drop boxes.<br /><br /><strong>Donation bins</strong> are large metal containers placed in outdoor public locations for people to drop off used clothing for charitable purposes. More and more communities are adopting regulations to ensure that proceeds are used to benefit charitable organizations, and preventing commercial enterprises from using clothing donation bins for profit. Bins must contain the identification of the organization responsible for the bin, along with a phone number and address. The organization must also empty the bin regularly to prevent clothing being strewn about the area. Regulations limit the size of the bin; number of bins per location; placement, including maintaining clear sight triangles, circulation, setbacks, parking and driveways. Bins should be designed to prohibit the entry of nonauthorized persons. Donation bins are generally prohibited on residential property and in residential districts.<br /><br /><br />(http://www.cyburbia.org/gallery/data/504/clothing_bins.jpg)

				I thought this got addressed really quickly (2 weeks) and the reactions here were definitely overblown considering Lemon Farm had barely been made aware it was even an issue. <br /><br />My impression is that the store owner is also a victim (for lack of a better word) here. &nbsp;The very first post notes that it wasn&#039;t the owner that was initially made aware it was an issue. &nbsp;I never expect that bitching to a minimum wage employee is going to yield results except for them steering clear of me next time they see me.<br /><br />It was 7 posts until someone confirmed having had made contact with the owner and that he was unaware until that point, this was after 4 people were already on the boycott bandwagon. &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure the pitch the owner received regarding the box was that its a good cause and one could easily forgive him for thinking it was a good idea for the store and neighborhood (someone even posted info regarding that it is known for &quot;duping&quot; store owners). &nbsp; I expect him to be an expert in stocking cheeses and produce, not obscure scams.&nbsp; &nbsp;Its not like it can disappear in a day and I&#039;m sure the box owner didn&#039;t make it easy to get it removed, I would have easily estimated 30 days to get it fully addressed. &nbsp;<br /><br />I am glad the box is gone but I think giving the store owner a chance to &quot;cure&quot; before starting an online uproar and calling for a boycott would have been only reasonable. &nbsp;A reactionary call to arms before a real conversation has been had is just ridiculous and unrealistic especially for something that was so obviously not an intentional affront to the neighborhood.

				Ii don&#039;t think the reactions were overblown. The business owner was getting a &quot;rent check&quot; for the use of his sidewalk space as is so common on 37 ave,&nbsp; and must have known that it was illegal.&nbsp; That being said,&nbsp; the JHBG&nbsp; had to fight&nbsp; so hard to have&nbsp; Time Warner Cable remove their ugly green cable boxes&nbsp; from our sidewalks a decade ago. I&#039;m sure the Newbies to the neighborhood&nbsp; aren&#039;t even aware of that controversy since it was well before this site was created. So we&#039;ve been there, done that , so to speak. Thank You Jackson Heights residents for righting a wrong. That&#039;s what makes this neighborhood so un-trendy and special :)
