				I have noticed that there are a lot of careless dog owners who do not pickup after their dogs. Part of the problem is that not every building has a garbage can outside. I have to plan my dog walks to end near one of the few garbage cans around my Coop. I don&#039;t feel that a garbage can distracts from the aesthetic of the building and might also help with the massive littering problem.

				I&#039;ve noticed that there are a few dog owners who seem to like walking their dogs off leash.&nbsp; This really peeves me!&nbsp; &nbsp;:tickedoff:&nbsp; Not only is it dangerous for the dog, but while the owner is chatting away on his/her cell phone, they&#039;re not paying attention to the fact that their dog has pooped.&nbsp; Hence, no clean-up.&nbsp; On a few sleepless nights, as I&#039;ve looked out my window, I&#039;ve also noticed that there are a few people that walk their dogs in the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp; At least 3 that I&#039;ve seen so far don&#039;t pick-up.

				Don&#039;t know why some dog owners don&#039;t pick up. I think some people just don&#039;t get(and don&#039;t care) that its&nbsp; illegal to not pick up after their dogs. Although that would beg the question: has anyone ever seen someone get a ticket from a police officer for NOT picking up after their pooch? Seems if the law was more enforced the problem would be (pardon the pun) eliminated.

				&nbsp;:tickedoff: So I go out tonight to be greeted by this HUGE pile in front of our building. :tickedoff:&nbsp; This really ticks me off.&nbsp; Each time it rains, the rain seems to wash away many of the messes, but as soon as the rain stops, new piles appear.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even imagine that most of these inconsiderate acts are committed by dogs owned by neighborhood residents.&nbsp; I know there are two or three that are indeed guilty of not cleaning up because I&#039;ve managed to catch them in the act.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; What can be done short of asking them to clean up after their dogs?&nbsp; Are we supposed to threaten people, call a cop?&nbsp; What do we do?&nbsp; There are days when I&#039;m afraid to walk down the street without having to examine the sidewalk carefully for fear of stepping into a mess.&nbsp; Or else there&#039;s the tracked mess that&#039;s already been created by some poor soul with dirty shoes.<br /><br />Has anyone approached a non-picker-upper, and if so, what feedback have you gotten besides the usual &quot;mind your own business&quot; comment?

				Honestly, I don&#039;t know if much people have noticed but some buildings around the neighborhood at times smell like dog urine. I think people should do something about lazy walkers that just walk there dogs out of the building and let them pee near there building which in the end usually during the summer creates and unbearable stench.

				Offering a bag to some one who has not cleaned up has worked for me.&nbsp; A bigger problem for me has been last Thursday evening my small dog was threatened by a young male with his pitbull.&nbsp; As we walked by he gave a command to his dog who began to growl and strain at the lead.&nbsp; Then he said &quot;no&quot; and the dog stopped.&nbsp; He did this two more times as we walked by.&nbsp; This happened in front of the building on the north side of 35 Ave between 85th St and 84th St.&nbsp; I called 911 but by the time I recieve a response from the police it was an hour later...of course this guy and his dog was long gone.&nbsp; I cannot help but believe that there must be dog fighting some where in the JH area.

				I agree BG.<br /><br />I walk my dog. He does his business, then I go walk to a garbage can.<br />Sometimes I even have to walk an extra block or two to get to a garbage can.<br />It&#039;s not that difficult.<br /><br />But then again, the people who don&#039;t pick up after their dogs are the ones who are lazy enough to not want to walk the extra block to a garbage can. There&#039;s a lady who lives on 35th and 77th that walks out with her white poodle every day and NEVER picks up. It&#039;s very annoying.<br /><br />Adding garbage can&#039;s to every other block on 35th and 34th Avenue would definitely be a good idea.

				A friend of mine, also a dog owner, was frustrated by the lack of garbage cans on 34th and 35th aves. He called the sanitation department and requested a can be placed on 82nd St. and 35th ave. within a week, one was there. However, a week later it was gone. He called DOS and they replaced the can, yet a week later it was gone. He called one more time and was told the can would be replaced. A week later he received a call from sanitation and was informed that they would not place the can there any more. <br /><br />it seems that in residential sections of neighborhoods like ours sanitation limits the amount of garbage cans because people wind up using the cans for residential garbage. Because of this, the cans fill up very fast and over flow creating an even worse litter problem on the street. <br /><br />Sometimes, you just can&#039;t win.

				There was a news story a few days ago about how the NYC Sanitation Department will start coming down hard on dog owners that don&#039;t abide by the City&#039;s pooper scooper laws.&nbsp; People walking unleashed dogs may also take their hits, and rightfully so.<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/05/05/2008-05-05_pet_owners_scoop_up_fines_for_not_doing_.html<br /><br />Re:&nbsp; garbage cans on the Avenues -- there was a time a few years back when 35th and 34th Avenues did have garbage cans present on a few corners. Unfortunately, some cans that were not chained to lamp posts were stolen overnight.&nbsp; Others were filled to the brim creating an eyesore and encouraging the presence of vermin.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve spoken to the police in reference to people littering on the street and their reply is that it&#039;s the sanitation department that tickets people who litter.&nbsp; So the police walking around are not responsible for those kind of tickets which I&#039;m sure the dog poop falls under that category.

				Exactly Todd.&nbsp; I read the article and there aren&#039;t enough sanitation patrollers and they can&#039;t force people to show ID and basically it&#039;s a &quot;lost&quot; in the words of the sanitation employee being interviewed.<br /><br />The City could make a lot of revenue when you consider $200 for off leash and $250 for not picking up after your dog.&nbsp; Even parking tickets aren&#039;t that high in most places.<br /><br />Talk about &quot;lost&quot; as in cha ching!

				In defense of my proposal, it doesn&#039;t have to be too unpleasant for the dog.&nbsp; Spot could be spent to a fun, high-end doggie spa/day care facility in Manhattan or the Hamptons, and the owner forced to pay the bill to get Spot out of hock.<br /><br />Perhaps I&#039;m onto something here...&nbsp; Cars with noisy alarms could be towed to garages that pull out the alarms, install state-of-the-art emissions controls, and perhaps add some nice detailing as well.&nbsp; Again, you gotta pay up if you want your car back!<br /><br />

				The New York City Department of Sanitation is in charge of enforcing the Pooper Scoop law.&nbsp; According to the following information from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 311 is the number to call with complaints.<br /><br />Veterinary Public Health Services Animal Law Enforcement/Nuisance Complaint (http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/vet/vet4.shtml)<br /><em><strong><br />&quot;New York City has many laws that apply to the keeping of animals, some of which carry fines of up to $2,000 per violation. Some of the regulations pertaining to animals are the Dog License Law, the Dog Leash Law, the Canine Waste Law (Pooper Scoop&quot;), the Rabies Vaccination Law and the Animal Nuisance Law. VPHS works with the Police, the Parks Department, the Sanitation Department and other agencies to enforce these regulations. DOH will take complaints concerning the presence of animals or will refer you to the appropriate agency. To make a complaint call DOHMH Central Complaints at 311.

				My block I feel is really bad with the dog poop.&nbsp; i&#039;m on 78th st between roosevelt and 37th ave.<br /><br />Seriously I&#039;ve never seen any neighborhood with such a major dog poop problem as Jackson Heights and that&#039;s really sad.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also confronted lazy poopers and would you believe it?&nbsp; Their whole family poured out of the building and treated me like I was the a-hole!<br /><br />argh....&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s ridiculous though that sanitation has to be the one to enforce the law and not the police.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways I&#039;d love to join someone on some rounds to look for lazy poopers and I&#039;d recommend that we both bring a camera to catch them in the act and post the pictures up on this board!&nbsp; Better yet... how about some video?<br /><br />

				In the 70&#039;s I had a Boxer when the law was passed in New York in which you had to clean up after your dog.&nbsp; I always carried newspapers with me to slip under his behind after he stopped going around in circles knowing he was about to go.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the easiest solution since he was a large dog that ate alot.&nbsp; My father bought a pooper scooper and since I was the one that actually took the Boxer out everyday, I told him that the scooper was too small for Toro&#039;s poop and that he would need more like a Shovel and a Radio Flyer Wagon.

				I would suggest you contact either the board or your management agency and ask if a sign could be posted in the elevators and by the mail boxes asking for all dog owners to curb their dogs and mention the garden is off limits.&nbsp; That way the senior tenants will be aware that they are being watched................

				There&#039;s really no excuse for not cleaning after your dog.&nbsp; Honestly a lot of people in JH don&#039;t think they should have to bother. (that goes for garbage too!)&nbsp; I walk my dog three-four times a day for long walks.&nbsp; When he poops, we put a newspaper under his behind so he doesn&#039;t mess up the sidewalk.&nbsp; Pick it up, fold and carry to the nearest can or home if necessary. (You never have to touch it either) I know where the cans are, they are out there, you might have to walk a few blocks.&nbsp; But even if you pick it up in a bag, the responsibility issue doesn&#039;t change. Why does not having a garbage can every block matter?&nbsp; If your dog messes, clean it up.<br />It&#039;s what being a responsible dog owner, indeed a responsible person (and neighbor) is about.&nbsp; Anyone who doesn&#039;t do it is selfish and bad neighbor. Period.&nbsp; There are no excuses.

				With a significant amount of snow in our forecast for this weekend, I&#039;m reminding all (especially lurkers out there) to please clean up after your dogs.&nbsp; Melting snow and dog poop are pretty gross, so let&#039;s keep the streets free and clear.&nbsp; Thanks!!

				Here&#039;s an interesting article from <strong>AMNY.com</strong> on how the number of poop-scoop fines issued over the past year have actually decreased in numbers.&nbsp; Some attribute this to the 2008 increase in the actual fine amount from $100 to $250.&nbsp; In other words, people may be respecting the pooper-scooper law for fear of having to pay the higher amount.&nbsp; Others don&#039;t see it that way because they claim to see no change or improvement on their neighborhood streets. <br /><br />The Sanitation Department crew in charge of issuing fines is very small.&nbsp; According to the article, it&#039;s only a crew of 24 people that cover the city in search of poop violators and other related K-9 violations.&nbsp; They claim that it&#039;s difficult to issue fines because people have to be caught in the act, and the only way they know of areas to patrol is via complaints that have been called into the city&#039;s 311 Hotline.&nbsp; Based on that, if there is a noticeable increase of complaints in a particular area, then the city sends out a crew member to patrol.<br /><br />Fewer fines poop-scoop fines for careless dog owners (http://amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/fewer-fines-poop-scoop-fines-for-careless-dog-owners-1.1760083)
