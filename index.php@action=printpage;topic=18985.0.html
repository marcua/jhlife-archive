				UPDATE:<br /><br />The weather will be perfect tomorrow, Saturday, for the Garden Tour, so please come!&nbsp; 15 Gardens will be participating - From Linden Court on 84th Street to Washington Plaza on 74th Street.&nbsp; <br /><br />Garden Tour tickets available at the Community Church beginning at 10am tomorrow.&nbsp; Espresso 77 should have them as well, for those who want to buy tickets in advance.<br /><br />I believe there may only be a few walking tour tickets left.&nbsp; Since just two tours will head out at noon, we have limited the number of tickets to 60.&nbsp; If someone wants to volunteer to be a tour guide in 2020, let the JHBG know.<br /><br />Thanks!

				&nbsp;Absolutely gorgeous weekend for the Historic Tours. Roses are stupendous this year which might<br />be a present from all the rain. Thanks to Michele Boudain (sp?) for the gelatos which were so <br />tasty. And of course, to Dan K. for being a super hero of Jackson Heights.
