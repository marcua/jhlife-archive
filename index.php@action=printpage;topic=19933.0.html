				Today while I was on a return leg of long walk to Steinway Street along 34th Avenue I saw The Naked Cowboy who was standing on the corner of I think 72nd and 34th. He was in his regular jockey shorts with Naked Cowboy on his rear, white guitar, and&nbsp; multiple Trump 2020 signs on his front. He was chatting affably with a couple and I thought I heard him say he would be back next week. So was this some kind of performance art, a paid political event or simply the Cowboy defying the odds of finding Trump voters in this the bluest of blue strongholds of anti-Trump feeling. Does anyone know?

				&nbsp;Oh yes! He was here on that corner and we took a photo from the car but unfortunately some one stepped in front of him at the wrong moment so you can only see a slice of him from the side. It was a sight right there on 34th Ave.

				Nope, it wasn’t me. But justice this will prevail. Maybe that was the point he was trying to make?

				I have been told by several people The Naked Cowboy stops into the Legends several times a year.&nbsp; Maybe he has family or friends who live in JH.<br /><br />

				judging from some of the remarks i&#039;ve heard out of the mouths of Legends customers, i&#039;m sure a trump supporter would easily find a home at a booth or at the bar there.

				There’s plenty of online info stating that the Naked Cowboy resides in Woodside, Queens. Someone I know also spotted him on 34th Ave yesterday. She says he lives in Jackson Heights, so maybe he lives somewhere on the borderline of the two neighborhoods.&nbsp; ???
