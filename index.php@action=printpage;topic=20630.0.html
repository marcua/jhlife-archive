				This came up on a JH Facebook page and makes some sense. In other neighborhoods OS is on commercial streets not residential ones. Could be good opportunity to get some new blood in stores and restaurants. Do we really need another pharmacy? Bikes, kids and pedestrians could take over the wide street and better built restaurant shacks could go up and not have to worry about a car running into them (as has happened on Roosevelt Ave.) Anyone else like this idea and want to help&nbsp; make it a reality. For the record I do not live on 34th Ave. nor do I own a car so forget thinking I have an agenda.<br />

				businesses on 37th demand all-day access to deliveries, which means all-day double parking of 18-wheelers and cargo vans. i don&#039;t think residents of side streets want those trucks double parked at their homes, so...

				And yet it works in other neighborhoods. I could be wrong but seems to me most big truck store deliveries are done in the early morning, like before 10.<br /><br />

				I think 37th was originally intended to be opened.&nbsp; If I recall correctly it was going to be on Sundays only.&nbsp; I think they made a half-hearted attempt at it once and then it was promptly forgotten.&nbsp;

				The businesses would probably fight this tooth and nail, there&#039;s a lot of out of town people that drive in to go to the places in the low 70s. The main reason for all the double parking nonsense.

				There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of opening up a commercial street. It&#039;s just a very different kind of open street. 34th Avenue, with all its trees and character, as well as proximity to many schools, is good for a Open Street with a focus on recreation and relaxation. 37th Avenue would be a good option for an OS that is focused on capitalism.&nbsp; The community seems to prefer an OS with a focus on recreation and relaxation.
