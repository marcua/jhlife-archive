					Friends, neighbors and supporters:<br />&nbsp;<br />We are excited to announce a rare opportunity to support a treasured Jackson Heights asset.<br />&nbsp;<br />With spring finally here to stay, the Jackson Heights Green Alliance has begun planning for the summer 2012 Play Street on 78th Street, when we will again close the street to traffic and provide enhanced opportunities for recreation and entertainment all summer long.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, we need your help to fund these efforts and are excited to announce that our friends at <a href="http://ioby.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">ioby.org</a> have come up with a great way to stretch your contributions -- <strong>a special matching campaign beginning on Sunday, April 22.<br />&nbsp;</strong><br />As part of ioby&#039;s 2nd annual Earth Day Match Campaign, all contributions to the Play Street through ioby.org starting at 9am EST on Sunday, April 22nd (Earth Day) will be matched dollar-for-dollar up to $22. <em>In other words, a $78 donation will mean $100 for the Play Street!</em><br />&nbsp;<br />The folks at ioby.org have committed $10,000 to this match campaign, but we are competing with all of the other projects on the site, and when the $10,000 is gone, itâ€™s gone.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, please, if you value the extra open space and the programming offered at 78th Street Play Street, tape a note to your refrigerator and make a donation of $22 (or more!) on Sunday morning, April 22.<br />&nbsp;<br />The project link can be found at:<br /><a href="https://ioby.org/project/jackson-heights-78th-street-play-street-2012" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://ioby.org/project/jackson-heights-78th-street-play-street-2012</a><br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you for your continued support.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Your friends at the Jackson Heights Green Alliance</strong>

					<div align="center"><img src="http://jhgreen.org/images/play-street-logo.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /></div><br />Hi, the 78th Street Play Street needs some help! There are several ways you can pitch in.<br /><br /><strong>KICK-OFF EVENT</strong>: One great way to help is by attending our big kick-off event on Thursday July 1st at 5pm! We&#039;re hoping to have live music and a bouncy castle for the kids. Bring your children, friends, family and neighbors! The more people who attend and show their support, the greater the likelihood of this becoming a permanent feature of Jackson Heights. There will be many elected officials and representatives from various city agencies present. Let&#039;s show them how much the Play Street means to Jackson Heights!<br /><br /><strong>ASTRO TURF</strong>: On either Sunday the 27th or Monday the 28th I (Dudley) will be taking a truck to pick up some AstroTurf for the street. This is important because it could make a HUGE difference in how the street looks and how it is used. It&#039;s about an hour away, I need some people to come with me to pick it up and then bring it to the street. It&#039;s VERY HEAVY stuff so please be aware of that before signing up!<br /><br />If you think you could help on either one of those days, please send me an email to <a href="mailto:dudley@jhgreen.org" class="bbc_email">dudley@jhgreen.org</a> and let me know what day and times work for you and I&#039;ll get back to you right away. This is quite urgent, so please help if you have the time!<br /><br /><strong>FILLING PLANTERS</strong>: The Dept of Transportation will provide a number of large planters to serve as traffic safety barriers. We need to fill them with soil and plants. They will arrive at approximately 7am on July 1. We need a handful of people to help shovel the soil into the planters that morning -- this should take a couple of hours. We will supply shovels and wheelbarrow. Please email us at <a href="mailto:volunteer@jhgreen.org " class="bbc_email">volunteer@jhgreen.org </a>or just show up if you can help.<br /><br /><strong>CLEARING OUT STORAGE</strong>: In the past we used Donnelly Gardens to store our sports equipment and art supplies but we&#039;ll be moving that to an outdoor storage box for the launch. This means we need to clean out the storage room at Donnelly. It&#039;s not a big job but we need a couple of people to help with it. It shouldn&#039;t take more than an hour or two. If you can help with this, please let us know at <a href="mailto:volunteer@jhgreen.org" class="bbc_email">volunteer@jhgreen.org</a><br /><br /><strong>STREET CAPTAINS</strong>: If you can help supervise the Play Street this first week of operation (July 1st to 7th) please send an email to <a href="mailto:volunteer@jhgreen.org" class="bbc_email">volunteer@jhgreen.org</a> and we&#039;ll fill you in on how you could help.<br /><br />Thanks, and see you on <strong>July 1st at 5pm</strong>!<br /><br />Jackson Heights Green Alliance

					Hello! The good weather is coming and our poor, park-deprived neighborhood needs help. We are applying for the Play Street again this year, to run every Sunday from June 1st to October 31st. <br /><br />There is something different happening this year; an initiative spearheaded by our new City Councilman Danny Dromm and his staff. We are applying to keep the Play Street going for the entire months of July and August, Mondays to Sundays! We need some help though.<br /><br />Primarily, we need our petition signed by you. The more signatures we get in favor of this, the greater the likelihood of it actually happening.<br /><br />If you&#039;re not sure what the Play Street is, here&#039;s a brief explanation:<br /><br />For the past two years, a coalition of neighborhood groups aided by many volunteers have closed 78th Street between 34th and Northern to traffic on every Sunday during the Summer. This relieves some of the congestion in Travers Park and opens up the street for all sorts of activities. More information can be found on <a href="http://www.jhgreen.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhgreen.org </a><br /><br />You can find our petition in Espresso 77 (77th, just north of 37th) - if you&#039;re in the mood for a coffee please sign it there, and in Table Wine (37th between 79th and 80th) if you&#039;re hankering for some great wines and interesting liquors. <br /><br />It would be even better if you were to print the petition yourselves, sign it, get your friends and neighbors to sign it and hand it in to either of those places.<br /><br />The petition can be found here: <a href="http://www.jhgreen.org/docs/Summer-Playstreet-signature-page-(2010).pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jhgreen.org/docs/Summer-Playstreet-signature-page-(2010).pdf </a><br /><br />Thanks very much, let me know if you have any questions!<br /><br />Dudley

					<strong>The 78th Street Play Street strategy for 2009/2010.</strong><br /><br />After a very successful closing of 78th Street on Sundays during Summer/Fall of 2008 we have regrouped and started weighing our options for the future. <br /><br />Our eventual goal is to make 78th Street a permanently closed street which would become part of Travers Park. It would act as an expansion to the park. <br /><br />Our immediate goal is to see how closing the street for a longer period would improve the community, so in order to achieve this we are considering its closure for the entirety of the Summer in 2009. This would coincide with the NY schools Summer vacation dates.<br /><br />Many of you responded to our request for comments on last year&#039;s Play Street and the comments were all extremely positive. Now we are reaching out again to hear your thoughts on the plan we are proposing. <br /><br />To this end, please come for a meeting on April 7th at 8pm in the Diversity Center â€“ 76-11 37th Avenue.<br /><br />Your comments, thoughts and ideas are all very welcome, this is your community and your Play Street so please get as involved as you possibly can!<br /><br />JHGA <br /><br /><a href="http://www.jhgreen.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhgreen.org</a>

					Hello all! Recently, Helen Sears and the Parks Department met with the Community Board&#039;s Parks &amp; Recreation Committee to present some changes they want to make in Travers Park. Also present at the meeting were representatives of Friends of Travers Park and JH Green.<br /><br />This Thursday the Parks &amp; Recreation Committee will be meeting and while the issue of the proposed improvements probably didn&#039;t make it on the Agenda for this particular meeting it can be brought up once the Agenda items have been dealt with. These meetings are open to the public. The Thursday meeting is at 6 PM in the CB#3 District Office (82-11 37th Av Suite 606).<br /><br />Following is a list of the improvements that the Parks Dept. wants to make to Travers Park:<br /><br />- Replace the play equipment in the older kids play area with new equipment that will accommodate more children and present greater challenges for them<br />- Replace the water sprinklers to improve the current ones and add some toddler-friendly ones<br />- Add a sandpit to the smaller kids play area<br />- Remove the headless turtle<br />- Install an arch at the side entrances to the park saying &quot;Welcome to Travers Playground&quot;<br />- The chess tables near the ball fields will be removed because the new play equipment will have a larger footprint<br />- The benches for the tennis court will be along the fence on the 78th street side<br />- Extend the waterline to reach the athletic field plantings for watering purposes<br />- Change the watering access point to make them easier to use<br /><br />This would most likely take place over Winter-Spring of 2009 if all goes ahead as planned.<br /><br />During some discussion after the event the one item that most people didn&#039;t want was the sandbox because of several issues (taking up valuable running/walking space, cleanliness, potentially hazardous).<br /><br />Another issue was a request for a safe surface for the sprinklers area other than concrete. The Parks Department said they researched this and couldn&#039;t find a good alternative, some research we did indicates otherwise although it might prove costly. I still want to look further into this when I get the time.<br /><br />If you have any suggestions or comments you&#039;d like to make about all of this please respond here or come to the meeting on Thursday, all thoughts are welcome.<br /><br />Helen Sears made it quite clear that there&#039;s not going to be much money coming into the park in the future which makes it difficult to contest any of the proposed improvements but the community should certainly have a say in what gets done, and where. This is why I&#039;m posting this, since as residents of J-High we use the park more than most people we have a better idea of what&#039;s really needed, plus I think it&#039;s good for everybody to be informed of what&#039;s being planned.<br /><br />Dudley
