				the store has an excellent selection, but they&#039;ve grown increasingly &quot;careless&quot; about fresh dates. the nuts and dried fruits are sometimes three and four months past the sell-by dates, and i&#039;ve had to return cheese and meat on more than one occasion after forgetting to check.

				<em>&quot;nuts and dried fruits are sometimes three and four months past the sell-by dates&quot;</em><br /><br />Idunno, I wouldn&#039;t judge too harshly on this issue cuz I believe many stores simply change the lid/container to offer a new sell-by date. <br /><br />And you never know how old something is before it is packaged at the store level. <br /><br />If it&#039;s really not edible, return it. Make sure you get a receipt. <br /><br />I don&#039;t trust stores that don&#039;t provide--without asking for--a receipt.<br /><br />Lemon Farm is decent enough for me. Maybe I have lower standards!

I was concerned that was a sign that they couldn&#039;t afford to remove it from the shelves and they were not selling enough product. I got used to checking the date on everything i pulled off a shelf due to that. I mean realistically things like Yogurt and Eggs are still good well past the date.<br /><br />They have a great selection of things otherwise and I went there all the time regardless. It would be a shame for it to disappear. :(

				Yes the Lemon Farms on the corner of 78 Street and 37th&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any details other than the new owners are already there and John and Adam are gone and left their cat Cookie there too.&nbsp; Apparently not even the cashier knew about the sale until it was a done deal.

				&nbsp; We grew to like shopping here very much over time. BUT- the design of the store inside is not good.Thing are hard to see and find as some items were in obscure places. I would recommend redoing the whole interior design and putting a cashier in the very front with some space for lines and wide enough aisles to carry a cart on your arm as you shop. Selection is v.good though and we often make it a destination for shopping.<br />

				Agreed! Lemon Farm is unique to the neighborhood, offering a wide selection of goods not available anywhere else in JH. I hope the new owners will retain the same concept, while making improvements as needed.

				I&#039;ve been in a few times since it has changed hands and it already feels as though it&#039;s changing for the worst. Tonight they tried to over charge me by about $5. I started to add things up on my phone and the cashier suddenly agreed to re-ring everything. When she gave me my receipt, I noticed that it wasn&#039;t itemized.<br /><br />Other things:<br /><br />1. The new employees (or owners?) can be quite mean. I went in once for coffee and the person behind the counter barked &quot;WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!&quot; She seemed annoyed that I was buying coffee. I used to have conversations with the old cashiers. They were quite friendly.<br /><br />2. They don&#039;t seem to restock some of the specialty items that I occasionally buy there or even the chicken stock that I like, which I bought regularly. I haven&#039;t seen the good baguette that they used to sell for a while (can&#039;t remember who makes it), and their pasta selection seems to be dwindling.<br /><br />3. The music is a drag.

				I don&#039;t buy very much at Lemon Tree although I&nbsp; frequently stop by for odds and ends. I agree that the new ownership seem not to be making much of an effort to engage with their customers. Certainly the young women who had been there a few weeks ago seemed much friendlier than the present group who seem to make very little effort to develop a positive presence. Given the competition in the neighborhood that attitude comes with a price.

				I just got back from Lemon Farm, and thought I&#039;d float this topic up to the top of the chat. I&#039;m so disappointed to see that the place has gone downhill since transitioning to the new owners. The range of products has decreased considerably -- today, there were shelves full of the same product (vinegar, jam); the products that they still carry are quite typical, and not the interesting selection that they had before or that Parrot Cafe has; and prices are overall higher than before (aside from fruit and veggies). <br /><br />Curious if you noticed the changes too?

				Lemon Farm is definitely worse now. Friendly Colombian girl with glasses who I used to chat with seems to not work there anymore. Korean lady frequently overcharges me and acts rude all the time. Yogurts are often expired nowadays. Fewer distinctive spreads and spices from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. More bugs in produce. Still decent breads, olive oils, etc. but not the same and a real loss.0

				Funny thing happened to me few times already. My receipt was let&#039;s say $5.02 cents, or $8.01 and overtime they take $6 or $9 and give me back 98 or 99 cents.

				I think what we&#039;re saying is that the vibe of the place has changed. It used to feel like a neighborhood place, where the staff knew the customers, where a penny could be owed/borrowed, and where the selection was constantly growing and tailored to the clientele, whereas now it&#039;s just a transactional point. My biggest beef is with the selection, which has declined sharply (maybe not so for fruit and vegetables). There literally are shelves of Bon Maman jams, vinegar and Hellman&#039;s mayo.
