				Good question.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t see why they would be against it.&nbsp; They allow all the vendors with food carts and tables selling trinkets on the sidewalk.&nbsp; You would also need a very large frontage or a corner site which has the wide sidewalks on both sides of the restaurant.<br /><br />What type of food would your restaurant serve?

				I&#039;m not against outdoor seating, but it seems to me that the sidewalks here are rather narrow.&nbsp; I can&#039;t stand it when I&#039;m walking down the street and have no place to move and am forced into the street.&nbsp; Another thing that throws me is the many paper distributors ( I don&#039;t know what to call them--The metal boxes that have all sorts of news papers in them).&nbsp; &nbsp; There are about three or four on almost every corner. The feel is that of congestion&nbsp; Out door sidewalk seating needs to also have some&nbsp; green I would think. I can&#039;t imagine sitting on Northern Blvd or 37Th Ave. for that matter.&nbsp; It is visually unappealing to me.&nbsp; If you&#039;d find a place with a garden,&nbsp; then that&#039;s a whole other story. A corner location where you would have a side street might work&nbsp; a hell of alot better then the Avenues.

				Marcelo, you can read more on this topic at the following thread:<br /><br />Outdoor Dining (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=769.0)<br /><br />In the meantime, it would be interesting to see the results for the poll that you&#039;ve created.

				Tonight I was having a margarita at LAS MARGARITAS (AKA:&nbsp; Texas something or other on 84th and 37th).&nbsp; I was wondering the same thing about sidewalk seating.&nbsp; I for one would LOVE it....&nbsp; Would prefer sitting outdoors on 37th as opposed to Northern...&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				I think that the concern is foot traffic on the sidewalks.&nbsp; But I can&#039;t imagine anything that I would enjoy more than sitting out on the Ave with a nice drink or a bite to eat (and the baby in the high chair, of course) and watching the world go by.&nbsp; <br /><br />Long-time residents... what do you think?&nbsp; Am I crazy, or does it seem like there is less foot traffic on 37th ave than there used to be?<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about this a lot.&nbsp; I walk up and down 37th at least twice a day to go to work, and often a couple of times more to do errands.&nbsp; It really seems like there used to be shoulder to shoulder foot traffic.&nbsp; Are more driving residents moving in, and hopping into the car to go to Trader Joe&#039;s rather than carrying bags of veggies from the fruit stands?

				It&#039;s funny that you say that KC. I was also just thinking about foot traffic, but my observation is the opposite.&nbsp; I&#039;d love an outdoor cafe too,&nbsp; but feel it it sooooooooo conjested.&nbsp; I find this to be particularly true from 82nd strreet and above. On a Saturday or Sunday afternoon it&#039;s hard to walk down the block without literally bumping or brushing into someone.&nbsp; It seems in the city that there are a lot more people but you somehow feel it is more spacious.&nbsp;

				I also think foot traffic has gone up a bit in the low 70s. It&#039;s also a big stand-on-the-sidewalk-in-bunches-and-chat area so I can&#039;t imagine adding sidewalk seating to the mix.
