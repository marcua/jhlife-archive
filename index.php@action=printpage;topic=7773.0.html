				I&#039;m new to the neighborhood and New York in general. I learned today that liquor stores can&#039;t carry beer, for whatever reason. So, where are some good places to buy craft beer? FYI, I&#039;m at 73rd &amp; 35th.

				i know this sounds silly, but you should check out the met food on 37th and 76th. a goodly number of craft beers, including a lot of great IPAs.

				Trade Fair also used to have many though their selection has been dwindling lately. Still, they&#039;ve got some interesting brands.

				In the neighborhood, The Met on 37th definitely has the best selection. If you&#039;re willing to travel a little, Beer World in Sunnyside on Queens Blvd is amazing.<br /><br />http://thebeerventure.blogspot.com/2010/04/profile-beer-world-sunnyside.html<br /><br />And it&#039;s right near Salt and Fat! Yum!

				I checked out Beer World, nice selection but pretty pricey. They only sell by the bottle, a sample six-pack of Troegs (not available in Michigan) cost $16. I&#039;ll have to check out Met Food.

				Community Beverage isn&#039;t very conveniently located if you&#039;re in Jackson Heights, but they probably have a better craft beer selection than the grocery stores in the area. I&#039;ve only been once, and that was to fill up a growler, so I don&#039;t really know what their bottle and can selection is like. <br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/community-beverage-elmhurst

				i second (or is it third) the MET. &nbsp;surprisingly good selection as long as you aren&#039;t looking for something already cold. &nbsp;they have a lot of octoberfests and pumkin ales at the moment in addition to their normal variety.

				Picked up some Blue Point Oktoberfest and Six Point Righteous Ale at Met. It&#039;s surprising how weak the craft brew scene is in NYC, coming from a top 5 beer state in Michigan. I&#039;ll have to check out Community Beverage some time I&#039;m moving my car, stock up a little.<br /><br />Maybe there are other placea further from the city with a parking lot I can hit up with the car now and again?

				Community Beverage seems to keep its beermenus.com page up-to-date: http://www.beermenus.com/places/2035-community-beverage<br /><br />If you have a car, you should check out Fairway. I remember them having a large craft beer selection, but I don&#039;t know how their prices are. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how New York compares to Michigan, but there is definitely a craft brew scene. It&#039;s just concentrated in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

				Also, Mi Tierra on Northern and 80th has begun stocking some interesting beers, though the selection is small. We got a UFO pumpkin beer there, and it was really good.
