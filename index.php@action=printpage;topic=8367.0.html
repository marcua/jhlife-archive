				I went to PAK Halal gyro king when it was closed, but it said &quot;for renovations&quot;. I got the impression that it was for one day and voluntary; didn&#039;t see any department of heath postings. I&#039;ve probably had their chicken over rice a dozen times and never had any problems.

				I personally cannot patronize a restaurant that has been closed by the&nbsp; Board of Health.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think every restaurant will get a grade pending, or a B in the cycle of inspections, but to be closed, the owners are saying that they really DONT CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PATRONS THEY SERVE. If a restaurant is closed when a inspector comes in, can you imagine what is going on the other 364 days of the year?&nbsp; Halal park, Jackson diner, Afghan house have been closed MORE THAN ONCE.&nbsp; it&#039;s a loss for me, I used to love going out to these places. Since this has been made public on the D.O. H website, I have not eaten in any of them for years.....

				Sorry, I can&#039;t watch him for more than 30 seconds.&nbsp; Afghan was closed for Mice, Mice Droppings , Flies and a dozen other violations.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find that funny. It&#039;s so disrespectful, really.
