Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is under siege with three corporate development proposals that, if approved, will harm the park and potentially destroy its usefulness to the community as a public green space.

That is where you come in. <br /><br /><strong>We need you to come out on Monday, April 22nd at 7:30pm to the Queens Museum of Art for a community workshop on Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.

					<strong>Crains: Queens BPers oppose USTA</strong><br />by Chris Bragg<br /><br />Five of the candidates running for Queens borough president are against the United States Tennis Association&#039;s current expansion plan in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. On Friday morning, several of them blasted the proposed expansion at a press conference. The five candidates—ex-Councilwoman Melinda Katz, Councilman Leroy Comrie, state Sen. Tony Avella, state Sen. Jose Peralta and Councilman Peter Vallone Jr.—put their names to a statement blasting the USTA for not planning to replace 0.68 acres of parkland to become part of the tennis grounds. The borough president will issue an advisory opinion on the expansion during the city review process, although it is not clear if that will happen before or after the office changes hands in January.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130308/BLOGS04/130309861" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130308/BLOGS04/130309861</a><br />

					Queens Chronicle Editorial: <strong>Flushing Meadows soccer stadium must be stopped</strong><br /><br />Major League Soccer is doing its best to rush a misguided plan to build a stadium in Queens through all the hurdles it faces before Mayor Bloomberg leaves office. It cannot be allowed to succeed.<br /><br />League officials have been given every opportunity to be forthcoming about the important details of their proposal and to counter their critics, and they refuse to do so. A similar project they got approved in Harrison, NJ, just over the Hudson River, has failed to live up to its promises and ended up shorting that townâ€™s taxpayers at least $3.6 million.<br /><br />And, above all, their plan for a stadium in Flushing Meadows Corona Park would severely damage what remains the crown jewel of Queens, without enough benefit to residents.<br /><br />The deal MLS seeks with the city would be a steal, literally, in all but the legal sense. It wants a $1 a year lease for up to 13 acres of public parkland â€” the classic deal politicians and private for-profit businesses cook up behind closed doors to take the citizensâ€™ property without compensation.<br /><br />That deal, which must be stopped, is at the heart of why MLS is in such a rush. If it doesnâ€™t get public land essentially for free, the league will have to buy the 10 to 13 acres it needs for a 25,000 seat arena on the open market.<br /><br />All that the public would get in exchange is 13 acres of new parkland somewhere else â€”but not all in one chunk â€” and the rehab of some existing soccer fields at Flushing Meadows, which should be a city job anyway. MLS also says it would invest tens of millions of dollars in the park, but itâ€™s vague as to how and where, as it is on so many details, even when its president met with us last week.<br /><br />One of the most frustrating vagaries is the leagueâ€™s site selection process. MLS is dead set on building a stadium in Flushing Meadows, mostly because the land would be free but also because there are so many Latin Americans in nearby neighborhoods and soccer is such a force in that culture, and because of all the transportation options that get people to the park. But we donâ€™t see why a stadium couldnâ€™t be considered for any number of other locations, such as Aqueduct Race Track or the old Flushing Airport, and MLS has not been forthcoming in what other sites it rejected or why.<br /><br />We are not against soccer in Queens; in fact we would welcome it. We are against giving away our parkland. Imagine, as crazy as it sounds, that this project had been proposed for Central Park. Of course it would be rejected out of hand. But if the mayor wants a stadium, maybe he should consider putting it there, in his own neighborhoodâ€™s crown jewel park.<br /><br />Another major concern with the proposal is the question of team ownership, one of many issues discussed in this weekâ€™s Queens Chronicle story â€œMLS to Queens? Stop by Harrison, NJ first.â€ The league has yet to select an owner for the team it would locate here, but that means accountability would be hard to pursue should any problems arise as the stadium is built. And the one possible owner thatâ€™s been reported on in the press is an Arab oil sheik, a prospect we find troubling. If a Queens soccer team were to go belly up, as two MLS teams have in recent years, what would he care about an empty stadium nearly half a world away?<br /><br />Standard political practice means there is one person who could stop this project today if she wants to: City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras, whose district includes the northern section of the park. She should see this proposal for the land grab that it is. If she says no to it, the rest of the Council will follow suit, and the plan will be denied â€” if MLS doesnâ€™t just give up on its own first. We urge you to call Ferreras at (718) 651-1917 or (212) 788-6862, or email her at <a href="mailto:jferreras@council.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">jferreras@council.nyc.gov</a>, and tell her to keep our park in our hands. MLS can come back with a better site any time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/flushing-meadows-soccer-stadium-must-be-stopped/article_e233d216-4a31-5b54-aa1b-051b8c2233e5.html?TNNoMobile" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/flushing-meadows-soccer-stadium-must-be-stopped/article_e233d216-4a31-5b54-aa1b-051b8c2233e5.html?TNNoMobile</a>

					<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Queens Chronicle Editorial:<br />MLS stadium doesnâ€™t belong in our park</strong></span><br /><br />Soccer coaches often say controlling the ball and dictating the pace of play are integral to winning games. It appears Major League Soccer has adopted the same tactics when it comes to its proposed 25,000-seat stadium in the heart of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. This paper took a look at the leagueâ€™s initial proposal and gave it casual backing. No more.<br /><br />Simply put, we cannot understand why the league insists on setting up shop on public property, in a park utilized on any given weekend by thousands of borough residents. This atop a whole litany of lingering concerns.<br /><br />We are dismayed by a largely muddled outreach process embodied most recently by allegations of muted dissent at a â€œtown hall meetingâ€ on Tuesday. Our editor found troubling evidence the event was something more akin to a pep rally than an airing of ideas. A sign-in sheet was allegedly used to filter out the rabble. Pro-stadium groups were given an early invite and priority seating. And the theatrics of a crowd draped in MLS regalia and holding up pro-stadium poster boards was largely fabricated.<br /><br />Questions about the feasibility of building a stadium on a swamp will remain until MLS explains in detail how it will manage to build a stadium in an area where the water table is three feet below the surface at most, according to the 2006 U.S. Geological Survey map. Those concerns are only magnified by the proposed parking facility â€” not for public use â€” below the stadium, which we presume will be a wonder of water-repellent engineering.<br /><br />The league is also ignoring the lack of parking for fans, a problem anyone who frequents the park during the U.S. Open can attest to. While we respect MLSâ€™s traffic advisor, our own contributor Sam Schwartz, his projections that 50 percent of fans will take mass transit still leaves thousands of people driving to games. Where will they park?<br /><br />Most troubling is the still-unspecified replacement parkland, a major sticking point for many. Yes, the league is required to replace every inch of parkland, but there are no rules mandating it be in our borough. MLS is in the throes of a search, though that process has been closed to public input.<br /><br />Weâ€™re assuming the parkland it ultimately chooses will be safe, clean, close to a populace that will utilize it and accessible. So â€¦ why not build the darn stadium there?<br /><br />The leagueâ€™s argument that the worldâ€™s sport needs a home in the heart of our borough simply doesnâ€™t score many goals with us. We still donâ€™t have a complete list of other sites MLS was considering before it chose our park. Why not consider the myriad of pesky, unused sites around our borough, places that need an infusion of life and vitality? Something like the old Flushing Airport, Aqueduct Racetrack or the old home of the U.S. Open in Forest Hills?<br /><br />Weâ€™re left wondering how serious the league is about its repeated odes to collaboration and community input.<br />This is not a call to end all discussions of an MLS stadium in our borough. Far from it.<br /><br />The stadiumâ€™s estimated $60 million in annual economic activity, 150 permanent jobs and host of other economic benefits are nothing to overlook, in any economic climate.<br /><br />But the cost is too much. Itâ€™s a price that rejuvenated soccer fields, fixed fountains and an updated water management infrastructure cannot cover. Besides, donâ€™t we pay taxes so the Parks Department can handle those improvements? The cityâ€™s silence on this issue is deafening.<br /><br />Commissioner, youâ€™re a Queens guy. Câ€™mon. Itâ€™s our park. Itâ€™s yours too. Youâ€™re welcome to use it â€” like the rest of us.<br /><br />Itâ€™s time you and your league go back to a map and find another location.<br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/mls-stadium-doesn-t-belong-in-our-park/article_c3d92895-d251-54e8-b122-e6b39d4955b9.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/opinion/editorial/mls-stadium-doesn-t-belong-in-our-park/article_c3d92895-d251-54e8-b122-e6b39d4955b9.html</a>

					Development will damage Flushing Meadowsâ€™ role as marshy buffer against storm surge and coastal flooding<br />Natural protections need to be enhanced<br /><br />BY JASON MUNSHI-SOUTH / NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br /><br />MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2012, 4:00 AM<br /><img src="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1212054.1354501348!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/gst03q-2-web.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />The park acts as a natural sponge for tidal surges and stormwater runoff. It is a flood protection area â€” protecting our neighborhood (and basements) from serious flooding during big storms.<br /><br />Because Bloomberg understands climate change so well, it is baffling that his administration has signed on to development plans for Flushing Meadows that are alarming â€” the construction of new stadiums, roads, parking lots and a massive mall in the park.<br />These construction projects will substantially increase the percentage of impervious surface cover (materials that do not absorb water) in the park as green spaces are converted to structures (stadiums and malls) and concrete roads, parking lots and walkways. Any gains against pollution runoff and flooding in the Meadow and Willow Lake watershed will be damaged by these developments, and storm runoff into Flushing Bay will likely increase.<br /><br />Such development will also further damage Flushing Meadowsâ€™ historical role as a marshy buffer against storm surge and coastal flooding, placing residents and businesses located near Flushing Meadows in a more vulnerable position during extreme weather events. Do the developers of the soccer stadium have plans to address the potential damage from flooding to surrounding neighborhoods wrought by their work?<br /><br />Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is no stranger to bold plans that usher in major changes. However, these new developments resemble the worst excesses of Robert Moses rather than his success in originally creating the park. True boldness requires further protective wetland restoration in the park. In 2002, the Gaia Institute prepared a plan to connect Meadow and Willow Lakes, dramatically increase the amount of wetlands they contain, and bring stormwater drainage above ground as part of a restored marsh ecosystem, a approach called â€œdaylighting.â€<br />These changes would be a great start toward improving water quality, bringing nature recreation opportunities to underserved communities and protecting the park and surrounding areas from the impacts of severe weather.<br /><br />The continued suffering of our neighbors after Superstorm Sandy is the most visible illustration of just how deeply unwise it is to continue degrading coastal marsh areas like Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.<br /><br /><em><strong>Dr. Jason Munshi-South is an assistant professor of Environmental Science and Biology in the Department of Natural Science at Baruch College. As a resident of Jackson Heights, he enjoys frequent visits to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park with his wife and two children.</strong></em><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/flushing-meadows-plans-aren-sound-article-1.1212056#ixzz2E0Wd3qgB" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/flushing-meadows-plans-aren-sound-article-1.1212056#ixzz2E0Wd3qgB</a>

Their coaches and parents gathered on the sidelines, barking out instructions and chatting during breaks in play.<br /><br />â€œShe has soccer in her veins,â€ Estela Rincan said in Spanish, referring to her 10-year-old daughter, Daniela.<br /><br />Rincan, 54, brings Daniela to Flushing Meadows Park several times a week to play soccer on fields a stoneâ€™s throw away from the site of a proposed Major League Soccer stadium. The fields are heavily used by thousands of players in adult and youth leagues, including Metrokids, Danielaâ€™s league.<br /><br />The proposed stadium is causing controversy in the community, with many expressing concern that the project will harm the surrounding parkland, including the existing soccer fields. Major League Soccer has promised to replace and upgrade the fields, several of which are dilapidated. But the city Department of Parks and Recreation has already begun renovating four of the fields, according to a Parks spokesperson. Work is being done to one field at a time in order to minimize impact. The renovations, which are budgeted at $2.8 million, are expected to be completed by next June.<br /><br />â€œThe fields need to be repaired or they will be unsafe,â€ Risa Heller, the MLSâ€™s spokeswoman for the project, said via email. â€œWe are committed to repair them. They will be out of commission ... no longer than they would be if the City were to themselves conduct the repair. In sum, the fields will not be out of commission for any period of time due to [MLS].â€<br /><br />State Assemblyman Francisco Moya (D- Jackson Heights), who strongly supports the proposal, stressed MLSâ€™s promise to upgrade the fields. But he also acknowledged that they would probably be closed during the stadiumâ€™s construction, which he said is estimated to last about 13 months.<br /><br />That has caused concern among the parkâ€™s soccer players. Many people who played there as kids went on to receive soccer scholarships, said Romario Medinas, who runs a youth soccer clinic and coaches for Metrokids.<br />â€œThis issue of the stadium will affect where these kids end up,â€ Medinas, 46, said in Spanish. â€œThis is their second home. Where will they play?â€<br /><br />Donovan Finn, a professor of city planning at SUNY Stony Brook and a member of Community Board 3, said the promises of renovations donâ€™t matter.<br /><br />â€œ[MLS] has offered to relocate and renovate these fields but by the time the stadium is under construction that will be a hollow promise, as many of them will have been substantially renovated,â€ he said via email.<br /><br />More than 1,400 children play in Metrokids, which practices and plays only in Flushing Meadows Park, according to Felipe Russi, the leagueâ€™s general manager. That is in addition to dozens of teams in adult leagues.<br /><br />â€œThere are a lot of teams,â€ Eduardo Flores, who plays in an adult league, said in Spanish. â€œWhere are they going to move them?â€<br /><br />Many coaches, parents and players like the idea of a stadium, but only if it doesnâ€™t harm the fields. Flores, 28, is less ambivalent.<br /><br />â€œWe are athletes,â€ he said when asked if he would go to games in a new stadium. â€œWe donâ€™t come here to watch.â€<br />The stadium would occupy â€œno more than 13 acresâ€ of land within the park, according to an MLS spokesperson. The arena, which would come with a new team, still needs approval from the city and state, so a start date for construction has yet to be determined.<br /><br />The proposed site for the stadium is Industry Pond, a pool of water that used to house the Fountain of the Planets. The pool is slightly less than 9 acres large and is tightly encircled by four of the parkâ€™s soccer fields, which would fall partly within the footprint of a 13-acre stadium.<br /><br />And stronger opposition is burgeoning in the community. An audience of area residents booed loudly when the stadium was brought up for discussion during a public meeting held in Corona in early September to discuss the future of Flushing Meadows Park, and a coalition of groups aligned against the plan has been holding a series of meetings to rally opposition in nearby neighborhoods.<br /><br />â€œBut the important thing here to remember is not just how much land [Major League Soccer] wants, but how much land they will impact,â€ Finn said. â€œThey will need to build roads to access the stadium, they will need dropoff areas for delivery trucks, service vehicles and chartered buses.â€<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/pro-soccer-less-recreational-space/article_8d8e3a57-0b81-5e3f-a5b8-c02604404a04.html?TNNoMobile" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/pro-soccer-less-recreational-space/article_8d8e3a57-0b81-5e3f-a5b8-c02604404a04.html?TNNoMobile</a>

					It should be noted that the proponents of putting a soccer stadium and concert venue in the heart of Flushing Meadows Corona Park frequently cite the need for repairs to the community soccer fields as a rationale for development. Several of the nine soccer fields have fallen into disrepair because of mis-management and under-funding by NYC Parks Dept. Stadium proponents claim that the only way to improve the soccer fields is to allow Major League Soccer build a stadium/concert venue close by and in return, MLS will improve and maintain the fields.<br /><br />This is simply not true. The Parks Dept, as noted below by ABC News, is at the beginning of a major $2.8 million renovation of those soccer fields. By the time the capital improvements are finished, there won&#039;t be a need for MLS to &quot;save&quot; the park and the soccer fields. <br /><br />There are merits to the plan to bring a Major League Soccer to Queens. But I have deep concerns about the massively negative impact of putting a stadium in the very heart of the park. One of the great things about Flushing Meadows is that it is big enough that you and your family can safely run around, bike around, and walk leisurely without the fear of cars and traffic. <br /><br />If they build a stadium in the core of the park - it will bring cars, buses, parking lots, new roads, trucks, and pollution directly into the park. It will fundamentally transform our closest greenspace away from being a park and into a sports complex. Goodbye, Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Hello, Meadowlands. <br /><br />Can&#039;t we find a better location for this stadium? <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>ABC News: Repairs finally coming to Flushing soccer fields</strong></span><br /><br />For years, soccer players and coaches in Queens have had to deal with the poor conditions of the artificial turf fields in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.<br /><br />Now, some renovation work is under way. But many are asking what took so long?<br /><br />Back in 2002 and 2003, the city parks department replaced grass soccer fields with artificial turf, the idea being that turf was more durable and required less maintenance.<br /><br />Much needed repairs are finally under way on soccer fields 2, 3 and 5, with the turf being replaced at a cost of a $2.8 million.The turf is disintegrating so much that the recycled tires used for the rubber matting base is coming up like handfuls of sand.<br /><br />On field 5, there gaping holes in the turf, which is torn and comes up like a loose piece of carpet.<br /><br />But if you think this field goes unused because of the bad conditions, think again. Eyewitness News found kids practicing on the field.<br />Soccer organizations say the fields didn&#039;t get this bad overnight, but they&#039;ve been in bad shape for years.<br /><br />&quot;The thing is that you have to maintain it,&quot; said Luis Montoya, of Big Apple Youth Soccer. &quot;Since they made these fields, no one maintains them. They never did anything.&quot;<br /><br />One player said he twisted his ankle on field 5, and that other players have also had injuries.<br />&quot;<br />We just don&#039;t want to get hurt, our kids,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a kid. I don&#039;t want him to get hurt.&quot;<br /><br />NYC Park Advocates obtained an internal parks department memo dated September 27, 2006, when the fields were only a few years old. In it, field 2 is described as having torn and ripped turf with fiber disintegrating. It was called unrepairable and needed to be replaced.<br />It says on field 5, the rubber infill has washed away, and there is carpet wrinkling. The memo goes on to recommend complete replacement within a year.<br />&quot;<br />This is just, again, negligence,&quot; NYC Park Advocates&#039; Geoffrey Croft said. &quot;People complained about this for years, and you have to take care of things once you build them.&quot;<br /><br />While the parks department doesn&#039;t address why it took six years after the memo to replace the fields, they do say, &quot;Parks makes regular repairs to all of the synthetic turf fields at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. With the extraordinary use these fields receive - 12 or more hours each day for 12 months per year - it is difficult to keep any field, synthetic or grass, in top condition. These new fields are harder-wearing than the earlier synthetic turf fields, and we have found that they hold up much better to the rigors of play.&quot;<br /><br />The parks department also has plans to replace a fourth field, also in bad shape.<br /><br /><a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8816205" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8816205</a>

Finn called the land &quot;toxic,&quot; and a 2011 MTA presentation said that the land had &quot;poor soil conditions&quot; that would require remediation.<br /><br />The exact nature of the pollutants was not immediately clear, but the feds charged dozens of people more than a decade ago with dumping raw sewage and motor oil into the water.<br /><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121009/willets-point/toxic-site-eyed-as-replacement-parkland-mls-soccer-stadium-proposal#.UHQUb7PAfh4.twitter#ixzz28opMRFhb" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121009/willets-point/toxic-site-eyed-as-replacement-parkland-mls-soccer-stadium-proposal#.UHQUb7PAfh4.twitter#ixzz28opMRFhb</a>

You can chew away at its edges, as the city has tried with great vigor, encouraging the Metsâ€™ owners to construct a huge car-attracting mall on the northern edge of the park.<br /><br />And you can let sports franchises lay claim to its precious core. The Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations allowed the Yankees to build on a South Bronx park, with promises to replace the lost space. Now the Bloomberg administration appears to look favorably on Major League Soccerâ€™s proposalto place a 25,000-seat stadium smack in the middle of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.<br /><br />I wrote of this endangered Queens park last week.<br /><br />Major League Soccer has commissioned an architect to draw up pretty and crowd-pleasing drawings for the stadium. Already these plans have drawn cheers from some local politicians.<br /><br />The proposed stadium, however, has drawn vigorous opposition from residents in the immigrant-rich neighborhoods of Corona, Elmhurst, Flushing and Jackson Heights, who rely on this densely used park for a weekly dose of open green space.<br /><br />But the United States Tennis Association could prove the most intriguing and deep-pocketed opponent of the soccer stadium. Many local residents look with suspicion on the U.S.T.A., as it, too, plans to take another small bite out of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. It wants to build a new tennis facility and parking garages. (Officials note in their defense that more than half of the fans at the United States Open tournament arrive by mass transit.)<br /><br />This said, the tennis association often is a reasonable neighbor. When it cut a deal with the Dinkins administration to build a new facility in the early 1990s, it agreed to build dozens of tennis courts and let residents use them most weeks of the year.<br /><br />The tennis association also pays about $2.5 million a year to the city, although Bloomberg budget officials set aside no specific portion of that tithe for Flushing Meadows.<br /><br />Tennis officials view a soccer stadium with concern. Unlike Citi Field and the National Tennis Center, a soccer stadium in the middle of the park would sit a substantial distance from subways and trains. And it most likely would require more roads and parking, crossing close to the tennis center.<br /><br />And soccer officials have spoken of using the stadium for concerts, all of which would make it a cacophonous neighbor for the tennis complex.<br /><br />â€œIt raises a lot of concerns for us,â€ said Gordon Smith, executive director of the association. â€œWe ought to be considered in a very different light, because we raise almost none of those complications.â€<br /><br />For now, however, local residents offer the loudest opposition. With the help of organizations like Make the Road by Walking, Good Jobs New York and NYC Park Advocates, they have packed usually obscure and sparsely attended â€œscoping hearingsâ€ with hundreds of people to register their disapproval.<br /><br />The atmosphere at one such meeting last week fell well short of welcoming. While officials from the cityâ€™s Economic Development Corporation fiddled with their BlackBerrys and checked the time, the officials running the meeting did not offer simultaneous translation in Spanish, Bengali and Urdu to those who needed it. That omission runs counter to city guidelines.<br /><br />The city official who acted as the moderator of the hearing affected the condescension of an Eton headmaster. â€œI have been a college professor,â€ he informed the boisterous audience. â€œI will wait until you are silent.â€<br /><br />How very good of him.<br /><br />The Pratt Center for Community Development has issued a pointed new critique of the various plans for the park.<br /><br />To all of this, many of the cityâ€™s news media have contributed more than a little confusion of their own. A reporter for Gothamist, a news Web site, consistently frames the battle as one between small-minded NIMBYs and a terrific new stadium.<br /><br />Other reporters dismiss Industry Pond and the Fountain of Planets as a stagnant and â€œman-madeâ€ body of water that is â€œfenced offâ€ and sits in a remote corner of the park.<br /><br />These are curious bills of indictment. Nearly every lake in the city park system is man-made, and more than a few are fenced off. For instance, two of Prospect Parkâ€™s ponds are, unfortunately, fenced off, and no one has yet suggested paving those watery expanses. And the notion that the Flushing Meadows pond sits at a far remove from the park center is a fantasy. Visitors might discover this for themselves on any weekend by joining the crowds and food vendors congregating around the pond and soccer fields.<br /><br />A few years back, the Parks and Recreation Department offered its own strategic plan for Flushing Meadows, a visionary document that called for fewer cars and more natural areas, and for unshackling Industry Pond. The plan would rip up the asphalt, tear down the fences and create an open expanse of grass and water.<br /><br />The reportâ€™s language lacked eloquence, but its vision was expansive.<br /><br />Parks department officials so far have kept a careful silence on the new proposals. They perhaps face a choice of deferring to those who frame the future of the park in terms of revenue, or finding their own voice as guardians of this often neglected park.

					Taggie - <br /><br />I agree that the soccer stadium has its merits. I have heard numerous people propose what I think is a sensible solution: Move the Soccer Stadium to the CitiField parking lot (which is where the Mall is proposed for). If the Mets feel like they don&#039;t need their parking lot anymore, then that is the ideal place for a soccer stadium. It would be closer to mass transit. It could share the remaining parking with the Mets and USTA. And most importantly, it would keep the professional sports complexes, which are car dependent, in a wing of the park. This way cars are not driving on parkland and there wouldn&#039;t be a need to displace thousands of soccer players by removing the 4 community soccer fields. <br /><br />There is some empirical evidence that this could work. Shea Stadium and CitiField co-existed for a long stretch of time while CitiField was being built. We know there can be two stadiums there. Plus, the footprint of a soccer stadium would be far smaller than the proposed footprint of the mall. <br /><br />Also, in several other cities, you see this set-up where one sports stadium is located next to another sports stadium. <br /><br />This all comes down to the simple fact that the community should have a voice and input in the design of these projects. Community members could have told any developer that asked that there are better sites for the soccer stadium and that we don&#039;t need another mall - there are already 7 malls within a 3 mile radius!<br /><br />Also, deeply troubling is the concept that the Bloomberg Administration would be giving away parkland for FREE. None of the three proposals has any mention of paying for the land or purchasing the land. And because it is parkland -- they wouldn&#039;t even have to pay property taxes. That is part of this proposal which is mind-boggling. We are looking at a budget crisis and considering laying off teachers but Mayor Bloomberg won&#039;t ask multi-billion dollar corporations to pay for land!<br /><br />
