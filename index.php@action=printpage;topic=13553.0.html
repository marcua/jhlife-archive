				I&#039;m beyond happy, relieved, and elated to announce that Jea is HOME safe and sound. We had been covering the extended neighborhood in flyers when we got a call that a dog matching Jea&#039;s description had been hiding out in someone&#039;s backyard at Northern Blvd and 86th Street. Not too far from home, but far enough. We got to the house and she was cowering in a back corner; a trail of bloody paw prints gave her away. She was so happy to see me that she peed! That&#039;s love. We took her to a vet to get checked out. She&#039;s got a few scrapes on her paws and is limping a little, but should be fine in a week or so. She lapped up a huge bowl of water, scarfed down a bowl of food, and is now sleeping on the couch- it was a tiring few days for the little pup!<br />Thank you so much to everyone who helped us, whether it was posting flyers, spreading pictures on facebook, or just generally sending good thoughts our way. Special shoutout to Heavenly Angels Animal Rescue Inc. and Lost Pet Professionals for going above &amp; beyond. We&#039;re so happy to have her home and to know that such a great community has our backs.

				We&#039;re all relieved. She&#039;s beautiful. And lucky to get another chance. You deserve a lot of credit yourself. Was the &quot;finder&quot; a result of one of your flyers, this site, one of the orgs.? just curious.&nbsp;

				It ended up being one of the flyers. But I was very impressed with how far and how quickly word spread due to various posts online and people circulating the flyers!
