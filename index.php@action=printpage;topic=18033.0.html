				If you fast foward to the 4:00 min mark you see a picture of 74th Street and see the very same buildings that are present now. Except for new storefronts of different businesses you see how little 74th Street has changed since the 1960’s. No boom in construction here and you wonder how long these one story buildings next to a major subway stop can last. It could be that almost the entire block being owned by Midwood who has blocked a merchants association and doesn’t want to invest in the neighborhood has a lot to do with it. No new housing here folks.

				Thanks for this.<br /><br />What&#039;s truly astonishing is how little all of Queens has changed since the 1960&#039;s (apart from businesses and demographics)...<br /><br />Many other places around the Western world are unrecognizable compared to the 1960&#039;s. <br /><br />Maybe only LIC (and perhaps now Flushing) has really been developed.<br /><br />Fascinating...<br /><br />

				People want the NYC before “white flight” to the suburbs of the 1970’s back. This resulted in the bankrupting of NYC. With those cars and no traffic on the highways people bought in Long Island and saved on taxes. Now NYC has become the place to be and people are fleeing the high property taxes of Long Island which thanks to the President are no longer deducted from income taxes. Ironic really.

				if they ever do a gofundme, they&#039;ll probably offer tiki torch premiums.<br /><br />then again, Queens has always been a place where some of the populace would consider Archie Bunker a libtard for letting two-strike minority Sammy Davis Jr. in his home.

				The Governor is pushing hard to protect mostly white wealthy suburbs. Who pays more 10k property tax? The property tax system produces segregated communities.&nbsp; <br /><br />https://nypost.com/2018/07/17/states-to-file-lawsuit-to-retain-local-and-state-tax-write-offs/?utm_campaign=iosapp&amp;utm_source=pasteboard_app

				Hey, I like the old time color photos. They are hard to find and come from an era that predates my memories of JH. I ignore the comments section. Those old 1960’s cars lined up on 74th Street are cool to look at.
