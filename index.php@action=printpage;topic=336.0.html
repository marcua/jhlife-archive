				From a press release available at http://www.soyandina.com/weblog/2008/01/pachamama-peruv.html ...<br /><br />The Center for Traditional Music and Dance (http://www.ctmd.org/pachamama/indexppa.htm) and the Pachamama Organizing Committee are pleased to present El NiÃ±o. Featuring the students of Pachamama Peruvian Arts and their master instructors: Luz Pereira, Rosa Carhuallanqui, Patricio Paucar and HÃ©ctor Morales, El NiÃ±o is an original musical based on a Peruvian folk narrative. A sorcerer traps the spirit of La NiÃ±a, the goddess responsible for cooling the ocean waters off of Peru. The only way to release her is through the sound of the pututo (shell horn), the playing of music and the elaborate dance of the god El NiÃ±o. Written by Pachamama Artistic Director, Carlos D. Bernales, El NiÃ±o showcases Pachamama Peruvian Arts students performing cajÃ³n, zampoÃ±a, quena, charango, marinera norteÃ±a, and marinera LimeÃ±a. Pachamama Peruvian Arts students have been studying these forms since September; and graduates will receive diplomas from their instructors. Special guest artists include Marcos Napa and Michael Ortiz with Eric Kurimski on guitar and Ileana Santamaria on vocals.<br /><br />Friday, February 1, 2008, 7:30PM<br />PS 212 Queens, 34-25 82nd Street, Jackson Heights, New York<br />Subway #7 to 82nd Street, (walk 3 blocks north), Bus: Q32 to 81st Street.<br /><br />Free!<br /><br />http://www.ctmd.org/pachamama/indexppa.htm<br /><br />Photo/Video Editors: Digital images and DVDs available.<br /><br />Pachamama Peruvian Arts first began offering free classes in the traditional performing arts of Peru in January 2004. Four years later, we are thrilled that over 400 students have attended weekly classes on the rhythms and techniques, history, and the social and cultural importance of Peruvian art forms at PS 212, Jackson Heights. An Open Registration for Spring Classes will be held from 3:30pm to 6:30pm at PS 212 on Friday, February 8, 2008. Spring classes include: marinera PuneÃ±a and pandilla (the elegant marinera from southern Peru) and carapachos (the ritual dance from the Amazon). In addition, Advanced Classes are available (for a small fee) in Afro-Peruvian percussion (cajÃ³n, cajita, quijada) and Andean music (zampoÃ±a, quena, charango).<br /><br />Pachamama Peruvian Arts seeks to strengthen the practice of traditional Peruvian music and dance, promote cultural interchange and mutual understanding among Peruvians, Peruvian Americans and the community at large and to empower New Yorkâ€™s Peruvian community with pride through youth education, workshops and collaborative community presentations throughout the New York metropolitan area. The Pachamama Organizing Committee is comprised of Peter Apaza, Sonya Lopes Bayonna, Carlos Bernales (Artistic Director), Rosa Carhuallanqui, Gabrielle M. Hamilton (Project Director), Andres Jimenez and Luz A. Pereira L. (Assistant Director). We welcome Peruvian musicians, dancers, artists, scholars and cultural activists to join us. If you are interested in learning more about our projects and mission, please contact Gabrielle Hamilton at 212-571-1555 x27 or gmhamilton@ctmd.org Pachamama Peruvian Arts is a Community Cultural Initiative of the Center for Traditional Music and Dance.
