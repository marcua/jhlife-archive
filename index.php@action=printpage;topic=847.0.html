				I&#039;m new to NY, and am beginning to look for something to buy.&nbsp; So many ads list building names but not street addresses.&nbsp; Have searched the web unsuccessfully for this information and am getting frustrated.&nbsp; Can anyone help me out?<br /><br />I&#039;d be so grateful!!!

				I&#039;ve never seen a list online, but if you check the current listings at http://www.jacksonheightsproperties.com/ and http://www.mpcproperties.com/queenscooplistings.php and http://www.beaudoinrealtor.com/CurrentListings/Coop.htm you will find a fair number of them listed with both the name and address.<br /><br />For a complete list of the historic buildings and addresses you might pick up a copy of &quot;Jackson Heights: A Garden in the City&quot; by Daniel Karatzas, who also runs Beaudoin Realtor.&nbsp; (Beaudoin has a blog on JH (http://jacksonheightsblog.com/) but I don&#039;t think there is a list on the blog). There is a list at the end of the book. They used to sell these books at Happy Kitchen and the gift store nearby (can&#039;t remember the name at the moment).&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they still do.

				this is listed under events too, but there is an upcoming historic weekend with tours of the various buildings and a map. Info cut &amp; pasted from www.jhbg.org. <br /><br />Self-Guided Tour of Private Interior Gardens; Saturday, 6/7; noon to 4:00 pm; $10 (Rain date: 6/14; all other events rain or shine)<br />These parklike interior gardens, surrounded by 1920s-era garden apartments, are only to the public only once a year. Visit up to nine gardens at your own pace, following a map included in your ticket. Tickets can be purchased in advance or in front of the Community Church the morning of the event.<br /><br />Escorted Walking Tours of the Historic District; Sunday, 6/8; meet at noon at the Community Church (southwestern corner of 82nd Street and 35th Avenue); $10<br />Tickets for this event must be purchased or reserved in advance.<br /><br /><br />FWIW, the name of the bldg says more than the location -- it also signifies whether it&#039;s with garden access or not, with or without elevator (top floor + elevator = high price, higher maintenance; top floor + stairs only = cheaper price, lower maintenance), whether it allows sublets (as a co-op owner, you are a lessee), full-time or part-time super, and managed as one big building (100+ units) or&nbsp; as 10 - 14 unit building. If you know what&#039;s important to you, you will be able to rule in and rule out buildings. In groups of buildings like Elm Court or Hawthorne Court where each bldg is managed separately, each bldg can have different maintenance and down payment requirements. In large buildings like the Towers or the Berkeley, all apts have the same maintenance per share and the same down payment requirements.

				Thanks, amj!&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to catch that garden tour.<br /><br />Do you know if there is a list that tells you which buildings offer which amenities, such as the garden access, co-op or condo status, elevator, etc. you mention?&nbsp; Or should one just go directly to a realtor with a list of preferred attributes?&nbsp; It strikes me this could be an interesting project and a useful guide.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll do it myself!<br /><br />By the way, I went to an Open House over the weekend hosted by MPC properties, and they gave out a brochure called Garden City Trail that had a useful map of Jackson Heights with historical information about buildings.&nbsp;

				If somebody wanted to compile this information and make it public, I think it would be a wonderfully helpful resource.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see it posted here.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it seems the only people with the time and motivation to collect this information -- the real estate agents -- also have an incentive not to publish it.&nbsp; Perhaps this is something we could make a collective project?

				WOW, amj, and thanks all contributors!&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to make a map on Google!&nbsp; <br /><br />SO-O-O-O glad to have found this forum!&nbsp; Whether or not I land in JH, I appreciate that you all constitute an &#039;advance guard&#039; community for those considering the neighborhood.<br /><br />Suffering from sticker shock :D while completing house sale in Central PA and entering this new world of real estate and a new life style all together.&nbsp; Still, compared to some area neighborhoods, prices seem reasonable and JH seems lively. <br /><br />We are looking for easy Express metro access, elevator bldg in case stairs become unmanageable, 2BR, sun and quiet --- an initial short list.&nbsp; I try to check NYT listings frequently, also certain Realtor listings.&nbsp; Are there resources I am neglecting?&nbsp; Is it best to enlist help of an area agent?<br /><br />Thanks again everyone!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				re unionized staff - a lot of the small buildings (like 10 units per building) have part-time supers who receive very little salary, but receive free rent. So if there is a couple who are supers, often one person also has another job, because even with free rent, who can live on $300 a month?&nbsp; The part-time super usually handles garbage, snow, sweeping the sidewalk and general maintenance of the common areas of the building. He or she is usually not expected to do anything inside your apartment, like any repairs or projects. He or she is also an employee at will who can leave at any time or be fired at any time. There is often a lot of turnover for these positions. <br /><br />Whereas in the larger buildings with unionized staff, the staff are full time and professional. They usually receive free or discounted rent as well as a real salary. They take care of the garbage, common areas, snow, etc but often can also make repairs or do projects that the building might otherwise have to hire someone to perform. Like the super in my unionized building repaired the radiator in my apt and installed child gates. The staff is part of the Service Employees International Union and negotiates with the Realty Advisory Board, which is an industry organization that represents apartment buildings.&nbsp; I think the last strike was in 1991, but there was almost one in 2006. So if there is a strike looming, even if the employees of&nbsp; your building are satisfied with the management/board of your building, they will strike if their union votes to do so. http://www.nysun.com/new-york/strike-may-soon-greet-new-yorkers-looking/30589/<br /><br />As someone who has lived in both types of buildings, I have better services in the building with the full-time unionized staff, but I pay more in monthly maintenance.

				Just to add to the &quot;?&quot; originally listed at Dunnolly Gardens, it is a co-op, but all 6 buildings are one co-op.&nbsp; (This was new for me .. I grew up for most of my childhood in Hawthorne and spent a decade in a Greystone ... both are, as said here, where each building is its own co-op.)<br /><br />
