			<strong>Jd143</strong>:
			<br />
			There&#039;s&nbsp; a grocery store on 81st street and 37th avenue... next to jahn&#039;s.&nbsp; They have a black kitten that needs a home.&nbsp; The store is closing.&nbsp; I can&#039;t&nbsp; take it.&nbsp; It was tempting but I have a 14 year old cat who is huge and violent towards other cats....don&#039;t even want to picture what he would do to the kitten.&nbsp; Can anyone help?

			Is the kitten still looking for a temporary/permanent home? I volunteer/foster for Advocat https://www.advocatrescue.org/ acat rescue that&#039;s based in Forest Hills, and we can help. There are also other rescues in Queens and in the NYC area, although I don&#039;t know of one in Jackson Heights.

			Does anyone know what happened to the black kitten?&nbsp; The store is closed and padlocked.&nbsp; I did not see a kitten inside and there was no response when I tapped on the door.&nbsp; I hope the owners did not leave her inside.

			It&#039;s weird because they ended up with another kitten too.&nbsp; It was orange and white.&nbsp; My daughter saw it and I thought it was odd.&nbsp; Why get another kitten if they were gonna close? Definitely no kitten abandoned there.&nbsp; I pass by multiple times a day and always look inside.&nbsp; Day and night.
