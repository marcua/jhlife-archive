				Had a very nice dinner inside Jax Inn last night.&nbsp; Was expecting to just go for a walk with hubby and pick up a take-out menu, but the few couples eating in booths were well spread out, Sinatra was playing, so after signing the book for tracing and having our temperature taken, we slid into a distanced booth.&nbsp; Tasty abundant food -- Cuban panini sandwich, falafel wrap -- cocktails, moderate (not cheap) cost, very attentive service, everyone masked, and observed the heavy stream of customers arriving to pick up pre-ordered food at reception counter or delivery people going out. Very nice for a quiet dinner without street noise, raucous music or hubbub of people milling about as on 37th.

				I&#039;ve always had a soft spot for Jax Inn... but their prices seem awfully high these days.

				the prices are on a par with any decent diner. you can definitely go cheaper, but if you do, you get canned vegetables, crappy salads and instant potatoes. i&#039;ll pay a premium to get actual food.

				I agree their prices are a bit much.&nbsp; But then, restaurant prices always seem too much to me -- the disparity between the price paid and the cost of ingredients to make it (I cook every night otherwise) is, for instance, the inverse of the cost for clothes, which (due to poorly paid seamstresses in Asia) one can often buy for less than the fabric, thread, and pattern would cost, not to mention the amount of labor involved.&nbsp; And all non-corporate establishments are suffering, so we support them when and as we can.&nbsp;

				but for entrees, i invariably get two meals out of a Jax Inn meal (and i&#039;m not a light eater). same for my partner. we can share one of the salads that comes with the entree (and those are good salads, not just iceberg) each day, and it&#039;s a pretty good deal IMO.

				&nbsp;I second these good reviews of Jax Inn. It&#039;s a solid diner type restaurant with some real flair in certain cuisines like Greek and Latin. A reliably good choice I love is their pizza burger and western egg on a roll but the more elaborate dinners are generous quantities and make for more than one meal always. The Greek deserts, especially the orange cake soaked with something?, is amazing and a destination type desert in my opinion. Am glad that they were able to adjust to Covid dining as they are an asset in this neighborhood serving across different ethnicities, ages and other preferences.
