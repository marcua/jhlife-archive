			If anyone is interested, please feel free to join the Jackson Heights Discord server. Discord is a chat platform. It&#039;s more akin to the chat rooms of the old days than a forum. It has &quot;servers&quot;, which are like little communities. Inside the servers are &quot;channels&quot; for different topics. For example, we have channels for &quot;general&quot;, &quot;food and drink&quot;, &quot;Meetups&quot;, &quot;parking spaces&quot;, and &quot;rooms for rent&quot;. Discord works in the browser or as a desktop/mobile app. Link to the server: https://discord.gg/YAZt4y8Uhx

			&nbsp;Thanks for making any alternatives to this site. The graphics look kind of light and tweeny. Is that the intended demographic?

			Yep, Discord is totally for the tween demographic.<br /><br />Tik Tok may be the next suggestion..?

			&nbsp;Yeah. We have so many bored tweens here in JH. Some on this board and they&#039;ll like it. Meanwhile Heather Cox Richardson on Substack is a thought provoking read. Nice to be outside the traditional machinery of news and commentary which is something I appreciated from this soon to be gone site.
