				I live in the historic distric and am infuriated with individuals who constantly tape postings on the streetlights, trees and telephone booths. Not only is it illegal, but it is selfish, cheap looking and constitutes vandalism and grafitti. One person, in particular, constantly, in the middle of the night, coordinates individuals throughout the entire 5 boroughs, to tape &quot;MOVING $19/man/hour&quot; sheets wrecklessly everywhere. When morning arrives, the neighborhood is filled with the results of selfishness and stupidity. I tear them off immediately, even if I spend an hour going around the entire community.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to say that I&#039;ve noticed others removing these posters. The JH Beautification Group does a great job as well. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if this person is really getting fined and doesn&#039;t care. What experiences do any readers out there notice with this vandilism?

				What seems strange to me is that the city is now targeting people who draw with chalk on the sidewalk for &#039;grafitti&#039; and assessing fines.&nbsp; Maybe they should be concentrating their efforts on other issues like the one you mention.<br /><br />On a related note, I know people are also fed up with the adveritisers who dump large stacks of circulars at the doors to the coop buildings.&nbsp; I recently learned that there was legislation passed to make this illegal - but the building must post a sign saying they don&#039;t want them<br /><br />I learned about it on another neighborhood blog (Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn) http://planetplg.blogspot.com/2007/09/ugly-circulars-be-gone-magic-of-micro.html<br /><br />However, even though it is illegal doesn&#039;t mean there will be a crackdown on offenders.

				I live in one of the co-ops within the historic district, and not too long ago, we had an issue with some of the elderly shareholders in our building regarding these market circulars.&nbsp; They put up a fight to keep them coming after the Board had put a stop to them.&nbsp; To make a long story short, we still get delivery because of the demand for them.

				Frankly, I enjoy the circulars.<br /><br />They are put in our mailroom and whoever wants to jot down what&#039;s on sale and save money food shopping can do so.<br /><br />Have you noticed how the price of food is escalating?&nbsp; Have you?<br /><br />These circulars help those of us who enjoy comparison shopping and living simply and frugally -- though sometimes not by choice.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I&#039;m one of the elderly....

				I just heard on the news that the price of a Thanksgiving dinner (cooked at home) has gone up 11% since just last year.&nbsp; Part of this is because of fuel prices for distribution.<br /><br />

				The posting on the poles &amp; trees bother me less than the crap that gets placed on car. On principal I refuse to order from any restaurant that litters. And I do consider these flyers to be litter as they mostly end up in the street.
