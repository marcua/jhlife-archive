				Thank you for posting this! I think some are in denial and think that their pet is special and make themselves believe they will be adopted. I have found many animals over the years and fostered them, found fosters or adopted them out. I think their should be a list where people who give up animals are not allowed to have another one.&nbsp; I know in the eyes of the law they are considered &quot;property&quot; but they are living beings.

				Update:&nbsp; This cat is on the Urgent TO BE put to death row list so she is not being euthanized tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Apparently there is a watchdog group that posts cats in jeopardy.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in adopting her please let me know.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any information regarding her personality I can send you a photo or you can go to the AC &amp; C website and type in her number A1056682 <br />I am told that surrenders have no specific hold time.&nbsp; The whole system is crazy and convoluted to work with.

				I volunteered at Brooklyn CACC until my heart couldn&#039;t take it anymore.&nbsp; It is hell on earth for any animal that ends up there.<br /><br />The only thing I can say in their defense - because there are certainly people working there that care about animals, is that they MUST accept every animal that comes through their doors.&nbsp; That means they are constantly overloaded - especially in the warmer months, when people too cheap or too clueless to spay/neuter their pet, bring in box after box after box of litters of kittens and puppies.<br /><br />

				Hi! I just emailed the Animal Care &amp; Control website regarding Saffron/Luna. I would like to adopt her,&nbsp; but I will be out of town from Saturday, July 2nd&nbsp; to Sunday, July 10th. I&#039;m not sure if she is still there or not--or if they would be willing to hold her for that long. According to the website, she is still there, but I am not sure how accurate that is....
