			My co-op currently does not allow dogs (cats are ok). <br />Before starting a petition, I wanted to find out which buildings in Jackson Heights allow dogs.&nbsp; <br />Are there specific conditions or requirements? Pet agreements? Size requirements?<br />Any other considerations?<br /><br />Thanks for any info!<br /><br />

			We are dog owners, in a pet friendly coop, but if you bought a place with a &quot;no dogs&quot; rule, so did others.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s not fair to owners to change rules to their home.&nbsp;

			Dogs were allowed in our building up to 20 years ago when the board decided to change this rule. It might have been due to lazy and inconsiderate dog owners.<br /><br />The demographic of the building has changed a lot in the past decade and many neighbors have expressed interest in having dogs. I am only trying to assess whether the majority of our building is for or against changing this rule.

			Our co-op voted for a one-off exemption for someone to keep a dog temporarily.<br /><br />The trouble was that when left alone in the apartment the dog barked incessantly. <br /><br />And so I don&#039;t think the co-op will vote that way again...<br /><br />

			Our small coop recently approved the first dog in many years, but only after drawing up an agreement that specified what issues would trigger a request to the shareholder to find a new home for the dog. Our rules say dogs only by special permission, and I have heard that in the past there were dogs that did create noise and mess that bothered other tenants significantly. With most of us now working from home--and the kids here doing school at home--it&#039;s even more important that a dog not bark all day long and disrupt everyone. But we did approve the dog, which has recently arrived, and so far I&#039;ve not heard a peep out of her. And she&#039;s really cute. I hope it works out, but on the other hand, I do think that in a small coop it might be a problem if everyone had a dog. Especially if they were larger dogs, who might not only bark but also make considerable noise running around the apartment.
