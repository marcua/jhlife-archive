				Everyone please examine your receipts carefully from Foodtown. On each of my last three shopping trips there, I did not get the card member advertised sales price on items that I had purchased. I carefully checked my receipts and it does indicate my member card was successfully scanned, yet I was charged full price for the items, which included yogurt, shredded cheese, frozen foods, and canned soup.<br /><br />On my next trip, I will avoid the self-checkout and go to the cashier and raise hell if I don&#039;t receive the advertised sales price.

				Some advertised items on special @ Foodtown require digital coupons. From a terminal near the self check out.

				Another crazy system at Foodtown is that the 10% senior discount on Wed and Fri is listed as zero, then a total discount, which must include savings on sale items, is listed below.&nbsp; ???&nbsp; Impossible to tell if you got the senior 10% on all the non-sale items.

				Foodtown had boneless leg of lamb on sale this past week for $7.99. They did not have any out, so I spoke to the butcher. They said that management had only ordered one piece of lamb. I always thought that foodtown was overpriced and now they blatantly false advertise too.

				Without wanting to defend Foodtown in any way whatsoever, it&#039;s seems pretty common practice for supermarkets to advertize items in their circulars that they (will) never stock. Examples from other stores in the nabe (you know who you are) include sales on sea salt, or a pork-veal-beef meatloaf combo, or fresh-frozen cod filets, ... . It&#039;s difficult to determine whether it&#039;s corporate or local management that has forgotten the meaning of &quot;loss leader&quot; in favor of the practice known as &quot;bait and switch.&quot; :-\
