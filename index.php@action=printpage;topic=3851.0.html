				I usually go to Annette Donnelly on 78th Street bet. 37th and 35th Ave. &nbsp;She&#039;s really nice and she is good but she only works part time and no Saturdays. &nbsp;So I&#039;m looking for a back up (pun intended) chiropractor. &nbsp;Any suggestions?<br /><br />I have an appointment this afternoon with Evan Appel on 87th and 37th. &nbsp;First time going to him. &nbsp;I found him online so hope he&#039;s good. &nbsp;Not looking for anyone outside of the neighborhood ... I know of others in Astoria or the City ... but want to walk to the office not drive or heaven forbid TAKE A TRAIN!!! &nbsp;ugh. &nbsp; (I know how that will stir the pot! HA)

				I went to Andrew Adlerstein on 73rd and 35th Ave. Nice guy, and what he did worked for me. His staff is also very nice. <br />

				Aronan, Dr. Adlerstein is another one I phoned but Appel got back to me first AND had time open today so I went to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />He had a very small office he shares with his sister who is a podiatrist.&nbsp; Their father was a podiatrist on 37th Ave. for the past 50 years and now the office is chiro and podiatry.<br /><br />A good, thorough adjustment.&nbsp; Began with electric stim under a heat pack, then sonogram (never understood how it works because you don&#039;t feel a sonogram working but I&#039;m a sucker for &quot;bells and whistles&quot;.)&nbsp; Then Dr. Appel adjusted all the usual places: back, neck and hips AND then adjusted every other joint - head to toe.&nbsp; He did shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands fingers -- you get the picture.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only had one other chiropractor who did feet or arms depending on what your complaint was so I was pleasantly surprised by it all.<br /><br />I feel better.&nbsp; I have no idea what he charged because I have insurance and the claim is being put thru.&nbsp; I just paid a co-pay.&nbsp; Cool.<br /><br />Aronan, I may still try Adlerstein another time just to have more than one since most doctors work out of more than one office and aren&#039;t always available when I have a small window of opportunity.&nbsp; Thanks for the recommendation.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was looking for a local chiropractor and found Evan Appel through the provider directory.&nbsp; When questioned about being in-network, he lied and said that he was.&nbsp; I had a thorough adjustment which lasted about 45 minutes for which he filed a claim with BC/BS for over $1300!&nbsp; It included several therapies, charges for 3 office visits and a $500 stim machine and BioFreeze gel&nbsp; that I never received.&nbsp; When BC/BS denied the majority of his claim, he submitted a handwritten envelope Demanding payment for the balance.&nbsp; The day after he mailed that envelope, he filed a claim in small claims court.&nbsp; Mind you this was all within a month of my one and only visit. I&#039;ve been using chiropractors for over 20 years and the claim for a visit had never exceeded $150.&nbsp; My wife also went to him for an adjustment a few days prior to mine, and he followed the same scam with her.&nbsp; We both went to small claims court only to meet another one of his patients who was also being sued.&nbsp; We decided to have the case settled through arbitration and still ended up paying almost $500 because the arbitrator didn&#039;t understand that the stim machine and other services were never delivered.&nbsp; All in all, he managed to scam BC/BS and us for over $1000 for 2 office visits.<br /><br />Find another chiropractor and expect to see a handwritten extortion letter Appel, and a summons from civil court.&nbsp; With con artists like Appel, it&#039;s no wonder that insurance companies are denying claims from legitimate chiropractors.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the recommendation.&nbsp; I&#039;ll check if she&#039;s in my plan and go from there.&nbsp; For now, I&#039;m trekking out to Syosset, LI whenever I need an adjustment.&nbsp; My chiropractor said he&#039;d do house calls about once a week as he passes through the area.&nbsp; A portable table could work, but I can&#039;t see him hauling a stim machine and hydrocolator.

				I know this thread is about chiropractors, but I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents about back pain - if that&#039;s what it is that people are dealing with.<br /><br />My two recommendations are: <br /><br />1. Feldenkrais - which is not well known, but I have found to be amazing for pain relief (not just back pain).&nbsp; &nbsp;You can go to a practitioner who will do a hands-on technique, or you can go to classes.&nbsp; There&#039;s a great place in midtown where the classes are only $9.<br /><br />http://www.physicaltherapynyc.com/feldenkrais/about.htm<br /><br /><br />2. An amazing and super-easy yoga dvd for back pain.&nbsp; This one is good even for yoga-phobes.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Viniyoga-Therapy-Back-Sacrum-Kraftsow/dp/B000U0C9UE

				So in the last week, I&#039;ve gone back to Evan Appel and also to Annette Donnelly who is back from vacation.<br /><br />TBM, you would probably like Annette because she does muscle work: stretching, rotating, kinesiogly etc. &nbsp;She doesn&#039;t have elec. stim or use heat packs though. &nbsp;But she takes her time to loosen you up before adjusting. &nbsp;She&#039;s very good. &nbsp;Located on 78th bet. 37th and 35th Aves.<br /><br />Appel gave me another really good adjustment, also.&nbsp; (I like both their adjustments: diff. styles.) &nbsp;I&#039;ve already gotten my paperwork from BC/BS and he is in network so everything was fine. &nbsp;I just paid my co-pay again.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy with them both. &nbsp;They work a bit differently and are available on different days. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t really get into anything with Appel because in situations like this it becomes &quot;he said, she said&quot; so there&#039;s no point. <br /><br />I do think Annette is definitely more what I prefer personality wise and she takes cash or check and she&#039;s NOT EXPENSIVE at all. &nbsp;Check her out.
