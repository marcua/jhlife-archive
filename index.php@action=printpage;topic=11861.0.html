				I am opening up my heart to you, internet! I have never played Dungeons and Dragons but <em><strong>I want to</strong></em> (at least try). Does anyone on here play? Are you willing to host a trial run for me in exchange for... something? Maybe your regular group has gone sour and you need a replacement? That nameless replacement could be me! <br /><br />If you have a group, know of a group or just want to make fun of me for posting this in the first place, click <strong>reply</strong> below.

				Does <em><strong>anyone</strong></em> still play D&amp;D in this age of World of Warcraft and all those other MMORPGs?<br /><br />I&#039;ve still got my first edition <em>Dungeon Master&#039;s Guide, Player&#039;s Handbook, Monster Manual,</em> plenty of dice, and a handful of modules in a box in storage, but I haven&#039;t actually played the game in at least 25 years! I was thinking I&#039;d save these for my nephews when they were old enough to play, but... if I had a good reason to dust them off...&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)

				You&#039;re probably right that the pool of people still actively playing DnD is quite small, but I thought the internet was the best place to find them. It would be so much easier to get together if everyone was in the same neighborhood, which is why I started my search on here, but I may expand to a more city-wide search if it comes down to it. <br /><br />Next time you have to get something from storage, you should also grab all the game material. Maybe by then, a group will have emerged from hiding and we can put them to use.
