				stevengray:<br /><br />i totally respect your statements.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />you raise an interesting point regarding the current status of jackson heights. and as someone who has lived in nyc for just about my entire life, and in many many neighborhoods -- some of which i was forced out of by gentrification -- i find it better to raise questions about gentrification and wholesale changes BEFORE they happen than in rueful regret after the fact. <br /><br />i remember a new york where neighborhoods had character. where the east 80s were discernibly different than the west 40s. where astoria was different than carroll gardens. where upper flatbush-- where i lived in the &#039;86-&#039;87 -- wasn&#039;t just park slope redux. that&#039;s the new york i have loved since my childhood. granted, some people want a neighborhood that&#039;s exactly the same as every other area in the city -- oh sure, pretending that keeping indian grocers and carryouts, but secretly hoping each and every one of them is replaced by a trader joe&#039;s, a brooklyn bagel, a bliss spa, any number of things that will drive out the riff raff. i&#039;m not one of them.<br /><br />we can&#039;t have it both ways. we can&#039;t have raja foods AND 25 dollar entree french joints. we can&#039;t have both inexpensive groceries AND whole foods. i know which i prefer. i know which i moved to jackson heights to be around. and, fortunately, i don&#039;t get the sense that my entrenched neighbors are going to be driven away the way people were in many of my other neighborhoods.

				well, the only time i&#039;ve ever set foot in a starbucks was at a jersey turnpike exit, so i wouldn&#039;t necessarily call that a harbinger of gentrifcation, just a purveyor of substandard fast food. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />as far as la portena -- and la fusta and a couple of the places along northern -- i see &#039;homegrown&#039; upscale places as a little different. i might be way way off base on that. but in general, i am drawing from my experience living in places like carroll gardens (when smith street looked a lot like roosevelt avenue does now, but DID have a few upscale red sauce joints) and the lower east side (circa 1983). the floodgates opened there, commercial rents skyrocketed and generation-old mainstays got replaced by schmancy newcomers who went belly up in months, leaving rows of vacant storefronts. those weren&#039;t isolated incidents....they were the rule. and often still are.<br /><br />i think that sometimes -- not always -- relative newcomers to a neighborhood (and after 15 years, i am still on the fringe of that status) tend to gravitate towards each other and not befriend old timers. and that people from different economic/social groups do the same. as such, there&#039;s an assumption that people all want the same thing. the fabric stores and by-the-gram jewelry places stay in business because there are a whole lot of people who want/need what they&#039;re selling. would a JH version of murray&#039;s cheese do the same? i don&#039;t know. i honestly doubt it, because that sort of shopper -- while present -- is a small part of this neighborhood. if someone wants to try it, bless &#039;em and i might even give a shot (although i doubt they&#039;d be as good overall as d&#039;espana has been for ages). :)

				This is a touchy subject for me.&nbsp; I was born and raised here.&nbsp; My parents still live here.&nbsp; I stayed when all my childhood friends left.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived through the good and the not so good times.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to see the place gentrified a la Park Slope.&nbsp; But I also don&#039;t have this romanticized view of a Jackson Heights that&#039;s &quot;cool&quot; because it has graffiti.&nbsp; And I cannot stand the people who approach this place like its an episode of National Geographic.<br /><br />When I was young we had a ton of Irish bars that had character and characters.&nbsp; They are all gone.&nbsp; We had Jewish delis and butchers where the guys behind the counter knew your name.&nbsp; We had a lot of things that were pushed out by the economic gentrification that raised rents on businesses that had been a part of this neighborhood for years.&nbsp; For some, diversity meant losing your lease.<br /><br />No, I&#039;m not longing for the &quot;good old days&quot; when most of the neighborhood was White.&nbsp; I love diversity, that&#039;s why I stayed when everyone I knew left.&nbsp; But diversity doesn&#039;t mean that there is no place in the community for the places that serve some of my needs. I shouldn&#039;t have to leave Jackson Heights in order to buy a book, a burger or a cocktail.&nbsp; I prefer Thai and Indian food to French cuisine, but sometimes I want to have a bistro experience.&nbsp; I LIKE Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; I wish there was one in the neighborhood and I&#039;m not going to apologize for that.&nbsp;

				i agree with a lot of what you&#039;re saying, queenskid:<br /><br />i lived on the lower east side from the age of 17 to about 22. i thought it was romantic and cool to have heroin dealt from my stoop (because the dealers protected us in return for letting them use it). that&#039;s ridiculous to the adult version of me. i do miss the other aspects of that community, but that&#039;s another matter. <br /><br />no, i don&#039;t long for graffiti or the prostitition and open drug dealing that was part and parcel of roosevelt avenue 15 years ago. i do have some common sense. &nbsp;:)<br /><br />and, of course, it&#039;d be nice to have a bookstore. but in terms of character, don&#039;t you have a certain fondness for the new york that did have some differentation from neighborhood to neighborhood, where every single ten block area didn&#039;t have the exact same elements -- a fusion asian place, a &#039;new american&#039; bistro, 36 banks and no hardware stores, delis, real bakeries, etc.? that&#039;s all i am saying. i am willing to make a trek to bensonhurst and dyker heights for genuine old school italian (not a newbie&#039;s interpretation of same). i love going to flatbush to eat really great vegetarian caribbean food and so on. i don&#039;t think all of those things need to be right on 37th avenue. after all, most people have to leave their neighborhood for some things they desire -- which explains five boroughs (and beyond) worth of folks converging on sripraphai weekly.<br /><br /><br />i hope this wasn&#039;t too rambling!<br /><br />p.s. the best burger in the city is ten minutes away at donovan&#039;s. :rockon:

				It was really NOT my intention to start a new thread on the dreaded G-word. The subject is far too complex to truly discuss in a limited forum such as this, and when matters of race, ethnicity, language, income and social class are brought into play, it can be like navigating through a minefield. However, I will say that New York City has always been in a constant state of flux, with new groups of immigrants filling the voids left when the previous generation had moved on. Our neighborhoods are constantly changing and evolving along with the times in which we live, the city&#039;s demographics, and economic conditions. We are blessed to live in a city where one can simply hop on the subway and be transported in minutes to a neighborhood with its own special character, cuisine, and culture, and I am hopeful that will not change even after another four years of Mayor Bloomberg. We are fortunate in that Jackson Heights itself has so many to sample from. <br />

				Personally I just think Jackson Heights Residents are spoiled me being one. Our neighborhood is so alive literally at all times during the day and night. It can be 3AM and I know I can go buy food at a restaurant or cart(Pollos Marios, Tacos, Sammys, Kebab King, perrada de chalo, Dunkin Doughnuts, Ihop)... Ran out of milk?! don&#039;t worry you have trade fair, Walgreen&#039;s, 711, Duane Reade, rite aid all open 24/7, Head hurts well you already know most of pharmacies are 24/7... Making a gourmet Asian meal? Why go to whole foods to buy Asian ingredients when you can shop at our local Asian markets and purchase them at a much more reasonable price&nbsp; (Korean, Chinese, Indian, Japanese) Don&#039;t like starbucks and rather enjoy really coffee by baristas rather than a some lady pressing buttons go to E77, I really don&#039;t know why we complain, in the end i just think were a bunch of spoiled brats asking for more!<br /><br />Those are my two cents. Take the subway or drive to trader Joe&#039;s, whole foods, etc... and stop being lazy.

				<strong><br />MY TWO CENTS<br /><br />Gentrification in this City has been a tale of two Cities- One white and the other primarily nonwhite. &nbsp;Jackson Heights has had different stages. &nbsp;I got here in the 90&#039;s. &nbsp;There was still alot of crime and grime but rents were afordable and people of lower middle class levels could live here. &nbsp;Now a 1 bedroom fetches upwards of $1500. &nbsp;Who really benefits from that? &nbsp;A very small circle of landlords who now use craigslist to draw clients who can no longer afford Manhattan or parts of Brooklyn. &nbsp;I am not really a bleeding heart at all but this neighborhood will soon be out of reach <br />Bottom line here folks soon we and our community&#039;s income level will not be able to purchase or even rent here. &nbsp;Where does end???</strong>
