			New Parent / Breastfeeding Support Group<br />Second Tuesday of the month - next meeting November 12, 2019<br />10:00 – 11:30 am<br />$10<br />2nd Story Pilates &amp; Yoga, 81-10 37th Ave, Jackson Heights, Queens NY<br />https://www.secondstorymovement.com/<br /><br />Please join us for a support group for new parents! It can be isolating at home with a new baby, so many questions, conflicting advice, and sleep deprived to boot. Meet some neighbors and have your questions answered with compassion and experience to help navigate what works best for your family. We will have snacks! <br /><br />As a postpartum and birth doula and certified breastfeeding counselor, Rachel Goldstein has helped countless NYC families with the transition to parenthood over the past decade. Please wear your baby as there is a flight of stairs to climb and no stroller parking. We can’t wait to meet you! All are welcome, you don’t have to be breastfeeding.<br /><br />Please register here: https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/ws?studioid=624865&amp;stype=-8&amp;sView=day&amp;sLoc=0&amp;sTrn=100000049. See you soon!<br /><br />SAVE THE DATES: Upcoming meetings on Nov 12, Dec 10, Jan 14, Feb 11, Mar 10, Apr 14, May 12<br /><br />https://postmodernchildbirth.com/services/lactation-support/
