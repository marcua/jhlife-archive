				https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/amazon-is-opening-a-checkout-free-grocery-store-in-nyc-091118<br /><br />OK, so EVENTUALLY Foodtown and every supermarket will have checkout free options. <br /><br />That&#039;s exciting.<br /><br />However, if the technology is anything like the self check-out machines @ our Foodtown, I suppose, alas, it&#039;ll be down at least 25% of the time.

				never use the automated options, never will.<br /><br />that&#039;s the beauty of modern life. you can cling to outdated notions like dealing with people and thinking they should have jobs or move into a bright, gleaming future where personal interaction is minimized and we can concentrate on what really matters. podcasts.

Happened to me just yesterday, a guy got upset for my speaking spanish to him because he looked hispanic. my bad. banish me. silence my kind. I am an ethno-ist!<br /><br />for what it&#039;s worth, I still think he was hispanic, he did understand what I said to him.

				I read a news story about a woman who was arrested for theft after she operated a self-checkout stand in a Target or a Walmart, I forget which store or where this happened. Turns out the system malfunctioned somehow and they tracked her down and arrested her for stealing $XXX worth of merchandise. Then the security cameras showed her repeatedly scanning these items, trying to get the system to work properly, and she was vindicated. It was the system&#039;s fault, not hers, but I think she actually was thrown in jail for awhile. That is scary and made me even more determined than I already was not to use those systems. I must say, though, that the checkout lines at Foodtown have gotten really insanely long lately.
