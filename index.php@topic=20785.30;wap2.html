			it&#039;s always nice to hear from the pro-disease side. nothing&#039;s quite as heartwarming during the holidays as seeing someone giggle about 17,000 people in the ICU and 1500 dying per day.<br /><br />let me save you the time -- i know it&#039;s &quot;just the flu,&quot; as is congestive heart failure.

			Believe it or not, I&#039;m not a *it&#039;s just a flu* person. The only point of this limited and specific thread is that the dreaded omicron variant is a red herring, trumped up by doom-porn peddling news outlets. Now that the CDC has downgraded their *estimate of the Omicron percentage AND shortened asymptomatic to five days, I&#039;m sure cases and deaths will skyrockets right past the James Webb telescope. (Note my withering sarcasm)..&nbsp; long story short? Stay vigilant, get a booster, and live life!

			&nbsp;Thanks Chickenring. We&#039;ve been too just that. Hyper vigilant, mask wearing, avoiding congregant setting (except for the needed subway/bus rides) and knock wood, life goes on. <br />Relatives have spoken of growing up in areas of long term conflict in a similar way. Just putting one foot in front of the other and taking the necessary as best as possible.
