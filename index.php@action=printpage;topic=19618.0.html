				Been there a few times and thought I should make a thread about this yummy place.<br /><br />It&#039;s in an awkward location (on Roosevelt on top of the QBE, basically) but it&#039;s a great bakery. And they always seem to give us free/extra bread&nbsp; 8)

				I found this bakery by accident.&nbsp; The bakery is every bit as nice as Farine.<br /><br />I have had loaves of bread and a few types of pastries and they were very good.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if the bakery was opened because of the new Roosevelt Parc building.

				the plain white baguette from french toast is <em>nowhere near</em> as good as the balthazar baguette from farine<br /><br />......crust not as caramelized, dough wrong consistency - almost like a ciabatta.&nbsp; if you like baguette-shaped ciabattas, fine.....<br /><br />

				Personally I think Farine has better desserts but French Toast Bakery has better savory breads (e.g. they have yummy cheese bread loaves). But the desserts are good too. Good brownies :-)<br /><br />I think it&#039;s been open for a while, maybe 9 months? It&#039;s just in a weird spot that is easy to miss.

				I thought it was really good! And if it competes with Farine, that&#039;s pretty damn good

				<br />Their business will be very healthy once Roosevelt Parc is filled with tenants, assuming that&#039;s why they chose that location....Will be interesting to see what else pops up around there.

				Noticed when I walked by on Monday morning that they looked closed &amp; there was a &quot;For Rent&quot; sign in the window. It&#039;s a cute friendly place, sad to see them go
