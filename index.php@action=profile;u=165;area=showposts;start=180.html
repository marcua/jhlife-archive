					--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Quote from: NYCMacUser on January 22, 2008, 11:47:22 PM<br />I beg to differ with you. There is NO shortage of housing in New York. There is, however, a shortage of affordable housing in New York. And, if it wasn&#039;t for the combination of rent control/stabilization laws, and the younger generation&#039;s willingness to share living space, this City would be totally void of all but the wealthy!<br /><br />Well, rather than engage in a pointless war of words, in which I &quot;cut and paste&quot; articles from websites to back up my claims, and you &quot;cut and paste&quot; articles to back up your argument, it&#039;s best that we &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have my personal beliefs and ideas, as do you.&nbsp; It&#039;s safe to assume that you&#039;re probably not an economist nor a researcher involved in studying housing/rent control regulations (I&#039;m not), and you nor I have not spent years conducting controlled studies of the impact of rent control regulations on housing markets in various cities (New York, San Francisco, Cambridge, Mass., Berkeley, California, etc.), and are able to back up your claims with your empirical research.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the end of the day, our emotions and feelings are irrelevant to the issues, facts are.

					&quot;What we really need here is commercial rent regulation so that the little guy still stays in business. Remember...greed is one of the seven deadly sins&quot;<br /><br />Having government (especially the inept New York City council) step in and mandate a commercial rent regulation would be the worst possible thing anyone could do.&nbsp; The end result would be that landlords would simply stop renting to businesses, since government would set rents so low that landlords wouldn&#039;t be able to make any money.&nbsp; Witness the shortage in housing in New York due to rent control laws.&nbsp; <br /><br />Price controls didn&#039;t work in the old Soviet Union, they don&#039;t work in Cuba nor North Korea, and they won&#039;t work in New York City either.&nbsp; Even the North Koreans know this, as they have relaxed price controls recently and allowed limited free markets to operate.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in favor of commercial rent regulations, maybe a move to Cuba or North Korea might be in order.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that North Korean winters are simply marvelous, and according to Michael Moore, Cuba is at the forefront of all the latest medical developments, not those evil capitalist companies such as Pfizer and Bristol Myers!&nbsp; <br /><br />As for greed being one of the seven deadly sins, I&#039;ll allow Gordon Gecko the last word on that:<br /><br />&quot;The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that: Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right; greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge â€” has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words â€” will not only save Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.&quot; <br />

					I agree!&nbsp; Shame on those NYPD officers, who earn a base salary of $59,588 after 5 1/2 years of service, for doing their jobs!&nbsp; <br /><br />They should simply stop pursuing criminals, and flying overhead with their noisy helicoptors!&nbsp; How dare they disturb the peace in the neighborhood, and prevent everyone from achieving &quot;REM Stage&quot; sleep!&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s better that they simply allow the criminals to &quot;do their jobs&quot;.&nbsp; After all, those poor criminals were forced into their lines of work due to oppression by &quot;the man&quot;!&nbsp; <br /><br />And if those criminals break into your co-op, steal your belongings, violently assault you, cause your property values to plummet, you can always blame the police for NOT doing their jobs!

					Let&#039;s see - There&#039;s transexual/transvestite prostitutes trawling along Roosevelt Avenue, in fact I&#039;ve seen them on my way to work on the corner by McDonald&#039;s around 7:45AM this summer.&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s trash on the streets and all sorts of other social ills, and people are worried about &quot;large breasted mannequins&quot;?&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t get it!&nbsp; <br /><br />I personally favor the mannequins!&nbsp; It&#039;s probably the best aspect of South American culture that I can truly &quot;embrace&quot;, if only visually with my eyes!&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m more concerned about these asshole teenagers that go about with their mobile phones on the subways, and feel that they have the right to subject me to their idiotic pornographic nursery rhymes.&nbsp; (What are commonly referred to in the media as &quot;Rap Music&quot; or &quot;Hip Hop&quot;.)&nbsp; In fact, just yesterday, I was in the Chinese restaurant on the corner of 78th St. and 37th Ave, waiting for my food, and one of these left half of the IQ bell curve cretins comes in with his mobile phone, playing his pornographic nursery rhymes for the whole damn restaurant to hear!&nbsp; Of course the Chinese people working there were either:&nbsp; too damn scared to tell this imbecile to turn the crap off, for fear that he had a gun or knife, or too polite to say anything.&nbsp; My money is on:&nbsp; too damn scared!&nbsp; I would have loved to beat the hell out of that idiot, but I suppose it&#039;s best that I &quot;respect his culture&quot; and let him enjoy his pornographic nursery rhymes, even if it means annoying everyone else in the restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />And people are worried about mannequins?&nbsp;

					&quot;That&#039;s Life&quot; - Is the most polite way I can say it.<br /><br />Neighorhoods, along with civilizations, empires, countries, even the stars, are born, go through a period of maturation, decline, and eventually die.&nbsp; The only constant in life is change.&nbsp; <br /><br />People like to bring up these false arguments against gentrification, as if it&#039;s better that a neighborhood remained &quot;authentic&quot; and mired in poverty, rather than &quot;outsiders&quot; (99% of the time this is a code word for &quot;whites&quot;, &quot;gringos&quot;, &quot;gabachos&quot;, &quot;crackers&quot;, &quot;honkies&quot;, whatever the current term used in the Third World Studies Department at UC Berkeley to disparage those of European background) come in and the neighborhood shows signs of improvement.<br /><br />People also seem to forget that neighborhoods in the New York City area are in a constant state of flux.&nbsp; What about the neighborhood known today as Harlem?&nbsp; Of course we all know the Indians were there first.&nbsp; If there&#039;s anyone who has a legitimate &quot;beef&quot; with gentrification, it starts and ends with the Indians who were indeed &quot;here first&quot;!&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Wikipedia, Harlem was named by the Dutch after the city in Holland known as Haarlem (two A&#039;s), back in the 1600&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Dutch were eventually displaced by the English.&nbsp; Fast forward to the early 1900&#039;s, and Wikipedia continues noting the arrival of East European Jews, which reached a peak of 150,000 in 1917.&nbsp; Jews were eventually displaced with the arrival of Blacks in large numbers from the South.&nbsp; And, in the past 10-20 years, Harlem is still going through changes, with whites returning to buy brownstones/buildings, even our &quot;first black president&quot; Bill Clinton has an office in Harlem.&nbsp; Starbuck&#039;s, Ben and Jerry&#039;s, Magic Johnson Cinemas, Gap, etc. etc. all have stores in the Harlem neighborhood now.&nbsp; Walk through Harlem and you&#039;ll also see signs of other recent new comers from Mexico, Central America, west Africans, etc. etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />What about the Washington Heights neighborhood?&nbsp; Present day it&#039;s an area of mainly Dominican immigrants, but Alan Greenspan (former chairman of the Federal Reserve), and Ruth Westheimer (&quot;Dr. Ruth&quot; the &quot;sex&quot; doctor), lived there in their youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The point here is that neighborhoods change.&nbsp; What would your driver propose should be done?&nbsp; Have government step in and force everyone to live in areas designated by social class?&nbsp; By race?&nbsp; By income?&nbsp; Would he expect government to curtail our freedoms in order to prevent &quot;gringos&quot; from moving to Jackson Heights and &quot;raising the cost of everything&quot;?&nbsp; Remember also, that things go both ways.&nbsp; Just as gentrification is a real phenomena, neighborhoods also go through periods of decline.&nbsp; &quot;Slumification&quot;, &quot;white flight&quot;, etc. etc., those are real phenomena just the same.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot, I&#039;m not supposed to bring up that, I should have paid attention to those Marxist classes I was forced to take as electives in college!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, for the most part, my personal opinion is that &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot; (polite euphemism for &quot;whites&quot;) are for the most part buying co-ops in Jackson Heights, rather than renting.&nbsp; People buying co-ops generally have little impact on the rental market for apartments, these are 2 different market segments.&nbsp; Additionally, &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot; is a pretty broad, general term.&nbsp; Most of the &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot;, or &quot;whites&quot; if we want to be blunt, in my co-op building are retirees, immigrants from eastern Europe, widowers, people of fairly modest means.&nbsp; In fact, 3 of the &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot;, including myself, are married to persons of non-European origins!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, if your driver is being &quot;muscled&quot; by his landlord doing something illegal to get him out of his apartment, there are plenty of organizations and city agencies able to intercede on his behalf, if he&#039;s willing to do the research.&nbsp; But blaming the &quot;gringos&quot; isn&#039;t going to help him or anyone else. <br /><br />The other alternative is for the United States to set up a system like North Korea, where there is no freedom of movement, or any type of freedom, but at least everyone is pretty much equal.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think even your driver is willing to drive down that road!<br />

					Looks like you&#039;re either: <br />1.) Opening your eyes and realizing how the world really works<br />2.) You&#039;ve stopped drinking those cups of &#039;diversity Kool-Aid&#039;<br /><br />I used to believe much of the rhetoric put out by the &#039;diversicrats&#039;, I considered myself one of those &#039;enlightened white liberals&#039; even.&nbsp; But 9/11, along with the wisdom of age (now approaching 40) has helped me see the light.<br /><br />I enjoy learning about foreign cultures, even having friends from other cultures as well (including my wife).&nbsp; <br /><br />However, as you insinuated, people in Jackson Heights for the most part stick to themselves.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen say: a housewife from Bangladesh, a day laborer from Ecuador, a computer programmer from India, a white guy who plays guitar in a rock band, and a banker from Hong Kong sitting in say Lety&#039;s or Dunkin Donuts discussing politics or exchanging their favorite recipes for chicken curry.&nbsp; (And I don&#039;t expect to see it in the new place on 77th nor in Starbuck&#039;s either, when and if they ever make it to JH).&nbsp; <br /><br />Let me also make perfectly clear - Nothing would make me more happy than to see the above scene!&nbsp; But, it&#039;s just not reality. <br /><br />Diversity goes against all of human nature and our hard-wired reptilian brains.&nbsp; Most people prefer the company of others of &#039;like minds&#039;, we don&#039;t want to have to constantly explain our practices/habits to outsiders/foreigners who may not understand why we do the things we do.&nbsp; <br /><br />Type in &#039;Robert Putnam&#039; into Google, and read some of the recent stories about his research.&nbsp; He&#039;s found that neighborhoods with the HIGHEST levels of diversity have the LEAST amount of social trust, even amongst people of the SAME ethnic and/or racial group.&nbsp; In fact, he admitted that he suppressed these findings because he was afraid of how &quot;those on the right (wing)&quot; would use that information.&nbsp; Well, that&#039;s the intellectual equivalent of the Catholic Church suppressing Galileo! <br /><br />
