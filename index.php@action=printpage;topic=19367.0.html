				I noticed a sign in the window of Bamboo House (opposite Foodtown), &quot;Curry Chicken $4.99 + tax to go only&quot;.&nbsp; I ordered and wasn&#039;t expecting very much for $4.99.&nbsp; The chicken was a very large leg, lots of rice and some greens.&nbsp; It was a large portion that was enough for dinner.&nbsp; I was very pleased.&nbsp; Naan to go is $1.00.&nbsp; The wait time was 20 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				They have a yummy and affordable buffet ($8.99) with a menu that changes daily. Very clean interior with cordial and soft-spoken staff, and a cool disco dragon mask on the wall. Can see this place becoming a go-to!

				I have just recently tried Bamboo House, after a friend was staying at my place while I was traveling, he raved about it , and after trying it I understand why :) Everything we ordered was fresh, and tasty, chicken momos, were fabulous, as well as the indian dishes....
