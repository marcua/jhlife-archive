				In the old bodega/grocery space on 37th Avenue, in between Jahn&#039;s and Casa de Los Antojitos is a new sign that reads Mango Rico. I&#039;m intrigued. Does anyone know anything about this place? Will it be a grocer or restaurant?

				I went in today. If I understood the cashier correctly they will be moving everything here, though 82nd St was open today. Very nice to be able to get around in comfort! And the congestion because of the bus stop was ridiculous!

				I generally check them all - Kim, Growing, Lemon, the other one on 82nd I never remember the name, and a couple when I&#039;m in Woodside - since there is often different stuff offered. I haven&#039;t been to Mango Rico much recently because of the difficulty moving around, though it was a regular stop when they were by the closed cinema.

Lots of space and easy to get around. I live just around the corner from this new location, glad they are here. The last two owners had some ok stuff but both had really bad produce. A really close good veggie spot will be really nice.
