				I hadn’t noticed until yesterday that the craft/plant shop located near Lety’s Bakery is no more. It’s been gutted, and there were people doing construction work inside when I looked in. I actually enjoyed seeing the daily outdoor plant arrangements and flowers during the warm weather months. It was also my go to place for small plants. I’ll miss the shop, and am now wondering what‘s coming next.

				The plant shop relocated just a few doors down on the same block, toward Lemon Farm. Smaller space, but looks very nice.

				Happy to read that the plant shop is just relocating. :D Btw, it also seems like the Re-nu Rejuvination place may have closed permanently. Not 100% sure about that, though. I never really saw anyone there even before COVID.

				Walked by the space tonight. Looks like ReNu and the older plant shop space have been gutted and combined. Construction work on a Sunday evening is interesting!! Anyone know what might be coming in here? There’s definitely a budget!

No, actually I looked up the building in the NYC DOB database. It’s actually going to be a dermatologist’s office from what I can glean.&nbsp; But a legit one...not one of these random shady medical practices that crop up on the Avenue.

				And the former hair salon space that&#039;s been empty for years is also going to be a medical practice, I believe. Drug stores and doctor&#039;s offices are taking over. Interesting.

				There also seems to be work going on in the former GNC store at 37th &amp; 76th. <br />No idea what’s planned for the space but it’s always good to see new businesses take over empty storefronts.

				i think the GNC space has to be non-food. i know GNC accepted a huge rent increase to take the space. not sure if it still merits $9000 per month in this climate

				I saw a giant refrigerated case going into the former GNC store last week, so wonder what it can be. Unless it was being removed, and I caught them in a way that it looked like it was going into the store.

You know I often thought that this space would have been better for a place like Farine (RIP). It’s a smaller footprint, has opportunity for cafe seating, and it’s a less open storefront. I sincerely hope it’s a new restaurant or some kind of grocery store to sell European specialty items. We don’t really have that here.

				we actually had the specialty grocer -- in that exact space -- for a number of years. Gourmet Fantasy Foods. but rent increases drove them to a side street (the storefront where El Toum is now) and then out of business it would be great to see someone try again. we have plenty of restaurants, but this would fill a niche
