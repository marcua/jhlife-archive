					I agree.&nbsp; I wish they had tried to build arround it, which would have kept the neighborhood in tact as well.&nbsp; I went to P.S. 89 in Elmhurst, built during the early 1900&#039;s, and they kept the original structure (including the old auditorium) and built a new high-rise behind it where the playground used to be.

					<br />Memories of a mansion: Meet to lament loss of home in Jackson Heights<br />BY Nicholas Hirshon <br />DAILY NEWS WRITER <br /><br />Friday, August 26th 2011, 4:00 AM<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Todd Maisel/NewsSusan Smolin and Peter Mariotti spent yesterday poring over photos and floorplans of a mansion (below) at 74th St. and 34th Ave., recently demolished to make way for a junior high school. On the buffet line at a bustling Indian restaurant in Jackson Heights, Susan Smolin and Peter Mariotti walked past trays of tandoori chicken and samosas, smiling and laughing.<br /><br />Sitting at their table minutes later, they pored over photos of a fallen friend and swapped memories.<br /><br />&quot;Do you remember the bathrooms?&quot; Mariotti asked Smolin, describing elaborate tile murals of flamingos and ships. &quot;Spectacular bathrooms!&quot;<br /><br />Smolin responded with a grin, &quot;We weren&#039;t allowed to go into the bathrooms!&quot;<br /><br />They were talking yesterday as if at the wake for a mansion at 74th St. and 34th Ave., recently demolished to make way for a junior high school.<br /><br />The lunch seemed cathartic for Smolin, whose relatives lived in the home during her childhood, and Mariotti, who long dreamed of making the house his own.<br /><br />Mariotti, 68, agreed to purchase the home for about $1.8million in 2007, hoping to preserve it. But a confusing series of events put it in city hands instead.<br /><br />Smolin&#039;s family, meanwhile, didn&#039;t know the home was endangered until reading a Daily News article in June.<br /><br />But Smolin, 62, is clearly interested in the mansion&#039;s history: She drove two hours yesterday from her home in Pennington, N.J. - partly in the rain - to learn of its downfall from Mariotti.<br /><br />The neo-Tudor home was erected in 1941 and 1942 for Smolin&#039;s great-uncle, Dr. Tobias Watson, and his wife, Lillian, who wrote a fairly successful etiquette book.<br /><br />As a child, Smolin packed into the basement of the grand house with relatives to watch the Watsons&#039; slideshows of trips across Africa, Europe and Russia.<br /><br />She described Lillian as aloof and snooty - so much that she didn&#039;t allow Smolin and her young siblings and cousins into those fancy bathrooms.<br /><br />Mariotti hung on every word.<br /><br />He had placed only one condition on their meeting. He did not want to go by the vacant lot where the mansion had stood, fearing an onset of emotional pain.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m angry at how beautiful things are treated,&quot; he said.<br /><br />For Smolin and her relatives, the destruction of the house has had some positive impact, drawing relatives who had fallen out of touch back into contact.<br /><br />Smolin&#039;s cousin, Alan Eichler, said he was sad the family did not organize a few years earlier and help Mariotti.<br /><br />&quot;I didn&#039;t know anything about the house being in danger,&quot; said Eichler, who was delivered by Dr. Watson at a hospital that once stood across the street from the mansion.<br /><br />At the restaurant yesterday, Mariotti gave Smolin his copies of the home&#039;s original blueprints and negatives of photos he took there between 1997 and 2006.<br /><br />He groaned that he wanted to get rid of them, anyway.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a period of my life that&#039;s finished and over,&quot; Mariotti said. &quot;I can put it to bed and, hopefully not think about it anymore<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/08/26/2011-08-26_memories_of_a_mansion_two_meet_to_lament_loss_of_home_in_jackson_heights.html#ixzz1W9jnvzgE" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/08/26/2011-08-26_memories_of_a_mansion_two_meet_to_lament_loss_of_home_in_jackson_heights.html#ixzz1W9jnvzgE</a>

					The whole Eichler family settled in the Jackson Heights area.&nbsp; My paternal grandmother Sally (Lillian&#039;s mother) eventually settled there as well in a much more modest attached house on 85th St., which still stands.&nbsp; My father lived there with her until he married (at age 42) and he and my mother moved to an apartment in Elmhurst, where I grew up.&nbsp; Uncle Toby delivered all of the babies in the Eichler family, including me, and I was born at Physicians Hospital as I noted.&nbsp; I also went to P.S. 89 and JHS 145 (we had our graduation at the old Boulevard movie theatre--is that still standing?).&nbsp; &nbsp;The Watsons had two children--Richard who went into advertising like his mother and Anita who became a doctor like her father (Richard is deceased, but Anita lives in Palos Verdes, CA.&nbsp; (I&#039;m in Los Angeles).&nbsp; I&#039;ll check for any family photos.&nbsp; There is a children&#039;s etiquette book that Lillian wrote, &quot;Wee Moderns,&quot; which is filled with photos of Richard and Anita acting out the various etiquette lessons, all photographed in the Jackson Heights home.&nbsp; Lillian&#039;s many books are all out of print, but can be found on such sites as eBay and Amazon under either &quot;Lillian Eichler&quot; or &quot;Lillian Eichler Watson.&quot;

					One other interesting thing is Aunt Lillian (who was my father&#039;s sister) was the daughter of Hungarian immigrants and grew up over my grandfather&#039;s cigar factory in East Harlem, alongside the Third Ave. &quot;el&quot; train.&nbsp; &nbsp;She worked her way through college and became a very successful writer, back in the 20&#039;s when women were still new at careers.&nbsp; She married Tobias Watson and together they built their &quot;dream&quot; mansion in Jackson Heights, across from his hospital, where they lived an elegant lifestyle.&nbsp; The office for his private practice was also part of the house, with a separate street entrance.&nbsp; He kept an office nurse on duty, complete with white starched uniform and cap.&nbsp; As a child, whenever I visited the home, I was always intrigued by the private doorway that would lead from the main house into the doctor&#039;s office.&nbsp; &nbsp;A local pediatrician, Dr. Borah, also shared the office and was my family doctor.

					Sadly, this house was built in 1941 by my aunt and uncle, Lillian Eichler and Tobias Watson.&nbsp; Dr. Watson (Uncle Toby) was a noted obstetrician in the Jackson Heights area and was a also a founder of the Physicians Hospital located across the street (also torn down).&nbsp; (He also delivered me!)&nbsp; Aunt Lillian was a noted author, most famous for writing the 20&#039;s bestseller &quot;Book of Etiquette,&quot; which in its time outsold Emily Post.&nbsp; It was their dream home and now sadly, just like them, it is gone...
