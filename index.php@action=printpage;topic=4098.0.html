Temperature is not taken into consideration when issuing a blizzard warning, but the nature of these storms is such that cold air is often present when the other criteria are met. Temperatures are generally below 0 Â°C (32 Â°F).<br /><br />From this and some informal Google sampling, I think inches accumulated has less to do with it as does the speed in which it falls and the strength of the wind pushing it around.

				Hey if he can take the subway and get to work so can the rest of us.... Isn&#039;t that his motto? To bad he forgets that plenty of teachers have to travel into NYC from L.I and Jersey and as a mom just because the roads are plowed that doesn&#039;t mean the sidewalks are clean... Just the walk home from school today was horrible the sidewalks are slushy and slippery and we are expecting the brunt of it tonight and throughout the day tomorrow... Oh well maybe I&#039;m just ranting because I want to sleep in tomorrow haha...

				As I was walking around in the deluge yesterday, I was imagining how much snow it would have been if it had been cold enough - probably around 4 feet!<br /><br />I&#039;m ready for some sun and warm weather now though.
