			 Happy Endings...ahhhh :smitten: <br /><br />I have 2 Sponsor Owned units available if anyone is interested.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is the best way to buy them.....&nbsp; NO BOARD APPROVAL and only 10% Down.   MARLENE...I TOLD YOU, I DON&#039;T CO-BROKE MY SPONSOR UNITS...LOL.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are both 1 bedroom and both renovated (not by me unfortunately!)&nbsp; The renovations are basic but in par with the price.&nbsp; The first in&nbsp; the Historic district on 34th ave between 86th and 87th street facing the front (very pretty view). Its not a big 1 bedroom unit and it has a pullman kitchen. 179k and the price is somewhat negotiable.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other one is on 86th st between 37th ave and Roosevelt.&nbsp; Also renovated but larger facing the side and rear so it is very quiet.&nbsp; It has an eat-in kitchen and the asking is 215k.&nbsp; I also have a JR4 handyman special but I have an offer yesterday and I have been working with the young lady for a few months.&nbsp; She insisted on a &quot;No Bd unit&quot; and she was working with the 10% deposit.&nbsp; She has a child and will need to convert the Jr room into a bedroom.&nbsp; I was honest with her and told her that is she was willing to wait and search she would find it.&nbsp; If this one falls appart I&#039;ll put it in the market next week but I will show it as a back up.<br /><br />SELF PROMOTIONS...LOL&nbsp; ;)... :smiley6600:&nbsp; I began placing the ads yesterday but I will place them with photos today.&nbsp; See Craigslist and search &quot;Louis&quot; in queens real estate or just call me at my cell 917-577-2868.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t get any REAL offers this week I&#039;ll place them in NY times next week as well.&nbsp; Sorry no MLS in my sponsor owned units..I AM SO BADDDDDDDD.&nbsp; If anyone is serious and has been pre-approved I will be happy to show the unit.&nbsp; Sorry, I don&#039;t do open houses but maybe in the future. <br /><br /> &nbsp; What a beautiful couple of days we had...Hope they return soon.<br />&nbsp; [/b]

			SELF PROMOTIONS...LOL&nbsp; ...&nbsp; &nbsp;I began placing the ads yesterday but I will place them with photos today.&nbsp; See Craigslist and search &quot;Louis&quot; in queens real estate or just call me at my cell 917-577-2868.&nbsp; If I don&#039;t get any REAL offers this week I&#039;ll place them in NY times next week as well.&nbsp; Sorry no MLS in my sponsor owned units..I AM SO BADDDDDDDD.&nbsp; If anyone is serious and has been pre-approved I will be happy to show the unit.&nbsp; Sorry, I don&#039;t do open houses but maybe in the future.  <br /><br />LOL.&nbsp; You sound like closings with you are a lot of fun.<br /><br />But I&#039;m still looking for a place in the Greystones, Dunolly, Hawthorne, or close by.&nbsp; Something between 76th and say 81st.&nbsp; I was at a flea market today and one of the vendors said a unit in his Greystone was on the market.&nbsp; (I used to live in one years ago with mom and dad, so I don&#039;t mind the walk up.)<br /><br />You seem to only deal in sponsor units though, but if you have any lines on these locations, let me know.<br />

			TooTrue <br /><br />We only live once...I can argue about anything but not today&nbsp; ::).<br /><br />Yes, I specialize in Sponsor owned units.&nbsp; Can&#039;t deal with the possibility of Bd Approvals.&nbsp; I have served in Boards in Jamaica Estates and Jamaica Hills&nbsp; I have seen what sometimes goes on and it&#039;s not pretty&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I don&#039;t list properties.&nbsp; Most of the coops I sell are units I remodel in Corona or rentals in Astoria.&nbsp; The units in Jackson Heights that I sell for sponsors are usually already fixed by expert &quot;low budget&quot; contractors like superintendents and their cousin Bubba and Pedro... :o.&nbsp; But in all fairness, a simple low budget renovation is better than some of the &quot;handyman&quot; specials I have seen unless the seller tries to triple the return of the renovation project. <br /><br />Take your time and get all that you want.&nbsp; Don&#039;t settle for less than what you want.&nbsp; Make sure you are ready when your dream apartment comes by.&nbsp; Opportunity will knock (I believe...I BELIEVE!!!) and you should have your finances together and a bank ready to cut a check.&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish you lots and lots of good luck and happy coop hunting.\ ;)[/b]

			In the more than 10 years I&#039;ve been Board President, we&#039;ve experienced a few bad managing companies.&nbsp; Never stuck with them longer than a year.&nbsp; And even then they can leave quite a mess behind.&nbsp; But I think they can change, for better or worse, depending on their employees.&nbsp; So I always check recent references.&nbsp; &nbsp;For everything and everyone.&nbsp; It saves a lot of aggravation.
