				Title: <strong>Solicitation</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello everybody! I&#039;m new to Jackson Heights Life and I would really appreciate any insight, advice and help from the hood.&nbsp; <br /><br />Quite recently my building has been experiencing an exponential influx of door-to-door solicitation (it feels like every day of the week.)&nbsp; The nature of solicitation tends to be political, re real-estate, alternative energy (IDT, etc) scammers offering rebates and whatnot.&nbsp; They never used to go beyond ringing doorbells from downstairs but this has progressed to trespassing as in they buzz my doorbell downstairs and take the elevator to my floor and then knock on our door. Our building management has recognized this as a problem and they&#039;ve issued a memo reminding people to never let in people they do not recognize.&nbsp; We&#039;ve written an email to them requesting a &quot;no solicitation&quot;/&quot;no trespassing&quot; but so far nothing&#039;s been done.<br /><br />I am writing this with hopes of some advice as I do understand that solicitation is protected under the 1st Amendment.&nbsp; But let&#039;s be real, it&#039;s a legitimate security issue.&nbsp; Would it be illegal for a tenant to put up a &quot;no solicitation&quot;/&quot;no trespassing&quot; sign?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help with this.

				the first amendment does not protect trespass on private property. they can leave flyers in your public mailbox, but they must be invited in to your building. they do this by buzzing until someone lets them in with fake requests. <br /><br />&nbsp;your halls are private property and these people prey on the ill informed to steal things from them. tell them to leave or you will call the cops. ask who invited them, <strong>then call the cops. </strong><br /><br />seriously. screw these people. they need to learn.

				Our bldg has had an upswing in door-to-door solicitation, as well. All political. A few weeks ago Ocasio-Cortez campaign and Crowley campaign and now Ari Espinal, Jessica Ramos, Jose Peralta campaigns. I don&#039;t answer my door unless I am expecting someone or something, but it is disturbing and unwanted ringing nonetheless.

				It&#039;s not illegal to put up a no solicitation sign. It&#039;s easier to go door to door in &quot;brownstone brooklyn&quot; where there are fewer traditional apartment buildings with intercoms and we had people knocking on our door at least 5 times a day (usually from local spanish-speaking christian churches). Tons of people had signs trying to keep them away - my neighbor had one that said &quot;We are Catholic GO AWAY&quot; because of all of the religious proselytizing. <br /><br />I only ever see the energy scammers in JH and I just tell them to get lost while pretending to call the super. They are persistent but they scurry away as soon as you get stern with them. I don&#039;t answer my door but I sometimes go into the hallway to get rid of them when I hear them because I worry about them bothering the elderly tenants.

				Petitioning for signatures from political campaigns should be over at this point. The campaigns for state and city office had to already submit signatures from registered Democrats (and I guess Republicans though I do not know of any Republicans running for city or state seats) in order to get on the ballot.<br /><br />I did see volunteers from the Ocasio-Cortez campaign in my building the day before the primary going around to registered Democrats doors to remind them to vote (remember, when you register with a party it becomes public record). While I appreciate that it can be annoying especially when combined with energy scammers, religious groups, etc., it&#039;s also a sign of competitive races and efforts to engage an the public in elections that really can make a difference (primaries). <br /><br />(If more people had voted in their state primaries in 2016 - especially the moderate Republicans who were appalled that Trump became their party candidate but ended up voting for him in the general election anyway - I think chances are good we&#039;d have a different Commander in Chief today)
