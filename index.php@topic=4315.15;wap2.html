			One final area code factoid:<br /><br />Area code 718 is a New York City telephone area code (overlaid by area codes 347 and 917) for four out of five boroughs of New York City: the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island; as well as the Marble Hill section of Manhattan.<br /><br />At the time of its creation in 1984, the 718 code was assigned only to Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island; the Bronx joined 718 in 1992. Manhattan cell phones may also use the 718 area code.<br /><br />The 347 area code became effective October 1, 1999[1], as an overlay, which meant that telephone lines which previously had a 718 or 917 area code maintained their number, while the majority of new numbers in the area onward were assigned the 347 area code. The addition of 347 to New York City brings the number of area codes to five: (212, 347, 646, 718, and 917).<br /><br />On December 16, 2009, the New York Public Service Commission approved an additional overlay of the 718/347 area code region[2][3].<br /><br />On January 22, 2010, NeuStar-NANPA issued a press release (through PR-NewsWire) that 929 is to be the new area code to further overlay the New York City &quot;outer boroughs&quot; 718 and 347 area codes[4]. The effective dates for new numbers assigned out of the new 929 area code is still to be announced, but it is expected to be during the first or second quarter of 2011. Ten-digit or 1+ten-digit dialing is already mandatory throughout all of the five boroughs of New York City, so there is no dialing transition phase to go through for this and all future overlays for New York City.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_718

			There was also Olympia. By the way 20th Century Boy, from reading your other posts, I&#039;m sure we went to school together. I graduated 145 in 1966 and Newtown in 1969. <br />I never moved out of the area and am now in one of the Northridge sections.<br />

			Prior to All-Number Calling in the 1960s, these exchanges served Jackson Heights from the telephone building on Broadway in Elmhurst. <br /><br />DEfender 5<br />HAvemeyer 4, 6, &amp; 9<br />HIckory 6<br />ILlinois 7 &amp; 8<br />NEwtown 9<br />TWining 8 &amp; 9<br />OLympia 1<br /><br />These still exist as three-digit exchanges.&nbsp; Between the change from exchange names to all-numbers, the company created &quot;Selected Letter&quot; exchanges (like NR) which had no meaning. LT was in Manhattan, XX in the Bronx.<br /><br /><br />

			My childhood phone number was Illinois 7-0434 from 1951 to 1968. Around that time, they moved away from the name exchanges to all numbers 457-0434. Same difference. I found it slightly ironic that I moved to Chicago (Illinois) in 1972 and stayed there until I moved to Florida in 2009. At least I learned to say &#039;Illinois&#039; (Ill in noy - &quot;There is no &#039;noise&#039; in Illinois&quot;).
