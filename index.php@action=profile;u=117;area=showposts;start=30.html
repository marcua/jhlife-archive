					Went tonight for dinner and they have a pretty typical diner menu.&nbsp; We had&nbsp; french onion soup, chicken quesadilla and a chicken souvlaki platter.&nbsp; The food was all pretty good.&nbsp; Service was pretty slow and we waited about a half hour for the food.&nbsp; The waitress did apologize twice for the slow service explaining it was their first day.&nbsp; A very nice renovation was done inside.&nbsp; It was more crowded at dinner than the Mark Twain used to be but it was only about 40% full.&nbsp; Very encouraging for the first day and will return in couple of weeks when they have some time to iron out the kinks. Open 24/7 and free delivery.

					I second both Shelby2 and DSSJH recommendations.&nbsp; Legends is a little closer and is male-dominated but definitely diverse in every sense of the word.&nbsp; Both straight and gay couples are regulars and people from many different ethnic backgrounds.&nbsp; Age range from 20&#039;s to 60&#039;s (youngest on Friday and Saturday night).&nbsp; In addition to sitting at the bar there are tables in the back and high tables&nbsp; directly across from the bar against the wall.&nbsp; Lots of flat screen TVs.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t feel like walking home Mexicana Car Service is two doors away.

I&#039;ve known a couple of entrepreneurs who&#039;ve started a local business with varying degrees of success. So unless you&#039;re independently wealthy and plan to hire a staff to do all the work, my first suggestion would be to go into the kind of business that YOU want to run. You&#039;d better have a solid business plan, be prepared to work from dawn til dusk (and quite possibly even longer hours) knowing you&#039;ll most likely lose money until you build up a steady clientele. This isn&#039;t something anyone should do on a whim, especially given the start-up costs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I second everything said here.&nbsp; Anyone who is considering opening a business should understand what kind of business they can operate successfully and be prepared to make a large initial investment and be prepared to have trouble making money&nbsp; for the first six months or so while you build a customer base.&nbsp; You also have to have a knowledge base or expertise in the business you run.&nbsp; i think you should first identify the types of business you could run and then see if they are a fit for the neighborhood.&nbsp; For example there may be a need for a Middle Eastern restaurant but do you know anything about Middle eastern food or how to operate a restaurant.&nbsp; Could you operate a pet sore if there is a need but don&#039;t like animals.

All the companies you listed above are presently owned by huge media conglomerates that use their tremendous wealth to lobby members of Congress to enact legislation, or remove regulations, that will allow them to swallow up even more media outlets and become more powerful and profitable. Does that make them &quot;liberal&quot;? It sounds more like the Republican &quot;ideal&quot; of capitalism: buy off the politicians so you can become rich and powerful enough to squash the competition, regardless of whether or not that&#039;s in the public&#039;s best interest. <br /><br />Full disclosure: I can&#039;t watch the FOX propaganda channel for more than 2 minutes without wanting to throw a brick through the TV screen. I regularly read The New York Times (still the best newspaper in this country), The Economist, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and BBC World News (for an international perspective).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Steven,<br /><br />Respectful disagreement is healthy.&nbsp; You may be right about the large networks and maybe my personal sampling of these networks is limited to some of their on air personalities.&nbsp; I was recalling the 2088 presidential election coverage&nbsp; which I was watching with a very politically diverse group and Wolf Blitzer at CNN kept saying &quot;we&quot; won another state whenever Kerry was projected as a winner.&nbsp; Later that night Tom Brokaw seemed devastated (many people were) when Bush won Ohio from Kerry.&nbsp; But as I said my sample size is small and certainly not scientific.<br /><br />I fully agree with you about watching Fox - it&#039;s horrible.&nbsp; I do like BBC and I am not familiar enough with the Economist to comment on it.&nbsp; I used to read the NY Times regularly but I feel they have lost some of their credibility.&nbsp; &nbsp;I actually strongly dislike Olbermann and consider him in the same grouping as O&#039;Reilly but from the other side of the aisle.&nbsp; Since I am an independent and straddle the middle on many topics (I lean left on some topics and right on others) I just want some unbiased reporting and I&#039;m not sure I am getting it anywhere

They bought a house in Bayside several years ago and have two kids in college and they don&#039;t receive any financial aid because of their income and they certainly don&#039;t feel wealthy. What income for a single person or a couple do you find makes them wealthy?<br /><br />I&#039;m an independent and would never register to be a democrat or republican but I never thought of the media as right-wing dominated. &nbsp;I would think ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN all lean left. &nbsp;MSNBC leans far left and Fox leans very far right. &nbsp;Although I don&#039;t read the NY newspapers much anymore since the NY Times went downhill the Times, Newsday and Daily News were always left leaning and the NY Post right leaning. I realize that some AM radio lean far right but to be honest I don&#039;t know the stations and find them unlistenable. &nbsp;Why do you think the media is right-wing dominated?<br /><br />

					Do people ever send postcards anymore?&nbsp; The last one i received was probably in the mid nineties when someone I know traveled out of the country.&nbsp; I know they still sell them because i have seen them when I&#039;m on vacation.&nbsp; I guess they will become obsolete - so sad.&nbsp; I used to save postcards and hand written letters because they were so personal
