				It looks like a tree was knocked down near 73rd St on 35th Avenue.&nbsp; Traffic was being re-directed to 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Avoid the area if you have to go out this morning.

And maybe the road crews will remove the tree soon. That&#039;s what usually occurs.

				&nbsp;Looks like 34th Ave is&nbsp; self patroling today. Lots of vehicular traffic, few walkers and cyclists. Right after a prolonged honking session, it was a full flood of vehicles so walkers, be careful out there!

				Actually I think we need to close the 34th Avenue Open Street until the Parks Department can have arborists come and inspect each and every tree along all 1.6 miles and ensure the safety of every pedestrian and bicyclist.&nbsp; ;)

				&nbsp;Yesterday was actually a triumph of common sense by the community where 34th Ave was used as needed for the vehicular traffic we need daily. It was a beautiful thing to see where sense and sensibility prevailed! While other streets were facing problems and the honking was intermittently loud, people took it upon themselves to open 34th ave to alleviate the jam.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I think this occasional community take back will continue throughout the winter months where use of the open streets goes so much lower and many more folks are in vehicles of some sort - buses, delivery vans, school vehicles, city service vehicles and not so many but some personal vehicles. Usually when a project faces opposition, all parties take a look at what the obstacles might be. The issue here is the denial by open streets advocates that there is any issues with the closure. Many more parents than we would like to admit drop off their children in vehicles for just one example. <br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s see where this goes though...we now have a beautiful new field off Northern Blvd and a promised JH Community Center on the way. Who knows? Maybe we will get our beloved bike lane back instead of the kookiness that happens now with the free for all attitude. It would be much safer for cyclists.

				&nbsp;Funny, I was thinking the same thing! Fanatics are popular in certain areas right now...negotiation not so much. Some don&#039;t trust the vaccines either and are soo convinced they are right. It&#039;s going to take awhile to read the whole community though and that&#039;s post COVID to be sure.
