					&quot;For the same price of an apartment in this neighborhood, you can find equivalent, in terms of size/quality, apartments in quite parts of the city and/or suburbs.&quot;<br /><br />Actually, I&#039;ve lived in my apartment for over 15 years and this is not true. I paid $100K for my apartment.

					Nobody is asking for a monastery or silence, and those who are implying that those of us that do not want to live with constant excessive noise are being disingenuous. When I&#039;m talking about screaming and shrieking in the garden, I&#039;m talking about a noise level that is impossible to ignore with the windows closed, the air conditioner on, and the TV on. This is not the sound of children giggling and playing. And not only do the parents not do anything about it, they actually encourage it - by chasing after them and yelling along with them and starting games that are likely to cause the kids to start screaming. <br /><br />A few additional points:<br />- Having to close one&#039;s windows on a beautiful day interferes with my ability to enjoy my apartment. I bought the apartment for the lovely windows that look out on a garden, and I do not see why I should be robbed of that.&nbsp; <br />-<strong>Dunolly Gardens does not have a playground </strong>or a playspace. Unfortunately, real estate agents lie about this to sell apartments, which is part of the problem. [/b]<br />- I too grew up in the suburbs and it was not &quot;deathly quiet.&quot; We had a backyard. However, when we kids became extremely loud my parents took us to the playground, as we had neighbors on each side and my mother had a sense of responsibility to other people. <br /><br />At Dunolly, we have quiet hours from 10pm until 8am. Any other time you can have kids screaming in the courtyard. Including weekends.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

					Hi, I&#039;m curious if any other of the garden co-ops have designated quiet hours (aside from the usual nighttime hours.)&nbsp; We have had a lot of families with young children move in during the last few years and, unfortunately, some of them are very inconsiderate about using this shared space, letting their kids run around shrieking at the top of their lungs for hours on end. (And, frankly, some parents are obnoxious when politely asked to please either get their kids to quiet down or take them to the playground or playstreet.) One suggestion I would like to bring to the board is the idea of having designated garden quiet hours. For example, on a holiday, quiet hours from 3-7, or on evenings from 6-8, when residents may be having dinner. This allows family time in the garden but also quiet time when other residents can open their windows and enjoy some peace and quiet. <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what others either think of this idea or if other coops have done anything like this. While there is an &quot;excessive noise&quot; clause in the house rules, it is not observed or enforced. (I have tried.)&nbsp; Any thoughts? <br /><br /><br />

					IMO, the rights of current shareholders to protect their investment overrides the rights of prospective shareholders. When you buy into a co-op, you are entering into a business partnership, the success or failure of which has the potential to seriously affect your financial well-being. My concern is that passage of the bill would lead to co-ops only being able to consider the applicant&#039;s finances in making a decision, whereas in most cases we want to consider both finances and whether or not the applicant will be a responsible shareholder.

					I&#039;m definitely in favor of admissions committees giving preference to non-smokers. Given the difficulty some are having in selling their apartments in this economic climate, I would be concerned about any co-op placing yet more restrictions on buyers. <br /><br />I have had issues in the past with the smoke from neighboring apartments entering my apartment, and recently picked up hundreds of cigarette butts from our garden during spring cleanup (idiots throwing cigarette butts into snow, no doubt - do they think they disappear?). I&#039;m about as anti-smoking as you can get. I just wonder about the wisdom of further restricting who can buy at this time.

					Vandalism is vandalism.<br /><br />We live in a city with 8-1/2 million people. In order to live in a civilized manner, we need rules. <br /><br />The difference between corporate advertising and graffiti is not an aesthetic one, it is a legal one. The corporation has permission to post their ads. The vandal does not.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like all laws. Some I find ridiculous. But unless the law results in a human rights violation, I&#039;m in favor of obeying the law. Ultimately the laws protect all of us. I for one would not want to see every inch of public property covered with the scrawlings of anyone who wanted to write anything on them. <br /><br />Call me old-fashioned.

					A lot of the behavior I&#039;ve seen from street bums in the past few months has totally disgusted me. (I use the term &quot;street bums&quot; because to me there is homeless and then there is completely out of control). Nudity, defecation and urination in the street, and yes, tonight I saw a drunk bum physically attack a guy and his girlfriend going into the subway; the couple weren&#039;t from the neighborhood. <br /><br />I donate money to organizations to help the homeless, but my compassion does not extend to being ok with drunk, disorderly, and threatning, out of control behavior on the streets of my neighborhood. Very often these guys are particularly threatening towards women, and if you work late hours like I do, that can be very disconcerting.
