				Some claim that the popular TV series was about a dysfunctional family which lived in Astoria but the events took place, in the mid-60&#039;s, on 85th St. between 31st and 32nd Ave. in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Archie was Mickey (Michael) Morse who worked for the NYC Sewer Department (much like &#039;Norton&#039; of Jackie Gleason fame). The other cast members were; his wife, Bea (Beatrice), his daughter, Linda, and Linda&#039;s husband, Steve, who took the part of &#039;meathead.&#039; At a certain point Steve disappeared and was never heard from again. None of us ever found out what happened to him.<br /><br />Bea&#039;s sister, Mimi, was witness to it all and happened to know a TV producer whose interest was piqued by her descriptions of, as she called it, &quot;mayhem at the Morse&#039;s.&quot; The series finally ran as a popular U.S. TV show after first showing as a British version throughout the U.K.<br /><br />All of the participants are now dead but some of us remember them. &nbsp;Do you?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Can&#039;t say I knew them but they must have been a bunch of characters.<br /><br />I do remember the show however. During the opening song, &quot;Those Were the Days,&quot; they ran neighborhood street footage. Those homes looked alot like a typical street in Elmhurst.

				what a wonderful remembrance!<br /><br />the opening was actually shot in glendale...the exact house used for exteriors was/is on cooper avenue. as it&#039;s a private residence, i doubt that the owners want extra people coming down to visit ... an ex of mine lived on the block in astoria where the costanza family house was often shown on seinfeld. we considered buying another house on that block before eventually buying a house here in JH....

				Wow, this is all news to me and very interesting!&nbsp; Thanks for posting. I always wondered where those houses were (in the opening shots of Archie Bunker) and it&#039;s so great to know the show was based on a JH family.

				I thought the Bunkers lived at 704 Hauser (fictional) street....<br /><br />**update** Oh - now I see - the family upon whose lives the show was based lived on 85th Street...my mistake.
