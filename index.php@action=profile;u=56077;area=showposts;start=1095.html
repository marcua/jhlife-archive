					Well the only studios in coops entering that range are those two. And that seems like a very strange choice on the listing agent&#039;s part for the one in the Carlton House given that it appears the last studio sold in the building (pending anyway) had the asking price dropped by $16K to $184. Admittedly, the photos look like the one in Carlton House has been updated nicely. And it&#039;s a sponsor unit, so no board approval. Is that worth a premium of $60K? I guess the realtor will find out. I really wouldn&#039;t put too much credence on the asking price of a luxury condo being $259. Condos aren&#039;t coops, and they always cost a lot more.

					There&#039;s way more studios in the $130-165K price range than over $200K. Looking at what has recently sold on Realtor.com, most are $140-170K. One appears to be a condo that sold for $277K, but it&#039;s a condo and they always cost more, and the Andrew Jackson has a 24 hour door man and a pool. So, consider that building more of a luxury building.<br /><br />There was another studio listed at Carlton house for originally $200K-ish. Carlton House has a part-time doorman and a garden, so I can certainly see why a studio there is going to run more than one of the post-war buildings that don&#039;t have a garden. But, it&#039;s interesting to note that listing is now &quot;pending&quot; with a price reduction down to $184K. <br /><br />The only other studio listed as sold on Realtor.com is a mistake. It&#039;s in Roosevelt Terrace for $205, and that was a one bedroom.<br />

					prostitution =/= human trafficing. I have no doubt some prostitutes are forced in to it, but I also have no doubt some sex workers do it for a lot of other reasons. It&#039;s just way easier on middle class folks to point to prostitutes rather than the maids, gardeners, manicurists, prep cooks, etc. they encounter daily.

					Mr Flannel works in food, and swears by the lady at Chelsea Market. If people have good experiences of others, I&#039;d love to hear, especially closer to JH. But, one bad sharpening can really ruin the effectiveness of a good knife and shorten it&#039;s lifespan. A German style knife that loses it&#039;s curve lousy for mincing, for example.

					Exactly where did anyone even remotely suggest making JH a haven for the homeless and mentally ill? <br /><br />Christ on a cracker, people are reminding others that the homeless and the mentally ill are human beings worthy of our respect, and if it&#039;s too much for people to see someone down on their luck take a load off at the post office benches, that person should seriously do some soul-searching, because that&#039;s just a really, really awful character trait.<br /><br />Maybe we should do what was done a century ago and round up all the undesirables and ship them off to one of the islands at institutions that were rife with abuse? And I&#039;ll be honest, I think in-hospital treatment at a psychiatric hospital is usually better for the patients and their families, with non-violent and stable patients granted passes to leave the facilities, than halfway homes. But in a place like NYC, those hospitals -- if we start going that way again -- are in someone&#039;s neighborhood.

					Pamphlets? No Thanks. A singing group in a largely commercial area? Okay, maybe it&#039;s even nice to listen to a bit. My grandmother loved &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot; so when I hear it it reminds me of her. Maybe those tunes they sing are giving other people good memories. <br /><br />But the PAs...OMG. I was taking a bus from Junction over to the mall in Rego Park, and was waiting and waiting for the bus. Someone on the corner was going on and on about El Senor in Spanish. I had to endure 30 minutes as I waited and waited. And there&#039;s apartment buildings there! Listening to it was like listening to a carnival barker, except worse because I don&#039;t speak Spanish. I don&#039;t know, maybe it&#039;s better I don&#039;t know Spanish! At least at a carnival you can get away from the barker. He&#039;s only a passing thing.<br /><br />I called 311 to register a noise complaint.

					I&#039;m not exactly sure which local store -- beyond maybe one women&#039;s shop on 37th Avenue (by the liquor store I think) -- would possibly lose customers to a Banana Republic factory store. And even that women&#039;s shop is questionable as the clothing there seems to be for a decidedly mature customer.<br /><br />We don&#039;t have great clothing stores in this neighborhood. Want a dress that&#039;s 100% polyester, ill fitting, and sure to pill up in two washings? Looking for horrific patterns? You got it. <br /><br />One good thing I&#039;d say about ABC Outlet clothing selection is that if you browse frequently, you can sometimes find good stuff. I still have Danskin capri workout pants I spotted at there, and am routinely saddened that I lost a second pair I left in a gym bag on the train. I&#039;ll buy some of the light sleeping shorts there and an after shower mumu. But I haven&#039;t found anything decent clothes to wear outside the house wise there is years.<br /><br />On another note, I visited the new location of ABC on Junction the other day. What a difference! Two floors, with home stuff upstairs. I imagine it&#039;s only a matter of time before they add racks and pack the first floor just as badly as it was on 82nd (and on Greenpoint), but since I mostly pick up a couple home items there, it was paradise.

					I guess the folks in this avenue haven&#039;t been down to the decent sized natural food store on 37th Avenue between 85th &amp; 84th. There&#039;s a couple of bars that look like they&#039;d serve bloody mary&#039;s on Northern. I&#039;d be all for a couple brunch spots. The weird thing in this neighborhood is that it seems like almost every restaurant has a TV. Why? It is so annoying and distracting.

					I don&#039;t get this perception that the block that the post office is on is *seedy* What&#039;s the worse you can say about that area? One of the benches needs to be painted. Apparently weeding the little garden area in front of the post office (which BTW has shrubbery) isn&#039;t a high priority to the USPS, but no surprise there.&nbsp; <br /><br />You&#039;d think people were smoking crack, the area was littered with hypodermic needles, and there were strung-out street walkers picking up johns on the corner.

					Why shouldn&#039;t the homeless be able to sit down and take a load off? Seriously, they are human beings too. It sounds like OP just doesn&#039;t want to have to see them because it makes the OP uncomfortable to have to see the homeless.<br /><br />I&#039;ve met people in Jackson Heights who live in a building without garden space. There&#039;s plenty of them. For them, any space that allows them to just sit outdoors is welcome. Whether it&#039;s the post office, one of the church&#039;s with a garden open to the pubic, or Traver&#039;s Park, it&#039;s very welcome.<br /><br />

					The problem with Blink isn&#039;t that it&#039;s busy during the times you&#039;d expect it to be busy - after work hours - it&#039;s that it&#039;s *always* busy. And it&#039;s not a bit crowded, it&#039;s like insanely crowded. I&#039;ve tried mostly going at off-peak hours. It&#039;s busy then. At peak hours, it&#039;s nuts. They need to limit new memberships. It&#039;s actually really easy to do without flat out refusing to accept new members. You just raise the initiation fee to a level that discourages new members to join. Then when you have member atrophy, you drop the fee to encourage new members. <br /><br />And there&#039;s a lot of members who know nothing about gym etiquette, and the staff can really only do so much. Take note when you&#039;re there. There will be free weights just laying around the gym. Some of the members don&#039;t know (or don&#039;t care)&nbsp; that you&#039;re supposed to put free weights back on the racks. The people who work there can only do so much (and why should they have to lug around heavy free weights all day?). Part of the problem is also the folks who lounge around on the weight machines. You&#039;d think those lounging folks might notice others are waiting to use the machines, but if you don&#039;t ask to work in, most people won&#039;t offer. And unfortunately, some members have flat out refused my requests to work in. The worst part is, management&#039;s official response is &quot;we don&#039;t mandate that members share equipment or set time limits on the equipment.&quot; So, Blink is tots fine with setting up on the leg press for as long as it takes for as many sets as you plan to do -- whehter it&#039;s five minutes, 10, or 30, and refusing to let others work in a set.<br /><br />Executive Fitness is down on 87th Avenue and Roosevelt. It&#039;s way smaller, but does have a decent sized studio for stretching/abs.&nbsp; The AC isn&#039;t working there yet, though they have set up portables. Front desk says members are expected to let others work in on the weight machines. Anyone know anything about it?

					Unfortunately, bike storage at RT is pretty limited. Technically, yes it is available, but I think there is a huge waiting list with very limited space.<br /><br />
