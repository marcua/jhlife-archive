				With all the controversy across the street, Foodtown picked up alot of extra shoppers. They expanded their hours and something also needed to be done about the long check out lines. So several weeks ago they installed self checkout lanes.<br /><br />Does it really help? Is it a way of saving on payroll with new increased hours?<br /><br />I had heard several complaints about them not working properly. I kind of figured some people weren&#039;t use to using such things. I had used them in other stores. Then I tried Foodtown&#039;s and sure enough the thing jammed up in the middle of my checkout.<br /><br />The attendant didn&#039;t know what to do about my partial change given and called the manager. He didn&#039;t seem to know what to do either even though the machine was giving instructions. He borrowed cash change from another live cashier to give to me. I guess they figured it out later.<br /><br />What do you think of these machines?<br />&nbsp;

				Don&#039;t like them. I don&#039;t know how many cashiers they displaced or intend to displace. The machines don&#039;t understand self-bagging or more than one bag. I find myself swearing at them because they are machines that invariably act irrationally; I don&#039;t swear at people (unless there is a vehicle involved). Now I&#039;ll just get on line and wait because I find that less frustrating.

				I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; They&#039;ve worked fine for me but I&#039;m also very used to the quirks of the machines from using them in other places.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t doubt they go down or mess up.&nbsp; Both times I&#039;ve needed to void something, it was quickly done - and they were my mistakes.&nbsp; I prefer having the option there because the lines have been really long otherwise and I also think the extended hours have helped considerably. I think it&#039;s good to have both options and then folks can choose what they want to do.

				I&#039;m not a fan of the self-checkout, but I have used it several times when I&#039;ve stopped in for just a handful of items. <br /><br />A few things to consider: <br />1. Purchasing alcoholic beverages requires an employee to verify your age and swipe their card in the scanner to authorize it; <br />2. Buying fresh produce requires you to find the item in a menu on screen, which can be time consuming; <br />3. The machines can be fussy when paying with cash, much to the annoyance of anyone behind you in line.<br /><br />(I actually don&#039;t mind bagging my own groceries, as I don&#039;t use nearly as many plastic bags as Foodtown&#039;s packers usually do, which has always been a pet peeve of mine.)

				I looked, and wondered.<br /><br />I suppose it must be set up to recognize and apply the club card discounts, but is there any way it could apply the senior discount?<br /><br />And can it give cash back?<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve wimped out of trying.<br /><br /><br />

It&#039;s faster. If you&#039;re buying beer there&#039;s always a person manning the 4 registers so it&#039;s not been an issue for me yet.<br /><br />1. You can scan the club card first off before you scan your items<br />2. It will give you up to $20 cash back (two 10s&#039;), same as the regular register.<br /><br />Shrug. I still go to the normal register at times, but I go to the self-checkout more often than not.

				I&#039;ve tried Foodtown&#039;s self checkout three times and quite honestly, I hate it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used self-checkout in other stores, like Lowe&#039;s or Home Depot and not had any trouble, but for some reason, it&#039;s a nightmare at Foodtown....and forget about using it if you have produce!

				it&#039;s easy enough, but i don&#039;t like it because it means putting people out of work. <br /><br />it&#039;ll save money for store management, who will axe workers to generate savings that will never be passed down to customers.

				It looks like it only replaced one register (max two) that were replaced by a person that is there to look over everything.<br /><br />I somehow doubt they let anyone go as a consequence of bringing them in, if anything it&#039;s getting people with a few items out the door faster.

				they took out two human-manned registers and put in four or six self checkouts. to be honest, i&#039;m not sure if they let anyone go or not. i&#039;d imagine they probably did...there&#039;d be no financial incentive to spend the money on the new checkouts and still kept the same number of clerks to handle fewer registers -- at the very least, they had to cut their hours, since there&#039;d be no place to put them....

I liked this Foodtown at first but now I hate it. It&#039;s dirty, crowded, there are carts and baskets clogging the front when it&#039;s busy because they don&#039;t have as many of those guys who clean up after people and the prices are higher.&nbsp; The only thing better than when it was the Met is the selection. I don&#039;t want to patronize Trade Fair so I guess I&#039;m stuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dream about having a real, suburban supermarket in the hood like other people dream about having a bistro. You know, the type with a huge selection of everything, a real bakery/deli, and wide aisles. I really need to relearn how to drive so I can rent a car once in a while and go to a nice, big fancy supermarket.&nbsp; I was just away for a few weeks in a town with a Publix and I want one here!&nbsp;

				we went to the food bazaar on northern, which is everything positive you&#039;re looking for, plus about seven long aisles of ethnic foods separated by country of origin. it&#039;s a quick walk from the R to get there, and we hailed a cab to get us back, loaded down with groceries, for ten bucks (plus a nice tip, since the guy helped us load and unload). so worth it.

				Oh my goodness, count me in the minority here. I cant believe it took *this* long to realize you need self checkout in this store. I had just about written off this store because of the RIDICULOUS staff slowness and inefficiency, the resulting long lines, failure to have a dedicated line for people getting their groceries delivered, getting caught behind countless people that can never seem to figure out how to get their cash out of their wallets in under 10 minutes (like its an eternal mystery that you need to pay after all of your groceries are scanned), etc etc. The last straw was when a checkout woman was so rude to me I vowed never to return (completely ignored me, threw my receipt at me, even though I said &quot;Hi How are you&quot; &quot;Have a nice day&quot;)..like i wasn&#039;t even there.&nbsp; Because of the great new self check area, I now go regularly after work, am able to pick up a few items, scan, bag and GET OUT OF THERE in a normal amount of time -- and without being insulted by a cashier.&nbsp; <br />*and they do have staff to help people through the self check in case scanning problems arise.
