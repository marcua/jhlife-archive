				I was blocked by the NY Times from reviewing the article.&nbsp; However, it doesn&#039;t matter since I looked at the listing 3 weeks ago when it was listed on Streeteasy.&nbsp; The apartment is magnificent.&nbsp;

				The apartment looks really small.&nbsp; I am guessing that it&#039;s a bit overpriced.

				JDinJH.&nbsp; I just reviewed the floor plan and its 950 SF.&nbsp; At $698,500 it comes to $735 SF.&nbsp; The kitchen is a small open 8&#039; x 5&#039; which is what you would expect to find in a studio.&nbsp; I would agree with your observation about size and price.&nbsp; I was also like to mention that the apartment may have been priced by the owner who is testing the market and not the realtor.&nbsp;

				Kind of strange how the &quot;Dining room&quot; is actually a &quot;Foyer&quot;. I guess because it&#039;s attached to a &quot;kitchen&quot;? <br /><br /><br />Other than that awkardness, looks nice. Great location

				my foyer was advertised as a dining room. i doubt that it&#039;s been used for dining at any point in the 80 years of the building&#039;s existence.<br /><br />that said, this is a very nice apartment.

				That&#039;s a good-looking 2 Br. I hope they get their price. The living room is the typical large living room for our hood, so I think if it were mine, I&#039;d figure out how to use some of the foyer space to extend the kitchen.
