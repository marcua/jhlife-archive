					“ Another said that for AOC, &#039;legislation was never her focus. It was media and narrative.”<br /><br />Truer words have never been spoken. It’s not really comedy gold...the problem with AOC is that she is can be obnoxious and doesn’t seem to work well with her colleagues. If she doesn’t get more savvy to the system, then she’ll never be effective. Sadly, career politicians know how to play this game. With experience, she will learn too.<br /><br />I’m just going to go ahead and say that personally, I am not a fan of AOC at all. She is all theatrics and drama all the time. I feel to my core that she loves the media attention more than she actually cares about the job or this community. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" />

					I still think that if enough of us call and make our voices heard, there will need to be a response. It&#039;s easy enough to write off one or two complaints, but we need to be a unified force. I think this includes regular calls/emails to:<br /><br />1. Elected Officials: Danny Dromm, Catalina Cruz, Jessica Ramos<br />2. Our community Board (who ironically is based in the building on 82nd street right across from the encampment)<br />3. The City (311)<br />4. The 115 (even though they don&#039;t bother to do much)<br />5. The Burger King Building Owner (there&#039;s a # to call on the building on a For Rent sign, this may be realtor, but I don&#039;t doubt if they start getting a lot of calls, they may take some action)<br /><br />For the record, I am neither anti immigrant or anti poor. I want a better quality of life for us all - this includes a safe and clean neighborhood and adequate services for the unhoused.

She also camps in the Apple Bank from time to time. There is also a growing circle of men who have camped on the corner of 82nd and 37th in front of the bank. They have sleeping bags and food and drink so it seems that they are planning, if that&#039;s the right word, to remain there for a while. They are not masked and they are not socially distant. Are the politicians of this community who seem to be endlessly self-promoting doing anything about this?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not to mention, these men literally urinate and defecate openly on the street. It’s so absolutely disgusting - one morning I was walking down the street by the Renaissance Charter School’s back entrance and there was a fresh “offering” that I know was left by one of those guys. They are belligerent and drink all day. I’ve called the 115th precinct and also used the 311 app. I saw the 115 out there telling them to move along the other day, but once they left all the dudes came back. <br /><br />So, the only thing left to do is call the building property manager with the phone number on the window. Ultimately, it’s the building owner’s responsibility to manage their property. I suggest that multiple people do this so that action will be taken.

It&#039;ll be interesting to see if that lasts past COVID.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh believe me, I get it! I hardly ever eat out anymore. And I’m not hating on MR. I actually shop there often. It’s just an interesting spot to choose bc that corner has a high concentration of similar grocers.<br /><br />I don’t know if this is going to happen (prob not), but, personally, I would LOVE if MR did something a little different with this space and maybe included a small juice bar in addition to being a grocer. It could work for them. And aside from Just Made, there aren’t a lot of juice bars on 37th ave unless you go higher up in the 90s. I’d be 100% here for that!!

					I like Mango Rico and all and I shop there, but omg. How many fruit places and grocers do we need?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /> Between the two supermarkets, growing farm, lemon farm, Kim’s brother, and the junky supermarket in the Farine space, that corner is saturated. <br /><br />Between hair salons, pharmacies, bakeries, and now fruit stands, I just really wish we had some more variety on 37th Avenue. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" />

You know I often thought that this space would have been better for a place like Farine (RIP). It’s a smaller footprint, has opportunity for cafe seating, and it’s a less open storefront. I sincerely hope it’s a new restaurant or some kind of grocery store to sell European specialty items. We don’t really have that here.

If we want to change the condition of Diversity Plaza, we will also need to do something about Roosevelt Ave, and 82nd Street. This will involve not accepting, or rationalizing, most of the degenerative behavior that contributes to many of the problems in the neighborhood. We need to come together and constantly complain loudly about the gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes, overcrowding, spitting on the street, etc (and before anyone starts telling me to move back to Ohio, I was born here, in Jackson Heights and never left NYC). <br /><br />A good start would be to pressure, en masse, a clean sweep of Roosevelt starting with shutting down all of the bars on Roosevelt between 75th and Junction. We all know what these places are like. In short, if a bar or restaurant is attracting a clientele that requires security, it should be shut down.<br /><br />We also need to crack down on the groups of drunks who have started populating various street corners. They harass women, start fights, and are generally not contributing anything to the community.<br /><br />We can be in control. We just need to be willing to take action and pressure our elected officials who tend to be overly sympathetic to the people who are contributing to the poor quality of life in our corner of the world.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I 1000% agree. Since moving here years ago (and yes, I am a native New Yorker too), Roosevelt Avenue has been one of the biggest disappointments to the neighborhood. A BID would have gone a long way, but apparently that was heavily contested too. Go figure. <br /><br />Diversity Plaza to me is just plain meh. It could be a heck of a lot nicer (it&#039;s never going to be a beauty) if it wasn&#039;t so crowded and dirty all the time. I have personally called and complained every which way from Sunday to Danny Dromm and the other elected officials about these issues and have not gotten much of a response. I think if we were to call, en masse, with a united message, it could have more weight (versus one person). <br /><br />Recently, I have been spending more time outside of the city (NOT, btw, in an affluent suburb) and have seen first-hand how people who invest in and care for a community can really transform it for the better. How common courtesy amongst citizens, business owners who are deeply rooted to/invested in the community, community-oriented policies, and active public services make a huge impact. We need active community members across all walks of life who care about quality of life issues to come together.&nbsp; That includes: speaking up at town halls, attending community board meetings, writing consistently to local elected officials/city council. <br /><br />For example, I agree, it is BEYOND ME how CB3 always approves new liquor licenses on Roosevelt. Does our CB even live in the neighborhood? Are they aware of the major issues on the avenue?

Unfortunately, being the squeaky wheel is sometimes the only way to get things done.

					I have to say, this article did make me a little emotional. I really am so proud and so grateful for this community. I went out to dinner in Manhattan last night for the first time and it was such a stark and bleak contrast to the vibrancy and life I see every day in this neighborhood.
