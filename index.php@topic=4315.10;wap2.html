One night, only a year or two ago, I decided to dial that number. I was bored and it was a ridiculous thing to do but I did it anyway. The female voice which answered spoke to me in a foreign language and so I apologized -- in English -- and put the phone down. Silly of me.<br /><br />Anyone else ever do such a stupid thing?&nbsp;

			Wow, I went to look up to see when 718 actually began, and discovered this:<br /><br />An additional area code (929) has been assigned to the existing 718 and 347 area codes that serve the outer boroughs of New York City - namely the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.&nbsp; The dialing pattern, which is already in effect in the New York City area, requires all local calls within and between the 718 and 347 area codes and the new 929 area code to be dialed by using 1+10 digit dialing.&nbsp; Existing 718 and 347 telephone numbers will not change.<br /><br />NeuStar Inc., which serves in the capacity as the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), has forecasted that numbering resources in the 718 and 347 area codes will exhaust by 2012.  <br />http://www.askpsc.com/askpsc/page/?PageAction=renderPageById&amp;PageId=3c3e4c3956f92d9c1515975795cea0e1<br /><br />If it&#039;s old news for some, I didn&#039;t know anyway.
