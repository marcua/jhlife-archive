				Sorry to inform you, but it isn&#039;t your parking space; residents don&#039;t actually own the 12 feet under their vehicles.&nbsp; Street parking is a privilege, not a right. <br /><br />When studies show that cars have a 95% non-usage rate, car sharing seems like a better way to leverage the resources of our community for the benefit of more residents.<br /><br />http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html

				I understand that car owners do not own the space beneath them, but I have problems when that space is used to provide profit for private industry. Yes, some people will benefit, people who pay costs and fees to the private car rental service because they choose to use their service instead of public buses or trains. Car sharing rentals are already available at the public garages on 37th Ave and on 88th and Northern at that new garage. I fail to see how displacing current car owners to give space to a private industry that provides a negligible, duplicative, benefit will decrease cars circling for spots. Perhaps it would make sense if the neighborhood was transient enough to have enough new people constantly moving in that might choose to not move with a car on a regular basis. I&#039;m not sure that JH is at that spot. Of the 14 spots on the pilot survey, 10 are areas that are rapidly gentrifying. This seems to encourage that process and churn.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see this service as serving the same public good as Citibike, which I feel is a justifiable yield of space. It feels like a giveaway of a public good. While drivers do not own the street they park on, their taxes pay for it. Why should they be excluded from the use of that space for the benefit of a private company?&nbsp; I had a similar complaint when my street was blocked off for filming in Astoria 25 weeks out of the year to benefit a school that rented out its space to every TV show and movie that needed school interiors (St John&#039;s Prep). It was infuriating and of no benefit to the people who had to put up with the lights, people, and trucks belching exhaust in our windows all day. Someone got paid, though, and that was all that mattered.

				&nbsp;Absolutely love this! Have used the car shares in the neighborhood (zipcar) and loved it for a contract job with the city. <br />We still need and use our family car but can forecast the day when that is no longer necessary. If this program was <br />more available, we would accelerate the elimination of our vehicle as the neighborhood parking has gotten tougher. <br />The carshare could be serviced a bit better and cleaned more often but generally they were great. Riding a jeep one<br />day and mini the next, keeps you energized and alert as a driver. Had only one issue when the street was blocked <br />on 71st St because of prayer services for EID and I missed a half day of work finding an alternative.<br />&nbsp; Many of our neighbors barely use their vehicles as far as I can tell but we also don&#039;t want to free up parking for all<br />of Long Island to use our spots while they take our subway too - solution, resident parking stickers please!!

We don&#039;t always use them, but it&#039;s definitely nice to have the option. We should be moving towards a transportation model that is equitable for the most amount of people in a urban setting such as ours. Space is only going to get tighter. That&#039;s not to say we need to remove all parking. But we should be looking at what the future of transportation will be, and planning around that. Not exclusively gripping to a model that simply isn&#039;t sustainable in the long arc of history. It should be &quot;yes, and.&quot; Yes, private parking AND space for car sharing — which in aggregate benefits more people over the course of a day than a single parking spot with one person&#039;s car.

				I also think that there is a chance that some current auto owners may &#039;give up&#039; their cars when it&#039;s time to get rid of them.&nbsp; I read recently that people with two cars are downsizing to one, and that others with one car with opting to rely on Uber or car sharing services instead.&nbsp; If that is true we may see some relief on parking overall.&nbsp; <br />This is the future.

				I&#039;m not completely against the carshare plan, but a better use of this space, especially in a dense neighborhood like JH, would be to expand Citibike stations here. Does anyone know if this is ever going to happen? It does seems like in order to expand further out in the boroughs that they might need to extend the 45 minute ride time that&#039;s included in the base price. Still, it is infinitely frustrating that the bike share program only goes to LIC. <br /><br />Current Jackson Heights Zipcar users: do you find it difficult to rent cars in the neighborhood right now on the weekends?&nbsp; (I used to have this problem while living elsewhere in NYC.) Would additional rideshare services like this one be useful to address the demand? <br />

				interesting point, but the notion that they&#039;d have to extend the time frame presumes that you need to make a trip into manhattan to make a checkout worthwhile. i know people who&#039;d use the bike for other reasons - even just getting to a restaurant or something in LIC/Astoria/Greenpoint (or to flushing meadow, if they put stations there, eventually).

				Fair enough point - the more I think about it, I would use Citibike at least a few times a month to get to Astoria. So why are they taking so long? Too bad we can&#039;t swap out this rideshare test run with a Citibike kiosk...&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Our entire transportation system is heavily subsidized.&nbsp; <br /><br />Car owners who park and drive on the streets for free are subsidized.&nbsp; Public transit passengers are subsidized.&nbsp; Even &quot;subscribers&quot; of private services like ZipCar and Citibike are subsidized because they are not paying for the use of the streets as part of their cost of travel.<br /><br />This proposal would take a space that one neighborhood resident uses to store their vehicle for days at a time, and lease it to a mobility service open to anyone in the neighborhood.&nbsp; That one parking space will benefit many more people over the course of a day than one space typically does.<br /><br />Leasing of a few on-street parking spaces for car share companies has been tried in Washington, DC, Northern Virginia, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston and other cities, and has proven to be a popular and successful strategy.&nbsp; I&#039;m definitely for it.

				These cars will be used much more often than personal cars, so it&#039;ll be much more efficient use of spaces.<br /><br /><br />Regarding citibike - I don&#039;t think it will ever come here. They are pretty much done expanding and are getting no assistance from the government. However... dockless bicycle sharing is going to be in NYC very soon. It&#039;s messy but more democratic. Not sure the specifics but it&#039;s frankly the only way we will get any.

				&nbsp;I remember hearing some years ago in the early Citibike stages that we were asked about participation. And the thinking<br />at the time seemed to be that serious cyclists going to Manhattan from JH had their own bikes. And no where else closer<br />by - like Astoria or Flushing or Sunnyside- was even mentioned. If it was proposed in a map or circular radius style where <br />you would cycle to from here in the time frame, it may be worth going back to them?

				Readers of this thread may be interested to know that recently members of Queens Bike were contacted by the DOT for input. A program called the Big Drop will examine transportation options for the entire borough of Queens over the next three years. They competed for a grant and NY was one of the cities that won. <br /><br />There will be a meeting in September to start discussion on the issues. I assume it will be announced publicly but will provide more info to this forum when I have it. <br /><br />Biking is not the only issue on the agenda: safe and affordable transportation overall is the desired outcome.

				Is the original post about car share or bike share? <br />I support both. We go to LGA to rent cars about once every three months. Its affordable and easy enough, but we often end up paying for an extra day when we only need a few extra hours. I remember in the car share proposal that cars would be parked in the neighborhood and parking spots would be allocated exclusively for those cars. <br /><br />As for bike share..here are some trips I&#039;d make regularly. I own and ride a bike but there are days when a one way bike trip is better. Such as going to drink/have dinner. Biking there, train home is better. <br /><br />Trips up and down Queens Blvd, to shopping and appointments<br />Downtown Flushing<br />Any library<br />School meetings<br />LIC YMCA. <br />Groceries in Astoria<br />Bookshop in Astoria<br />Bagel shops in Astoria<br />Good bars in Astoria (we need some Astoria businesses here)<br />Glendale, Maspeth, Ridgewood<br />Sunnyside, woodside- lots of old school, small town businesses that are worth the trip. <br />Greenpoint<br />Trader Joes on Metropolitan<br />And most important----- As a connection and backup to the E,F,G,M,R trains that often have delays. <br />If one were able to use a metrocard to hop on a Citibike, we&#039;d see expansion and an increase in ridership like never before. (or like the transit strike of 2005).

				&nbsp;Great list there Miss Marty. I do see Citibikes now over in Astoria near the R stop on Steinway and at Queensbridge houses.<br />&nbsp;Both places I would bike to but maybe not home. Like the idea of having a Citibike pass to hop off a slow subway and take<br />wheels for the rest of the trip.

				In theory I&#039;d love to have Citibike in JH but given the way people drive in this neighborhood, I&#039;m sure they&#039;re going to be very hostile to cyclists. Also, I would imagine that the docks would have to be a bit far from the train.<br /><br />There&#039;s also Car2go which is a car share with only tiny cars. Not super practical for family. I would think that having a car share would reduce the need to own a car for many people (as long as there are enough to go around which I imagine would take awhile to calibrate).

				&nbsp;I think that a bike sharing set up could be on the side of the Medical offices on the corner of Roosevelt and 73rd Road. Also on 72nd street between Roosevelt and Broadway opposite Tawa and the new Towers being built.

				Back in May of 2017 my car finally died.&nbsp; For a few weeks I got by with Uber &amp; Zipcar.&nbsp; Ultimately we decided to buy a car, mostly because we already had a fantastic parking spot right down the block.&nbsp; I think we would embrace a bike share for a trip to Astoria -on a nice day..&nbsp; I was not happy with the Zipcar experience, you cannot be spontaneous, and traffic really impacts the clock ticking..&nbsp;

				34th Avenue - well, at least that&#039;s far enough from the main commercial strip that it won&#039;t impact businesses.&nbsp; Plus, those areas are mostly single family, as opposed to the buildings between 35th and 37th.

				How is the DOT enforcing Zipcar only parking at the designated areas? Is it solely by ticketing non-Zipcars? I recently saw a regular car parked in one of the designated spaces, so when the Zipcar arrived, the driver parked the car near the space, but blocking the crosswalk. It remained like that throughout the day.

				In an ideal world, residents would park their private vehicles in their own off street parking (whether it be their driveway or in a private garage) while street parking would be for those travelling/commuting from other areas.&nbsp; Of course, this won&#039;t happen.&nbsp; If NYC is to reduce the number of private vehicles and/or reduce congestion, other public transport modes must be expanded and improved.&nbsp; The current system seems to be in near chaos.

				This is a silly idea of having special areas where only a zip car can park. It is a giveaway of public resources to a private enterprise. What about the disabled and elderly that own cars? Why should the city make rules to prevent them from having a car? Do we really expect these people to use bicycles?

				as a non-driver -- never had a license due to vision restrictions and a neurological issue -- i think both sides have a point. i like the idea of car-sharing, and if i DID drive, i think i&#039;d go that route. but i&#039;d like it better if the zipcar/carshare owners are paying the going rate for parking. are they? i haven&#039;t read all the stories.

I meant that free parking is not a right and that it&#039;s not the city&#039;s responsibility to offer free parking spots. Personally, I don&#039;t mind that people park their cars on streets. But if the city tries to get that space back for public use, that&#039;s what I would prefer to see, and that&#039;s what I think is a better use of that space. For example, they could do things like turning parking spots into parks... or protected running/walking/bike lanes... or car/bike share programs... Heck, those are all better uses than serving as parking for a few.<br /><br /><br />
