					There&#039;s controversy brewing at the Queens Central blog regarding a comment posted on a rumor that Popeye&#039;s Chicken would be setting up shop in Forest Hills.&nbsp; The rumor turned out to be false.&nbsp; Nonetheless, someone decided to post a racially insensitive comment that has the blog&#039;s members debating the right or wrong of the post.&nbsp; It seems that the OP is a friend of Steve&#039;s, the blog&#039;s proprietor, and Steve claims that his friend&#039;s post is a humorous and edgy attempt to mock racists.&nbsp; Steve says that he will not delete the post, as some bloggers have requested.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.queenscentral.com/2008/01/09/popeyes-and-spinach/#comment-7069" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenscentral.com/2008/01/09/popeyes-and-spinach/#comment-7069</a>

					I stopped by for some shopping earlier today at the Fairway in Red Hook.&nbsp; Before leaving, I had to visit the customer service desk where I happened to notice a delivery service sign.&nbsp; As I casually mentioned to my husband that I was pretty sure they didn&#039;t deliver to our place, the woman attending the desk asked if we lived in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I said no...Queens.&nbsp; She said, &quot;Oh...then you&#039;ll be happy to know that Fairway will be opening another market in Queens.&quot;&nbsp; She went on to explain that they had not narrowed down the location yet, but were strongly considering either Astoria or Five Towns.&nbsp; If this indeed happens down the road, I would much prefer an Astoria location. :rockon:<br /><br />Has anyone heard any info on this?

					My husband and I recently found ourselves overwhelmed tackling electronics cables whereby we decided to call Best Buy&#039;s Geek Squad.&nbsp; The 2 guys they sent over were great and pretty much resolved our problem.&nbsp; Before leaving our place though, there was kind of an awkward moment when the guys just stood around as if waiting for something.&nbsp; I eventually said thank you, and they went on their way.&nbsp; Was I supposed to tip these guys?&nbsp; We paid $100 to Best Buy for the visit.<br /><br />Has anyone ever used these services, and have you tipped the servicemen?

					While checking my yahoo mail, I happened to notice a few responses from one of the family groups I participate in regarding a post from Chowhound and how a French/American bistro would fare in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It seems that the original poster was trying to gauge the interest level of Jackson Heights residents because he/she/they may have a possible locale on 37th Avenue for such a restaurant.&nbsp; The Chowhound mods deleted the original post, but a new discussion has begun on the topic.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how long that one will last.&nbsp; So, on the hopes that this entrepreneur may be reading these forums, the question is:<br /><br />Would you welcome a French/American bistro in Jackson Heights?<br /><br />I vote yes.&nbsp; Although I absolutely love all the wonderful restaurants we have in our community, a French bistro would offer yet another option for those days when when one is in the mood for something different than what we already have in abundance in the Heights.

					There&#039;s been a lot of recent discussion on the neighborhood&#039;s coffee, and it seems that 2007 brought us some new options, in addition to the promise of a soon to open Starbuck&#039;s.&nbsp; Just looking at the polling list shows how lucky we are in Jackson Heights to have so much choice.&nbsp; Below is my take on each place:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Espresso 77:&nbsp; Small and cozy.&nbsp; Awesome coffee, unlike anything we&#039;ve had in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Great for those that enjoy the cafe vibe and like to lounge.&nbsp; Knowledgeable and friendly staff.&nbsp; Eager to please proprietors.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Starbuck&#039;s:&nbsp; Large selection of brews.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t learned enough about all of them yet to comment thoroughly.&nbsp; Kind of the Barnes &amp; Noble of coffee shops.&nbsp; Sit back, relax, read a good book, browse the web, meet a friend, etc.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Dunkin Donuts:&nbsp; I can&#039;t help but feel some loyalty for this place.&nbsp; They&#039;ve kept my coffee cup full for a few years now, especially when all I wanted was just that...a plain ol&#039; cup of drip coffee.&nbsp; The neighborhood senior set seems to enjoy meeting here, and I&#039;ve managed to meet a few interesting folks there.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Seba Seba:&nbsp; Good coffee when you&#039;re in the mood for a cafe con leche accompanied perhaps with an empanada.&nbsp; The vibe can be a bit raucous inside though.&nbsp; In my opinion, a diner serving up Colombian food in addition to coffee.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Lety&#039;s Cafe &amp; Bakery:&nbsp; Nice pastries, delicately prepared by Mr. Herrera, formerly of Veniero&#039;s.&nbsp; Again, nothing like this in the neighborhood...and no, Carollo doesn&#039;t compare.&nbsp; Friendly, family owned and run business.&nbsp; I have no issues with making myself comfortable here.&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed that despite the recent opening of Espresso 77, loyal Lety&#039;s customers keep going back for the Italian pastries.&nbsp; The coffee being served is good, and is traditional drip.&nbsp; Espresso also available, but to be honest, I sneak around the corner for that!&nbsp; No WiFi here, but Lety and Octavio do make you feel welcomed.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Cannelle Patisserie:&nbsp; My version of in and out coffee coupled with an awesome flakey and buttery croissant!&nbsp; Muffins and assorted pastries done to perfection.&nbsp; They seem to now be experimenting with quiche, but I&#039;ve yet to try it.&nbsp; Coffee is a bit on the weak side, and could use some improvement.&nbsp; The place is pretty huge and they still have room for more tables!&nbsp; Good place to take the kids.&nbsp; No WiFi here.&nbsp; Due to its size, it&#039;s can get a bit loud in there anyway, so you really wouldn&#039;t want to try to sit and concentrate on something other than enjoying the amazing pastries.</li><li></li></ul><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>McDonald&#039;s:&nbsp; You pretty much know the deal.&nbsp; I have heard some positive comments on the new coffee they&#039;re serving.</li><li></li></ul><br />What coffee will you be drinking in 2008?

					As I walked by 79th Street between 35th and 37th Avenues yesterday, I happened to easily notice a couple of satellite dishes positioned on top of the row buildings on the west side of 79th and also on the roof of the building on the east side of 79th as you approach 37th Avenue.&nbsp; These dishes are viewable from street level.&nbsp; I may be wrong, but I thought that the Landmarks Preservation Committee only permitted these types of antennae only if they are not within eye view from street level?&nbsp; Does anyone know?&nbsp; I remember a while back when a few residents in our building asked about installation of these dishes, and at that time, the board of directors clearly stated &quot;no way&quot;.

					We&#039;ve been thinking of discontinuing our land line telephone service with Verizon and opting for a digital phone service instead.&nbsp; Any recommendations out there?&nbsp; I see that Vonage&#039;s price is $24.99, which is cheaper than the service offered by TWC.&nbsp; Our building intercom system operates via our telephone line.&nbsp; Would a digital phone affect our intercom service?&nbsp; Does anyone else have the two working well together?&nbsp; At the moment, this is the only reason we&#039;ve held off on making the switch.

					Does anyone know where I can purchase holiday greeting cards written in Spanish, preferably in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for an assortment or any boxed collection rather than buying cards individually.&nbsp; Has anyone seen these at the Hallmark on 82nd Street?&nbsp; I appreciate your help!

					While browsing through the Internet Movie Database website, <a href="http://www.imdb.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.imdb.com</a>, I came across a small bio for an actress from the vaudeville era named Helen Kane.&nbsp; She was most well-known for her signature song &quot;I Want to be Loved by You&quot;&nbsp; and the song&#039;s accompanying phrase, &quot;boop-boop-bedoop&quot;.&nbsp; It seems that Ms. Kane&#039;s image was the model used to create the famous cartoon character Betty Boop.&nbsp; Ms. Kane unsuccessfully sued the creators of the cartoon for wrongful appropriation, as she was not credited as being the model, although most people seemed to recognize it.<br /><br />The above website lists Ms. Kane&#039;s address at the time of her death in the 60s as 77-12 35th Avenue in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; That&#039;s the Berkeley building.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to more information on Ms. Kane from Wikipedia<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kane" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kane</a><br /><br />On a similar note, approximately 20 years ago, I remember accompanying my older sister to an estate sale within her newly purchased co-op.&nbsp; I particularly remember the deceased&#039;s apartment and the collection of vaudeville memorabilia she had attained in her youth.&nbsp; Her family claimed that she was a true flapper in every sense of the word, and her wardrobe collection as well as vintage photographs of herself demonstrated that.&nbsp; She was a beautiful and elegant woman.&nbsp; My sister was able to afford a pair of beautiful velvet gloves, the kind that are long and reach the elbows.&nbsp; They were adorned with satin buttons and tassels.&nbsp; To this day, I can&#039;t believe that this woman managed to keep these gloves in new condition since the 1920s, and my sister managed to lose them on the first occasion she wore them to a party.&nbsp; Talk about a lack of appreciation.&nbsp; Even as a teen, as I was back then, I was in awe of this person, and wish now that I knew more about her.

					Not sure if anyone posted on this yet to be published series of dark stories based in Queens.&nbsp; From looking at the table of contents, it looks like there will be a story dedicated to Jackson Heights.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.akashicbooks.com/queensnoir.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.akashicbooks.com/queensnoir.htm</a><br /><br />It sounds like it will make an interesting, albeit scary read.&nbsp; Looking forward to reading it.&nbsp;

					I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Led Zeppelin concert reunion honoring music mogul, Ahmet Ertegun on You Tube.&nbsp; Of course, some concert goers had uploaded video to You Tube, but Warner Music Group removed them due to copyright claims.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Anyhow, I got my quick Led Zepp fix by listening to this recording of the song Kashmir.&nbsp; It&#039;s accompanied by a photographic slide show of the band.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTaOvzZKRxA" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTaOvzZKRxA</a><br /><br />I hope an official video is soon to come!&nbsp; Jimmy Page is 63 and Robert Plant 59!&nbsp;

					Here&#039;s an interesting article regarding the recent firing of immigrant workers at Fresh Direct in Long Island City.&nbsp; It seems these firings may be considered as union busting attempts by Fresh Direct.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find the online article from today&#039;s Daily News, but its print version states that most of these workers are involved in the packaging department and are very distraught over losing their jobs.&nbsp; Fresh Direct claims to be assisting the INS as they check up on employee documents.&nbsp; Hmmm......<br /><br /><a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/teamsters-and-freshdirect-spar-over-suspensions-of-immigrant-workers/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/teamsters-and-freshdirect-spar-over-suspensions-of-immigrant-workers/</a>
