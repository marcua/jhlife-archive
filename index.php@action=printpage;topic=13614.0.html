				I came across this <strong>DNAinfo</strong> interactive map [see below link] where users can draw lines identifying a neighborhood&#039;s boundaries.&nbsp; The finished drawings represent what each individual perceives as his / her neighborhood.&nbsp; I found this interesting, considering that Jackson Heights proper is frequently misrepresented in news media.&nbsp; The neighboring communities of East Elmhurst, Elmhurst and Corona tend to mistakenly fall into &quot;Jackson Heights&quot; territory.&nbsp; Upon completing my drawing, I noticed that my boundary lines were way off of what others consider Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The question is, who&#039;s right?<br /><br />Draw Where You Think Your Neighborhood Borders Are on This Map (http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150811/midtown/draw-where-you-think-your-neighborhood-borders-are-on-this-map)

				Interesting article. I consider BQE, Northern, Roosevelt and Junction as the borders. Some consider Astoria Blvd. as the north border. I&#039;m only here 4 years, so other people may disagree, as shown on the map.

				I would agree that the BQE, Northern, Junction and Roosevelt are the JH borders. And I think that&#039;s what the post office thinks too.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never seen anyone claim that Woodside (west of the BQE) is actually Jackson Heights. But I always see claims that JH extends north into East Elmhurst, east into Corona and south into Elmhurst. I wonder if it has something to do with the real estate market and comparatively desirable neighborhoods. Just a thought.

				Considering the other side of Northern in the 70s and 80s down to Astoria Blvd. as Jackson Heights actually goes way, way back.

I grew up in this area in the 1970s and early ‘80s and had many friends who lived on the other side of Northern. I feel sure every single one of them to this day think they grew up in, and are from, Jackson Heights.<br /><br />If memory serves, even the “upper Ditmars” area on the other side of the Grand Central was sometimes referred to as Jackson Heights.<br /><br />In my mind, East Elmhurst was the area on the other side of Astoria Blvd. between it and the Grand Central (like from 82nd through that whole residential part going up toward Citi Field.)<br /><br />My father grew up in Elmhurst and I asked him about this very subject not that long ago. He wasn’t terribly interested, but when pressed he confirmed a place called “East Elmhurst” did exist when he was a kid. In those days though, it was very far away ☺<br /><br />I don’t agree generally with any theory about trying to capitalize on any possible “cache” of Jackson Heights at present, though that’s not to say there’s not some realtor doing it. If anything, it seems the rise of the area being East Elmhurst is more about distancing and distinguishing itself as its own separate and distinct place.<br /><br />Also, thinking about the streets in the the 70s on the other side of Northern, up to say the shopping center, it may not even have had houses, or many houses, until around the 1960s or 70s, so maybe it just took awhile for that area to settle on its identity. It would be interesting to know how and when that particular area came to be developed..

				Just out of curiosity, I just contacted Google maps to ask why they are not going by the zip code designation of the areas when they put &quot;Jackson Heights&quot; in the entire area out to LGA.&nbsp; 11369 and 11370 are both East Elmhurst, and they start at Northern Blvd, but this is not reflected in Google maps.<br /><br />Another weird thing is that according to Google maps (depending on how you search) you could be in both East Elmhurst and Jackson Heights at the same time.&nbsp; For instance, if you&#039;re standing on the corner of 30th Ave and 77th St. or 25th Ave and 80th St., in one view you would be in Jackson Heights and in another, you&#039;d find yourself in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; I think that is really confusing, regardless of your opinion of where the neighborhood boundaries are.<br />(http://i.imgur.com/rX2qjKq.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/YXKgK3i.jpg)<br /><br />

				Hmm- The eastern border- I&#039;d say 90th, on the Roosevelt side and Junction on the 34th side. <br />Also, I&#039;ve solved the JH vs. East Elmhurst debate, with a new name- between Northern and 31st Ave, let&#039;s call it No-No...North of Northern, anyone? <br /><br />My section needs a new name- 85th and Roosevelt is JH, Corona and Elmhurst all combined, due to the border Roosevelt makes for precincts, Assembly, school district, council district. They are all very skewed there, and depending on the concern, different identifiers work better than others. <br /><br />

				I wouldn&#039;t look to the USPS to be the final arbiter in neighborhoods. I used to in Sunnyside, but the USPS insisted I lived in Woodside. Never mind that the Sunnyside office was a 5 minute walk from my apartment, and the Woodside post office was two subway stops away.<br /><br />What defines a neighborhood is fairly dependent on individual perspective. Long time residents may have a different idea than newer residents based on their history, going to nearby schools, etc. And who really cares? It&#039;s like folks who want to argue about birth years of generations. Who cares if the cut off between baby boomers and gen x is 1965 or 1960? It&#039;s not like it makes any meaningful difference.

				I think Jackson Heights has narrowed itself down to the historic district. That is what all the real estate is about, at least. Roosevelt and down to 73rd get added for flavor, but it&#039;s a very narrow border when it comes to class, status, opportunity and the like.

				Realtors are happy to push the boundaries. It may be an apartment in Corona, but if it&#039;s close enough to Jackson Heights to fudge it a bit for the listing, there&#039;s benefit (for both the realtor, seller, and the buyer who might not be able to afford the Historic District, but can swing a one bedroom near Junction Blvd.) This happened in all over Brooklyn a decade ago.

				From a Department of City Planning report, circa 2006-<br />East Elmhurst in north-central Queens is bounded to the north by LaGuardia Airport, to the east by Flushing Bay, to the south by Northern Boulevard, and to the west by 85th Street. Prior to World War I, North Beach, as it was called then, was “Queens County’s Coney Island” on Long Island Sound, with picnic grounds, dance halls, and amusement park rides. The area was developed in 1905 as a neighborhood of frame houses on small lots; those on the bluff overlooking the Bowery Bay had private beaches. Prior to 1937 the area was wholly residential, but transportation and utility uses, including the Bowery Bay Water Pollution Control Plant, transformed the shoreline before and after WW II.

				Strictly speaking Jackson Heights as developed by Edward A. MacDougall and the Queensboro Corporation ends at Northern Blvd. Even the topography is all down hill from there to La Guardia. Actually the highest elevation of JH is around 35th Avenue between 79th St. and 80th St. <br /><br />The area north of Northern Blvd. for the most part was not developed until the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s. When the JH Shopping Center was erected that area was already in an identity crisis. Perhaps some saw it as an extension of the original JH? We could call it Chicago if we wanted to but that doesn&#039;t make it so. Today that area is called East Elmhurst which doesn&#039;t seem to make much sense either. The Post Office in the shopping center calls itself Trainsmeadow. That&#039;s likely after the old road which once ran through the area and also related to the general area around it.&nbsp; I never hear anyone over there calling the place Trainsmeadow. And I think they even know East Elmhurst is sort of odd.<br /><br />Prior to the incorporation of Queens County into NYC this part of Queens was the City of Newtown. Newtown&#039;s borders were roughly Bowery Bay to the north, Brooklyn to the south, where the BQE now is to the west, and Flushing Meadow to the east. Within Newtown&#039;s borders was a section called Charlotteville which roughly corresponds to today&#039;s East Elmhurst. <br /><br />Maybe those north of Northern Blvd. aught to look into their own history. Sorry, but they are not JH.<br /><br />http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e2-49ff-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 (http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e2-49ff-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99)
