					I have to agree with the people who say this isn&#039;t a great neighborhood for younger single people, especially if they&#039;re dating. The people I know who are younger, dating and going out, are all doing it in Astoria, LIC and Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn. To be young in JH seems to mean being on the train a lot going to these centers of gravity where all your friends are. This is a neighborhood for people who go home to their families after dinner, or for ... whoever goes to those bars on Roosevelt, always a mystery to me.

The sidewalks there are horribly overcrowded, and double parking is a mess that brings traffic to a halt anyway. Why not open it up, give the restaurants more outdoor breathing room, allow for more room to roam, and more space to play and hang out? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />37th Avenue can&#039;t be closed because key major 37th Avenue business owners are steadfastly against it. The ones with the constantly double-parked mid-day delivery trucks, and also the ones with the double and triple-parked out-of-town SUV shoppers. 37th is actually not a truck route, but is used as a truck route thoroughly and frequently. <br /><br />34th never had that level of constant commercial traffic; it also has the median, the shade trees, the multiple schools and the park. So 34th can function as an extension of the park, solve some of the issues with schoolkids crossing the street (especially with the IS230 building layout), etc. <br /><br />There are some bigger issues around the assertion that &quot;you can&#039;t have groceries in the neighborhood without double-parking tractor-trailers in the middle of a busy street at midday&quot; that really nobody at any level of city management or design wants to have to even think about. Obvious answer is to make each block in front of a grocery store a loading-only zone, but for some reason no, that&#039;s not a thing we can do.

The fact is that social services have broken down during the pandemic; shelters have emptied out because people are afraid of getting COVID in congregate shelters; the services which bring people to shelters and hospitals are no longer doing so because they&#039;re safer on the streets than getting COVID in congregate settings; etc. None of this can be separated from the pandemic, which is absolutely still ongoing, much as we would like to pretend it&#039;s not. There is not a lot that -can be done- for these folks without services that gather groups of people in places, which is still verboten because there is still a pandemic.

Many people don&#039;t commute any more, which means they aren&#039;t eating lunches or dinners near their places of work, they&#039;re eating them at home where they live. People also don&#039;t shop in Manhattan or take the train to a fancier grocery store any more (those who did.) So, big boom in local grocery stores. It&#039;ll be interesting to see if that lasts past COVID.

For Fios customers in the neighborhood, was wondering what package other people are paying for. We have 2 adults and 2 kids working/schooling from home, and were having trouble with Zoom lag/dropped video calls at the cheapest plan (200 Mbps, $39.99/month). Called customer service and they pitched me on the priciest plan of course (Gigabit, $79.99.month). Have others found the need to upgrade their plan with multiple folks working at home?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes. We have three people and went to the 400 plan, and it&#039;s good. Also make sure that the problem isn&#039;t just your WiFi. The walls in our old buildings really block WiFi and you may need to use a USB adapter or a wireless extender to get around corners.

If you mean that their products are reliable, fresh, innovative and the stores are clean and have excellent customer service, then I would agree. However, if you are equating upscale with expensive, then I don&#039;t agree at all. Trader Joe&#039;s prices are more reasonable <em>for quality goods</em> than anywhere else I could think of shopping -- including the stores here in JH (with the exception of the produce markets).<br /><br />And since this thread is about the new grocery store and not Trader Joe&#039;s, I should mention I took a swing through and took at look at the one product that I know how to do price comparisons for, the large Quaker Oats canister. At this new store it costs $6.99. At C-Town it&#039;s $6.49. At the market that used to be called Fruta Dona on 37th and 83rd, I recently bought it for $3.99. At Target it&#039;s $3.49. So that leads me to the conclusion that the prices are not much of a bargain here. I&#039;m sure they have some loss leaders and sales, so if you&#039;re shopping for something else, perhaps you&#039;ll find a decent price.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;d be surprised. On statistical measures, we come out as a low income area. Our median household income for 11372 is $60659 with a median of $41852 in one-earner households and $84745 in dual-earner households. Down in Rego Park it&#039;s noticeably higher: $66795 overall with $60767 in single-earner households and $116047 in dual-earner households. East Elmhurst is in between. I like to hammer on this, but the population of this board and our neighborhood online groups isn&#039;t statistically representative of the overall population of the neighborhood, which is *much* lower income and *much* higher percentage Latino than tends to be represented here.
