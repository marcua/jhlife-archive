				&nbsp;I would make a sign and put it in the front door of a number of homes on that street and see if you get any takers. There should<br />be an underground lot opening soon at Northern and 72nd if that helps any.

				&nbsp;Under that mustard colored building that has taken forever to be open. It&#039;s supposed to be an MRI place<br />on the first floor and the construction guys have been parking below. They tell me it&#039;s two levels underground.

				The east side of buildings on 74th Street between 35th &amp; 37th Ave., they have several underground parkings.<br />When I asked the price last year, I was offered around $280/m.&nbsp; <br />I decided to park on street. =)

				$280 a month plus additional fees for a first time will run $600+ for the first month. Thats very expensive! I was hoping Id find something a little more affordable!

				i suggest you go speak to some Supers in buildings with parking garages personally.&nbsp; Go to the front door of the building and ring the bell for the Super&#039;s apartment.<br /><br />I had to park in the garage on 37th and 82 for months before I got a spot. It is currently $280 plus fees, and is valet parking which means you have to give the guy a tip.&nbsp; Talk about gouging.

				I plan on speaking to some of the supers...<br /><br />$280 is way too much plus they charge a month in advance and additional fees for the first month. Its nearly $700. <br /><br />Where are you parked now? How much do you pay?

				There are occasionally signs in front of the smaller private houses.&nbsp; Wander up and down the streets- I think there is one on 73rd between 35th and 34th ave right now... these should run you between 125 and 200 a month.&nbsp; I have a space in a private garage on 74th street and it runs me 150 a month... good luck!

				Can you come and go as you please in that space or is it a long garage/driveway where cars constantly need to be moved around?

				The garage in my building has a super long waiting list (literally 2-3 years long) and spots are about $150/month. If you don&#039;t live in the building they will charge you more, around $200. I got to the top of the list and was offered a spot but $150/month was too much along with the recent rent hikes. Is it just me, or is parking getting worse in this area? (76th/37th)

				We have a 10 year waiting list. Spots are about $85 I think. We started on the list at #137 over 3 years ago and have moved to #97. I look around for spots in the neighborhood, but I haven&#039;t found one. I would pay up to $200/month to be free from parking woes.
