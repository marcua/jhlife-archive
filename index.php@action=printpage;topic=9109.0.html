				The former athletic field from the Garden School, now an expansion of Travers Park, was dedicated Setp. 23 as Rory Staunton Field, in memory of a student from that school who died last year from sepsis. More about Rory here: http://www.jhgreen.org/wordpress/?p=170<br /><br />Councilman Dromm announced during the dedication plans for a visioning session of Travers Park redesign on Saturday, Oct. 26.

				&nbsp;Can we name part of the park for Miguel Torres from IS145, another middle schooler from Jackson Heights, who<br />was tragically taken from us crossing Northern Blvd in March? The other play area in the schools yard would seem<br />like a good candidate. Both of these boys are really missed.

				&nbsp; This date is very problematic with anyone who has a 8th grade student (maybe from IS145) who is taking the<br />once yearly Specialized High School entrance exam. It&#039;s very stressful for families and might be too much to do<br />in one day. Or the many teachers and administrators that work overtime this day.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Any flexibility for this date? Some students in this neighborhood study for years for this one test...

				Today was the first visioning session and, although I did not count, I think there were about one hundred people present.<br /><br />Each person was given a paper with three questions. What are the top three things you&#039;d like to see; your top concerns; and your hopes for what the park can be for future generations.<br /><br />People were sitting at tables in the school&#039;s cafeteria. Each table became a group and had an easel board. Each group&#039;s ideas was consolidated on the board and presented to everyone else at the end.<br /><br />Most people, maybe all, agreed that the park needs &quot;more green space.&quot;<br /><br />There were many interesting suggestions, like building a bridge or elevated area, that could create an area protected from the elements below, and increase the park space above. Other interesting suggestions included area for performance, artificial hills (that could serve for sledding in the winter and sun bathing in the summer), an astro turf soccer field, and a walking path all around.<br /><br />There will be other envisioning sessions, but no date has been announced yet. It will probably be at evening time. There is a budget of $5 million to remake the park. There is no date for construction to start, but an official present said that they plan to finish the design next year.

				&nbsp;These events are really great for seeing who cares about the park. I would like to point out though that there <br />could be a lot more involvement of those who actually use the park and a presence of youth in these meetings.<br />&nbsp;Also, more disclosure about what is off the table- like no work on the area that includes the kids<br />playgrounds (were recently renovated 2x) or the handball/full sloping basketball courts. Also no new comfort <br />stations, possibly renovations but not with any certainty. And what about relative prices for certain improvements compared to funds available. If a plan such as seating and greenery on 78th street eats all of the budget, is <br />this the single thing that the community wants the most?<br />&nbsp; Something really odd was the little scale models that were supposed to give an idea of placement. Clearly no<br />soccer fans in who made these as the huge size of the field made people toss this idea instantly. Am not sure<br />this is so smart as one of our Jackson Heights playgrounds that is, in my opinion, really works and well-loved<br />by the community IS a soccer field between Northern and 34th Ave. behind the elementary school on 89th? <br />and with a great amount of seating on the Northern side. Is it regulation size? But it works and I think soccer <br />was discarded way too quickly as an option because of the models<br />&nbsp; Also safety and maintenance issues were really glossed over. Why? Enclosing the park creates a number of <br />safety hazards but I would think the surrounding residents would be scared of having a deeply enclosed area<br />that would potentially attract problems at night. Were residents of the New Salem apts who will be majorly<br />affected consulted here? They should have a big say. Officers were there in the back for awhile and their <br />input would&#039;ve been nice as I know that they drive right through the playground occasionally to make their<br />presence known.<br />&nbsp;I know that there is one more spring summer session planned and if some Google data could be used on<br />who uses the park for what and when, we could do a more accurate job of planning real use activity. The<br />running track for example at IS230 is barely used. It&#039;s skateboard heaven (wonderful) most of the time but<br />another track seems redundant. Hope somewhere between the renovation behind PS69 that Councilman<br />Dromm mentioned and the park behind the school on 89th?st are close to what we ultimately get as they<br />both work in our heavily trafficked parks in our lovely neighborhood with lots of private, beautiful gardens.

				Yes, we were also hoping to come to that third session, as the other two conflicted with complicated work schedules.<br /><br />Our original concern was that there be some green (plants!) included in the green space, but more recently we&#039;ve joined a group of JH dog-owners who were hoping to get some provision for off-leash play (20 or so active, but over 1000 signed a petition as of a few weeks ago; I don&#039;t know what the current count is). <br /><br />It&#039;s been hard to get information. Various staff people from Dromm&#039;s office and the various neighborhood groups told us there was going to be another visioning session, and so we&#039;ve been waiting for that for several months. Did we miss the boat? We&#039;ve been watching all these boards for announcements about that session.

				Two visioning sessions were held, resulting in a plan that includes a &quot;great lawn” that would take approximately 2/3 of the athletic field. They did a pretty good jog of incorporating the ideas of those sessions. Personally I’m a little worried that our chronically underfunded Parks Department can maintain a lawn in such a heavily used park, but let’s hope so. <strong>The walk-through visioning session coming up in a couple of weeks is supposed to be more along the lines of tweaking the earlier sessions. </strong><br />I’ll be posting the details on that session on the JHBG FB page today or tomorrow.<br /><br />Meanwhile here’s a head’s up for green folks about something that <strong>starts this Saturday.</strong> Check JHBG FB page and JHL for more details. Italy has La Passeggiata, the evening walk around town.

				&nbsp;The redesign looks greener, that&#039;s for sure. It&#039;s a tricky space and they &quot;listened&quot; to the people who came to the meetings alot of<br />who had young children. The displacement of the age 10+ users of the park is not realistic and was not designed by anyone who<br />spends evening hours there with full on use of the whole park athletically. Where will the older kids and adults play? We will have<br />tennis, baseball, some basketball (not full court), no soccer, displaced skaterboarders, no cricket and less handball which has to<br />also accomodate volleyball. Can&#039;t see this happening.<br />&nbsp;The seating is great though. The green hill lawn looks pretty but seems utterly impossible to maintain given our current parks gardening staffing. One neighbor said aren&#039;t lawns so dated now? It won&#039;t be done for 4-5 years and will be supposedly <br />done in parts to keep the park open. The Farmers Market will be squeezed and the turnaround for the new Garden School <br />PreK with 240 teeny children was weirdly gone. Dangerous for dropoffs for the market and school children. Stage area is small<br />and room for birthday parties will be difficult.<br />&nbsp;I wish they had held the 3rd visioning session so we could&#039;ve discussed the plan before it jumped to a final version as there <br />are some great parts but some definite issues.

				I think it looks great and it will be more welcoming to those of us that don&#039;t have kids and/or are older or less active. It&#039;s nice that the 78th Street portion of the park will extend all the way up to Northern. There&#039;s not enough room for all of the sports you mentioned, itsit. Despite the expansion, it&#039;s still a tiny park. A soccer field alone would have taken up most of Travers as was discussed at one of the visioning sessions.<br /><br />This was the third session - it just was done in a different way than the first two, presenting the initial design before the community which could change. Scheduled completion of design is October 2015.<br /><br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/capital-project-tracker/project/6276 (http://www.nycgovparks.org/planning-and-building/capital-project-tracker/project/6276)<br /><br />&quot;Project Update: The schematic design for this project has been approved internally at Parks and is now going through review by the community board and external regulatory agencies for comment and approval.&quot;<br /><br />

				1. Is there going to be a dog run?<br /><br />2. LOL @ 2 tennis courts. It seems like there&#039;s room for 3, so I have no idea why there&#039;s only 2. And it&#039;s going to be constantly busy. People who want to play hounding players on the court, people fighting for courts - especially if there&#039;s no Parks employee present. Nobody is going to be able to actually enjoy themselves unless they&#039;re there to play for an hour. Might as well just scrap the idea and build something else there.

				Jackson Heights Post comes to the rescue with a .pdf image of the plan:<br />Design plans for Travers Park include a ‘Great Lawn’ (http://jacksonheightspost.com/design-plans-for-travers-park-include-a-great-lawn/)<br /><br />I had a hard time interpreting this when I first saw it, so I&#039;ll pass along something that was explained to me:&nbsp; The big new east-west walkway lining up with the big circle on 78th Street is approximately 40 feet south of the tall fence that currently separates the large asphalt yard from the children&#039;s play area.

				Whoops Todd, you are right.&nbsp; Wishful thinking I guess. :o <br /><br />And earbears, while the new design may limit the park options for older teens and young adults, a large lawn with benches would provide wonderful respite for vagrants. <br /><br />Speaking of Spaces for teens and young adults, the amount of marijuana smoking going on down in the lower courts today was especially potent. I think all the kids in the sprinklers got contact highs.&nbsp; it made me want to keep filling water balloons. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Here it is for those that don&#039;t feel like clicking thorough:<br /><br />(https://html2-f.scribdassets.com/7ib5vczneo4kybi3/images/1-eb60ab3eec.jpg)<br /><br />The design does include an expansion of the playground, pushing it further south. I won&#039;t be using the playground, but this does not bother me. There are many areas of the park in this design that I won&#039;t make use of which is fine as I understand the park is meant to serve the community as a whole. As Travers Park is now, I don&#039;t use the park other than a place to pass through or to visit the farmers market. I will use the park if what is built resembles this design. I find it hard to believe I&#039;m alone in feeling this way.<br /><br />We definitely need more public, open green space in JH. This is a great start. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=13445.msg64454.html#msg64454">Quote from: earbears on July 21, 2015, 12:29:06 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am sorry to the loss of the baseball field and the basketball area.

				I think the green lawn is a horrible idea. To take away the heavily used asphalt area that is used for baseball, vollyball, bike riding, jogging and tennis and replace it with a lawn just doesn&#039;t make sense.

				With the addition of Staunton Field (which is remaining paved) and the expansion of 78th up to Northern, I think we may actually be gaining paved area.<br /><br />I can think of several activities that the lawn would be good for that a paved area would not be.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;We need space for teens and young adults. Yes there will be need to supervise the area - esp. at night. Actually, smoking pot while lying on the lawn will be a nicer place for this activity.<br /><br />But, why are the plans pushing the activities out of the park. The answer is not that there are other areas - that is not really true. Also the neighborhood schools use that baseball field for gym classes and after school teams.<br /><br />I would strongly urge the community and our representatives to try to get a revision to this plan. This may actually causing more issues instead of solving them.

				Matt is on the mark; I welcome the addition of a lawn. As others have said, I don&#039;t use the park now except to walk through and go to the Greenmarket. A lawn would provide a great space for lounging/reading in the grass on lazy days, law seating for movie nights and other events, and just generally more public green space. Desperately needed.

I think the designers have been really considerate of the many uses of the park while trying to introduce some new ones.<br /><br />For those that are new to Jackson Heights and aren&#039;t familiar with the recent history leading up to the redesign, there have been many positive additions of public space to the three blocks between 77th and 80th in this location.<br /><br />1) What started as a temporary play street on 78th Street in the summer months became closed to traffic year round. It is now getting a makeover as part of the Dot&#039;s Plaza Program: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/publicplaza-sites.shtml#2008 (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/publicplaza-sites.shtml#2008)<br /><br />2) The Garden School had some financial difficulties and a decision was made to sell off their playground. Community members, with much help from Council Member Dromm&#039;s office, came together with a plan for the city to purchase this land which most likely would have ended up being sold to a developer: http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rory-stanton-field (http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rory-stanton-field)<br /><br />3) The IS 145 schoolyard becomes part of the Schoolyards to Playgrounds program which renovates schoolyards in exchange for opening them to the community outside of school hours: http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/ps-69-145-congested-jackson-heights-set-open-playgrounds-public-article-1.977432 (http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/ps-69-145-congested-jackson-heights-set-open-playgrounds-public-article-1.977432)<br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/planyc/schoolyards (http://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/planyc/schoolyards)<br /><br />These all are great improvements to our neighborhood, however one thing they all share is that they are and will remain primarily paved and used for sports as per this design. The argument that we are losing paved area used for sports simply is not true. We&#039;ve gained a tremendous amount.

				Is there a concern that the great lawn will get trampled from over use if there is not some sort of pathway through it?&nbsp; It could disrupt the parks mojo if there is always a &quot;keep off the grass sign&quot; out.&nbsp; Just a thought

				&nbsp;The sports that are currently played most days of the year in the area that would now be the grassy hill are volleyball,<br />cricket and soccer, none of which I believe are using regulation size courts. There was a choice to give tennis and baseball <br />their regulation courts. This disperses an evening crowd of JH&#039;s looking for recreation and athletics to where exactly? <br />Every other local area is full to capacity too. The smaller soccer field in the 90&#039;s is always packed. If you Google mapped <br />the activities in the park for a length of time to analyze use, I believe the numbers would skew towards excessive use<br />of the asphalted areas. IMHO a better way would be to take the fences down of course but put in lot&#039;s of green planting <br />of the shrub, small trees and perennial types which have gone a long way in the also busy parks of Manhattan to create <br />green space. Try walking around the park anytime after 5:00 and see what is being used and by whom. I feel certain<br />the planners did not do this.<br /><br />&nbsp; We need to be realistic and I think, progressive, about what this community is and installing a big green hill is questionable<br />in this time of climate change from an environmental perspective. Most areas are moving away from the green lawn- <br />even golf is looking for alternatives- and given the acute need for recreation and our limited budget is this the best choice?<br />I believe there should be a time factor imposed on the lawn if it becomes a reality. So that if it ends up being mostly mud <br />and taking a disproportionate amount of the park maintainence budget, there is a plan B. Or establish a conservancy<br />like the big parks have that make the staffing of the lawns a reality?
