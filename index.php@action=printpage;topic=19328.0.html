				For anyone who was still wondering about the 3 guys posted on the NW corner of 79th and Roosevelt, a little bit of online research will make it clear that they are escorting johns to a nearby garage for sexual services. A few clicks will give you all the details you need.&nbsp; And anyone who has walked down Roosevelt in recent weeks knows that the level of soliciting has risen significantly--the SE corner at 77th and SW corner at 80th are particularly active.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, this leads to several possibilities to the thoughts of our locally elected officials and cops--go ahead and choose your favorite:<br /><br />1) They have no idea what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; Meaning they&#039;re not paying attention to their own neighborhood.&nbsp; Or haven&#039;t bothered with any kind of online research.&nbsp; Which would be alarming since it&#039;s pretty hard to miss.<br /><br />2) They see it every day like most of us.&nbsp; But they acknowledge that there&#039;s nothing that can be done.&nbsp; It&#039;s a whack-a-mole game and not possible to solve under current laws.&nbsp; No point even trying. Sad but possibly true. <br /><br />3) They see it and they&#039;re completely cool with it.&nbsp; A decriminalization of sorts without actual laws.&nbsp; Which means that it&#039;s a tax-free, unprotected, unregulated, abusive, exploitative industry that could be largely helped by legalization rather than ignoring/decriminalizing. <br /><br />4) They see it, are cool with and are, in fact, taking a bit of money on the side to turn a blind eye.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most disturbing of all but hardly without precedent.<br /><br />5) They see it and there&#039;s a plan underfoot. Just you watch.&nbsp; But it&#039;s taking time.<br /><br />For the record, I&#039;m in favor of legalization and regulation but that&#039;s neither here nor there--just pointing out that the concern has nothing to do with prudishness or morality.&nbsp; But the situation is growing and it would be a problem if it brings on other crimes and makes the neighborhood less safe in general.&nbsp; <br /><br />What are your thoughts?

It&#039;s a good first step to getting this taken seriously.<br /><br />The next thing needed: no matter how many people kick and scream, Roosevelt desperately NEEDS a BID to help clean up that block and attract quality businesses (i.e. not &quot;massage&quot; parlors) that ultimately will detract this kind of activity. <br /><br />The net net? It starts with us as concerned and active citizens.

				I am very familiar with the situation, as I park my car in that alley right next to the flop house! I&#039;ve complained to the police, Danny Drumm, the city, the human trafficking hotline, and a bunch of other people I can&#039;t remember. I&#039;ve been voicing my concern for 3 years. The most recent time I went to the precinct an officer admitted that it&#039;s out of their jurisdiction - there&#039;s a special unit that deals with stuff and apparently they are very secretive and don&#039;t work well with the &quot;regular&quot; cops. The officer I spoke to said that they are very aware of the situation, but their hands are tied, but that they&#039;ve been reporting the activities to this other unit regularly. So I think that&#039;s where the fault lies.

				BelowThe7 -- The No. 2 guess is spot on. Last year I brought this issue up with the NYPD officer who is responsible for that sector of the precinct and was told this particular problem has been a focus of the Vice Squad for some time and that they have actually busted and prosecuted some of the people involved. His take was the Vice Squad struggles with cases like this because those arrested are often let out without bail only to reemerge on the street and that these guys are difficult to prosecute. They also can&#039;t arrest the guys every day just for standing on the street. I don&#039;t buy that. The real problem it seems is that this problem appears to be solely the domain of the Vice Squad which means local cops can&#039;t or won&#039;t get involved due to internal NYPD politics. Still, it can&#039;t hurt for all of you call the officer who heads the sector.&nbsp; Maybe the more we call, the more pressure we put on the issue, will help. Here&#039;s the guy&#039;s contact info:<br /><br />Police Officer Bryan Leibold<br />New York City Police Department<br />Neighborhood Coordination Officer<br />115 Precinct<br />92-15 Northern Boulevard<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br />Cell:(929)287-7218<br />Fax:(718)533-6102<br />bryan.leibold@nypd.org<br /><br />I found him very responsive.<br /><br />(Just as an aside, the NYPD has created these NCOs as part of its community policing effort whereby they split precincts into various sectors and place a group of officers who work exclusively in that sector.)

				I sent a link for this thread to officers Bryan Leibold and Tyler Scala, our two NCOs.&nbsp; I have been complaining about this issue for only 18 months; it is obvious walking to Blink in the morning.&nbsp; This past spring they both came to a board meeting of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group and were well informed and well spoken.&nbsp; There is only so much they can do&nbsp; But what are the commanding officers of the 110th and 115th precincts doing and what resources are they demanding to be brought here to end these chronic issues????????? That is the big question.&nbsp; They need to be held accountable before they are promoted to another position somewhere.<br /><br />This has been going on forever.&nbsp; There seems to be a brothel in the basement/garage of a nearby house for many years, yet nothing ever seems to be done about it.&nbsp; Maybe the death at the nearby Kamway Lodge (on 77th Street and technically in the 110th precinct) will get some needed attention to this scourge.

				I still am of the belief that calling and putting pressure on officials from a larger number of concerned citizens may start to be effective at spurring some action. That or we all.band together like an angry mob and drive them out ourselves. Can you imagine if we got like 50ppl to protest outside the flop house? What a scene. It would be amazing.<br /><br />I do think that the more we can attract legitimate businesses to the block, the better. Imagine if Starbucks were on that corner rather than that rinky dink travel agency. A few calls to their PR team about illicit activity happening outside their property line and I would venture to guess those guys would have to find a new corner to call home.<br /><br />

				I wonder if we should organize a protest on that corner? <br /><br />We get a dozen or so residents and we stand there every weekend for a few hours with signs and a bullhorn. We need some kind of slogan or rallying cry. We&#039;d also need a permit I think, which would no doubt get the attention of the police as would the protest. <br /><br />What surprises me is that the merchants don&#039;t seem to care.<br /><br />I&#039;m serious.

				you&#039;re absolutely correct, abc. the more light shined on something like this, the better. <br /><br />the question is, how to make it seem &quot;major&quot; to someone who&#039;s not witnessing it every day. people take notice when there are fentanyl overdoses in parks/public areas, particularly when the victims are nice middle class folks (like most opioid users). i don&#039;t want anyone to OD here, but there has to be something &quot;eye opening,&quot; as opposed to the sort of drug dealing/prostitution that has existed in nyc, on and off, for 60 years.<br /><br />i do hope the problem is solved soon.

				You guys need to think about this for a second.<br /><br />This is not traditional police work. It&#039;s done undercover. Once a bust is made, the agent(s) have to be reassigned. Getting agents is hard enuf as they must blend in (language, customs, street smarts etc). Mostly, they use informants. First they make a bust some place, make a deal, and place the informant somewhere. Then step back. It&#039;s not a one step operation and it&#039;s dangerous work. Press, politicians, etc will only slow down progress, if any.

				Where should we start? I mean the NY Post is not the ideal, but oh boy I bet they&#039;d have a field day with this one! <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s not so much a pitchforks and torches rally, but we rally with parents/kids, citizens, etc. for safer, drug-free streets. We can use Kamway lodge as the rallying cry and we can march right on down to the corner of 79th??&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking of the Travers Park &quot;play in&quot; as the inspiration. Boy ohhhh boy I would love to see those three guys&#039; faces when this crowd shows up LOLOLOLOL

				&nbsp;I think a rally would be great and hope the electeds would attend. As for Roosevelt Ave,<br />I have seen led lighting in soft colors do wonders in other cities for tunnels and poorly<br />lit areas. The changes in technology make those lights easy to use now in places like<br />under the 7. Would really make a difference imho.<br /><br />And the chef&#039;s death in the Kamway Lodge should&#039;ve been a wake up call locally.

				It is amazing that problems that are so out in the open and obvious continue to persist. Maybe it&#039;s time to get a couple of hundred people together and occupy the 115th&#039;s precinct office. The 115th seems to cover too large of an area to police effectively (it really should be divided into two or three additional precincts), but the situation at 79th and the one in the 80s is so obvious that there really is no excuse for these activities to continue for so long.

				Trump is more powerful than AOC or DenDekker (who doesn&#039;t have any say in this district). and he&#039;s from Queens. why shouldn&#039;t he intervene?

				precisely. <br /><br />need to throw a bone to the four right wingers in jackson heights, all of whom post out here regularly (and all of whom show up with the same tattered &quot;socialism is bad&quot; banners outside every AOC town hall -- love those guys).

				This topic has nothing to do with illegal immigration. It’s about enforcing existing laws, which&nbsp; obviously the elected officials in Elmhurst and Jackson Heights are not capable of. I’m just saying I think the federal government should get involved since Roosevelt Ave. has been this way for the past 40 years, no doubt

Thank you JHX, I agree wholeheartedly! And thank you to the people who PM&#039;ed me - I will respond...but I need more!! :)<br /><br />I definitely don&#039;t envision this rally/march/call to action to be about pointing the finger at any specific groups. In fact, I want this to be a really inclusive thing because it affects ALL of us. This is purely about the actual vice crime we see day in and day out on our streets that our elected officials choose not to address and our police seem to not have adequate resources to combat. It hits close to home. Our kids are exposed to it. There&#039;s crime that&#039;s perpetuated by it, whether by association or because other groups see that it&#039;s open game (i.e. bodega robbing, assaults, murder...the list goes on).&nbsp; Personally, I would never walk on Roosevelt alone at night and that&#039;s ONE BLOCK AWAY from the Historic District: Crazy!<br /><br />Someone else said it...no other neighborhood in NYC would put up with what we see every day. Having been born and raised in NYC and lived in BK, Manhattan, and Queens, I can wholeheartedly agree with that statement!
