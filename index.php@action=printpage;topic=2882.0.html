I guess Flushing Meadows is much bigger, but it&#039;s not walking distance from JH. If you live in Williamsburg, however, you&#039;re probably walking distance from McCarren Park. Williamsburg also has that new park on the waterfront, which isn&#039;t much of a park, but it&#039;s in the neighborhood and right on the waterfront.

				Don&#039;t get me wrong, I like McCarren Park, but it is small &amp; crowded, and apart from the new track, it is in tough shape.&nbsp; The view from the new WB waterfront park is great, but half of it is a concrete slab and the other half is overgrown and rocky.&nbsp; FMCP, while not walking distance is a quick bike ride away and there is so much to do, with the pool, the zoo, the tennis courts, mini golf etc.

				I heard awhile back that the bakery on the corner of 37th and 85th? was applying to get an outside seating cafe&nbsp; liscence. The process takes at least four months, and this was about 6 months ago. The rules and regulations are daunting, and about ten pages long. The requirements are quite stringent, and i dont think most restaurants on 37th ave would qualify. The sidewalks are cleary wide enough to meet approval, and im sure 37th ave is zoned for it, but thats the least of it. I think the cost involved prohibits alot of these places from serving food outside. Rent has to be paid to the city, and extra insurance needs to be had for each seat. i dont think their can be outside seating on the side streets, because they are zoned residential. Also, i dont think most of the existing restaurants are wide enough to meet standards. I think most restaurants that have outdoor seating on city/public property, existed before the Zoning laws were changed in 1980. Its much more difficult to put tables and chairs outside these days &gt;:(

				Great thread!<br /><br />My wife and I are also Williamsburg exiles, we&#039;ve been here about 6 months, so far we are loving the switch. <br /><br />Cool (in no particular order):<br />- Canelle Patisserie<br />- Outdoor landscaping with perennials, flowering trees, bulbs<br />- Travers Park / Farmer&#039;s Market<br />- E/F/7/R/V and yes, G (I use it a lot to get back to W&#039;burg E to G at Court Sq / 23-Ely Ave)<br />- FOOD markets, restaurants<br />- Architecture (WBurg is butt-ugly, let&#039;s face it)<br />- Indoor parking in my coop (a nice feature of our otherwise mediocre building)<br />- Queens Hall of Science / Flushing Meadows Park<br />- Good schools<br />- Cultural diversity that doesn&#039;t take place only on the shared borders of otherwise segregated &#039;ghettos&#039; (like in W&#039;burg)<br /><br />Suck:<br />- DOG POOP on the sidewalk (so nasty)<br />- longish walk from train to 34th ave<br />- few / no live music venues<br />- Spuyten Duyvil WB, ???? JH<br />- Friends who think Queens is end of the world<br />- kid friendly brunch spots?<br />- no green space in the neighborhood<br />- no record stores (sorry iTunes is no replacement!!)<br />- I can&#039;t buy the &#039;mansion&#039; on 34th / 75th<br />- Hiram Monserrate<br /><br />I had to think about the &#039;suck&#039; list a lot longer! <br />

				And I do miss it, but we used to have a nice little HMV on 82nd that closed down about a year ago.<br /><br />The way things are going in the record biz, (Tower, Virgin, etc.) I suspect many neighborhoods are/will be lacking &#039;record&#039; stores.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a full &#039;10&#039; compiled yet for either side, but the Pros far outweigh the cons here in this neighborhood.<br /><br />Decent Pub, Record Store, Sidewalk Cafes and less Street Congestion are on my wish list.<br /><br /><br />

				Actually I am a person of color who is extremely offended by these posts but thank you for ignoring the content of what I was saying. We are in the midst of gentrification here that will eventually push the families here out. It is a process that has run people of color out of their neighborhoods all over this city and I just wish there was some acknowledgement of what williamsburg expats moving here and wanting yoga studios actually means.

				well, I think Jackson Heights is always changing. Is it better to change ethnically rather than gentrificationally(??) ? <br />It seems that lots of cultures, Indians, Latinos, Thai and other Asians are coming in here and changing it to suit them. How much different was the neighborhood 10,20,30 years ago? Have you seen the changes, or did you move here because of the current climate expecting it to remain the same through your lifetime? That&#039;s what I like about the neighborhood. A yoga studio or wine and cheese shop will only make the area more diverse.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;The fallacies and stereotype peddling in marntamb&#039;s posts are legion, but I&#039;m going to make a short list of points to dispel the worst myths / straw men in case anyone wants to move the discussion forward.&nbsp; Please add to the list or tear mine up as you see fit:<br /><br />1.) White people have always lived in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; In and of themselves, white people pose little risk even if they lived in Brooklyn for a time.<br /><br />2.) Middle-class and upper-middle-class people have always been an important component of the Jackson Heights community (esp. within the garden co-ops of the historic district).&nbsp; Areas that tend to suffer greatly from gentrification are those with a massive concentration of poverty and/or derelict industrial space that can be quickly converted to high-price housing.<br /><br />3.) Jackson Heights is one big community that contains several smaller communities cohering around shared language, food, religion, etc.&nbsp; These smaller communities are not discrete categories, but rather have varying degrees of overlap with each other.&nbsp; All of us will have some affinity for one or more of these smaller communities.&nbsp; <strong>No single person or group can be said to fully own, control, or speak for any of these smaller communities.</strong><br /><br />4.) The ethnic makeup of Jackson Heights is constantly changing, but has remained very diverse overall for several decades.&nbsp; Some groups are currently more numerous than others, but that has not stayed and will not stay the same over time.&nbsp; For example, the South Asian area of the neighborhood that I live in has seen a decrease in residents of Indian descent, and a noticeable increase in residents of Nepali, Tibetan, and Bangladeshi descent.&nbsp; <br /><br />5.)&nbsp; These changes noted above have occurred in the context of major changes (both up and down) in housing prices in Jackson Heights, but diversity remains.&nbsp; The only group in Western Queens that has declined dramatically in recent years are African-Americans.&nbsp; Some of this decline in African-American residents may be explained by gentrification.<br /><br />6.) People of one ethnic group or race enjoying the cultural products of another ethnic group or race does not necessarily constitute ethnic voyeurism or &quot;Orientalism&quot;.<br /><br />7.) People that are of the same race, ethnicity, class, gender, age, sexual orientation, etc do not all have the same likes and dislikes.<br /><br />8.) Non-white people may enjoy businesses, foods, cultural programs, etc. that are typically associated with young white people.&nbsp; A yoga studio, chocolate shop, or wine bar will not destroy Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Some people were upset when Starbucks opened in Jackson Heights...the same attitudes were expressed in Sunnyside.&nbsp; I contend that Starbucks has done little to no damage to the neighborhood, and actually attracts a relatively diverse crowd (can someone confirm?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been to the one in Sunnyside, which is usually full of diverse teenagers doing their homework.)<br /><br />9.) Individuals of any and all ethnic groups in Jackson Heights will from time to time display bigoted or discriminatory attitudes.&nbsp; One common attitude expressed from many quarters is the &quot;last one in, shut the door&quot; attitude; i.e. when members of an immigrant group previously discriminated against (say, Italians) then discriminate against newcomers (Latinos and Asians arriving in the late &#039;60&#039;s, early &#039;70&#039;s).&nbsp; Framing debates about Jackson Heights issues as &quot;insiders&quot; vs. &quot;outsiders&quot; is sophistry.<br /><br />Flame away!<br />

Many times I&#039;ve left the big green &quot;menace&quot; for another place because it was too crowded. <br /><br />As you point out NYC P no one group can lay claim to a specific area or neighborhood.

I&#039;m a JH native, I&#039;ve never lived anywhere else but here and the neighborhood I grew up in was taken over and changed around me without my permission or even my input, that&#039;s kind of how it goes in NYC. My last year&#039;s tax return and several years before that certainly prove I&#039;m not so high up on the socio-economic scale. And, like many other people in this area and this city, I too am the child of immigrants, so I&#039;m first generation American. But there are those who want to make this issue solely about race, and I&#039;m not sure how that serves anyone. To me it distracts from the real issues at hand and a more productive conversation of how do we all live together and share a community that&#039;s constantly growing and changing. <br /><br /><br />

				I totally agree, there is no &quot;gentrifying wave&quot; more so good people trying to escape high prices and over development in other areas of the city. For gentrification to actually be happening we&#039;d need to see a lot more development in the area. We aren&#039;t, and we probably wont. For the most part the historic district prevents a lot of the destruction of character that comes along with gentrification. If we really want to protect JH the historic district should be expanded and we should look in to down zoning some of the commercial streets (73rd and 74th come to mind) to prevent further growth on an already over burdened section of the neighborhood. <br /><br />

				FWIW, I moved here from a rapidly gentrifying part of Brooklyn (Ditmas Park/Victorian Flatbush) a year and a half ago.&nbsp; I definitely don&#039;t get *that* sense here.&nbsp; When I left, condos were going up everywhere, new restaurants were opening up almost every week where before there were only a couple, there were 3 health food stores on one strip etc. etc..&nbsp; When I moved there (2003) I scored a 2BR for $800, upon leaving in March 08 they were going for almost $2k.+&nbsp;

				I should think that abundance of co-ops in the area, many original, many converted two decades ago, together with the strict development laws, has helped slow the pace of gentrification--so much so, in fact, that I can&#039;t imagine the area will ever become another Park Slope or Williamsburg (why those neighborhoods are idealized is beyond me). You can&#039;t easily push people out who fully owns their place.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t the real problem the lack of rent-control, and exorbitant rents for commercial shops? If the cost of renting stores on 37th was drastically lowered, the area could probably experiment with multi-lingual &amp; LGBT bookshops and outdoor cafes. These amenities don&#039;t necessarily entail gentrification, nor are they just playthings for white people (how chauvinistic, really).

				Part of why williamsburg got so popular was the infrastructure of the neighborhood. Having access to old factories which became perfect for artist studios. Bushwick seems to be next, it already IS basically. JH has none of that. Tell me one place where people can practice their music in the area. <br /><br />We do have great access to subways and cheap rent, but then again, there are soooo many apartments here. <br /><br />Also, the stigma of Queens is huge. most of my friends can&#039;t even fathom coming here. <br /><br />and I would think the rents would go lower if there was less demand, but apparently people are wiling to pay. I would love to open something up, but it costs too much in rent. stupid.
