				that&#039;s disgusting. Can&#039;t imagine how mentally distraught that young girl is right now. I hope she will eventually find peace within her and be strong enough to not let this experience affect her. Thank God for the good samaritan. We as a community needs to look out for each other. <br /><br />Actually, I also experienced an incident in my neighbor (in Queens) last week where I was redeeming bottles at a supermarket&#039;s empty lot.&nbsp; When I turned around, a masked older man addressed me in our native language. I ignored him since it&#039;s strange to ask for something in an empty lot and I&#039;m a female. Then I realized he followed me into the supermarket and started filming me on his latest iPhone. He did this so conspicuously that at one point he was 5 feet away from me. I got scared (and angry), so got on the phone with my mom. Think he saw me on the phone, so after 5 minutes, I saw him left. I told the staff and asked her to go outside to see if he&#039;s still there, luckily, he wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; Is this the norm to film people and post negative comments about them?? Such a passive-aggressive behavior. I took the long way home, so I wasn&#039;t followed. Everyone just please be safe and scream for help when necessary.&nbsp;

I realized, after looking at some of the other articles with better photos, that I&#039;ve seen him around before. I think hanging around the grocery at 86th and 37th.
