					This house is located at 33-50 74th st next to the open lot with trailers on 34th Ave. It was built by the same people who <br />constructed the two mansions that we so recently lose surrounding it. Please someone but this house and preserve it! It&#039;s a<br />great 60&#039;s style home and its now a two family but a big group could make it a fabulous one family. Five bedrooms and 4 <br />baths, 2 car garage, large deck on 2nd floor, rear yard. <br />&nbsp;What concerns me is that someone will come in and tear this down because of the double lot and built something awful or<br />that it will be chopped up and 25 people will be living there as is often the case in some of the JH houses. This is a really<br />unique house and you can call Shaheen Abdin at 917/254-7162 or at <a href="mailto:sabdin@Laffey.com" class="bbc_email">sabdin@Laffey.com</a> for more info.<br />&nbsp; The asking is 1.1 Million. I know. But really this is a fine house and it would be so great for someone to buy it and preserve<br />it in Jackson Heights. It&#039;s a very liveable house and I hope the buyer will respect the integrity of the home and the neighborhood.

					&nbsp;It looks like today will be much different weather than yesterday! In today&#039;s NYTimes, there is an ad for $5. passes <br />to the US Open grounds to view the finals on the big screen in the courtyard area. I think if you wanted to be in the <br />vicinity of some tennis lovin folks for the energy of it all, this is a great deal. The food court is pretty good in my<br />opinion and there are a number of higher priced options too. Just check before you go and see if the schedule changes<br />from last night make any difference though.

					&nbsp;The wonderful street theatre company, Theatre for the New City, once again brings us their political performances which<br />are often customized for the times and the neighborhood. In this political climate, it will no doubt be something funny and<br />thought provoking. I love how they often include audience participation during the performance and make a big effort to<br />explain the concepts to younger kids. Come support them and show how Jackson Heights represents in this crazy political <br />arena at this last concert of this series. <br />&nbsp;They are scheduled for this Sunday at 2:00 on 78th Street by the side of Travers Park. Bring a blanket or chair...<br /><br /><em>Also </em>The Dan Sheehan Conspiracy is a bonus concert at 5:00 performing original rock.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks to Jackson Heights Beautification Group for their continued efforts in bringing us these &quot;Summer Sundays in the Park&quot; <br />for so many years! You can donate to them on the JHBG website or Facebook accounts to make sure they keep going.

					&nbsp; Three newly planted street trees (this year by Million Trees.org) on 73rd Street and the corner of 37th <br />Avenue have been chosen for decoration for the celebration of EID. They have been wrapped with strings<br />of hundreds of tiny blue lights and this is dangerous for their survival. These trees were already replaced <br />once and a few people have been caring for them as they are clinging to life on this very busy street. It&#039;s<br />a concern that the community organization has chosen this method of using vulnerable street trees on <br />public property to celebrate. The leaves are already browning and the tape for the lights is all over the<br />branches.<br />&nbsp; This has been reported to the Million Trees group but if you can think of another way to tell the owners <br />on 73rd St. that the celebration and the lights are lovely - but just not on these young fragile trees, please<br />help! Thanks.<br />

The band includes musicians playing percussion, bass,<br />guitar and flute. Mark your calendars as this is one to definitely not miss! At 5:00 in 78th street and <br />it&#039;s free.

					&nbsp;On two recent weekends, NY1 profiled Jackson Heights residents beautifying Travers Park. The Parks Dept is working hard but we are there to add some<br />additional community support in keeping the Park in good shape. It&#039;s great to see this work recognized and also to invite others to participate as these <br />are all inclusive events. This past weekend at IT&#039;S MY PARK DAY, there were tons of little ones (and their families) who helped plant and paint and mulch. Anyone who would like to participate in future events can sign up to the JHBG mailing list on their website. That&#039;s the Jackson Heights Beautification<br />Group, the organization that sponsors Friends of Travers Park, The Green Agenda for Jackson Heights, the JH Art Show, the Historic Tour and the <br />Halloween Parade. Sign up to help in the park or on any of the other projects this civic group has going on in Jackson Heights. IT&#039;S&nbsp; YOUR PARK!<br /><br />&nbsp;To know about more about local volunteer events that any age can help with (individuals or families), and to GET DIRTY, please contact:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="mailto:membership@jhbg.org" class="bbc_email">membership@jhbg.org</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ga4jh" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/ga4jh</a><br /><br />

					You can make a difference in who gets $3 million in preservation grants if you vote for your favorite Queens or NYC spot. The Rocket Thrower sculpture<br />in Flushing Meadows park, the Louis Armstrong House, Queens Farm Museum and Flushing&#039;s Town Hall are all there as well as a number of other<br />terrific places in other boroughs. You can vote once a day till May 21st. Hope we can get some of the monies to come our way!

					&nbsp;I find it alarming that the situation for students who are in or headed to local high schools &nbsp;from JH is turbulent. Four high schools<br />in a five mile radius of Jackson Heights are on the failing list out of 24 schools citywide! and are slated for closure now. Those are<br />Bryant and Newtown which are most popular in JH, then Long Island City and Flushing. A lot of people in the neighborhood do look<br />for better alternatives and we have local private schools which are great like Garden School, Renaissance HS and now McClancey <br />which will be co-ed in the fall. Specialized high schools and most of the charters mean long commutes and schedules which inhibit <br />other activities, family time and jobs, things I personally think are as important as grades. I think this is a real hole in the <br />neighborhood and hope it is on someone&#039;s radar as a high school would take awhile to build but think it&#039;s a truly great asset to a <br />community. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone?

					Take a walk over to see the tremendous green work done by all age helpers through JHBG this past weekend on 69th street in a cleanup and planting session. It has transformed the street! It could qualify as our next nice green area is this keeps up! Beautiful gardens planted with flowers, shrubs and herbs. Trees and grass- yes, grass!- in the middle of the street and the new composting area which is coming in soon near 35th Avenue. Heroic efforts by many community volunteers led by JHBG&#039;s Nuala O&#039;Doherty! Thanks to all them, big and small, who made it happen. Our entrance to Jackson Heights can now be enjoyed rather than avoided by residents and visitors alike. Real Earth Day spirit.

					Am not sure what the chronology of green groups is here in Jackson Heights. The group that I have long seen doing the most is JHBG- the beautification<br />group. And the Green Agenda, which I think grew out of or is annexed to Friends of Travers Park. What is Green Alliance and are they in co-operation or<br />in opposition to these others groups? And why would we need so many green groups here in the first place? It seems like a consolidation would make<br />more sense to reach more folks which is usually a problem here in JH. I saw a posting that Green Alliance is now seemingly running the Travers Park <br />redo. I am wondering if there is some undercurrent of discontent that should be disclosed or does this all make sense somehow?
