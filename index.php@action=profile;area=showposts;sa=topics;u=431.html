Since 1987, it pioneered the concept of a research-based, developmentally appropriate, early childhood music curriculum that strongly emphasizes and facilitates adult involvement.<br /><br />NOT too late to register !!!<br /><br />Musical development, like language development, is a continuous process that benefits from consistent exposure and reinforcement, so we encourage you to continue your participation through the summer.<br />Here is a link to an article about early childhood musical development on a British paper, in case you have missed.<br /><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/may/08/singing-children-development-language-skills" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/may/08/singing-children-development-language-skills</a><br /><br />Summer 2011 Class Schedule(6 weeks):<br />Jackson Heights(81-10 35th Ave, Community Church)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Tue.(6/21-7/26)-SeungHee-9:30am/10:30am/11:30am(3â€™s+4â€™s)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Thu.((6/23-7/28)-Suzanne-9:30am/10:30am <br />Sat.(6/25-8/6, no class on 7/2)-SeungHee 10:00am /11:00am(3â€™s+4â€™s)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Sunnyside/Woodside(49-10 43rd Ave, Woodside Ballet);<br />Thu.(6/23-7/28)-SeungHee-10:00am /11:00am<br />Sun.(6/26-8/7, no class on 7/3)-Suzanne-9:30am / 10:30am(3â€™s+4â€™s)<br /><br />3&#039;s&amp;4&#039;s class(for children born before December 2008) is more active physically as well as verbally to meet children&#039;s needs. We&#039;ll be introducing solfege (Do, Re, Mi,..etc) in our tonal patterns and we&#039;ll be playing rhythm patterns with more specific/detailed body movements. It&#039;s fundamentally same but basically more active. It all depends on each case, but some children sing more in class by this age, some still sing only at home.
