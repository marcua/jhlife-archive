				The pharmacy that opened in the space next to Romeo&#039;s has a &quot;for rent&quot; sign in the window and was closed yesterday afternoon, despite a full inventory on display. According to one person on this board, Romeo&#039;s itself is up for sale, and the &quot;home care&quot; agency had paper over the windows as well (although that could be the regular state of affairs there). Hoping there&#039;s not a mass vacancy over there).

				Too much competition in the pharmacy market. Half of all restaurants close in the first 5 years. The high rent accelerates the closure. It is very hard for independent pharmacies to compete with the few mega chains.

				I&#039;ve always wondered why the developer/owner didn&#039;t convert the building into apartments. There&#039;s a lot of demand for housing in the neighborhood whether co-ops or rentals.

				it might have been difficult to get the zoning changed from commercial to residential. commercial loans work differently than residential ones as well, although i&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a loan in the mix here. there&#039;s definitely a demand, but i don&#039;t know that it could have been addressed here.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19596.msg97041.html#msg97041">Quote from: am315 on December 16, 2019, 09:22:26 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve always wondered why the developer/owner didn&#039;t convert the building into apartments.

				I think they made a mistake in not listening to community input. All they wanted was to make the most rent- they seemed to have no vision about what type of business would help make that area a focal point of the neighborhood. Even if they had to take a lower rent amount, it seems like it would have made more sense to put in a business that people have been clamoring for (like a decent gym).

The building does not have a single landlord per se - it&#039;s a group of the collected heirs of the Bruson family, who live scattered around the country and who gave instructions simply to maximize their investment. They have no interest in creating a community amenity, they&#039;re just trying to get the rent they can get, and there&#039;s no real single decision-maker to pressure.<br /><br />But at least it isn&#039;t a Popeye&#039;s and a McDonald&#039;s, which was at one point on one of the proposals.
