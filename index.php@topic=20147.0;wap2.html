			Hi, any ideas what to do with a baby squirrel?&nbsp; It was found in a local garden, and we believe its mother was killed.&nbsp; Thanks.

			Hi, thanks for the lead...I will contact them.&nbsp; Cute little squirrel, but needs help if he is to survive.&nbsp; I will let you know how it goes.

			Are you positive the mamma squirrel is dead? Can you put it in a warm box near where you found it to see if the mamma comes back? Are there other babies? It might take a few hours for her to come back.&nbsp; The nest might have been destroyed and Squirrels usually have several nests.

			Hi, someone had found a dead squirrel in the garden shortly before we found the baby squirrel wandering around on the grass.&nbsp; We have a little box for it with a small blanket and it stayed in it over night.&nbsp; We have been feeding it some peanut butter (which it loves), and giving it milk through an eye dropper.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am contacting some NYC agencies today.&nbsp;
