				Hi everyone, new here to JH Life! <br /><br />I live in a very small co-op and we need a new boiler maintenance company, someone to turn the boiler on and off when the seasons change, and for general inspections. We have a gas heat boiler. <br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations? <br /><br />Thanks!

				In over 15 years our building has gone thru several different companies.&nbsp; This will sound libelous but I think most of them are slightly dishonest.&nbsp; Ditto elevator companies.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never experienced anything like it.&nbsp; No matter who we use, they say &quot;the last company cheated us&quot;.&nbsp; Then the new company proceeds to cheat us because that&#039;s what the NEXT company coming in says.&nbsp; Geeesh!&nbsp; Sometimes, when you have an emergency, your present company is busy so you bring in some other company.&nbsp; The company you bring in says the company you&#039;re using is lousy.&nbsp; Then when your regular company comes back for some problem, they say the <span class="bbc_u">Othe</span>r company sabotaged you.&nbsp; OH MY GAWD!!!! And if you don&#039;t sign &quot;a contract&quot;, god forbid you have a problem during the winter.&nbsp; They&#039;re &quot;busy&quot;.&nbsp; Right now we&#039;re using Abilene.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They&#039;re okay.&nbsp; I&#039;m not jumping up and down recommending them though.

				Oh, BTW, I hope I didn&#039;t scare you!&nbsp; &nbsp;:laugh:&nbsp; &nbsp;I was ranting but I was laughing while I typed.&nbsp; You probably couldn&#039;t hear that though, huh?&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />

				I wanted to go back to this because of an incident in my co-op this week.&nbsp; Our elevator shut down.&nbsp; Our present service company came and checked it out and then submitted a Proposal for OVER $7,400!<br /><br />Since we don&#039;t usually have any serious problems with this particular elevator, the Board decided to call another company in for a second opinion/Proposal.&nbsp; A Supervisor came out, spent 2 hours going over the elevator.&nbsp; He lubricated where it was needed, tweaked something else&nbsp; etc. and our elevator is working just fine again.<br /><br />The first company would have had us without service for about a week waiting on parts they said were necessary plus they said our elevator needed to be &quot;rehung&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;m sharing this for all the shareholders on this site. I got involved with my co-ops Board because I had a feeling the building was bleeding money.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let other people run your investment.&nbsp; Get involved if you can.&nbsp; I know I was ranting in my previous posts to esmits but this is why.&nbsp; What happened this week is not uncommon.<br /><br /><br />
