				Semi-annual? I thought we got featured quarterly! Though I am not sure it&#039;s a good thing... NYC Finance seems to think 12 to 17% annual property tax hikes are acceptable now.

				&quot;Jackson Heights is the next big thing&quot; YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNN.<br />In the standard-issue diversity paragraph, they could at least have mentioned Tibetans &amp; Nepalis as another big presence.

I suggest to people who are looking in Brooklyn to look in JH before they buy.&nbsp; So far, all have moved here and are loving it.

The vibe is friendly &amp; neighborly, especially in the &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; stores and restaurants (<em>i.e.</em>, non-chain establishments), where one quickly feels like a &quot;regular&quot;.&nbsp; And, at the same time, because of the enormous ethnic diversity, one feels to be in the center of a great cosmopolis.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Please: You need to drop this &quot;anyone who doesn&#039;t love JH like me is from the Midwest&quot; story line. Besides not being true (you accused me once of being a dreaded Midwesterner, and my family has been in NYC since Lincoln was President), it is insulting to anyone from those places. I think Houston is probably plenty diverse. Have you even been to those places? If you love Jackson Heights, which you obviously do, that&#039;s all you need to say. People will respect you for your loyalty to a place, but not if you constantly put other places down.<br /><br />http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Houston-region-is-now-the-most-diverse-in-the-U-S-3384174.php<br />

				I recently moved to a 3 bedroom in JH.&nbsp; We could have moved to any neighborhood in Queens, i.e., very large downpayment, very large household income, spouses both have advanced degrees, and no debt. We chose JH because it is way closer to the City than Forest Hills (five or six extra stops on the local line - sometimes the express goes local) and FH is too close to the Boulevard of Death (we have kids).&nbsp; Bayside is nice, but then you have to buy a car and pay for the long Island Rail Road in addition to the MetroCard.&nbsp; Additionally, JH offers far more dining in terms of ethnic restaurants and you don&#039;t need a car.&nbsp; (Aside: we had to live in Queens because it was close to extended family who play a role in providing childcare.)<br /><br />As compared to Astoria and LIC, JH is far less expensive/reasonable and the historic district&#039;s character makes it a special place.&nbsp; I wanted a 3-bedroom, but did not want to spend over a million dollars.<br /><br />LIC is pretty awesome - nice parks and cool bars - but the 3-bedrooms are ridiculously expensive.&nbsp; Astoria is pretty nice, but the housing stock is disorganized and it only has access to local train lines.&nbsp; Sunnyside is pretty awesome, but the 7 train is unreliable.<br /><br />JH has the best options in terms of housing and transportation and most importantly offers the best bargain - at least for now.<br /><br />JH&#039;s diversity is a big fat plus - it keeps life interesting in terms of people watching and exposure to different culture, i.e., food and entertainment.<br /><br />On that note, I am not surprised the NY Times did an article on my news neighborhood.

I assume (but could be wrong!!) that most people are talking about places close to either the 74th or 82nd st subway stops.<br /><br />According to the city’s demographic data, JH extends from roosevelt all the way up to the grand central parkway. and from 69th into the mid 90’s. <br /><br />I’d be interested in the relative and absolute demographics (both compared to the city’s JH definition and the city as a whole) of the historic district.<br />

Most would agree that Roose ave is an eyesore for this neighborhood. And Little India is unkept. The fact is that is not where most of us actually live, that is a transit hub and little india a shopping area.<br /><br />It just seems lazy to only show those two spots and that&#039;s what most articles focus on.
