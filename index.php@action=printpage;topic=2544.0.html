				<strong>I have 2 Maltese dogs.&nbsp; They are very different from one another.&nbsp; While I did pay rate for Hercules I paid very little for Lambo (it was one of those &quot;save a pet&quot; program thingys) since he was three years old.&nbsp; I grew up surrounded by animals and when I lived in JH years ago my chow MIMI and my mini Pom, Hercules (don&#039;t say it!) were stolen on two separate occasions.&nbsp; I really missed my Mimi, she was a dark blue tongue jet black Chow Chow.&nbsp; She never barked and she was on the small side.&nbsp; She was not very affectionate like my Maltese.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Pomeranian was loud and barked and barked and barked.&nbsp; It belonged to my girl friend (many years ago) and we had a bad habit of tying the dogs in the front of the house after a long walk.&nbsp; One day someone simply cut the canvas handle and made off with Mimi.&nbsp; I was in total shock...I searched and searched the area and placed fliers to no avail.&nbsp; Never leave your dog unattended or tied up if you cannot see it, especially if it is a smaller, pure breed since those are sought by the bastards thieves.&nbsp; One day I came home and my lady was crying and she told me that she had open the back door and Hercules ran like hell.&nbsp; I was so upset, I couldn&#039;t believe this happened just months after I lost my Mimi.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get any dogs for many years until about 4 years ago when I moved to Holliswood.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all find ourselves feeding our food to our pets, which can be bad because there are many things you shouldn&#039;t give to them.&nbsp; I found a really interesting article a while back and just found a similar one that talks about what not to give your pets.&nbsp; I was surprised and while sometimes I still give my dogs foods I eat I am very careful what&nbsp; do not give them. The web link follows the list.</strong><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 15pt;" class="bbc_size">Items to avoid &amp; Reasons to avoid</span> </div> <br /><br /><em><strong>Alcoholic beverages Can cause intoxication, coma, and death. <br /><br />Baby food Can contain onion powder, which can be toxic to dogs. (Please see onion below.) Can also result in nutritional deficiencies, if fed in large amounts. <br /><br />Bones from fish, poultry, or other meat sources Can cause obstruction or laceration of the digestive system. <br /><br />Cat food Generally too high in protein and fats. <br /><br />Chocolate, coffee, tea, and other caffeine Contain caffeine, theobromine, or theophylline, which can be toxic and affect the heart and nervous systems. <br /><br />Citrus oil extracts Can cause vomiting. <br /><br />Fat trimmings Can cause pancreatitis. <br /><br />Grapes and raisins Contain an unknown toxin, which can damage the kidneys. There have been no problems associated with grape seed extract. <br /><br />Hops Unknown compound causes panting, increased heart rate, elevated temperature, seizures, and death. <br /><br />Human vitamin supplements containing iron Can damage the lining of the digestive system and be toxic to the other organs including the liver and kidneys. <br /><br />Large amounts of liver Can cause Vitamin A toxicity, which affects muscles and bones. <br /><br />Macadamia nuts Contain an unknown toxin, which can affect the digestive and nervous systems and muscle. <br /><br />Marijuana Can depress the nervous system, cause vomiting, and changes in the heart rate. <br /><br />Milk and other dairy products Some adult dogs and cats do not have sufficient amounts of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the lactose in milk. This can result in diarrhea. Lactose-free milk products are available for pets. <br /><br />Moldy or spoiled food, garbage Can contain multiple toxins causing vomiting and diarrhea and can also affect other organs. <br /><br />Mushrooms Can contain toxins, which may affect multiple systems in the body, cause shock, and result in death. <br /><br />Onions and garlic (raw, cooked, or powder) Contain zoologists and disulphide&#039;s, which can damage red blood cells and cause anemia. Cats are more susceptible than dogs. Garlic is less toxic than onions. <br /><br />Persimmons Seeds can cause intestinal obstruction and enteritis. <br /><br />Pits from peaches and plums Can cause obstruction of the digestive tract. <br /><br />Potato, rhubarb, and tomato leaves; potato and tomato stems Contain oxalate&#039;s, which can affect the digestive, nervous, and urinary systems. This is more of a problem in livestock. <br /><br />Raw eggs Contain an enzyme called avidin, which decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin). This can lead to skin and hair coat problems. Raw eggs may also contain Salmonella. <br /><br />Raw fish Can result in a thiamine (a B vitamin) deficiency leading to loss of appetite, seizures, and in severe cases, death. More common if raw fish is fed regularly. <br /><br />Salt If eaten in large quantities it may lead to electrolyte imbalances. <br /><br />String Can become trapped in the digestive system; called a &quot;string foreign body.&quot; <br /><br />Sugary foods Can lead to obesity, dental problems, and possibly diabetes mellitus. <br /><br />Table scraps (in large amounts) Table scraps are not nutritionally balanced. They should never be more than 10% of the diet. Fat should be trimmed from meat; bones should not be fed. <br /><br />Tobacco Contains nicotine, which affects the digestive and nervous systems. Can result in rapid heart beat, collapse, coma, and death. <br /><br />Yeast dough Can expand and produce gas in the digestive system, causing pain and possible rupture of the stomach or intestines. </strong> </em> <br /><br /><br />http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1659&amp;aid=1030 (http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1659&amp;aid=1030)

				<strong>Milk Biquits are supposed to be low calorie...my dogs don&#039;t like MOST of that stuff.&nbsp; They eat human food&nbsp; (well, we cook human food without the spices and mostly meat SOME FIBER).&nbsp; They get a lot of exercise so I haven&#039;t worried about their weight (I should work out with them...LOL).&nbsp; Is he/she getting sufficient exercise?<br /><br />Here&#039;s a good article about nutrition for pets (do as I Say Not as I do...LOL&nbsp; :D)<br /><br />http://www.2ndchance.info/dogfood.htm (http://www.2ndchance.info/dogfood.htm)<br /><br />AND THIS ONE CAN BE FUN...&nbsp; http://www.helpihaveadog.com/ (http://www.helpihaveadog.com/)</strong>

				Hi Thanks for your links.. She has a large yard and does run around all day, plus she has three floor&#039;s of stairs she goes up and down. She is active for the most part. And only two years old. Ive started cooking for her, boiled chicken, no skin, Steamed Broccoli and carrots, an occasional egg, fat free cottage cheese, and for dinner she gets the diet wellness brand. 1/2 cup people food&nbsp; in the am. and 1/2 cup dog food at night. But when she is alone, i do give her a few bisquits ( well 5 or 6 for the day, but they are the small ones)in that plastic kong toy to keep her busy. She never gets table food, but always appears to be starving to death. Always begging. She is a Puggle, and I&#039;ve seen a few huge ones,so i know the consequences of her being overweight. But shes gaining, not losing!!!

				Sometimes people are not considering their dog&#039;s diet. This is really important to make our dog healthier and fitter.

				I know it&#039;s a typo, but it says onion and garlic contain &quot;zoologists&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the list! And it breaks my heart to hear about your dogs being taken.

My dog is overweight also and I give her 1 large dingo(chicken or beef flavored) bone every other day. They are great for the dogs teeth.<br />&nbsp;On the package it says that it&#039;s mostly fat free,however they are made in China.<br /><br />The problem is that my dog isn&#039;t getting the right kind of exercise,she goes for a walk 2x a day,but hardly does any running.<br />I do take her to Juniper Valley park 2-3 times a week and spend about 2 hours,but there are a lot of breaks in between,chasing and staring at squirrels,etc.<br /><br />I was listening to a pet talk show on the radio recently and the talk show host said that he only gives rawhide bones that are made in America only.
