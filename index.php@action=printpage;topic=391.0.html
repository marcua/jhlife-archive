				Just bought a place in JH and am moving in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait!&nbsp; While I&#039;m not going to do any major renovations right now, I&#039;ll likely start updating slowly over the next year.&nbsp; These boards have been extremely helpful and I&#039;ve learned a ton about the neighborhood.&nbsp; So in regards to home improvement, does anyone have recommendations for the following:<br /><br />1) locksmith<br />2) electrician<br />3) general contractor<br />4) hardwood floor guy<br />5) tile guy<br />6) plumber<br />7) any other home improvement contractors you can recommend (molding, skim coating, etc. [I know general contractors do this, but if you know if any specialists, that would be great too])<br /><br />Any sage advice when dealing with contractors before, during, and after renovation would be appreciated too.&nbsp; Thanks so much, in advance, for any help!&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t have any direct answers for your questions, because I&#039;m just beginning to think of doing this myself.&nbsp; But here&#039;s a resource that may be helpful (or possibly just interesting)...&nbsp; Brownstoner, a Brooklyn-based real estate and home renovation website, has a section called &quot;Reno Blogs (http://www.brownstoner.com/renoblogs/),&quot; where people post photos and describe their progress on major renovation projects.&nbsp;

				I am also sorry to not provide answers, only more questions. I was logging on to post similar questions and was quite surprised to find a thread created fewer than two hours earlier. I have just purchased an apartment in western Jackson Heights. Before I move my furniture in, I want the apartment spackled and painted, and the wooden floors scraped and polished. I have <em>no idea</em> which companies to contact. Are there painting and flooring companies used by very many residents to which I can get a referral? Or simply good, reliable ones in the general area?

				To begin to answer my own question, I&#039;ve found a couple of resources over at Apartment Therapy.&nbsp; There are a couple of actual recommendations here (scroll down, names and numbers are in the last 4-5 comments):<br />http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/open-threads/open-thread-345-023829<br /><br />I searched for &quot;Jackson Heights contractor&quot; in Apartment Therapy and this was another one of the links that came up -- a contractor listing (no comments confirming the company&#039;s reliability, though):<br />http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ny/contractors/gardy-boyer-cangard-construction-co-001389<br /><br />There are some other resources at AT but I can&#039;t go through every search result right now.&nbsp; Work.&nbsp; Boo.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hopefully some people with beautifully renovated apartments have some suggestions as well....&nbsp; Thanks!

				Katie,<br /><br />You&#039;ve asked a great question, and hopefully people with some good recommendations for you will speak up soon!<br /><br />But until then, I recommend searching the archives of the JHFamilies Listserv (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jhfamilies) (you&#039;ll need to join first if you haven&#039;t done this already).&nbsp; There is a lot of good advice to be found there.

				I hope so too.&nbsp; I got a couple of recommendations from a coworker who lives in JH and is the board president of her tiny co-op.<br /><br />Joseph Locksmith (I think that&#039;s the name) on 37th Ave. (I think), 718-779-0617.&nbsp; She says they&#039;re good and has used them before.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t called them yet but probably will within the next three weeks and will definitely let you know how they are.<br /><br />My coworker also recommended a couple of hardwood floor guys.&nbsp; She only gave me first names and phone numbers, and I don&#039;t think she has any firsthand experience with them, so I&#039;m not going to post them until I actually meet them and get estimates -- basically so I know I&#039;m recommending legit people.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the mean time, I&#039;ll subscribe to the JH Families Listserv and check out the info there.&nbsp; Thanks for the tip!<br />

				Having just went through three contractors, I can tell you who to stay away from.<br />I also have several other recommendations of people we didn&#039;t use because they were too pricey for us, but they might be good for you.<br /><br />1) locksmith - Joseph Locksmith on 37th Avenue (our co-op uses them exclusively)<br />2) electrician - None I can recommend, stay away from Jay Dionysius (JCCG)<br />3) general contractor - Depends on your budget and Scope and how much you care about quality versus price.<br />4) hardwood floor guy - 1800WOODFLOORS.COM (located in Astoria)<br />5) tile guy - the GC should do this.<br />6) plumber - Anthony Paseggio - 718-639-5190<br />7) any other home improvement contractors you can recommend (molding, skim coating, etc. [I know general contractors do this, but if you know if any specialists, that would be great too])<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t recommend splitting the work up amongst sub-contractors unless you have ALOT of time to do the oversight yourself. You think you&#039;ll be saving money, but it will be a far worse stressful headache than you can imagine.<br /><br />-From An Architect<br />Send a private message if you&#039;d like to talk further about contractors.

				I would also suggest that you ask your building super for recommendations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Supers might have some specific skills or training, and might appreciate some extra money taking on special projects.&nbsp; Or they might have friends or family or other connections.&nbsp; They probably know who has worked on other apartments in the building.<br /><br />Your super knows he is going to look you in the face a few times a week from now until either you move or his job ends, so chances are he wants to start out on a good foot.&nbsp; He will also be hoping you really appreciate him, and show your appreciation during the holidays.&nbsp;

				I just renovated my kitchen.&nbsp; It was a nightmare.&nbsp; I fired the first contractor and had to hire a new one plus an electrician to redo the contractor&#039;s electrical work.&nbsp; But now that it&#039;s done I can say I was happy with the licensed electrician, the granite installer and the guy who did my hard wood floors.&nbsp; And the second contractor did a good job considering he had to redo a lot of the first guys work which I think is always more difficult than starting from scratch.&nbsp; I have to stress that a year ago I had my floors done based on my best friends recommendation and I thought those people did a horrible job.&nbsp; The point I&#039;m making is this: sometimes it doesn&#039;t matter if your friends loved or hated them... the job they do for you is all that matters.<br /><br />Electrician: Pete 347-539-6986<br />floor guy: Cary&nbsp; 347-219-1719<br />granite installer: Caesar 646-235-4669 (he has the worst voice mail recording EVER... don&#039;t be put off by it... he sounds like an idiot but he&#039;s really a great granite guy and very honest.<br />Tiles:&nbsp; I only go to Nemo tiles in Jamaica although there&#039;s International Tile over on 21st in Astoria.<br />Second contractor: Esad 917-674-0434<br /><br />First contractor&#039;s name was Sadok.&nbsp; He&#039;s Israeli (I only say this as a reference point in case any one ever comes across him...

				Katie, also some advice from what I just went thru with my kitchen: most of these guys ask for cash.&nbsp; &nbsp; I gave 1st contractor&nbsp; 2/3 cash up front. He came highly recommended by a friend so I felt safe.&nbsp; When I fired him and had to redo most of his work, I just lost that money and had no recourse to get any of it back.&nbsp; Most of the guys who do general contracting work don&#039;t usually <span class="bbc_u">offer</span> to do contracts or deal memos.&nbsp; The only one who did was the licensed electrician.&nbsp; &nbsp;And since a lot of these guys come recommended thru friends you may feel, like I did, you don&#039;t need a contract.&nbsp; I was wrong.&nbsp; I lost about $6,000 because of work that had to be redone.&nbsp; It was a costly lesson.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though they prefer cash, they will take checks.&nbsp; Pay by check so you have proof in case you need it and have even a hand written contract of work to be done and what the cost will be for your own protection.

				You made a very important point, Buddy!<br /><br />Word of mouth and good will towards friends is fine, but I want something written down now. <br /><br />The excuse of: well if you pay by check I will have to charge you tax is getting pretty old.

				So the need for a locksmith came a lot sooner than I had anticipated.&nbsp; I got locked <em>in</em> my apartment today.&nbsp; The doorknob and lock have been on the fritz since I moved in.&nbsp; This morning the lock literally broke in my hand as I unlocked it to leave for brunch.&nbsp; I tried to call Joseph Locksmith but the guy whose number was given as the emergency contact on Joseph&#039;s answering machine said he was &quot;on vacation&quot; and couldn&#039;t help me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Joseph&#039;s answering machine did not give any other emergency numbers so I Googled &quot;locksmith Jackson Heights NY.&quot;&nbsp; I called several of locksmiths and finally got an answer at the Google result: A 24 Hours Local Locksmith (718-651-2613); the receipt the locksmith gave says Auto Lock A 24 Hour Emergency Locksmith Service (1-800-380-2345). <br /><br />The locksmith that came to save me was extremely nice and helpful even though he arrived nearly 45 minutes after he said he would.&nbsp; He opened my door and spent about an hour replacing the entire doorknob/lock mechanism.&nbsp; The downside: it cost a pretty penny -- several (emphasis on <em>several</em>) hundred dollars.&nbsp; I understand that it&#039;s a Sunday, an emergency, etc., and he did tell me the price of everything he was doing before he did it, which I greatly appreciate, but the price was still a shocker.<br /><br />Anyway, most importantly, my dog and I can leave the house now!&nbsp; Hopefully the next time I need a locksmith will be on a planned weekday.

				What are the benefits/drawbacks to replacing a fusebox with a circuit breaker box? How much does such a procedure usually run?<br /><br />My fusebox only had 3 circuits.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around breakers all of my life until I moved to JH so I was rather fascinated to see one, as if it were a quaint paleolithic artifact.&nbsp; Gives the place character, kind of.<br /><br />My instinct is to cast it away under the banner of modernization but everything old is not necessarily automatically bad, is it?

				Fuse boxes vs circuit breaker:&nbsp; the difference is how the electricity is distributed so you don&#039;t blow fuses. Circuit breakers are safer and stronger. I replaced my old 3 fuse box with a circuit breaker when I redid my kitchen. I put my fridge and my microwave on their own designated fuse which is a big plus.&nbsp; And I have a couple of extra fuses in case the building ever upgrades the electricity.&nbsp; That&#039;s not likely but I&#039;m ready just in case.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s always worth doing.&nbsp; The cost also included the rewiring of my kitchen the adding more outlets for the appliances.&nbsp; The licensed electrician had a couple of workers with him and charged me $1200.

				I&#039;ve been in correspondence with NYC Native and he seems to be really on the mark. I looked at over a dozen pictures of his work, and based on that I&#039;d recommend him to anyone.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if I was too cynical about the posting. Too many readings of the Real Estate Broker postings I think.<br /><br />Actually glad this all occurred because now I feel good about his work. If you&#039;d like, I will privately email the pictures.

				My wife &amp; I just rennovated a 3 br coop here which was probably not touched since it was built back in 1953.&nbsp; There was a lot to do, and we came out of the experience very pleased with 3 of the contractors who we worked with:<br /><br />Electrician:&nbsp; Einstein Electric (718) 274-7600. Did great work fixing a ceiling lamp, wiring our kitchen appliances and installing an outlet.<br />Plumbing:&nbsp; Skillman (718)457-7229.&nbsp; They moved a drainpipe, removed a heater and hooked up or dishwasher.<br />Carpet/Floor/Tile: Hamiloton Carpet (718) 899-3610.&nbsp; They did our carpets, wood and tile floors and tile backsplash in the kitchen.&nbsp; Have a very nice showroom in Maspeth too.<br /><br />All of these guys did a great job, were polite, courteous and trustworthy.&nbsp; The Electrician&#039;s prices seemed a little on the higher side, but nothing that would break the bank and he is very accomadating to your schedule, and in my opinion worth paying a few extra bucks.<br /><br />I have a few others I dealt with who I wouldn&#039;t reccomend, but I won&#039;t take the time to slag anybody here.<br /><br />Good luck with the rennovations. It was a trying undertaking for us, but we love the outcome.<br />

				Does everyone know the saying about construction/renovation?<br /><br />You can have it:<br />a) Good (i.e. quality, design, etc)<br />b) Cheap<br />c) Fast<br /><br />Pick two of the above, because you can&#039;t have all three.<br /><br />IKEA tends to be the closest you can possibly get to all three. They have Good designs, but not so good quality. They are definitely cheap and it usually only takes 2-4 weeks to arrive, which is definitely fast!<br /><br />I recently did two kitchens. One was an IKEA kitchen and the other was a kitchen similar to WoodMode and was about 3-4 times as expensive. The IKEA kitchen still looks like brand new, while the WoodMode kitchen is looking extremely beat up. Both kitchens are occupied by young families of four (i.e. children under the age of 3).<br />

				<strong>You can do whatever you want dear.&nbsp; Obviously porcelains are great and easy to maintain.&nbsp; Wood floors are very pretty in kitchens, specially if your floor and cabinets match.&nbsp; Unfortunately they will require more maintenance if you spend lots of time in the kitchen.&nbsp; Some of the engineered floors have ceramic or ceramic like inclusions that make the surface super durable.&nbsp; Make sure the floors are tight and well sealed so water isn&#039;t a problem.&nbsp; If you do use the kitchen a lot note that you may want to place a small mat by the stove or sink so it wont wear as much.&nbsp; In my opinion do what you like.&nbsp; If pipes bursting or water leaks are a real possibility than warping also will be.<br /><br />In this apartment below I used reclaimed wood and I finished it with a couple of extra coats of polyurethane before the final gloss finish.&nbsp; I liked it and so did lots of people but many also had the same concern, water damage.&nbsp; If you keep up with basic maintenance it wont be a problem.&nbsp; If you have gaps in the boards pay special attention or even consider some silicone before your finish coat. If you do have spills dry it up right away and fix all leaks promptly.&nbsp; Oak will do well in your kitchen but stay away from the softer woods like pine and cherry since they are much softer and a hard working kitchen will put some real wear on them. Don&#039;t wax or oil your floors if you will use it in a kitchen, always use polyurethane since it will handle the drama much better.</strong><br /><br /><div align="center">(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/IMG_1970.jpg?t=1242009834)</div>

				Thanks Native!&nbsp; You&#039;re always so helpful and funny at the same time dear.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Water damage is my primary concern, and one of the people I spoke with also recommended oak if I decided to go ahead with wood flooring.&nbsp; Another option I may explore is cork.&nbsp; Hmmm.....&nbsp; I may need to bust out a few bottles of wine for that one!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Cork tends to be good in kitchens because if you drop something, it bounces. But, it also is more susceptible to water damage than an oak floor would be. <br />So...

I&#039;m unable to take any new work for now and I don&#039;t usually do paint jobs as stand alone.&nbsp; If you have to do patch and repair work careful because you may end up looking worst.&nbsp; If you have to patch and repair walls might as well consider lightly skim coating the entire walls...just so it looks nice.&nbsp; &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!&nbsp; :laugh: </strong> &nbsp;
