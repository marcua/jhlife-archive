					Dear Neighbor,<br />Many of our older and at-risk neighbors are frightened to leave their homes and to go out in public given the COVID-19 outbreak.<br />As a community, we must stand together and help our neighbors. Before this virus spreads further, we should arrange to have phone numbers of those who are most impacted.<br />I live on 90th Street and am happy to run errands. Feel free to reach out to me at 646-210-4495.<br />I call out to others to join to build a strong network.<br />Nuala

					There has been a lot of discussions recently about building diversity into our schools.&nbsp; While JH is a diverse place, out schools are missing a lot of that diversity, because many newer, more financially secure families are sending their children to richer and whiter schools outside of the neighborhood.&nbsp; This is happening even though we have great local public schools.&nbsp; The Department of Education is holding a forum TONIGHT to hear what our neighborhood want when we say diversity, integration, and equity.&nbsp; This is an invitation for the entire neighborhood to speak about what they would like to see in their schools.&nbsp; Please come to IS 230 tonight at 6 PM and have your voice heard.<br /><br />6 PM, Monday, Oct. 29<br />IS 230 at 73rd Street and 34th Ave.<br /><br />The entire community is asked to participate.<br /><br />Nuala

					&nbsp;I am looking to start a co-working co-op with 10 people sharing the space in October.&nbsp; <br /><br />The space will offer a sense of community to break the isolation from working alone at home; you will have office benefits (copier, printer, fax, internet/wifi, cable, and landline), a mailing address that is not your home address, amenities like a fridge full of healthy snacks, and of course coffee.&nbsp; The monthly fee will cover all the expenses such as insurance, electricity, cleaning, office supplies, trash collection, ect.&nbsp; I have not decorated yet as I wanted to take into account the different users needs.&nbsp; I expect it will have desks, a meeting area (couch and chairs) to hold a meeting.&nbsp; I also want it to be flexible to hold large meetings as needed.&nbsp; The best part of the space is that is also has a roof garden with a great view, which is great for relaxing and hosting meetings.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you are interested, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:NualaODohertyNY@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">NualaODohertyNY@gmail.com</a>. Tell your friends as it would be great if we could get a fun group together to work together.<br />
