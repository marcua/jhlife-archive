					Hey, I&#039;ll settle for something simple.&nbsp; Burgers and beer.&nbsp; Novo tried too hard, I think, to be upscale.&nbsp; A good Irish Pub would do fine there.&nbsp; Live music and booze (just my preference.)&nbsp; Hope it&#039;s not another Peruvian chicken place.&nbsp; I love Peruvian chicken, don&#039;t get me wrong, but after having 20 in our neighborhood I think it&#039;s overkill.&nbsp; If I had the money, however...

					I have been in contact with Dromm&#039;s office over the past year and he is going to put together a committee of locals to look at rezoning.&nbsp; I was asked to be on the taskforce.&nbsp; His office did say, however, that this is not the best environment to work in.&nbsp; The present Mayor&#039;s office is not keen on rezoning and are very pro-developer.&nbsp; My feeling is there is development and there is &quot;development.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s important we have a say over the character of our neighborhood and not just let market forces rule and define where and how we live.&nbsp; As I said in an earlier post, I have no objection to development along Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Because the blvd is so wide tall buildings would seem less out of place.&nbsp; There is a quality of life issue here.&nbsp; It was because many in our community made noise (old farts? young farts?) that we will have more green space (thanks Danny Dromm.)&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with refocusing development in our community.&nbsp; We live here, the developers don&#039;t.&nbsp;

					Personally, I am disappointed in a number of things about this building.&nbsp; First, I think the design looks like they went to WalMart and bought it.&nbsp; It is so unoriginal and cheap looking.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cookie cutter of the building across from it.&nbsp; Adds nothing to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Most importantly, I am disappointed that it was approved and feel the Landmarks people let us down by allowing this building.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t they have built something smaller, fewer storeys?&nbsp; Because of its size it will mean more residents thus more congestion on the streets in the hood.&nbsp; It is a rental unit which probably also means they will have more residents per apartment unit and more drain on services.&nbsp; These will not be first choice apartments.&nbsp; This is strictly about getting as much money per square footage.&nbsp; I&#039;m also disappointed because this sets a very bad precedent for 37th Avenue.&nbsp; I can forsee all the sites along 37th Ave. being rezoned for tall buildings.&nbsp; I&#039;m not against tall buildings per se.&nbsp; They can be built along Northern Blvd where there is a wide street and their impact would be minimal.&nbsp; This building is just an example of cowboy zoning.&nbsp; The irony is that all these compromises that the developer agreed to were probably already what they expected anyway.&nbsp; Developers always expect to have to cut back on their plans so they ask for the most and get what they expected all along and then brag that they &quot;compromised.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					At Council Member Danny Dromm&#039;s Town Hall meeting the other night he said that the 37th Road plaza is only in its first phase.&nbsp; There are plans in the second phase to beautify it.&nbsp; He also has said the restaurants on the plaza will be encouraged to offer outside cafe style service and seating.&nbsp; A friend of mine from Astoria once said that the problem with Jackson Heights was there were no outdoor sidewalk cafes.&nbsp; Also, seeing as we have so little greenspace in the neighborhood, it is very important that we keep our new building construction to one-story.&nbsp; At least we can maintain air and light and an open feeling and feel a little less congested.&nbsp; I wish we had the option of a large tree-filled public space.&nbsp; We will have to make do with these smaller but vital open spaces.&nbsp;

					For those of you interested in how our neighborhood develops--i heard Danny Dromm speak last night and he has guaranteed us that he is pursuing zoning changes for JH along 37th Ave. to maintain the low-rise buildings now in existence.&nbsp; He wants to ensure no more 6 story buildings go up along 37th Ave. as has just occurred.&nbsp; He did say, however, it is a long process but he is committed to following it through.&nbsp; Those of us seeking to maintain the architectural character of the neighborhood and who support sensible development will be helping him out in any way we can.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					The owners of the building on the corner withdrew their application for a variance.&nbsp; I&#039;m certain they will reapply at some point.&nbsp; I am not against development of JH but there needs to be a partnership with the community.&nbsp; My favorite street in JH is 82nd bet. 37th &amp; Roosevelt and the reason is it has character.&nbsp; Low buildings on a tree-lined street.&nbsp; It&#039;s commercial and pleasant (albeit congested).&nbsp; I&#039;d hate to see those low building replaced with 6 or 7 story buildings.&nbsp; I will be approaching our council member et al to see if rezoning can be done for this area along 37th Ave.&nbsp; If developers want to raze these one-story buildings fine.&nbsp; But, if I had my way, they&#039;d only be allowed to replace these buildings with one or two story new constructions.&nbsp; When the apartment buildings were built off 37th with unobstructed views there was nevere a concern that construction along 37th would ever be an issue.&nbsp; And it wasn&#039;t until that huge building on 37th &amp; 82nd was built.&nbsp; That spurred the Landmarks movement in JH.&nbsp; Now we need to continue to put in place sensible regulations to, not stifle growth, but to manage it so we maintain our quality of life and the wonderful character of our neighborhood.

					Well Steve I&#039;m glad you&#039;re happy in your co-op.&nbsp; Sorry we can&#039;t get a developer in to brick over your windows.&nbsp; Sure you wouldn&#039;t mind.&nbsp; But seriously, development is fine.&nbsp; It&#039;s great actually but there needs to be regulated so ensure a positive impact on quality of life issues.&nbsp; If it&#039;s just build anywhere as much as possible than we live in an impersonal chaotic neighborhood (well, there will no longer be a neighborhood).&nbsp; Case in point:&nbsp; If it wasn&#039;t for community minded people like Jane Jacobs, Robert Moses would have gotten his way and put the highway right through Greenwich Village.&nbsp; Many people thought as you at the time and felt development should not be regulated.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also think the LPC caved in.&nbsp; This new building is not a compromise.&nbsp; A compromise would have been a three story building with the top two floors set back.&nbsp; Basically, what the developer did (and what most of them know to do) is ghey asked for the most and worked back (compromise ) to what they actually knew they would get anyway.&nbsp; Everyone then thought, how nice they compromised.&nbsp; And BTW, historical is all relative.&nbsp; There are some wonderful 1950s buildings that should be saved and will one day be 300 years old.&nbsp; We need to start somewhere.&nbsp; Anyway, we will be fighting to get more reasonable and sensible zoning and a more active LPC.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

					I am not &quot;complaining&quot; about the building going up.&nbsp; That&#039;s a done deal.&nbsp; Too late.&nbsp; I am &quot;complaining&quot; because this sets a precedent.&nbsp; Yeah, there are many 6 story building along 37th.&nbsp; And when walk those blocks they are cast in shadows.&nbsp; The whole point is not to continue the mistakes of the past.&nbsp; This trying to squeeze as many apartments into a much space as possible is a neo-tenament mentality.&nbsp; Many of us who have apartments set back and overlooking 37 Ave will have their light cut off.&nbsp; If you knew anything about the history of JH you&#039;d know that this neighborhood was created as an escape from the airless &amp; lightless tenaments that were devouring the city.&nbsp; Now we are slowly becoming that. If you walk down 82 bet. 37 &amp; Roosevelt you see how open it feels.&nbsp; When they built that monstrosity on 37th &amp; 82nd that spurred the landmarks movement for our neigborhood.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t we get a say in how our neighborhood develops or just leave it to chance?&nbsp; I feel terrible for the building behind that newly constructed building on 37th.&nbsp; Those apartments have lost all their light and their property value has plummeted.&nbsp;

					This sets a disturbing precedent.&nbsp; I&#039;m mystified how the owners got a variance to build this building.&nbsp; 37 Avenue is not like Northern Blvd.&nbsp; There you could have 6, 7 or 8 story buildings and you wouldn&#039;t notice them.&nbsp; 37 Ave. is a narrow street.&nbsp; It is light and airy because there are many one-story buildings.&nbsp; We don&#039;t have much public space/parks of any size in this neighborhood but we do (did) have light and air.&nbsp; If this trend continues we will begin to see 37 Ave look like an airless, dark canyon.&nbsp; Not to mention that all the buildings in back of these one-story buildings will have their light shut-out and their property value go down.&nbsp; I have nothing against tearing down the old and putting up the new but not when it is bigger and more intrusive.&nbsp; We must stop this trend now and not let any ANY more 6 story buildings on 37 Ave.&nbsp;

					It&#039;s the best thing to happen to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I love how it has grown and expanded.&nbsp; My wish (a selfish one at that) is that it expands even more and into Travers Park.&nbsp; I would love to see Playstreet and Travers Park completely overtaken by the Greenmarket.&nbsp; It is only one day a week, afterall, and it has become vital to the community--and, the more it expands the more popular it will become.&nbsp; Thanks to all those who have done such a great job with it.&nbsp;

					We&#039;re looking at apartments in the complex of towers on 85th Street near 37th Ave., specifically the single building on the west side of the street at 35-50 85th.&nbsp; Does anyone have any info on this building--the good, the bad, or the ugly?&nbsp; We already live in JH and are only moving a short distance and looking for a two bedroom and a terrace.&nbsp; We have seen a couple of apartments in this building that we like.&nbsp;

					A problem I have is all this car talk.&nbsp; I grew up in car country and, when I moved to NYC, I sold my car.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t missed it since.&nbsp; The idea of being car-dependent in NYC is crazy.&nbsp; It seems people want to live this suburban lifestyle in an urban area.&nbsp; We really need to push for better and more frequent mass-transit.&nbsp; More pedestrian-only streets, more bike lanes, more car-restricted areas.&nbsp; In many European cities cars are discouraged.&nbsp; People own cars but they are used for travel outside the city not for driving around town.&nbsp; Gas prices are very high which discourages driving.&nbsp; Because more people are out walking, using public transportation, biking, these cities feel more like villages.&nbsp; The necessities tend to be closer because people walk or bike to the stores.&nbsp; Now, don&#039;t get me wrong, I like cars and enjoy driving but we rent cars when we want to leave the city or need one for special occasions.&nbsp; My two cents.

					What I would like (personally) is a YMCA there.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think we need more apartments.&nbsp; The streets are already sometimes congested.&nbsp; I feel bad for those in the adjacent apartment building who will be losing their views.&nbsp; How about a two or three story Y?&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; As for the planned first floor commercial space, I worry we&#039;ll get another bank or pharmacy.&nbsp; They seem to breed like weeds in a garden.&nbsp; &nbsp;
