					Hi folks! We are taking the plunge and adopting a kitty next week. One of the biggest questions: where will he do his business? I&#039;ve been reading a gazillion litter box reviews on Amazon and my eyes are spinning. So I thought I&#039;d turn to my expert neighbors, who also face the same cat-in-apartment question. Which litter box do you use, do you like it, and why? Any other tips for keeping your apartment free of that litter box stink?

					Hi all,<br />I&#039;m thinking of adopting a cat (if only I can convince my other half). I&#039;ve been looking on Petfinder.com and there are so many different organizations in NYC. I&#039;d like to adopt from a reputable organization that can do a good home match--we have two small kids so would need a cat with a rather friendly, dog-like personality. Can anyone recommend an animal rescue/shelter/adoption agency, either here in Queens or elsewhere nearby?

					Hi JHers!<br />I&#039;m wondering if anyone who lives in Boulevard Gardens in Woodside could share your thoughts on the co-op. I definitely need to check it out myself, but I&#039;m interested in hearing from anyone with kids. Is this the kind of place where we could get in trouble if our kids step on the grass, or is it more family-friendly? How is the community: tight-knit, indifferent, live-and-let-live? Would deeply appreciate any assessment on the pluses and minuses.

					Thought you all would be interested to hear about a new book published by a former Jackson Heights neighbor, Marie Mockett. Although she and her family moved back to San Francisco last year, I still consider her a local author (we were in the same new moms group). Her memoir, &quot;Where the Dead Pause and the Japanese Say Goodbye,&quot; was just reviewed in the NYT Book Review:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/books/review/where-the-dead-pause-and-the-japanese-say-goodbye-by-marie-mutsuki-mockett.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/books/review/where-the-dead-pause-and-the-japanese-say-goodbye-by-marie-mutsuki-mockett.html?_r=0</a>

					I&#039;d love to hear your advice on this situation. Our neighbor across the hall is a widow and lives alone. She is a sweet lady and we always chat when we see each other.&nbsp; She used to feed the neighborhood&#039;s feral cats, but she recently had some heart problems and now is mostly homebound. <br />Now her main hobby is smoking. She was always a heavy smoker, but after her health problems it&#039;s gotten worse. She stays inside and smokes day and night. She rang another neighbor&#039;s doorbell at 1 AM, looking for matches. The smoke drifts through our window and under our front door. We&#039;ve got a baby and four year-old; we don&#039;t want them to get asthma. I also worry she&#039;ll set something on fire.<br />I&#039;m not looking to get her evicted. Ideally I&#039;d like her to get some help, though apparently she refused to have a home health aide, probably because they&#039;d ask her to stop smoking. We&#039;ve tried talking with her and she apologized for the smell, but didn&#039;t stop.&nbsp; There&#039;s probably no chance of her quitting at this point.<br />So I&#039;m looking for tips! Know a great senior services organization that works well with the stubborn homebound? Ways to clear the air of cigarette smoke or prevent it from entering the apartment?<br /><br />

					I know, heretical question, but one to which I&#039;ve recently been giving some serious thought.&nbsp; My family loves this neighborhood, but if prices continue rising the way they have for the past couple years, we won&#039;t be able to make the leap from renting to owning. That&#039;s not a complaint, just a fact. I&#039;m sure we&#039;re not the only ones.<br />These are the things I love about JH: 1) Diverse mix of ethnicities, education, life experiences 2) Concentration of professionals in creative and education fields 3) Lots of families 4) Active and expanding venues for civic engagement 5) Walkability &amp; access to public transportation<br />I&#039;d love to hear suggestions for neighborhoods that have some of these Jackson Heights-ish virtues but are more affordable. Norwood, in the Bronx, is one I&#039;ve been exploring recently. For now we&#039;re interested in staying in NYC, but are open to other suggestions (Pittsburgh? Poughkeepsie?)<br />Thanks guys.

					So I just found out that, as usual, I am behind the 8 ball. In this case it was preschool signups: apparently in order to snag a free full-day seat at 82nd St Academics you had to be standing in line at 4 AM on Tuesday morning. Oops, missed that one. I understand why people don&#039;t trumpet these things (why get more people in line competing with you)? Still, anyone have suggestions for anticipating the next sign-ups? Which other local preschools have free full-day UPK, and do I stand a snowball&#039;s chance in hell of getting a spot?

					We are looking for a two-bedroom or even a very large one-bedroom apartment to rent starting October 1, somewhere in the $1500-$1800 range. Tenants would include me, hubby, and two (adorable! well behaved!) small children, no pets. We have steady income and good credit. Access to some kind of outdoor space would be ideal. Range anywhere between Woodside Ave. and Northern Boulevard, 70th St. to 82nd St. Please DM me if you have any leads. Thank you!

					I&#039;d be curious to hear any feedback from those of you who have lived in or visited Glen Oaks Village, out in northeast Queens. How is the community? Love Jackson Heights but starting to consider other parts of the borough, as the real estate market is so tight here.

					A week ago I popped into one of our local South Asian grocery stores for a few bananas and ended up also buying a bag of yummy-looking golden lentils called Kesari Dal. Last night, before dumping them in a pot with a bunch of curried vegetables and chicken, I did a quick Google search to make sure I wasn&#039;t missing any special cooking tips. Here is what I found:<br /><br />From The Times of India:<br /><br />“Historically, the link between Kesari dal (Lathyrus Sativus) and the incidence of lathyrism, a form of paralysis that affects the lower limbs, has been well documented. This has been attributed to a particular neurotoxin ODAP, which is a form of an amino acid. The research currently being undertaken is in the form of animal trials to find examine this link and to verify it.”<br /><br />From the FDA Poisonous Foods Database:<br /><br />“Lathyrism is a major health problem in India, especially during drought-related famines. The severely crippling and potentially lethal disease results from eating large quantities of so-called &quot;poison peas&quot;… known in India as kesari dal.” <br /><br />Apparently cultivation of Kesari Dal is still banned in India, though farmers are lobbying to have it lifted. The Times of India article notes that scientists are trying to develop a non-toxic variety of the dal, though they haven&#039;t been successful yet.<br /><br />So…&nbsp; although I probably wasn’t going to paralyze my family by feeding them a single serving of Kesari dal, I was still surprised that this banned pea is openly sold in our neighborhood.&nbsp; I’m curious if anyone else has any experience with this form of dal—is there any way to prep it so that it’s not poisonous?<br /><br />And note for adventurous eaters: maybe best to Google that new food before putting it on the dinner table.
