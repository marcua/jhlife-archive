				I&#039;m so sad that they are gone. I&#039;d love to know the full story. Both ERT and Growing Farm were shuttered without notice overnight. That&#039;s not just being chased out by the landlord. Was there any warning? How much did the rent go up? Or was there a refusal to continue the lease to these tenants? Who is the landlord, and did he just inherit the buildings? <br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to support both of these favorite establishments.&nbsp;

				We don&#039;t know if it happened without any notice. It was a surprise to the public, but probably not to the business owner. Whatever the issue (late rent? rent increase? who knows?) I would think it was not a sudden, unexpected event.&nbsp;

				Re: the comment about the landlord just wanting the rent with no &quot;complaints&quot; or other issues--can the landlord abruptly evict a leaseholder because of &quot;complaints&quot; or other issues? I would think not. Isn&#039;t a lease an agreement that if the rent is paid and the tenant complies with whatever laws he/she has to comply with--the tenant gets to stay in the space? This comments seems quite speculative--how do we know that the rent and taxes were being paid and that the tenant was somehow being annoying to the landlord--which is the theory portrayed in the comment?

				&quot;how do we know that the rent and taxes were being paid &quot;<br /><br />That may be the case.<br /><br />I did some reading earlier on this issue. I don&#039;t remember where, maybe nyc marshal&#039;s web site; I looked at a few.&nbsp; I read that lessee&#039;s do not have protections like tenants in residential housing court. If the business is not complying in accordance with the terms of the lease (of which we don&#039;t know), then, well, below is what popped up in a quickee internet search just now: <em>A lessee is a person who rents land or property from a lessor. The lessee is also known as the &quot;tenant&quot; and must uphold specific obligations as defined in the lease agreement and by law. The lease is a legally binding document and if the lessee violates its terms he or she could be evicted.</em> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lessee.asp<br /><br />There&#039;s no reason to think it was abrupt, either<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to blame anyone. I want to make that clear. Whatever happened, I don&#039;t think anybody did anything intentionally harmful or inappropriate.

				Jeanette&#039;s last note seems like a very plausible scenario, particularly for El Rico Tinto. i believe they bought an existing lease four years ago, and perhaps were in renegotiation mode that went wrong. i also have no insider info, but an expired lease (with possible unwillingness to renegotiate terms) is certainly possible.

				From a post on JH Families:<br /><br />As we suspected, the landlord raised the rent above and beyond the capacity of El Rico Tinto to&nbsp; pay and so they had to close.&nbsp; It is likely that this is the reason that nearby Growing Farm had to close as well.

				Eddie--well, if it&#039;s just &quot;nonsense,&quot; why have I been reading about this as a major issue in NYC?

I don&#039;t know why you think this happens rarely. I can think of quite a few spaces in JH that did sit empty for years, or are still sitting empty. Can&#039;t everyone who lives here?

				If a building owner has no mortgage, having bought the property when it was comparatively speaking a steal, wouldn&#039;t it be possible that profits are great enough to not care about a full house, so to speak? Considering taxes, licenses, repairs, energy bills, and fines that the LL pins on the tenants, what would, generally speaking, costs be compared to rents? From my viewpoint, owning a building in NYC where upkeep does not appear to be stellar, looks like a big money maker without huge costs.<br /><br />I once had a business and reported a loss in the first year. It helped me a lot; I don&#039;t remember the details--it being many years ago--but I remember being pleased with the outcome.

				Hassle for both sides. And both sides are running out of money in the time it takes all the government agencies to get their approvals going. So then they are paying 8 months rent, running out of money, and if they quit then the landlord has to deal with evicting them. I want them as much as anyone but NY makes it so difficult for everyone. <br /><br />---<br />I am really unsure though about how to keep rents down. Why wouldn&#039;t they ask the most they can get? I think they need even more incentive to fill the space. If I ever go for a grad degree, I will do a dissertation that cost is just pain tolerance and people in NYC are willing to put up with more pain than anywhere else.

When money is gone, they file a loss statement.<br /><br />That&#039;s interesting. <br /><br />and then the landlord becomes ultra picky in who is offered a lease.

				My guess is that in the future restaurants will become hybrids.<br /><br />Like EATALY in the Flatiron district/World Trade Center.&nbsp; Where you can dine and also buy produce/groceries as well. <br /><br />My prediction is that successful restaurants will become &quot;destinations&quot; on some level.&nbsp; For instance, where you can eat in and also buy the ingredients as well to create your own. Mini-Eatalys.<br /><br />I think some Latino bodegas are already doing that here in Jackson Heights on a basic level?&nbsp; Tacos in the back and produce in the front?<br /><br />But also the idea of the bookstore/cafe has been around for ages. That&#039;s a hybrid.&nbsp; And many cafes are now workstation/cafes. Set up to be that hybrid.&nbsp; Like mini-WeWorks. <br /><br />For instance that Japanese restaurant next to Letys called OKAWA that always seems pretty empty.&nbsp; They should open a Japanese grocery in the restaurant as well.&nbsp; Then I bet it&#039;d be far better patronized. <br /><br />I would say that to be the restaurant biz a person has to passionate about food.&nbsp; And then it&#039;s their vocation.

				Maybe there was no increase but just an inability to make ends meet and continue to pay the existing rent. As someone pointed out, it&#039;s hard to evict tenants and takes a long time to go through the legal channels. I have no idea how it might differ for commercial tenants, but my impression is that sometimes rent is not being paid for a long time before an actual eviction can occur. I&#039;m not sure what it takes to end a commercial lease--would it just be non-payment of rent? Or could the landlord end the lease for other reasons?

As someone pointed out, it&#039;s hard to evict tenants and takes a long time to go through the legal channels. I have no idea how it might differ for commercial tenants, but my impression is that sometimes rent is not being paid for a long time before an actual eviction can occur. I&#039;m not sure what it takes to end a commercial lease--would it just be non-payment of rent? Or could the landlord end the lease for other reasons?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah it might be sudden for us but maybe the restaurant owners saw it coming or had received notices. Violating a clause in a lease agreement can lead to eviction and landlords can decide not to renew an agreement. But given that there was a marshalls notice, it must have been an ongoing matter that was taken to court.
