				Three adjacent storefronts on 74th St are empty or will soon be empty: a sari shop, Mumbai Grill (which closed several months ago), and Arman Jewelers (which is moving several stores down).&nbsp; This is either an amazing coincidence on a block that is otherwise thriving, or some big change is afoot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Could Patel Brothers be expanding?&nbsp; &nbsp;Another large retailer moving in?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or are there redevelopment plans for this property?&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find anything on ACRIS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anybody know?

				I wrote a piece a few months ago about retailer downsizing....along with radio shack and staples, BN was at the top (bottom) of the list. they plan to get rid of one-third of their locations by 2020, and are closing about 10 per month around the US. <br /><br />while I prefer indie stores - I could practically live in the Strand - barnes and noble has always been reliable as a place to go when I needed to find a specific book.

				they probably can still sell books, just not enough to withstand constant rent increases.<br /><br />apples and oranges, admittedly, but i work near Pearl River Mart, which has been a favorite housewares/asian product store for decades. they currently pay $100,000 per month for their space, and the landlord just upped it to $500,000 per month. per MONTH. they&#039;re closing up shop after 40-some years.

				I mean, the rent can&#039;t help, but Barnes &amp; Noble is losing money everywhere, not just in NYC. Big box bookstores can&#039;t make money in a world where people come in and hang out there and then make most of their purchases on Amazon.
