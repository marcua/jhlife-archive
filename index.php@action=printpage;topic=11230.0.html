				Just moved to JH in November. It&#039;s been a crummy winter to try to run but if the snow ever melts I want to be ready. What are the best running routes for avoiding people and traffic? Looking for a good 3-4 mile loop. I&#039;m starting at 84th and Roosevelt. <br /><br />It seems like even though running east-west means crossing streets more frequently, there are fewer cars so I can (carefully) run through the red lights without having to stop. I know, I know!<br /><br />Running east on 35th was pleasant but up-hill return was kind of a drag. Is running west flatter or is JH at the top of a hill in both directions?<br /><br />Also: if anyone knows of any running clubs or is looking for a running partner, let me know!

				There may be some good info in this old thread Running Routes in Jackson Heights &nbsp;(http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=702.0)<br /><br />I didn&#039;t re-read it so I&#039;m not sure what it says, but I do know that crossing Northern Blvd will lead you into an area that is much less congested with cars and people (like 31st Ave and 30th Ave).<br /><br />Welcome to JH!

				Everyone&#039;s body is different, but my personal experience is that Jackson Heights is terrible for running. I&#039;ll take the train to other parts of Queens to run, like Roosevelt Island, Flushing Meadows, Astoria Park, indoor/outdoor tracks. The pavement and asphalt is poorly maintained and sloped, which is the primary contributor to the runner&#039;s knee I&#039;ve experienced in the past.

				I don&#039;t know of any neighborhood running groups, but I do know that the LIC YMCA has a running group: http://www.ymcanyc.org/lic/ (http://www.ymcanyc.org/lic/)<br /><br />Also, here is a list of running groups from NY Road Runners website: http://www.nyrr.org/causes-and-community/local-clubs/club-listing (http://www.nyrr.org/causes-and-community/local-clubs/club-listing)<br /><br />I agree with Shelby2, once you get north of Northern Blvd. the streets are much less congested. <br /><br />One of my favorite places to run in the area is along the Flushing Bay waterfront, which is part of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. There is no traffic to deal with and you have the view of the water, but it is a bit of a longer run from JH. To get there, you can head east on 35th Ave (towards Corona), turn left on 99th St (north) until you reach Astoria Blvd, cross Astoria Blvd to 27th Ave, and continue north east on 27th until you reach the end and you will find the entrance to the park across Ditmars Blvd. If you run there, all along the waterfront, and back it&#039;s probably about 7 miles. There are other entrances as well, but I&#039;m not sure which streets they are on. <br /><br />(http://www.ayleebits.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/parkmap.jpg)<br /><br />Flushing Bay Promenade is the area on the left of the map (north)

				I found a shorter route to the other entrance to the Flushing Bay Promenade. It is still 2 miles to get there from where you are, however:<br /><br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/358077173 (http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/358077173)<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Is there any interest in making a better option here for runners, walkers and strollers? Maybe not so much for serious runners but as a community effort to get more residents moving. Maybe a loop using 34th avenue and up to 35th <br />or 37th Ave. going from the BQE/69th st to Junction Blvd. Some communities have full or partial street closures to encourage participation in warmer weather. We could make it a fun seasonal run/walk/track ...<br />&nbsp;Any thoughts?

				I can see 34th Ave but can&#039;t spot the names of the streets where you make the turns. I&#039;d like to try it as a walk.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11230.msg54995.html#msg54995">Quote from: Matt on February 13, 2014, 07:46:14 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I found a shorter route to the other entrance to the Flushing Bay Promenade.

				Try the full screen version:<br /><br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/358077173/ (http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/358077173/)<br /><br />The map works similar to google maps - you can zoom in, scroll, etc.

				I run on 34th Avenue in the bike lane, up to 110th, back down to 70th, and back to my starting point. Easy 4 miles. Not too interesting, but straightforward. In the morning there&#039;s not too much traffic.

				I haven&#039;t quite moved to the neighborhood yet (next month!) but have been spending some time at our new place and running through the neighb to explore it. Really, any of the streets that aren&#039;t Roosevelt or 37th seem fine to me, and I&#039;m really excited to try the flushing waterfront and corona park paths. I&#039;ve been googling for a running group in the area too and there doesn&#039;t really seem to be anything. Should we start a &#039;new residents&#039; one??
