			Does anyone have experience dealing with DOB to share? Any tips and experiences would be helpful. Especially if it is related to condo/coop renovations on things like knocking down non-bearing walls, changing from a bathtub to a shower, and updating electrical.<br /><br />How was the process? How long did it take? Any anecdotes could be helpful.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />DD

			I am not aware that one needs to involve the DOB to renovate a coop or a condo--removing walls, updating electric, removing a bathtub, etc, the things you mention are done routinely without permission from the DOB in my experience. You would usually need to get your plans reviewed by your building management/coop board, but that would not involve the DOB.

			I thought it was not needed either but apparently it is. I don’t understand why approval is needed, especially on non load bearing walls. If anyone knows please share your expertise. It would at least made me feel better.<br /><br />The management company says it needs DOB approval to remove any wall. <br /><br />You will need permission if you want to take more than half of any wall. Here is some info copied from the DOB website:<br /><br />2. Non-fire-rated and non-load-bearing wall, permanent removal in Group R occupancies. In Group R occupancies, where the cutting away and permanent removal of any portion of a non-load-bearing, non-fire-rated partition is limited to the lesser of 50% of a given wall surface or 45 square feet in area.<br />Exception: a permit shall be required where the cutting away and permanent removal of any size occurs in a dwelling unit satisfying either of the following conditions:<br />i. The dwelling unit is located in any of the following areas**:<br />a. Special Hudson Yards District<br />b. Preservation Area P-2 of the Special Garment Center District<br />c. Special Clinton District<br />d. Special West Chelsea District<br />e. Greenpoint-Williamsburg anti-harassment areas in Community District 1, Borough of Brooklyn; and<br />ii. the dwelling unit is within a single room occupancy multiple dwelling††<br />**<br />The permanent removal of a portion of the partition resulting in a change in the layout of rooms within a dwelling unit shall constitute a “material alteration” in accordance with Zoning Resolution sections 93-90 and 96-01. Any “material alteration” to a dwelling unit located within the “anti-harassment areas” as provided for in Zoning Resolution Sections 23-013, 93-90, 96-01, and 98-70 shall constitute an alteration in accordance with the Building Code and, therefore, require a building permit.<br />††<br />applicable, a Certificate of No Harassment in accordance with section 28-107.4 of the Administrative Code.<br />Such work shall be considered an alteration and therefore require a building permit and, where applicable, a Certificate of No Harassment in accordance with section 28-107.4 of the Administrative Code.<br /><br />https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/rules/1_RCNY_101-14.pdf

			But I do not want to divert from the objective of this post. If a permit is needed or not, I am not an expert. <br />I just wanted to chat with people that went through this process since this could be my case. <br />Please DM me. I am very interested in any tips or stories. <br /><br />Best,<br />DD
