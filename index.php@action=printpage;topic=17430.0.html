				Good morning, neighbors! I am excited to invite you to connect with Animal Behavior Arts, Ltd. ABA, Ltd. is a new startup that may surprise you.<br /><br />There are a couple of important considerations:<br /><br />(1) We genuinely love people and pets&#039;<br />(2) We strive to do the right things by people and their pets<br /><br />These two points are the foundation of why we get out of bed each morning. The Human-Animal Bond is a real force in our lives, and we are always on the lookout for opportunities to augment The Bond, while we support our Members in achieving their goals. As you might imagine, many of the people who contact us have or want companion animals. Dogs, in particular, are huge around here.<br /><br />We believe that we can solve pretty much any problem. We have a superpower, which we will discuss, later.<br /><br />We embrace people, regardless of whether they own companion animals or not. So whether you have a dog, a cat, a Macaw, or you dislike animals - we have you covered. If you are a Veterinarian, a landlord, a property manager, or you are someone afraid of dogs, we&#039;d like to hear from you.<br /><br />What we care most about is that we share a common outlook. If you agree that people and companion animals are important parts of our urban communities and that they are deserving of love and respectful treatment, then you are probably our kind of people.<br /><br />If you believe as we believe, you are probably a Member, but let&#039;s speak and discuss making it official!<br /><br />Please write us at ABArtsLtd@gmail.com, even if you just want to say &#039;Hi!&#039; If you prefer a return call, text, or Facetime, please let us know.<br /><br />Stay warm,<br />Dennis P. Owens<br />Animal Behavior Arts, Ltd.<br />Facebook: @AnimalBehaviorArts &amp; our associated Facebook Group - ABA, Ltd Members&#039; Space<br />Email: ABArtsLtd@gmail.com
