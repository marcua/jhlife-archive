				I recently had some delicious vegan/gluten free desserts at an event I attended and then again at the Vegetarian Festival at the Metropolitan Pavillon.&nbsp; The owner&#039;s company&nbsp; is called The Love Kitchen.&nbsp; She is currently thinking about opening a shop, most probably in Manhattan or Brooklyn.&nbsp; I suggested she checked out JH.&nbsp; You can find her on facebook or her website.&nbsp; Perhaps if she knew there was interest here, she would consider this area.&nbsp; I suggested that she go talk to the owners of Juju&#039;s and Expresso 77 as they seem to be doing well.

				i have a few friends in the area who&#039;d be regular customers. it&#039;s definitely a niche market, but if the offerings are good -- as in good for baked goods, not &#039;good, considering it&#039;s vegan&#039; -- i would bet she&#039;d have good luck.

				I really wanted to go to that event but had other obligations. I can say that I would happily keep that place in business!!! I do bake my own but it is sometimes too much work. I really like the sweets at red bamboo in the village but they come from a place in PA. Their strawberry shortcake is amazing. Also there is the Cinnamon snail truck-if you&#039;re lucky to be near them or have the time/patience to wait on the insanely long line. JH deserves a vegan place... I am on board...
