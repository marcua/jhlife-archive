			Does anyone have a dog walker that they like and trust? We&#039;re looking for someone who can periodically take our dog for his 3pm walk if we&#039;re not available.

			Where do you live? 70s or 80s?&nbsp; I can think of a few people who might be interested.

			abee I left a message for the girl who lives in my building to see if she&#039;s interested.<br /><br />And I asked my dog sitter (who&#039;s retired) but she said no.&nbsp; We live on 87th Street and she doesn&#039;t walk far but she takes my dog and hangs in her back yard with him.&nbsp; I thought if you lived RIGHT HERE she might be interested.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, as soon as I hear back from Antoinette, I&#039;ll let you know.
