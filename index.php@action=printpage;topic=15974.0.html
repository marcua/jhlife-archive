They loved the building’s original architectural details, its well-maintained garden and the basement music studio where Roy could play guitar. Its close proximity to the 7 and other trains was also a bonus.<br /><br />“We really wanted this building,” Bolton, 47, said.<br /><br />Their offer of $332,000 was accepted, but they soon hit a snag when trying to secure a mortgage, and their appraiser valued the apartment at $20,000 less than what they agreed to pay.<br /><br />The discrepancy between what the couple was approved to borrow from the bank and the actual price of the apartment delayed their mortgage and forced them to re-negotiate with the seller for a lower price.<br /><br />Read full article: https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170207/jackson-heights/bronx-queens-home-sales-appraisals

				With 1 bedroom sale comps north of 400k existing in the neighborhood, this should not happen. The unit in question closed in November of 2016, when median price of 1 bed sales in our portfolio was 350k-375k. There were at least 5 comps available at the time that appraisal was conducted. Looks like the seller made a $6,000 concession to save the deal instead of having the buyer reapply with another lender or seeking a new buyer. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The seller&#039;s agent tried providing those comps to the appraiser, but he refused to take them. When we challenged the appraisal, we provided better comps to the bank, but they refused to change the appraisal. We probably should have found a new lender, but the appraiser waited eight weeks before actually doing the appraisal and we were a little panicky.

				This happened in my neighborhood as I was selling and moving from Brooklyn. Appraisals weren&#039;t keeping up with the market. So I did two things:<br /><br />1. I put together a comps packet and handed it to the appraiser BEFORE he did his work. I was careful not to be pushy, I just said: &quot;Hi, I&#039;m the homeowner and I have some background information that might be helpful. My contact info is in there if you have any questions.&quot; Then I got out of his way. I had heard from a friend who is a developer that you can be more persuasive before the appraiser has done the work. No appraiser is going to want to make a correction to work that has already been done, as they may feel it reflects poorly on their work.<br /><br />2. We received multiple offers, so I told the prospective buyers that we&#039;d pay special consideration to anyone willing to waive contingencies. One buyer agreed to waive the mortgage contingency up to a certain dollar amount. That amount was enough to span the gap.<br /><br />

				Out of curiosity, when looking at the square footage/pricing of comparable properties, do appraisers simply go by the square footage claimed in the listing? I&#039;ve noticed that some listings seem to exaggerate square footage. For example, just by adding up the dimensions in this floorplan it doesn&#039;t seem to come anywhere close to 825 sf:<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/building/37_34-85-street-jackson_heights/32<br /><br />It seems like exaggerations like this would seem to put buyers of units that are more accurate about square footage in the listing at a disadvantage during the appraisal process. (Such as, for example, this similarly priced listing: http://streeteasy.com/building/37_20-81-street-queens/4e )

We are buying a place that is advertised as 1800 sq ft. It&#039;s actually 1650 sq ft when you count the space the interior walls take up.

That&#039;s quite different from the 825 they are claiming. Interesting question about comps.
