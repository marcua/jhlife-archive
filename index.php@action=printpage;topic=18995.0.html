				From website:<br /><br />&quot;Helena Fusión Restaurant NYC was established in 2018 by two enterprising brothers who are lovers of fine cuisine and excellent food service. Throughout the years in Colombia, there has been an increased evolution in Colombian cuisine and service. We want to bring this new concept to Jackson Heights and the rest of NYC. Combine a touch of Colombian modernity, high-quality service standards, and a great atmosphere, add top-notch cocktails, and now you have a 5-star dining experience that anyone would be pleased to enjoy.&quot;<br />

				Every time I walk by Helena it looks a little bit more open. The latest has been TVs turned on and a platform outside seemingly for outdoor dining. Are they finally going to be opening? I hope so based on the decor alone! It looks like it could be really good so I&#039;m eager for it to open.

				it looked like they were building one of those 100 percent indoor &quot;outdoor&quot; seating areas -- plywood, plexiglass, no air circulation, thus not considered outdoor. Leaf, on Roosevelt, has one too. they&#039;ll be fined if they keep it up. just noting, not calling 311 or anything.

				We tried this place for the first time tonight and it was delcious. The coconut shrimp and pineapple was devine and the arepas with guacamole were also v good with a a top notch margarita. Excellent service and presentation. We sat outside to avoid covid and the super sized TV screens inside. I would highly reccommend.

				^they&#039;ve fully enclosed their outdoor space, no? which pretty much makes it the same as indoor dining. What type of ventilation is there to encourage the dispersal of the small droplets that linger in the air a person infected with Covid but asymptomatic would dispel while talking and laughing?
