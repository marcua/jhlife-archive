					Attention Queens writers craving community! <br /><br />Newtown Literary Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting prose and poetry in Queens, in partnership with Lewis Latimer House Museum, is now offering free creative writing classes ONLINE during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />Our first virtual workshop in our “Writing on Race &amp; Immigration” series with Lewis Latimer House Museum will be led by <strong>Meher Manda</strong> on <strong>Saturday, April 18th</strong> from <strong>2:30 p.m. – 4:30 p.m</strong>:<br /><br />&nbsp;“<strong>Mapping Your Home in Poetry</strong>”<br /><br />In this generative class for poets, we will look at home not simply from the vision of nostalgia, but from a lens that draws the visceral details, the metaphorical possibilities, and the essayistic memories of childhood, community, and family, to arrive at a juncture where poetry about home can be both personal and generational. We will read, embrace, and examine the work of poets such as Sharon Olds, Ilya Kaminsky, Ariel Francisco, and Warsan Shire, and use generative writing prompts to refine our use of home and its myriad components in our writing. <br /><br />Our guiding question will be: What about home sneaks its way into my work, and how can I nurture and support that meaning through poetry?<br /><br /><strong>RSVP to receive instructions on how to join the virtual workshop here: <a href="http://tiny.cc/NewtownApril18" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://tiny.cc/NewtownApril18</a>.</strong><br /><br />Meher Manda is a poet, short story writer, culture critic, and educator from Mumbai, India, currently based in New York City. She earned her MFA in Fiction from the College of New Rochelle. She is the author of &quot;Busted Models,&quot; a chapbook of poems published by No, Dear Magazine in Fall 2019. Her work is forthcoming and has appeared in Hobart Pulp, Epiphany Magazine, Glass Poetry, Los Angeles Review, Lumina Journal, and elsewhere. She is one-half of An Angry Reading Series in Harlem, New York.<br /><br />This program is in partnership with Lewis Latimer House Museum and made possible, in part, with funds from the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature, as well as with public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council. <br /><br /><br />For more information, please visit <a href="http://newtownliterary.org/writingclasses" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">newtownliterary.org/writingclasses</a>.

The three lines of a haiku are open to great tales of mythological creatures or the falling of an autumn leaf from a maple tree. In this workshop, you will learn the ins and outs of haiku form, read a few examples of how it&#039;s been done from Ancient Japan to modern New York City, and craft a handful of haikus of your own! We&#039;ll share our work as a class and then have some fun scrambling our poems to make new meaning from each other&#039;s words.<br /><br />Tori Ashley Matos is a Queens native and recent graduate of NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Their work has been featured in Newtown Literary and many other publications and is forthcoming in Sinister Wisdom’s 2020 anthology.<br /><br />This program is made possible, in part, with funds from the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew M.

I first tried them around Cartagena and the northern coast of Colombia — maybe that’s why they’re hard to find? Most establishments here seem to hail from Medellin or Bogota. <br /><br />Or maybe I just haven’t searched hard enough?<br /><br />Any tips or suggestions on where to look are appreciated.&nbsp; <img src="Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Attention Queens writers—both experienced and new-to-writing: the last in a series of free creative writing classes this season taught by the best writers in Queens!<br /><br />Newtown Literary Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting prose and poetry in Queens, in partnership with Queens Library and City Council Members Daniel Dromm and Elizabeth Crowley, is offering free creative writing classes. <br /><br />The next class will be led by Eugene Lim on <strong>Saturday, May 5th</strong> from 2:30 p.m. – 4:30 p.m. at <strong>Queens Library in Jackson Heights </strong>at 35-51 81st St: <br /><br />“<strong>Allow Yourself to Write!</strong>”<br /><br />Are you stuck in your writing? We&#039;ll try different exercises in spontaneous writing to unlock our powers of observation, memory, and abstraction. One reason writers get stuck is that they are trying to reproduce someone else&#039;s idea of a story. We&#039;ll explore different ideas of narrative and hopefully expand our notion of story.<br /><br />Eugene Lim is the author of the novels <em>Fog &amp; Car</em>, <em>The Strangers</em>, and <em>Dear Cyborgs</em>. He is a high school librarian and lives in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />One student in each class will be randomly selected to receive a copy of the instructor’s latest book!<br /><br />For more information, please visit <a href="http://newtownliterary.org/writingclasses" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">newtownliterary.org/writingclasses</a>.

In this workshop we will explore these questions through writing exercises and discussion. All genres welcome!

					On Saturday, <strong>May 6,</strong> Pushcart Prize nominee <strong>Joe Okonkwo</strong> will lead a free writing class for adults at the beautiful new <strong>Elmhurst</strong> branch of the Queens Library (86-07 Broadway), from <strong>2:30pm-4:30pm</strong>.&nbsp; This is the end of the season for Newtown Literary&#039;s free writing class series with Queens Library, so don&#039;t miss it!&nbsp; These classes are free and available to all thanks to generous support from NYC Council Members Daniel Dromm and Elizabeth Crowley.<br /><br />Novelist Victor Lavalle says, “In the end, what’s any good reader really hoping for? That spark. That spell. That journey.” In order to create that journey in a way that truly transports the reader, the writer must pay as much attention to place as to the plot and the characters. Specificity is key. This session will show participants how to delve deep and make a story’s setting as complex and intriguing as its characters. <br /><br />Okonkwo&#039;s novel, <em>Jazz Moon</em>, was published in 2016 and is a finalist for Publishing Triangle&#039;s Edmund White Debut Fiction Award and Lambda Literary&#039;s Best Gay Fiction Award. His stories have appeared in <em>Best Gay Stories</em> and<em> Storychord</em>. <br /><br />For more information, please see Newtown Literary&#039;s website: <a href="https://newtownliterary.org/writingclasses" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://newtownliterary.org/writingclasses</a>.<br /><br />No registration is required -- hope to see you there!
