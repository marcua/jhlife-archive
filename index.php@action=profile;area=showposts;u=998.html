					~Cannelle Patisserie~<br />waht can i say, im extremely speachless.... every1 already said all they had to say about about the bread and cakes and danishes....<br />i just love how they transformed JAY DEE&nbsp; into waht it is now<br />i can focus more on the food then then look at the floor to see if im going to fall over a crack.<br /><br />me and my friends used to come to the store all the time whe it 1st opened&nbsp; we were highly addicted to just about everything at the store.<br />i havent been there in quite a while, and when i came back i was delighted to see that they have new selections to their ever growing list of paistries.&nbsp; they have such a big list that they need to get new larger refrigerated showcase. i&#039;v noticed sometimes they place certain deserts behind otehr deserts on the lower shelves.&nbsp; seems like ther are really cranking out stuff in the back.<br /><br />&nbsp;have to say&nbsp; the faces at the store&nbsp; changes from time to time...&nbsp; new people behind the counter&nbsp; every few months or so.&nbsp; i dont know what others have to say about this&nbsp; but i find this a good thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Cannelle patiseries&nbsp; has been good with the food from the start, hands down.<br />the store did get upgraded in term of seating and comfort.&nbsp; a booth instead of chairs, nicer larger pictures and pictures of items they actually sell, the light setting has also changed slightly dimer energy saving lights gives a nice touch to make it feel relaxed, and i&#039;v also observed that seasonal items placed on the window bar changes with special events and time of year. props to whom ever is incharge of the decore.<br /><br />when the store 1st opened it was chaotic and quite hectic,&nbsp; cant be blaimed&nbsp; due to the holliday season.<br />the service was not as greate as everything else on the store at the time. lines were getting longer faster then the people behind the customer can keep up.<br />despite waht everyone else thing i blaim the lackness in speed to the manager&nbsp; who used to be at the register.&nbsp; i&#039;v noticed he got his workers to complete an order for him while they were busy with another customer. he seem to arrange the type of systematic function they have in dunkin donuts. where each person is assigned to a certain duty and that duity only. when he is not there&nbsp; each person behin takes their own customer and fulfills their needs acordingly. tah sory of working system does not seem to work well with cannelle. it seem to work much smoother then what the front manager seemed to have in mind.&nbsp; i no longer see him there and it seems like a good change.<br /><br />i have gotten familiar with each face behind the counter, and i have to say&nbsp; cannelle management is doing an exceptional job to an EXTENT hiring people.&nbsp; as we all know each individual is different. but when working with customers patients, positive attitude, and being well informed is a major key in business.<br /><br />it&#039;s been almost 1 year since the opening&nbsp; and i have seen dozens of faces. some i was quite pleased to see gone, and others were delightfull.<br />whenever i go to canelle i look for 4 of my favorite employees.&nbsp; from least favorite to most favored<br />1st is a south-asian (guessing bangali) lady who usually wors in the morning, she is an agressive worker but my god&nbsp; she definately knows waht she is doing.<br />2nd&nbsp; is a hatian girl (katia)&nbsp; she has a nice smile and delightfully takes a customers order with propercare and service. im proud to say she serves me at cannelle<br />3rd is KAt&nbsp; (not sure of her background) spontanius and had a kiddy like charm. works well in a team and individually. knows her stuff to all she is doing. unfortunately she has moved back into the kitchen where she helps the chefs prepair the delicious cakes.<br />4th&nbsp; and lastly (my personal favorite cannelle employee) vinoth, also goes by nemo. WHAT A GUY.... he as impressed me and other customers on numerous occations. HE is by far the perfect example of a cannelle employee. He knows how to deal with troublesome customers, helps out his coworkers, and watches over the new and unexperienced workers, and knows the discription of all items they serve. i once asked him how bitter or swet the lomon square is, he replied &quot;tast of the lemon square is like, being able to look at the sun withought having to squint at it&#039;s magnificance&quot;.&nbsp; hearing those words i baught a few with no further questions. another time i asked about the fig hazel nut bread, he replied &quot;u know how u have a smile when u put something delight full in ur mouth, the 1st time i had the fig hazelnut bread,&nbsp; my smile had it&#039;s own smile&quot; and to my surprise when i tasted it myself&nbsp; he knows what heis talking about.&nbsp; (personally i find him charming in the way he talk and how he looks). i had&nbsp; the opportunity to talk to him outside cannell oneday,&nbsp; can anyone believe taht he is actually 19, he looks and speaks at a much more mature and sophiscated level. i could have thought he was atleast 25.<br /><br />moving on......<br /><br />cannelle&nbsp; i dont know what i would do without u............. im expecting to see more chains pop up in many other places
