					I know much of this thread is tongue-in-cheek, but who remembers how just a few years ago this board was over the moon because of a rumor about Le Gamin considering setting up shop here? (For those who don&#039;t remember, there was a time when their food truck parked at the farmers&#039; market and did a brisk business.)<br /><br />Back then, no one accused such an addition to the neighborhood of being the ugly side of gentrification. <br /><br />Speaking of new eateries, 37th Avenue is getting a new take-out Lebanese place (in the space that used to be the eyeglass store and then was subdivided). I talked to one of the guys and told him how we didn&#039;t have a good shawarma/falafel place. He replied, &quot;I know, that&#039;s why we&#039;re here!&quot;

					This needs to be seconded because anyone who suggests that Roosevelt is not used by families has never walked along it, especially on the weekend during the day. A great deal of the pedestrian congestion is largely due to the high volume of strollers and slow-moving kids out with their families. <br /><br />Yes, <strong>some</strong> places along Roosevelt are involved with nefarious activities but I do believe these places are in the minority. The avenue does take on a different personality at night, but even then, families are out, shopping and eating. <br /><br />I am all for cleaner, crime-free streets, but for that to happen in a meaningful way, the conversation needs to expand well beyond the parameters of this site and its primary users.

					I was at Viva La Comida last night around 6 and then walked west along Roosevelt around 7 and saw no sign of a crime scene. I think the Post got this wrong. Whatever happened must have been up around 90th Street, like Breezie reported.

					This is sad to read. I&#039;ve enjoyed the food there on several occasions. My wife and I ate there with our infant son in tow. I actually think that on the early side of dinner, the bar is an ideal spot to take a kid. I&#039;ve also stopped in to pick up food to take home. But I have to agree with much of what has been said here. Unless you keep tabs on this site, or read a handful of food sites, there is no way to know that the place exists. Alchemy should do more neighborhood outreach/marketing, like hand out flyers at the Greenmarket that play up the connection to John Brown Smokehouse. <br /><br />The idea about including a couple fixed-price sandwiches on the menu is very smart. <br /><br />And they do need to be consistent. The first time I tried to eat there, they were out of everything we really wanted to try, so we got nothing. If I showed up and the place was closed, I wouldn&#039;t go out of my way to return. <br /><br />It&#039;s only been a few months and no business can really establish itself in such a short amount of time. If they aren&#039;t able to stick it out for at least a year, that&#039;s bad planning on their part. Which is a shame, because the BBQ is excellent and a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp;

					For the record, Italian farms didn&#039;t close, it moved into a much bigger space on 37th, close to 82nd Street. Perhaps rent is cheaper in the new space, I don&#039;t know, but the rent for the old space did not drive them out of business.

					We finally made it here this past Friday evening and loved it! Some of the best chicken I&#039;ve ever had. The pork ribs were great too. My wife is not a huge fan of duck, but even she gobbled it up at Alchemy. While &quot;vinegary cabbage salad&quot; is a better descriptor of the coleslaw, the tang and crunch were a really nice balance to all the meaty, fatty goodness. The creamed spinach was also really great, though a bit heavy for me within the context of the rest of the meal. <br /><br />We&#039;re lucky to have this place in the neighborhood. We&#039;ll most certainly make return trips. And really, I can&#039;t say enough about the half chicken - it was amazing!

					JuJu&#039;s has good homemade hummus, and there is no shortage of places in the neighborhood where you can buy garbanzos, tahini, lemon, etc. It&#039;s really easy to make hummus. Pro tip: soak your beans overnight in water that has a tablespoon of baking soda in it.&nbsp; <br /><br />My only real food-related complaint about the neighborhood is lack of a good burger (though I can get excellent ground beef at the farmers market). But in terms of the availability, and variety, of restaurants and markets, if you complain about access to food in Jackson Heights you&#039;re living in the wrong place. And as someone said, it is so easy to get to Astoria, LIC, Sunnyside should you want something like Salt &amp; Fat. <br /><br />It seems to me that there are plenty of people living here with discretionary income and that perceptions of Jackson Heights will change/are changing. I don&#039;t think this means it will become the next Park Slope -- that would be horrible -- but more and more people know about the great apartments, proximity to Manhattan, and amazing food. Just take a look at how the rental rates are going up.&nbsp; <br /><br />

					If I&#039;m in town, I do not miss the Sunday market, no matter the time of year -- it is one of my favorite things about Jackson Heights. I&#039;m going to echo the sentiment that of all the things to complain about in the neighborhood, and there are plenty of legitimate complaints to be made, the vendors in question here are not stealing business and should not be vilified; in fact, they are adding to the Greenmarket&#039;s vibrancy, which is a true reflection of the neighborhood. As mentioned previously, people selling tamales, flautas and elote in no way compete with or detract from the Greenmarket vendors selling produce, dairy, meats, baked goods, honey, juice, etc. <br /><br />Who remembers when the Le Gamin truck used to park on 34th Avenue during the market? Now, they probably had proper permits but I don&#039;t recall anyone ever accusing Le Gamin of stealing business from the market vendors. What&#039;s up with that?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Especially during the summer with the play street, these vendors provide food after the market has ended. I&#039;ve seen farmers eat this food, as well as all the people using the park. I&#039;ve never noticed an accumulation of trash on the corner where these folks set up. As is regularly discussed here, there is far more trash on 82nd Street and around the pedestrian plaza in front of all the legal businesses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Le Gamin is long gone but I wish other food vendors and trucks, whether from Roosevelt Avenue, Astoria or elsewhere, would park for a few hours during the Sunday market. As far as I&#039;m concerned people selling prepared food on the periphery of the market is a mutually beneficial relationship. If you&#039;re scared of getting sick, don&#039;t eat their food. It just means there is more for the rest of us.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Checked out this place last evening and am impressed. Neither a standard produce stand nor bodega, it reminds me of the Parrot Coffee stores in Astoria and Sunnyside, at least in terms of its more Euro-leaning stock. Unlike Parrot it doesn&#039;t sell homemade items, or products in bulk, but there is a solid selection of nuts and dried fruit packaged at some local bulk facility. It complements Trade Fair, Italian Farms and the newly re-opened Polish deli -- an excellent addition to the neighborhood!&nbsp;

					Grady&#039;s Farm will have chicken in the spring. There was one day early in the winter when the farmer brought chickens and the neighborhood bought everything he had. Grady&#039;s is a new farm but starting in the spring it is my understanding that chicken will be available on a regular basis.&nbsp;

					Hi All,<br /><br />I&#039;m a writer and I live in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m working on an article about the Jackson Heights Greenmarket for Edible Queens. It would be great to hear from some of you about the market. The article will appear in the winter issue so I&#039;d really like to know about your experiences shopping at the market last winter and what you&#039;re looking forward to this winter. <br /><br />While it will be cool for this to be a thread, if any of you are willing to be quoted in the piece, I ask that you send me a private message and include your full name (as opposed to a handle). <br /><br />I have no sway with the Greenmarket, so there is no need to ask me about whether or not we&#039;ll get another poultry farmer (though I sure hope we do!). But in the years that I&#039;ve been regularly shopping at our Sunday market, I&#039;ve really been impressed by how much it has grown since going year-round last winter. And talking to farmers and the Greenmarket folks, it seems that our market is a resounding success.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some questions to consider should you want to play along:<br /><br />How does the presence of the market influence your shopping habits? <br /><br />What items are you thrilled to get during the winter? <br /><br />What are your thoughts on how the market functions as a community hub?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;

					For the kind of bar some of you are looking for check out Terraza. It is the kind of place you find in the hip neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and Mexico City, and the LES. Yes, Spanish is the dominant language, but even if you have no Spanish, the young, artsy crowd speaks perfect English. It&#039;s easy to strike up conversations, enjoy the nightly music and pretty regular readings. Things really get going late, but I&#039;ve had lots of fun here on the early side. I&#039;m married, but I can also tell you that the women aren&#039;t shy if that&#039;s a factor for you. <br /><br />What I love about this neighborhood is that it is definitely resistant to the kind of blanket gentrification that has gone down in Brooklyn, or even Astoria. Walk down 30th Avenue between Steinway and 31st Street and it looks like Bedford Avenue. <br /><br />But I also agree that the demand is here for some of the types of places listed above, like Bare Burger or a exposed-wood wine bar. I don&#039;t want scores of these places, but one or two would do gangbusters. <br /><br />Maybe we&#039;ll get something cool in the vacant corner spot on 37th at 81st (I think).
