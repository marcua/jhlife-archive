				Yes, it shows horribly. But if the floor plan was featured one might be able to see beyond the mess. It could be an entry level apartment for someone who wants to own rather than rent and for someone who has a lot of imagination.

I mentioned there could be tenants in it. As far as I know, landlords can’t just go in a tenant’s apartment and start cleaning up their belongings. NYC is very tenant friendly and landlords are not free to enter a tenant’s apartment&nbsp; just because they want to.

				Honestly, I think agency bares a burden on this one. This is not an owner DIY FSBO scenario. This is an AGENCY listing. <br /><br />If you have a property that shows poorly and owner is not able to change anything about it for whatever the circumstances are, why would you go and take flip phone quality photos of a dirty sink, open toiled lid, dirty laundry and a messy room and make them public?! <br /><br />Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident. We have come across many like listings. I remember one that had a Raid can on display in the center. Each is an example of poorly represented client, plain and simple.

				Shelby2:&nbsp; There&#039;s a realtor with 30 years experience and very competent who has a one bedroom listing at the Fillmore that needs a total renovation.&nbsp; The three photos he shows are the front of the building, garden and floor plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;I should also mention that agentarmen is also very highly experienced and competent and works for a respected real estate firm.&nbsp;

				Armen, I understand your intention in trying to educate others on how an agent should not represent a client, but I believe it&#039;s not professional to publicly shame another agent on their listing, especially when their information is noted.

Plus, at least these photos are honest. Some agents use Photoshop to manipulate their images and even use camera tricks to make all the rooms look way more spacious than they are. I&#039;m sure you know what I&#039;m talking about, Armen.

Because I had a budget and knew I couldn&#039;t afford a move-in ready, recently renovated apartment. <br /><br />What&#039;s really egregious is that whoever took the photos couldn&#039;t even be bothered to remove that wadded up paper towel in one of the kitchen shots, and someone thought &quot;no problem with that picture!&quot;

My intent is certainly not to sugarcoat or compliment what is a publicly posted listing and certainly have many opinions of my own, which I&#039;ve tightly reserved. What I&#039;ve laid out is fact. Any feelings or judgements that arise from examination of the fact are natural consequence. I hope that&#039;s something we can agree on. <br /><br />StevenGrey - Photoshop, Lightroom, HDR, Video, high-end cameras are all modern tools which are designed to best show a property, not change it or alter it, or make the image quote &quot;dishonest&quot;. Just the opposite. Those tools are to best show what is there. Believe me dirty dishes in a sink would look equally awful in High Definition :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Shelby2 - I agree with you, a simple floor plan and a facade photo would have been better. Working with the tenant (if rented) and a cleaning service or waiting to list until after the tenant has move out is also an alternative. <br /><br />As a general note, any public post like this that I make, I do not post lightly and my message is not intended to broker community but to general public. I firmly believe, owners can and should expect more from the brokerages they put their faith in and yes, I am occasionally vocal about it :) .

				I think it&#039;s appalling. I share photos like this with my friends all the time whenever I come across them — I&#039;m not in the business, I&#039;m just one of those people who loves looking at real estate photos. <br /><br />I don&#039;t consider that I&#039;m shaming anyone when I do it. IMO the photo takers are shaming themselves if they can&#039;t put a toilet lid down or remove wadded up paper towels before snapping the photo.<br /><br />I agree with all who say post a floor plan, shot of the building front, shot of the garden. It&#039;s a good price for a 1 BR. When I was on the hunt I could overlook a lot of cosmetic defects... but that toilet, yikes, its tough to &quot;unsee.&quot;<br /><br />

				It&#039;s just totally clueless and unprofessional to post these photos of a property for sale. And whoever is the seller must also be totally clueless. How could anyone with any sense think it&#039;s a good idea to show pictures of a dirty, messy apartment when you are trying to sell it?
