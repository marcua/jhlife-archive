				Polly&#039;s much loved owner passed away last Fall.&nbsp; She was taken in by neighbors across from where she lived but they have two small, active dogs who hate her.&nbsp; She has been hiding in the upstairs bathroom, alone, since she moved in.&nbsp; I would keep her but I am allergic to cats.&nbsp; I am going to take her until I can find her a home because I can&#039;t stand that she&#039;s been lonely all these months.&nbsp; (Her owner was my friend.)&nbsp; <br /><br />She&#039;s grey and white striped with blue/green eyes.&nbsp; Sweet and playful (she was with her owner).&nbsp; I think now she might need a bit of tender care to be that happy cat again.<br /><br />You can PM here if you are interested.<br />Rose

				Aww... Wish I could take her but I am maxed out with the pets. She might be in mourning. We took a cat in that&#039;s owner passed and it took her years to come around. If they are older it is so much harder for it to adjust as well. So sad. Hope things work out

				She might be in mourning.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t blame her.&nbsp; Polly went from a home where she was a loved pet to a home where she&#039;s NOT.<br /><br />Bella, any suggestions?&nbsp; I was wondering if I should try Craig&#039;slist.&nbsp; I am going to post a photo at my Vet&#039;s once I have her.&nbsp;
