					Does anyone remember the CFON jingle, &quot;the Heavenly Coffee, better coffee a millionaire&#039;s money can&#039;t buy?&quot;<br /><br />The founder of CFON was a certain Mr. Black. It seems that one night at the cabaret at the Carlyle Hotel he became smitten by an aspiring singer, Page Morton, who later became Mrs. Black and recorded the original jingle that was played on the air for years afterwards.<br /><br />She was a customer of my father&#039;s store and you could say we knew her. Often while she was visiting mother, her chauffer would ride us kids around the block in the back of her limo. We&#039;d raise the privacy window and sing Heavenly Coffee. <br /><br />She would design her own dresses and hats with the help of Balenciaga. Usually something fish tailed and low decollatage always showing the south sea pearl choker with huge heart shaped diamond dangleing from it, that of course Mr. Black had given her.<br /><br />She was actually a sweet person, a bit out of step, and a character of her own creation. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure that many of the old Jackson Heights dowagers, who would ride the 82 Street bus down Fifth Avenue to B. Altman&#039;s - white wrist gloves, pill box hats, and purse perfectly poised in their laps, would have brushed elbows with Mrs. Black in Altman&#039;s. They might even have had afternoon tea there together.<br /><br />These were ladies of another era altogether, and grande dames at that!

					Tonight I was walking my dog. Suddenly and for no apparent reason another dog that was a good distance away made a quick lunge and wanted to attack my dog. Nothing new right? The other dog was able to get to us because it was on one of those retractable 25&#039; cord leashes which of course was unlocked, while the owner was busy daydreaming.<br /><br />Another time I was trying to get to an appointment and again there was a dog on one of those contraptions. The owner was at the curb, another daydreamer, while the dog was busy sniffing at the building&#039;s fence. It wasn&#039;t until I stopped and shot a look at the walker that they even became conscious. We shouldn&#039;t have to play hop scotch to get up the street.<br /><br />Fellow dog owners, <em>please,</em> you aren&#039;t doing your dog, yourself, or the public any favors by using those things. There are too many dangers that can happen in a split second. We&#039;re all better off, and safer, if you stick by the law which says no more than a 6&#039; leash.<br /><br />My dog walks on a 4&#039; strap which means he is close to me at all times and i think we&#039;re both happier for it. Your dog doesn&#039;t need to be wandering all over.<br /><br />Anyone else ever have a bad experience with one of those things?<br />

					One of the most odd things (of many) that I&#039;ve seen here...<br /><br />There is a coin op kiddie ride in front of Met Foods. I was walking by one day and an Indian mother put her kid on the ride. As it began to move the music started to play, &quot;One little, two little, three little Indians... &quot;<br /><br />Mama was keeping time to the music. We both looked at each other, smiled and shrugged!

					Those homes on 75 St are known as the Spanish Towers. It would be wonderful to see them included. There are still a good number of buildings in JH that need to be included be it individually or to extend the historic district&#039;s borders.<br /><br />While the Queensboro Corporation did the major development in the neighborhood, many other buildings also went up at the same time. They were subject to the same criteria enforced by Queensboro and Edward MacDougall. Often enough the architects were the same as hired by Queensboro. These buildings also need to be protected before any more happens to them and the neighborhood in general.

					Funny but underneath all want the same basic things in life. Thank the children. They are the ones that still teach the adults that... different people of different cultures and beliefs all trying to nurture a family as best they can.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing that little story!

					Each of the boroughs has it&#039;s own distinction and flavor. Queens by and large was the last to be developed, having been the farm to the city. Still in all though Queens remains the largest borough in square miles, and a large population that is the most diverse. I think one can easily say that the &quot;average NYer&quot; likely works in Manhattan and lives in Queens.<br /><br />As Manhattan becomes out of reach, run down and depressed neighborhoods throughout the city have been seeing regentrification for years now. Sometimes this is because of the present infrastructure or perhaps the area&#039;s accessability. Nothing in NYC stands still, it never really did.<br /><br />Jackson Heights in and around the &#039;70&#039;s was just about at rock bottom. That was also the same time that the major diversity&nbsp; of the neighborhood began. It was also when the the great shift began from rental buildings to co-ops. <br /><br />The co-ops are what kept this neighborhood from falling apart all together. And the original now.reputation of JH was also not only due to it&#039;s type of planning but also to home ownership.<br /><br />So if anyone wants to complain about regentrification, consider what many of you did here - be it more recently or long ago. We&#039;ve already seen it and been ahead of many other areas for a long time now.<br /><br /><br />

					The real problem is that the airport is on the water. When visibility due to fog or similar conditons gets bad they opt for the over JH route in to land. This can also happen i suppose when there is heavy traffic too. Then the special events like US Open come into it as well. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much that can be done about it.<br /><br />There were times as a kid that I swore i could see a stewardess, maybe even her pearls.
