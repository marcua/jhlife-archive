				OK. My lack of knowledge of the details of Thai food is going to show, but ... we always ordered from Rice Avenue when we wanted things like massaman curry, Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, the boring comfort food that&#039;s available in most NYC Thai restaurants. Since Rice Avenue is now out of business (or at least their Web site is down and their phone is dead), I&#039;ve been calling around but most of the other restaurants in the neighborhood seem to serve a different kind of Thai food (Esan?) that doesn&#039;t have any of these familiar standbys. Zabb definitely doesn&#039;t. Arunee has some of the dishes but not all. That&#039;s all delicious and exciting and stuff, but sometimes you&#039;re tired and don&#039;t want to cook and you just want a massaman curry.<br /><br />Is there anywhere that would deliver to 73rd Street and 35th Avenue that serves the well-known American Thai dishes? Thanks.

				My favorite Thai restaurant Ayada Thai&nbsp; They have many curries including massaman but I wouldn&#039;t call it Westernized.&nbsp; They also deliver.<br /><br />http://ayadathaiwoodside.com/food-delivery/Ayada-Thai-Woodside-New-York-City.5869.r?QueryStringValue=4CBJXEYNn45qKSAyG/zz9Q==

				Ayada Thai on Woodside Ave. in Elmhurst, just past the hospital, delivers to much of JH. We&#039;ve eaten there and ordered take-out. It&#039;s in the same league as Arunee Thai and the former Rice Ave... very good. Here&#039;s a review from the New York Times...<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/dining/reviews/08under.html<br />

				Also a fan of Ayada, but wouldn&#039;t really consider them &quot;Western-style&quot;.&nbsp; They do have the classic dishes you are looking for, though (and many other things...salads are great, although some are incredibly spicy!).<br /><br />They deliver incredibly fast to 73rd St, so the food gets to you in better shape.&nbsp; The menu and quality are similar to Nusara Thai in the shopping plaza further down in Elmhurst, but the speed made us switch to Ayada for our go-to Thai delivery!
