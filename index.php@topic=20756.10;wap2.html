			Jackson Heights Group on Facebook<br /><br />https://www.facebook.com/groups/35851988964<br /><br />It can get wild but at least there are a multitude of many voices on it...including Spanish speaking...so reading it has improved my Spanish. (Including Spanish curse words.)<br /><br />

			Plus...I think the fact the Facebook Group isn&#039;t anonymous is a positive.<br /><br />It makes folks with impulse control or anger control challenges...perhaps think twice...(tho sometimes not!)

			&nbsp;To the Moderators,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for all of your work on the site over the years! It truly has been a neighborhood service. Yes, there are other algorithmic places to post locally but the uniqueness of this site has been appreciated. Sorry to hear of this closing and as some others have suggested, maybe someone/some few will come forward to keep it going. We hope so.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With appreciation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Itsit

			Such sad news. This has been my source of news about JH for years as the amount of news from &quot;local&quot; news sources gets less and less.<br />I never ever use Facebook and now more than ever I have no reason to go there.<br />Thanks for your creation, your work and dedication.&nbsp; You will be missed.<br />

			I understand being tired of doing this, but I hope you have tried to pass it to others.&nbsp; This is a marvelous neighborhood resource.<br /><br />Has someone identified what these other substitute sites are for discussing JH news?
