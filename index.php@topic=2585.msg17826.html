								<div class="inner" id="msg_17780">From Queens Courier: <a href="http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2009/04/22/news/local/doc49ef3e3954554618004993.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2009/04/22/news/local/doc49ef3e3954554618004993.txt</a><br />by Claudia Cruz<br /><strong><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>First candidate forum for District 25<br />Three City Council candidates face off in debate</strong></span></strong><br /><br /><strong>From the tone of the first candidate forum, District 25 incumbent Councilmember Helen Sears has her work cut out for her.<br /><br />â€œHereâ€™s an example of walking the walk and talking the talk,â€ said challenger Daniel Dromm about Searsâ€™ efforts to help the disabled community in the district. â€œHelenâ€™s district office is not even handicap accessible.â€</strong><br /><br />Dromm, a district leader in Jackson Heights, and fellow candidate Stanley Kalathara, a business owner, lawyer, and president of Indo-American Democratic Committee, did not mince words when describing Searsâ€™ work in the district for the last eight years.<br /><br />Sears, who has represented parts of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Rego Park, Woodside, and Corona, spent more time defending her record on issues such as the local economy, education, crime, youth and recreation, and Con Ed, among others, than talking about her goals if re-elected.<br /><br />Sears pointed to her years on the transportation committee in the City Council and how she helped get medallion taxis to become wheelchair accessible. She highlighted her continuous battle for a ramp at the Jackson Heights Post Office and the success of getting an elevator in the 74th Street/Roosevelt subway station.<br /><br />â€œIt took 15 years to get an elevator in there,â€ she said. â€œIt works and it doesnâ€™t, but itâ€™s better than what we had.â€<br /><br />Dromm pointed to his history of standing up for special education students and working with the 82nd Street Business Improvement District to get ramps in front of stores. Stanley Kalathara said concisely, â€œI agree with both and Iâ€™ll do a better job.â€<br /><br />The friendly banter between the three out of five candidates â€“ Alfonso Quiroz and Mujib Rahman did not attend â€“ kept the approximately 50 intergenerational and international crowd engaged. Assemblymember Jose Peralta, who publicly endorsed Dromm this past March, yielded his time to audience questions.<br /><br />â€œWhat are you going to do about getting a high school in the district?â€ asked one person. â€œWould you vote for resolution 245 that grants the right to vote for non-citizens?â€ asked another. â€œWhy did you vote against the lead paint resolution?â€<br /><br />More than once Sears found herself on her own. She said that Ivan Lafayette had led the charge for a new high school but that â€œgeographically weâ€™ve got no space.â€ Kalathara responded that Sears was â€œalways shifting responsibility,â€ and Dromm said that it was important to be creative like building up or consider eminent domain.<br /><br />Both Kalathara and Dromm favor the passage of resolution 245. Sears responded, â€œIâ€™m here to tell you that Iâ€™m not sure where Iâ€™m on this. I havenâ€™t given it much consideration.â€<br /><br />A heated debated ensued over Searsâ€™ vote against the lead poisoning bill of 2004.<br /><br />â€œYes, I was one of the few who voted against and Iâ€™ll tell you the same thing I said then â€˜Itâ€™s absurd that Iâ€™d want lead in children,â€™â€ said Sears, who said the city has targeted areas where incidents of lead poisoning was high versus applying the law to the entire city. She instead favored a law that would ban the importing toys from countries with no lead bill. â€œThe fact is that it was a very bad bill.â€<br /><br />Dromm and Kalathara agreed that Sears had not done enough. â€œYou see, this is what politicians do, politics as usual. Just give an answer, did you support or not support,â€ said Kalathara. â€œI donâ€™t really think you focus on the community.â€<br /><br />After the forum, the feedback from the crowd was consistent.<br /><br />One 30-year resident of Jackson Heights, who did not want to give her name, said that Kalathara was funny and that despite voting for Sears in the past, this year sheâ€™ll vote for Dromm.<br /><br />Mary Jo Brookes, a resident of Jackson Heights for 19 years, thought the candidates did well. â€œThey gave good answers,â€ she said.<br /><br />Bing Wong, a resident of Elmhurst for 20 years, said that Kalatharaâ€™s statements would make people remember him. He then added more analysis on the forum.<br /><br />â€œHelen Sears did not do a good job,â€ Wong said. â€œBut the [Queens County Democratic] Party must support her. Sheâ€™s the incumbent.â€</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17799">After spending some time studying the videos and the information and insight provided, I have to say that I&#039;m a little concerned about the possibility of Helen Sears ending up in any elected office. <br /><br />Borough President?&nbsp; Yikes! Say it ain&#039;t so! <br /><br />Does she have the backing of the Democratic Party and if she cedes her campaign to Quiroz (as was suggested might happen) will he? That seems highly doubtful of course. Since I&#039;m only nominally a party member, and unaccustomed to party politics, I can only say that it seems like the Party would rather pick a winner than play loyalty games. <br /><br />I can&#039;t think of any elected position she would be good for, though I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll do fine as appointed to some position where she doesn&#039;t have to interact with the public or be held accountable to voters. <br /><br />However, some of the positions that she holds on resolutions regarding Patriot Act, Death Penalty, etc., seem not convictions on her part but rather opportunistic singalongs (note how she insists in the videos that she has never been &quot;for&quot; the death penalty). Since I was living in SoCal in 2000, I cannot account for what her position on term limits was then, or what has been before or since--until, that is, she lined up the Mayor. That action certainly turned me from a hand-sitter into something else (ahem) who will have a summer of unemployment to spend on a course of action...and when they did that (and when people like Monserrate sold out the small-businesses and workers at Willets Point) and with the deepening destruction and theft through eminent domain abuse, I woke from my slumber like an angry monster (albeit one named Cupcake).<br /><br />To pursue my point about her opportunism, my suspicion is only now trying to adjust her sails by &quot;meandering&quot; language that allows her some &quot;plausible deniability&quot; about things that yesterday were probably too hot to think clearly about. So much of post911 political rhetoric (and, sadly, legislative and judicial action) seems caught up in that. I think of the case of the treatment of Ward Churchill--until Stanley Fish&#039;s recent deconstruction of the Churchill affair (<a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/ward-churchill-redux/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/ward-churchill-redux/</a>) and also the discussion of domestic surveillance, torture, etc.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s rather difficult to know what someone thinks when they simply say what they think the prevailing views will hold on the matter. <br /><br />And the quote that the questioner, identified on this board as causidicus, read from the New York Times certainly referred to constituents, even granting (perhaps) that the reference was indirect, understood. She never did explain what (or to whom) she was referring in that quote, but my guess is that in the charged atmosphere of City Hall the sense of feeling embattled may read differently than it does from outside, and so the expectations of discourse within that environment would enable her to rat-out her angry peeps back home.&nbsp; She insinuates this often, not only in her attack on causidicus and some random points she made up and then attributed to him, but over and over:&nbsp; that electing someone into a secret society does not mean you have a right to oversee (or even know about, apparently) what is going on there. At the end of the embarrassing diatribe, she says that with the &quot;meandering&quot; and &quot;when the truth is twisted like a wet rag&quot; we are to &quot;expect a response.&quot; The irony of course is there for anyone to see, and if you study her language close enough you&#039;ll find more than a few self-incriminations like that. <br /><br />Another point in that brief video that I found terribly upsetting was her admission that while her office is open from 9-5, her staff was still there (it was at least 8:30 by that point) and that while they were only open during business hours often work overtime without pay. This public admission ought to be investigated, but my sense is that these staffers, like many public employees, keep long hours but are salaried with job descriptions to match. Still, she is the one who said they &quot;didn&#039;t take&quot; the overtime they are, apparently, owed. <br /><br />She meanders, too. Wow!&nbsp; Not a good public speaker. IF she&#039;s good at making the legislative sausage, or if she&#039;s bringin&#039; home the bacon, then I want to hear the inside skinny. What is she negotiating that she&#039;s too busy not to be accountable to her constituents? (That is, what is she giving up to get this co-called pork?) Her point might have been a good one: I&#039;m busy, I have people to help sort out input suggestions and inquiries from people in the district! But if her staff is not able to even sent out a letter of acknowledgment (as is typical in my experience, even when I&#039;ve written to representatives out of state) then we have a problem of organization. I can&#039;t get a response to a question--even a referral (most recently, I asked for information about how I might work locally on issue-X, looking for neighborhood leaders on issue-X) but other people are tying up her staff with requests that may not be served based on the merits. How do we even know? If she wants to do anything more than rep the 25th, she had better hire an image consultant and a speechwriter or handler. She was there, as far as I could tell, alone, but should have had someone giving her signals, especially since more than once she became a little unhinged. <br /><br />She is the one who should expect a response.<br /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17801">What we tend to forget is that the district doesn&#039;t begin on 69th Street and end at Junction Boulevard.&nbsp; It extends south through Elmhurst, Lefrak City and into Rego Park.&nbsp; Sears has always done well in the southern part of the district.&nbsp; CupcakeTownie, Sears may seem like a loser when it comes to Jackson Heights, but the County leadership will back her if they think she can hold her own here and win big in the densely populated parts of the southern end.&nbsp; I much prefer Dromm, although I have been critical of his decision to back Monserrate over Sabini, something Sears is guilty of too.&nbsp; But Dromm has to be careful not to fall into the trap other Jackson Heights candidates have fallen into.&nbsp; Just because you&#039;re popular on 77th Street doesn&#039;t mean you can compete in Lefrak City where hundreds of people have to just go downstairs to the building basement to vote.&nbsp; If Dromm runs, and I&#039;m not sure he will if County backs Sears, this will be a very tough race.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17806">Right-on analysis, Cupcake.&nbsp; Instead of implying that I was lying, why didn&#039;t Sears just address the issue?&nbsp; I obviously touched a nerve.<br /><br />As for other parts of the district, Queenskid, you are right that it will be a challenge for Dromm.&nbsp; However, I think Dromm can do the work to overcome any perceived obstacles.&nbsp; Knowledge is power, and I think Dromm&#039;s success depends on his ability to inform and connect with voters outside Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like Sears is any more responsive to Lefrak than to Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Dromm is completely serious about representing the 25th District.&nbsp; Compare his performance--substance, tone, energy--with the other candidates&#039; at the last two events.&nbsp; What you see Sears, Quiroz, and the County organization doing is a dance.&nbsp; Like all good dancers, they get so into what they are doing that they forget about the rest of the world, in this case, the residents of the community.&nbsp; There are many other perceptive posters who have caught on, so review previous posts if you want to see what I mean.<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17810">Queenskid, thanks for comments and insight, which are helpful for me as I am trying to figure all this out. In my day job I deal with people from different parts of the borough, so I realize that Jackson Heights is rather special and not because it&#039;s the next hot neighborhood for folks west of the East River or south of Newtown Creek. I know only a little about Tony Avella, but what I do know about him, and what I know about parts of his district, including Bayside, Whitestone, etc., make me wonder how he ever got elected. I guess when I imagine the work ahead this summer I&#039;m thinking of these areas like Lefrak City. (How are the elevators there, folks? Perhaps we should check that place out some hot summer night...I used to know someone who worked in the city building there and she said the elevators were frequently out. I&#039;d be interested to attend a larger 25th Dist meeting where issues there were discussed. I guess Daniel Dromm and all of the candidates have platforms that address the needs there and other parts of the dist. which are very different from JH. Lets hear about that. Seems to me that folks in JH are doing -- relatively, anyhow -- pretty well. I know, for example, that the library branch at Lefrak is in a basement which floods frequently, etc. Compare that to fancy new community centers and branch libraries. While obviously LIC/Queensbridge deserved theirs, and the Langston Hughes Community Center is one of the most amazing places in the borough--and the people there much deserve such resources--I can imagine that there are a laundry list of issues/concerns in places like Lefrak that I, at least, would do well to know more about.&nbsp; I never see anything about that place on more, um, conservative blogs like Queenscrap, but perhaps I&#039;m missing something there. Perhaps the next meeting some of these more particular issues -- such as the hospital closings which came up in the first meeting -- affecting Lefrak -- will come up and Dromm, Sears and the others will have the chance to be more specific...<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_17827">Having Ms. Sears on government payroll is a waste of precious taxpayer dollars.&nbsp; The tax free ad she sent to the entire district was another waste (those state of the district campaign letters should be outlawed no matter who is in office).&nbsp; That newsletter was all fluff.&nbsp; &nbsp;I especially chuckled when she was responsible for safer streets (yeah in the last year there have been significant crimes on Roosevelt Ave).<br /><br />Graffiti is such that it almost rivals the 1970s (or least on its way there).&nbsp; There are more empty stores than in the previous five years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The MTA&#039;s new subway at Roosevelt still looks like a hellhole if you look at the corner of Roosevelt and 75th St.&nbsp; Why is the MTA allowed to have that corner boarded up for the last four years?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It would better to have a vacant seat for the next four years than for her reelection.&nbsp; </div>
