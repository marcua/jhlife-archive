				Orange cat spotted on 84th bet 35/37th ave. He/she was super friendly coming right up to us. I was tempted to run in ctown to get some cat food but was in a hurry with my child (I now feel guilty) I dont live over that way. It had what appeared to be dried blood near its eyes. Is someone missing him/her? it seemed way too friendly to be an alley cat. Even if you can&#039;t take it maybe someone can bring it some food?? It was on the east side near to where the barber shop use to be.

				Bellabella,<br /><br />I saw that cat cross 84th St. near 37th Ave. when I came home tonight.&nbsp; I thought it was a feral orange cat that has been around for a while.&nbsp; I asked my neighbor Ellen because she knows all the neighborhood cats and has a friend who sometimes rescues cats from our area.&nbsp; She and her friend have been seeing the friendly orange cat for many months now and they both came to the conclusion that someone owns that cat and lets it outside.&nbsp; They said it always seems well fed and in pretty good shape.<br /><br />I actually hope someone nice takes the cat in because it&#039;s irresponsible to allow a cat outside in thie neighborhood, especially because he&#039;s friendly and crosses in front of cars.&nbsp;

				thanks for the replies he/she did look well fed but Im going to bring it some food after church today!! Hopefully the owner will think twice about letting it out. Maybe get a leash and walk it? I can see this poor thing going up to an evil person and them doing something bad or an aggressive dog getting hold of it!

				That description of the cat sounds just like the one that I see on 77th St, between Broadway and Woodside Ave.<br />I highly doubt that it&#039;s the same cat though.
