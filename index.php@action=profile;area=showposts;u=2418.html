Here&#039;s a website that says crew members make good money for a retail/grocery job, they get regular job reviews and raises, that they are generally treated well by management, they have access to health care benefits, etc:<br /><a href="http://www.jobitorial.com/trader-joes-job-reviews-C814" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jobitorial.com/trader-joes-job-reviews-C814</a><br /><br />That is just one link of many I found, Googling &quot;how much does Trader Joes pay&quot;.<br /><br />In contrast to the &quot;big boys&quot; I believe most Key Foods and Associated markets are privately owned, and they pay much less than what Trader Joes pays...<br /><br />So how about backing up some of your claims.&nbsp; &quot;multi-Trillion dollar company&quot; who &quot;spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employer&quot;. Really? <br /><br /><br />Sure lets compare companies that are in similar brackets, like sales, profits, and labor. Stop &amp; Shop full time employees start at 11.25 per hour have full medical insurance paid by the company, full pension benifits paid for by the company, time and a half on sundays, paid holidays, sick time, personal time, and vacation. Guarenteed raises twice a year (on specfic dates so everyone knows when the raises will be), without an arbitary review by someone that may or may not like you. Oh did I mention guareentee 40 hrs per week, regardless of the sales. <br /><br />It is not &quot;sour grapes&quot; . It is called a fundemental believe in my brother and sisteers not being trampled by coporations. I take great pride in making sure my disposable income is spent in places that recognize humans as, well as humans, and not overhead. <br /><br />Do you take time out to make sure you buy fair trade coffee or not to buy blood diamonds? If yes, then take a moment to realize in your backyard people are living in wage slave system that is designed to keep them down. This is not a fantasy. The world is full of reports and non fiction studies of this system. Who coined the phrase &quot;crew members make good money for retail/grocery jobs&quot; What type of elitism is that? Shame on you for judging a man or woman because of the job they have. Maybe we were not all born in the 1% and we must fight for better wages.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yours Truly<br />99% <br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					The point of the first link was to illustrate that Trader Joe&#039;s does nothing to better the world, unless they are forced to. An illustrated example would be the Imokalee Workers who fought for years to get TJ to pay a penny more per pound on tomatoes to lift the wages of the pickers. Again, only because of immense pressure, not because they are a &quot;good&quot; company did they finally cave.<br /><br />Trader Joe workers are nnot compensated well for their hard work. Trader Joe&#039;s has spent billions of dollars promoting itself as a good employeer, but just like Fox News&#039; attempt at a similar PR, most of us have the ability to see through the campaign. <br /><br />Reason TJ has low prices? same as why Wal-Mart has low prices. They pressure the supliers to agree to artificialy low prices. <br /><br />I for one, will not stand by while people beg a multi-trillion dollar company to do business in my neighborhood. <br /><br />And remember K2000, if the &quot;big boys&quot;, Trader Joe&#039;s, Wal-Mart, Wholefoods, et.al. can get away with being terrible employeers, neighbors, and citizens, then the little guys will as well.&nbsp;

					So it seems that people are incapable of having an intelligent and thoughtful discourse. Again, I wonder way taggie is attacking Ms. Ramos for simply posting a relevant news article. These personal attacks by marlene and taggie remind me of the juvenile attacks tea-baggers, conservatives, and republicans use to turn debate away from in depth discussion.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am saddened that some people let a conversation about how to keep open spaces in JH turn into this shallow attack. <br /><br />If you continue in this direction this is what we have to look forward to: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=floM6Idv94c&amp;feature=related" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=floM6Idv94c&amp;feature=related</a><br /><br />Enjoy!

					Marlene what does ms. Ramos&#039;s former employment have to do with the GS and the possible sale of the land. The discussion is about the HeadMaster is in the exact same position he was in 20 years ago and the community should be on their toes. <br /><br />An earlier post was deleted from you because of content, it appears you have not learned from your mistake. Stop airing your personal issues with people on this discussion. All you are doing, is lowering the level of conversation. <br /><br />Please keep your comments to the content, not the person.

It is now 2011. Why are you doing this? We are nice people at Garden school who are just trying to give their children the best education that can. Please stop spreading the rumor that the school is closing based on your opinion. Please be nice, there are children involved here, innocent children who love their school. You are creating panic for no reason.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t understand how anyone is being vilified. I find information very productive. And if I&#039;m going to lend the school money (which I cannot afford to do, but the purpose of keeping open land out of the hands of developers is so important, I mean this goes way beyond us today. It will have an impact for hundreds of years) I would like as much info as I can get. I think it is relevant, its called a pattern of behavior, humans are repetitive creatures, and what we do in the past, we often do in the future. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not sure how many kids are reading JH life considering at the emergency community meeting by the GS own count only 9% of kids (about 25) are from JH (great clip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo</a>). <br /><br />Toddg, if we get through this crisis and they turn around and sell the school next year to a developer, what then? The purchase of the school yard would be a waste of money.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid of information, be afraid of developers!<br /><br /><br />

					This really is a shame. Personally where is Assemblyman Dendeker? This is the second beating that took place within two weeks in his district. The first was on 91st and 37th. I am outraged that this do-nothing politician can&#039;t stand up. Is it because it was 2 Latinos that got beat? What if it was a one of the more wealthy neighbors we have? I know the new Assemblyman took some heat for not having candy on Halloween, but this is serious. Dendeker come out and stand up for justice, you can&#039;t hide behind the Sear&#039;s machine forever!
