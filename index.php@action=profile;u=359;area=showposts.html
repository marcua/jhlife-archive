					One of the benefits of posting the perpetrator&#039;s photograph in our vestibule, alongside a brief description of the recent event, is that tenants can point them out to anyone trying to enter without their own key while the door&#039;s open and say, &quot;Sorry, but we&#039;re being extra vigilant here these days.&quot; It does appear to help in this regard. Other buildings might simply post a brief summary of our misfortune for the same purpose.

					The remarks made here are not meant in any way to minimize the latest incident in the building on 75th St. (or violence against women in general), to excuse such behavior in any way, or to question how serious and frightening it was for the woman who was targeted. This is simply an effort to supply more information about what is known about the incident. I am a tenant in said building. I did not personally witness any of the following, but have spoken to various tenants who were involved.<br /><br />The individual who was arrested entered the building around 7 or so in the evening, apparently by waiting for someone to unlock the front door and then following in after them (our building has 100+ units and quite a lot of in-out traffic at this time of day). At some point a little later he entered the elevator, where a tenant, by herself, was going up to her floor. He remarked that she had very pretty feet. Taken aback, she simply said thank you and ignored him. He then asked if he could kiss them (her feet), but at this moment the door opened at her floor and she passed him and got out. As she headed away from the elevator she turned around to glance back and saw him exposing himself. She began to scream and ran toward her apartment. Hearing her screams, almost immediately several tenants came out into the halls, on her floor and others. A chase ensued down the stairs and several residents cornered and held the intruder in the lobby. Someone called 911 to report the incident and call for assistance. It apparently took 25-30 minutes for the police from 115 to respond.<br /><br />Several details: <br /><br />--the perpetrator appears to be Hispanic, probably in his 20s. <br />--he has been arrested before for exposing himself to women and I&#039;ve been told that he is registered as a sexual offender.<br />--he has not served time previously for offenses, but is now, with this latest offense, being held until a trial date sometime in October. This latest incident apparently violates conditions allowing him to avoid jail time previously, so there appears a better chance that he will now be given time.<br />--neither in this latest incident nor in early ones involving this individual was there any physical contact or &quot;assault&quot;--as far as I&#039;ve been able to ascertain (other than the obviously serious emotional/psychological assault). As I said, this is in no way meant to minimize the seriousness of this behavior!<br /><br />In general and perhaps more helpfully:<br /><br />This is the <span class="bbc_u">second</span> time this individual was behaving like this in our building. In the first instance (at least that we&#039;re aware of), 5 or 6 weeks ago, the super happened to pass him in the basement and, not recognizing him, asked him what he was doing. (Our building has outside entrances into the basement, so people are frequently passing through this level.) The young man left the building at that point, so the super went to our video security cameras and discovered that he had been hanging around the basement for half an hour or so, watching when women came down to enter the laundry room. This was approximately 6 PM in the evening, with a lot of activity in the building, in general. During this period he exposed himself several times without any of the women being aware of it (to the best of my knowledge). (They were in the laundry room, he was in the hallway outside, peering around the doorframe at them). At one point he waited out of sight until a young woman left the laundry and got in the elevator, then tried to run to the elevator and get in with her. Fortunately, the elevator door had already closed. A few minutes later the super encountered him and he left the building.<br /><br />In this previous case we were able to find video of him entering the main lobby door when someone from the building was leaving. We posted pictures of him (very sharp, easily identifiable images) in several locations besides the lobby, together with an alert to tenants to call 911 if he was seen. We also stressed the need to not let anyone enter the building that the tenant does not know. We left these photos and warnings up for a week. Subsequent to this latest incident we have again posted the photograph and the warnings and plea for tenant vigilance--along with a thank you to the many people who responded so quickly and effectively!<br /><br />The video camera system has been very helpful in this situation, allowing the latest incident to be taken in the context of a prior one, which may well make the difference in this man having to serve time and/or get additional help. The bottom line continues to be tenant awareness of those coming in and out of the building and being willing to &quot;be rude&quot; and not let people enter on the heels of someone else. A building&#039;s security measures are ultimately only as effective as the residents make them.<br />

					I&#039;ve been going to the BQE for more than two years now, since moving to JH from Manhattan (where I belonged to an NYSC by NYU for many years), and my experience has been quite good (compared to the moderator of this thread, who snidely trashed the place back in February--he&#039;d obviously not been there in a while). Compared to how dingy and disorganized it was when I first joined, the place is now spacious and relatively well layed out (it&#039;s apparently grown by additions over the years), and the aerobic equipment and much of the free weights are new and plentiful. Complaints regarding cleanliness must have registered, because a cleaning crew is constantly mopping and wiping down equipment. The men&#039;s locker room, at least, is also recently renovated, with sauna and steam. There is no pool, but there are handball courts. There&#039;s also an area with punching bags for boxing and kick-boxing. The place is open 24 hours, as far as I know, and has aerobic and spinning classes, although I&#039;ve never attended. I try to go midday, when there aren&#039;t so many people around. Late afternoons, of course, can be very busy. While the gym has a very diverse clientele, in keeping with the surrounding neighborhoods, it&#039;s predominantly Hispanic (at least midday). It&#039;s also diverse very diverse with regard to age, gender, sexual orientation, fitness level, etc. etc.. I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s popular with NYC cops; there was an article in the NYT four or five years ago that described it as popular with cabbies, who liked it&#039;s proximity to the BQE expressway and came in the wee hours to work out. There are stairs between three floors--no elevators--in case this is an issue for you.<br /><br />Regarding cost, the BQE is apparently much cheaper than a lot of places mentioned here. I rejoined before the renovation was complete and paid around $400 for 2 years if I recall. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s more now. As for location, I live on 75th and travel to and from the gym by bike. The distance is perfect for bike, but too far for walking, and it&#039;s not near any train or bus.&nbsp; Of course if you drive it&#039;s no problem, they have a small lot and I observe most people parking on the street. <br /><br />The BQE works great for me and I think it&#039;s definitely worth checking out (in contrast to others who were commenting here last winter), but I hope a lot more people don&#039;t join!<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.bqefitnesscenter.net/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bqefitnesscenter.net/</a>

					Buddy--I think taking hungry or otherwise needy strays under your wing (speaking of animals) as you describe--in your apartment--is entirely admirable. My concern is with putting food outside willy-nilly, potentially creating more problems with rodents. <br /><br />I&#039;m also curious now if the neighborhood seeder is just one person. I&#039;ve been told by others that she&#039;s regularly seen throughout the neighborhood. A passerby who lives in her building and knows her slightly told us she puts out 30-40 lbs of birdseed a day! That sounds a bit hard to believe, but you never know. The cart she pushes would handle it, and it might also explain why she was wearing a support belt for her back--like weightlifters use.

					After hearing about her for a long time, another resident and I who work in the gardens of our building on 75th finally saw the &quot;pigeon lady&quot; a few weeks ago throwing birdseed among the plants. We politely told her we respected her love of animals but would really appreciate it if she would stop throwing bread and seeds into our gardens. She said she never spread anything other than birdseed. We pointed out that uneaten seeds mean more weeding for us. She said she&#039;d stop, and I think she has (in our gardens). <br /><br />We&#039;ve also got residents who daily put out food and water for stray cats, which I would think would attract vermin. But rational discussion of the issue doesn&#039;t deter them.

They did a really fine job, which included plaster skim coats on the walls before painting. They&#039;re especially detail oriented and careful--contrasting wood trim was perfect. The building I live in is from the 1930s, but the walls looked like new afterwards. A year or so later a friend of mine moved into Dunnolly Gardens and used them. She was also very happy with their work. Now a third acquaintance of mine is using them for a total redo of her apartment in the Andrew Jackson. In this case we discovered that Robert has a lot of skill in helping choose color schemes. He&#039;s got guys who can do just about anything. In this Andrew Jackson job he realigned (squared) existing kitchen cabinets, replaced the doors, repainted the frames, made alterations to closet walls, created an opening between kitchen and living room, is putting in new tile in the kitchen, etc. A sub-crew of his refinished my floors and is doing the floors here as well. He&#039;s just very good and very responsible. His prices are reasonable. I&#039;m including some pics of my finished apartment as well as the job he&#039;s currently doing.
