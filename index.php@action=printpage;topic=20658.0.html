				With back-to-school less than two weeks away, let&#039;s start a conversation on Covid prevention measures in Jackson Heights schools. Prinicipals had very little guidance until mid-August on core issues like testing and quarantine protocols. <br />Have you heard from your child&#039;s school about its Covid prevention plan? If so, what do you think of it? Any creative solutions to thorny issues (spacing, lunch and snack time, ventilation) that go above and beyond what the DOE is offering?

				For PS 69 families and other concerned community members: here is a petition to create an outdoor eating option at the school. Many public health leaders have identified indoor eating as one of the riskiest times for unvaccinated children. <br /><br />https://www.change.org/ps69outdoors

Hopefully more persuasive than having one person request it.
