				This is such a great resource for JH residents and future JH residents. I will be looking at two apartments this Sunday, one in the Saybrook and one in Colonial Courts. Any thoughts on those as well?<br />Thanks!

				My husband and I really liked the Saybrook and went to contract on an apartment there... until the seller backed out at the last minute without reason.&nbsp; The apartments are spacious, and the building well-kept.&nbsp; We really liked the super and the garden.&nbsp; I love my apartment now, but I still walk by there and wonder what if...

				I know buildings better by Avenue and which streets they&#039;re between than by their formal names, but I think the Saybrook is near me: 34th Ave. bet. 86/85 Streets??&nbsp; Lovely building.&nbsp; Well kept.&nbsp; I know they used to have a terrific Super (don&#039;t know if he&#039;s still there).<br /><br />Don&#039;t know where the other building is so can&#039;t say much.&nbsp; One bit of advice: apartments with bedrooms overlooking the Avenues are more noisy than bedrooms in the back of the buildings especially when weather is warm and windows are open.&nbsp; Something to consider.

				I live in the sister building to the Saybrook, The Griswold.&nbsp; I have to say that I do think 34th Avenue one of the most beautiful streets in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The planted medians, bike lanes and historic buildings really give it a mini-Park Avenue feel.&nbsp; In addition, no buses.&nbsp; If you get an apartment in the back of the building you should have a nice unobstructed view over the garden homes depending which floor you are on.&nbsp; My friend&#039;s parents live in the Saybrook and they seem happy.&nbsp; They have been there for 20+ years.&nbsp; Also, there are a few garages nearby and parking is much easier than in the 70s.&nbsp; Con is you are a little further from the express trains.&nbsp; However, there is a bus one block away on 35th Ave. which runs every 10 minutes during rush hour and takes you right to the express train station.&nbsp; Happy Hunting.&nbsp; How exciting.
