				the south Asian vegetarian place that replaced Himalayan hut has opened. just stopped in for a snack -- hoping to get the GF out in a day or two for a full meal -- but the idly and chat was very tasty, spicy as requested and the management could not be nicer. they also have more veggie curries and non-south Asian options than dosa delight or other local pure veggie places. i&#039;m on their team already.

				I can totally understand the knee jerk objection , even though some of the best food I&#039;ve had in recent years has been in subdivided places - a Persian stand inside a blah Chelsea pizza joint, the chat outside the ready penny on73rd. If its not egregiously ugly I don&#039;t see why people are getting panties in a bunch.<br /><br />Lifer, you know details better then I.... Is this illegal as you said, or just unpalatable to those with certain aesthetics ?

				Had a very fine meal last night at this new veggie Indian place on 37th around 76th next to Dunkin&#039; Donuts. Very fresh food nicely presented by friendly staff. Sparse customer base perhaps due to cold but they seemed to be getting some takeout orders. Prices are more than fair and I highly recommend even if you&#039;re not a vegetarian. Never had lentil donuts before and found them delish with the coconut sauce spooned on top...just one of many appealing prospects on the long menu....

				Was there last night and as far as I can see they are referring only to a very small area in the front, nothing that would require subdivision or whatnot. There are a couple of bakery cases already in place from which a vendor could sell Indian snacks or kulfis or something. This is a place that deserves support. My take....

				I&#039;ve been to Samudra a few times over the past couple weeks, and even ordered delivery from them. I ended up here because I was trying to order takeout from Arunee and they told me the wait time was 45 minutes (on a Wednesday night!).&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this is a really great addition to the area, and I can&#039;t believe that they&#039;re not getting more foot traffic.&nbsp; The food has been consistently good, the servers consistently friendly and helpful.&nbsp; I even got a free dessert to try the last time I was there.

				Was looking for a Vegetarian restaurant in the neighborhood other than Dosa Delight.&nbsp; And I know all the Indian restaurants serve vegetarian dishes but I wanted to try someplace new.&nbsp; Ended up here for lunch today.&nbsp; Before ordering I read reviews on yelp so decided to have a Dosa.&nbsp; On yelp someone had a mix of spinach and potatoes which wasn&#039;t on the menu so I asked and they graciously accommodated me.&nbsp; It&#039;s the first time I had a Dosa that wasn&#039;t already filled when brought to the table (like the buffet at the Jackson Diner) and I was so happy.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always hated this big shell with stuffing only in the middle.&nbsp; It was light and crisp; I liked tearing it apart and spooning on my filling and sampling first the orange sauce -- never saw or had before --and it was mildly spicy and delicious.&nbsp; Next I sampled the coconut sauce (maybe what they called coconut chutney?).&nbsp; I LOVE coconut flavor so this was also wonderful.&nbsp; The sambar tasted like a light tomato broth lentil vegetable soup.&nbsp; I liked it a lot.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t expect to get full since there wasn&#039;t rice with the Dosa but after I ate EVERYTHING I was perfectly full.&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to go back and try a other dishes.&nbsp; The interior was clean, bland but pleasant.&nbsp; The front cases that JHlifer mentioned were empty and looked like they would be for desserts.&nbsp; It certainly wouldn&#039;t bother me at all if they had a vendor selling their desserts as a compliment to the restaurants food but honestly, since they were empty I have no idea what the deal is there.&nbsp; eddiestjohns I was surprised to see you didn&#039;t like the idea since it&#039;s not like the restaurant was divided into different establishments.&nbsp; The rents are so high in JHs if this helps a vegetarian restaurant stay in business I AM ALL FOR IT!&nbsp; &nbsp;(the photo looks like a potato dosa)

				<br />This is the best Indian food I have ever eaten in Jackson Heights. I recently brought a vegetarian friend of mine here on a bitter cold day and she was extremely happy with the food, and she&#039;s a picky eater. I have been here several times and also appreciate the fact that not everything is super spicy, and they respect the fact that some people prefer average/mild spices.<br />I recently ordered the potatoe dosa, it was delicious, it was my actually my first dosa.

				I stopped in after work this week for a to-go order, and really liked the food.&nbsp; What was even nicer was that while I was waiting, the owner invited me to sit down in back (rather than stand up front), and was so super nice when I asked him a bunch of questions about what was on the menu. Even after my order came out, he told me to wait a minute, and brought out a small dessert for me (i&#039;m not sure what it was, but it was delicious, like rice pudding but more watery, with hints of cinnamon and crushed pistachios on top).&nbsp; I actually told him I saw his restaurant on this forum, and he had me show him the website on his ipad :) .&nbsp; Great experience, will definitely go back in the near future.&nbsp; As mentioned, interior is not modern, just run-of-the-mill, but its not a hole in the wall either, so it would be comfortable to dine-in.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I finally went here with a friend over the weekend. I had the Mysore Rava Masala Dosa, which was really different than other dosas I have had in the past. The wrap itself had a reddish coloring and was a bit spicy in addition to the filling and was delicious. My friend had the Mushroom Uthappam, which she did not think she would finish, but ended up leaving very little on her plate. I&#039;ll definitely be back again soon.<br /><br />My order did take a little long, but it was worth it in the end.

				I&#039;ve been many times, consistently excellent and extremely affordable. Service is earnest but sometimes spotty (they forget a dish, or bring the wrong one). Even this is better lately. Some of the best palak paneer and aloo gobi I&#039;ve ever had.

				i love the Mysore Masala Dosa, but it is spicy if that&#039;s a concern. the Onion Dosa is really good if you prefer something mild. both are quite large and come with sambar/chutney.<br /><br />the paneer entrees are great, but rich. and my personal favorite - an acquired taste, i&#039;ve been told -- is the Halwa Puri. a dish of sweet pudding, a dish of spicy chickpeas and two puri. it&#039;s a breakfast dish in South India, i believe, but i can eat it any time.

				So we ordered dinner at Samudra last night. As always, so good!! In the past I was hooked on their channa bhatura. It is this super delicious, spicy chickpea dish served over this puffy fried bread. (I always add a side order of coconut chutney ($1) to take the heat down to my preferred taste.) <br /><br />Last night I wanted to try a few new dishes with rice, fearing the fried bread might be too heavy. We chose Aloo Palak, Channa Phishori, Spinach Masala Dosa. It was a lot of food for two people, but we wanted leftovers for lunch. <br /><br />The channa and the dosa were the stars of the show. The chickpeas had mild spice and were flavorful. I added a little of the enclosed yoghurt sauce which was a nice addition. I did enjoy the Aloo Palak too which for my tastes benefitted from adding a little of the enclosed (red) hot sauce and a touch of salt. (They also included some pickled hot mango on the side as well.)<br /><br />This dosa knocked my socks off. In this version the crepe was made with rice and lentil flour and filled with spinach and potato masala. It absolutely sings with a douse of coconut chutney (which comes on the side with it) and a dash of salt. Delicious and filling. <br /><br />Besides increasing our order frequency, we wonder if there is any other way we can help Samudra stay in business? Maybe a go fund me or other way to donate is out there? Please let us know. They are a true gem in this neighborhood! <br />

				They could be creative. Maybe screen BOLLYWOOD movies by their outside dining area. <br /><br />That&#039;ll help them stand out.<br /><br />Laly&#039;s, for instance, appears to have created a night club vibe with loud Latinx club music.<br />And they seem to be always busy now.

I did enjoy the Aloo Palak too which for my tastes benefitted from adding a little of the enclosed (red) hot sauce and a touch of salt. (They also included some pickled hot mango on the side as well.)<br /><br />This dosa knocked my socks off. In this version the crepe was made with rice and lentil flour and filled with spinach and potato masala. It absolutely sings with a douse of coconut chutney (which comes on the side with it) and a dash of salt. Delicious and filling. <br /><br />Besides increasing our order frequency, we wonder if there is any other way we can help Samudra stay in business? Maybe a go fund me or other way to donate is out there? Please let us know. They are a true gem in this neighborhood!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A gofundme might work but it would have to be creative. Maybe raise money where half goes to the restaurant for operating expenses and the other half to purchase a meal for first responders or hospital staff. So if someone donates $20, then $10 goes to the restaurant to keep them afloat, and $10 goes to buy Samudra food to donate to some sort of group event.

				The solutions are staring them in the face.<br /><br />Arepa Lady, Arunee (and everyone in Astoria) have taken over the street for extra outdoor space... where Samudra might screen Bollywood films.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t take an Einstein to steal that idea of using the street.<br /><br />It takes creativity.<br /><br />

				it will take more than creativity to screen a film in a space that limited. they can&#039;t take the whole sidewalk...there needs to be a space to walk. and people will have to walk between the diners/viewers and the screen/monitor the whole time. spatial realities have to be considered. <br /><br />it&#039;s a narrow storefront. they only have room for four seats now. they could boost that to eight if they take a parking lane, but then where does the screen go.<br /><br />physical reality, not out of the box thoughts. i&#039;m not being confrontational here. would really like to hear your concrete answer.

				when you float theories, expect to be challenged. if you can&#039;t rise to meet a challenge, you&#039;ve shown the theory to be invalid. <br /><br />when your theories generate success, you will be rewarded with silence.

				Thanks everyone for the menu suggestions!<br /><br />Our favorites so far are the dosas, the malai kofta, and the Bombay burger. I hope they can stay in business.

				I haven&#039;t yet eaten in one of these outdoor situations yet. I&#039;d be curious to hear about people&#039;s dining experiences on 37th Ave in particular. If Samudra is in arrears to their landlord, it might be hard to pay the startup costs involved in building a compliant dining structure for the street. I have heard many people say they just aren&#039;t ready yet, even for the outdoor dining experience.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />And since there&#039;s been a lot of back and forth, I have a suggestion for this visual appeal idea: Samudra could place a translucent surface (like a sheer white curtain or vellum) inside their windows, projecting the image through this and out through the glass storefront. It would look cool, but considering how late it gets dark now, it might not be effective for many of their open hours.&nbsp;
