As to the other point: &quot;What&#039;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot; That is, it is perfectly fair to object to a building&#039;s qualities or occupants. But to object to its name? I&#039;m not so sure how big of an issue that is. Would I have named the building that? Most likely not. Does it matter, all things considered? Not in the slightest. Were some clandestine cabal from China buying out and renaming The Chateau, The Belvedere, and the Greystones, we might have a discussion. Otherwise, I see no reason for this thread, sorry. I agree with sl on this one.

				The developers are probably marketing the units to the Flushing overflow.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care&nbsp; who they rent to but we are already overdeveloped/congested beyond the max here.&nbsp; 37th Ave &amp; 82nd St. and Roosevelt Ave&nbsp; are some of the most congested streets I&#039;ve been on in the city.&nbsp; We need more open public space not more apartments.&nbsp;

				No one is going to develope JH unless they can make some money doing it. I&#039;m just grateful that the building is relatively attractive and that the Health Store will be moving to a large commerical space in the base of the building.<br />This (potentially) could be a good thing.

				The main reason this building looks contextual is because it is in the Jackson Heights Historic District.&nbsp; It also helped that a number of people, including myself, testifed at the Landmarks Preservation Commission&#039;s public hearings three or so years ago.&nbsp; For example, had it not been for our commentary, the east-facing facade would have had a wall of brick without one window.&nbsp; Other aesthetic improvements were also the result of community input.<br /><br />According to the final plan, there will be a small garden, of similar depth to the adjacent residential building, on the 84 street elevation... although it will be interrupted by the entrance to the building itself and to the garage.<br /><br />Again, my advice is get involved and not simply react.&nbsp; If you want something better for your community, you have to stick your neck out and have your voice heard when it matters.

				I sent some details on this building over to Brownstoner Queens in hopes of getting some more information on this building:<br /><br /><strong>New Jackson Heights Building Nears Completion</strong><br />http://queens.brownstoner.com/2013/05/new-jackson-heights-building-nears-completion/ (http://queens.brownstoner.com/2013/05/new-jackson-heights-building-nears-completion/)<br /><br />The signage above the entrance looks more like it says Yin C Hu Tower to me, but I do think Vin Chu has a nicer ring to it. It may just be a case of too much spacing between some of the characters. It&#039;s also hard to tell if the first letter is a Y or a V. As was said before, if the apartments are nice, then who cares what the name is.<br /><br />(https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8sKTlMN-2bE/Uaa-7hX_lYI/AAAAAAAAAs8/m-eYUM14PA8/w430-h762-no/IMAG0267.jpg)

				Much ado made about nothing imho - the building is really not that bad and you can hardly see the name even if it&#039;s odd.&nbsp; I do think the distaste is slightly xenophobic as well, would anyone care if they named it the John Caldwell building or something similarly random only WASPY?&nbsp; That is the one thing we do have over other neighborhoods - I mean look at Astoria. Without JH&#039;s benefit of having historic designation and dedicated old-timers who want to make a fuss, my poor old hood is positively bursting with chrome-fenced, pink-bricked, ionic columned multi-family abominations.

				I think it is normal for people to wonder and be concerned about a new development in their neighborhood. and I don&#039;t think anyone has been overly dramatic, racist or otherwise. I think people are curious and concerned because this is potentially a major development on 37th Avenue.<br /><br />I did bring up the issue of Chinese investment because a real estate friend told me that a lot of people are investing in apartments with money from China, and they are paying cash. A pure practical fact that impacts home prices and other issues relating to life in JH.

				I saw a truck from a Chinese cabinet factory supplier in front this past weekend. The poster on the side boasted &quot;Ten year warranty&quot;. Ikea cabinets have a 25 year warranty. If I payed $440, 000 for a small 800 sq. ft. unit, I would want cabinets from better supplier with a much better warranty. 800 square feet is small for this neighborhood and 44000 is expensive for even a two bedroom condo.

				It sounds like they may be starting to show apartments in this building:<br /><br /><strong>Is the Vin C Hu Tower Open for Showings?<br /></strong><br /><em>Word from a tipster is that brokers started showing apartments this past weekend at the new Jackson Heights condo, on 37th Avenue and 84th Street, and that an official open house is scheduled for this weekend. Last we heard on Jackson Heights Life, the development (oddly named the ‘Vin C Hu Tower’) holds 45 condo units and three commercial spaces. This development replaced a one-story retail building that burned down in 2010. Currently, it looks like listings, photos, or pricing do not exist on the internet. Did anybody check out this building over the weekend? If you’re able to file a report on the interiors and the pricing, hit up our tipline please!</em> <br /><br />http://queens.brownstoner.com/2014/01/is-the-vin-c-hu-tower-open-for-showings/?ic_source=ic-featured-frontpage-top (http://queens.brownstoner.com/2014/01/is-the-vin-c-hu-tower-open-for-showings/?ic_source=ic-featured-frontpage-top)

				I have the offering sheet. Cheapest unit is $344k for 1br/1bath (564 sf) all the way up a 2br/3bath (which struck me as odd) at 1556 sf that&#039;s asking a cool $1.09 mil. That&#039;s the aberration though... there are 3br/2bath units just under 1000 sf that are asking around 600k. Still, throw in taxes, common and carrying charges and it&#039;s fairly pricy.

				<br />With prices like that, it may end up to be like that big condo facing Roosevelt Train Sta off of Broadway, which was not a success story.... I believe also Chinese.

				If these prices are correct I can&#039;t, for the life of me, figure out who would pay these prices for an apartment in this aesthetically challenged building.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s not ugly but a cookie cutter of others on the avenue and pretty bland.&nbsp; (The probably bought the plans at a Walmart.)&nbsp; If you have this kind of money you could get something much nicer in this neighborhood.&nbsp; My theory is they will probably be bought by large, extended families or, perhaps, two families might live in one apartment.&nbsp; Or it could be people who will buy the apartments and rent them out.&nbsp; It&#039;s a condo so they probably can do that.&nbsp; But maybe I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be interesting to see what happens.&nbsp; It may be a glimpse into where the neighborhood might be headed.&nbsp;

				I for one am not crazy about the building being a condo. It suggest that investors can come in, buy an apartment and then rent it out to whomever. I would hope that the people who buy there care for the neighborhood. Coop owners and homeowners generally have a more vested interest in the neighborhood. Although&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any of the apartments, the square footage and pricing suggest that you can get something much nicer and with more character in a pre-war just around the corner.

				agree with all of francis and jack&#039;s comments. thankfully, there&#039;s not a lot of room for &#039;investors&#039; to tinker in the area, other than buying up a block of 37th or (far less likely) northern to raze retail for similar cookie cutter places.

I look at the layout of our apt and I can&#039;t fathom how 3br and 2ba fit into 1000sqft comfortably without being extremely tiny. And around 600K for tiny bedrooms? No thanks... I suppose it probably has a doorman and some other amenities? I would imagine W/D in unit (which we don&#039;t have...) but still.. add space for in-unit W/D and 1000 sqft for 3/2 seems even LESS appealing.. where&#039;s the closet space?

				I hope it doesn&#039;t involve investors who realize after the fact that they got scammed, and the only way to recoup their investment is to rent out each apartment at such an exorbitant amount that 20 people would have to share the apartment in order to afford the rent.<br /><br />I do hope there is some entity that will check to make sure the occupants in these condos are not exceeding occupancy limits.

				It&#039;s not just the extra cars or even foot traffic, although that&#039;s part of it. It&#039;s the usage of infrastructure and resources. The fact that parking isn&#039;t included doesn&#039;t stop people from buying cars if they feel that they need one. They just buy a car and hope that it works out (e.g. Park Slope- every so often they talk about doing residential parking permits to overcome the parking shortage, but mostly people just scream about the lack of parking). Hopefully the extension of the 7 will help with subway crowding, but you never know. My biggest issue is garbage. More people in an area always means more garbage. Hopefully it will be properly disposed of and not end up as litter or more dog poop on the streets. <br /><br />Maybe none of this will be a problem with the addition of just one building. But if we start having multiple new buildings in the area, these issues could be real.

Of course, these investors will have to pay property tax, which is very low.

				in October, we moved a block away from the Yin Hu and during our evening strolls to get pastels or make groceries, we look to try and see which units are occupied.&nbsp; The 5th and 6th floor rentals seem to be alot more lit up than the sales floors below.&nbsp; Anyone know anything about it?

				I&#039;m one of the unfortunates who lives in this apartment building. I&#039;ll be the first to admit I moved here without checking everything over but did so because my lease was about to expire and I was in dire need of a new home. Let me tell you, all your complaints about this place are valid. As I type this, I can hear my neighbors talking next door. The walls are paper thin, so much so that I can also hear people down the hall speaking from inside their apartments. My bathroom only has 2 lights and I can&#039;t use a shower curtain because it blocks out the light. The floors are nice and shiny but cheap and already cracking. The rooms are SMALL. SO SMALL. And rent is expensive. Please, avoid this place. The owners are money-hungry and eager to get people in but it is not worth the trouble you&#039;ll go through once you move in.
