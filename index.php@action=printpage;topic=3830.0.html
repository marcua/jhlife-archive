				I decided to post this in a different thread because I&#039;ve found a lot of conflicting info on this specific subject alone.&nbsp; To the people that have had their bathrooms remodeled... how difficult was the floor to do?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the normal small pink and blue tiles and the grout around them is crumbling and the tiles are loose.&nbsp; Last night I pulled some up and discovered that I could basically demo the whole floor with my bare hands!&nbsp; Its crumbling all around very easily.<br /><br />After a lot of research, I found (at least I think so) that this material is gypcrete.&nbsp; All the info i have seen says to remove it and start over.&nbsp; This is where my question comes in...<br /><br />If you remove the gypcrete, vacuum, and clean the area, there is a metal mesh at the bottom.&nbsp; The floor is also not level with small humps, and is about 1.5 inches shorter.&nbsp; How have you or your contractors gone about laying a new floor?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m trying to figure this out before I either attempt it myself or hire someone to do it.&nbsp; In my mind it makes sense to pour on a floor leveling compund, then thinset, then screw down the hardie backerboard, and then more thinset and tile.&nbsp; There are a lot of opinions on this on the interwebs, so i wanted to see what some locals have seen on their own projects.<br /><br />If this is totally wrong, or right, i&#039;d love it if someone could let me know.&nbsp; Thanks guys!
