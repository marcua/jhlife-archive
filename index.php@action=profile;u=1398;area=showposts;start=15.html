If there is 60% of one thing, and 10% of a few others, that is not diversity. And yes, I don&#039;t like law brakers, and I like them a lot less when the government forces me to educate the children they make irresponsibly, I like them less when I see my daughter in-law every day struggling with her baby taken her to the baby-sitter, and going to work, and I see the law breakers with 4,5, and more kids staying home with their kids. The government supports them, forces the hard-working people to support those abusers, and that is called <strong>ABUSE</strong>Now, if you don&#039;t care to support children you didn&#039;t make, then go ahead and support them, don&#039;t force me to do something I don&#039;t want to do.

Is it restaurant employees who stand outside and try to get customers to come in by telling them what&#039;s on the menu ? Is that what this thread is about ?? Is it such a serious threat to law and order in our neighborhoods that restaurants should try to get business <img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /><br /><br />There&#039;s a small section in the east Village around 9th St. that has several small Indian Restaurants in it where the employees actually compete for would be patrons by &quot;calling out&quot; their menus. The practice is somewhat expected down there and some people go there specifically for that experience. If it&#039;s helped the local economy in the East Village stay afloat why should we frown on it here ? Personally I&#039;ve never seen it in JH, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />The closest I&#039;ve come to such an experience is with Mehfil, if I stop by on my way home and contemplate the menu they have outside, I&#039;m often greeted by a nice guy who seems like their waiter / manager who opens the door and invites me in. It&#039;s a great &quot;gimick&quot; I usually go in and order something. I&#039;m made to feel welcome, appreciated and respected.

You make it seem like we ran for the hills, at the first sight of problems. I grew up on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the tracks from you. I grew up on the other side. Hampton street between Baxter and Brittion Ave. Where I grew up it wasn&#039;t doctors and lawyers..it was cops and firemen. I saw 2 men executed in front of me, and another man shot in the lobby of the York building who bleed to death in front of me and my buddies.3 murders in for a 12 year old kid to witness . Plus a 10 year old girl raped on the roof of that&nbsp; same building . THATS WHY PEOPLE LEFT. Not racism . Now I&#039;m glad JH is coming back, but lets not forget what happened in the past either. And I didn&#039;t move to Long Island&nbsp; or&nbsp; Manhattan. We moved 40 blocks down Roosevelt Ave in October 1984. And it was like going back 25 years in time. Didn&#039;t have to worry about muggings, rapes or murders&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am surprise to find this post here. I posted yesterday a few links, and were deleted. We lived on 72nd. Street between 41st. Ave. and Woodside Ave. and we paid $270.00 a month for a two bed-room apartment, it was a small very well kept building which belonged to Lefrak City. To my surprise, I went to see how the building looks today, and I found out that it looks even better. That street was very nice, even when the neighborhood started to decline. I still have friends there, and they tell me that there are prostitution businesses galore in JH. run by illegal. The economy will collapse if they were deported.

People understand much better each other when they communicate. I don&#039;t say no to what you say, and that is exactly the point I have been trying to make, but some have taken it as an offense. What good is it if the food is delicious, the unique items one can find, if it is not appetizing? Probably it is appetizing to those who don&#039;t care if it is dirty, but does it attract other people? Is it a place where people make a special trip to go to the restaurants and shops? I don&#039;t think so. I hate to mention it again, but I have to do it to see if you understand what I mean, just don&#039;t get mad. Go to Austin Ave. in Forest Hills, it is inviting, I make special trips there with my friends, there are restaurants there too, and all kind of businesses , and a lot of people, and it does not look, or feel, as if you are in a third world country. Probably it is dangerous at night, I don&#039;t know that, but it is not the feeling one gets. I wish the residents luck with their project to improve the neighborhood. But if the politicians don&#039;t enforce rules if there are any, nor make them, then what good is it?&nbsp; And yes, Elmhurst was nice when I was there, and I think it is still nice. </strong>

As a young kid I was never allowed to cross to the &quot;other side of the tracks&quot; heck I wasn&#039;t allowed on Roosevelt Avenue and probably with good reason.<br /><br />I&#039;m not placing 100% responsibility for the downfall of a neighborhood&nbsp; on whether its residents stayed or left. As you point out there are several other factors&nbsp; that contribute to problems a community faces. The drug trade already present in the area prior to the Crack Epidemic being one of them. I&#039;m willing to bet different neighborhoods also received better or worse city services (police, fire, EMS, etc.) based in large part on who lived there, political ties, socio-economic status, etc. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;As you point out there are several other factors&nbsp; that contribute to problems a community faces&quot;. <strong>Yes, one of those factors is the money hungry landlords. They rent the apartments to those illegal, and that is the result. How about the politicians in town? Don&#039;t they see all the wrong things that go on? One of the reasons FH didn&#039;t go bad is because they have rules, and regulations. They would not allowed dirty store fronts, and women at the door of the restaurants calling out loud the menu.

If you Google Map 35th Avenue or 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights and select &quot;Street View&quot;, you&#039;ll see the type of area it is.

During the day, in a very exclusive neighborhood a friend of mine was parked on her drive way taking her groceries out of the car, she put her hand-bag on top of the hood of the car, and a man came from nowhere and took it. This is a neighborhood where you don&#039;t see a soul in the streets. Yes, things can happen anywhere. For me what is important is to have the public transportation close, I don&#039;t like to have to drive to work, specially to Manhattan where parking is so expensive. What kind of transportation you take from 35th Ave. to Manhattan?
