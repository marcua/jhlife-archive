				On a walk earlier tonight, I happened to notice that we have 2 more empty storefronts.&nbsp; The first one is on 37th Avenue next door to the thrift shop, and the other one is the old party goods store that was situated next door to the buxom mannequins also on 37th.&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; I thought the mannequins were moving to 82nd?

				The busty mannequin store has a For Rent sign on it. Is it for the party store - which isn&#039;t all That old. There are&nbsp; a few more empty store fronts on Northern between 82 and 79th.<br /><br />One store owner on 37th, a small store, told a friend his rent is $7000/mo. Wow! Not so good in this economy, is it?

				I&#039;m not sure if this is one of the storefronts you mentioned, Chuckster, but I haven&#039;t seen Lady Algene Jewelers open in the past couple of years.<br /><br />On the flip side, we&#039;ll be having three new eateries opening soon: Delhi Heights in the old Kababbish space on 74th Street, Original American Chicken where 30 Minute Photo and the Legal Documents store once were, and another Indian restaurant where Baskin Robbins has stood empty for a while.&nbsp; Hopefully there are more new ventures in the works.

				After being closed for several months after failing a health inspection, the name has finally been removed from the front of Fiesta Mexicana at 75-02 Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; So at long last, this place is officially gone.<br /><br />A moment of silence, please, for the passing of a short-lived gem.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you.&nbsp; Fiesta Mexicana was excellent, for a couple of months after it opened.&nbsp; It served an upscale style of Mexican cuisine, and had sharp flavors and fresh ingredients.&nbsp; For a while, a sign on its window bragged that they served the &quot;Best Posole in Town!&quot; and if you tasted it, it was easy to believe.&nbsp; But then the chef left (later to resurface in Astoria (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=279.0)), and the restaurant went into a sad decline.<br /><br />On the positive side, we now have an attractive and prominent restaurant space available across the street from the subway station.&nbsp; It&#039;s a perfect location for an exciting newcomer.&nbsp; French Bistro, anyone?

				Never having run a business or invested in one successfully, I can&#039;t pretend that I have any idea.&nbsp; But a wide range of good restaurants are thriving to the west on Roosevelt, to the north on 74th, and to the south on Broadway and on 74th.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know why the part of Roosevelt just east of the subway station is a dead zone for good restaurants, but I don&#039;t see why it has to be that way.&nbsp; This particular corner is more visible and receives more foot traffic than virtually anywhere else, and should be able to support a crowd from breakfast until the wee hours.&nbsp; A bistro or other midrange restaurant would definitely be a change of character for this intersection, but if done right I think it would certainly be supported by both residents and visitors alike.&nbsp; If it serves food that is distinctive, then it will also receive a steady stream of customers via the subway, just like Sripraphai.<br />

				I agree that a restaurant like Sripraphai would do well on this corner, but then that wouldn&#039;t be all that distinctive from what else is nearby.&nbsp; We already have a few Thai places in the neighborhood.&nbsp; What separates Srip is the continued fanfare that it receives from many New Yorkers, not just Queens residents.&nbsp; Generally speaking, people are willing to travel for good food, but would that apply to a square peg in a round hole?&nbsp; That&#039;s how I would perceive a French bistro on Roosevelt.&nbsp; At least for now that is.<br /><br />Your scenario kind of reminds me of Limoncello, the Italian restaurant located south of Roosevelt in the 80s.&nbsp; People seem to be surprised that there&#039;s an Italian restaurant in that part of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I wonder if the locale affects the restaurant&#039;s business.

				Not sure if this has already been mentioned, but it appears that construction on the building adjacent to the Mark Twain Diner on Northern Blvd. has been completed...at least the facade.&nbsp; It looks like a mixed use building that will probably have some office space available.&nbsp; The color and design reminds me of some of the smaller office buildings that are found in Southern Florida.

				I followed up on last week&#039;s call and actually went to Limoncello&#039;s for dinner this evening--they are very much&nbsp; open and in business.&nbsp; This was my second time there and like the first, it was great.&nbsp; After a shared appetizer of calamari and an antipasto I had the Chicken Scarp, which is very tasty.&nbsp; My friends had the skirt steak and a striped bass.&nbsp; We thoroughly enjoyed the evening and recommend it to all.&nbsp; Happily the rumor of its closing was just that, this place is very much open and worthy of a visit.&nbsp; Mangia bene.&nbsp;

				So, the other day i was walking around and i noticed since tierra&#039;s colombiana&#039;s closed they have already put up a new sign called tierras ricas (I guess it will be something like a bakery/restaurant, like SEBA SEBA) or something like that but the thing is, it&#039;s only half of what the original space of the restaurant use to be, the other half is up for sale. On another note Bank of America is looking good (even though there stock dropped today). Now to wonder is who is looking&nbsp; to lease the KB Toy&#039;s space? Once they move. Is this the part where we all think of amazing stores that could open up?&nbsp; and than we get heart broken by seeing some cheap tacky boutique with skanky clothes, maybe a vitamin shop, or maybe it can become the MEGA 99 cent Store the biggest one in Jackson Heights because you know how much we all love to shop there. lol.

				sadly folks, the situation in JH is bleak and the landlords most of which don&#039;t live the neighborhood at all aren&#039;t helping.&nbsp; much of the square footage available is on building that have been paid YEARS ago, yet landlords are sticking to charging what they believe to be market rates, but in fact are impossible rents for many if not ALL of the business&#039; along 37th Roosevelt and Northern.&nbsp; northern is a little more protected because building ownership is more varied and some of the stores are run by the building owners, but on 37th and Roosevelt entire blocks are owned by single landlords or community trusts.&nbsp; in either case i worry about the resolve and relative deep pockets shops are going to need to stay afloat.&nbsp; in the meantime i encourage everyone to by local as much as possible, as tempting as buying at the large chain stores is, buy local and keep the community thriving... empty shops leads to more despair and greater insecurity.

				I&#039;m not sure why we need the chain stores on 37th ave. just so we can look like Austin or Steinway Streets ? With both those districts so close it would seem to me that smaller unique stores that have a closer tie to the community are what makes Jackson Heihgts Unique and a little special.&nbsp; Character is just as important as convenience and these retailers would have a negative impact on the character of our lovely little neighborhood.&nbsp; Secondly, if you think we have congestion problems now, just wait until these big name retailers rear their ugly heads.

				We all like mom and pop shops , but in reality who could count the ones left in one hand in Jackson Heights , there all pretty much gone unfortunately Jackson Heights is not what it once was , i think the only way to revitalize our retail strips and get back on the top of the retail game is to have national chains enter the neighborhood , new times call for new changes and i think now is the time since we have so many open retail spaces . Unfortunately , were in a recession now and national chains are downsizing in general. But, if national chains are present soon , were going to end up with all of those crappy thong shops , 2 are OK , but most of our shopping retail consists of it , ew . Also , the commercial property owners are not collaborating with those exorbitant monthly rates, also Jackson Heights has the demographics to support it and they will ptrtty up the strips like 82nd st and 37th ave

				The problem with encouraging any new and different type of stores are the rents being charged.&nbsp; The Starbucks location is paying in the neighborhood of $10,000 per month.&nbsp; Or at least that was what they were asking before Starbucks took it over.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to make anything work in the neighborhood as long as the rents are so high.&nbsp; There are so many things we could use like: restaurants other than Indian or Latino. Great as they are there are too many.&nbsp; How about a nice casual Italian restaurant or a place for a good glass of wine and a salad or burger. We keep gravitating to other neighborhoods because our offerings are too limited.&nbsp; Look at Astoria and the different restaurants.&nbsp; J Hts can do the same if the rents weren&#039;t so prohibitive. Maybe landlords would be willing to take a lower rent and a % of the profits?

				An &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; products store moved into one of the empty spaces on 37th between 85th and 87th (can&#039;t remember which block exactly).&nbsp; However, it does not look like it&#039;s there to stay, as no attempt was made to make it look like an actual store, and there are still &quot;for rent&quot; signs in the window.<br /><br />And disappointingly, the pharmacy that&#039;s set to go into the space next to Tomo could not even be bothered to put the vinyl letters and numbers stating their store hours on the glass straight.&nbsp; For me that&#039;s a really bad sign for a pharmacy that you want to be able to depend on to be accurate and fastidious since presumably you are trusting them with your medications.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are so many things I don&#039;t understand about retail here.

				that&#039;s too bad about deshi. the food was really amazing when they opened -- the fish dishes were off the chart good and they had a flair for bangladeshi dishes that you seldom saw anywhere else, done super home style. since reopening from renovations, things changed dramatically for the worse. resulting in the dropoff in business that (i guess) killed the place.

				I wonder if landlords are holding out for big chain retailers. Those types of companies can afford higher rents, sign longer leases and generally stay in a location longer.

				I have just learned about the Cavilear closing....<br /><br />Yes this is sad to see, I just wonder that if major retailers move in will that jack up the apartment rentals as well as the Co-ops/ Condos, and the storefront rents even more?

				But in many cases these businesses weren&#039;t struggling until the landlords decided to jack up the rents--that does seem to be peculiar to our neighborhood. The concept of supply/demand breaks down when landlords don&#039;t care that there&#039;s no demand at the prices they are asking, and are willing to leave spaces open for years on end.

				<br />the problem with that kind of change -- at least insofar as it applies to willamsburg and astoria -- is that the new stores never last. they die on the vine after three, six or 12 months. very very few stay in business, because, frankly, while people may need a jar of tasmanian sea salt or a vintage feather boa (or, less sarcastically, a luxury item like a custom leather briefcase) every once in a great while, they aren&#039;t things that one needs to stop in for every tuesday and thursday. i lived in astoria for a few years, before the rents tripled, and the old-school places were fading, but had been there for three, four, five decades. once they were displaced, the turnover became a yearly thing in a lot of stores along broadway and 30th. i am not saying that change is, in and of itself, bad. but it&#039;s not, in and of itself, good.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=867.msg26872.html#msg26872">Quote from: Griswold Contessa on February 08, 2010, 05:02:19 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Like it or not this neighborhood is changing and the landlords are aware of this therefore the stores will change along with the population. &nbsp;I am sure this very same thing happened in Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, Williamsburg and Astoria. &nbsp;I think it&#039;s called re-gentrification. &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Shelby,<br /><br />Yes, the store is clean and the clothes are neatly folded, but this is the exact same appearance as when the store was up on Roosevelt and 84/85 (by the T-Mobile place)&nbsp; <br /><br />They set up shop there for 4 months or so and for the duration of their tenancy, never improved the appearance of their store beyond that.<br /><br />It&#039;s barely a step up from being a street vendor who sells bootleg merch on the street.&nbsp; Same nomadic retailers, same folding tables, just hopping storefronts as opposed to street corners.<br /><br />Do you really feel that sort of operation provides a value to the community, or would you rather see someone establish a business that wants to set roots in the neighborhood and improve the quality of life or just offer clean, well-folded merchandise on nomadic folding tables?<br />

				Update on the former Gothic Cabinet Craft to the left of the Jackson House Restaurant (Diner) between 82nd and 83rd. &nbsp;It had been papered over with a for rent sign above the door. &nbsp;<br /><br />The for rent sign is still there, but half the paper is gone, revealing a clothing store that seems to have a specific design style with various kinds of wallpaper and track lighting. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t get a good look at the clothing, but it is visible through the glass. &nbsp;The small temporary sign on the door says www.pulsenyc.com and I think it listed several other locations. &nbsp;The website doesn&#039;t work well for me and I wasn&#039;t able to click on the locations tab online. &nbsp;I think it may be a small chain. &nbsp;There is no formal signage anywhere else so I guess there is a chance that the store is actually going to be called something else.

Right now, we&#039;re selling books on 34th Avenue (between 79th and 80th) every Sunday from 10am-2pm (weather permitting) and donating half of the proceeds to local aid organizations. Check us out at openbordersbooks.org (http://openbordersbooks.org) and come by to say hi!<br /><br />Yours,<br />Jeff
