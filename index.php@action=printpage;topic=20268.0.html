				Does anyone know where I can get a few slices of cooked turkey breast without all the fixings in the neighborhood. As far as I know we don&#039;t have a prepared food place like a Zabars where one could get this but I want to make my own sides and just pick up some turkey.<br />Thank you!

				one of the diner places might be willing to do that....try calling Jax Inn to ask. they&#039;re usually pretty accommodating and they make a nice turkey. also, Boston Market&#039;s Woodside location is a possibility.

				Donovans on 58th and Roosevelt has Thanksgiving dinner for $14.95 a person.&nbsp; Basically the same price as Boston Market and you are supporting a struggling locally owned business.

				November 16th Donovan&#039;s posted on their Facebook page about Thanksgiving meals for $14.95.<br /><br />Turkey, turkey stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, choice of mashed potatoes or turnips, choice of string beans or corn.<br /><br />I have not seen any place that is cheaper.

				On Thanksgiving Day at around 1PM, I was in the Bay Terrace Shopping Center and I counted over 80 people outside in line at Boston Market&nbsp; waiting to pickup their Thanksgiving meal.&nbsp; I have no idea about&nbsp; the quality of the food or if the line was moving at a reasonable pace but a lot of people&nbsp; tried this option.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it was a lot less expensive than many restaurant options.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am commenting now because I am sure every year there are people who don&#039;t have other options. Fortunately for those waiting outside, the weather was&nbsp; spectacular for this time of year.

Single. Year. It&#039;s cheap. Affordable, and surprisingly tasty. This year is worse since they limit customers inside, but kudo to the employees who work there. I wished people could support local businesses, but at least the chains are hiring local New Yorkers.
