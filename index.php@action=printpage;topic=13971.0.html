				Article in real estate news:<br /><br />Families set price record with Jackson Heights rentals (http://rew-online.com/2015/11/11/families-set-price-record-with-jackson-heights-rentals/)<br /><br />A coveted Jackson Heights rental building has switched hands between two low-key Queens families.<br /><br />Marcus and Millichap broker Marco Lala said the 70-unit, two-elevator 35-33 83rd Street sold for just south of $30 million.<br /><br />The building is one of only two non-condo residential structures in the immediate area, according to Lala, who represented the sellers, the Vorillas family, which had owned the property for over 40 years.<br /><br />The buyers wish to remain anonymous, but Lala said that they are also a multi-generational real estate family.<br /><br />Noting the property’s proximity to the 7 train’s stop at 82nd Street, Lala pointed out that, when it closes, the sale of 35-33rd 83rd Street will set a new local record with a 2.5 cap rate and over 22 times the rent roll.<br /><br />“Jackson Heights is a very hot market right now, along with Astoria,ˮ said Lala, who also just closed on the $8.65 million sale of 1530 York Ave on the Upper East Side and is in contract on a 13-story high rise with 96 units at 1514 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.

				This new article has updated info about this big sale.<br /><br />http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/12/28/leemar-management-buys-jackson-heights-rental-for-26m/<br /><br />(http://s13.therealdeal.com/trd/up/2015/12/Jackson-Heights-Multifamily.jpg)<br /><br />UPDATED, 5:22 p.m., Dec. 28: Lee Wallach’s Leemar Management paid $25.5 million for a six-story rental building in Jackson Heights, a northwestern Queens neighborhood often overlooked by multifamily investors. The 78,378-square-foot elevator property at 35-33 83rd Street sold for the first time in more than 40 years. <br /><br />The Long Island-based management firm closed on the purchase last week for $325 per square foot, one of the higher prices in the area, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap’s Marco Lala, who served as the broker. On a price-per-unit basis for a non-new-construction asset, the deal was one of the most expensive in Jackson Heights, at nearly $365,000 per unit, Lala said. <br /><br />The building, constructed in 1930, has 70 apartments and a 13,000-square-foot basement. Rents range from $962 to $2,800 per month. Lala and his team marketed it as a long-term investment opportunity. - See more at: http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/12/28/leemar-management-buys-jackson-heights-rental-for-26m/#sthash.aZgQoMBI.dpuf

Doesn&#039;t seem like there is any mixed-use commercial space either -- so they will need to buy-out a lot of the rent stabilized renters in order to make the cash-flow on this work. Another longer-term option I can see here -- converting the building to condo&#039;s and selling. They could get about $400k per one-bedroom if they were in good condition and marketed right.

Reading between the lines of the article &quot;Lala and his team marketed it as a long-term investment opportunity&quot; - that usually signals that the numbers on the building currently aren&#039;t that great, but can improve in the future. The field for speculation is wide open on this one for sure: future condo conversion, temporary tax shelter, leveraged investment, expectation of rent increases... you name it. But I remember when Joseph Moinian was asked why he is &quot;overpaying&quot; for the buildings he began to purchase, he replied &quot;I&#039;d rather overpay today, than overpay thee times over tomorrow&quot; :) <br /><br />

They can&#039;t foce tenants to leave and it&#039;s tenant&#039;s choice to accept or decline. <br /><br />There are documented cases of neighbors getting together and hiring legal help to negotiate with the landlord. There are also other cases of tenants who held out longer than the neighbors and sold for a LOT more. Herb Sukenik, last tenant at 15 Central Park West apparently receivd $17M in final payoff... yes SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS! Then Tishman Speyer apparantly paid 25 millin to convince two small apartmen tenants to vacate - on their Hudson Yards site ... Fun stories to google :)&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;
