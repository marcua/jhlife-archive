			Mine did as well .. still does, as it at my mom&#039;s house.&nbsp; All I could figure was the N was Newtown, still not sure on the R.<br /><br />In fact, my phone number, which I first got for my 14th birthday, has followed me to 4 apartments in Jackson Heights.

			Yeah I had the 672 at my folks ome on 76th Street, and and then as my own that amea ddress that followed me around.&nbsp; And my mom had her original NR2 in the building on 81st before ours.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also an ex-girlfriend in high school had 672, just a few numbers above mine, and she lived across from the Jackson Theater ...<br /><br />I think NR meant something else, or else North Ridge means more than the complex??

			How about Illinois with the exchange being IL.&nbsp; Elmhurst/Newtown HS area.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />--- Quote from: 20th Century Boy on March 10, 2010, 11:27:39 AM ---Named telephone exchanges are relics of a bygone era; then again, so am I. The Jackson Heights exchanges I remember from the period before the conversion to numbered exchanges in the 1960&#039;s are: DEfender, HAvemeyer, HIckory, ILlinois, NEwtown and TWining. &nbsp;Can anybody remember any others?<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br />
