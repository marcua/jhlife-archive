					Hi there,<br /><br />We are about to sign contract to purchase a coop in the 83rd street and 37th Avenue area.&nbsp; I&#039;m super-stressed about the parking situation there because I heavily rely on my car for work.&nbsp; The private lot charges a ridiculous amount of money to park and it is valet parking only.&nbsp; Does anyone know how hard it is to street park in that area?&nbsp; Also, are rent-able parking spots available in the area?<br /><br />Any information would be greatly appreciated--thanks so much!<br /><br />Eva

					Hi all,<br /><br />Love all the restaurant suggestions here.&nbsp; I wanted some suggestions on your favorite spots for a quick, cheap lunch around the area.&nbsp; Usually I go to:<br /><br />a) <strong>Juju Bagel Cafe</strong>: Love their bagel sandwiches!&nbsp; Plus, they have an awesome drink selection (orangina!)<br /><br />b) <strong>Food cart on Northern Boulevard between 73rd and 72nd (next to TD Bank)</strong>: This food cart is one of the best I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; The guy is really clean and sanitary and the food is different from the other carts.&nbsp; Plus, he&#039;s super nice and friendly (which goes a long way in my book).<br /><br />c) <strong>Himalayan Hut</strong>: I tried their lunch special and it was pretty good--the momo dumplings are amazing.<br /><br />Check these places out and let me know where you go for lunch!

					And one last thing about the garbage issue:&nbsp; I also notice that the garbage cans are overflowing and that garbage does not get picked up in a timely manner on that street.&nbsp; I think that just adds to the problem when you have so much foot traffic.&nbsp; Matters might be helped if the Department of Sanitation paid a little bit more attention to that street.<br /><br />Maybe there can be a campaign to encourage people to be clean--signs in Hindi, Urdu and Bangla stating, &quot;Please throw your trash away&quot; along with extra trash cans. I&#039;m a social psychologist and there are numerous studies that indicate that reminders in the forms of signs can have surprisingly good effects.&nbsp;

					Sorry for offending anyone--I just want the discussion to focus on the issues at hand--like the things that matter.&nbsp; I think we&#039;re going to lose this battle if we start tacking on questionable personal offendings and posting things that I find hard to believe happened.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;m being unreasonable.&nbsp; I want to see this street be clean, safe and comfortable for ALL parties.<br /><br />If I pulled the race card then y&#039;all pulled the &quot;you pulled the race card&quot; card.&nbsp; I just want the discussion to be balanced and focused.&nbsp;

					Trash, littering, illicit activities, drug dealing, urinating, etc: NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND HALTED. &nbsp;Totally not acceptable.<br /><br />Random comments about &quot;threatening&quot; street vendors (the majority of whom seem to be extremely elderly men over the age of 65) on 73rd, tacky ethnic decorations, being supposedly consistently spat on and coughed at, limiting store hours to your liking: I&#039;m not so sure how productive or valid these are in terms of complaints and battles. &nbsp;<br /><br />Welcome to NYC, folks. &nbsp;There&#039;s always Greendale, Wisconsin if you want it to be tailor-made to your liking. &nbsp;That&#039;s my home-town and I left it because everything was too perfect--the stores close at 8pm promptly, everyone&#039;s lawn is perfectly mowed, almost everyone looks and acts the same and the sidewalk is clean enough to eat off of. &nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of the very threatening and hateful street vendors that are mentioned, I notice that some of the elderly men physically haul their street carts with much difficulty. &nbsp;One of the men hauls it up 73rd street every early afternoon and it takes him so long to get his cart there that it&#039;s hard to watch. &nbsp;He has to take long rests. &nbsp;I once bought an incense holder from him and asked him why he does it every day; he said he needs it to pay his room share rent because no one will hire him because he&#039;s so old. &nbsp;He&#039;s not an illegal immigrant, just a green card holder who apparently left a very poor village in Bangladesh. &nbsp;He was so horribly threatening to me that at the end of our conversation, he gave me free beads (like rosary or something). &nbsp;So remember that some of these people are just trying to make a living. &nbsp;By some turn of fate, we were born into situations where we are coop share-holders and have time, money and ability to post on this board. &nbsp;Any one of us could have easily been in that old man&#039;s shoes. &nbsp;And no, he didn&#039;t spit on me or threaten to destroy me in some Muslim way at the end our conversation.

					I see--I didn&#039;t realize the situation was that bad. &nbsp;I never saw the cell phone store house area so I concur that it has to be stopped. &nbsp;I&#039;m glad the meeting had representation from a lot of parties. &nbsp;I hope this gets resolved and the streets get cleaned up-literally and figuratively-soon!<br /><br />I hail from an Italian background but my sister-in-law (who I am very close with) is a Bangladeshi Muslim. &nbsp;We&#039;re both really surprised that people would say, &quot;I&#039;m Muslim and you don&#039;t know what I can do to you&quot; to people, especially in light of the fact that a lot of Muslims feel really afraid all the time. &nbsp;<strong><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">NYC Peromyscus</span></strong>, I sort of think that you make sweeping blanket statements about things in the neighborhood that can appear to border on racism and bigotry. &nbsp;I am not sure if you harbor some sort of inner dislike for the ethnic population of 73rd street, etc. (as a viewing of your history of comments would seem to indicate) or if that is just my perception. &nbsp;I apologize if I am perceiving your comments incorrectly and I do hope that is the case. &nbsp;It is a little bizarre to me that many people would come up and &quot;I&#039;m a Muslim and you don&#039;t know what I can to you&quot; sort of comments as well as I think it is bizarre that multiple people have &quot;coughed&quot; in your face on 73rd street. &nbsp;I have lived here for 7 years now as have many close friends. &nbsp;We were all looking at this board together last night over some wine and, frankly, your Jackson Heights experiences seem a bit exaggerated and propelled by what might be a dislike of the ethnic populations that inhabit corners of Jackson Heights. &nbsp;Like I&#039;ve always said, we should definitely clean things up and make the neighborhood as beautiful and nice as possible but if you&#039;re looking for a gentrified block with &quot;controlled exoticness,&quot; this might not be it for you...<br /><br />I seriously am not trying to offend anyone here--I totally see your point of view, residents.&nbsp; Action should be taken.&nbsp; As a resident of 73rd street, I would like to see things being cleaner too.&nbsp; I just think that calling signs &quot;tacky&quot; or commenting on hygienic habits of a group of people is a little ugly.&nbsp; Think about what you are saying and why you might be saying it...

					&quot;I understand that they have different standard in terms of cleaness but they have to realize that the street is shared by people from other cultures and they can&#039;t force their standard to the public street.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br /><br />Like the above quote is kinda ugly...&quot;They&quot; have different standards of cleanliness?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also what was said about &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings, everyone&quot;--&nbsp; Why is it such a bother to you if some people put up a &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings&quot; sign?&nbsp; And who knows who paid for that sign or how it was paid for?&nbsp; <br /><br />As long as you regard your ethnic neighbors as being second-class citizens with no standards, you&#039;re not going to get anywhere.&nbsp; A little respect in terms of discourse might go a long way and might lead to productive collaboration in cleaning up the neighborhood.&nbsp; You can attract a lot more bees with honey, my friends.<br /><br />

					Hmm...I had to think long and hard about the issues at hand here and here is my humble opinion:<br /><br />I am sorry that the people of Sheila Terrace feel like their street has changed but the truth is, in an urban environment, neighborhoods and streets can change over time.&nbsp; That&#039;s what happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, there should definitely be steps taken to help clean up the area.&nbsp; Perhaps an alliance can be forged with the vendors and the business owners to take care of the area.&nbsp; A meeting should be held with all parties present.&nbsp; If there are complaint meetings, how can cooperation be expected.<br /><br />But I feel uneasy to think that what I am hearing is essentially people saying that they have more of a right to the street than the other people who occupy it.&nbsp; The business owners and their customers have just as much of a right to be there.&nbsp; It might be too &quot;exotic&quot; for some people but honestly, as someone else mentioned before, it&#039;s one of the best things about the neighborhood.&nbsp; I live on 73rd between 37th and 35th so almost of all my visitors come down 73rd to see me.&nbsp; Everyone loves the area--the sights, the smells, the sounds.&nbsp; I happen to love seeing the street vendors and all the crazy sights and sounds.&nbsp; I love that these stores are open late or 24 hours--I feel safe when I walk home late at night.&nbsp; It is what makes New York City great--these people made a street their own.&nbsp; <br /><br />It might be nice to have everything be white-washed and so-called historic but this is New York City!&nbsp; There are plenty of &quot;clean,&quot; gentrified blocks to move to, if needed...

					Yes--totally agree!<br /><br />While we are on the topic of 73rd street, I also want to state how terrible it is to walk down 73rd (between 35th and 37th) when the building put out their trash.&nbsp; In the summertime the trash just reeks all night, sometimes not getting picked up until 8am.&nbsp; So gross--I wonder if anything can be done about it.&nbsp; The sidewalk is narrow and sometimes, I&#039;ve grazed the leaky trash bags as I was walking...
