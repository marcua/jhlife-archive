				Are any barber shops open?&nbsp; If not, does anyone know a barber who does house calls or cuts hair in their home in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I did a search and found nothing.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

				Im not sure it’s such a good idea, but I did see a barber advertising this service in a local Facebook group (Forest Hills area). He said he does at home cuts with social distancing which to me seems impossible. I don’t know anything about him besides what he posted, so I guess you’d be taking your chances. In any case, I will send you the Facebook link by personal message. I didn’t see any other way to contact him besides Facebook.

				This topic seems to be irresponsible.&nbsp; Barber and beauty shops were closed for a reason. Is there an essential need for a haircut or shave? <br />There will be plenty of time for the barber shop, hopefully in a few weeks. Time to let your freak flag fly,

				I agree. This is not an essential service, and you put yourself or barbers and their immediate contacts at risk. Please don&#039;t do this.

				This doesn&#039;t seem to be irresponsible, IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE. <br /><br />You CANNOT cut hair, color hair, or shave someone and maintain a minimum of six feet. Not even Edward Scissorhands could do that. Haircuts are not essential. Getting your roots colored is not essential. Having someone else trim a beard is not essential.<br /><br />https://youtu.be/Uo2clI631uA?t=36 (https://youtu.be/Uo2clI631uA?t=36)

				OP: I just read this on another board: &quot;The state licensing department sent out letters telling all hairdressers &amp; barbers that they were to cease cutting hair or risk having their licenses revoked&quot;<br /><br />Maybe you could Google to see if it&#039;s accurate.

				oh for Pete&#039;s sake, there&#039;s a reason not a single salon or barber shop is open. Getting a haircut, your nails done, or roots touched up is not essential. This isn&#039;t up for debate. This service simply does not qualify from exemption on the governor&#039;s executive order, because **it is not essential.** https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026 (https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026)<br /><br />Any stylist going to visit clients at this point is a potentially a modern Typhoid Mary. And not the Typhoid Mary who didn&#039;t know she was an asymptomatic carrier of Typhoid fever, but the Typhoid Mary who went back to work after she knew she was spreading disease and death. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12wh0lfHb2U (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12wh0lfHb2U)

				You&#039;ll save a few dollars and show your neighbors you care by not doing it! Get creative with hair gel and other products. Still not happy? Wear a hat! Being camera ready is really not important right now. SAFETY IS!

				Hi I keep my hair rather short- and Andy the Barber on 37th Ave always does a great job.<br />I needed a haircut too so I watch some how to videos on YouTube using electric clippers. I think my first attempt went rather well.<br />I didn&#039;t go crazy just trimmed up the sides and back. Besides, if I really messed it up Im not seeing anyone or going anywhere lol<br />You can get inexpensive clippers at Right-Aid , etc.

				Someone should forward this thread&nbsp; to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who after making several PSA&#039;s about this very topic goes and gets her haircut stating that &quot;b/c she&#039;s out in the public eye and takes her personal hygiene very seriously&quot;.&nbsp; What arrogance.&nbsp; Does that mean that everyone else is rolling around in mud all day.&nbsp; She , unlike us, takes her hygiene very seriously.&nbsp; &nbsp;SERIOUSLY!&nbsp; And De Blasio taking off to the gym.&nbsp;
