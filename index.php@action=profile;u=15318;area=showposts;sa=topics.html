					Hi All-<br />I hope this message finds you well. There is a yoga class tonight (and every Monday night) at MKD School of Karate at 7:00pm. For the remaining month of September the focus will be acquainting ourselves with the basics of breath, movement, and relaxation. The intention is to give our busy minds a rest while we practice feeling more at home and present in our bodies. &quot;We begin where we are and how we are, and whatever happens, happens.&quot;- T.K.V Desikachar<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you at class. If you have any questions, please contact me.<br />Warmly,<br />Abigail<br /><br /><br />Live In Vision Yoga, or LIV Yoga is a modern interpretation of Yoga that appeals to students who want a dynamic, creative approach to navigating the body, mind, and spirit.<br /><br />Students are educated about their body and mind as they deepen their practice and become better acquainted with their self. The environment of the class is supportive and encouraging. Students feel safe and respected and have the freedom to experiment in a non-competitive space.<br /><br />Abigail acknowledges the uniqueness of each body and encourages students to do their best while trusting themselves and their bodies. Practice is about one’s state of being.<br /><br />Her classes focus on helping students to practice with self awareness and proper alignment so that students develop a sense of strength, stability, ease and confidence. She is very dedicated to a holistic approach to well-being. Her vision is for her classes to serve as a valuable tool for improving quality of life, both in the studio and out. <a href="http://www.mkdkarate.com/yoga.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.mkdkarate.com/yoga.html</a><br /><br />WHEN: Every Monday @ 7:00-8:00 PM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Classes begin and end on time.<br />WHERE: MKD School of Karate, 72-26 Roosevelt Ave, 2nd Flr, Jackson Heights NY 11372<br />DETAILS: $10 per class<br />All levels and both genders most welcome!<br />The floor is matted.

					Sunday December 16th 2012 2pm-4pm <br />Ages 7-10<br />$40 per child<br />RSVP by December 11, 2012<br /><br />Live In Vision is about fun, connection, self-awareness and growth. This two-hour workshop allows your child to explore personal power and increase his/her self-esteem. <br /><br />Guided by Abigail Wilber, your child will take an imaginative journey through seven aspects of personal power (commitment, discipline, support system, inner guidance, love, lightness, and finding your own truth) and cultivate a healthy relationship with each one. &nbsp;The workshop will include the importance of self-love and the meaning and value of each childâ€™s life. &nbsp;By engaging in creative and fun activities this will help create an additional foundation for a healthy childhood. <br /><br />This program helps your child:<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain confidence in all areas of personal power. <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to set and achieve goals with ease and joy.<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilize the tools for a growth mindset (A growth mindset allows a child to seek out learning opportunities rather than avoid experiences because they do not feel good enough or smart enough).<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be motivated to grow and learn by the power of their dreams, and not be held back by fears and limiting beliefs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Abigail Wilber was inspired to create â€˜Live In Visionâ€™ after participating in the Empowerment Institute program by David Gershon and Gail Straub- two of the worldâ€™s foremost authorities on behavior-change. The powerful learnings that Abigail experienced, combined with her desire to both learn from and help others, encouraged Abigail to develop her own unique series of workshops, specifically tailored to children. Abigailâ€™s workshops incorporate her belief in the power of the mind-body connection, as well as her passion for increased self-awareness through play, and cultivating a growth mindset. She has worked in schools for 15 years and has led workshops at Bard college and State University of New York at New Paltz.

					Hi All- Registration is open for this amazing series for the Spring. Here is a brief summary of the workshop. If you are interested in learning more please contact me. <br /><br />Choose Your Life Story.<br />A Conscious Evolution is a practice of fearlessness. The willingness to explore outside the box of comfort and to boldly go for your dreams. To not allow the world&#039;s consensus view of reality constrain your willingness to use your imagination and push the envelop on ideas that are perceived as naive. It is the willingness to work with unconscious beliefs and heal and transform them so you are a better human being. It&#039;s a commitment to becoming a more conscious person so we have a more conscious world.<br /><br />Discover how to achieve the goals you envision for yourself and gain awareness of beliefs that hold you back. â€“ give yourself the gift of A Conscious Evolution. Allow clarity and commitment and the opportunity to write your life story as you want. Discover whatâ€™s possible and enjoy a more fulfilling life.<br /><br />Closely explore seven areas of life: work, money, the body, relationships, sexuality, emotions and spirituality. In each of these seven areas you are skillfully guided towards the radical courage required to let go of old limiting beliefs and to create fresh new visions for your life. You will discover how to:<br />? Gain insight into where you are now<br />? Clearly design the vision of where you want to be<br />? Uncover and transform limiting beliefs that block you from achieving your vision<br />? Create the next growth step that enables you to achieve concrete behavior change<br />? Learn the tools to sustain your growth over time with a support system in place<br /><br />A Conscious Evolution provides you with the tools to guide your life the way you want it. This workshop is modeled after David Gershon and Gail Straub&#039;s Empowerment Workshop. Over the past thirty years, David and Gail have contributed towards massive social change efforts, as well as to the fields of personal empowerment and organizational development.<br />The premise of the workshop is that your beliefs create the conditions of your life. If you wish to change your life, you need to envision a new possibility and transform the limiting beliefs that are creating your current situation.<br />Life is a choice. It is YOUR life. Choose consciously, choose wisely, choose your life story.<br /><br />e-mail: <a href="mailto:Abigail.Wilber@hotmail.com" class="bbc_email">Abigail.Wilber@hotmail.com</a> for more information<br /><br /><br />??
