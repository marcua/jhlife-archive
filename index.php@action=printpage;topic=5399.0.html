				Does anyone know if there is still a Scrabble club in the Heights? I know there used to be one every first Saturday of the month in the Methodist Community Church. &nbsp;I always meant to go but I never got around to it so I don&#039;t even have a contact person I can reach out to. &nbsp;I tried to Google it but I don&#039;t see it advertised anywhere anymore. &nbsp;I called the Church&#039;s number and left a message so hopefully they&#039;ll get back to me. &nbsp;Anyone know about it?

				So the first Saturday of the month is just a few days away.&nbsp; I still have no new information from the church but according to this website: <br />http://www.cross-tables.com/mapclubs.php<br />the Jackson Heights Scrabble Club #452 has been inactive since March 3, 2009.&nbsp; Total bummer!&nbsp; I wonder if that&#039;s why we have no more scrabble street sign....hmmm.&nbsp; <br />This website says that there are many community clubs that operate out of public libraries and the site is very informative:&nbsp; <br />http://www2.scrabble-assoc.com/sublinks.asp?id=6&amp;sid=92 <br /><br />Now, who is going to be our fearless leader and get this thing started?&nbsp; Star Five......did I hear you volunteer?&nbsp; &nbsp;:coolsmiley:

				Tiny Update...<br /><br />The pastor will be making an announcement during the next service to get some of church members involved as well.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t decided which day&#039;s good for the meetings, but it will either be Saturdays or Sundays and how often...

				We&#039;d have to plan it around church services right?&nbsp; I&#039;m not a member of the church and I don&#039;t know when they have their services but maybe if we had the club right after one of the services people would just trickle in.&nbsp; We can also put up a flyer on the library bulletin board.&nbsp; Maybe we can also notify the Renaissance School down the block and see if any high school students would like to join and of course the parents would be welcome as well.&nbsp; There are plenty of ways to stir up interest....

				Update:<br /><br />I spoke with Rev.

				It was really upsetting for me and my family to learn that the 35th Ave Scrabble Points Street Sign was taken down.&nbsp; &nbsp;The inventor of Scrabble, Alfred Butts, was my Grandmother&#039;s uncle.<br /><br />Today, I was telling some of my coworkers that one of my relatives invented Scrabble.&nbsp; That made me want to google Alfred Butts and Scrabble to see if anything new was written.&nbsp; Much to my delight, I found this post on wanting to restart the Scrabble Club in the church where my great, great uncle worshipped and played Scrabble years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for putting a smile in my heart!<br /><br />Best of luck on getting the club up and running,<br /><br />Also a Scrabble lover!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The original plan is to meet on the first Saturdays of the month like the original Scrabble Club.&nbsp; If this Saturday brings many players, we&#039;ll consider holding the meetings more often.

				Well I was saddened to be the only one there this afternoon.&nbsp; &nbsp;:(<br />I went to the community church at about 430 with my daughter, my friend and her daughter.&nbsp; The people at the church told us we were the only ones that had been there so far.&nbsp; We stayed a few minutes then left.&nbsp; Hopefully by next month there will be some more interest.&nbsp; Maybe it was just too short notice this time around.&nbsp; Oh well....

				Sorry we missed you.&nbsp; I was there with the pastor at 3 and we both decided to leave at 4 since no one else showed up.<br /><br />Let&#039;s try again.<br /><br />Next meeting is July 9 at 3pm.&nbsp; First Saturday is July 4th weekend and many people probably won&#039;t be around.

				I intended to come but couldn&#039;t make it. Honestly though, by bringing your daughter, friend and friend, that is already a success. I think clubs like this is really special, I wouldn&#039;t stop coming until you are the only person there 2x in a row. And you&#039;d be surprised about the holiday weekend... if you are available, you can guarantee that other people are too. and there are probably people wiith no where to go on the holiday. I like doing events then.

				Well I certainly won&#039;t be giving up.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be there again next month, though I&#039;ll probably be solo then.&nbsp; I have faith in this group....we can make it happen!
