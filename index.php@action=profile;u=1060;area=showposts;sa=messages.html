					by:Anthony J Trimboli- If anybody notices an advertisement in any local police precinct concerning that you are required to report a lost or stolen cell phone with NYC Crimestoppers, the advertisement is fake and a lost or stolen cell phone should not be reported to NYC Police Crimestoppers because it is not related to a felony.<br /><br />The advertisement says that cell phone robberies are high on the NYC Subways and if you think, know, or even suspect that your cell phone is lost or stolen, you have the additional option of reporting it to NYC Crimestoppers. You do not. It is a felony and not related and should not be reported to the NYC Crimestoppers office.<br /><br />The information on the advertisement is fake and not correct concerning any large extent of cell phone robberies on the NYC Subways(it was found at the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn in East New York)and how now even if you think you lost your cell phone, you can report it to Crimestoppers. You may not.<br /><br />The info in this ad is fake. I know the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn had this advertisement hanging on the walls. Maybe other precincts around the local area do too.<br /><br />Again, you can not report any lost or stolen cell phones to NYC Crimestoppers or 1-800-577-TIPS. It is not the right number and the 75th Precinct had an ad inside of it that had false information on it.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- This is technically not your community, but I saw a first today on the 46 St Station on the R and V Trains around your community. I usually ride on the A and C Train around where I live and the stations are falling apart horribly. Horribly on the A and C Line. I sometimes take the R and V Trains home and these stations are well maintained including lots of them up there on the 7 Train. There must have been some sort of rust or pipe problem on th 46 Street Station today in Queens, New York with all that water on the ground!!! It was like the station was dripping horribly all day long from the outside pipes outside. This really was a first with the trains here on the R and V Lines--I know the A and C Lines near me can really be horrifying when it comes to having badly maintained stations, but the stations usually on the R and V Lines are usually well maintained. I notified Slattery Plz station when I got off. Wow. I never saw that type of leak before like I saw today with so much water on the ground like the R and V Line&#039;s 46 St Sta today. Again, this is slightly out of your area, but it may be of interest to you.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. I do not like those announcements neither about if you are sick that you should not ride the train or something like that. Quite&nbsp; few sick people do ride the trains and buses and I think those announcements are a waste of time in many ways. Why spend so much money in producing an announcement like that. I just do not think it is worth the time and money to produce a large announcement about sick passengers on the train. is everybody really this sick on the train??? If they are sick, they can get off for certain at the next stop and get off rather than have New York City Transit produce announcements like those. Those are a waste of money, yes. i agree with you on that.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. The buses have that more where they have announcements that are outdated on the bus and subway that tell you special announcements. I have no idea why New York City Transit keeps old announcements out there to be posted to others. They should at least know to remove the special announcements that are old or outdated not to confuse the passenger. But, they have been doing that for years with putting announcements in trains and buses that are old and outdated in nature. I have no idea why they would do so. They are sloppy that way at New York City Transit I guess. I have no idea why they keep outdated announcements, I know they have problems sometimes cleaning the trains and buses and leaving litter on them for a week, maybe they have no time to get the old announcements down-- I know some subway lines like the A and C Trains keep the litter on the floor of the train for about a week in some instances. They actually do that with platforms and trains sometimes on the A and C Lines--it is only by the lines by me too.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I am writing to you to just give you some assistance with this. Lots of people complain about noisy neighbors in areas where there are apartments. Did you try speaking to them??? What kind of noise is it like music or anything like that??? THIS IS JUST PERSONAL OPINION: I would not get the Police involved in anything like this although they should. On many occasions, I do not know if this is also true of your 108th Precinct or whomever services up there, but they often have blown stories out of proportion like they ask too many questions or something. THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, SO LIKE JUST DO NOT GET THEM IN THIS NOR 311 PER SE. They really can blow things out of proportion. I would suggest like talking to him or to the landlord or to just another neighbor on the floor who may be more able to meet him and talk to him about the noise. I have used 311 and the NYPD for complaints like that and they blow things out of proportion(this is just my opinion-- you do not need six police cars on your street because he started a hassle with them and they feel sorry for you at the 108th or whomever services up there--the 108th or 110th). Just try to get a landlord or try to perhaps get a neighbor around the noisy neighbor to speak with him. What noise is this??? I am sure he or she may stop if somebody speaks to him. Again, JUST MY OPINION-- DO NOT YELL AT ME-- do not get things like 311 or the Police there--they sometimes blow things out of proportion like he could yell at them or have drugs in the house and they find violations in the apartment and all of a sudden, you have like six cop cars on your block because you simply asked the police to control the noise next door. It has happened to me and it really can raise the pressure when you work with 311 or the Police, honestly--I think 311 more. JUST MY OPINION. Just try to get his attention or try to get somebody to get his or her attention to speak to him. Write me back if you are interested. I hope the PD comment did not offend you nor the 311 comment--I know of SO MANY people who will yell at me for making a comment about the PD or 311 that way, especially like if you are elderly or handicapped or something... Write me back and I can help you more.

					by:ANthony J Trimboli- The reason why I think that the 7 Train cars are being replaced by old train cars from the 4, for example is because they are really badly running short on money. Every time you hear about New York City Transit today, you hear about shortages of money and they can not keep up the finances. I think this is why they put old trains here to replace the 7 Train. I live out here in Howard Beach, New York and they have the most rusted old A Trains still on the route, the also put old cars from the J Train and M train on the A Train route also. The cars here on the A Train are as rusty as heck and so are some of the stations, especially if you head out to the Rockaways. Probably areas up there like by you got 7 Trains that are old 4 Trains because of New York City Transit and financial problems. But sometimes New York City Transit can have fancy things on them and their trains like this new style of lamp that goes around the 7 Train sign. You can see it on Queens Boulevard where it is like a green circle around the 7 Train sign or something??? I have no idea what it is, but it is fancy for lighting. Maybe you have seen it if you are on Queens Blvd or on Roosevelt Avenue around where you are. What a fancy sign.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, the buses out there are for that reason. Yes. I know that there are no subways around but you do have a Long Island Bus a while up if you walk to Hillside Avenue, but even that does not connect you to any buses that go around your area, I do not know of any Long Island Bus that connects with the Q60 or something like that.<br /><br />I think the planners in the area decided to make the buses that way to just get people to various interesting locations around Manhattan and Queens so they could travel without subways.<br /><br />Again, there is a Long Island Bus about a block away from there and that does connect to NYC Subways that go around where you are, I think. You have to walk to Archer Avenue.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. Lights and confusing signs can really be a confusing issue around lots of the New York City area not only Jackson Heights. I guess NYC DOT does that because they feel that Jackson Heights is a populated area and they feel that they can somehow technologically try to control traffic around the area. I think that NYC DOT personally uses too much technology at this time. I heard from many that NYC DOT is not really good or something. Some people told me this. I hate lamps that confuse. I see so many here in Queens and other boroughs to a degree. That is just NYC DOT using technology to just try to control traffic in an area. I heard NYC DOT is not really good however. Somebody told me that.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Does anybody notice how in your community and other communities of yours like Astoria like St. John&#039;s Prep is such a hard school to get to?? I live in Howard Beach and almost all the schools are easy to get to. Astoria and parking is bad, mostly bad. Astoria and traffic is worse. When I went to school at a Montessori in Elmhurst, New York, the director had all the students from the Queens location take the test for high school up at St. John&#039;s Prep. It was like the only way to get up there was by car!!!! I never saw a catholic school so hard to get to than St. John&#039;s Prep. With all the traffic and parking congestion, etc. I was a young person at that time, 12 at 1992 and I could not believe how hard it was to get there. I now am older and take trains and buses back then my parents mostly took me around and I could not believe how hard it was to get to St. John&#039;s Prep. Honestly. It was like, honestly, taking a trip to the moon or something!!!! I never saw a school so oddly placed for Queens as St. John&#039;s Prep--maybe it would be better as a school for people of Manhattan and the Bronx by the Triboro Bridge there.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I thought both diners were related, the one in Sunnyside and the one in Long Island City, New York and the one out there in SoHo, Manhattan. I was shocked at how there was one in SoHo in Manhattan. I am familiar with the one located in Long Island City on the Van Dam Street there. I could not believe that there also was one located out there in Lower Manhattan on another Van Dam Street. They are not owned by the same people though.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I got such a good laugh at how they mentioned the lights on the 7 Trains!!!!!! Yes, you sometimes drive by on Queens Blvd and you see the brilliant lights on the train. It is almost like Christmas time or something with even the red and green lights around the seven sign. I know when those trains used to be on other number lines, they did not have lights that were mechanical, they were more just like signs. I am so shocked at how you mentioned those lights on the train!!! They also put those ads for Monroe College on them and other ads!!!! Hah. I was so shocked at how you mentioned those lights!!!!!

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. Signage has been horrible in New York City, especially Manhattan. Once, I went up the Brooklyn Bridge the wrong way using an exit ramp as an entrance ramp and thank goodness a man was coming down who slowed down for me. The NYPD seemed to have not cared since they never got back to me after I made the 911 call over there on Pearl St and Ave of the Finest. I found that to be so shocking how the NYPD never got back to me about this. I found that to be very interesting.<br /><br />I think in busy areas like your area of Queens, New York, when signage is bad, you should really complain about it. When people like the NYPD did not care about my complaint over there on Pearl St and Ave of the Finest when I went up the bridge the wrong way, I was offended a little. Besides that, areas around your community, Jackson Heights, Sunnyside are busy and I think the signage should be checked in these areas. I think they should have proper signs and proper signals and things working better because the communities are busy.<br /><br />But, it was a shocker how the NYPD did not care about the time I dialed 911 when I almost went the wrong way up the Brooklyn Bridge. It just shocked me a little. Maybe these problems with signage and other things are common.... Hmmm... Has me guessing a little even in Manhattan there.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- One good part of the areas like Jackson Heights, Sunnyside, and Astoria and a little bit of Woodside is that they have everything right there for you in terms of subways and restaurants and supermarkets. I thought Jackson Heights and Astoria led the others in terms of everything being around and right there, but I think Sunnyside is not that bad also. Some neighborhoods you have here in New York City, especially Manhattan(funny enough) and even parts of Long Island and Howard Beach, New York require you to walk like fifteen miles to get to a store. Look at certain areas of Astoria, for example. Look at certain areas of Jackson Heights and even areas sort of around you like Forest Hills and Elmhurst, all is right there. You won&#039;t believe how many areas, even Manhattan and some towns out on Long Island that have absolutely positively nothing around and you have to travel like many miles to get to the location. I think this is another good element of areas like Jackson Heights and OTHERS around it. All is right there, in more ways than one, like the NYC Suwbays.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Do you know that there is another Van Dam Diner in SoHo??? When I used to volunteer at an organization on Spring St and 6 Avenue around there before currently working for a paper, there is a Van Dam Diner on Van Dam Street in SoHo, Manhattan. I am familiar with the Van Dam Diner in Long Island City and Woodside since it is sort of one of the big diners in the area like the Sage and like the Georgia. I never knew there was another Van Dam Diner in SoHo, Manhattan. They are not the same owners. I believe I asked that question and they are not the same owners. I never knew there was one in Manhattan.
