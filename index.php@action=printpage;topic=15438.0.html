				Very interesting! Thanks for posting it. I wonder about this:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District conjures images of “Rear Window,” with its charming Village courtyard peopled with composers, photographers, married couples and Miss Lonelyhearts, it’s with good reason: Production designers for that 1954 Alfred Hitchcock film reportedly visited the place before creating the grand Hollywood set where it was filmed.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Didn&#039;t Hitchcock get the idea for Rear Window when he was filming The Wrong Man in JH? I read that he stayed in one of the garden buildings during the shoot.&nbsp; <br /><br />So interesting that the little garden area in Manhattan is solely for the super-wealthy and people who moved into JH during the early years were upper middle class but not &quot;rich&quot;.&nbsp; At least we don&#039;t have to see Anna Wintour&#039;s stupid hairdo and sunglasses in JH (I have a visceral hatred of that woman).

				I didn&#039;t get the sense that the folks who owned the homes in the 1920s or 30s were super rich from that article. Sounded like much of Manhattan -- what was once where middle class people lived is now priced much too high for the middle class. The article talks about a few people living in and inheriting rent controlled apartments and people who are living homes bought by their parents and grandparents. So, sounds like a mix of of super rich and middle class. (I do wonder about the property taxes and can imagine the non-rich old guard homes being multiple family homes).

You see the kids playing in the garden there and good use being made of it. meanwhile here in JH, those garden apartments never appealed to me. most of them dont allow picnics or playing. hell some i&#039;ve heard dont even allow WALKING on the grass... how silly is that?

				There are good reasons to restrict the use of the garden. It&#039;s for all residents--not just children. And when kids are running around and screaming in the garden, guess what? It seriously diminishes the pleasure that others would like to have from sitting and reading in the garden, having a quiet walk around the garden, etc. It&#039;s a shared resource, therefore there have to be rules. For instance, playing with balls is not allowed in our garden. A few years back, a father sitting and holding his baby in the garden was hit in the head by a ball thrown by a child. It could have hit the baby. It&#039;s a liability issue--the coop could have been sued if there was a serious injury. Duh. It&#039;s not a playground. If there were an injury and a lawsuit, everyone living here might be seriously affected. I&#039;m a parent, now an empty nester, and though I agree that everyone should be allowed to walk on the grass, I also feel there should be limits on how the garden is used to help protect the interests of everyone living here and sharing the garden. We collectively spend a lot of money maintaining the beautiful plantings, etc, which are sometimes trampled and damaged by children running around unsupervised. This garden in Manhattan does not sound like it had much in the way of landscaping or plantings the way ours does. Ours is a garden, not a backyard. There&#039;s a difference. We put huge effort, money and time into making the garden beautiful and don&#039;t want to see it damaged by kids running around, climbing trees, etc, or by adults throwing barbecue parties in the common areas. <br /><br />Regarding the Hitchcock &quot;Rear Window&quot; connection--how interesting! I didn&#039;t know that Hitchcock lived here for a time. I wonder where that tidbit came from--that the production designers of Rear Window visited that particular complex in Manhattan. I&#039;d never heard of it and thought it was really fascinating. Loved the part about the neighbors cutting down the &quot;privacy hedge&quot; that Richard Gere had put up.

				&nbsp;I have had the pleasure of being in one of the houses mentioned in this article and one way it differs from our JH<br />garden apts is that everyone has a ground floor entrance to the open area as far as I could tell. This was also <br />where many people ate there meals as they look out over the garden. The big trees were gorgeous but not <br />much for plantings but a decent walk if you wanted to keep going round. A friend from the UN was in a rental <br />there and we were astonished to see how private it felt right off Houston Street!

				Eddie--we don&#039;t want to appeal to &quot;the masses,&quot; we want to protect the interests of the actual shareholders-- all of them, not just the parents and children. It&#039;s not a public park. It&#039;s private property, co-owned by all the shareholders. It&#039;s hard for me to understand why people don&#039;t understand that. If you were a shareholder in one of these garden complexes, would you really be okay with people doing whatever they wanted in the garden--throwing loud parties, barbecuing, large groups of kids playing soccer or whatever and screaming for hours right outside your windows...etc...seriously? There have to be limits, and rules. It can&#039;t be a free for all. As it stands, people here are in fact allowed on the grass, you can sit there with a blanket and have a picnic, etc, but no ball playing is allowed, no bicycles, no private parties except in the small &quot;bays&quot; that belong to each house, where the residents of that house can have parties if they like. The rules make sense. It&#039;s just silly to imagine that there should be no rules and everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want. It&#039;s unrealistic in a shared space.

I think picnics and walking on the grass is fine and a decent compromise. I was more referring to some coops that I have heard dont even allow walking on the grass or any picnics.

The riots of kids, green thumbs and flood of strollers are on decline between the village row homes and with the co-ops in JH are loosening their rules, they are on the uptick.&nbsp; Maybe even one or two shareholders over here will admit to having sat through all of &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;.<br /><br />Differences may abound, but one thing is certain:&nbsp; Lazing through a second drink, the city receding, swaddled in darkness and shuffling breezes, toes gnawing the grass, watching the fireflies dance, MacDougal Street or 84th Street, Sullivan or 76th, it&#039;s all wonderful.&nbsp; <br />

You don&#039;t get to break the rules, but you also don&#039;t get to <em>make</em> the rules for everyone. Rules can change as the attitudes of the shareholders change. Personally I&#039;m glad things are getting less oppressive. A shared <em>usable</em> space like that article describes is SO much nicer than the absurdity of grass that&#039;s just for looking at, like so many JH gardens were until recently and some still are.

				Some folks here are engaging in what&#039;s called a &quot;straw man argument.&quot; There has been no argument put forth that people should be able to do whatever they want to do: i.e. hoards of children running around in the gardens, playing with balls, turning the gardens in to soccer fields, baseball diamond, etc. <br /><br />What actually has been argued is that oppressive house rules that don&#039;t allow people to walk on grass, have picnics, etc. are not good.
