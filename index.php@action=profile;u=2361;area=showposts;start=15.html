					My guess is that many of the businesses along Roosevelt are already successful -- at least by the number of customers you see patronizing various stores/ restaurants, particularly&nbsp; on weekends.&nbsp; It is not really clear to me that these already profitable businesses would gain that much by implementing a BID, in terms of increased foot traffic, cash flow etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also, not really sure how much a BID can realistically accomplish in terms of general aesthetics. I think Roosevelt will always be a bit noisy/gritty as long as the 7 remains an elevated line -- which is likely to be for a very long time to come.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Although it’s a ways before my time, I understand that 3rd Avenue in Manhattan was very gritty up until the 1950s, when the El line was finally demolished.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And while I know this is anathema to many people on this board, Roosevelt has its own urban charms.&nbsp; For many people, the image of an elevated line rattling over a somewhat grimy but very bustling street of bars, stores and eateries is quintessentially New York. Why not just embrace that?&nbsp; <br /><br />Particularly when the rest of Jackson Heights is filled with such architecturally distinguished buildings, tree-lined and tranquil streets, lovely gardens etc. -- and is overall a very pleasant place to live.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

					To me her retaliation against the councilmember was the most chilling part of the article by far.&nbsp; I don’t really care if she yells a lot (although I think that can reflect an ineffective management style). <br /><br />But the idea that she would cut funding to community programs (presumably intended for seniors, kids etc.) in a fit of pique over a local councilmember’s conduct (and over a completely trivial dispute, at least as it is described in the article) is power politics at its worst.&nbsp; <br />

					For me, it’s an improvement over the one story taxpayer that was there before, which seemed kind of provisional and ratty looking.&nbsp; <br /><br />Granted that it’s not a distinguished or imaginative design, but it is kind of handsome and solid looking -- the uniformity with the older building across the street doesn’t bother me and I agree it fits in with the neighborhood’s look reasonably well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I actually wouldn’t mind seeing a few more five or six story brick buildings along 37 Avenue built along these lines. <br />

					Look at the language of the first couple of posts in this thread.&nbsp; It seems pretty clear to me that the driving force behind objections to the drop box, and the call to boycott and get the Councilmember involved was based on concerns over appearance, i.e. the box was too big, unsightly, out of keeping with the look of the landmark district etc.&nbsp; I think itâ€™s a bit disingenuous to claim otherwise.&nbsp; <br /><br />If USAgain is a bad outfit, they should be shut down.&nbsp; Is anyone asking Councilmember Dromm to follow-up on that front now that the nasty box is out of the way?&nbsp; <br /><br />How about replacing the US Again dropbox with a box belonging to a legitimate charitable organization, as a prior poster seemed to suggest (perhaps rhetorically)?&nbsp; Put it in the same spot as the US Again box, which seems to be centrally located and convenient for all wishing to make a donation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any problems with that?<br />

					I hope that Councilmember Dromm is not spending too much of his time responding to this kind of complaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;The serious issues which should be his focus and which hevaily impact our community of primarily moderate income and working people are: education, affordable housing, crime, hunger, poverty, homelessness, poor working conditions/low wages, exploitation of undocumented people, long term unemployment and many, many others. <br /><br />Aesthetic issues and quality of life issues are also serious and important. <br /><br />But based purely on the picture posted, I donâ€™t really get why people were quite that upset about the drop box. Itâ€™s not beautiful. But it doesnâ€™t seem particularly ugly/dirty/menacing&nbsp; either.&nbsp; It just&nbsp; looks like a big mail box painted green and white.&nbsp; &nbsp;All else being equal would prefer not to see it there, but not that big a deal.<br />

					Higher than average maintenance fees will often (though not always) reflect a larger than usual underlying mortgage.&nbsp; In most coops, I would say that debt service on the mortgage and property taxes are the two big ticket items.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note that a high underlying mortgage is not necessarily a reason not to buy -- just something to be generally aware of given that a building with a higher mortgage will have relatively less equity in the property.&nbsp; A higher underlying mortgage is also slightly riskier in the sense that if there is a maintenance default by a significant number of shareholders (or a single shareholder with multiple units, such as a sponsor) this will put a greater financial burden on the other shareholders, who will have to pick up the slack.&nbsp; <br /><br />When evaluating the building&#039;s underlying debt, you should consider this figure in the context of the number of units in the building -- for example a $2,000,000 mortgage on a building with 125 units would be a reasonable debt load.&nbsp; The same amount in a building with say 50 units would be more of a concern.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, the amount of the underlying mortgage is less of an issue now than it was back in the 90s, when property values were so much lower leaving some buildings with very little equity in the property (this was also a time when many buildings faced a real risk of sponsor default).&nbsp; <br />

					There is a branch of North Shore/LIJ in Forest Hills which my physician recommended for an emergency situation a year or so back.&nbsp; This turned out to be a positive experience -- in terms of time (a few hours total),&nbsp; quality of treatment, courtesy and kindness of staff and relatively tranquil ambience (at least for an ER). <br /><br />Easy cab ride from Jackson Heights and only a few blocks from the R train.

					Mi Tierra on Northern and 82nd is small but clean and well organized with very good fruits and vegetables (although a limited selection of other goods).&nbsp; I find this to be a very pleasant place to shop.<br /><br />A few blocks further along is what is now called&nbsp; Compare which has been through several previous incarnations but is currently a large and reasonably well-stocked store, with decent fruits and vegetables and has the added advantage of being open 24 hours.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Both of these are just a few blocks away from where I live so I canâ€™t complain.&nbsp; Also in that general area along Northern in the 80s are, among other things, Pan Fino (open 24 hours) two&nbsp; good dry cleaners, a good bagel place, Pio Pio eat in and take out, two empanada places, a decent hardware store, Dâ€™Espana, and a 24 hour Rite Aid.&nbsp; Re the latter, I know that some people on this board have a horror of proliferating drug stores (which I understand up to a point) but for me it is a huge convenience having something so basic that is always open just a couple of blocks from my apartmentâ€¦â€¦ <br /><br />On a less positive note, I have to say that C Town on 37th and 85th , which was a dreary place when I moved here, only seems to have gotten worse with the passing years but I just try to avoid itâ€¦..<br />

					For years now, there have been periodic attempts by local realtors and others to market JH as the next Park Slope, Carroll Gardens etc. -- but people who move here thinking the neighborhood is on the cusp of some transformative change will inevitably be disappointed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I moved to JH in early 1999.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the prices of coops have risen exponentially since then, there has been relatively little change in the business mix in all these years.&nbsp; So I am a little skeptical that things are likely to change all that much in the forseeable future either.&nbsp; <br /><br />In a way, it is easy to see why there has not been greater change.&nbsp; Unlike some other areas, it seems to me there is no real need for a revitalization of JH -- the neighborhood is already quite vital and successful in its own right.&nbsp; In most important ways (with a few exceptions) , JH serves its residents very well in terms of the quality and availability of basic goods and services such as groceries, pharmacies, doctors, dentists, banks, dry cleaners, hardware stores, restaurants, bars etc.&nbsp; Most of these businesses seem to do a roaring trade and are unlikely to give way to boutiques or craft shops any time soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For me that is not really a problem -- I still find JH to be a uniquely interesting and alluring neighborhood in an increasingly homogenized city.&nbsp; (Not trying to score a political point, just a matter of personal taste/aesthetics.)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

					There are a cluster of furniture stores near the Grand Avenue stop on the R train -- including the Macyâ€™s furniture center mentioned and also a large Raymour &amp; Flanigan, one other large chain (the name escapes me), as well as multiple smaller furniture stores (of variable price and quality) running along the south side of Queens Blvd.&nbsp; &nbsp;(There is also a Bobâ€™s Discount furniture in the Skyview Mall in Flushing.)

					Retail diversity in some contexts makes commercial sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in an urban environment, itâ€™s also fairly common for specialized commercial centers to develop --&nbsp; which become known for particular products/services/cuisines etc.&nbsp; ( i.e. the diamond district in midtown, the plant stores in the East 20s along 6th Ave., various antique districts, many other examples in NYC and elsewhere).&nbsp; &nbsp;In that context, having multiple competing business offering the same or similar products in a small area enhances the overall level of economic activity.&nbsp; Traditional retail diversity -- in the sense of having a florist, a hardware store, hair stylist, a dry clearner&nbsp; etc. -- is a little beside the point in a commercial center of this sort.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The 74th street corridor has plainly become an established commercial center for a number of products (directed predominately though not exclusively to the South Asian community) with seemingly dozens of jewelry shops, sari shops, food vendors and restaurants offering the same or similar products.&nbsp; My guess is that that over the years, the concentration of so many competing businesses has been a boon to the overall level of economic activity and profitability rather than a hindrance.&nbsp; So itâ€™s not really surprising that there would be two Bangladeshi supermarkets within half a block. <br /><br />Not sure what the current state of business is on 74th Street -- although by the number of people going in and out of stores it seems like it is still going strong. Could be wrong, but I kind of doubt there would be a strong business incentive to introduce more retail diversity.&nbsp; <br />

					Hitting someone in the throat -- so severely that they had to have emergency room treatment -- is assault, i.e. a felony.&nbsp; &nbsp; It really doesnâ€™t matter what the individual said or did to â€œpiss offâ€ the perpetrator.&nbsp; &nbsp;People say or do thing which really annoy me once in a while -- on the job, on the subway etc. -- but if I responded by brutally punching the person in the throat, I would be arrested.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I understand it may have been an overall difficult situation, but police officers are supposedly trained to handle difficult situations in a professional way.&nbsp; Although the idea that a judge in his sixties who happened to be passing by was somehow contributing to the â€œmayhemâ€ seems patently absurd, letâ€™s assume, arguendo, that Pioneer is right and that the judge was interfering in some way.&nbsp; &nbsp;The office could have told him to move away, yelled at him maybe -- or, in a worst case scenario, arrested him for disregarding an officerâ€™s orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />But for a police officer to just snap and punch someone as allegedly happened here shows a scary lack of self control, particularly for somenoe carrying a gun.&nbsp; The conduct of the other officers if they turned a blind eye to what happened is almost as bad.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I respect the fact that the police have a difficult job but they also have a high level of responsibility -- i.e. to enforce the law, not break it. <br /><br />I do believe (and hope) that the comments made by Pioneer are not reflective of the policy of the police department or the outlook of most officers on the street&nbsp; <br />
