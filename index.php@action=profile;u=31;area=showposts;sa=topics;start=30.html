That ended after a robbery at gunpoint years back. But the store, near 78th Street and 37th Avenue, does carry what must be one of the most eclectic mixes of china and figurines in the city, including Hummel figurines, Pickard china (the kind the White House is said to use) and the latest Vera Wang place setting.<br /><br />Max Brotman, the 83-year-old owner, sits looking out at the street, patiently waiting for the doorbell to ring when a customer arrives. All around him are stacks of boxes and shelves containing everything from Waterford crystal and plates with Norman Rockwell paintings to Lenox statuettes of Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.<br /><br />â€œI feel proud,â€ Mr. Brotman says of his customers. â€œThey come, they kiss me. Sometimes they ask me how I feel.â€<br /><br />Mr. Brotman came from Romania after World War II. His parents owned a china store there, and his brother works as a watchmaker for Tiffanyâ€™s. He says he didnâ€™t change the name of the Jackson Heights store after he bought it more than 30 years ago because the previous owner, Oscar Newman, had such a good reputation.<br /><br />In this tightly packed space where almost every surface is covered by an ornamental piece of glassware or a box of crystal waiting to be picked up, not much seems to have changed in three decades. Mr. Brotman insists that customers remove bulky shoulder bags, fearing they may accidentally knock over items on shelves along one of the narrow aisles.<br /><br />Although there is a steady stream of phone calls and packages arriving, Yilmaz Ersoy, 32, who has worked for Mr. Brotman for eight years and is his only employee, says business is tough these days.<br /><br />â€œMost of the small businesses like this are closed now,â€ he said. But, he added, Mr. Brotman still does well because â€œhe becomes like relatives with his customers.â€<br /><br />According to Mr. Ersoy, customers who know Mr. Brotman know that they donâ€™t have to unpack their order to make sure nothing is broken. They can always return an item. But both men recall one exception: A woman who opened her order 15 years after she bought it called to complain that the item was broken. Mr. Ersoy told her they couldnâ€™t replace it. â€œThe merchandise didnâ€™t even exist anymore,â€ he said.<br />

					From Queens Chronicle by YALDAZ SADAKOVA <a href="http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2008/09/11/news/top_stories/news13.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2008/09/11/news/top_stories/news13.txt</a><br /><br /><img src="http://www.queenscourier.com/content/articles/2008/09/11/news/top_stories/news13.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />Last week, Joe Galindoâ€™s efforts finally paid off. He saw a rat in the trap he had set in front of his Jackson Heights building, at 37-30 73rd Street.<br /><br />â€œIt was so heavy, you wouldnâ€™t believe it. It looked like a cat, with a long tail,â€ Galindo said, adding that the gray rat, still alive, had sores all over its body. â€œIt looked like it was infected. It was so disgusting. It was screaming like a baby.â€<br /><br />The rat died after Galindo gave it some poison, but his neighborhoodâ€™s problem did not.<br /><br />During the past year and a half, Jackson Heights has been invaded by an influx of rodents, according to residents of the neighborhood.<br /><br />â€œOn a regular basis we are getting complaints from residents,â€ said Giovanna Reid, district manager of Community Board 3, which includes Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and North Corona. â€œWe have a rodent infestation.â€<br /><br />At night, Galindo said the rats, which he noted were as big as rabbits, take over 73rd Street.<br /><br />â€œEvery other night you see them in the driveway eating food,â€ Galindo said, explaining that rats are nesting around his property and that he regularly catches them outside his residence. â€œEveryone in my building and across the street is complaining about the rats.â€<br /><br />Other people living in his building agreed that on their block, they have more rats than one would normally see on the city streets. Besides, Galindo said, on a recent morning, a neighbor who lives just down the block found a rat when she got in her car.<br /><br />â€œThis is not acceptable, this is gross and disgusting,â€ Galindo fumed.<br /><br />Apart from being disgusting, rodents such as rats are known to carry diseases that can be transmitted to humans in many ways - through animal bite, contact with animal waste, consuming food or water contaminated by rodent waste or through parasites, which use rodents and humans as hosts. Breathing in dried rodent waste that is contaminated might also lead to disease transmission.<br /><br />However, it is not just the local residents and Community Board that is taking notice of the unsightly creatures.<br /><br />â€œRodent problems are a recurring issue [in Jackson Heights],â€ said Councilmember Helen Sears, who represents the area. Like community board 3, Searsâ€™ office has been forwarding residentsâ€™ rodent-related complaints to the cityâ€™s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH).<br /><br />As a result, according to the DOHMH, since January of 2008, close to 200 pest-related inspections have been conducted within the community board. These have resulted in 50 notices of violation, meaning that pest control teams observed rodents or conditions conducive to rodent activity.<br /><br />In addition, as recently as September 5, a pest control team observed rodents and rodent-conducive conditions at two location on Galindoâ€™s block, and violation notices will be sent, according to DOHMH.<br /><br />One of the things that attract rats is garbage - the number one source of food for them. Overflowing trashcans as well as rotten produce, Styrofoam food containers and coffee cups on the ground are a common sight at night on 73rd Street and other busy stretches of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The litter on the ground usually comes from the customers of outdoor food vendors, who stay open until the wee hours of the morning or some that remain open 24-hours. In addition, the gutters on these streets are also filled with garbage.<br /><br />However, these streets are cleaned every day, but only between 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., which gives many opportunities for litter to accumulate during the night.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Reid believes another factor in the neighborhood responsible for rodent activity is the heavy construction around the area.<br /><br />â€œThe problem is widening as they [the rodents] do move,â€ Reid said, explaining that the demolition makes the rodents disperse and find new places where they can live and eat.<br /><br />

Sears (D-Queens) has a reserved parking spot directly in front of her district office. There&#039;s even a Department of Transportation sign warning drivers the spot is for &quot;Council Vehicles&quot; only during peak hours.<br /><br />While all Council members receive parking placards from the DOT that allow them to park in many restricted areas and even avoid paying the meter, four have their own private parking spots on city streets.

Join us as we celebrate the beginning of a fun, new public space in our community. <br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Also, please help us spread the word to your friends and neighbors that there is NO PARKING on 78th Street between Northern Blvd and 34th Avenue from 6am-8pm on Sundays from July 13th through Nov 16th.</span><br /><br /><strong>Programming this Sunday</strong><br />10am-1pm &quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike Workshop&quot;.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child.html</a><br /><em>Free but pre-registration is encouraged so we know how many children to expect. Follow the above link to pre-register.</em><br /><br />---<br /><br /><strong>Why a play street?</strong><br /><br />The idea is simple: 78th Street, between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue, will be closed to motor vehicle traffic on Sundays to allow for games, free play, performances, markets, and other activities to take place in the car-free street.<br /><br />78th Street is right next to Travers Park, our small neighborhood park. With thousands of residents around it, Travers Park is very crowded on weekends, and often there is not enough space for everyone to enjoy the park. The Play Street will make it possible for park activities to spill into the street, allowing people to stroll, play, attend events and relax in the space, while reducing crowding in the park.<br /><br />The Play Street will also be a space for the Greenmarket that is currently located on 34th Avenue to expand, adding more vendors, and making it more comfortable for shoppers.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the highest densities of children per acre of green space and is the city district with the second-to-last amount of green space in the entire city. We need more park space, and the Play Street is a small practical step in our search to expand and improve neighborhood open space.

					<strong><br />&quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike&quot; Workshop<br />Sunday, July 13th 10am-1pm<br />78th St between 34th Avenue &amp; Northern Blvd<br /></strong><br />Bike New York will host a &quot;Teaching Your Child to Ride a Bike&quot; Workshop in Jackson Heights on July 13th. This event will mark the official opening of the 78th Street Play Street which is an initiative to create a car-free recreation area for children on 78th Street between Northern Blvd and 34th Avenue on Sundays from July 13th through November 16th. This initiative was the result of the hard work of community partners JHGreen, Friends of Travers Park/JHBG, and the Western Jackson Heights Alliance. <br /><br />The workshop teaches a safe, easy, effective way for parents to help get their children rolling--a method in which the child does most of the work! Participants learn the basics of balancing, starting, stopping, and steering a bike. Children may learn to ride their bike while taking the class, but even if they don&#039;t, parents will leave with an easy, hands-free, crash-free, and low-stress way to teach their child to ride. <br /><br />All cyclists must wear a helmet and have a bicycle that fits. The child must be able to rest his or her feet flat on the ground while sitting on the bicycle seat. The program works best for children ages 5 and up. <br /><strong><br />Participation is free, but pre-registration is required.</strong> Please register at: <a href="http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child_application.php4" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bikenewyork.org/education/classes/teach_child_application.php4</a><br />

					There is some discussion of a cell phone tower antenna going up on a building on 88th Street between 35th &amp; 37th Avenues. <br /><strong>What&#039;s the deal with cell phone towers? </strong><br />Are they a good or a bad thing? <br />I&#039;m interested to read what people have learned about this.

They write the ticket anyway.&quot; <br /><br />The situation is not much better in midtown Manhattan. <br /><br />Traffic agents and officers from the Midtown South precinct have so far handed out 17,879 tickets, compared with the 5,458 tickets issued by 7th Precinct officers on the lower East Side. <br /><br />Mark Rodriguez, 31, who manages Tasty Catering, a restaurant on Madison Ave. near 31st St., said he received three tickets last week, two in a day. <br /><br />&quot;They literally wait in front of the car, so if it&#039;s 1:59 and the receipt says 2, [the cop] gives me the ticket one second after 2,&quot; he added. &quot;It&#039;s a disaster.&quot; <br /><br />Despite the burden on some neighborhoods, the total number of tickets written in the city this year, 672,149, is down 13% compared with last year. <br /><br />But the numbers could start to rise. Another 200 traffic agents started work last week.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:rschapiro@nydailynews.com" class="bbc_email">rschapiro@nydailynews.com</a><br /><br />

					The recent Presidential primary in New York attracted a large number of voters to the polls in Jackson Heights. However, some people were turned away at the polls because they were not registered in a party that was holding a primary.&nbsp; Or they were not registered in a party in time to participate in their parties&#039; primary.&nbsp; For instance, if you register as &#039;no party&#039; in New York -- you can not participate in the primary election. If you wanted to vote for Clinton or Obama, you had to be&nbsp; registered in the Democratic party. The same rules hold true for the Republican party. In the general election, you can vote for anyone regardless of party affiliation.<br /><br />I bring this up because I recently learned of a surprising quirk in New York City law that does not allow someone to change parties AND vote in the new party for one calendar year. For example, if you recently moved to Jackson Heights and decided to register as &#039;no party&#039;. But you later realize that most of the elected officials are decided in the Democratic primaries and you want to participate in the Democratic primary.&nbsp; So, say on March 1st, you go and change your registration. It will not be valid for one whole year. You will not be able to participate in a Democratic primary until after March 1st, 2009. <br /><br />I think this is important for all voters to understand. If they are hoping to participate in the Democratic or Republican primaries for nearly all local elective offices, now is the time to change your registration. You will have to register in a party before Sept 2008 to vote in the next Mayoral and City Council primary races. <br /><br />For more information go to the New York City Board of Elections <a href="http://vote.nyc.ny.us/register.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://vote.nyc.ny.us/register.html</a>:<br /><br /><strong>Party Affiliation and the Primary System</strong><br />In a Primary Election, only voters registered with one of the parties qualified to hold a primary in New York City may vote to nominate their party&#039;s candidate to run in the general election.<br /><br />Candidates nominated by the parties for each office then appear on the general election ballot, along with any independent candidates who gain access to the general ballot without running in the party primaries.<br /><br /><strong>Voting in Primary Elections</strong><br />Because a primary is strictly a party election, only voters registered with one of the parties conducting a primary may participate in that party&#039;s election. Voters registered without party affiliation may vote only in General and Special Elections.<br /><br /><strong>To Change Your Party Affiliation</strong><br />You can change your party affiliation by obtaining a Voter Registration Form, indicating the change and sending it to the Board of Elections. We will process the information and send you a new voter card reflecting the change in party. <span class="bbc_u">You cannot CHANGE your enrollment and vote in the NEW PARTY of your choice in the same year.</span> Please Note: a change of enrollment will go into affect one week following the General Election. The last day to change your enrollment is the same as the last day to register for the General Election (25 days prior to the date of the General Election).
