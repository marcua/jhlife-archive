					Super happy to hear this but wow..that dumpster needs to be switched out pronto! It has been overflowing for many days. Decaying fruit has fallen onto the street and is sitting on the storm drain since the weekend at least. And now switching it out has become more complicated since they are closing off 77th st from 7-8a to 7pm for construction on 35th ave. <br /><br />Anyone know how to get some action on this? I peeked under the open gate over the weekend but saw no one inside.

					I use and recommend dijifi. <br /><br />Whomever you go with, I would not recommend you transfer to DVD. That is a dying (some say already dead) medium. You don&#039;t want to go through this all again in 4-5 years. <br /><br />Do you have a computer? If so you are better off spending the money to have these transferred as a HD film transfer file and saved to a USB thumb drive or hard drive. Then you can play the files through a quicktime player and easily add to youtube to share with family and friends if you wish. <br /><br />Feel free to DM me if you have any questions. I have a good deal of experience with this type of work.

					While I agree with you dssjh &amp; abcdefghijk 100% about the east river parks appeal, maybe the &quot;active play&quot; part of our park like basketball, volleyball, handball, kickball, tennis, hopscotch etc could have abutted the noisier Northern blvd?

					Has there been a picture painted about what kind of development will likely come to Northern Blvd? Residential? Commercial? Mixed use? Hotels?<br /><br />I still think it&#039;s a shame the city couldn&#039;t have purchased that parcel on Northern closest to Travers park where a car dealership is currently renovating. It would have been a nice idea to enlarge our only park. I guess they spent all their money on that Brooklyn waterfront park Bloomberg promised but forgot to actually buy the land to complete: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/nyregion/new-york-buys-last-tract-for-williamsburg-waterfront-park-for-160-million.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/nyregion/new-york-buys-last-tract-for-williamsburg-waterfront-park-for-160-million.html</a>

					<em>“It’s probably the most prominent building in the Jackson Heights market,” said John Petras, a partner at RockFarmer.</em><br /><br />LOL. Um and perhaps the most unattractive? I&#039;ve never been inside this building. Could it be converted to condos or does the zoning not work for that?<br /><br />Or could it become a hotel? Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but it looks like it falls in line with the zoning map posted in the other thread about Sterling bank: <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/m1-hotel-text/qn03.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans-studies/m1-hotel-text/qn03.pdf</a><br />

					My husband sent me this update he spotted on QueensNeighborhoodsUnited&#039;s FB page from July 13th. Looks like they are going for a 10 story structure..which isn&#039;t that still taller than the 9 stories allowed?&nbsp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/QueensNeighborhoodsUnited/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/QueensNeighborhoodsUnited/</a><br /><br />&quot;BREAKING NEWS: MILLIONAIRE DEVELOPERS WITHDRAW APPLICATION TO BUILD HIGHER ON 82ND ST!<br /><br />Following extensive community opposition, the developers have WITHDRAWN their application to rezone 40-31 82nd Street. This is a HUGE victory for our community! After more than a year of organizing - in which the community pressured our elected officials and the developers - Sun Equity Partners and Heskel Group announced to the press that they will formally withdraw the application to rezone the site on Monday, 7/16.<br /><br />We will not forget: Despite serious concerns raised by the community, multiple City Planning Commissioners, and Queens Community Board 4 (which voted overwhelmingly against the spot rezoning in March), Council Member Francisco Moya has been a vocal supporter of the rezoning since early May. CM Moya has made closed doors deals with the developers for more so-called “affordable” units in the project and he along with Queens Borough President Melinda Katz have accepted thousands of dollars from the developers.<br /><br />If there is anything we have learned from this campaign, it is that we must relentlessly hold our elected officials accountable - it took almost half a year of organizing to pressure CM Moya to withdraw support from the rezoning.<br /><br />OUR FIGHT IS NOT OVER. The developers have proposed a 10-story building instead of the rezoning, and it is still not for our community. We will continue to fight alongside our neighbors to create spaces that meet our community’s real needs: 100 percent neighborhood affordable housing, support for our immigrant-run small businesses (NOT corporate chains), community space and schools for the next generation.&quot;

					I wonder, has it been mentioned on this site about the recent sale for the corner building at 74-12 37th ave (Corner of 75th and 37th ave that currently houses Mejbaan) for $16 million? I heard this while I was on a Jane&#039;s Walk. It sounds like we may need to ready ourselves for another spot rezoning situation there?<br />Sale info here: <a href="https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/top-5-retail-space-sales-8/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/top-5-retail-space-sales-8/</a><br /><br />I am also confused about this proposed expansion of the historic district. Couldn&#039;t this be wildly unfair to a large swath of those who own smaller homes and buildings? I get that there could be an upswing in the value of certain buildings. But won&#039;t many of those who own in the newly added area also have huge financial responsibilities when it comes time to make repairs to their exterior structures? Won&#039;t things like replacing windows and roofs all need to have Landmark&#039;s approval, requiring they be done in historic context? Or am I missing something?

					Hello all,<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d share the news that the Foodtown has really mixed up their offerings as of late. They have converted a chunk of their produce section to offer more prepared foods. I admit I haven&#039;t given it a very close look.<br /><br />Also they added a refrigerated case on the right just as you enter the store which features cheeses. For their first go it&#039;s a bit of a mix bag of options. They have quite a few cheeses with truffles and prices to match that delicacy status. They also have an old standby like Saint Andre triple cream brie which was priced higher than I remember seeing it elsewhere (but it&#039;s been a while since I last bought this). What really surprised me was they even offer two cheeses from the California artisan organic cheese purveyor Cowgirl Creamery, which they priced comparably to Whole Foods.<br /><br />I know some people in this area are clamoring for new local options. I give foodtown credit for trying something new and attempting to respond to the changing tastes of this area. Check &#039;em out and maybe ask for more of the cheeses you&#039;d like to see?

					I just wanted to add a little more about the Big belly compactors. We do not want these things. I lived in an area that was selected for the pilot program. I quickly came to refer to these monstrosities as the Big Belly Boondoggle. Trash overflowed from them every single day, especially on the most congested blocks on our main business strip.<br /><br />I spoke to a DOS guy who was writing the field report on these for the city. He said they broke down a lot. He mentioned a serious reoccurring problem was jamming, siting the example of people throwing things like broken umbrellas etc. This required repairs in order for the thing to compress the trash. He said the capacity was only significantly better when it could compacted the trash inside. If it jammed it had roughly the same capacity as a &quot;dumb&quot; can. Plus that meant the city could not schedule fewer trash pick ups..which I believe he said was an idea to offset the start up cost.<br /><br />Another issue he identified was &quot;the push back on touching the handle&quot; which was required to throw something away. Just think for a second how disgusting that thing is. You&#039;d like to touch that? They even went so far as to retrofit a BB compactor with a step pedal opening. So after spending what..3K/can the city also needs to retrofit these just to get people to use them? <br /><br />My favorite saying came from a neighbor &quot;These things are an answer to a question nobody asked.&quot;&nbsp; So true. Sorry Alfster but this is not a nice thing for Jackson Heights...or anywhere really. I hope there&#039;s no campaign underway to get this scam into our area.

					Hello Linden Court residents of the buildings at 37-34 85th st and 37-40 85th st,<br /><br />I was curious if I can connect via PM with anyone that worked on the sourcing of new windows during your recent restoration projects.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested to learn more about the following: <br /><br />-Which Pella window dealer you worked with?<br />-Which window series you selected? Wood or vinyl?<br />-Is the green tint of the glass indicative of light or noise control? Or both?<br />-Were these windows intended to address sound reduction?<br />-If sound abatement was a goal which method did you choose? IE laminated glass, triple pane glass, double pane and gas fill, etc?<br />-Was it effective for sound reduction? If so can you approximately by what percentage?<br /><br />Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Thank you,<br />BEB<br />

					Hey NYC Peromyscus,<br /><br />I exited the 7 train on the Citifield side and yes a gate was open. It is located on the outer perimeter of the stadium. Exiting to the right after leaving the 7 station and heading around to the back should get you there quicker. (We took the long way around by heading left.) <br /><br />Those prices I referenced were printed on a formal menu. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d change pricing for game day since their system is all computerized. It is likely they could charge more for some of these special &quot;guest&quot; brews however.&nbsp; BTW they mentioned they&#039;d now be selling a few Mikkeller can types inside the stadium on game days...so I&#039;d guess those would get the premium pricing. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />PS They are open today and tomorrow too to get their operations running smoothly before Mets opening day. They said that won&#039;t be a common occurrence once the season gets underway. I hope you enjoy it!<br />
