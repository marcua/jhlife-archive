					<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">If you haven&#039;t seen Jackson Heights&#039; newest garden, take a walk by the Post Office on 37th Avenue. (See attached photo.) It looks pretty good now and will be looking great starting in a few weeks when the blooms start. <br />Last fall we had more than two dozen shrubs planted along the rear of the PO&#039;s two garden sections; on Friday past we had 102 perennials, many of them natives planted. Many attract beneficial insects. That includes 10 flowering milkweeds, the essential plant for Monarch butterflies. It&#039;s the only plant on which they lay their eggs. Among the other natives, black-eye Susans and Echinacea.<br />JHBG has been working on this garden for more than two years: obtaining the funding, getting Post Office permission and many other steps that you never envision when you first start a project. <br />It&#039;s all part of one of JHBG&#039;S key callings: environmental sustainability, as in bringing Mother Nature back to the City.<br />On a related point, you may have already noticed that our Curbside Tree Gardens along 37th Avenue from 74th Street to 87th Street (as well as a stretch of 75th Street.) are looking colorful. While the Post Office was planted by a contractor because it was such a big project, we rely on Tree LC volunteers for the tree gardens. So please think about getting involved. Our next tree garden session is this SUNDAY, 10 a.m. We meet at 37th Ave and 80th Street. Get involved in your community. You might find you love it.&nbsp; </span><br />

					<strong>We will tell you how you can help tame this threat, but first the details.</strong><br /><br />It&#039;s no secret that high-rises well above the six-stories that&#039;s been the max in Jackson Heights will be rising here. At least five buildings that would break though that ceiling are proposed, approved or under construction - including two 13-story buildings - a photo of one we&#039;ve attached here. The Jackson Heights Beautification Group (JHBG) the Queensboro Houses Association and others included at least one elected official are pushing city government act on our seven-year-old application to expand the existing landmark district before it is too late. <br /><br />First, let&#039;s get one thing out of the way.&nbsp; We are not trying to freeze all development or prevent new housing from being built. We will explain later,&nbsp; but back to the threat.<br /><br />We&#039;ve already seen massive development in Long Island City and part of Astoria, as well as Flushing and other parts of Queens, now it appears to be JH&#039;s turn. <strong>Several months ago a developer bought two, two-story brick buildings on 89th Street off 37th Avenue and filed plans to put up a nine-story building there. This should SCARE you if like JH&#039;s planned mix of smaller buildings with apartment buildings because this is the first time developers bought multi-family buildings in Jackson Heights in order to tear them down to put up much bigger structures.</strong> <br /><br />Think about this: these will not contain so-called affordable apartments (even those not affordable for most local renters,) but they will burden our local infrastructure: our already crowded transit system, parks, schools and streets.<br /><br />As we said above landmarking does not halt development, witness the six-story building that went up on 37th Avenue near 84th Street a few years back or &quot;Kelly&#039;s Manor,&quot; a five-story building to replace a one-story structure already approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. <br /><br />What land DOES do is it requires new buildings to fit in with the character of our neighborhood. The fact is<br />the buildings and their gardens outside the historic district are of the same high quality of the buildings designated as an historic district in 1993.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>How you can help:</strong><br />Remember, complaining about how bad this is on this or other site won&#039;t help.<br />Instead, contact Landmarks Preservation Commission Executive Director, Sarah Carroll.<br />1. Place &quot;Expand the Jackson Heights Historic District&quot; in subject line or atop your letter. <br />2. Tell her know why the landmark extension is important to you. USE YOUR OWN WORDS, but you may want to cover some of these ideas: <br />* The buildings in the proposed district extension are just as worthy as those within the existing district. <br />* Jackson Heights&#039; architecture and building gardens create a distinctive and beautiful community appreciated by NYC’s most diverse population.<br />You can email her at: <a href="mailto:scarroll@lpc.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">scarroll@lpc.nyc.gov</a><br /><br />and please copy us at <a href="mailto:expandJHdistrict@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">expandJHdistrict@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Or write her at: <br />NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission Executive Director Sarah Carroll.<br />The Municipal Building<br />1 Centre Street, 9th Floor North<br />New York, NY 10007<br /><br />

					<strong>Jackson Heights curbside tree gardens are blooming. Help us keep them blooming all spring, summer and fall!<br /><br />Saturday April 28, 10 a.m., <br />Meet SE corner of 80th Street and 37th Avenue <br />We are out most weekends, mostly Saturdays, some Sundays. See JHBG&#039;s FB page for details or contact me at <a href="mailto:LenManiace@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">LenManiace@gmail.com</a> to be put on our email list for updates </strong><br /><br />JHBG&#039;s Tree LC volunteers turn these plots into botanical jewels, bursting with color and providing mini-habitats for butterflies, bees and other beneficial insects. They also part of a citywide strategy to collect runoff, preventing sewage treatment plants from being overloaded during rains and then dumping waste into local waterways. We are working on 45 curbside gardens, almost all on 37th Avenue from 74th Street to 87th Street, and few on 75th Street near the subway. <br /><br />Tree gardens also significantly reduce temperatures lessening the need for air conditioning, cutting electricity usage and emissions of global warming carbon dioxide. <br /><br />It&#039;s beautify with a higher purpose. So join us.&nbsp; We&#039;ll be out again the next week, Saturday, May 5, at 10 a.m.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tree LC is one of two JHBG greening programs. Why two? We’ve got a lot to green in JH.

					<strong>Is this good or bad for Jackson Heights? You decide.</strong><br /><br />Permits have been filed for a nine-story mixed-use building at 37-32 89th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens. The site is two blocks away from the 90th Street Elmhurst Avenue Subway Station, serviced by the 7 train. The building will sit within one of two major commercial areas in the neighborhood, and Fuzhou Development will be responsible for the project.<br /><br />The 80-foot tall structure will yield 27,250 square feet of space, with 17,200 square feet dedicated to residential use, and 3,650 square feet for a non-specific community facility on the ground floor. There will be seven parking spaces available. 24 apartments will be created, averaging 1,140 square feet apiece, indicating condominiums.<br />Ling Li Architect Associates will be responsible for the design. Demolition permits were filed for the existing two-story structure in late November. The estimated completion date has not been announced.<br /><br /><a href="https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/01/permits-filed-for-37-32-89th-street-jackson-heights-queens.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/01/permits-filed-for-37-32-89th-street-jackson-heights-queens.html</a><br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>JHBG is looking to expand the historic district, providing some protection against this.

GT is a national observance to encourage us to give to charities and volunteer organizations that make our lives better. We hope you will consider a gift to JHBG, the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. Here is a link to our website: <a href="http://www.jhbg.org/donate" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhbg.org/donate</a></span><br />You know us. We’re the folks who bring you the Halloween Parade, the Christmas-Hanukkah festivities at the Post Office, the Jackson Heights Orchestra and Summer Sundays in the Parks; we run the JH Scraps compost center, advocate for parks/open space and programs that green the neighborhood and make it more environmentally sustainable; we remove graffiti, provide a park to walk your pooch, support our landmark district, run an annual children’s art contest, provide info on local schools, and produce this newsletter. Whew! And we do this with volunteers.<br />But just because we are volunteers, doesn’t mean the programs we run are without cost. <br />Donations are often matched by employers so check on the policy at your workplace.<br />Through all of these programs, we think we make Jackson Heights a friendlier neighborhood, a place where it’s not unusual to run into friends while picking up groceries or heading to the subway for work – in short, a small town in the big city.
