The original politics behind this parade involved the exclusion of gays in the Manhattan parade but it has <br />now come be a home for many other issues. Phil Donahue is an Honoree this year along with the Anastasia Somoza the human<br />rights advocate you may have seen at the DNC convention. <strong>The speakers start at 1:00 at 43rd Street and Skillman Ave <br />in Sunnyside. Actual parade starts moving at&nbsp; 2:00pm.</strong> The parade route is relatively short and you are welcome to join<br />in or step out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;Come celebrate all that we have achieved positively in celebrating diversity and inclusion in contemporary Ireland and here <br />in the US!

					&nbsp;Since the weather is fairly good today but looks cold and icy for the weekend, anyone who needs work and can shovel<br />snow can get registered here with the Dept of Sanitation as a snow laborer. The starting hourly wage is $15.per hour-<br />jumps to $22.50 hr after working a 40hr work week in one week. You need to be 18 yrs old with id. <br /><br /><strong>Register Now to Help Clear Snow and Ice After Major Winter Storms</strong><br /><br />The New York City Department of Sanitation has announced that starting today, individuals interested in working as an emergency snow laborer for the upcoming snow season may now register at their local Sanitation garage. Snow laborers are per-diem workers who shovel snow and ice from bus stops, crosswalks, fire hydrants and step streets in the City after heavy snowfalls.<br /><br />Individuals interested in registering with the DSNY can do so weekdays between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. The list of garage locations can be found at <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/sanitation" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.nyc.gov/sanitation</a>. Snow laborers will be paid $15 per hour, and $22.50 per hour after 40 hours are worked in a week, an increase from the previous year.<br /><br />“While the uniformed men and women of the Department of Sanitation concentrate their efforts on driving snow plows and salt spreaders to keep city streets accessible, Emergency Snow Laborers work in areas important to pedestrians to help keep the city moving,” said Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia. “Snow laborers work to clear the city’s crosswalks, fire hydrants, step streets and bus stops, and allow for the quicker removal of snow and ice in these areas.”<br /><br />Snow laborers must be at least 18 years of age, be eligible to work in the United States, and capable of performing heavy physical labor.<br /><br />All applicants must bring the following items at the time of registration:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ---Two small photos (1 ½ square)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ---Original and copy of two forms of identification<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ---Social Security card<br /><br />Individuals may also register at select Department of Transportation locations. The offices will be open Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. and require the same photographs and identification.<br /><br />In Queens:<br />Kew Loop Yard , 78-88 Park Drive East, Queens, NY (in Kew Gardens)<br /><br />Harper Street Yard, 32-11 Harper Street, Queens, NY ( in Corona just past the Marina area)<br /><br />

					&nbsp;The commercialization of Halloween is a sad thing to watch but the one aspect that I find most depressing is all<br />the unimaginative store bought costumes. So, so many same-same costumes. Are we branding our kids to be in<br />uniform every day of the year and having to look like everyone else even on this holiday which used to celebrate<br />creativity and free expression? That said at the wonderful JHBG Halloween parade, the adult costumes in recent <br />years have been whimsical, witty and so fun. Why not the kids?

					NYC Parks has fliers out announcing a community meeting to discuss the share of $40Million! that has been set aside for<br />the redesign of its entrances, edges and underused spaces. They are &quot;a new design approach&quot;. Hope that some folks from<br />Jackson Heights are able to make this meeting (from 6:30-8:00pm) to share their thoughts on us as a satellite neighborhood.<br />Spanish and Chinese translators available. This is for Flushing Meadows/Corona Park<br /><br />also- it says that if you can&#039;t make the meeting you can share your thoughts online at nyc.gov/parks/pwb for 2 wks after <br />the meeting.

					&nbsp; Summer Sundays in the Parks, the long running concert series by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, is holding<br />two concerts today- yes, two! First is the NYC mobile puppet van with &quot;Puss and Boots&quot;. These are so fun and we hope<br />that all the kids can bring their families. Seating in front for the really little ones. At 2:30 in Travers Park.<br /><br />&nbsp;And then our perennial favorite, the political theater of The Theater for the New City. This is great live community performance<br />and in this crazy election cycle you know there will be laughs. Start time is 4:00. So come on down for this super NYC theater<br />troupe&#039;s visit to Jackson Heights. Show them your pulse!<br /><br />&nbsp;

					&nbsp;Police are using the 34th Ave bike lanes to ensnare riders. Twice in 3 days I have witnessed unreasonable tickets supposedly<br />for running red lights- other eyewitnesses agree- and it feels predatory. First time, the officers drove like a bat out of hell with<br />sirens on and we think they are going to an emergency. Then a young hispanic biker goes to put his foot down to stop and they<br />cut him off and say he ran a light the street before. Not true! We saw it. So a $50. ticket for him. Then another officer today<br />in an unmarked car stops another biker saying the same thing at the same place! Did the word go out that you can trap bikers<br />in this area? <br /><br />&nbsp;This is exactly the kind of thing we don&#039;t need in a summer of violence. Please stop ticketing bike riders for non-offenses! I<br />am all for enforcement of traffic laws but when we have a free-for-all on 37th ave of 3 pt turns and double parking and endless<br />honking on 73rd and 37th, this seems like really MISPLACED POLICING.<br /><br />&nbsp;To the 115th- STOP TICKETING THE BIKERS FOR RED LIGHTS WHEN YOU ARE IGNORING VEHICULAR VIOLATIONS THAT ARE<br />&nbsp;A COMMUNITY THREAT. WE DON&#039;T NEED THIS!
