				Thanks to Restaurant Week I made my first visit to La Fusta last night.&nbsp; The $20 special included a salad, a beef empanada, half a skirt steak, flan and a glass of wine.&nbsp; Service, food and ambiance were excellent.&nbsp; The full menu looked inviting so I&#039;ll be back. Three days left for more discoveries!&nbsp; This was a great idea, and like other Restaurant Weeks around the City it ought to be held twice a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;:coolsmiley:

				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />We&#039;re very happy to see all the discussion about restaurant week, good to know it&#039;s out there and people are taking advantage of it. <br /><br />This is the first year and probably first ever restaurant week in Jackson Heights! It has been a challenging yet rewarding experience to put together and we have learned A LOT ! Which will only make next year&#039;s even better ! Some of the restaurants were very reluctant to offer a discount beyond the ones they already do. Others apparently didn&#039;t quite get the concept. Our hope is after having a positive experience this year, restaurants next year will be more willing to offer even better deals. <br /><br />In the case of La Fusta, as far as we know they are participating in restaurant week. We will reach out to them today to clarify what appears to have been a misunderstanding. <br /><br />We welcome any and all thoughts and ideas on how to make next year&#039;s restaurant week better. We also welcome volunteers to help us reach out to even more restaurants so we can really show the diversity of what JH has to offer ! <br /><br />Thanks for all your comments so far, and enjoy the rest of June in Jackson Heights !

				Just5 an update, we spoke with the folks at La Fusta and they told us that the waiter did indeed make a mistake the other night. They are participating in Restaurant Week and look forward to more people visiting them !
