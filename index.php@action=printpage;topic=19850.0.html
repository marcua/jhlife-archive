There was never an instruction that only at-risk people are supposed to stay home. In addition, even if someone is healthy, they may live with others who are more vulnerable and the healthy person can&#039;t take the risk of bringing the virus home to their household.<br /><br />There is a COVID Care Neighbor Network that is set up specifically for the most vulnerable to be able to get groceries and deliveries, so people who are at-risk can use that. And the rest of us can (and should!) use the other delivery services, since we are not eligible to use services that are designated for elderly/vulnerable. If you don&#039;t know about this service, please see this post elsewhere on Jackson Heights Life: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19778.msg98489#msg98489 (also pasted below)<br /><br />There is help available for those who can&#039;t go out.<br /><br />&quot;Dear Neighbor,<br />I just wanted to tell you about the COVID Care Neighbor Network. <br />We are matching neighbors to help other neighbors during this difficult time. <br />We are here to help. <br />To sign up to get help call Nuala at 646-210-4495 or fill out this form online. https://forms.gle/7owo7H6uBsSuNT3p6<br /><br />We have partnered with Together We Can and now can accept donations at https://togetherwecanrc.org/donate/<br /><br />We will get through this by working together.<br />Nuala<br />646-210-4495&quot;

				I don&#039;t think it makes sense to shame anyone for ordering groceries.<br /><br />But anyone with an upcoming delivery could consider sharing the delivery with a neighbor.

				&nbsp;I agree. Leave some slots for the elders for the reasons stated above. They can&#039;t get out, but you can even if there is some degree of risk involved. Their risk is HUGE! Maybe the companies could set aside a percentage for older or high risk folks first, then parents of small kids and down the line. Most people I know in quarantine are enjoying a calculated food shop to get the h. out of the house! Between those shops and the excellent takeout on occasion, we are doing just fine under covid-19 thanks god.

				^yes, people who have been exposed and need to self isolate (along with their families) can&#039;t get food delivery. People who are infected and at home -- which is most of the sick people because you&#039;re only supposed to go to a healthcare facility if your symptoms get bad -- can&#039;t get delivery.<br /><br />Gee, what&#039;s the worst possible outcome of that?

				Here&#039;s a suggestion, why not flag down one of the kids aimlessly skateboarding down the streets and ask them to go to the store for you? They&#039;re not at risk and maybe would like some spending cash? Some young person could develop their own instacart type business if they had any initiative.

				^Well, first that&#039;s not social distancing. the advice is that anyone over the age of 70 shouldn&#039;t leave their home, so no.&nbsp; Also, if you have been exposed to Covid or are experiencing symptoms, you shouldn&#039;t really be flagging people down. Plus, those kids aimlessly roaming the streets could be asymptomatic carriers or presymptomatic.<br /><br />I hope you&#039;re joking.<br /><br />I know people who are elderly and can&#039;t get grocery delivery. I know people who are experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 who can&#039;t get grocery delivery.&nbsp;

				I like how we know these kids are aimlessly skateboarding, rather than actually going somewhere. I suspect also these &quot;kids&quot; are young adults. Bikes are acceptable means of transportation and exercise. Skateboards are not.
