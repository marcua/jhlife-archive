				<strong>Heightening Stories offers a new round of creative writing workshops, starting this January:</strong> Details below.&nbsp; Visit nancyagabian.com (http://nancyagabian.com) or email nancyagabian@yahoo.com for additional info.<br /><br /><strong>Creative Nonfiction/Autobiographical Fiction</strong><br />10 Wednesday nights, 6:30 – 9:30 pm<br />Jan 22 – Apr 2 <br />in Jackson Heights, Queens<br />Limited to 8 members<br />$400<br /><br />This ongoing community-oriented group encourages members to write stories that are both bravely personal and socially conscious.&nbsp; Held in a supportive environment in the instructor&#039;s home, the weekly sessions will include discussions of exemplary contemporary fiction and nonfiction, craft exercises to help you develop material and learn writing techniques, and constructive group feedback sessions.&nbsp; Content and lesson topics are adjusted to the needs of each group and have included writing on race, class, gender, &amp; sexuality and their intersections; cross cultural &amp; queer experiences; the immigrant experience; and health, wellness and the body.&nbsp; By the end of the twelve weeks, you will have completed or revised up to twenty pages of writing (one long piece or a few short essays, stories or chapters) that will be ready to publish.&nbsp; You can also choose to read an excerpt at a group reading on April 9.<br /><br /><strong>To apply:</strong> please email nancyagabian@yahoo.com two paragraphs that 1) explain your interest and/or experience in contributing to a writing community (i.e., why would you be a successful member of this writing group?) and 2) describe your writing goals and/or the writing you would like to do with this group. Attach a 1-3 page sample of writing. <strong>Application deadline: Saturday, January 18</strong><br /><br /><strong>Community Writing Exercise Studio</strong><br />Saturday 10:00 am – 12:00 pm<br />February 1: on immigration, place, and homeland<br />March 15: on family, ancestry and history<br />April 5: on intersections of identity: race, class, gender and/or sexuality<br />Drop in on any session<br />Sliding scale: $5 - $25/session.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Community Writing Exercise Studio is geared for all writers, from beginning to advanced, to flex their creativity and to explore issues of place, community and identity. We&#039;ll do two to three different writing exercises: one based on a short creative text, the other on an interactive visual, musical, conversational or storytelling prompt, and the third option based on the collaborative work and requests of the group. We&#039;ll also allot time for you to read the results of the exercises (if you so choose) in order to receive supportive responses from the group.&nbsp; The Studio can give you an introduction to creative writing, a means to experiment creatively, an entry into a project and/or a means to share your writing in community.<br /><strong><br />To register for your first session</strong>, please email nancyagabian@yahoo.com (at least 48 hours in advance) and 1) describe your experience with writing 2) your interest in the topic of the session and 3) the rate you can afford to pay.<br /><br /><strong>About Nancy:</strong> I have twenty years experience teaching writing in community and college settings.
