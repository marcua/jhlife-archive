					From Sen. Jose Peralta: Park enforcement officers should treat everyone respectfully, but according to the images in this video, this seems not to be the case. I am told that this particular woman was coming to the aid of her mother, a street vendor who apparently didn&#039;t have the proper permits, but that is no reason for the authorities to treat this particular New Yorker without the courtesy she deserves. We are sending a letter to Parks asking them to investigate this case. Just to clarify, the 110th Police Precinct was not involved in the incident.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp7oYUV8jrY&amp;feature=share" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp7oYUV8jrY&amp;feature=share</a>

					Statement from Senator Jose Peralta regarding the approval of the State&#039;s budget: <br /><br />While this budget is not perfect, and no budget is, this is a plan that we can be proud of. I am pleased to announce that my colleagues and I in Independent Democratic Conference were able to secure $10 million in funding for immigration legal defense services, in a groundbreaking and coordinated effort to fight President Trump’s attacks on our vibrant communities. So too, I am glad that we are finally acting to Raise The Age of criminal responsibility in New York State for children ages 16 and 17; everyone deserves a second chance and fair shot at reaching a bright future. Additionally, I am proud to report that we secured a historic increase in overall school aid of about $1 billion, which includes a $700 million increase in foundation aid to public schools, bringing the annual appropriation for foundation aid to approximately $1.1 billion dollars. Assuming that these funds are allocated proportionally by the City of New York, my District would receive approximately $18.3 million for our public schools. Without adequately funded public schools, schoolchildren across the City are placed at a severe disadvantage. Again, while this budget accomplishes a great deal of good, there are several issues that remain on the table. As the legislative session continues, I will be fighting hard in Albany to tie up these loose ends, and to deliver comprehensive policy reforms that enshrine the ideals of equality and fairness that this great State was built upon.

					Daily News: Looking to fight back against President Trump’s immigration policies, the state is set to dedicate $10 million in its emerging new budget for immigrant legal services, the Daily News has learned. The commitment, to be announced by Gov. Cuomo and the eight-member Senate Independent Democratic Conference, is said to be the largest of its kind in state history.<br /><br />“The IDC is committed to helping immigrants as a part of this year&#039;s budget process, and this is a clear, unquestionable way of doing just that,” <strong>said Sen. Jose Peralta</strong>.<br /><br />Link to entire article: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-dedicating-10-million-immigration-legal-services-article-1.3020676" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-dedicating-10-million-immigration-legal-services-article-1.3020676</a>

					PS 143 is getting a new, state-of-the-art permanent addition. <br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Post:</strong><br />Plans for a 1,000-seat building at Corona school unveiled by officials today<br />Local officials unveiled plans for a huge expansion to P.S. 143 in Corona, which will bring nearly 1,000 permanent seats to the school to replace decades-old classroom trailers and a mini building.<br />In an effort to alleviate overcrowding, State Senator Jose Peralta and the School Construction Authority revealed plans to build a five-story addition to the 34-74 113 Street school with 980 new seats today.<br />“Like I said many times, no child, no child, should be educated in a trailer, and I hope once this project is completed, overcrowding at PS 143 will just be a chapter of its history,” said Peralta, who has been pushing for an expansion to the school since 2013.<br />The new building is slated to open in September 2020, with new science labs, art and music rooms and a large cafeteria.<br />The building is expected to alleviate the overcrowding problem at PS 143, which was built to serve 900 students, but currently has about 1,800 students enrolled, many of whom are being educated in six classroom trailers, a mini building and an annex on 98th Street.<br />About 200 first grade students are currently educated in the trailers.<br />“These so-called temporary classroom units, or trailers, have been here for decades. And just yesterday, students in these trailers faced frigid temperatures, making it difficult for them to learn,” Peralta said.<br />The addition will be built on land owned by the Parks Department.<br />“Parks is happy that we were able to work with the School Construction Authority to design a solution that allows the school to expand, while also improving the recreational amenities in Louis Armstrong Park,” said Queens Borough Parks Commissioner Dorothy Lewandowski.<br />&nbsp;

					From Senator Jose Peralta:<br /><br />State Senate Passes Senator Peralta’s Bill to Tackle Speeding in School Zones<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />East Elmhurst, NY — State Senator Jose Peralta’s legislation aimed at cracking down on drivers who speed in school zones passed the New York State Senate this afternoon. Under the bill, drivers convicted of two or more speeding violations in school zones during school hours, over an 18-month period will have their licenses suspended for sixty days. This is the first time the bill has moved from the Senate’s Transportation Committee.<br /><br />Senator Peralta introduced the bill (S.336B) in an effort to protect schoolchildren and surrounding communities, holding reckless and negligent motorists who speed responsible for their actions. In 2015, according to New York City’s Department of Transportation, more than one thousand children under the age of 17 were injured in traffic crashes. Nine children were killed, and more than 200 were injured.<br />&nbsp;<br />“Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury-related death for children between the ages of 5 and 14,” said Senator Peralta. “The safety of our children is a top priority for me, and this bill is one more tool to protect them. This is all about saving lives and making our street safer for all of us.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The school speeding zone legislation will place penalties in line with the current construction and work zone rules, in which drivers lose their licenses for 60 days if convicted of two or more speeding tickets in these areas. <br /><br />“The same way we protect the construction workers on our highways, we must also ensure that we protect the State&#039;s schoolchildren,” Senator Peralta added.<br />&nbsp;<br />In 2013, a study revealed that at least three in every four motorists exceeded the speed limit within a quarter of a mile of 100 schools surveyed by the City’s Department of Transportation. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Senator Peralta hopes the New York State Assembly will now move to pass his proposal; Assemblymember Deborah Glick (D-Manhattan) is sponsoring the legislation in that chamber. <br /><br />“I want to thank my friend and colleague Assembly Member Glick for sponsoring this bill. We are working together, along with Transportation Alternatives and other advocates, to protect the more than one million school kids who travel to and from school every day,” said Senator Peralta. “I also want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for passing this commonsense legislation.”

					From Senator Peralta: I have been a progressive voice throughout my political career, first in the New York Assembly and now in the New York State Senate. As a public servant, a job I hold dear to my heart, I continue to fight tirelessly for economic justice and social equality. Among the issues I am most proud of was the passage of the same-sex marriage bill. Before we were able to legalize same-sex marriage, this piece of legislation failed to pass the Senate in part because of opposition from four mainline Democrats. When it passed in 2011, New York became the largest state to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. And recently, we also celebrated as New York approved the country’s first paid Family Leave program, and the historic raise to $15 in the state’s minimum wage.<br />&nbsp;<br />But there is more work ahead, especially now, under the current anti-immigrant political climate, In response to President Donald Trump’s orders to enforce immigration policies and the recent federal raids, I have declared my district a Sanctuary District. We are gearing up efforts to protect our immigrant communities, and as part of that, I established an emergency hotline to provide assistance to anyone who may need help.<br />&nbsp;<br />At the local level, revitalizing Roosevelt Avenue is at the top of my list of priorities. In a multifaceted approach to clean up Roosevelt Avenue, I proposed legislation to establish a Commission on Roosevelt Avenue to tackle criminal activity. In addition, I also called upon the New York State Liquor Authority to stop granting on-premises liquor licenses for new nightclubs along the Avenue, and urged the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) to increase enforcement of cabaret license laws. Under my proposal, Consumer Affairs will be authorized to impose fines of up to $10,000 for violations of cabaret licensing rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;College Affordability. As I have for the past several years, my top priority is providing college financial assistance to students regardless of their immigration status. For far too long, New York State has punished undocumented students, treating them like second-class citizens. This unfair policy has to cease. That is why the Independent Democratic Conference proposed to raise the Tuition Assistance Program income eligibility for families earning up to $125,000, including for undocumented students. <br />·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Horrors in Homeless Housing. Along with my colleagues in the Independent Democratic Conference, last month we unveiled a report detailing the deplorable conditions in the City&#039;s hotels and cluster sites used to house homeless New Yorkers. Over the last few years, my constituents have been raising concerns about the increasing number hotel to homeless shelter conversions in the District. <br />·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Closing the carried-interest loophole. Recently, I unveiled legislation to impose an additional 19.6% fee on carried-interest income. According to a report by the Independent Democratic Conference, closing the carried-interest loophole will provide the State with $3.5 billion, money that can go to build new schools, upgrade infrastructure, and protect all New Yorkers, especially during these uncertain times.

					This is a piece in the Daily News regarding Senator Peralta&#039;s push to expand the state&#039;s Tuition Assistance Program to all students regardless of their immigration status. <br />-------<br /><br />Breakaway Senate Dems want undocumented immigrants to receive college financial aid in N.Y.<br /><br />ALBANY — A group of eight breakaway Senate Dems plan to make a college affordability proposal that would cover undocumented immigrants its priority in the coming state budget negotiations.<br /><br />The Senate Independent Democratic Conference would expand the state&#039;s Tuition Assistance Program to include more people regardless of immigration status.<br /><br />With budget talks soon to heat up, the IDC&#039;s newest member, Sen. Jose Peralta (D-Queens), said the conference’s college affordability plan is its &quot;number one priority.&quot; Peralta, who has long been the Senate sponsor of a bill to create a state DREAM Act, has been heavily criticized the past week for defecting from the mainline Dems.<br /><br />The original IDC plan, first detailed by the Daily News in January, sought to raise the Tuition Assistance Program’s family income eligibility limit to $200,000 a year, up from $80,000. But the IDC has since lowered the top eligibility level it is pushing to $125,000, which is in line with a plan that Gov. Cuomo proposed to make public college tuition in New York free for some families.<br /><br />The maximum TAP award under the IDC proposal would grow to $5,815, up from $5,165. The minimum TAP award would double to $1,000.<br /><br />Peralta said he hopes the fact the plan would mean more tuition help for working and middle class families that make up many of the Senate Republican districts would win GOP support even if it also covers undocumented immigrants.<br /><br />“This plan gets financial aid to those that need it,” he said. “We need to expand TAP. We need to help more students regardless of immigration status.”<br /><br />The IDC is aligned with the Senate Republicans in a leadership coalition that has come under greater attack from many in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party since the election of President Trump.<br /><br />Though the IDC points to successful efforts last year to raise the minimum wage and create a statewide paid family leave program, insiders say the breakaway conference is under pressure to deliver on a number of Democratic initiatives like the DREAM Act that Peralta has long championed.<br /><br />Senate Republicans not only oppose the idea of giving state tuition money to undocumented immigrants, they made it a big campaign issue in many districts last year.<br /><br />Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan (R-Suffolk County) reiterated his conference’s opposition to the concept on Tuesday.<br /><br />“I think the position of our members is let&#039;s make sure we are taking care of the hard working middle class taxpayers who are struggling right now,” Flanagan said. “Our conference is strongly opposed to the DREAM Act.”<br /><br />It’s unclear if that opposition would soften if rather than passing a separate DREAM Act bill, the provisions were part of a broader budget bill that included more tuition assistance for middle class families.<br /><br />Peralta and the IDC are hoping it will. Cuomo again included a call to create a state DREAM Act in his budget plan unveiled in January.<br /><br />“I believe this is going to be the year we get this done,” Peralta said.<br /><br />Senate Democratic spokesman Mike Murphy said that “for a supposed Democrat to claim a top priority is the DREAM Act while at the same time empowering Trump Republicans who have stood in the way for years and have used bigoted and offensive mailings to oppose (that) very legislation is the ultimate act of political deception and the public and advocates will see through this ploy.&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, Assemblyman Francisco Moya, a Queens Democrat who has long carried the DREAM Act bill in his chamber, said he hadn’t seen the IDC plan and couldn’t comment on it.<br /><br />But he said he’d like to see Peralta and the IDC push the DREAM Act as separate legislation.<br /><br />“They have a lead sponsor for the New York State DREAM Act as part of their conference now,” Moya said. “Let’s get it done.”

					This is the article published by Times Union regarding Senator Peralta&#039;s efforts to offer labor protections and rights to 100,000 farmworkers in New York. Currently, farmworkers don&#039;t have a right to a day off, overtime...<br /><br />Times Union: <br />Boris Martinez typically works from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day during the summer without a day off.<br /><br />A Long Island farmworker and native Spanish speaker, Martinez says it doesn’t matter if he’s sick or an important matter to attend to “our bosses only care that we produce for them.”<br /><br />Martinez, who appeared in Albany on Monday to share his experiences, is among those pushing for a long-stalled Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, an omnibus bill that would give farmworkers a number of labor protections. The legislation would provide, among other things, the right for farmworkers to collectively bargain, a day of rest for farmworkers, overtime pay and certain minimum wage protections.<br /><br />Though the legislation has passed the Democrat-controlled Assembly in years past, it lacks key sponsorship from Senate Majority Republicans that would signal it is ready for passage in that house of the Legislature (it hasn’t come up for a vote in previous years, either).<br /><br />The bill, now prime-sponsored by members of the Independent Democratic Conference (a band of Democrats in the Senate who have formed a majority coalition with the Republicans), comes up again in 2017 at an interesting time politically. On Monday, the national political winds swirling around immigration policy came up more than once.<br /><br />“You have a Donald Trump who’s really castigating immigrants,” state Sen. Jose Peralta, D-Queens, said. “Now is a time for us to step up and be that front line of protection.”<br /><br />Though the legislation in question is geared toward labor, the issue of migrant farmworkers being boxed out of certain state labor protections has been at the fore of the debate over this bill. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the state last year on behalf of a Spanish-speaking North Country dairy worker who claimed he was fired after attempting to organize fellow employees.<br /><br />Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately said his administration would not defend against the suit in court. The New York Farm Bureau was granted intervenor status as the defendant in the case, and is awaiting a judge’s ruling on a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.<br /><br />In the meantime, the senators are pressing for a law because, as Peralta put it, “we don’t want any questions unanswered, and by codifying, it’s in the statute and we know there are no questions. Now we get to enforce it.”<br /><br />Farmers remain vehemently opposed to the legislation.<br /><br />Farm Credit East, a financial services provider for Northeastern farmers, issued a report in November looking at just the overtime pay implications of the legislation. It projected that farm net income would drop by 45.4 percent once a $12.50 minimum wage is fully phased-in by 2021 and if farmers are required to provide overtime pay. That equates to a 2.5 billion decline in gross farm sales, leading to a “significant” decline in agriculture sector employment statewide.<br /><br />“Particularly urban lawmakers like to speak in generalities about the hardships facing farmworkers when farmers in reality are providing them with opportunities, they’re providing them with jobs well above the minimum wage in most instances,” New York Farm Bureau spokesman Steve Ammerman said, adding that workers often are given housing and other amenities as well. “I think it’s a fallacy that farmworkers are not treated well.”

					Message from Senator Peralta: <br /><br />In a political climate defined by President Trump&#039;s un-American executive order on immigration and his anti-immigrant rhetoric dating back to his campaign, I want you to know that the 13th Senatorial District is a sanctuary district. My office will continue, as it always has, to assist and to protect immigrants and their families.<br />The president&#039;s executive order is incompatible with our American values. I said it many times before, but I will protect my district, probably the most diverse district in the nation.<br />In response to this repulsive situation, the New York State Independent Democratic Conference announced the creation of the Immigration Defense Coalition. My office will provide legal services from partnering immigration organizations to help immigrants and their families, including one-on-one assistance related to visas, green cards, deportation and questions about the impact of the new Administration&#039;s policies. <br />
