				We&#039;ve used Windowrama in Flushing for some insert windows, no interior molding work was required though.

				I would stay away from Window-Fix.&nbsp; We hired them to fix our double hung windows.&nbsp; They could not fix them.&nbsp; They took our money.&nbsp; They literally came to my home over 15 times because their work product was poor.&nbsp; They did some work on one window and they did such a bad job that the window cannot be opened because the panes will literally fall into the apartment.&nbsp; I am now in the market to replace all of my windows.&nbsp; By the way, Window-Fix quoted three different prices for new windows that had a huge range, i.e., approximately $2,000 difference.&nbsp; The prices kept going up.&nbsp; I spoke to different people and there was no consistency.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that they are dishonest.&nbsp; I am suggesting that if you are looking to repair windows, stay away from them.&nbsp; I am also suggesting that the workers have vastly different opinions that I found troubling. This was a nightmare experience.&nbsp;

				If I were doing this right now, and I sincerely wish our co-op would consider it, I would want historically accurate windows. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s a concern for your project, but I&#039;ve been following articles on co-ops that are doing this. I would definitely look into Skyline Windows, who did Tudor City&#039;s replacements. They&#039;re mentioned in this article:<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/realestate/the-red-tape-of-new-windows-in-new-york.html<br /><br />
