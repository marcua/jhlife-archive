				Several months back I found this portrait in the trash on 75th Street between 37th and 35th Avenues.<br />I&#039;d like to know if anyone has any information about her.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/FZEomVx.jpg)

				my ex and i bought a house a block over in 1996. the elderly Romanian woman who owned it was quite literally on her deathbed, and while we met her, the sale was handled by her almost-as-elderly sister (and niece) who lived next door. the Spanish houses. this looks like something that could have been among their belongings. not in the house we bought (and she sold a few years ago), but maybe the one next to that.<br /><br />i know the admins don&#039;t like too much personal info given out, but their last name was Giurgiu. i believe the sister has passed away by now as well.

				Hey thanks dssjh! But idk... the portrait was on the next block. To be more specific I think it was The Clermont 35-15. <br /><br />JH use to have it&#039;s &quot;old dowagers.&quot; In the day they&#039;d be sitting on the M32 with pillbox hats and veils, white wrist gloves, smart handbags in their laps, perfectly done-up, poised and usually with a disapproving look on their faces. Likely they were heading to Saks or Altman&#039;s. That breed were some of the original tenants. As they died off a lot of interesting things were out on the sidewalk for the asking. Those days are pretty much over.<br /><br />The old gals around today are mostly the daughters of the dowagers, not quite as grand. <br /><br />I&#039;d really love to know who she was or anything about her. If someone knows and doesn&#039;t want to answer here you can always send a private message.

				Nothing to add other than to say that it&#039;s so sad when personal items like this get thrown out in the trash. Surely there was someone in the family - however distant - or a friend who would have wanted this. Same for old family photos, my heart breaks when I see them in vintage shops. I want to rescue them and reunite them with their descendants!

				Grabey I totally agree. That was one good reason for rescuing the portrait. The second reason is that I love this neighborhood, lived here nearly my entire life, and preserving little pieces of it makes me feel I&#039;ve done something. I hope you are still here come the day (not too soon) that my stuff hits the sidewalk.

				Is there no signature? No identifying information on the back? There is no great reason to believe it’s someone local. I have a few paintings like that from hither and yon.&nbsp; I must say it’s a great find.

				No signature, nothing on the back. I have not taken the stretcher out of the frame so perhaps there is something on the inside. <br />I can read written on the stretcher: SB 1-144 L whatever that may mean. <br /><br />There may not be conclusive evidence that she was somehow associated at 35-15 75 Street, but I think the chances are good. Of course if the portrait is 90 years old then there may not be anyone living who would recognize her in her youth. Someone might have known her, or her relatives, later in life and seen it in their apartment. <br /><br />Maybe I should try to track down that building&#039;s super. <br /><br /><br />
