				Off topic a bit but thought I&#039;d ask. There was a discussion about cyclist being ticketed for pasing red lights. I was always under the impression that if the intersection is clear that cyclist are allowed to proceed. Is this the case?

				The police has been ticketing cyclists. I know at least one who got one on a red light here on 34th avenue, despite easy traffic. I think it makes sense that we respect the lights too (at least until the law changes to allow just a stop, which it eventually might â€” &quot;Idaho stop&quot;).<br /><br />I try to work around it by looking far ahead at the traffic light. If it seems that I might just have to stop at the red light anyway, then I slow down and rest. In the end, it ends up being a more leisurely ride and the time difference is minimum.<br /><br />The up side is that cars parked on the bike lane are also getting ticketed (at least this week): <br />http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-NYPD-Launches-Initiative-Protect-Bicyclists-Vision-Zero-Safe-Passage-379613671.html<br /><br />As long as the rules are being applied to everyone, that&#039;s cool with me.

				I think about the same for pedestrians, wouldn&#039;t you agree? For example, if you are walking and stop at a red light, no cars or bikes coming, do you wait for a green light to cross? I don&#039;t. And, when/if you drive, do you sometimes go above the speed limit, even if slightly? I do.<br /><br />The problem is not that the a cyclist crosses a red light in a situation similar to what a pedestrian would. (Truth is: very rarely you have a cyclist hurting anyone.) The problem is if a cyclist (or a pedestrian or a driver) don&#039;t respect others on the road...<br /><br />I am totally with you here: bikes can go pretty fast and make very little noise, so they can startle. Then, even if they don&#039;t hurt, they can scare and upset you. This is probably a big reason why some people don&#039;t like cyclists.<br /><br />But this is no reason to single out bikers more than you would the other crazy people who make transit in this city sometimes dangerous or upsetting (including pedestrians)... In the end, they are pretty harmless. We would all benefit for more education and common sense on the streets.<br />

				Pedestrians rarely follow the rules here. I have witnessed a person cross on a red walk sign right in front of a police car who had a green light. Drivers.&nbsp; Totally.&nbsp; They break tons of rules. Bikers are the worst because most of us are doing our best to keep track of the unruly pedestrians and drivers and Bam! A biker comes whizzing by when you finally have a chance to go.&nbsp; They don&#039;t even say sorry.&nbsp;

				I had the opportunity to question Captain Hennesy at the last CB meeting last week, regarding ticketing cyclists on 34th Avenue. He said it&#039;s an ongoing program, not a occasional sting. Please note that a ticket for running a red light as a cyclist is $190. Cyclists are also ticketed for riding on sidewalks. There is no law on the books for cars on a sidewalk, which has killed at least 6 children in the last two years. <br /><br />As a pedestrian or driver, you have an opportunity to change cyclist behavior by yelling or telling them to yield, go behind instead of in front of a pedestrian, or to stop at the red. It&#039;s true, many cyclists have very valid reasons for going through a red light. Others, who cross in front of pedestrians are merely clueless, and give the 600,000 cyclists in this town a bad name. (thats from a DOT count)<br /><br />Learning proper methods to survive and thrive as part of NYC traffic, whether on bike, by car or on foot would make this a more civil town with less tragedy. The bike course is one way that cyclists throughout town are working on it. <br /><br />Drivers are the top of the food chain. Anyone who doesn&#039;t acknowledge that is doing damage to the culture of NYC. <br />

				Biking is the fastest, healthiest and cheapest way to travel within NYC IMO however with all these great benefits there are always rules and laws you must abide by. Bike messengers and delivery guys on bike give &quot;the average bikes&quot; a bad rap because these riders get paid based on speed of delivery etc- so actually stopping and waiting for a red light is rare. Consumer bikers are the same too-in fact I usually blow past red lights if I don&#039;t see any cars coming. $190 seems extreme for a red light violation when drivers only get charged $50 (I&#039;ve had a couple myself) I don&#039;t think I will ever LET a cop pull me over on a bike, I am just too fast:)<br />
