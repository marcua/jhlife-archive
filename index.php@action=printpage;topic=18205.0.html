				I have passed this place 50 times and never have gone in...<br /><br />&quot;For classic Spanish fare: Neighborhoods like Greenwich Village, Murray Hill, and Midtown are sprinkled with old-guard Spanish restaurants dating to the middle of the last century. The menus offer pleasing renditions of a classic cuisine, including seafood-dotted paellas, brick-red chorizo, mussels in green sauce, and grilled octopus, in addition to glasses of sherry and pitchers of sangria. A bit further afield, Jackson Heights’s Café Salamanca is a good choice, a comfortable and reasonably priced spot less touristy than the Village examples. 7905 Northern Blvd., between 79th and 80th streets, Jackson Heights — Robert Sietsema, senior critic&quot;<br /><br />https://ny.eater.com/2018/9/7/17831384/things-to-do-nyc-fall-2018

				Yes I have wondered why nobody ever mentions it. I believe I looked up Yelp reviews and they were not very promising, so I didn&#039;t consider it any further.

				I live near Café Salamanca and never patronized because I am turned off by all the servers constantly smoking outside and the garbage (clam shells, etc) always leftover near their side entrance.&nbsp; I hardly ever see anyone go in/out. I am surprised they lasted this long.

				Very good old school place. The white tablecloth vibe that people seem to crave, and very very good seafood preparations. Meats, less reliable. Thanks for the reminder; haven&#039;t been in a while.

				Maybe I&#039;m extra-picky because my mother is from Spain, but their paella is barely mediocre. It tasted like they used artificial saffron (which is very common). I took my two elderly Spanish aunts there, and they refused to go back last time they were here (took them to Armondo&#039;s instead).&nbsp; The service was meh, more indifferent than unfriendly.

				I went once after a period of living in Spain (missing the food) and found it to be really similar to the classic Spanish places in Manhattan like La Nacional. The food wasn&#039;t great, everything was old-school. Haven&#039;t gone back since but would probably give it another shot.
