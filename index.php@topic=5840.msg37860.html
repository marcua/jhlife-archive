Long a magnet for immigrants, the area today is dazzlingly multifarious: more than 30 languages are spoken, including Bengali, Korean, Spanish and Urdu. Nearly two-thirds of residents were born abroad, according to census surveys from 2005 to 2009. <br /><br />Multimedia<br />Slide Show <br /><br />Living In | Jackson Heights, Queens<br />Map <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />But over the last five or six years, brokers say, new arrivals from far-flung lands have increasingly been joined by young professionals migrating much shorter distances: north from Brooklyn, or east from Manhattan and the Queens neighborhood of Astoria. <br /><br />The ranks of these new buyers are thick with architects, academics, lawyers and artists. â€œThese are people who are not Wall Street types, and who tend to be creative professionals,â€ said Daniel Karatzas, an associate broker with the Beaudoin Realty Group and author of â€œJackson Heights: A Garden in the City,â€ a history published in 1990 with support from a local civic group. â€œFifteen years ago, this was not on their radar screen.â€ <br /><br />Projit Mallick, a lawyer in his 30s who grew up in Kolkata (previously transliterated as Calcutta) and Los Angeles, is one Astoria transplant. Drawn by the abundant prewar housing stock, Mr. Mallick in 2004 paid $295,000 for a three-bedroom co-op on 82nd Street with his new husband, Andy Theodosiou, a naturalized Greek-American raised in Astoria. Their 1,500-square-foot apartment is a distinctive space created by a previous owner, who conjoined a pair of one-bedrooms, turning the superfluous second dining room into a third bedroom. <br /><br />The combined units, which Mr. Mallick and Mr. Theodosiou redid themselves, proved a boon in another way as well. Mr. Mallick, a practicing Hindu, noted that the extra kitchen faced northeast, the quadrant associated in Indian tradition with the water element of the universe. This was an auspicious orientation for a prayer room, which he gave a modern flair with a chrome Sputnik lamp and a metallic blue wall. <br /><br />â€œThe other option was to turn it into a huge walk-in closet,â€ Mr. Mallick said. â€œGod won over fashion.â€ <br /><br />Jackson Heights was a good fit for Mr. Mallick in a couple of other ways as well. An avid cook, he makes frequent visits to the South Asian commercial district centered on 74th Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenues, where he buys nuts and spices at the Indian food emporium Patel Brothers. And the areaâ€™s prominent gay community also increased Mr. Mallickâ€™s comfort level. Although he doesnâ€™t frequent gay nightspots on Roosevelt Avenue like Club Atlantis and Friendâ€™s Tavern, he said, â€œyou want to be in a neighborhood where you feel safe and welcome.â€ <br /><br />As young professionals have moved into the area, a few sleek businesses have opened up to cater to them. Espresso 77, on 77th Street, serves a mean cafÃ© au lait in a cozy storefront adorned with the silk-screens of a local artist. The owner of Table Wine, a specialty shop tucked in among older mom-and-pop stores on 37th Avenue, is known to recommend just the right bottle for dinner parties. And Starbucks has made a relatively unobtrusive foray into the area, taking up residence, hermit-crab style, in the 1947 former headquarters of the development company that conceived Jackson Heights. <br /><br />â€œPeople like changes, but the majority of people donâ€™t want too many changes,â€ said Vladimir Simkhovich, a 30-year resident and the broker-owner of Jackson Heights Properties. â€œAnd thatâ€™s the beauty of Jackson Heights.â€ <br /><br />WHAT YOUâ€™LL FIND <br /><br />That the neighborhood possesses an unmistakable sense of place is no accident. The Queensboro Corporation, spurred by the 1909 opening of the Queensboro Bridge, which linked to 59th Street in Manhattan, bought and gradually developed a vast swath of land between Roosevelt Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Influenced by the Garden City movement and by the Georgian dormitories of Harvard University, the companyâ€™s president and architects set out to create a model middle-class urban suburbia, which took as its unit of planning the entire city block rather than an individual building. <br /><br />The signature feature was, and remains, the â€œgarden apartmentâ€ complex: a series of architecturally unified, cooperatively owned apartment houses built around an undivided, shared garden. Stylistically the complexes are often quite distinct from one another, so that a short stroll can take one past French Gothic mansard roofs, neo-Georgian gabled dormers, and Italian Romanesque/Renaissance towers. <br /><br />The sense of a guiding hand behind the streetscape, and the generous proportions of its prewar apartments, appeal to design-conscious buyers. <br /><br />â€œThe rooms are gracious,â€ said Gloria Mizutani, an architect, who last April moved into a two-bedroom prewar apartment on 78th Street, for which she and her longtime companion, David Hendershot, paid $345,000. â€œAnd itâ€™s really nice in the summer to have a nice, civilized glass of wine with cheese while sitting out in the private garden.â€ <br /><br />Slide Show <br /><br />Living In | Jackson Heights, Queens<br />Jackson Heights, with more than 67,000 inhabitants, is conservatively considered to be the parallelogram of land bounded by Roosevelt Avenue on the south, Junction Boulevard on the east, Northern Boulevard on the north, and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway on the west. But there is no unanimity on boundaries; many would include an area north of Northern Boulevard. <br /><br />At the neighborhoodâ€™s heart is a landmark district whose irregular, jigsaw borders run from 76th to 88th Streets, between Roosevelt Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Its many co-ops offer generous quantities of light and air at a fraction of Manhattan prices. <br /><br />â€œImportant in its own time,â€ the architect Robert A. M. Stern has written, â€œJackson Heights seems even more so now, when the shortcomings of virtually every one of our efforts to provide multifamily housing are all too evident around us.â€ <br /><br />WHAT YOUâ€™LL PAY <br /><br />The most coveted co-ops are those in pre-1925 elevator buildings, which have fireplaces, formal dining rooms and blocklong internal gardens. Three-bedrooms in these buildings typically sell for $500,000 to $550,000, said Mr. Simkhovich, adding that two-bedrooms range from $400,000 to $500,000. Post-1929 prewar buildings are less sumptuous but still offer high ceilings and period details, and some have sunken living rooms; a two-bedroom with one bath sells for $280,000 to $350,000, said Mr. Karatzas, the Beaudoin associate broker, who compiles a quarterly sales report on the area. <br /><br />One-bedrooms in postwar co-ops cost $120,000 to $190,000, Mr. Karatzas said; three-bedroom prices are in the mid- to high $200,000s. <br /><br />In the 1920s the Queensboro Corporation also built picturesque red-brick English garden homes. Usually three stories high with a garage or common rear driveway, such a house sells for $575,000 to $850,000, Mr. Karatzas said, depending on condition and whether it is a one- or two-family. In the 1930s, two-story one-family houses went up; these sell for $550,000 to $650,000. <br /><br />There are 49 houses on the sale market, and as for rentals, Diane Macari, a broker-owner of Exit Realty Lewis and Murphy, estimates that there are at least three dozen. â€œA one-bedroom would rent for anywhere between $1,100 and $1,800 a month,â€ she said. An analysis by Louis Macari, Ms. Macariâ€™s business partner and uncle, found that residential properties are spending an average of eight months on the market. â€œThatâ€™s substantially improved from last year at the same time,â€ he said, â€œwhere we had probably 12 months on the market.â€ <br /><br />WHAT TO DO <br /><br />The area is a chowhoundâ€™s paradise. The Jackson Dinerâ€™s Indian buffet is legendary, and the Delhi Palace does a nice biryani. Lali Guras, known for its Himalayan fare, is a popular meeting spot for Tibetans from all over Queens. Pio Pio draws crowds for its Peruvian chicken. <br /><br />Alternative lounges with a youthful vibe include Dâ€™Antigua and the Terraza 7 Train Cafe, where musicians play Latin music from a suspended stage. <br /><br />During the Historic Jackson Heights Weekend on June 18 and 19, many of the neighborhoodâ€™s normally private interior gardens will be open to the public. <br /><br />THE SCHOOLS <br /><br />Public options include two on 37th Avenue, Public Schools 69 and Q222, both of which got an A on its recent city progress report. There are two intermediate schools, No. 230, on 34th Avenue, which got an A, and No. 145, on 80th Street, which got a B. The Renaissance Charter School, which runs from kindergarten through Grade 12, got a B from the city. SAT averages were 470 in reading, 492 in math, and 486 in writing, versus 439, 462 and 434 citywide. <br /><br />THE COMMUTE <br /><br />The area is blessed with an alphabet soup of subways. The E, F, M, R and 7 trains all stop at the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue/74 Street-Broadway station complex. The commute to Midtown Manhattan runs 12 to 25 minutes. La Guardia Airport can be reached by public bus in half an hour or less. <br /><br />THE HISTORY <br /><br />According to Mr. Karatzasâ€™s book, Jackson Heights was named for John Jackson, the president of the company that ran the Jackson Avenue trolley along what is now Northern Boulevard. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/realestate/06living.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/realestate/06living.html</a><br /><br /><br /><br />__._,_.___</div>

They were posted on Jackson Heights Families.&nbsp; It&#039;s positive news for Jackson Heights for sure and it does seem like all eyes are on us. Now if we could use that positive attention to our advantage and get a park from the Garden School and prevent a monstrosity on 37TH Ave. and 85TH st. (site of the fire)...well that would be awesome. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37761">While I appreciate the coverage of JH in the NY Times on February 6, I find the article somewhat condescending.&nbsp; It implies that a long-time resident like me was simply a naÃ¯f who wasnâ€™t sophisticated enough to understand or treasure the housing stock.&nbsp; Nothing could be further from the truth.&nbsp; I moved here 20 years ago this April, from Park Slope, I might add, and bought one of the â€œcovetedâ€ apartments for a mere 72K.&nbsp; I worked in product management at Knoll Design at the time, so I think that qualifies me as having a â€œdesign conscienceâ€.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The people I met then and became friends with, who for the most part still live here, were and are foodies, artists, theater people, publishing people, fashion industry people, writers, lawyers and architects.&nbsp; They were among the first community activists and concerned neighbors, many of whom like today, were parents with young children, who banded together and worked tirelessly to restore Travers Park, get the neighborhoodâ€™s Landmark designation, move The Renaissance Charter School from LIC to JH, and restore many of the neglected private gardens and buildings that these Johnny-come-latelies think they have â€œdiscoveredâ€.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />While I welcome these new neighbors and the positive direction in which JH continues to grow, unfortunately, a small percentage of the folks moving here now are arrogant and think the neighborhood is wonderful simply because they have arrived.&nbsp; Maybe they need to be gently reminded, as they are enjoying their â€œcivilizedâ€ glasses of wine in the garden, (something many of us have been enjoying for decades), that they are little more than the real estate version of rich folks who were born on third base and think they hit a triple. <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37791">It&#039;s funny that everyone wants to think they were the first to discover Jackson Heights. &nbsp;The truth is the Times has been running almost the same article about the neighborhood for ages.<br /><br />Anyone want to guess what year this article came out in the Times? I edited out the details like prices of apartments and names of shops so it wouldn&#039;t be too obvious. &nbsp;Hint: <strong>it is more than 25 years ago!</strong><br /><br /><strong>JACKSON HEIGHTS</strong><br />A walk through Jackson Heights is best accompanied by a hearty appetite, a vast curiosity about small shops - there are some 600 - and a knowledge of the difference between a griffin and a gargoyle. <br /><br />Roosevelt Avenue, the border to the south, runs under the long, thin shadows of the train. On this street, it is possible to purchase a house or rent an apartment from a Spanish, Indian or Chinese real-estate dealer, buy a sari, have a corned beef on rye... live with the noise of the train and see a father...pushing a carriage while reading philosophy. <br /><br />One block north is 37th Avenue, where shops, as small and close as those on its parallel street, seem less active ... Here, too, is heaped up variety. ..[T]here are also antique stores where owners display sofas on the sidewalk and dress boutiques, health-food stores, and a suggestion in the facades of the graceful architecture of the homes nearby. <br />Jackson Heights displays its frequent infusions of ethnicity like badges; from the names of the stores to the choice of holiday lights, the range is wide. <br /><br />&#039;&#039;There is no racial problem here,&#039;&#039; said Gloria Porras, a resident for 12 years. &#039;&#039;We have Balkans, Himalayans, Jamaicans up the block and Hindus on the corner, and we have some people from Guyana.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Louis Lopardi and his wife, Margaret Lundin, have lived in Jackson Heights for two years. He is a musical conductor. She works for an investment firm in what they both call &#039;&#039;the city.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Fred Kasner, executive director of the Kehilla, likes to call Jackson Heights &#039;&#039;the Upper West Side of Queens, the interesting mosaic of the borough.&#039;&#039; He said recently that he saw &#039;&#039;nothing but positive things for the community, with the significant influx of middle-class people with a commitment to community activities and cultural life.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />According to Beatrice Sanchez, who works in the Now and Then antiques store on 37th Street, Jackson Heights is &#039;&#039;one of the few areas of Queens that young people are moving into.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Kenneth Fernandez [realtor] said that most of his clients, whom he described as &#039;&#039;singles or young families,&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;want to live outside the city, but not too far.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>
