				What is the current standard broker commission for selling a cooperative?&nbsp; I know historically&nbsp; 6% is a good estimate but everything is negotiable.

				There is no industry-wide standard, however different brokerages may have set commision ranges within their company that they can offer and this may limit what you can negotiate. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=10560.msg55281.html#msg55281">Quote from: rhydewithdis on March 04, 2014, 11:44:36 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if you have to use a broker, pick a good one that knows the area well and ask them to not co-broke it, and negotiate 3-4% <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Other than the possibility that you may be able to negotiate a lower commission, I am not sure what the benefit of working with someone that does not co-broke would be.

				To not co-broke today, it is a dis-service to the seller ultimately and a bad business model. When you are selling a property, you want as many people as possible to see it, in order to maximize the selling price opportunity,&nbsp; especially in todays sellers market. In addition, the real estate the adage &quot; don&#039;t co-broke, go broke&quot; is very true. Commissions are always negotiable.

If it is <em>really</em> desirable, then of course I wouldn&#039;t use a broker at all. <br />You can negotiate a 3% commission no-broking with a broker who knows he can move the unit, much easier than you can negotiate 1.5-2% commission per broker if the deal is co-broke.<br />A good broker will have a list of clients looking for the unit you are selling, a well trafficked agency website, place an ad in the Times, etc. <br />The benefit of saving 1% or more on a 400k sale is 4k per 1%. Not much, but if you know you are priced right, then it&#039;s money in your pocket.

				A broker who does co-broke and charges a 6% commission would only have to sell your home for 3.2% more to break even (in terms of the amount left in your pocket after the commission is paid) with the broker who does not co-broke and charges a 3% commission. <br /><br />If there was a standard commission that all brokers charged, would you prefer the one that co-brokes or the one that does not?<br /><br />I personally would prefer the broker that co-brokes and can reach a greater number of people, including people that are not focusing their search in Jackson Heights. People that have been priced out of other neighborhoods are often more willing to pay over the asking price in a neighborhood they can afford when they find a home meets their needs. <br /><br />Everyone needs to decide for themselves what they feel more comfortable with. The relationship with your broker is key. Above all, be sure to find someone that you can trust.

				If your broker won&#039;t co-broke, who represents the buyer in the transaction before the lawyers get involved near closing? <br /><br />If I can&#039;t bring my representative to the table, <em>why should I trust you&gt;<br /></em><br /><br />There must be some non-co brokers out there selling shady properties. <strong>Perhaps people who are buying shouldn&#039;t trust these people, and sellers should stop using them.</strong>
