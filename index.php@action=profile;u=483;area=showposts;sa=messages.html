					Turbo tax online rocks but if you ever find yourself in need of an accountant for more complex text returns then may suggest Ruben Levit at 82-12 37th Avenue. After visiting many places in the area, and escaping in a hurry because of lack of basic customer service, I went to see Mr. Levit.<br /><br />My tax needs are different because of the many changes in my life and future plans, most importantly, my recent marital status. &quot;No big deal&quot; you might say. But when yours is a gay marriage in NY, and your marriage isn&#039;t recognized by the Federal Gov, then things get a little more labor intensive.<br /><br />Not only was he straight to the point and knowledgeable, but he was very polite and professional.<br /><br />I recommend his services and hope others have similar experiences with him.<br /><br />Yay Mr. Levit!!!&nbsp; :rockon:

					One of the problems I have with this article is how the writer fails to recognize that WE -the voters- are the government and that the politicians are merely doing what we elected them to do. Well, actually, turn out at non-presidential elections is so low that we actually don&#039;t really elect anyone. We actually deserve everything that is happening to us because very few of us volunteer to become members of our party at the grassroots level. WE could actually have a direct impact at choosing real progressives -regardless of party affiliation- who can represent the majority: the working class.<br /><br />You want real change? GET INVOLVED in your local political party. Then nominate real progressives who don&#039;t follow the status quo. Support candidates who know why election reform is needed (hint: getting money out of elections). Support candidates who understand why media reform is needed (it&#039;s not healthy having a handful of corporations control what you read, listen to and watch on the tubes.)<br /><br />btw, whenever you hear a &quot;reporter&quot; start an argument or question directed at a politician with &quot;some say that you...&quot; CHANGE the channel. A real journalist would be able to mention WHO said what. Otherwise, what they are really doing is giving you their opinion. And you know opinions are just like...

					I went to Lima Limon and I was just not impressed with the place. Mind you, I eat at La Gata Golosa (boy do they need help with decor) but their food is TASTY so I put up with the atmosphere --or lack thereof. But LimaLimon needs to improve fast. The staff is not friendly nor are they nasty. But on to the most important stuff: their food.<br /><br />I must say they have this stuffed potato which was excellent. But their tripe...(ewww...the spanish names sound better) their tripe was just not good. If you ever want to know how tripe should be cooked try Caridad on Northern Blvd and 103rd (<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />). Most Dominican restaurants know how to cook it. I *think they call it &quot;mondongo&quot;. If you want tripe with a touch of peanut butter, then try an Ecuadorian restaurant. Ask for &quot;guatita&quot;.<br /><br />Sorry Lima Limon...I won&#039;t be going back. I enjoy walking to the restaurants in the &#039;hood, but this one is just way too far for me. I wish them the best.

					I totally agree with you Pipman.<br /><br />We have Flushing Meadow Park with lots of miles of green space where kids and pets can run wild. Heck, children and adults alike can get a pretty nice workout just by, dare I say it?, WALKING to the park. If too many cars is an issue then work on making public transportation better than what is is now. I don&#039;t drive to work, I take public transportation, and it SUCKS during rush hour (9-6pm). If you care for lots of trees and cooler summer days where parents and children...blah, blah blah, then STOP having too many children! Read about the carbon foot print overpopulation has on this planet and then you can finally work on REAL solutions not just for the little block you call home but for mother earth as a whole. But no, people would rather have one block car-free even if in the process they make traffic -and air quality- worse when cars are detoured. But hey...it&#039;s all about the kids and families. Puhlease!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4461.msg32382.html#msg32382">Quote from: pipman on July 07, 2010, 05:23:22 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Interesting when someone says they don&#039;t want to be confrontational, then they go on to attack people for having cars in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I guess the same can be said that if one chooses to have kids and moves into a neighborhood with limited park/playground space, they deserve what they get.&nbsp; I am not against initiatives like the play street and the dog park.&nbsp; I think they definitely add to the neighborhood. It does seem most projects are for special interests of people with kids or dogs.&nbsp; There also is a shortage of space to sit for everyone else without kids or dogs.&nbsp; Some simple benches placed around the Travers playground perimeter would be nice so one can sit without being hit by a ball or listening to screaming kids.&nbsp; Peace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					Here&#039;s the NY Assembly site for Jose Peralta. <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=039&amp;sh=sponsor" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=039&amp;sh=sponsor</a> This lists all the legislation he has sponsored. You can click on each legislation to get a summary of such legislation. You can also view a list of the committees he belongs to.<br /><br />It&#039;s not helpful that the NY Senate site has completely removed Monseratte&#039;s sponsored bills and bills he introduced. I wish I could read the raw copy of the bills he supported. Here&#039;s an interview Monseratte gave to the Queens Courier: <a href="http://queenscourier.com/articles/2010/03/09/news/top_stories/doc4b8d7ba730c62289356659.prt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queenscourier.com/articles/2010/03/09/news/top_stories/doc4b8d7ba730c62289356659.prt</a>. I&#039;m curious to know what are the three laws he introduced and passed in the Senate. If anyone has this information from a reliable source please post a link. Also, today (Wednesday march 10) there will be a forum with the three candidates at Pride House on 37th Avenue between 76th and 77th. Right across from the Supermarket. Second floor. Hope to see you guys there.

					@ 77th.<br /><br />Totally agree with you. :rockon:<br /><br />You know what you should do when you finally open your business in JH? Have a sign that reads:<br /><br />- No illegals (after all, you wouldn&#039;t want to take their filthy money) Better yet, have a scanner that can read people&#039;s IDs so that only residents can shop at your store. And if you must allow them inside -oy!- (because of the law and shit), you can always have an area for illegals and one for legal residents. Oh...and make sure the residents get to sit at the front of the store. Yeah. Good old days! --but I&#039;m not referring to the good old days prior to the time when a whole bunch of illegals came over on ships and totally took over this land from Native Americans. Then went on to destroying entire villages because of their filthy way of living, diseases and plain old barbaric nature. Nah, that stuff happened too long ago for us to care or remember. It&#039;s not like history ever repeats itself and a group of people uses another as scapegoat when their lives aren&#039;t going the way they want them to. Right?<br /><br />I doubt you would understand my comments but if you if you having nothing better to do, pick up a history book and maybe then you will think before you write.

					Is there anyone else running other than Peralta? I know nothing about him and if he wins, I hope he is as progressive as he says he is. I&#039;m done with conservative loons who feel they have the right to tell others how to live their lives.&nbsp; :tickedoff:
