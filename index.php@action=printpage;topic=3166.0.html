				As a product of New York City&#039;s public school system, I never knew what to make of the little prep school on 79th Street known as the Garden Country Day School.&nbsp; I passed it on a daily basis when I attended JHS 145.&nbsp; I dated girls who went there.&nbsp; But save for a few glimpses through the chain link fence that surrounded what is now known as the Garden School I hadn&#039;t a clue what went on there.&nbsp; I even have a Garden yearbook from 1945 called &quot;The Cupola&quot; that has pictures of the old place. . .but after all these years I still can&#039;t get a handle on it.&nbsp; Can any of you old Heightzers fill me in?&nbsp; Does anybody have any memories of Garden Country Day?

I did know two little boys -- sons of our doctor -- who went there.&nbsp; It was considered to be far and away superior to our public schools (I attended PS148).&nbsp; If you entered their little park via an uphill winding pathway, you soon came to a lamppost and a park bench. On a misty night it was a somewhat ethereal place to sit. Part of the school&#039;s land was &#039;sawn away&#039; in order to build the city&#039;s 76th St. park adjoining it but the school and its small green park remained for many years. Perhaps it is still there.

				Yes, The Garden School as it is now called is alive and well. The school has nursery through to 12th grade. Some people remember it as<br />a school for the doctor&#039;s children but I have met many former students from various economic backgrounds. In the Upper Division there<br />are merit scholarships which increase this economic diversity. Garden School is a wonderful option to the rather large but good public<br />schools we have here in Jackson Heights. One parent needed to move a child as they were overwhelmed by the noise in PS69 and the<br />teacher said the student spent the day covering their ears or putting their head on the desk. This student is now thriving at Garden<br />School where the small class size and individual attention can help in all kinds of areas- academic, social/emotional or otherwise. The<br />high school students have done very well with their college possibilities as the students have a wide range of talents upon graduation.<br />It&#039;s a small but mighty presence still in Jackson Heights. I&#039;m sure that a visit inside could be arranged by appointment on the website.

If it were possible I would surely take you up on it. My own experience in the PS environment (PS149,148) was child shattering and I actually do remember wishing that I could attend that pretty school up on that lovely hill... At age seventy four I suspect that they would no longer have a place for me. :&#039;(

				I went to Garden Country Day School in 1960-62 - first and second grades. I have wonderful memories of it. There was a little wooden house in the back where the 1st and 2nd grades were. At recess, we&#039;d go out the back door, across the street, where there was a city park. All in all, i have wonderful memories of that school and Jackson Heights in general. The girls wore skirts and shoes with bobby-socks.<br /><br />I noticed that schools back then had around 30 students in one class with one teacher. Not like today, with the small classes and teacher assistants. But we seemed to learn better back then, less problems!

				I went to Garden School during the transition from Garden Country Day School to it&#039;s present name.&nbsp; I started in the first grade and graduated from high school with many of the same classmates that I was with in the first grade.&nbsp; &nbsp;The school was a rock in those days.&nbsp; Behavior problems were not tolerated and the faculty were there forever.&nbsp; I am sorry to read in other posts that there is high faculty turnover and the administration does not enforce a code of behavior in today&#039;s school environment.&nbsp; I remember a great hot lunch, served family style and the spring operetta performance that was held outdoors on the terraces below the old clubhouse&nbsp; (gym) on the hill. <br />As I said, I was there during transition and the clubhouse and hill were leveled after a fire, and turned into a field.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories...

				I was a student at Garden School from 1967 through 1973--middle school through high school.&nbsp; I have very happy memmories and made a few lifelong friends.&nbsp; As a retired teacher today, I am greatful for the education that I received back then.&nbsp; The school is still doing very well today, from what I understand.

				For those of us who played ball at the 78th Street Park in the &#039;60s, the Garden School was a bit of a tease -- wide open, beckoningâ€¦ and off limits. Whenever we could not get space at the 78th Street Park&nbsp; -- and that meant both main fields, the kiddie area and even the lower area (pool) we&#039;d head over to 145. If that was taken, we climb the fence at the Garden School and get some ball in until we were kicked off by the guards. Playing at the Garden School was also the first and only time I ever played ball on a non-asphalt surface until high school.&nbsp;

You must&#039;ve gone there around the time that I did as Dr. Nagelberg was the Principal then.<br />I remember Garden Country Day School very well. It was right across the street from 145.

				Fdthird - are you on the Garden mailing list? I&#039;m also a Garden grad, though earlier than you. Currently I&#039;m in charge of updating the list of alums.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t on the list and would like to be, PM me. <br /><br />Mr. Hughes died last year but Mr. Millevoi &amp; Mr. Grusky are still around. Millevoi is living in Amagansett and Grusky is still teaching.

				&nbsp;I loved Mr. Hughes-- just the nicest man.&nbsp; Mr. Grusky and Mr. Millivois were wonderful teachers---<br />Last summer when visiting Queens, I stopped by the school- brought back so many memories.&nbsp; I was a student 1967 through 1973- 7th grade through 12th.&nbsp; Mr Fisher was headmaster--horrible man, though I hate speaking ill of the dead.&nbsp; Mr. Hughs was the assistant headmaster back then--just wonderful.

				Hi - I have lots of memories, too. But from an earlier era and then a later one. I went there and also my son.<br /><br />There is a very active Alumni organization. If you are interested, I can get you information. PM me with your email.<br /><br />There is a Facebook group, too.<br /><br />Mr. Hughes was wonderful. Mr. Millevoi and Mr. Grusky are still alive, Grusky still teaching.<br /><br />Bill Hughes passed away last summer.<br /><br />And I won&#039;t speak ill of the dead, either.<br /><br />If there are any classmates you&#039;d like to get in touch with, put it in the email. I&#039;m one of the folks responsible for getting addresses!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Class of 1959/Alumni Parent Class of 1983

				&nbsp;Hi---I am on alumni site, but thanks---I had offerred to do a fund raiser--an alumni cruise where I would have donated the commissions to the school---no one was interested!&nbsp; (I am a travel agent)so since I was blown off, that left a sore spot with me.<br />But, I still have my happy memories of my time at the school.

				I remember Mr. Hughes with great fondness as a gym teacher and as being a very fair and a good person.&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Roberts was the Headmaster then.&nbsp; <br /><br />1st grade- Ms. Fellowes, 2nd grade- Ms. Arnold, 3rd grade- Ms. Whitney, 4th grade- Ms. Davis, 5th grade- Ms. O&#039;Brien, 6th grade- Ms. Smith, 7th grade- Mr. Brody for home room and Social Studies, 8th grade- Mr. Brody again, I think.<br /><br />In 6th grade Ms. Flowers was our English teacher.&nbsp; She was the wife of the first headmaster. Somewhere in there, Mr. Fisher was a chemistry teacher.&nbsp; Mr. Stevens was the art teacher. Ms. Nagy was the girls&#039; gym teacher.&nbsp; Ms. Sardell for French.&nbsp; Mr. Angel for math.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of this without looking at my old report cards with&nbsp; bad conduct &quot;Needs Improvement&quot; marks all over them.<br />Does anyone remember Mr. Donnelly, the 7th grade English teacher?<br /><br />My goodness!&nbsp; &nbsp;Best, Ed
