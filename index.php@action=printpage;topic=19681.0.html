				I will need to renew my drivers license soon. Which DMV in Queens is best and or closest to Jackson Heights? Also, if anyone knows which day(s) would be less crowded? I heard with the new enhanced license requirement they are all super busy.<br />Thanks!

				I’ve been to the one in Whitestone whenever I need to go, and it is really quick. They have paid parking which is a help for a couple of dollars. When you first walk in it looks daunting, but just speak to the woman at the door and she will direct you. They also have a kiosk there if you were doing something basic that also helps you get out quicker. They also have a DMV express I believe in Manhattan on 34th St. That could also be an alternative if you’re doing a simple transaction

				You can go online and make an appointment.<br />https://dmv.ny.gov/offices/make-reservation-visit-dmv-office<br />Then it probably does not matter as much which office you visit.

Make sure you tell them you have an appointment. I did this for Whitestone. And even though the place is cavernous and chaotic, it wasn&#039;t too horrendous with an online appointment.

				I have a few tips.&nbsp; I went to the DMV in Whitestone on Yom Kippur and the place was packed with people with school age kids because&nbsp; the schools were closed that day.&nbsp; I waited over two hours to renew my license so&nbsp; don&#039;t go on a day when the schools are closed.&nbsp; I also went&nbsp; in the fall before undocumented immigrants were able to get&nbsp; driver&#039;s licenses so I am sure the place will be more crowded now.&nbsp; <br /><br />If&nbsp; you want to get a REAL ID so you can board a plane come October 2020 make sure you have proper documentation.&nbsp; I was unable to locate enough documents that morning and couldn&#039;t get a&nbsp; REAL ID and&nbsp; my driver&#039;s license displays &quot;not for federal purposes&quot;.&nbsp; During the holidays I was stopped by the police in CT because I had a break light&nbsp; out and the officer quipped, &quot;not for federal purposes you don&#039;t look like an illegal alien&quot; and then laughed.&nbsp; I think it is&nbsp; going to be clear that anyone who looks like they are foreign born and doesn&#039;t have a REAL ID license will be suspected of being in the&nbsp; country illegally without a REAL ID driver&#039;s license.

				I believe the Manhattan Express was closed due to a fire. I would also recommend making an appointment, but you can still renew some licenses online.

				If you are updating to a RealID to be able to use your DL to board domestic flights, you need to go in to renew. RealID or Enhanced is needed after OCT of this year. Otherwise, you will need to use your passport to board any flights.

				Thank you all for your replies! I made an appointment at the Whitestone location on March 9th. The express DMV in the city had a fire and is closed until further notice.<br />I will follow up and let you know how it goes!
