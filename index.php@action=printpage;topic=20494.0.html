				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I live in the Greystones closer to the 37th end. Ever since last week we noticed a young man who revvs his motorbike in the middle of the night (starting usually around 3/4am). At first it seemed he was under the influence and revving for the sake of revving but the past few nights it seems like he&#039;s leaving and coming back several times in the night. It&#039;s unclear if he&#039;s going to/from work and running deliveries. The motor/exhaust is incredibly loud and wakes up everyone in our house (some of our neighbors also confirmed). <br /><br />Have you noticed this? Has anyone tried to do anything about it? I am strongly opposed to getting cops involved but surely there&#039;s a way we can resolve this as a community. I&#039;m frustrated/desperate and keep being woken up in the middle of the night and wanted to vent to my neighbors, thanks!

				Maybe he doesn&#039;t have a watch? When you tell hay it&#039;s 4 in the morning, he knows what time it is. Sorry, old joke. He was on my block lat Thursday at 5 or so in the morning, so I can empathize.

				He was racing up 35th Ave between 84 &amp; 85 a few times between 10-11:30PM last night. Or maybe that was his brother. Either way was really obnoxious.

				Yes weâ€™re at 83rd and 35th Ave and noticed him or her too&nbsp; - they seem to be riding a loop around the area. Very loud and fast. Dangerous.

				Clocked in around 3:30 am two nights last week on 35th in the 80s.&nbsp; Also saw him earlier one evening.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope this can be stopped, the amount of excess noise seems to have increased from cars honking and alarms, noisy Fresh Direct delivery trucks, loud people, and now this jerk on his motor bike--thankfully airplane noise is not as much an issue for now, but that will likely change as travel picks up.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This sounds exactly like what we experienced on 77th st between 37th and 35th last summer into fall. Weird. Could it be the same person?

				I&#039;m pretty sure I heard this last night (Apr 19) between about 10pm and midnight. The guy kept coming around every 15 minutes or so.

I saw a dark scooter making a loud noise as if it had no muffler. As I saw it speed away on 35th Ave. at 74th St. the rider stood up and put his foot on the seat and then sat on his foot. <br /><br />Today, I saw a yellow Harley Davidson being towed away from 74th St. near 35th Ave.&nbsp; Reason unknown.&nbsp;
