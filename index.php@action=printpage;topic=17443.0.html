				JUST RELEASED: Our exclusive 4th Quarter 2017 Elliman Reports for the Brooklyn, Queens &amp; Riverdale Markets<br /><br />Dear Friends,<br />&nbsp;<br />It is with great pleasure that I share with you the just-released fourth quarter 2017 “Elliman Reports” for the Brooklyn, Queens and Riverdale sales markets, the leading resource on the state of these markets. <br />&nbsp;<br />Our market reports are produced in conjunction with Miller Samuel to provide you and your clients with the most comprehensive and objective market insight available.<br /><br />The Brooklyn sales market continued its long-term brisk conditions with rising prices, more sales and less inventory – remaining the strongest borough overall.<br />&nbsp;<br />Queens continued to show the same pattern of record prices but saw sales slip and inventory edge higher.<br />&nbsp;<br />In Riverdale, which includes the areas of Fieldston, Hudson Hill, North Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil, we continue to see a chronic shortage of inventory which is holding back supply.<br /><br />As far as the tax law goes, it didn’t seem to have much impact unlike Manhattan as the market paused last fall. The sales declines in Queens and Riverdale began to decline earlier in 2017 and therefore seem related to low inventory and affordability. <br /><br />At Douglas Elliman, we are constantly looking for ways to provide our clients with better information, empowering them to make more informed decisions.<br />&nbsp;<br />Our efforts to create this market report series reflect our strong belief that access to timely information is a vital resource in a market that is constantly changing. Committed to providing the best information in the industry, we are proud to offer this service to you and your clients.<br />&nbsp; <br />Warmest regards,<br />STEVEN JAMES<br />Chief Executive Officer, New York City<br />Douglas Elliman<br /><br />To explore Douglas Elliman’s full slate of market reports covering Manhattan, Northern Manhattan,&nbsp; Brooklyn, Riverdale, Queens, Northwest Queens, Long Island, The Hamptons, North Fork, Westchester, Putnam &amp; Dutchess Counties, Fairfield County, Greenwich, Miami, Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Wellington, Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens, Los Angeles, Venice/Mar Vista, Malibu/Malibu Beach and Aspen, please visit the following link http://www.elliman.com/marketreports<br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />Marlene Flores - 917-208-6709<br />Douglas Elliman Real Estate<br />marlene.flores@elliman.com
