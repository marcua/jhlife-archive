				I think the transaction fees are so high with C/Cs, that with dollar purchases on them probably would have them lose money on the deal.

				I understand that the problem is the fees but still I wonder if it&#039;s a good business decision by small businesses to have those credit card minimums.&nbsp; For the increasing number of people who dont carry cash or don&#039;t always carry cash there is a subtle but sure drift towards the places that take cards unconditionally. Maybe I don&#039;t remember what their minimum is or exactly how much my item is--so I just go somewhere else.&nbsp; Taking&nbsp; credit cards unconditionally might work as a kind of a loss-leader.&nbsp; One day I want to put a $2 coffee on my visa, but it gets me in the habit of going there and next time I&#039;m buying lunch or bringing my friends.

				I am sure they don&#039;t mind charge you the minimum amount if you don&#039;t want to buy more stuff from there.<br /><br />Also, I saw a guy once at Espresso 77 did a slick trick, he end up buying a 10 dollar gift card and then charge it on his credit card. Then use the gift card to buy cup of coffee...genius ;)

				It&#039;s a bit of a pain, but I often try to have smaller bills like 5, 10 and 20&#039;s, just so I don&#039;t have to use my credit card in the smaller mom and pop stores like the produce place on 80th and 37th and the natural foods store. I do see others using their credit cards in these places and I&#039;m usually buying enough to surpass any minimum they might have, but I am aware that the fees can be pretty high for credit card usage so I try to be kind to the smaller business owner.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can also see what OP is saying, that the store might get more business if they didn&#039;t make a big deal of credit card usage. Maybe a good compromise would be to eliminate the minimums, but put a sign up asking people to please use cash if they have it on them. <br /><br />The worst part about using cash is all the coins that build up in my pockets.

				I find myself on the opposing side. There are stores like Sweetgreen in Manhattan (and other places) that are totally cashless. I find the concept off-putting and exclusionary. I believe they decided to do this to reduce possibility of employee theft/error, but it creates a two tiered society. One group has plastic to spend on a fancy salad for lunch, and the other has the funds to do so but those funds simply aren&#039;t good enough to be accepted.<br /><br />I often use my debit card at places and when they ask me if I want credit or debit I respond with &quot;whatever&#039;s cheapest for you&quot;. The laws around card fees have been changing, and I can understand that the fees can be onerous for small businesses. I try to meet them where they are at, especially since they obviously have something I want to spend money on. If they are cash only, as many restaurants in NYC can be, I make sure I have cash. I would rather have a spot err on the side of including all possible customers, that err by including only those who are savvy and wealthy enough to have a credit or debit card. Why do I want to create a trackable transaction for a cup of coffee anyway? And why must someone take a cut of that transaction? For my convenience? Eh... I just hit the ATM once in a while when I need to.

				The minimum amounts are usually pretty small, so it really shouldn&#039;t be a hardship to either make the minimum or just pay the few bucks in cash.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for it if it helps keep the unique shops in the neighborhood in business.

				It&#039;s a lousy policy that has caused me to walk out of many a store without making a purchase. Stores could easily charge the customer $1 if one wanted to use a card under a $10 purchase, or add a surcharge to each item. They would rather sell less merchandise and deal with fewer customers.

				Square is commonly used by small businesses (I use it with my clients) to collect payments by credit card. Square charges 2.75% per transaction, and 3.5% plus 15 cents for a virtual terminal transaction (taking credit card payment from a customer over your computer). I&#039;ve long understood that the reason businesses have a minimum purchase is because those fees become onerous, especially when you&#039;re dealing with a high volume, low margin business.<br /><br />I notice the new Matcha/Coffee place on 80th St. near Roosevelt has no minimum. I assume the owner has factored that fee in to his overall costs. But, I can see how in a very competitive business, that could be problematic (such as an additional 15 cents for an Americano to cover the processing fees for credit cards could drive some customers to your competitor down the block who charges a bit less.) So even though that guy takes credit cards, I pay in cash when I go there if I&#039;m not buying a lot.<br /><br />I also make a point of having at least a bit of cash on me. There have been times when credit card systems have gone down and people weren&#039;t able to get cash out of an ATM machine (I recall specifically glitches that have occurred when solar storms were happening). <br /><br />I also just can&#039;t with these new chip cards that take forever to process. I&#039;d rather hand the cashier actual cash when I just need to buy a tube of toothpaste than hold up the line and waste everyone&#039;s time so I can have the convenience of paying by credit card.

				I think some of you are missing the point.&nbsp; They are in business for my money, i don&#039;t really care what the surcharges are.&nbsp; make it convenient for the modern consumer, or run the risk of losing customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />when you are a coffee shop and sell a product for $2.50, it makes no sense to have a minimum transaction fee.&nbsp; JH is like this little bubble where you have to reach a minimum at all these stores.&nbsp; <br /><br />every independent shop in LIC, astoria, manhattan has figured this out, they have no minimum because they are competing.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />most people know cash is king, and if i happen to have cash...&nbsp; of course i will use it.&nbsp; but me like a huge # of other people my age just dont carry much cash anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />ps. i was unaware espresso77 had a gift card system, they should advertise that as an alternative.&nbsp;

Someone like you, who would walk out of business and not frequent it because you are bothered by not being put $2 on a credit card, probably represents a very small fraction of the population. The business doesn&#039;t care they aren&#039;t catering to your whims, largely because most folks are probably way more reasonable about when they insist they must be able to use their credit card. When a decent chunk of their target market cares (like maybe 10%) as much as you and your friends do that they can&#039;t use their credit card to buy a cup of coffee, then the business might care enough to change.<br /><br />If you have evidence that shows your attitude and actions are common (like, maybe represented by +10%) and growing (rather than anecdotes), I&#039;d be interested.

The plural of anecdote is not data. Also, please, you aren&#039;t being forced to not support local business. You have a choice, and <strong>you choose not to support local businesses</strong>.<br /><br />Businesses will cut the minimum purchases to accept a credit card if a large enough segment of their target market makes a fuss about it. Prices would going to go up a bit to cover processing fees. I think since many haven&#039;t, you can take that as evidence that you are in a pretty small minority for now. <br /><br />Additionally, food related businesses are usually pretty small margin businesses, and unless there&#039;s evidence that customers are likely to spend more on an average purchase when they can use a card, I think there isn&#039;t much incentive there. For example, in restaurants, it was demonstrated that people who can use a credit card to pay for a meal are more likely to spend more for their meals than someone paying cash. So there&#039;s a pretty solid business case for why those businesses should have accepted cards and the associated fees (which pre-Square, included a transaction fee for every credit card swipe). All cash restaurants are still around, but they are far less common today than they were 20 years ago.

				While carrying cash may be inconvenient, it is still the currency of this country, and it should be circulated.<br /><br />Small business offer the Credit/Debit options as a convenience.<br /><br />The fees are a sacrifice they take on by offering the convenience, fees often range from 2.49% to 3.5% and are also carry a transaction fee determined by the number of transactions and price range of transactions in a month.<br /><br />I have encouraged many businesses who have minimums below $10 to go to the $10 mark.<br /><br />They are not imposing a minimum to make people spend more, they are just trying to turn a small profit by offering the option.<br /><br />The fees have caused many neighborhood businesses to go CASH ONLY<br /><br />Rents are not cheap and we need these small businesses to survive to maintain the character of our community and to support many of the business owners of which many call our neighborhood home as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />

There isn&#039;t a convenient way to acquire cash other than making a separate trip to the bank/ATM. Back in the day, it was tolerable because cash was widely used in multiple aspects of life, but now it&#039;s become inefficient to do so because cash is so rarely used anymore. And the bank branches haven&#039;t modernized their machines. The ATMs operate slowly, only offer $20 bills, and often have long lines at peak hours. It&#039;s become a headache people want to increasingly avoid.

				&quot;Seriously, there&#039;s an ATM machine in like 1 out of 3 businesses along 37th Avenue. This is not a real issue.&quot;<br /><br />These ATMs are not cheap, and arguably not safe. You are better off spending $10 at the store and getting something for your money.<br /><br />I just shopped at a 99 cent-er on Roosie east of 90th. They also do not accept <span class="bbc_u">any</span> returns or exchanges. Someone seemed to be following me around as though I were a loss risk. They weren&#039;t friendly, and didn&#039;t offer to help me reach high-placed product even though I basically had to climb over the guy at the front. <br /><br />In that area I recommend the shop on the north side of Roosie, right at the subway stairwell. The CC minimum is $6, and the workers are locals and speak Spanish. They are all friendly to me, and always helpful.

				Just responding to the question re: dangerous to use ATMs (I have no objection to cash, and always have some with me):<br /><br />I think what jeanette might be referring to is the relative ease of putting skimmers on an ATM in a bodega vs. a bank. There has been a recent rash of such incidents in Queens, but it is a problem that has been going on for years. Here is one link, chosen very much at random<br /><br />http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/03/police-discover-skimming-devices-on-duane-reade-atms/

I know this thread was created mainly to discuss non-restaurant venues, but this quote struck me:<br /><br />&quot;McEachern said she knew she was taking a risk when she signed a new lease in 2014 — rent was $21,000 a month, plus utilities and taxes. She made several last-ditch efforts to save her business in its final years — introducing brunch and organic beverages, and accepting credit cards — but those efforts just ended up costing her more, she said.&quot;<br /><br />https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170324/east-village/angelica-kitchen-closing-friends-launch-fundraising-campaign

				^that reminds me, when I tip servers, hairstylists, whoever shampoos my hair at a salon, manicurist, etc. I always try to tip them in cash. Partly I never totally trust management to not pocket the tip or part of the tip. Partly I&#039;ve waited tables in the past and I understand cash tips are less traceable for tax purposes.<br /><br />Come to think of it, there are services where if you pay with a credit card, you will be charged sales tax, but not if you pay with cash (such as at a salon), you won&#039;t.

				I do think that cashless businesses are (eventually) the way of the future, but also worth noting that those places often charge more than the standard card minimum for virtually all of their menu items. That&#039;s fine, but it&#039;s a different business model than some of the places in JH with credit/debit minimums. Said minimums are usually around $5, and you&#039;d be hard pressed to go into a Sweetgreen and find anything for under $5 (rarely would anyone wait in that line for only a drink, and even if you did, I think they&#039;re close to $4). <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16183.msg83109.html#msg83109">Quote from: Shelby2 on December 25, 2017, 10:21:53 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This is interesting -- there are some NYC businesses that are credit/debit card only.

It&#039;s not like I don&#039;t like E77, I&#039;m just not interested in throwing money at a business like it&#039;s a charity. If they needed money to expand it should be the owner&#039;s responsibility to come up with the capital through normal funding avenues. I don&#039;t blame them for doing the &quot;go fund me&quot; type route though, if it works, it works.. Just not my style.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t mind paying an extra 2% + the transaction fee of 5-10 cents if my order is under $10 or whatever to cover their merchant account charge. The percentage itself is the same whether it&#039;s $4 or $20, so it&#039;s just that small per transaction fee that is the kicker. And that&#039;s usually way less than the percentage. If they wanted to overcharge for it and make a few pennies, then just charge people a 30-35 cent fee to use a card if the amount is under $10. Simple, everyone wins and no one is turned away or annoyed for not having cash or not wanting to add crap to their order to get above $10.

				Simple solution is to allow credit/debit card and raise the prices of the coffee and/or the food to make up for it. Especially as Jackson Heights starts to attract a younger demographic, they&#039;ll need to make this adjustment at some point.

A case about New York&#039;s &quot;no surcharge for credit card payments&quot; law actually went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2017. They basically threw it back to a lower court to decide, but noted that the law definitely concerned free speech, not just price regulations, since it regulates how people can communicate about their prices (&quot;surcharge&quot; vs. &quot;discount&quot;), not just the prices themselves.<br /><br />More discussion of the issues here:<br />http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-justices-offer-minimalist-decision-new-york-credit-card-surcharge-statute/<br /><br />That lower court (the 2nd Court of Appeals) issued a judgement in December that basically threw it down another level, to New York State&#039;s highest court, to decide. (http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/0d66148d-8f08-48db-9fb3-b4c7b7925473/1/doc/13-4533_opn.pdf)<br /><br />So, stay tuned! Soon surcharges for the use of credit cards may be legal in New York, as they are in most states. But apparently it is quite a thorny legal issue, so who knows.

				I went to Kim Brothers Produce market today and they have a new sign near the register that states they are requiring a 3.5% surcharge on credit card purchases. Even though I nearly always pay in cash when I go there, today I was running short on cash and planned to use my credit card. I told the English-speaking cashier the surcharge is illegal but she just pretty much looked straight through me like she couldn&#039;t hear me.
