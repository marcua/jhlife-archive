				Hope this helps:<br /><br />I am a caucasian female who has lived in Jackson Heights for a long time (since 1954). Yes, I work here. I rarely use public transportation. We own our coop. Since I moved here there have been many changes in population, economics, density of population, quality of stores, graffeti, etc. Basically this neighborhood was on a rollercoaster from very good to on the edge of failing. We are in a pretty stable stage depending on the overall economics of the city.<br /><br />Problems that concern me include density of population, parking concerns (too many cars) - this overlaps to double parking, driving issues, etc., crime/gangs, economic issues - empy stores, graffeti and dirt.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

				I am a Caucasian male of French/Italian background and have lived in Jackson Heights for about 20 years. I grew up in Brooklyn and during the civil rights movement my family moved to Queens.&nbsp; The one thing I love about JH is that it is a real global village where a diversity of people coexist peacefully. It&#039;s like taking a trip around the world and being able to walk home. I own a private home and work throughout Brooklyn so I&#039;m driving throughout the day. I use public transportation on the weekends to get in and out of the city.&nbsp; There have been many changes within the neighborhood, such as landmarking and&nbsp; the creation of civic groups to affect positive change. Despite this, overdevelopment with a lack of sensitivity to the design of the neighborhood has caused overpopulation and the destruction of green space. City services are not commensurate to the population numbers.&nbsp; An increase in noise, pollution,illegal conversions of single family homes , destruction of single family homes to create multiple dwellings have also acted to facillitate graffiti, drug activity&nbsp; and a lack of services for both seniors and youth. In the presence of these difficulties,&nbsp; the community remains in balance.

				female, Italian American who like the other posters is not giving out age. HA.&nbsp; Bought my co-op in 1987.&nbsp; Work in the tri-state area.&nbsp; Car only, never public trans.&nbsp; In the 21 years living here, I&#039;ve seen 37th Ave. get more diversified business, a couple of satelite shools opened up, the median divider was put back back along 34th Ave.&nbsp; Prices to buy apartments went from the late 80s high, down to rock bottom thru mid 90s, and have climbed up again.&nbsp; The Beautification Group and Historic Group have been able to have major positive impacts on most businesses along 37th Ave which took years to achieve... flower plantings, tree plantings, prettier more uniform signage on top of business... over all positive changes.&nbsp; The problems here are like the problems everywhere: affordable housing, parking, graffiti, litter, noise.&nbsp; I chalk it up to City life.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the suburbs have their own set of problems.

				Female, 45, of Russian-Jewish descent; I&#039;ve lived in JH 4-1/2 years; I don&#039;t work in JH; I use public transport; I own my apartment:<br /><br />What major changes do you think have taken place in Jackson Heights (in terms of economic development, density, housing, ethnicity, transportation, etc.)?<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve been here, what I&#039;ve seen are more families with young children moving into the historic district co-ops; I can&#039;t speak to the rest of the neighborhood. Also, somewhat more upscale retail. <br /><br />What problems in Jackson Heights cause you concern?<br /><br />My #1 concern is that we don&#039;t have enough green space, especially playground space for children. My #2 concern are the high commercial rents on 37th Avenue and the stranglehold that a few landlords seem to have over commercial property. <br /><br />

The drug years were bad, the transition in to Little India and the up swing in the Southeast Asian populaiton, the strong and very open gay community that has long been here but is seemingly more present than ever. I&#039;ve seen lots of changes in the faces of the people here and I&#039;m presuming th population has increased.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your survey is the first I&#039;m answering on this board.&nbsp; (I was actually referred by a friend from the yahoo group, only to find out that I must have joined months ago and never recalled ... that&#039;s a sign of old age!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; )<br /><br />First name (optional)?&nbsp; Rob<br /><br />Male or Female?&nbsp; Male<br /><br />Age (optional)?&nbsp; 38<br /><br />What is your ethnic background?&nbsp; Italian-Greek-Polish<br /><br />How long have you lived in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; 38 years (5 apartments all within 6 blocks of each other ... I&#039;m not really a nomad.)<br /><br />Do you work in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; No, I work in Floral Park.&nbsp; I teach special education.<br /><br />Do you drive or use public transportation?&nbsp; Public transportation, though I&#039;m a very good passenger when others drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Do you own or rent accommodation?&nbsp; Own, always have.<br /><br />What major changes do you think have taken place in Jackson Heights (in terms of economic development, density, housing, ethnicity, transportation, etc.)?<br /><br />Wow, that&#039;s a longer answer.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously the neighborhood has gone through major changes a few times in my 38 years. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as crime, I remember the street gang 70s, the wild drug 80s, the cleaner and leaner 90s, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s partially the change in the neighborhood (I recall when we first got the 115th precinct), and partially the overlying betters sense of community here.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Housing prices, after a dip in the early 90s, have skyrocketted.&nbsp; (I bought a co-op in 1993, sold it for over 200% what I paid in 2002, bought a larger co-op with those profits, and now that property is worth over twice that value.&nbsp; If I were starting out today, I&#039;d be priced out of my own neighborhood.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Economic development is different ... better and worse.&nbsp; Rather than give any one opinion, I would point out that franchises were not here when we were growing up (we had to hike to Astoria Blvd or the mall for McDonalds!), but the smaller stores were always special as well (for example, we bought our (yes, its true) RECORDS from Numbers, not the mall).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ethnicity was always diverse ... Jackson Heights was unique in that aspect.&nbsp; I recall when I went to high school at Bronx Science, there were kids from all over the city.&nbsp; There were neighborhoods that were known as predominately Italian, or Colombian, or Irish.&nbsp; Jackson Heights had no &quot;classification&quot; ... it was always diverse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Transportation was always great ... 20 minutes from Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#039;s only been improved by better service overall (although the once-19B-now-49 needs more buses!!) and more train lines.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the density is best summed up in the education.&nbsp; When I went to PS 69, kids from all over the neighborhood went there.&nbsp; We then went to IS 145 (except for the few who tried the then brand new IS 227 magnet school).&nbsp; It was a little crowded but we all fit.&nbsp; Now there are so many more kids, there are 4 extra schools ... 69 itself only takes kids from 72nd Street to 79th or 80th.&nbsp; So the population density has increased, as is reflected by that fact.<br /><br />What problems in Jackson Heights cause you concern?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The neighborhood is great, but of course it could be even better.&nbsp; Security can sometimes be an issue (I&#039;d had family assaulted outside the school while dropping children off), especially at night.&nbsp; The over pricing of the real estate tends to attract a certain &quot;trendy&quot; element that then express dissatisfaction over the way the neighborhood is.&nbsp; Some object to the noise ... me I thrive in it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, Jackson Heights is the reason so many of us are overweight!&nbsp; All this great food to eat out or order in ... why stir up the Campbells when I can get aloo gobi or pad khing or a Colombian steak?&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Yes I can blame the neighborhood for the extra pounds I packed since college.<br /><br />Glad I found your survey!&nbsp; Its a great way to introduce myself to a board that I apparently found late night months ago (ah insomnia!).<br />

Caucasian--German/Sicilian<br /><br />How long have you lived in Jackson Heights? less than a year<br /><br />Do you work in Jackson Heights? No. Manhattan.<br /><br />Do you drive or use public transportation? Public transit.&nbsp; i don&#039;t even know how to drive.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Do you own or rent accommodation? Rent<br /><br />What major changes do you think have taken place in Jackson Heights (in terms of economic development, density, housing, ethnicity, transportation, etc.)? Well I haven&#039;t been here long enough to notice, but it does appear every month that the number of younger professional people (20s) seems to slowly grow.<br /><strong><br />What problems in Jackson Heights cause you concern? </strong> <br />The lack of a good neighborhood bar with beer that does not suck.&nbsp; Perhaps people think this is a ridiculous problem, but it&#039;s one thing I can&#039;t get at all here and makes people not move here.&nbsp; It is the only thing that bums me out about living in JH.<br /><br />Vermin near the restaurants and their dumpsters when I walk home at night!<br /><br />Though I love all of our ethnic grocery stores and big ones, I would love to be able to easily/cheaply buy fancy cheese and edamame and good chocolate, etc.&nbsp; A Trader Joes/Fairway/Whole Foods, though a pipe dream, would be awesome.<br /><br />The train shutdowns on the weekend.<br /><br />Street loudness and litter.<br /><br />JH becoming hip enough to get too expensive, but not hip enough to get a good bar.<br /><br />The lack of a bookstore.&nbsp; A whole hood with NO bookstore?&nbsp; Is that even possible?<br /><br />I&#039;d love a community garden....<br /><br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t have the greenspace problem--I am super allergic and don&#039;t love large areas of non-useful watersucking grass. :)&nbsp; But I do enjoy growing things on the patio built inside of our apt buildings.&nbsp; I am actually glad they made it into a patio rather than a landscaped area.

				Caucasian female, 50+. Lived here about 5 years. Usually work in Manhattan. I have a car and I use the subway. I own a 1 bedroom coop. Since i moved here two cafes moved in and a number of businesses have gone out. I see more and more young white people. Real estate doubled since I moved here. When I first came here the subway renovation wasn&#039;t finished and now they&#039;ve finally cleaned up the horrible litter around the subway. I wish they would clean up the gum.<br />Honking of car horns can get bad. Parking pretty bad sometimes. It would be nice if there was a park, for those of us who don&#039;t have gardens. Or at least a nice safe way to ride a bike to flushing meadows or astoria park. Sometimes I feel a little trapped here, surrounded by highways. But it really is a super-convenient neighborhood to live in.
