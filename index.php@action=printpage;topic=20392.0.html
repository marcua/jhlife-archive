				My partner and I are thinking of putting an offer in on an apartment at Terrace View. People seemed fairly friendly, but after doing a little research, found some troubling comments on this board about the former board president (accusations of discrimination), as well as about the larger community in the building. Does anyone have any insight? <br /><br />In addition to those comments, I&#039;m worried about an overly intrusive board -- we are pretty quiet, don&#039;t host a lot of parties (and obviously wouldn&#039;t host any till after COVID, anyway), and don&#039;t plan on making a lot of renovations to the space, if that makes any difference. We&#039;re just new to co-ops and wondering if there&#039;s anything we should be aware of. Thanks in advance!

Since there were so many incidents at that time, there must be many more at other times. <br /><br />They got rid of gays by lawsuits (for putting up moulding), by not allowing renovations, by putting up surveillance cameras outside one couple&#039;s apartment and by harassment by neighbors. <br /><br />The building has been sued by some of the couples in various venues. <br /><br />Yes, these things happened under the former president, but it was with the knowledge and encouragement of the residents. <br /><br /><br />

				Wow, if I had heard all of this, I would never have moved in, but I did move in. I am pleased to live here. There are many different people in the coop. The same melting pot that makes Jackson Heights wonderful lives in our building. LGBTQ, People of Color, all ethnicities, and religions, enjoy this coop. You will not feel discriminated against here. With property values down a bit, now may be a great time. <br /><br />I won&#039;t say that the list of things didn&#039;t happen, but I believe they are all being a bit mischaracterized. I wasn&#039;t here in 2010, but I do know of some of these stories and they are not told in the same way jh35 tells them, but I&#039;m not saying jh35 is wrong. <br /><br />Terrace View is a nice place to live. Maybe under the old board in 2010, things were somewhat different. In the &#039;80s, the building had lots of druggies that rented, but that was a long time ago and has nothing to do with today. It&#039;s all ancient history. <br /><br />If it matters, I identify as a cis gay man. ;D<br /><br />&nbsp;
