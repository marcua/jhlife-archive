				I contacted the person who rescued this kitten.&nbsp; She told me the kitten is a female but has not been vetted so she doesn&#039;t know if it is spayed or vaccinated.&nbsp; The kitten is shy at first but playful.&nbsp; Soft gray color.&nbsp; You can contact her at elizabethrlugo@gmail.com&nbsp; From the photo, it appears to be about 4-6 months old.

				This kitten has now been spayed and tested.&nbsp; She desperately needs a home or at least a foster home.<br />If anyone is interested, please contact elizabethrlugo@gmail.com and let her know you saw this post on JH Life<br />

				Kitten is 4 months old.&nbsp; She had already been spayed when apparently someone decided they didn&#039;t want her and put her in a bag and placed her on&nbsp; 75 Street and Roosevelt Avenue in the middle of the day.&nbsp; She is playful, tiny only 5 lbs and very beautiful.&nbsp; The vet did a full blood work, tested for FIV and FelV, vaccinations, rabies, FIV vaccination, so she has definitely been &quot;vetted&quot;. She likes sleeping on the sunny windowsill and sleeps with her rescue person. She didn&#039;t do too well with children although it might have been the way they were introduced to her.<br />Anyone interested in adopting or fostering please contact the email above and tell her you saw this on JH Life.<br />

				Hi there!<br /><br />I&#039;m really interested in adopting the kitten and emailed the address you provided several days ago, but received no response. Is there any way you can help me get in touch with this person?

				Unfortunately the adoption did not work out. So she is up for adoption, again.<br />She does get along with other cats but because she is only 4 months, she has A LOT of energy and wants to play all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;The other cat in the household and the adopter should have temperaments that tolerate her activity level. She would also do well as an only cat.&nbsp; She likes high places and lounging on the windowsill. She is not a lap cat but is friendly and affectionate and likes to sleep on the bed with you.&nbsp; She is very curious but not destructive.&nbsp; I think she will remain a petite cat.<br />Anyone interested can contact me.
