				The winner is the building on the SE corner of 34th and 76th. Last summer, they cut a big tree halfway and left it like that. The grass area is a mess. Nothing has happened there in months. Anyone know what the grand plans are? <br /><br />As a side note, how is that acceptable? We say we take pride in living in a neighborhood like JH with its historic charms and maintained gardens, and then a large building like this does such a shitty job with its landscaping. What gives? <br />

				I think this may be the same building I posted about back in June, 2018. The only progress I&#039;ve seen since then is that they&#039;ve enclosed the lawn area with fencing. Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t seen any type of planting or maintenance for the Spring happening, so I doubt there will be growth of anything green anytime soon. Hoping I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; :( It&#039;s an eyesore.<br /><br />Lawn work at building on 34th Ave (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17880.msg86495#msg86495)

				Yes, that&#039;s the one! It does look so much worse now, and yes, I too fear nothing is in place for this spring/summer season.

				&nbsp;I think they have something planned. It was no prize before and the task of getting rid of the big trees that were there is a big one. The brick work around the edge is quite nice and I think they significantly upgraded<br />this complex. Will see how this season goes...

It&#039;s a work in progress! I doubt any building would fork out the amount of money it already has without planning to finish it.

				Hope you&#039;re right! The way they cut that tree halfway doesn&#039;t give me much confidence. One can spend a lot of money on a crappy project...

				Update on the landscaping project at this building. They’ve started to lay down sod, so planting may come soon? I don’t know much about gardening, but is summertime ideal for planting flowers/foliage? They have a lot of ground to cover, so this may continue to take some time before we see it finished.

				&nbsp;It&#039;s looking good to me and I kind of like that they are taking their time. If you are able to <br />water often, you can plant now but it requires real attention to keeping anything growing<br />from drying out. Now this building faces a green hill at Travers Park, not a chain link fence <br />so it&#039;s a smart time to upgrade.

				I&#039;m pretty sure this is the building I passed last week where they had a mattress (uncovered) with blood stains and bugs (bed?)crawling all over it on top of the garbage pile. I&#039;d be more concerned about an infestation than the landscaping!

				I think this is the time of year you start planning and planting bulbs. You would think I should know more because my mom landscaped the heck out of her home in a small town. I had exactly zero interest as a kid. And now that I see what a challenge it is for her to maintain as she ages, I know if I ever buy a home with real property, I&#039;m keeping the landscaping to what is easy, easy, easy to do.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18890.msg100412.html#msg100412">Quote from: JHMNY on July 20, 2020, 09:15:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Update on the landscaping project at this building.
