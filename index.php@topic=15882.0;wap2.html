			Hi all, <br /><br />Can you recommend a good local vet? I was happy to see that Noah&#039;s Ark is close to me, but they charge $95 for an exam, which seems REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE (our fancy vet in Park Slope was only $65). I&#039; prefer someone within walking distance, but I&#039;d rather travel to a good vet than have a mediocre local one. <br /><br />Thanks!

			I&#039;ve been to all the local vets and while I liked Dr. Tello, he is pricey. I do Not and would not recommend&nbsp; any of the northern blvd vet places. I&#039;ve been taking my fur babies to Heights animal hospital. We only like Dr. Rheile (make sure to check before making appointment). It is a no frills, not new or state of the art but I trust them. The staff have always been so sweet and caring.

			Thanks for the recommendations! (Hopefully we won&#039;t need a vet anytime soon, but it&#039;s good to have some vets in mind.)<br />
