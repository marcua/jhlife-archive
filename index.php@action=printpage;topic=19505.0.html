				Interesting article:<br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/renovation-work-begins-on-jackson-heights-heritage-tower<br /><br />When complete, this will be a really nice addition to 82nd st. I&#039;m so curious if this new owner is going to try to attract corporate tenants? Any thoughts?

				This building always reminds me of The Tower of Terror from Disney. When they are done renovating it I hope they dress it up during Halloween.

				this thing bummed me out as it was going up, and it continues to do so. i suppose it could attract something corporate, perhaps airline/travel related, given a general proximity to LGA.

				The problem with this building is not just that it&#039;s bombastic and out of character for the neighborhood but it is so ill-used, in particular, the parking garage.&nbsp; What would be great, In my&nbsp; opinion, is if the parking garage was repurposed as a YMCA or interior market like the new markets being created around the city.&nbsp; A place for small shops/vendors like the Essex Street Market (for example.)&nbsp; I always thought that there was so much potential for part of it to be a restaurant with an open air eating air where the parking space is now.&nbsp; There is all this wonderful space wasted on cars and not being used for people.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s not nearly as bad as the white monstosity across the street.&nbsp; The Heritage Tower kind of looks like a new version of one of the old buidings in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It is now covered with scaffolding from head to toe.&nbsp; Which reminds me......will the scaffolding on the building diagonal to The Heritage Tower ever be taken down?&nbsp; It is covering arguably one of the most beautiful buildings in the neighborhood and has been there (in some form) since I moved here 10 YEARS AGO!

				I attended a meeting in the building a couple years ago and was stunned by the shabbiness of the building interior.&nbsp; Hope the renovation works, but it will take a lot of money to make that building into something that will attract.&nbsp;

				A market in the parking area?&nbsp; That&#039;s a cool idea!! So creative. Kudos. <br /><br />Or the parking area used as a YMCA/gym could also be amazing. <br /><br />Does anyone know how to relay these interesting ideas to that developer or management company?

				Based on prior experience trying to influence/suggest to the owner/developer businesses people wanted to see in the Bruson Building--there is zero chance that this owner/developer has the slightest bit of interest in these ideas. Don&#039;t waste your time trying.

				&nbsp;Agreed. The Bruson building bruhaha was a waste of peoples time. It was an abuse, really, of public efforts. I think that getting on some kind of community board or planning committee or helping the folks at JHBG is a much more productive effort regarding neighborhood planning.

				Owner/developers are going to do what makes them the most money and unfortunately the kinds of venues that are good for business aren&#039;t usually what the community would like to see.&nbsp; Unless there&#039;s a bribe... er, tax abatement involved.

				This building is an overpriced office building in a area that needs moderately priced office space. The developers paid a mint and are spending money to try to move the building up market. All of the government offices will be wise to move to the Bruson building when their lease is up.

				at which point the owners of the Bruson Building will, quite correctly, hike rental prices drastically. and so it goes.
