Gury&#039;s is on the main road, so should have no issues attracting customers.

			I feel like by &quot;food court&quot; they probably mean a steam table - not a mixture of tenants. The sign says Bakery and Restaurant.

			I walked by tonight. The brand new shutters have already been heavily graffitied.<br />This is why we can&#039;t have nice things.
