				I think we&#039;ll stop, but we&#039;ve been using 34th Ave religiously every morning to get a walk in before starting our day.<br /><br />Along the walk we see it all, mask wearers, chin protectors, elbow protectors, hand accessories<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if anyone here who choses to walk along the 34th Ave &#039;path&#039; decides it&#039;s important enough to bring outside, put on their head, but not wear across their mouth and nose.<br /><br />And if you are one of those people, why would you do so along a path you&#039;re guaranteed to be close to people on, especially when you&#039;re panting like a dog on a run or zooming past on a bike?<br /><br />I figure since this is the internet your identity is relatively protected, and im genuinely interested in your POV.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />

				I just wanted to add an addendum, before the mob comes at me accusing me of being a bad person, that I always wear a mask on 37th Ave, for example...maybe a rare exception would be if I&#039;m strolling in the late evening and there literally is no one outside and I pull it down. And I always wear mask (and gloves) in stores. <br /><br />I&#039;m not foolish or irresponsible. But I do feel like 34th Ave is wide enough so I can responsibly avoid most people. If I&#039;m running, for example, at a peak time...I will go up into east Elmhurst, where I&#039;m guaranteed to see no one!

Large chunks of the day it&#039;s not difficult to keep more than 6 ft between yourself and others on 34th Avenue. When it&#039;s rainy or threatening rain out, it&#039;s even easier. I use a bandana or masks with a neck tether, so it&#039;s easy to put on when needed.

				The times I&#039;ve been on 34th it was impossible to maintain distance, and it&#039;s not like 6 feet is a silver bullet. Sure it reduces your risk. But if you&#039;re wandering around with people that aren&#039;t wearing one or wearing it in a manner that renders it useless, it&#039;s just too much risk IMO.<br /><br />Was everyone like NOT here for March and April being a living hell on first responders and hospital staff?

				If someone is following the rules, then they are being responsible. <br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s the rules that you should take issue with, not the individuals following them. Get on the phone with your elected officials and demand stricter rules if you don&#039;t think they are enough.

I think you should also know 34th Avenue isn&#039;t the only street in Jackson Heights, so when people talk about walking on blocks, you might want to try and and wrap your head around the idea that there are many, many, many blocks in Jackson Heights (and surrouding areas) that aren&#039;t heavily trafficked -- like most of East Elmhurst. In the future, rather than extrapolate what *you want to extrapolate* from someone&#039;s statements, you could try asking a question.<br /><br />I get it. You&#039;re one of those people to whom mask wearing has become a cargo cult. There&#039;s nothing irresponsible about going outdoors and removing your mask when there aren&#039;t other people around. If you think and feel differently, since you can&#039;t control anyone&#039;s actions but your own and the guidelines from the governor are that you must wear a face covering outside only when you can&#039;t maintain a safe distance from other, I would suggest you just not go outside until you convince NY State to adopt your standard.<br /><br />

If so, you might want to revisit the assumptions you&#039;re making. Masks pulled down under the chin can easily be pulled up. Ditto for bandannas and scarves. Some masks have neck tethers. I&#039;ve modified some washable masks with yarn or string to create a neck tether. It&#039;s really helpful so you can remove your mask when others aren&#039;t around (and allow it to dry out since respiration through a mask makes it damp, making it less effective, which is what you don&#039;t want when you go out for a walk in an area where it&#039;s easy to avoid proximity with others, and will also come to a place where you want to put it on, like 37th Avenue or a stop at store to run an errand).

				Not surprised this has turned ugly although it was intended to be an open discussion initially from the way I read it.&nbsp; Long before we were mandated to wear masks early in the recommendations, I was out one morning walking, no one else was out, I encountered a woman who was upset by my not wearing a mask even though we were about 12 feet apart.&nbsp; I started wearing a mask all the time when I am out, because I don&#039;t want to be THAT person.&nbsp; The one who makes anxious people more anxious.

I&#039;ve had pairs of runners throughout the neighborhood come up from behind me, split to get around me and both stay within a foot or two of me. That annoys me (and I think it would be rude behavior outside of an epidemic), but I also think the risk of infection from such an encounter is so low as to be negligible -- if that was a common transmission route I think 100% of New Yorkers tested would have antibodies. I suspect those people have the same perception as I do. <br /><br />My annoyance at that comes from the lack of consideration it shows to others who are fearful, not my fear of catching Covid-19.

				i think the phrase cargo cult is becoming your cargo cult.<br /><br />no one said not to wear a mask when you&#039;re alone and away from others, and have control over that circumstance.<br /><br />the bottom line is 34th street, unless you&#039;re out at 3PM, is an area designated for people to be out and walking. <br /><br />you don&#039;t have control. you may think you do. you might think it&#039;s ok. i&#039;m clearly not going to change your mind.

If you are comfortable with that. Some people have heightened anxiety, and they should keep their masks on if it makes them feel better. Of course what you mean is no one has said wear a mask when you&#039;re alone and away from others, but that&#039;s exactly what has been posted above. Wearing a face covering at all times when outside includes when you are outside, alone, and away from others<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the bottom line is 34th street, unless you&#039;re out at 3PM (sic), is an area designated for people to be out and walking.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So are sidewalks and parks. And let&#039;s keep in mind &quot;out&quot; for some people who aren&#039;t able to walk a lot means standing in place, sitting, and moving pretty slowly. They should be able to enjoy the outdoors just as much as the able bodied. Families should be able to let their kids learn how to ride a bike, draw with chalk, and play hopscotch in place.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to post photos from yesterday at noon on 34th Avenue where there are hardly any people on the street. I&#039;ve been unsuccessful at getting the file size small enough. (??) The perception that it&#039;s always chock-a-block just isn&#039;t reality. It definitely is heavily trafficked at some times of day, I agree, and that&#039;s why I think people like me who are able bodied, don&#039;t have kids with them, and out for physical activity would be wise to walk along the residential streets in less densely populated areas during those times.<br /><br />The bottom line really is, know what the rules are, which are that people only have to cover their faces outside when they can&#039;t keep a safe distance from others. (I get it, 6 feet isn&#039;t a certainty for safety. But we have to pick a number and 6 it is. We pick numbers all the time as a society you can argue over, like age of consent, a speed limit, etc.) The other bottom line is that people are clearly garbage at judging what 6 feet looks like, and other people don&#039;t care about wearing the mask. We should control what we can control, which is ourselves.<br /><br />I&#039;m not insensitive to the fear. I lost someone, and I was ill. I was very scared to venture outdoors for a bit -- out of fear that even though I followed the quarantine guidelines, the recommendations have been wrong in the past so what if they were wrong about the timeline and I was still infectious? So I erred on the side of caution and quarantined longer than the recommendation from the CDC.

				I never wear a mask in public, unless required by a store. The most current immunological and serological medical research completed by the SWISS POLICY REASEARCH&nbsp; center states that there is a 0.1% lethality rate for COVID, same as a strong seasonal influenza.

				The Covid-19 mortality rate is much higher than that of influenza. The influenza numbers are inflated with projections. In a typical influenza season in the United States confirmed deaths range between 10,000 and 20,000.&nbsp; The higher numbers you&#039;ve read about are projections based on the death rate during the flu season versus the death rate the rest of the year. The 118,000 current deaths reported in the US are confirmed Covid-19 tested deaths.&nbsp; This is in 3 months versus the year long total of 10,000 to 20,000 for the last two flu seasons.<br />Compare apples to apples.

				For anyone who&#039;s interested, Gothamist added a lot of new information/statistics to their Coronavirus tracker.<br />https://gothamist.com/news/coronavirus-statistics-tracking-epidemic-new-york<br /><br />Probably the most interesting chart that I hadn&#039;t seen was this updated map, that tracks new cases, by neighborhood, just for the past 2 weeks (versus culmulative). <br />https://covidinteractivesny.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/new_cases_map.html<br /><br />Jackson Heights (11372) reported 79 new cases over the span of the past 2 weeks. <br /><br />Given where we were in April, we&#039;ve come a long way!&nbsp;

				My mother died of COVID-19 and I&#039;m immunocompromised (among them chronic respiratory probs, and yet I survive wearing a mask).&nbsp; Going outdoors among an antipathetic populace who are unable to put a little something on for their travels, with runners and cyclers passing close from the side, has made it a situation for me to get prescriptions, visit doctors etc.&nbsp; It shouldn&#039;t have to be, just as Mom didn&#039;t have to die, and our numbers would be so much lower if only these did the right thing and thought about others.&nbsp; But of course, unless someone drops dead right there it won&#039;t happen :(<br /><br />It is a social thing, a vanity thing. They are embarrassed. Are doctors embarrassed too? It is an illusion&nbsp; to feel better about themselves without thinking of consequences they have no control over. <br /><br />Here is what I saw:<br /><br />I was in a takeout place last week and some large character with a chin guard stepped out with his purchase. On the sidewalk he ran into an acquaintance: a younger, smaller guy in a mask. The moment they chatted the younger guy pulled his mask below his nose. By the end of 2 minutes they went separate ways, only this time both were wearing chin guards.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be nice not to wear a mask? Some people can&#039;t wear anything anymore - ever again. People every day in this city are diagnosed. And let&#039;s not forget where COVID-19 activity has been most prevalent: here. Corona, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst...<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell me you&#039;re sorry for my Mother&#039;s death. It would be disingenuous and not the point anyway.

				I see very few people not wearing masks outside where it&#039;s not possible to maintain a fair distance from others, or in stores. What I do see A LOT of is people wearing masks incorrectly, like below their noses. Apparently they don&#039;t think their nostrils are used to inhale and exhale? I don&#039;t get it. It demonstrates a flagrant disregard for those around you. Especially the workers at the stores.<br /><br />I lost someone to Covid, but I&#039;m pretty sure that person&#039;s exposure came before we all got the guidance about wearing masks even if we weren&#039;t actively sick. So, as angry as I am, I&#039;m not really angry at any particular individual who may have spread the illness. But we know better now, so I do get angry at people who can&#039;t find a mask that covers their nose. Maybe stop buying them from the dollar store FPS.

				Part of it that makes me a little angry is people in my building that don&#039;t wear their mask until they get outside. It&#039;s WAY MORE LIKELY that you will transmit your asymptomatic infection to others in the common closed area of the building than outside. I think most research puts it at 20x more likely to spread the virus to others indoors than outside. Especially since it&#039;s been proven to hang in the air for a long time indoors. Obviously this doesn&#039;t mean its a good idea to be shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of people yelling and screaming outside, or talking to someone close by for a long period if they might be infected.<br /><br />We&#039;ve done so well so far, I&#039;d hate to see people losing it and being less cautious and starting this problem up all over again by not maintaining disclipline of WEARING A DAMN MASK. It&#039;s NOT HARD and it&#039;s NOT HARMFUL TO YOU. Suck it up and show the least amount of caring for others in the community.

				This thread is so huge now... trying to summarize...<br /><br />- Even crappy masks make it harder to spread. So everyone should at least be wearing crappy masks when outside their home.<br /><br />- Crappy masks don&#039;t protect you from catching it (very much), but an N95 mask (or R95, P95, KN95, KF94, P2, etc) will help you from catching it, even if nobody else is wearing masks. You can find some of these on eBay.<br /><br />- The virus can hang around in the air for a while (or be sucked through the air by air conditioning or fans), even after the spreader has left. <br /><br />- Avoid all indoor and underground spaces when possible.<br /><br />- Open multiple windows if you are in a car.<br /><br />- If you live in an apartment, consider blocking the bottom of your front door so that air from the hallway can&#039;t enter your apartment.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Lose weight if you are overweight. Besides affecting older people more, the virus also affects higher BMI more.

Like most everything in life, there&#039;s a risk. We could reduce fatalities on the interstate highways by reducing the speed limit to 35 mph, but then you have to weight the impact on the economy, people&#039;s time, etc. We could require restaurants to only serve hard cooked eggs to even further reduce the risk of food borne illnesses undercooked eggs, but for most people a bad egg is probably just going to give you at worst, a bad case of a stomach bug and who wants overly cooked eggs all the time for that?<br /><br />Wearing a face cover is kind of a minor inconvenience I think in light of how much it can reduce the transmission of a easily contracted respiratory illness. I sorely wish the guidance to wear a face covering had come about a month earlier than it did.

				I find all of the masks uncomfortable and inconvenient. They make my nose run and make it hard to breathe especially if I&#039;m exerting myself at all. Nevertheless, I where them whenever I&#039;m in public outside my home or car.<br />I have to discard the surgical masks after each use. The KN95 masks I wear only when a crowded indoor environment, like shopping and might be able to wear for a couple of days an hour at a time, but these are the most uncomfortable. The cloth mask is the most comfortable and probably the least effective but I have made the cloth masks a little more effective by inserting a piece of a Filtrete virus and allergen filter that is supposed to be more than 99% effective, but of course it&#039;s still behind cloth which can absorb particles.&nbsp; The cloth masks can be washed but some of them are cheaply made and will be less effective with each washing. Hand washing works best for me.

From a quick search on the internet...<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Healthy people use both their nose and their mouth to breathe. Breathing through the mouth only becomes necessary when you have nasal congestion due to allergies or a cold. Also, when you are exercising strenuously, mouth breathing can help get oxygen to your muscles faster.<br /><br />-------------------------------------

Otherwise you risk contaminating your hands, and then contaminating anything else you touch. Unless people are washing their hands everytime they touch their mask, then it is risky to keep adjusting it.<br /><br />This also makes even outdoor dining risky eg many people might not realise that they need to wash their hands again *after* taking off their mask to eat.

You wear the mask to protect others, not so much for yourself. You are protected by others wearing masks. You wash your hands often because you know others (and yourself) aren&#039;t perfect. <br /><br />I went on a hike today. Put a mask on to exit my apartment. Once I got outside I removed the mask. Drove up to a park and had the mask at the ready should any other hikers get close (as happens on narrow trails on a beautiful weekend day). Took it on and off a number of times throughout the day as I crossed paths with hikers on the trail, to eat, to drink. Drove to a town to get a bite to eat. Mask off in the car, on as I entered the establishment, off at the table, on to use the restroom, off back at the table, on to exit the establishment, off back in the car. On again to enter the apartment building.<br /><br />I suppose I could have worn a mask for 8 solid hours, but since I wasn&#039;t close to anyone during most of that time, and what we are learning is that surface contamination isn&#039;t as big a risk as we worried a couple of months ago, it&#039;s just not very practical. The greatest risk seems to be enclosed spaces with others, which is why even when I&#039;m upstate, I&#039;m still avoiding indoor dining.

The vitriol has been pretty bad at times and during the early grieving process it was really hurtful. I try to remember now that most folks acting that way were operating out of fear and stress.

				Agreed. <br /><br />From Cuomo&#039;s perspective (living in Westchester and working in Albany), the rule probably makes more sense to him.<br /><br />E.g. Maybe Cuomo really does walk down empty streets quite often, and can see other people coming from a mile away. <br /><br />But it doesn&#039;t make sense in NYC to take off your mask outside. And especially not in Jackson Heights, which is one of the densest areas in NYC.

Especially if you head on over north of Northern Blvd, where the neighborhood isn&#039;t quite as dense. I do it for at least an hour every day - morning, noon and evening. Many of the sidewalks actually are wide enough to do it, and when you see a group of people coming, you either put your mask on or on a residential street with light traffic, you can step out on to the street to let people pass. I can see why some people wouldn&#039;t be comfortable with doing that (I am though). Most people are decent and will move over to their respective edge of the sidewalk to make the space, though some don&#039;t.<br /><br />Every neighborhood in New York City does not look like the streets leading towards Penn Station M-F, 6 pm.

				i&#039;ve wondered aloud about the table spacing as well. the rule is several feet of spacing between tables, but virtually every restaurant on 37th has tables so close together that people in separate parties are touching chairs. yes, i know &quot;they can&#039;t space things out more.&quot; but is that really an excuse to create a dangerous situation?

				I would not eat on Northern for reasons just articulated here. On the other hand, we just ate outside of Bistro Eloise.&nbsp; Plenty of space between the tables.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some kind of bamboo-like fence enclosed us.&nbsp; Most people didn&#039;t wear masks, but there was enough distance for us to feel comfortable.Very pleasant experience, even though we were in the corner of a shopping mall.

				^My understanding is that the rule is that diners can remove their masks at their table, but need to put them on to get up, use the restroom, upon leaving their table for anything. Servers are supposed to wear their masks at all times. We put on our masks while the server is taking our order, placing plates, etc.<br /><br />Bistro Eloise has the spacing of the tables right. They might even have more seats outside than in their dining room Plaka, the Greek place next door, well it felt a little tight to me.
