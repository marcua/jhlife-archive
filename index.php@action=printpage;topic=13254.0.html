				I noticed some green markings on the sidewalks on 75th Street between 37th Road and 37th Ave a while back similar to the markings that are made on the sidewalks when a street tree is going to be planted. They&#039;ve mostly faded over the winter however, I more recently noticed some patched concrete in those areas. Now there are several green markings on the sidewalks on 76th between 37th and 35th Aves. I think we may be seeing some bioswales in these areas soon. This brochure details the process which seems to match what I&#039;ve observed: http://on.nyc.gov/144I79E (http://on.nyc.gov/144I79E)<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed these anywhere or have any additional information?<br /><br />If this is what is happening, I think this is great. Anything that adds more green space to JH and reduces water pollution is more than welcome.<br /><br />(http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/images/features_centercolumn_lg/feature_gi_handout_new2.jpg)<br /><br />(http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/images/features_centercolumn_lg/feature_gi_home.jpg)<br /><br />

				JHBG’s street-tree volunteers have worked on 180 trees on 37th Avenue since April, covering almost every block from 69th Street to Junction Boulevard. Today we focused on 80th to 84th Streets<br /><br />The work entails loosening rock-hard soil to permit water to penetrate to roots, sometimes adding compost and then covering with wood-chip mulch, which keeps moisture in and weeds out.<br /><br />And for those who did not make it out to the event, here’s the answer to those mysterious green, purple and orange scribblings along many curbs in Jackson Heights... They are markings for potential sites for BIOSWALES (little bits of of nature in NYC that absorb rainwater and dramatically reduce pollution in NYC’s rivers, bays and other bodies of water.<br /><br />Check out this story on the city’s bioswale plans: http://gothamist.com/2014/11/10/bioswales.php

				Merchants along 37th Avenue can certainly help. Please water the existing trees near your shops.<br />Trees need about 17 gallons of water each week. Preferably delivered very slowly by hose or bucket so it doesn’t run off, twice a week. This is especially important for young trees, those planted in the thrtee-four years. These tree don’t have well established root systems to absorb enough water.<br /><br />It’s often helpful to break up the soil so it will absorb the water faster, otherwise the water can runoff without reaching the roots.<br />Water that runs off doesn’t count toward the 17 gallons<br /><br />Residents can do the same thing.<br /><br />If you want to do it formally you can adopt a tree with NYC Parks. This does not carry any legal responsibility.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;This great news and I know JHBG has been asking for these for some time. Can we capitalize on the enthusiasm <br />and make sure they are maintained? The bioswales in Rego Park from a couple of years ago now look pretty sad<br />and overgrown. Volunteers anyone?

				The bioswales are probably going to be installed next year. They’ve been had those white machines that look like Zambonis all over JH the last few months drilling into the ground to determine how well the soil absorbs water. If it absorbs water well and the site is free of underground&nbsp; infrastructure they most likely will install the bioswale. For those who don’t know, bioswales are a super-powered tree pit designed to take a lot of the rain water that otherwise goes down sewers often overloading sewage treatment plants resulting in untreated sewage going into nearby waterways. City is required by court order to do this because it doesnt’ comply with federal clean water rules. City opted for green infrastructure because it’s less expensive than sewage treatment plants which are very hard to find acceptable locations for. They are very cool and as Itsit and Sarah noted coming to JH in pretty good numbers.

				The bioswales are maintained by the Parks department.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link (http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/cso_long_term_control_plan/index.shtml) if you&#039;re interested in the DEP&#039;s Long Term Control Plans for CSOs. There are nine for specific water bodies and one for open waters.

				&nbsp;The idea is fantastic but they are not maintained in Rego Park where they have been for two years. Parks needs<br />more staff for this level of green in the community. We need to ask our representatives to make sure that projects<br />like this are not just installed but are funded for long lasting maintainence and Parks gets that help they need.

				&nbsp;Thanks Todd, as those are some cool graphics and points of info. But the bioswales I mention being neglected in Rego Park<br />are around a shopping center and municipal building and parking lot and they really look like hell at the moment. What<br />exactly is the committment with the community in maintainence where no one lives and commercial establishments think<br />this is the city&#039;s job? Think this point needs to be figured out before this excellent project goes further.

				itsit, I haven&#039;t been over there recently.&nbsp; Do the bioswales look worse than ordinary tree pits would -- if they were to suffer from the same level of neglect?&nbsp; And businesses are responsible for maintaining their sidewalks, so why let them off the hook for this?&nbsp; &nbsp;If their neglect bothers you, I suggest telling them so.&nbsp; &nbsp;Certainly here in Jackson Heights, we have a lot of businesses along 37th Avenue that take pride in helping maintain their tree pits, and JHBG works hard at it too, so I&#039;m not sure that we should worry that the bioswales will be a problem.<br /><br />(This is off-topic, but I&#039;ve been wondering about your name.&nbsp; Are you a fan of SF Bay Area ice cream sandwiches (http://www.itsiticecream.com/)?)

				&nbsp;Todd, the bioswales in Rego Park do look worse than tree pits and the reason I keep bringing up maintainence is that<br />we can&#039;t keep expecting our volunteers to do that work. JHBG is a fantastic group of volunteers and we should cherish<br />them <span class="bbc_u">but</span> they can&#039;t be the support staff for public projects that get installed and left in our community maybe <br />like the Bioswales. Jeffsayyes pointed out in another thread that people should complain if they see public situations <br />that need attention. Squeeky wheel syndrome works in NYC. We need to let parks know from the onset that we like <br />the idea very much and are also interested in their program for maintainence.<br />&nbsp; Let&#039;s get the bioswales installed, happily, but it can&#039;t be all volunteer from that point on. I see parks workers in other <br />areas of the city much more frequently that I do here in JH.<br /><br />Yes- love those cookie/ice cream combos from San Francisco!

				I have to agree with itsit on this. I rarely see a tree pit that is looked after properly. This morning, I cleaned the ones outside of Starbucks and the rest of that block. At home I&#039;ve had countless arguments with dog walkers who feel it is there right to walk their dogs on plantings in the tree pits. I think some sort of public announcement/ education is needed for store owners and residents alike regarding this. Ps I love the idea but a maintanince&nbsp; plan is called for.

				madalyn, when my ex and i owned a house on 75th, we had a tree planted and got a gingko, which was recommended by the city rep. there are a lot of new gingkos here because a) they tend to grow straight up, not out over streets, and b) they are super super resilient.<br /><br />that said, i do wish people would be more careful -- i never actually see anyone throw trash into the pits but it ends up there somehow!

				&nbsp;Same but different subject is the two-foot high grasses on Northern Blvd where the crossings (wonderful idea)<br />have been placed. This press on these was intense but after the fuss goes away who cuts the weeds and <br />maintains the stuff? Sunnyside got a big grant for tree guards a couple years ago and put in tons of flimsy<br />tree guards many of which are now mangled and broken in weedy tree pits. These publicly funded projects<br />need serious maintainence plans. Bring back the Civilian Conservation Corps or some kind of plan please!
