					Are we STILL eating cheese in 2020? <br /><br />You realize milk from other animals are from MOTHERS and the MILK is for their BABIES... right?<br /><br />Those babies are forced to wear anti-suckling devices that hurt the mother whenever the baby tries to suckle. All because YOU want to eat cheese.<br /><br />Babies are then either bred to be cow-producing &quot;mothers&quot; themselves, or shipped to veal farms. Google it. Enlighten yourselves. I have nothing good to say about cheese in 2020. Wake up, sheeple.<br /><br /><strong>Mod note: topic split from one discussing a JH store</strong>

					Tonight as I was walking home along 37th Avenue, I noticed a cop car was parked in the pedestrian crosswalk on the corner of 37th Ave/83rd Street. It was blocking traffic on one side and blocking the sidewalk curb ramp for wheelchairs and strollers.<br /><br />At first I thought there was an emergency since the car was parked so strangely and without a care. But then I saw two female officers in Cafe de Colombia drinking coffee and eating cake.<br /><br />I was livid. I stayed by the cop car and took pictures and then called 311 to make a report. The 311 rep. took down my details but I received the typical &quot;case closed&quot; email less than an hour later. <br /><br />I watched as elderly pedestrians tried to navigate across 37th Avenue with that cop car parked directly where it SHOULDN&#039;T be.<br /><br />Can someone please tell me who else I can go to about this issue? This is NOT the first time this has happened. It is arrogant, self-indulgent and dangerous.<br /><br />Photos here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pfsl8UA" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/pfsl8UA</a><br />

					Hi all --<br /><br />I&#039;ve been asking around the neighborhood for a language program for my 2yr old and 5yr old but everyone is pointing me to Manhattan! <br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s a Chinese/Spanish/French program in Jackson Heights (or close by) on the weekend? Preferably Saturday but Sunday afternoon is ok as well.<br /><br />I&#039;m open to all languages for my kids but would LOVE a Chinese program (kids will be learning Spanish in school anyway).<br /><br />If anyone knows of any, please let me know here!

					Yesterday morning I was waiting outside Caffe Bene for my co-worker when I saw a truck pull up in front of La Boina Roja Steakhouse. The driver got out, went around to the other side of his truck, and when he opened the door, three pieces of meat fell out into the drainway.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever seen the drains of this neighborhood, they are filled with filth.<br /><br />What this truck driver did afterwards has just blown my brain.<br /><br />He bent down, picked up the pieces of meat from the ground and returned them to his truck.<br /><br />PHOTOS HERE: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/eCfpIZN" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/eCfpIZN</a><br /><br />If you&#039;ve ever eaten at La Boina Roja, please please please beware. Your meat is not being handled sanitary. This truck driver left the meat in the drain for close to 2 minutes before he packed it back in his truck.<br /><br />I had to leave for work so I couldn&#039;t stay much longer to see what happened, but if this is what they get away with in PUBLIC, imagine what&#039;s going on in the KITCHEN. Utterly disgusted.

					Whether you love charter schools or despise the privatization of education, one thing many of us can agree on is that the U.S. education system is failing many of our kids. And opening charter schools is just a small way of taking action against a failing system.<br /><br />We have Renaissance Charter School on 81st Street which has been a great success, but this school only holds 550-odd students. What about the other children in our neighborhood? <br /><br />Before summer vacation, my niece, who is a 5th grader, told me that her teacher couldn&#039;t explain fractions to her even though the class was being &quot;taught&quot; them... because why put effort into teaching?&nbsp; <img src="Smileys/default/angry.gif" alt="&gt;&#58;&#40;" title="Angry" class="smiley" /> I ended up tutoring my 5th grade niece to make up for her teacher&#039;s lack of knowledge.<br /><br />I know not all public schools are run like this. I know a lot of successful public schools where administrators really care for their students and encourage them in every way. But, we still have ELA and Math scores that only just make the grade. We can do better!<br /><br />I want to know if anyone in JH is interested in forming a group to discuss the idea of starting a charter school. Either located in JH or surrounding areas (District 30 or 24). My dream is to start a STEM charter school for girls but I am open to all ideas to get our neighborhood kids into better high schools and onto great colleges.<br /><br />Thoughts? Complaints? Want to form a group and get coffee so we can discuss?

					Today my mother was standing outside of Fillmore Hall waiting for her friend when the super ( or I assume the super) came out of the apartment building telling her she was standing on private property. He became incredibly aggressive for no reason, told her she was standing on private property, gave her the finger, said &quot;fuck you&quot; and walked inside. My mother took out her phone and then the super returned with his phone, charged towards her screaming &quot;take your glasses off, take your glasses off&quot; and got up into her face as she recorded him.<br /><br />Can someone please tell me how I can get in touch with Fillmore Hall management to report this? I went online but only found a number for the estate agency.

					Since moving to JH over 6 years ago, I&#039;ve had to adjust the way I cross the road (in the pedestrian crosswalk). Even though the lights say I can walk, I&#039;m constantly looking around for that one car whose driver doesn&#039;t want to wait for people walking. And I&#039;m constantly fed up with pedestrians not crossing when they&#039;re able to, simply because they think they have to wait for a car that&#039;s making a turn as fast as they can.<br /><br />Tonight my BF was almost hit by a young girl driving recklessly -- she made a turn into the crosswalk and only missed him because I pulled him back. I took down her license plate and called 311 to report to the Police, but what else can we do here?<br /><br />I&#039;m so sick and tired of reckless drivers. I&#039;m sick of having to speed up my walking or jump out of the way of oncoming vehicles, even when it is MY turn to walk across the road. <br /><br />Does anyone else have this problem?!
