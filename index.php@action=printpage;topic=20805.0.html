				&nbsp;Is there any way to find out how Jackson Heights is doing right now with Covid positives, testing or any other measures? Asking because it seems like our vaxx rate was pretty high along with awareness of Covid spread.

But things are changing so rapidly that the info you see there might already be outdated. For example, the map right now shows 11372 at 5.37% positivity rate (7 day average, Dec. 10-16). BUT since there&#039;s a lag in reporting, I am guessing that number has already gone way up. Also don&#039;t forget that currently we have a lot of people using the at-home rapid tests whose results wouldn&#039;t be reported at all.<br />https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#maps<br /><br />I think a more accurate rate to look at would be hospitalizations for Covid, and not including people who test positive when they go to the hospital for another condition. I&#039;m not sure those numbers are available.

				&nbsp;Yes, I have been looking at that data and have been skeptical of its accuracy. It&#039;s hard to believe that at any recent time, 99% of this community was vaccinated for anything, much less Covid. However, this is listed as site of government statistics...any place else that feels like a better read&nbsp; like the suggestion about hospitalizations?

				If you have a Twitter account, you can create a list of accounts of Covid experts and epidemiologists. Or just find a list that someone else has already created and follow their list.<br />You can start with some of these accounts:<br /><br />https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden<br />https://twitter.com/MackayIM<br />https://twitter.com/PeterHotez<br />https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett<br />https://twitter.com/mugecevik<br />https://twitter.com/DrEricDing<br />https://twitter.com/ashishkjha<br /><br />If you start a list like that, Twitter will suggest other similar accounts to follow.<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to be interested in tweeting to have a Twitter account. It&#039;s actually a good way to follow certain types of news you&#039;re interested in, even if you have no intention of tweeting yourself.<br />

				My other advice if you&#039;re looking to protect yourself is to get a great mask that fits you. If you want to try out different kinds, there&#039;s something called the N95 Project. https://www.projectn95.org/<br /><br />I also read a bunch of advice from various people and ended up with this one, a KF94 in large https://www.amazon.com/BOTN-Protective-Safety-4-Layer-Adjustable/dp/B0947MJHFC<br />It seems pretty good and gets good reviews but I&#039;m not an expert :)

				One more suggestion - if you&#039;re looking for a home testing kit and can&#039;t find one to purchase anywhere, I read they are supposed to be giving out the home test kits at every NYC testing site. You can find the list here https://twitter.com/votejgr/status/1472965042563952642?s=20<br /><br />Check the poster - but there&#039;s one on 37th Ave and 104th St., one at NYCHA Woodside on Newtown Ave, and on Wed. only there&#039;s a pop up at the Queens Museum. What&#039;s unclear is if you have to wait on the same long lines if you only just want to pick up a home test.

				Hi folks, I went to get tested this morning at Elmhurst Hospital (corner of 77 &amp; Broadway) and they were handing out Binax rapid tests to folks in line. If you just need a rapid test (which are hard to find in pharmacies these days) and not a PCR, this is a good option.
