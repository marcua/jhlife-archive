			If you have been missing Armondo&#039;s, they are back! It looks like they are putting some real effort into the outdoor space and we are hoping to partake soon. Nice to see them rally and I hope the community can support them- and the many other outdoor spaces along Northern Blvd.- who are also making the big effort here. Mojito&#039;s will be right after Armondo&#039;s on the list...

			That&#039;s great to hear. Armondo&#039;s has been a favorite since i moved to the neighborhood 25 years ago. the food is really solid and Jerry is a wonderful host.

			I had always considered Mojitos a &quot;bar&quot; only, but given what they are doing with their outside seating on the side street, I may give them a try in the early evening. Las Margaritas is another place I may try now. I never went in there because of how LOUD it always was, but the outdoor dining they are doing seems to allow for a quieter experience.

			Las Margaritas is (or was, haven&#039;t been in a couple of years) best for drinks and apps in my experience. and holy smoke, it is loud inside. used to go on sundays with a former roommate who was a huge sports fan.
