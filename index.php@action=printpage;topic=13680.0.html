				This could have been any of our wives or daughters... We need to have more police patrolling the streets in order to deter this type of disgusting behavior. How can a woman feel safe in this neighborhood when they constantly hear news like this.

				I hope they do catch him.&nbsp; It&#039;s incredibly scary and something I worry about coming home at night.&nbsp; After 37 th it gets very desolate and dark on the side streets. Not to mention I&#039;ve had men follow me. It is why I walk on guard a lot.&nbsp; What an awful thing.

				I hate being a fear mongerer, but awful incidents like this one remind us how we need to stay vigilant. One thing I&#039;d suggest is to be careful about using headphones and ear buds, especially when walking alone. It reduces your ability to hear in your environment (e.g. if someone comes up behind you), which in turn can impact your safety. <br /><br />It&#039;s no guarantee, of course, but anything you can do to keep safe is a plus.

				well, the springtime spike in crime merited eleven front page stories in each of the tabloids, the subsequent drop, one paragraph on page 29.

				Hi all, as a woman living near this terrible incident, I am now scared to walk in the streets around my home. I think we should act to make our neighborhood safer and demand more security in the streets as well as more lighting in the streets beyond 37th. Please lets act together by calling our congressman Joseph Crowley whose office is located right next to where the rape occurred at 82-11 37th Ave. His office number for constituents is (718) 779-1400. Also please let&#039;s call City Council Member Daniel Dromm at 718-803-6373&nbsp; (he has been giving out flyers on this issue but we need further action!) Would appreciate your further thoughts on this!

				Obviously it&#039;s a horrible thing that happened, but this is something that can and does happen anywhere/anytime. You shouldn&#039;t let an isolated incident stop you from living your life.<br /><br />It&#039;s NYC, be aware of your surroundings and take safety precautions. A woman should never be walking alone at 4:30am in the dark... sometimes it&#039;s worth the $10 for a cab.

Reality is, this can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights for my entire life and have always felt safe - this is just a reminder that you can never let your guard down. Always be vigilant and alert no matter where you are.

(Who doesn&#039;t have women in their lives?) But also care about it because they are human beings, and it doesn&#039;t matter whether you know her or not, or whether you have a wife or daughter.

				When you put this rape alongside the forcible touching that happened in this neighborhood a few weeks before, it is disturbing.&nbsp; If I was a woman I would certainly be wary walking home at night.&nbsp; But I guess that goes for most of the city.&nbsp; Not too long ago a bakery worker was raped in the heart of park slope in the early morning hours.&nbsp; Terrible, and I guess it goes to show it happens in all sorts of neighborhoods.
