				Good luck on a crowded 7 train to get there.<br />For the LIRR from Penn, are they increasing frequency?<br />And dedicating trains to only do the Penn/Willets Point return trip?<br /><br />It&#039;s equally as convoluted as the Newark airtrain. That doesn&#039;t run to Penn Station Newark (why not?)...and so after catching the Path... you are forced to take a NJ train one stop and then transfer to the airtrain. 3 different trains to get to Newark Airport from Manhattan. <br />

				How often do LIRR trains run? I imagine that might be the deciding factor whether someone hops on an LIRR train vs a 7 train, which come every few minutes. Although, if you have to wait 15 minutes for an LIRR and taking it shaves 15 minutes off the trip to Willets from Manhattan (vs. 7 train) then you&#039;re breaking even.

				&nbsp; That could be some &quot;wrong-way&quot; thinking. Stay tuned for the next installment of where the money goes in the neighborhood. An indoor community center, the likes of which would be available in winter months like the next 5-6 ahead of us, and a pool please along with a senior center/youth center/babies and nursery meetup. Rooftop running track for abled and less abled residents along with meal services for those in need and a CSA area. Job training too!<br />&nbsp; All of the above are either unrepresented groups or in areas with struggling conditions here in Jackson Heights. Most of our resources in the community continue to be focused around the 10 and under population. This is welcome but spread out some of the largess because you will find big kids - and the rest of us- also could use some improved circumstances.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone out there is listening above the static and that&#039;s why people bother to speak out. Use all channels right?

				&nbsp;Wow, do you think Danny Dromm did this on his own? Many, many people here in JH have been asking for a community center for decades. But the funds were low in the city and parks upgrades were all that were on the docket - three in the past some years in the younger kids section of Travers Park- and no feasible budget cuts in sight. So hooray for Danny getting this through but also kudos to anyone and everyone who kept this issue on the list for so many years. Visibility is important.<br /><br />And the last thing in JH that will ever be fixed is the Travers Park basketball court because teenagers don&#039;t usually know how to advocate for change with politicians.

				In the 1930&#039;s, they could build an EL SUBWAY TRAIN line in a year.<br /><br />I believe there is talk of building one on Central Parkway/Astoria Bld. to LGA from the Astoria Bld. stop on 31st St, Astoria.<br /><br />i think it&#039;s a great idea to have an EL TRAIN spur from the N/W which runs there... to LGA.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yes. That&#039;s true.<br /><br />I would imagine that the elevated subway be built in the middle of Grand Central Parkway.
