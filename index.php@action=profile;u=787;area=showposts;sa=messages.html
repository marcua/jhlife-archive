					a laptop that is put to the use such as being a desktop replacement, travel, carried around from room to room, constantly plugged in, etc... has an average lifespan of 3-4 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />in my opinion, it is cheaper and more cost effective to replace the entire unit. i just picked up a HP pavilion dv4 model line for about $500 (black friday).&nbsp; laptops go on sale all the time due to the constant model changes, they normally have a market lifespan of 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; with that said i hardly go after the expensive laptops since its pointless. here is the reason:<br /><br />-a larger hard drive is the main reason for the extra pennies. i solve this issue with a portable external drive (500gig, which is more that any laptop can offer)<br /><br />-screen size. i have a 14 inch screen since it is the perfect size for me since i travel.&nbsp; i also have a desktop. <br /><br />as mentioned i dont really see a point in spending 250-350 on laptop repairs since a new model is not that much more considering all the new technology.&nbsp; <br /><br />here are some tips so your laptop can have a longer lifespan:<br />-if using as a desktop replacement, leave the screen opened. flipping the screen up and down will cause screen failure<br />-store files on an external harddrive. this keeps your unit running free and fast plus it is less likely to lose files<br />-buy and use a laptop fan ($40 for a really good one). this keeps your laptop from running too hot<br />-avoid smothering the vents<br /><br />also you can donate your laptop for a tax break... <br />

					these are very similair to the &quot;hot houses&quot; in corona.&nbsp; these are mainly goods that &quot;fell off the truck&quot; and conveniently ended up for resale.&nbsp; this operation really hurts retailers in many ways.&nbsp; we all had shopping experiences with clothing stores like the gap, banana republic, j crew, etc... and i am sure we noticed the stiffer return policy that they offer.&nbsp; this is all due to large returns/exchanges without a purchase receipt.&nbsp; <br /><br />a location that sells name brand clothing at a cheaper price seems like a bargain that we can&#039;t overlook. but keep in mind that these locations will frequently change and move without any notice.&nbsp; also, it may seem exciting and all but understand that these &quot;business&#039;&quot; are frequently raided by the authorities and any &quot;consumer&quot;&nbsp; and spectator are considered a &quot;buyer of stolen goods&quot;. <br /><br />some may think: &quot;how can a small shop selling Gap clothing hurt an empire like Gap Inc.?&quot; <br /><br />the answer is simple, if you recall there was a Gap location in Flushing. that location closed due to the heavy exchanges and returns of &quot;stolen goods&quot; and high volume of stolen merchandise.&nbsp; being that it is so close to corona and jh where majority of these &quot;hot houses&quot; are located it greatly affected the everyday business of that particular Gap location. <br /><br />

					if im driving around the lower manhattan/soho area i will either take the williamsburg (more direct) or manhattan bridge that connects to the BQE (northern blvd exit for me).&nbsp; i think thats the fastest way possible around 8-10 miles.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />you can direct them to the 59th street bridge but make sure they take the lower level or you will end up on the other side on queens blvd.&nbsp; <br /><br />avoid the tunnels due to tolls.

					from my understanding about gas stations, it is required that tanks are to be changed (not sure about the timeframe).&nbsp; most of the time the they will reopen with a &quot;new age&quot; mobile station.&nbsp; it&#039;s a prime location for any type of business that will be established there.

					did possums move into JH recently?&nbsp; i never noticed possums in JH until this summer.&nbsp; i was working on my car late one night (beginning of the summer) and i heard something, i looked over and it was a possum.&nbsp; just this past weekend i saw another possum in hanging out in my backyard.&nbsp; <br /><br />i do know that possums populate the flushing/kissena park area and other more quiet surburban neighborhoods but i had no idea that they moved into JH.&nbsp;

					hello neighbors,<br /><br />before i call 311 for the first time i was wondering if anyone here has any experience with over grown wild trees?&nbsp; my next door neighbor has a tree that started growing right next to his garage.&nbsp; at first (approx 10 years ago), it was a tiny tree that did no harm.&nbsp; nowday, the tree trunk is doubled the size of an aluminum garbage can and the height is well into the 2nd floor of the houses.&nbsp; <br /><br />my main question and concern is that the tree is now clogging the gutters of my house and garage.&nbsp; i trimmed the branches that hung over my property line with a professional grade branch remover/cutter that i had to buy just for this matter.&nbsp; on top of clogged gutters, i notice certain areas on my backyard is has lifted due to the growing roots.&nbsp; <br /><br />on a normal circumstance, i will ring on the doorbell of my neighbor and address my concern but the landlord does not live on the property.&nbsp; the tenants that do, hardly speak english we hardly see each other.&nbsp; to be honest, i have no idea who and how the landlord looks like.&nbsp; <br /><br />i know i can call 311 and address this issue but i am sure that they will tell me to contact the property owner since its on private grounds.&nbsp; what are my options? <br /><br />also, i want to add that i love trees and anything that will promote our environment but in this particular circumstance. the tree is becoming a hardzard and inconvenience.&nbsp; imagine have clogged gutters, leaves on everything you own, consist sweeping, worrying about falling branches etc... <br /><br /><br />thanks for the help

					if i remember corrctly, there are different types of school buses.&nbsp; the public bus are the ones that will leave if you&#039;re not outside waiting and the private buses are the ones that will wait for you.&nbsp; being that you pay for private bus service they will wait a certain amount of time for the student.<br /><br />when i was a kid, i took a public school bus for a short period of time.&nbsp; the bus did not make any house stops but had&nbsp; frequent stops (every few blocks) on 32nd ave until it arrived at ps148.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;m not sure how it works now, but as a curtesy the bus driver should pull over as far as possible and not turn on the lights and stop sign until he see&#039;s the child exiting his or her home. just my 2 cents.

					I&#039;ve had great memories of Jackson Theater.&nbsp; I remember back when I was in Junior High (IS145) some friends and I would go there all the time.&nbsp; It cost $3.00 at the time and we were able to see all the showings.&nbsp; Im not sure how it is now being that its been an extremely long time that I visited Jackson Theater.&nbsp; However, the exterior still looks the same and they seem to be busy.<br /><br />Like most mom and pop establishments corporate America has taken over.&nbsp; Everything form book, hardware, candy stores have been effected by major chain retailers (Barnes &amp; Noble, Home Depot, Multi/Mega Plex Theathers). I am happy that Jackson Theater still have it&#039;s loyal movie goers.&nbsp; I do admit (from my last J. Theather experience) that the film quality may not be up to par but it has tradition.
