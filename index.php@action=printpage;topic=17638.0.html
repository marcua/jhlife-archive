				Like the old saying goes, &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;&nbsp; Today, I ordered the $10.00 Eggplant Parmigiana lunch special (no pasta) with salad for $10.00.&nbsp; This was a very small portion of eggplant and a equally small portion of salad not worth anywhere near $10.00.&nbsp; If I had gone next door to Tomo&#039;s Japanese Restaurant, for $8.25, I could have had a Salmon Bento Box, a large and hearty meal.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Am wondering if you could post pictures the next time? One persons idea of a small portion may be another persons<br />perfectly sized meal. Sounds also like you might have been torn between the two places and Sacs won. I find the <br />portions at Tomo to be suspiciously large making me think quality might not be as good as possible.

While I&#039;ve never had the eggplant parmigiana, I have had some of the other entrées at both lunch and dinner and found the portions to be perfectly acceptable. Also, the quality is quite high for a pizzeria especially when Dom is there, so I&#039;m willing to pay a bit of a premium (if there is one) for that.<br /><br />To compare Sac&#039;s with Tomo is unfair. They are obviously totally different from each other so I consider the comparison to be invalid. It would be better to judge Sac&#039;s against any of the other pizza joints in the neighborhood rather than a Japanese place. Of course, if portion size is the only criterion for judging quality, that changes the argument substantially, and this neighborhood has no shortage of low quality (not to mention hygienically questionable) restaurants where you can get a large portion of food for very little money. Hell, it&#039;s even filled with low quality, higher priced restaurants that many people have convinced themselves are excellent, but that is a subject for another thread.

				I completely agree with Clyde that I never should have compared SAC&#039;s to Tomo.&nbsp; So I&#039;ll compare them to Louie&#039;s which I regret not going to.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had both the eggplant and chicken parmigiana at Louie&#039;s for $12.00 regardless of the time of day and the portion&#039;s are large.&nbsp; The regular dinner portion for both entrees at SAC&#039;s is $16.99 compared to $12.00 at Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; At Louie&#039;s you have a choice of salad or pasta for $12.00.&nbsp; The $10.00 lunch at SAC&#039;s is only salad no pasta.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had either chicken or eggplant parmigiana in my life without pasta.&nbsp; Louie&#039;s is well aware that he could never survive with SAC prices of $16.95 for an entree.&nbsp; I know that SAC&#039;s has followers but not very many.&nbsp; I was at SAC&#039;s at 1:30 on Friday and there was just one customer who ordered one slice of regular pizza.&nbsp; &nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for SAC&#039;s pizza or dinner entrees but I strongly advise against the skimpy over priced $10.00 lunch.&nbsp; Next time, I&#039;ll walk the few extra blocks to Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; I just assumed that I couldn&#039;t go wrong going with SAC&#039;s (my first visit) and I was wrong.&nbsp; While there are residents in Jackson Heights who will pay extra for SAC&#039;s most can&#039;t.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t had the lunch special at Sacs so I can&#039;t comment. Nor am I a &quot;follower&quot;.&nbsp; I do get pizza there though and I CAN tell you that the ingredients Sacs uses is of a much higher quality...no comparison to Louie&#039;s (IMO), but to each his own.&nbsp; There are enough options to pick and choose.

				I&#039;m not making a judgement on whether Sac&#039;s is a good value, but it IS pretty expensive.&nbsp; It&#039;s closer to the price I&#039;d expect to pay if I was going to a nice place to sit down and eat.&nbsp; Clearly, they&#039;re not.&nbsp; They certainly don&#039;t have the overhead of supporting a large menu and servers.&nbsp; The few times I&#039;ve passed by and thought to grab a slice, the scant few pieces of pizza they had looked like they&#039;d been sitting forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />That all said, if their $10.00 lunch special is selling to their satisfaction, they need not do anything.&nbsp; If not, I&#039;m sure there will be revisions.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m glad Sac&#039;s is in the neighborhood.&nbsp; To date, I&#039;ve been satisfied with their pizza, and only wish the location was more like what they have in Astoria in terms of restaurant size.&nbsp; It would be great if we had more options for full-fledged, sit-down Italian.&nbsp; This brings Romeo&#039;s (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=16815.msg80390#msg80390) to mind.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping it opens soon!

				I&#039;m also looking forward to Romeo&#039;s opening soon especially since it&#039;s just two blocks from my apartment.&nbsp; It&#039;s now 8 months since they announced there opening and hopefully it be much longer and that it will be far better than Sac&#039;s and in a much better Jackson Height Location including Louie&#039;s.&nbsp;

				I have the Sac&#039;s lunch special regularly and always enjoy it. The portions are fine for me. I find that big portions of pasta make me feel lethargic and over-stuffed. Yes, Sac&#039;s is a little pricey, but I assume that&#039;s because everything is made in-house. I am willing to pay a little extra for that.

				While I think it&#039;s totally fine to post a grievance about a restaurant&#039;s food (it sounds like the original poster didn&#039;t particularly enjoy the meal, i get that), this thread also illustrates the very problem that we&#039;re discussing in relation to the posted Eater article describing the double–bind for queens restaurants over pricing vs rent.&nbsp; This is a neighborhood (and it&#039;s true of the borough) that&#039;s widely associated with &quot;cheap eats,&quot; which means patrons are often unwilling to pay a premium for high quality food, as there&#039;s always the expectation of a deal.

				I love both Louies and Sacs and I think both are of excellent quality and far above other pizza places in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I agree there is an enormous issue with the high rents and viability of businesses in this neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;d also add that large portions are a US problem that has resulted in serious health issues, so I&#039;m usually glad when a restaurant takes care of my usual gluttonous ways.

				Big portions mean leftovers, or you can order one entree that will serve two people. But I wouldn&#039;t necessarily think to complain about a restaurant serving a portion that is not oversized--I agree it helps rein in the impulse to eat too much.<br />

				Tried Sac&#039;s on Seamless for the first time tonight--we&#039;re not big on pizza, so we ordered chicken dishes--chicken parm and chicken with lemon and mushrooms, with linguini and salad on the side. A bit pricey--but quite good!
