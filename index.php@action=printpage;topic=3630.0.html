				Has anyone heard about police being ordered to crack down on subway performers?&nbsp; I may be in the minority, but I happen to enjoy the varied performers and have even purchased some nice CDs in the past.&nbsp; The Gothamist story below makes mention that there&#039;s only anecdotal evidence to suggest that the performers are indeed being harassed, so I&#039;m hoping that the story is overblown.<br /><br />From <strong>Gothamist.com</strong>:<br /><br />Are Cops Cracking Down on Subway Performers?

				How about a crackdown on late trains, missing signage, poor announcements and dirty stations?&nbsp; &nbsp; :tickedoff:

				I did actually see an officer relocate a woman with a guitar in the Roosevelt Avenue station last week, but it didn&#039;t look like she got a ticket, just instructions.<br /><br />On a semi related note, those guys that collect money and give food to anyone who is hungry?&nbsp; I did see one of them get a ticket on the train last month.&nbsp; Not for panhandling, but for walking between cars.&nbsp; As he loudly announced to everyone on our car (he had walked from our car, and was walked back into it by a cop), it&#039;s now a $75 ticket for walking in between cars.<br /><br />Something to think about next time you&#039;re in a smelly or full car and want to walk through to the next one ... better to hop up at the next station via the platform.

				the fines have actually been at that level for a little more than four years, for what it&#039;s worth. the mta site has a pretty exhaustive list of &quot;don&#039;ts&quot; on the site...including drinking coffee/tea/etc, which is also illegal. and yes, i know someone who got a summons for a cup o&#039; joe around monthly quota time.<br /><br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E6DB1531F933A05755C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2

				That drinking thing is truly crazy.<br /><br />I do know the bag on the seat next to rule is only if the bag is an obstruction ... like if the car is empty, its ok.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find the rule but when it was in the news I looked it up.<br /><br />I havea lso seen cops wake people up sleeping on the train.&nbsp; I don&#039;t mean the homeless fellow spread out, but suit and tie commuters sleeping while sitting.&nbsp; That may be a rule too.

				And the subway crackdowns continue.&nbsp; &nbsp;This time it involves ticking people in the wee hours of the night for taking up more than one seat.<br /><br />From <strong>The New York Post:</strong><br /><br />Nighttime riders in big sit fit (http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/space_hogs_lapped_on_empty_subways_m7iRAd9b4E9alYPuGvy5OO)

				That&#039;s so weird, because if you don&#039;t have your feet up on the seat, that shouldn&#039;t be an issue in an empty (or even partially empty) train.<br /><br />(1) occupy more than one seat on a station, platform or conveyance <strong>when to do so would interfere or tend to interfere with the operation of the Authorityâ€™s transit system or the comfort of other passengers</strong>; (2) place his or her foot on a seat on a station, platform or conveyance; (3) lie on the floor, platform, stairway, landing or conveyance; or (4) block free movement on a station, stairway, platform or conveyance;<br /><br /><br />http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm

				It would interesting (but possibly dangerous) to print that and carry it, in case such is said.<br /><br />Morning commute, I travel against the rush (I go to Jamaica, switch for a bus), so my train usually has seats galore, and I have put my schoolbag on the seat next to me.&nbsp; Makes me wonder now ...

				According to Gothamist, subway ticketing did indeed increase by 17% during the period of January through November, 2009 and in comparison to the previous year.&nbsp; $50 is the fine for hogging a seat.&nbsp; The problem is that people are still complaining that tickets are being handed out during off peak hours when the subways are practically empty.<br /><br />From <strong>Gothamist:</strong><br /><br />NYPD Crackdown on Subway Riders Using More Than 1 Seat (http://gothamist.com/2010/01/26/nypd_crackdown_on_subway_riders_usi.php)

				I musts ay I have been more mindful of puuting my bag on the seat lately.<br /><br />But I swear and still can&#039;t find the exact wording online ... I think the actual law says or said at one point if the bag causes &quot;discomfort&quot; or some such, almost to imply if the train was empty, you were good.<br /><br />Granted, we all know ticket quotas are ticket quotas ...<br /><br />

				Many years ago, they use to have a sign in writing that is:<br /><br />No eating<br />No music playing<br />No spitting<br /><br />Young enough to ride for free<br />Young enough to ride your knee<br /><br />Also you were not allowed to cross your legs on the trains and buses, and yes there is a rule that if you put your bag or other items on the seat next&nbsp; to you, you will be fined.<br /><br />Now all these rules are broken all the time, and I don&#039;t see the cops doing really much of anything.<br />They need to post these signs in English, Spanish,Chinese, Russian, Indian, Arabic. :coolsmiley:<br /><br />But even then people will break the rules because the feel they are entitled.<br />
