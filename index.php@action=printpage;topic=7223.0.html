				The Daily News has an excellent article about a coop complex in Bayside that has price floors on sales.&nbsp; Essentially the coop won&#039;t allow units to be sold below certain prices.&nbsp; The coop thinks this helps the coops keep value.&nbsp; My co-worker lives in this complex and the rule is preventing the sale of his coop.&nbsp; His wife recently had twins and he needs a bigger space but realtors have told him that his unit will never sell for anything near the price floor so he is stuck there. I would sue the coop board if this was my apartment. The article mentions a liberal subletting policy but that policy charges the shareholder $2,400 a year to sublet.<br /><br />I would never buy in a coop like this or one with a flip tax.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any buildings in JH that have a price floor?<br /><br />http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/stories/price-floors-leave-many-new-yorkers-stuck-apartments

				i like the idea of a price floor. a lot.<br /><br />let&#039;s say you own an apartment that&#039;s your primary residence, and the fair value is 250K<br /><br />then you have someone unload a place to a relative for 75K, as a wedding gift<br /><br />and then a sponsor decides to bail and divest itself of a couple units at fire sale prices, say, 125K<br /><br />comps come up and the value of your place is depressed .... a 250K apartment is now worth 150K. <br /><br />my place is my home, not an &quot;investment&quot; but still, i don&#039;t want people intentionally depressing its value.

				Coop boards have a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. Therefore, a price floor does not seem unreasonable, as long as it&#039;s based on a fair assessment of the market value for the unit. What&#039;s a fair valuation in the current real estate market however is the real question, especially when qualifying for a mortgage has become so much more difficult for many people out there. It does not pay for a coop to have units vacant, in default, or in foreclosure either, so the board must weigh one factor against the other.<br /><br />Likewise, a flip tax can be a very useful tool in helping a coop board to meet its expenses with regard to building upkeep and capital improvements. It rewards those who put down roots and discourages people who buy a property mostly as a form of short-term investment, which admittedly was more commonplace prior to the Great Recession than today.<br /><br />There are other &quot;games&quot; coop boards play. For example, I&#039;m aware that several historic buildings in JH report artificially low monthly maintenance charges, and make up for the deficits in their operating budgets through an annual &quot;surcharge&quot; or assessment. Whether this helps on the resale value of their units or not, I do not know.

				i wasn&#039;t aware of the surcharge/lower maintenance trade-off trick.....and i always wondered why some of the nicer buildings had such jarringly low monthly fees. i guess i feel a little better now.&nbsp; :)

				<strong>Yes...the Coop does have a duty to maintain certain standards like minimum price per share but most Sponsors wont just drop or dump their units one at a time. &nbsp;Typically the sponsors will figure out a way to sale the entire package. &nbsp;I have been involved in half a dozen (or so) estate sales with Coops. &nbsp;Most people are afraid to reach out to a Board. &nbsp;An approach is very simple...CASH BUYER &nbsp;(Now, now - Please don&#039;t say there are no cash buyers out there...66% to 70% of my sales are to cash buyer)<br /><br />First, you educate the executor and possibly their attorney (yes, most lawyers are NOT COOP savvy). &nbsp;You agree on a &quot;fire sale&quot; price but it must be for a cash buyer (BANKS WILL ONLY ALLOW ABOUT 6% concession, SO THE FOLLOWING APPROACH WONT WORK) . &nbsp;Example...if the average price for a similar unit is $200k, you may want to agree to dump the unit for $150k Cash (if the market is bad). &nbsp;Then you have the executor and the attorney reach out to the management and the Coops lawyer. &nbsp;They explain the perilous situation the family is going through and humbly ask that they be as flexible with a buyer as possible.&nbsp; They introduce the listing Broker and the he / she promises to get a minimum price for the unit and you put it out to market FOR CASH BUYERS ONLY. &nbsp;Keep the Unit off the MLS and use every other source...including your local brokers to market the unit. &nbsp;Once you get a Cash buyer, you explain to them that the contract price will be much higher but they will be given a buyers concession that would bring the purchase price at closing to the agreed upon price. &nbsp;The sale is registered at the price the Board is happy with, the transfer taxes and if applicable, the flip tax would be representative of the &quot;registered&quot; sale price.<br /><br />Some may think this is unethical, but as long as it is done due to a traumatic event like a death in the family or extreme financial hardship, then. <em><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">by all means necessary</span>! &nbsp;</strong> </em> Anyway, I don&#039;t know anyone letting $50k &nbsp;or $100k on the table when everything indicates an easy and quick sale. &nbsp;The most important factor is to make sure you and your attorney network with the management and their attorney. &nbsp;It is better to let the most influential people advocate for you and your cause. &nbsp;Once a Board says NO, it is difficult to have them change their mind.</strong>
