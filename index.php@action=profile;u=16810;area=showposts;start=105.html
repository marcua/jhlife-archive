					I just got a promo card for Retro Fitness on Northern Boulevard &amp; Broadway (near the Best Buy). It says Astoria, but it&#039;s a pretty short drive/bus ride from JH. Has anybody been to it yet? For $20/month, it sounds like a great deal. I joined CrossFit in Astoria but since I don&#039;t have a car and the hours don&#039;t really work for me, I am back on the search.

					Is it just me, or are there alot of co-ops for sale in the area lately? I know there&#039;s usually an increase in listed properties in most areas during the summer, as sellers try to capitalize on increased foot traffic.However, after perusing listings on Craigslist, Streeteasy and various broker sites, there seems to be quite a bit of inventory. Is it just the summer rush? Or are people fleeing the area?

					I apologize if this is a duplicate post. I recently got my finger smashed between two doors at the Roosevelt-74th street train station. The doors are on the side facing Roosevelt--- across the street from Dunkin Donuts. Upon further investigation, I noticed that there&#039;s a high probability for injury with those doors. The handicap-access door and the door immediately to the right of it open onto each other and have heavy metal handles. If you are trying to be nice, holding the door for someone else could be very dangerous there. I&#039;m not sure why those doors don&#039;t open away from each other instead of onto each other, but they should. <br /><br />I reported it to the MTA station manager, but I doubt anything will be done until someone sustains a more serious injury.&nbsp; Has anybody else had any experiences with those doors?

					It seems like the posts on Donner Gardens are based on information from 2,5 and/or 8 years ago. I moved there in 2009 and still live there, so I&#039;ll throw in my 2 cents.&nbsp; I can&#039;t speak for all the buildings though. This review is for the building at 81st &amp; 34th.<br /><br />There is a no-dog rule and an 80% carpet rule but neither one seems to be enforced. The no-dog thing is particularly annoying because there are so many people in the neighborhood generally who don&#039;t pick up after their dogs. Not saying that these are the same people who are violating Donner&#039;s no-dog rule, but it&#039;s always a possibility.&nbsp; Iâ€™m curious to know if other buildings have similar rules that are also unenforced because there are A LOT of dogs in the area. <br /><br />The no-carpet thing hasn&#039;t been a problem, as neighbors are generally respectful of their noise levels. For what itâ€™s worth, my hallway is mostly older people/couples who have been in the building for a long time. I have never actually seen anyone that appears to be under the age of about 20, although I have heard a couple kids on the weekends.<br /><br />I noticed some pen scrawling on walls in the lobby. It was definitely unattractive, and it was up for a few months before it was painted over.<br />I haven&#039;t had many interactions with the super himself, but I see the staff everyday. They clean the grounds and the refuse room on a daily basis and I think they do a pretty good job. Especially considering that there is someone who puts loose garbage in the chute on my floor probably once/week. I&#039;m not sure why the person thinks that&#039;s a good idea, but nevertheless, the chute and the room get cleaned daily. I went on vacation for a couple weeks and came back to find that a package had been delivered in my absence.&nbsp; The super (or one of his staff) saw it sitting outside my door for a couple days and put it in the office for me, which I thought was nice.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have never seen any urination in the elevator. That is totally gross and if that started happening, I&#039;d definitely want to leave because it&#039;s just trashy.<br /><br />I have heard that some residents had bedbugs. Fortunately it didn&#039;t happen to me or any of the people on my floor or the surrounding floors. I have to say that although bedbugs are scary and annoying, you can&#039;t really blame that on a building or even the people who live in the building, as it&#039;s now so pervasive in NYC. There were bedbugs at the Ritz, Niketown and the AMC movie theater in Manhattan among other â€œesteemedâ€ places. (Side note: you could get them from your moving company&#039;s trucks, so be careful!) I think the thing to do is check the management&#039;s response to bedbugs. I&#039;ve heard that some places try to pretend that there are no bedbugs or they make you pay for extermination by yourself. Again, fortunately, I have no experience with that issue in this building, so I don&#039;t know how they respond.<br /><br />The only roaches Iâ€™ve seen have been dead ones. Iâ€™d rather not see any at all, but Iâ€™ll take dead ones over live ones any day. That said, Iâ€™m fanatical about cleanliness and donâ€™t leave garbage in my apartment overnight, donâ€™t leave dishes in the sink, etc. I have never required the services of the exterminator but there is a sign-up for one if necessary.<br /><br />Some people think itâ€™s too far from the train, but it depends on what you like. I looked at apartments right off 37th or Roosevelt and although they were more convenient to the train, I donâ€™t like being near heavy foot traffic like that and I felt like there was too much litter from all the shops. Ideally I would have moved somewhere on 35th, but those apartments were more expensive. <br /><br />All in all, Iâ€™d give it a solid B.&nbsp; Areas for improvement: 1) definitely too hot in the winter and there arenâ€™t any individual unit controls, so unless you install them yourself, you will be in shorts and a t-shirt with windows wide open in the middle of winter.&nbsp; They are probably wasting a ton in heating because of this. 2) Iâ€™m not sure how they could fix this, but parking on this street is almost impossible, and access to the garage is non-existent for new residents. Someone needs to die or move for you to get it. 3)They could make the common areas a little nicer. 4) They should start handing out fines for violating the no-dog policy (and others) or stop saying that those policies even exist. 5) Educate residents about proper garbage disposal.<br /><br />Curious to hear from the 2010 commenter about the murdered super. I had never heard of that (although I could definitely see why people would want to keep that quiet). Was he actually murdered in the building? Was it by a resident? Or did he just happen to be a super for the building who was murdered somewhere, by someone, completely unrelated to anything to do with the building? <br />
