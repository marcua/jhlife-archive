				I have a garden space behind my home on 75th St. that is about 20 feet x 20 feet. It is fenced, locked and gets full sun all day! There is even a compost bin here. I am looking for a responsible, considerate and experienced gardener who would like more room to grow vegetables, perennials or whatever (that&#039;s legal!) in our city and would be willing to adopt the space. All I ask is that you communicate with me in advance about your plans for planting and maintain the space weekly throughout the year, keeping it trimmed and trash free. <br /><br />If you are interested please email me at suecummings@yahoo.com and tell me more about yourself: where do you live? what type of work do you do? what is your gardening experience? what would you like to do with the space?

				<strong>Fuzzy...I don&#039;t want to be offensive, but I am confused about this posting.&nbsp; I can see someone growing vegetables and obviously sharing them with the &quot;landlord&quot; during the<em><span class="bbc_u"> season</span></em>.&nbsp; Beside someone that would grow vegetables during the spring / summer and ripping the benefits of an &quot;organic&quot; diet during a season or even satisfying a hobby...why would someone grab a 400sq ft lot and maintain it for you during the entire year in NY?&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m short sighted but all I can see it&#039;s the &quot;landlord&quot; benefiting from someones else&#039;s <del>free labor&nbsp; </del>&nbsp; efforts.</strong>&nbsp; :-\

				both sides make some sense to me, native:<br /><br />some people really welcome the chance to garden (our garden commitee is very popular) and the chance to grow veggies is a bonus. not sure if the OP was asking to share in the harvest -- that would seem right, but it&#039;s not mentioned here.

				I would like to clarify several misconceptions here. First, I can tell that NYC Native is not a gardener, because gardening is not only a spring/summer activity. For gardeners there are things to do every month of the year. In the early fall cold weather crops can be planted for harvesting after frost. The dead of winter is the busiest time for planning. This may seem to be a small point but it does prove that NYC Native&#039;s lack of experience has led to him to miss the value of what I&#039;m offering here. Perhaps he should spend some time outside the five boroughs, where gardening is more common, in order to understand?<br /><br />Secondly, I am offended that he is implying my offer is trying to take advantage of someone. If I were, as he&nbsp; suggests, a greedy landlord, I could simply do what the 9 other homeowners have done in the row of 10 historic houses on my street, and pave over their backyard for parking spaces. I would immediately net about $300 a month in rental cashflow. I have stubbornly held out and resisted this idea because I believe in the value of green space. And this leads to my third point...which is...<br /><br />I am not the only one who benefits by keeping my backyard green. I would suggest that NYC Native, and all my neighbors, also benefit through improvement of the quality of air they breathe and water they drink, as well as preserving the beauty of the neighborhood and a Jackson Heights tradition. After all, it was the original architects of of our community who envisioned it as &quot;a garden in the city.&quot;<br /><br />Fourth, I am not suggesting that any potential gardener share their &quot;crops&quot; with me in some exploitive sharecropping arrangement. I don&#039;t even care whether they grow food or flowers. I am out of town too much to garden the space myself, and as I am sad to see a valuable resource going to waste, I would like to share it with a neighbor or two.<br /><br />I have already had one serious inquiry about the space but he may be willing to share part of it with someone else, so please reply if you are interested in my original posting.<br />

				When we lived in an apt I dreamt of having a garden and would have loved this.. Now I have one and it is alot of work but so rewarding. I think your offering is&nbsp; wonderful opportunity for&nbsp; someone who might not have the resources. I hope someone takes you up on your offer.

				Hey, i thought it was a great offer as well. You also get a big&nbsp; &nbsp;:-*&nbsp; for not paving over the garden area, like so many of your neighbors! And yes, if you are a Gardner, many things can be done during the winter months. Their are beautiful sunny winter days when i enjoy stepping out into the garden, to prune, shovel, build a snowman or just plan for the spring. I hope someone takes you up on the offer, and may your garden bloom!

				I&#039;m surprised that someone even <em>attempted </em> to turn the OP&#039;s generous offer into a negative. &gt;:(
