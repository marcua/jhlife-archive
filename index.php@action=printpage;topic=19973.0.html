				Did anyone take part in or witness Saturday&#039;s peaceful protest which began at Diversity Plaza? It looks like there was a great turnout based on the photos here: https://qns.com/story/2020/05/30/developing-protesters-take-to-the-streets-of-jackson-heights-woodside/ (https://qns.com/story/2020/05/30/developing-protesters-take-to-the-streets-of-jackson-heights-woodside/)<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t aware this was taking place, but I came across a heavy police presence following the protest when I went to Angel to pick up dinner. <br /><br />There were other protests throughout Queens over the weekend:<br />https://patch.com/new-york/queens/queens-protesters-demand-justice-george-floyd (https://patch.com/new-york/queens/queens-protesters-demand-justice-george-floyd)<br />The video included shows the police kneeling in unity with the protesters which is really moving.<br /><br />Does anyone know if more are scheduled in our area or elsewhere in Queens soon? <br /><br />

				Hi Matt,<br /><br />You can usually find info about Queens protests on the FB group Hearts Across Queens - https://www.facebook.com/groups/1152295071506879/<br /><br />On IG, follow @justiceforgeorgenyc for info on protests throughout the city. <br /><br />Kim

				Thanks, Kim and NYer1008. I don&#039;t have Facebook or Instagram accounts, but I can at least view the most recent posts on Instagram. Both have moved to a FOMO model to lure people into joining, but I feel the cost of an account is too high (I realize an account is &quot;free&quot;).

				&nbsp;Am not sure how the Travers Park event to mourn George Floyd&#039;s death was publicized, but heard it went well. Has anyone heard of an online event for those who can&#039;t attend in person events at this time?

				The question we need to ask ourselves is, if large gatherings are now allowed why can&#039;t our small business be opened?&nbsp; <br /><br />Politicians on both sides need to be asked this question.

Large permitted events such as the LGBTQ Pride Parade have been canceled. <br /><br />In addition to essential services currently in operation the following businesses are scheduled to open in the first phase of NYC&#039;s reopening: <br /><br />Construction<br />Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting<br />Retail - (Limited to curbside or in-store pickup or drop off)<br />Manufacturing<br />Wholesale Trade<br /><br />https://forward.ny.gov/phase-one-industries (https://forward.ny.gov/phase-one-industries)<br /><br />This likely will include some of our small businesses, but definitely not all. It looks like phase one is on schedule for 6/8 as dssjh mentioned.

				Many thanks for this great, informative thread! <br /><br />Where can we find information on (participating in) the silent vigil/meditation circle taking place on 34th Ave near the Greenmarket the past two weekends (or so)? Are there other days and/or locations?

				The Instagram account @justiceforgeorgenyc has daily updates on protests around the city. (It seems to be updated much more frequently than the @justiceforgeorgequeens account for some reason.)<br /><br />There’s one scheduled for 1pm today at 74th and Roosevelt.

				It&#039;s time to defund the police. Money needs to be spent on education, healthcare, mental health, and revitalizing our communities. We don&#039;t need militarized police departments anymore.
