I was born in &#039;62.

Bickford&#039;s!&nbsp; That was inside the terminal at 74th and Roosevelt.&nbsp; That was where my father took me for hamburgers.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was another pool hall on the corner of 82nd and Roosevelt, by the train station there.&nbsp; Across 82nd Street was Chock Full &#039;O Nuts, on the corner (not part of the original arrangement of the early 60s), then, around the corner, Meyers ice cream parlor, then the Continental deli (a good German deli on every block, in those days!) then Shelley&#039;s bakery (the best bakery in town) and the butcher shop, and then something else that I can&#039;t recall; maybe a jewelery store.&nbsp; <br /><br />Across Roosevelt was the bank, on the corner, then the notions shop, then, I think, the Army/Navy store - - and then maybe a toy store (or perhaps that was on the next block).&nbsp; <br /><br />Around the corner from the bank was the Colony Delicatessen, a florist&#039;s,maybe a pizza shop at one time, a little records/instrument shop, the Jackson movie theater, and a little fruit store and butcher shop on that corner.&nbsp; Around the corner was, eventually, a little book shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was that little triangle, with benches and a few old trees, where people would sit and feed the pigeons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coming down 82nd Street, toward Roosevelt, on the opposite side of the street, was a small apartment building that was put up in the mid-60s, on the corner of 82nd and Baxter, the candy store, belonging to the Sbarrs, a little Spanish record shop, a tiny grocery store, then the small vacuum cleaner store, then a couple of little old buildings with professional offices in them, then a beauty salon called Si Jolie, I might be missing something here, then the Associated food store, something else that I don&#039;t recall, Joey D&#039;s Pizzeria, a Hallmark store, a doughnut shop, a little luncheonette, a creepy little building that once had a fortune teller in it (there was a bus stop in front of the luncheonette), Disco Roosevelt Drugs, on the corner, a florist around the corner from it, a couple of other things that escape me at the moment, and on the next block, the Lido Italian resturant and the New Cathay Chinese resturant (Cantonese and Mandarin).&nbsp; There was, I recall, a picture framing shop on that block.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the corner of 80th and Roosevelt was the vet, Klausman&#039;s.&nbsp; A funeral home across the avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />On 81st and Roosevelt was that steak house that someone mentioned, that was a meeting place for sharply-dressed mafiosos in the builders association, where they would have lunch, and another great German deli; there used to be a candy store on that corner, way back, before they put in that steak house.&nbsp; Then another bank.&nbsp; <br /><br />A candy store on the corner, opposite Disco Drugs, and the pool hall over that candy store.&nbsp; They put in a Puppy Palace for a while, I remember, next to it, I think.&nbsp; Opposite, next to the Chock Full &#039;O Nuts was a jewelry store, a Merit Farms, Joyce Leslie and another women&#039;s store, either after or before a teeny little pizza place, downstairs from which was the bowling alley, then another store that sold cut flowers, I think - - all very narrow shops, there, and the Woolworth&#039;s, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />On Broadway, off 82nd Street, which became Baxter Avenue, was a big German resturant, with lots of little mounted antlers all over the place, called the Hoffbrau.&nbsp; A car wash across Broadway.&nbsp; The Elmwood Diner on the other side of the street, beside the playground across from the hospital.&nbsp; <br /><br />And every Christmas-time they&#039;d put up garlands and lights all down 82nd Street, and on 37th Avenue, and at night, to a little child, it looked lovely and special.&nbsp;

Also sold discount shampoo/cosmetics before the CVS&#039;s and Walgreen&#039;s of this world.<br /><br /><strong>Northern Lanes</strong> on 75th Street of Northern, (bowling lanes were bumpy) Now part of the car dealer.<br /><br />There were industries on the west side of the Heights near the Connecting Railroad. Place that did plating, a surgical instrument maker and a printer. White Castle District Office still remains.<br /><br />You could actually play with ALL your schoolmates in PS69&#039;s and IS 145&#039;s school yards<br /><br />Cafe 77 was a real Chinese Laundry, took many of my Grandfathers shirts there (and each regular customer had a mark)<br /><br />The <strong>Jackson Heights Library</strong> actually had BOOKS in it. Rows and rows of books. Didn&#039;t have to wait for inter-branch loans to come in.<br /><br />Brown&#039;s Army and Navy Stores still survive!<br /><br />Grandmother used to make the trek to <strong>Pick-n-Pack</strong> down on 37th and 85th(?) for discount meat and then complain about all the red food dye they used. <br /><br />The Big Delicatessen on Roosevelt between 82nd and 83rd, (German Potato Salad).<br /><br />The movie theater on Northern had big holes in the roof but would let you in to see the &quot;R&quot; rated movies.<br /><br /><strong>The Roman Cave </strong>was the place to go for Italian Food and treated little kids like kings!<br /><br /><strong>The Old Barn</strong> on Roosevelt and 80th(/) served family sized meals. You could buy your furniture at <strong>Jackson Furniture</strong> across the street.<br /><br />The <strong>Garden School</strong> had guard dogs in their yard. They were the type that would let you in, but then you could not leave. (Great &quot;kid&quot; fun petting the guard dog then having your buddy distract the dog so you could get your hand out of the fence holes) The car dealers had dogs too.<br /><br />You can now add the Q19B to the list of things &quot;gone&quot; at least in name.<br /><br />There was no 115 Pct. You had to deal with the 114 Pct. or 110 Pct. and wait FOREVER for a patrol car. Heaven help the person who had an auto accident on Northern. They might still be waiting&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /> <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Went to Garden School for primary grades, before they had guard dogs (but yes; I remember, years later, them installing them).&nbsp; At that time, the entire block was green and suburban-looking - - they didn&#039;t call it &quot;Garden&quot; for no reason!&nbsp; There was a springtime carnival on the front lawn, before there was any fencing, there (or the dogs, that came even later).&nbsp; I remember the school cafeteria had murals on all the walls, scenes from Alice In Wonderland.&nbsp; Jackson Heights was very lovely then.</em></div>

I lived there for a *year*, and for a year, I greeted my neighbors, every day, with a smile, and an appropriate greeting.&nbsp; When I left, after a *year*, I was still smiling and saying &quot;hello&quot;,and still *no one was returning the greeting*!&nbsp; Those people looked through me as if I weren&#039;t even there.&nbsp; They behaved as if I were an unwelcome intruder in *their* neighborhood.&nbsp; It was *not* &quot;coming home&quot;, as I had expected it to be.<br />As we are expressing personal opinions, and memories and impressions of the neighborhood in which we all grew up, I take the liberty of saying that it is disheartening for me to hear the only place I ever considered &quot;home&quot; being described as the &quot;top south Asian shopping district in the U.S.&quot;!&nbsp; And that, as such, your comment only magnifies the impression I get that Jackson Heights only remains in name - - and that the entire purpose and flavor of that neighborhood has been entirely destroyed.&nbsp; No longer is it a world away from the city; a safe, peaceful haven, away from the madding crowd.<br />Might I also point out to you that there is no such thing as &quot;*fine* Indian Jewelry&quot;, and that rows and rows of saree shops don&#039;t exactly transform J.H. into Beverly Hills.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t please me that Indian brides from all over the U.S. crowd into Jackson Heights and clog the neighborhood with that kind of traffic.&nbsp; What you are describing is *commercial*, and does not belong in a neighborhood, where people raise their families.&nbsp; The congestion of Manhattan is not what former residents of that neighborhood were aiming for.&nbsp; I have looked at the traffic reports for J.H., and seen that there was, a few years ago, an attempt to change a certain traffic routing, that was deemed to be *too much* for that neighborhood to accomodate.&nbsp; That was a very good indication of how much things have changed there.&nbsp; <br />The country has changed, and neighborhoods have changed with it - - for the worse!&nbsp; Oh, wouldn&#039;t you have loved to have been able to leave your back door unlocked, as we did, so that your children could run in and out, as they played, unguarded and without threat, in that neighborhood?&nbsp; Once - - it was heaven.&nbsp; I cannot help but mourn the loss of that.&nbsp; <br />One error that you make is in your combinations of immigrants, that you cite.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t as you say, you see.&nbsp; The Irish, Germans, Greeks, Italians, and Jews, who lived in J.H., all lived there at the same time.&nbsp; This was *European* culture - - and it was *compatible*.&nbsp; There *were* NO Puerto Ricans in Jackson Heights - - this was part of Manhattan&#039;s culture; not ours.&nbsp; &#039;West Side Story&#039; wasn&#039;t happening in our neighborhood - - unless it was playing at the Jackson.&nbsp; And Hispanic immigrants who came were from Cuba, Spain, and Columbia, and were entirely embracing of European culture; they were not distaff to the existing culture.&nbsp; And the neighborhood did not change to accomodate them.&nbsp; As you can see, from the descriptions of the stores and shops of yesteryear, Jackson Heights had its own culture, and when you came to live there, you became part of that neighborhood - - it didn&#039;t change to accomodate you.<br />I now live in a neighborhood where you have to have a car, and drive for miles, on shopping *expeditions*, to be able to access food and products you might want - - unless you are black, Hispanic or south Asian.&nbsp; Is that a *comfortable* neighborhood for me to live in?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; (And *where* is the comfortable, convenient neighborhood for me to live in, that I can afford???)&nbsp; Again I will repeat, that were I to visit India, and discover that an entire neighborhood had been taken over by former residents of Jackson Heights, and made to entirely resemble that neighborhood, I would say - - &quot;What a shame!&quot;.<br />P.S.&nbsp; Nothing &quot;stale&quot; about a place that is reliably the sort of neighborhood that I knew J.H. to be!</em></div>

I&#039;ve forgotten lots of these places.---bred in Jackson Heights ---over 30 years total.<br />Let&#039;s see some that may have been missed.<br /><br /><strong>Green Theme Florist</strong> on the corner of 75th and 37th ..northside...very dubious place...all sorts of plants and &quot;herbage&quot; could be purchased there. I was too young..just rumours <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><strong>Raja&#039;s </strong>candystore which was located where the city cafe is now..across the street from PS69. Old guy who was really grumpy and wore an old white smock would sell all the&nbsp; baseball card, fake bubblegum cigarettes, handballs, bazooka gum and milkshakes you ever wanted ...(may be that the furniture in City is part of the original Rajas...looks familiar).<br /><br /><strong>Ferns!! </strong>on 74th street!! good call on that one...BUT do you remember that beautiful black wooden saddled..and when I say saddle I mean I think it was a real saddle-- coin operated horse?<br /><br />Don&#039;s on the corner of 80th street and 37th avenue ...where the bodega is now.&nbsp; Candystore soda shop with video games at the rear!<br /><br /><strong>The Pit!</strong> the arcade in the lower levels of the 74th street station. Great stamp collectors shop across the hall and that sketchy bar right by the bus terminal on the 74th and Roosevelt.---had to pass the bar to get to the stairs leading to the arcade.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights Discount Bookstore</strong><br />Tons of old comic books, and I remember when they first opened they had 1000&#039;s of promotional movie photo BW stills..25 cents each.<br /><br /><strong>Barrs </strong>across the street from the Post office...a toystore and gift shop. Had great boardgames in the back!<br /><br /><strong>Numbers Records and Tapes</strong> (and 8 tracks...dad bought Saturday Night Fever there)...used to be on the corner where Ingrids is now on 78th street.<br /><br />Of course the Colony...snuck into my first rated R movie there.&nbsp; Conan the Barbarian....starring Gov,. Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />There used to be a store joined to ShopWise on the 76th street side. I think it was a toy store of sorts but my memories about that place date me to about 3 years old so a little foggy.<br /><br />There was&nbsp; a great Chinese restaurant where that Atlantis 2000 club is now. It was Chino Latino..as they all spoke Spanish and my 1st Communion party was hosted in the rear social room!<br /><br />Speaking of social clubs...right there on 37th road and 77th street..a real sketchy social club that was eventually closed by the police..big raid and all.<br /><br />Concha D&#039;Oro was the name of the pizza place next to the&nbsp; Eagle ..and I swear they had the Best slice I have had to this day. I really miss that pizza. Was not very busy.<br /><br />Guilllietas Pizza was the name of the present Thomas&#039; on 77th. Slice for 5o cents sicilian 55.<br /><br />If I remember anything else....<br /><br /><br />HEY if anyone has any photographs of these shopfronts please let me know. I just posted something about Toy City which is cited somewhere here im sure. I&#039;m working on a little Jackson Heights memories project.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>Oh my God; it&#039;s all coming back to me!&nbsp; That was no rumor about the Green Theme; they *did* sell interesting things, in there!&nbsp; And I only originally remembered buying plants in there!&nbsp; You have jogged my memory!!</em></div>
