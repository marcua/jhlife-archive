					&nbsp;Want to let people know that lunch at Uncle Peters on Northern Blvd is usually pretty great but it&#039;s a special kind of restaurant for a splurge lunch here in JH. It&#039;s the food and the atmosphere and the professional staff that elevate the whole experience. An added feature of the outdoor dining shed is that the normal street traffic from Northern Blvd. is diminished and it&#039;s nice and quiet inside. Don&#039;t work for them but have been a couple of times lately and was pleasantly surprised at how nice the experience was. Any other favorites out there for a special place for lunch?

					&nbsp;Please support this little engine that could. JH has a lot of artists and once they are fully stocked this will be a valuable asset. Bought some terrific colored gel papers that we made a quasi stained glass project out of. They have a great assortment of card stock for original stationary and some high quality brushes that I have my eye on. Local shopping is a plus for the neighborhood and these owners are so <br />nice!

					&nbsp;Here&#039;s the type of graph info I&#039;m referring to about how busy 34th ave is at different times of the day<br />from Google business*. They are pretty much used everywhere now but maybe some haven&#039;t seen them yet. Can be obtained from Google business, that is unless you believe that 34th Ave is always consistently busy all 13hours and all 7 days of the week and there is no need for an analytics.<br />Just ran into a friend whose daughter is circling around 34th Ave looking for a place to pick her up for doc appt. She&#039;s so frustrated and says who can you talk to?? No one, there is no one...she says.<br /><br />&nbsp;Have you seen the MTA Data? Useless and ineptly collected is all I have to say. We need outside professionals who have done this before and who will take time to really understand the neighborhood and avoid random closures and placements as the MTA has done. Real facts please!<br /><br />&nbsp;*Popular times graph from Google Business: This graph shows how busy your location typically is during different times of the day. ...

					<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someday, it will become clear on this subject of rightsizing 34th ave OS, that there are people with legit different views. One side claims dominance now and says it has all sorts of support. Is this accurate? Has data collection been done to any extent and where has it been publicized? We need details on usage, like every chain restaurant and supermarket posts, for busy/slow hours. Then we can have a town hall style meeting with most affected parties at the table first. Rewind from the pandemic urgency to a more sophisticated plan.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And then we might see something different happen with the physical situation. So far, just metal barriers, no diverters, no cones or anything that had been discussed at meetings. Heavy metal barriers, period. Tiny confusing signs also and many people still really do not know who runs the whole thing. Volunteers or the city? Both? Spell it out clearly.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Outdoor dining is getting a case by case review which sounds great because some of the outdoor spaces are terrific and some are awful. Lots of other issues attached to outdoor dining. And we have lots of issues with OS and propose the same type of review for 34th Ave. Run the numbers, take the polls and knock on doors (no one we know has had anyone ask, ever in an official capacity about the impact of the closure). Look at footage from all hours of operations. Let&#039;s bring in professionals who know the whole city and can give an unbiased view of 34th Ave. See if it is the right JH street, first and then if it needs substantial alteration in length and timing. <br /><br />&nbsp; Needs a substantial review stat. Patient in distress.

					&nbsp;Sorry Captain, but it doesn&#039;t clear up a thing. Have been to many DOT meetings where they sit on their hands and at times, have implied they need to be fluid in response to the political headwinds on OS. Other OS look to be a seat of pants operation and it has been well documented in places where the neighborhoods push back and just move the barriers - or in at least one case- throw them in the Gowanus canal, their is community support. So no, there might be some official connections but DOT listen to higher powers and have been spineless with protection here. <br />&nbsp;What other OS can you point to that are comparable to 34th Ave and are successful? Most references are Vanderbilt Ave and if we moved OS to 37th Ave, our commercial avenue with amenities and that is in need of help, we might be on the same playing field. On 34th Ave., it&#039;s so bloated and problematic running through a residential area. In other areas, the OS have been cast aside by unhappy neighbors at a high rate and keeping this status without significant compromise seems delusional at best.

					&nbsp; Some of the posters, like the previous one, sound to me like comrades of a party that limits freedom of speech. Pablum. And as Chickenring stated, there are many people whose anecdotal stories make up a larger number than most posters assume. As those dissenters get their day in court, the right sizing will happen. Isolating people like the 78th st folks who are not getting services because of the closures certainly have a case! Lawsuits are, sadly, the method that we use to get the point across when people are closed to listening to other points of view. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If people who like OS are so opposed to the barriers, why don&#039;t they try other solutions? There are many possibilities. And many residents would welcome a police/security presence on the ave, especially in the dark evenings when JH has traditionally had an uptick in crime. What&#039;s the delay here? And then what about the loss of a viable, several decades old bike lane on 34th Ave?Where is Transportation Alternatives when we need them? What is their plan for our seniors and less abled residents? It&#039;s truly unsafe to drive through people who might be walking the other way unaware there ever was a bike lane because it&#039;s unmarked. Many seniors are so afraid of anyone on e-bikes, they avoid the ave altogether or walk only in groups.<br />&nbsp; The dog pee and poo greenway that used to be the median is a festering problem and no one, repeat no one, should be gardening in there any longer. It&#039;s a petri dish of bacteria and has become a latrine of pet waste running down the avenue. It&#039;s hard to watch how irresponsible the OS has become in terms of the whole neighborhood but in the year of coming lawsuits, we&#039;ll see the outcome. Here&#039;s hoping both sides are finally heard and right sizing, right barriers? are on the way in 2022.<br /><br />

					&nbsp;I believe the thinking for the big ask for all of 34th Ave to be closed imagined that the reality would be a smaller piece. The full stretch was designated as open streets and what many residents now see as overreach is a problem in the neighborhood for many. I do see more and more civil disobedience happening as residents take back the street. The 34th Ave corridor that the DOT meetings seemed to be pushing is a non-starter in Woodside and Corona along 34th no matter how much the cyclists want it. It&#039;s only JH that got stuck with 13hrs a day closures, 7 days a week far outpacing anything resembling Open Streets in all of NYC. Why just us?<br />&nbsp; Sorry for our restaurants too as the word is out that it&#039;s hellish getting here in vehicles now and as one poster said, it&#039;s like driving in midtown. Lots of honking, waiting for multiple lights to advance one block. I hope they can survive on only local patrons as that&#039;s a terrific part of being here in JH having some many great food choices.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

					&nbsp; Yes, OS is a mess. And advocating for change is a middle ground. Whose is in the middle? Not so many OS fans, is what I find sadly. Keep everything as is and in fact, give me more. Many of the 34th Ave residents are pleading for fewer hours, especially in the winter when they have to navigate the streets by foot, bikes, bus or vehicles and it&#039;s dangerous. But come hell or high water, others want the street closures untouched. Is this fair and/or advocating for change?<br /><br />&nbsp; For those residents on 34th ave, the outrageous closure time of not 4-6 or 8 hours but 13 HOURS of barricades to move and it&#039;s truly a hardship. Saw a man with a WW2 hat last week gingerly moving the metal barriers at 76th street last week to get to his garage and saying how frustrated he is with the city not listening to the residents about OS here. Add onto that it&#039;s MORE than 13 hours with trash pickup and street cleaning and these residents are fed up!! 6:15/6:30 garbage cans moving is insult to injury and very noisy!<br /><br />&nbsp; Voter turnout is so low here- I believe the last election was under 20%- that its a useless indicator of how the neighborhood feels about an issue, Open Streets or otherwise. Someone needs to do a fair and impartial assessment of the 34th OS and hopefully, it will not get litigious but it&#039;s certainly looking like it will go that way. <strong>The supporters of OS could compromise at any time...others are listening.</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

					&nbsp;Yes, we need young and old growing in our community. A forest will all the same age trees is vulnerable to extinction. Anecdotally, I notice many students writing essays about their interactions with older folks as a powerful experience in their lives. It&#039;s touching and nice to know it works both ways. Let&#039;s hope this new JH community center is an asset for all.

					&nbsp;Let&#039;s put &quot;facts from the DOT&quot; in quotes. After all, they are the ones that recently put a bike rack in an bird crap covered underpass, have put loading zones in areas of the neighborhood with commercial lots already available (corner of 74th and Northern) and said things in meetings like we don&#039;t have any nearby bike lanes in Jackson Heights and we have a pretty great one on 31st Ave, just over from 34th. Huh? These are their &quot;facts&quot; and that&#039;s why I am mystified by&nbsp; their &quot;facts&quot; because they are anything but true about the neighborhood.<br />&nbsp; Also what genius in the MTA who might be working with the DOT eliminated the bus stop in front of the physical therapy and radiation center and left the ones in front of Dunkin Donuts and the car wash on Northern Blvd? Does these people even visit the area before these changes?More neighborhood mysteries...

					&nbsp;As the OP, I&#039;ve changed my mind plenty. Often issues are presented on this forum and other sources of news and info that do help one sift through the morass. On the particular topic here of the 34th Ave Open Streets, I do feel that facts from the DOT are useless and the many forums and meetings have been mostly a waste of time. The lack of knowledge of the particulars of the were appalling by DOT staff and Jason and others who are paid to smooth things over but not solve anything that is a particular annoyance. Not sure who is responsible but that&#039;s another thread. If the proposed idea about closing Northern Blvd to regular vehicular traffic as proposed by another elected goes anywhere, I hope there is a public forum in which to comment on that.<br /><br />&nbsp;As for changes, I do see some areas where the Open Streets are good as in the morning when the many schools on 34th Ave are inundated with students and parents and it is a zoo, much worse in bad weather too. This opening IS good and helpful. But the thirteen hours!! Just no because it&#039;s not needed and not used. It just isn&#039;t no matter how much people want to say otherwise and cameras posted (which the DOT hasn&#039;t done yet) would detail high/low traffic.<br /><br />&nbsp;For the tired residents of 34th ave and nearby streets, it&#039;s too much. For those who live a few blocks away who think it&#039;s swell, I like to ask what if they closed off your street and dogs peed and pooed everywhere and it became a hazard for less mobile residents and oh god, the dreaded motorized bikes...and they say &quot;Oh my street couldn&#039;t close for this or that reason&quot; or people wouldn&#039;t like that street to be closed...and so on. You don&#039;t hear a loud level of complaining much because most of the people adversely affected are weary, working class residents who feel the time they would take out of their lives to say their thoughts would be a waste of their time. The heavily networked folks - yes, me and Obama like saying folks - are the super loud voices here. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; The little guys are being overlooked and even though some think this is not true and that these comments are obviously biased, I stand by them and do think there is value in repeating the issues. Courage to speak your values is something we could use more of and I personally like a thoughtful debate. FYI two other topics were hotly debated here over the years that did change and one was the use of our many private co-op gardens (which are never counted in the green space debate btw) being available to use for children. And also the segregation of our public schools in JH which is awful for the being touted as such a diverse area, but not now, finally, a mom from IS145 is actively opening that debate again. So change might be slow but it happens.<br />

					&nbsp;Not talking about the two bike racks in front of PS398. Not those. But the one that is so oddly positioned in the underpass of the BQE one block away on the bowling alley side. The school racks are minimally used, usually pink scooters that sometimes spend the weekend there but this one below the highway is absolutely useless. No one in their right mind would use it.<br />&nbsp; Meanwhile, IS230 (several blocks away) has no bike racks, older students, and cyclists chain up their bikes all around the available fences. Does this make any sense to you? Who plans this stuff? Do they just throw darts and put bike racks up wherever?
