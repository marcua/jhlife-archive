				Sadly, its closed.&nbsp; I went at least once a week for takeout shortly after they opened for the vegetable dishes.&nbsp; A few months ago I said to an older man behind the counter after I ordered a 16 oz container of Aloo Gobi, &quot;why are you only charging $5.00 for all this food.&nbsp; You should be charging more.&quot;&nbsp; I wanted this place to survive.&nbsp; He did not respond.&nbsp;

The staff were not overtly friendly, but that&#039;s not something I care too much about. They weren&#039;t rude or insulting, however.<br /><br />The home style dishes were awesome. Maybe you had the American stuff? I will admit the pizza was atrociously bad and the chicken and fries looked awful.

				their kebabs were delicious, and, as JH3525 said, very inexpensive. i also liked their veggie dishes...two small containers and a naan made a great meal. i&#039;ll miss the place.

				Indonesian would be <strong>awesome. </strong><br /><br />While a small portion of their repertoire (Indonesia as an archipelago has dozens of cuisine variants!), good laksa, beef rendang, gado gado and nasi goreng are all superstars in the world pantheon of delicious delicious cooking.<br />
