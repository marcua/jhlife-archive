				<strong>Heightening Stories</strong><br />A new writing workshop in Jackson Heights<br /><br />Wednesday nights, 6:30 pm â€“ 9:30 pm<br /><br />Ten weeks: October 10 â€“ December 19<br /><br />$300<br /><br />Limited to 8 participants<br /><br />â€œHeightening Storiesâ€ is a new community-oriented workshop for creative nonfiction and autobiographical fiction writers to work on stories that are both bravely personal and socially conscious. Held in a supportive environment in the instructor&#039;s home, the weekly sessions will include exercises that will help you analyze contemporary fiction and nonfiction for inspiration, develop new material, give and receive constructive feedback in a group, and learn interview or research skills as necessary. By the end of the ten weeks, you will have completed or revised up to twenty pages of writing (one long piece or a few short essays, stories or chapters) that will be ready to publish.<br /><br />The workshop is designed for writers of all levels to contribute their unique skills to help each other improve; beginners are welcome. To apply, please email nancyagabian@yahoo.com two paragraphs that 1) explain your interest in joining a writing community and 2) describe the writing you would like to do with this group. Attach a 1-3 page sample of writing. Application deadline: October 1, 2012.<br /><br />(On October 3, 7:30 â€“ 9 pm there will be a free informational session for potential members to meet, discuss their interests in the workshop, and give their input in shaping the group&#039;s activities.)<br /><br />About Nancy: I have nearly twenty years experience teaching writing in community. In academia, I&#039;ve taught memoir, personal essay, literary journalism, poetry, fiction and playwriting. Writing and teaching interests include (but aren&#039;t limited to): family histories; social change &amp; justice; performance art and activism; housing design &amp; reform; cross cultural &amp; queer experiences; the intersections of race, class, gender &amp; sexuality in identity; and the personal as political. Former students have gone on to publish, perform, teach, and attend MFA writing programs.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *MFA in Nonfiction Writing from Columbia University<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *Author of the memoir Me as her again: True Stories of an Armenian Daughter, nominated for a Lambda Literary Award and a Saroyan International Writing Prize<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *Instructor of creative writing at Queens College and NYU<br /><br />For more information, please visit http://nancyagabian.com (http://nancyagabian.com) or email nancyagabian@yahoo.com.
