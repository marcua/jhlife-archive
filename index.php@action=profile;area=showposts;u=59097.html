					We all know about <a href="https://www.turbovax.info/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.turbovax.info/</a>, right? It continuously scans all city and state (and I think now pharmacy) sites to show all currently open appointments everywhere on one page. It often mentions which vaccine is given at the site too. If you keep an eye on it, you&#039;ll eventually catch when there&#039;s a massive opening of appointments. You can then just click to link to the city or state website to make your appointment. It saves you the trouble of having to check multiple sites.

					Like the article mentions, this new Lidl is replacing a Best Market. We were getting groceries delivered from Best Market last spring but what&#039;s interesting is that all the paper bags already had Lidl printed on the side. Seems that this transition has been in the works for a while.

Except for the framing. I see the caution not as a <em>restriction </em>of freedom, but as the <em>protection </em>of freedom. Small personal adjustments protect the freedom (read: health and life, rather than illness or death) of our neighbors. A neighborhood with spreading illness and death leads not to personal freedom, but restriction. Taking simple personal precautions protects both my neighbors&#039; freedom and mine.

					I think it&#039;s awesome that these elections are inspiring people to tune into politics more closely. Like they say, if you don&#039;t turn on to politics, politics will turn on you. For serious city/local policy and political stuff, I definitely recommend Gotham Gazette - just a great resource. City &amp; State is good. City Limits is especially excellent, focused on important urban policy and investigatory stuff. If you&#039;re into audio, the editors of Gotham Gazette and City Limits have the podcast Max &amp; Murphy. It is a just goldmine of state and city policy and politics. And as of a couple months ago, it&#039;s airing on WBAI 99.5, once a week I think.<br /><br />For the very local neighborhood news, I feel like that can be tougher, which sucks because it&#039;s so so important. DNAinfo closing last year was a loss. Brooklyn definitely has a lot of local beat reporters. But Queens? If anyone has recommendations here, I&#039;d love to know.

If the info is out of date perhaps we should post the changes here with a request that the Board incorporate them into their web page.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure someone from CB3 monitors this site. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Redge can&#039;t respond to your post because he has been banned from this forum. He had the temerity to respond to a member of our Community Board, who not only disguised his or her name, but failed to reveal that he or she was a member of the Board, in what was an attack on redge for raising questions about how the Board works, including statements that he is immature and out of touch with reality. <br /><br />In fact, the Board member who made those statements sent him a personal message essentially apologising and referring the issues to the Board. <br /><br />Then the owners of this site decided to ban redge from the site, apparently for having had the audacity of asking for the Board member&#039;s real name. <br /><br />One of the results of this is that I don&#039;t ever want to see Toddg in my restaurant, nor anybody else who agrees with how he has addressed this. <br /><br />Frankly, the question now is when I&#039;ll get banned. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First of all, Redge accused the local Community Board of having out of date information regarding liquor licenses.&nbsp; He then proceeded to disparage the Board&#039;s staff for not caring enough to update the information.&nbsp; He continued to attack the Board, which is his right, but after an inspection of the Board&#039;s website I cannot find any information about liquor licenses that is out of date or inaccurate.&nbsp; Redge has the right to be wrong and to fly off on a tangent, but before attacking people who serve this community (many of them on a volunteer basis) it would be nice to see some proof to back it up.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, you conveniently ignore the fact that your investor used this forum to call someone &quot;sleazy,&quot; &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;cowardly.&quot;&nbsp; If Erospolitico is in fact a Community Board member, then he or she should be thanked for volunteering to serve this community.&nbsp; And if he or she wants to participate in this forum anonymously, so be it.&nbsp; Does Redge volunteer his time on behalf of the community.&nbsp; Is &quot;Redge&quot; his real name?<br /><br />Finally, I live right around the corner from your proposed restaurant.&nbsp; Are you really telling me that I&#039;m not allowed in your restaurant because I find the use of the words &quot;sleazy,&quot; &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;cowardly&quot; when directed at a member of this forum to be inappropriate.&nbsp; Is that the message you have for any Jackson Heights residents who agree with me?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think it&#039;s worth reminding my neighbors how Stew has behaved in the past. I am a very very longtime resident, frequent reader of this forum, but someone who rarely posts. I have never, in my years reading this forum, seen someone as completely disrespectful, entitled, and hostile to this community as Stew. I bring up these old posts only because I want to make sure that my neighbors understand who they are dealing with. This is a person who has expressed utter disdain for anyone who does appreciate his brilliant vision, who has used undercover investors to troll this forum, who has disparaged the wealth of food options in this community because their cooks did not study abroad like he did to learn to cook overpriced pretentious dishes, who has preemptively banned people from his restaurant because they express disagreement with him. I already know that most of you will respond negatively to this post. Have at it. I just want to say that I will never forget how Stew expressed his hostility towards this community when first announcing his restaurant and how he attacked people who disagreed with his tactics. This is not the behavior of someone who actually wants to be a part of the community. I am sure Stew lives in a better apartment than me and has studied in more countries than me. I am like the vast vast vast majority of the community -- just trying to get by in a neighborhood where pretense and hostility to your neighbors are no help. Stew, I urge you, abandon this ridiculous project. It will fail. You are too out of touch with your neighbors. Your attitude is too disgusted towards your own community. Open shop somewhere else and learn to live anonymously in the neighborhood you chose to move to, even if you have to stoop to its level.<br /><br /><em><strong>[Moderator&#039;s note: Relocking the thread.&nbsp; You&#039;re entitled to your grudges, but please don&#039;t make us keep re-living this episode.]</strong></em>

					Stopped by there tonight to grab a menu. I was also given a sampler plate for free. Even though I had just had dinner, I finished everything. It was really good. And the people working there were so friendly. It was one of those places where you walk in and already feel like family. I really wish the best for these guys. They have something really unique going it seems.

Several plazas in Manhattan, for instance, are managed and financed by the local Business Improvement District. That means that if your plaza&#039;s BID includes Macy&#039;s or the Flatiron Building and the surrounding real estate, your plazas are going to have a massive infusion of corporate capital aimed at beautifying that area to serve their business. It&#039;s not fair to compare Diversity Plaza to those. That does not mean that it cannot be an attractive place. It&#039;s just important to recognize that in a neighborhood like Jackson Heights, the capital improvements are going to be fairly standard fare -- how the plaza is programmed or maintained is up to you and me and any partners we choose to bring in.

					I am not nor have I ever been a supporter or voter of Crowley. This is because of two simple words: Iraq Resolution. The minority of Democratic congresspeople who voted Yea on this (82 vs. 126 Nay) should have been tarred, feathered, and removed from decision-making power a very long time ago. This consequences of this vote resonate around the world to this day. And reasonable people can argue that we would not be living in the land of Cult 45 were it not for that stupid invasion.
