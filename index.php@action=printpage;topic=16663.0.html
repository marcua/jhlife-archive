				Somehow my sister found this online this week. I don&#039;t remember this Class Photo ever being taken even though I&#039;m in it! My mother was too cheap to ever give me the money to buy these Class Photos. I recognize about 30% of my classmates in it. This was the class where at about 2:40 on Friday a female teacher suddenly without warning burst into our classroom,&nbsp; whispered something into Mr. Hartstein&#039;s ear and Mr. Hartstein suddenly turned completely white, a look I&#039;ve never seen before or since and silently walked to the blackboard and wrote in block letters &quot;President Kennedy Has Been Shot&quot;. I was the blackboard monitor and he asked me to erase it about 2 minutes later as we were dismissed 15 or so minutes early. Like an idiot, many of us played punchball right afterwards in the schoolyard.<br /><br />If anyone has an email address for one of the girls in the photo, Barbara Marus, would appreciate it as I always wanted to thank her for &quot;Taking&quot; one of Mr. Hartstein&#039;s demerits for me which would have been my 4th one and a phone call/letter to my parents. Until recently I always thought her last name was spelled Maris like Roger Maris and wasted time Googling this nonexistent name. Nowadays these kids in school can stab their teachers and they won&#039;t get in trouble and I was about to get a demerit for whispering something during class to the classmate next to me!(http://)<br /><br />
