				Wow, was this event created specifically for me?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been craving giving biking another try lately.&nbsp; They had a free biking opportunity at Governor&#039;s Island and on Park Avenue over the summer, but I never made it.&nbsp; But this is great.&nbsp; So, much more convenient!&nbsp; Has this been going on every week less a block away from where I live and I haven&#039;t known about it? :-(<br /><br />I have a distinct recollection of being at Traver&#039;s Park with my training wheels once long, long ago, and that&#039;s it.&nbsp; I tried a few times when I was older (in Long Island visiting cousins; in my high school&#039;s yard)&nbsp; but I never got used to doing it.&nbsp; Are there many others of you out there who don&#039;t know how to bike?

				I can just about promise you a fabulous experience! I&#039;ve volunteered a couple times for Bike New York, Learn to Ride programs for kids. They are a great organization, and have a very simple and effective teaching method. Plus, all of the staff that I&#039;ve met are super friendly, kind, and really love doing these teach ins. I hope you both make it. I may volunteer again, if I can free up that Sunday. <br />Learn to ride! You&#039;ll be amazed how close Astoria, Queens Center Mall, Flushing Meadows Park, and a million other places are, once you&#039;ve got wheels!!!!<br /><br />DOT recently announced that cycling is up 30% city wide. This statistic is helping to advance issues of safety and access for all!!!! To quote a phrase, Bike for better biking!<br /><br />Go for it!!! There will be so many opportunities to ride those bikes once you feel comfortable!!

				Check out the Bike New York website for other dates/locations for Lucas. If not, I can teach him. I did two &quot;teach a kid to ride&quot; sessions over the summer. The technique involves taking the pedals off, and getting the kid to push off until he feels comfortable balancing and steering the bike. Then put the pedals back on and run behind them, holding only the seat. Do that between 20 and 300 times and they&#039;ll get it! My kids learned in about 2 to 3 hours.

				And as a footnote, as I worked the playstreet today, I watched the bikers-to-be.&nbsp; Luc didn&#039;t even have his bike this weekend, it was left at the grandparents, so he just scooted through the crowds.&nbsp; I may take you up on that lesson thing though ... they said this was the last class until 2009 ... :(

				I was one of these bikers-to-be and I had a great time!&nbsp; The volunteers were so supportive and made me feel very good about learning.&nbsp; I walked away with a solid ability to pedal and eagerness to keep at it!&nbsp; Now I&#039;m going to see if any bike owners trust me with their bikes to practice some more with and then I might even buy myself one for the spring.

				You may have seen me if you were there from 9 to 11:30 ... I was there with the mob of play street kids that made the fort under the art table and charged the huge leaf pile.<br /><br />But you and the others riders-to-be looked confident.&nbsp; Way to go!

				Oh yeah, I saw a few dads around.&nbsp; Did you have Nikon camera with you?&nbsp; The kids looked like they were having so much fun in that leaf pile!&nbsp; A couple of times I thought I was going to ruin that fun by running them over with my bike, but lucky for everyone I avoided creating such a catastrophe.&nbsp; Before coming out this Sunday I didn&#039;t see much of a point in having&nbsp; 78th closed off, but now I see the draw.&nbsp; Hooray for the 78th Play Street!

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Emilia from Bike New York here.&nbsp; Thanks for all of the positive feedback regarding our adult Learn to Ride class at the Jackson Heights Play Street.&nbsp; We had a wonderful time with the exceptional students who attended that session.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we don&#039;t have any more classes scheduled for the 2008 season (weather is so unpredictable and turn-out tends to drop off quite a bit).&nbsp; Our 2009 class schedule will be posted on our website soon.&nbsp; Check out www.bikenewyork.org.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don&#039;t have an email list announcing classes per-se, but you can email me at emiliac@bikenewyork.org and you&#039;ll be added to our quarterly Bicycle Education Program e-newsletter, which includes class dates.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for your interest and support of our program!&nbsp;
