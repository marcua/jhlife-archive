				Have been missing them badly.<br /><br />If Phayul pushed them out, it would be a real shame. Especially since Phayul already has their location across the street. Personally, Amdo’s steamed beef momos are my favorite in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Wonder if they can set up somewhere else nearby. Also think their steamed beef momos are much better than any of the other carts and trucks nearby.

				I agree their beef momos are the best. Really hope they find a new spot soon. It was my go to pre-dinner snack on the way home from work. BRING BACK AMDO!!!

				Thanks.&nbsp; I found the number on yelp and called.&nbsp; The person who answered told me they are no longer operating.&nbsp; They said they hope to possibly find a storefront somewhere.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if that will happen but I really hope they do.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is terrible news for my addiction.&nbsp; I have been trying other places but nothing is quite Amdo.&nbsp;

				Have you tried Potala across the street (https://potalarestaurantjacksonheights.com/), or Lhasa Fast Food?&nbsp; &nbsp;Their beef momos are really quite good. <br /><br />I loved Amdo too, but mostly because they were fast.&nbsp; &nbsp;At most of the other places in the neighborhood, you&#039;ll have to wait for a few minutes.&nbsp;

Really miss that bit of broth inside along with that killer hot sauce and fermented radish from Amdo. Hope they can set up somewhere<br /><br />Potala truck’s are too doughy, Mom’s the flavors just aren&#039;t the same, though the pan-fried are pretty good. Potala Restaurant has excellent veggie momos - will have to try their beef. <br />

				Yes, I&#039;ve tried both Potala and Lhasa.&nbsp; Both are good but as said, not quite Amdo.&nbsp; Amdo was quick, which was key.&nbsp; Also, EastsideJH hit the nail on the head:&nbsp; The broth, hot sauce, and fermented radish elevated the whole experience for me.&nbsp; And like I said, it was quick, so I would not lose twenty minutes getting off the train for a snack before dinner.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nepali Banchar was great, had that the other day.&nbsp; Potala truck I agree is too doughy.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; I will keep looking but I feel there is an opportunity for Amdo to come back because now that they are gone, it&#039;s clear they offered something different from some of the other shops.
