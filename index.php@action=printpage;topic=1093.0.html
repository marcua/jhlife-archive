				A better thread would be: &quot;What is the difference between Columbian, Peruvian, Ecuadorian and Argentinian Food&quot;?<br /><br />Really, I&#039;d like to know. They all seem to be identical menus.<br /><br /><strong><em>[Note from Moderator:&nbsp; This discussion has been relocated to this new thread from elsewhere.]</em></strong>

				Spanishfish, I&#039;ll concede that Peruvian and Ecuadorian food is similar, but Argentinean food is very different.&nbsp; Peru and Ecuador are recognized for their seafood offerings whereas Argentinean focuses more on beef.&nbsp; Some Argentinean restaurants also have Italian items on their menus.&nbsp; Colombian food...hmmmm....steaks, sancochos, rice, beans and stews.

				I&#039;ve been trying to learn more about this topic, too.&nbsp; We have a lot of national and regional cuisines in this neighborhood, but to the non-spanish-speaking outsider like me it takes a while to be able to understand the specialties and differences.<br /><br />We already have a great thread providing some of the specialties of Ecuadorian cuisine (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=389.0).<br /><br />We don&#039;t have much on this site about the other cuisines, but Wikipedia has some good information on Peruvian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_cuisine), Colombian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_cuisine), and Argentinian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Argentina) cuisine.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also learned a lot reading Seth Kugel&#039;s Nueva York (http://www.nuevayorkguide.com/) blog.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t remember any of it when I need to!<br /><br />Can anybody here point us in the direction of their favorites? <br /><br />Perhaps since we already have other threads on favorite restaurants from these various areas, we can focus here on discussion of dishes (and recipies!) more generally.&nbsp; <br />

				Okay I am going to break it easier for people. Ecuador and Peru the food is broken by the part of peru you are in. For example Heartier meals always come from people that live close to mountains or just plains type of people that area&#039;s usually called &quot;la sierra&quot; which is usually cold to moderately warm at time even hot. Now the tropical area know as &quot; la Costa&quot; is where they are more prevalent in seafood which dishes are just as delicious so people understand a bit more both countries don&#039;t just eat seafood. <br /><br />So next time you eat at these place and if you notice just Seafood that means the people or the owner of the place is most likely from the beaches or tropical areas.<br /><br />now if you are eating heartier meals like pork, cow tripe, stews those people are more from &quot;la Sierra&quot;<br /><br />I hope that helps and everyone understands the food much better.

				Similarly, Colombian food is also divided by regions. The areas near the Atlantic coast are primarily seafood-based. (Omigod, heavenly fresh grilled fish and coconut rice!) The interior regions have distinctive styles and are mostly meat-based. Grilled meats appear to be a specialty of the Llanos region - there were excellent restaurants in Colombia specializing in llanera style meats cooked on a vertical spit over an open fire. Other national dishes like the bandeja paisa and the ajiaco (a kind of soup with chicken and other root veggies) seem very similar to dishes found all over Central and South America.
