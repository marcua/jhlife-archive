				My husband and I just wrapped up a kitchen and bath gut renovation, and cannot say enough amazing things about the team that pulled it together. I know that Eddie Corrigan&#039;s name has popped up here a number of times (which is actually how we found him), and we were incredibly impressed with his work. His team was both gracious and extremely competent. They were tidy in their work and respectful of our neighbors (which is particularly important when renovating a fifth floor walkup). <br /><br />We also worked with Emily Butler of Emily Butler Interiors to help design the spaces. Besides her own apartment, it was the first apartment that she worked on in the neighborhood, and her vision for our space - which had some major structural constraints - was masterful. She maximized the storage in a very tight room, and even managed to get a washer/dryer into the design. Beyond being exceptionally talented, she was also a wonderful thought partner and super responsive throughout the process.<br /><br />I cannot recommend them enough! Eddie of Corrigan Service Corp. can be reached at 917-748-3620. I know that he gets extremely busy, so if you have the flexibility to book him a few months out, that makes a difference! Emily can be contacted through her website at emilybutler.com.<br /><br />

				I have known Eddie for over 32 years, when I had my kitchen finally redone after procrastinating about it for years, there was no one who I wanted for the job except Eddie and his crew. It was a great experience, despite the dust and construction that always comes with a gut renovation, but I am thrilled with the results,

				Had our kitchen done by Ed about 4 years ago.&nbsp; Now working on getting our bathroom done by him.&nbsp; His crew did a great job.&nbsp; They are also known by a lot of the buildings in JH and have the right insurance if your building has a picky management company (our&#039;s does) which can be a real help getting the job done.
