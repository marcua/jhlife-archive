				My son took a photo of a Hawk that had a recently killed pigeon in its claws. The picture was taken on 37th Avenue around 83rd or 84th Street a few weeks ago. Has anyone else seen this magnificent bird? Is it likely to become a permanent resident? Can we encourage it to move on to squirrels?<br /><br />(With any luck I will post the picture)

				I saw him a few months ago but further west. Nothing like walking out of your apartment on a Spring morning and having a severed pigeon head plop at your feet.&nbsp; ;D

				there are always a couple of families of hawks, and a couple of families of falcons, living here. they like the turrets of the buildings that have them. the spanish styled, towers-like one near Joan of Arc and the houses on 75th street in particular. my ex and i owned one of those and had hawks living in the top porch ... they left squirrel parts all over the yard! :)

				hfm, jd143 is just a troll who posts here once in a while (I have a sneaking suspicion it&#039;s a sock puppet account for another person here who shall remain nameless).

				He lights on my fire escape sometimes. When I&#039;m working at home I see him. I only managed to get a few blurry photos. Every time I hold my camera up to the window, he takes off.

				We just saw a hawk a few days ago.... magnificent!&nbsp; A rare treat to see one in the City (and hopefully it will keep the pigeon population down.)

				my only issue with our hawks - there are a few, along with falcons and kestrels - is that they&#039;re messy eaters. when we owned a home, as opposed to an apartment, i&#039;d find squirrel tails and other a la carte toss-offs lying around the yard all the time.
