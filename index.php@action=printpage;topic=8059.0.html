				I am thinking of trying Fresh Direct.&nbsp; Is there anything special I should know about the groceries or ordering or delivery process before doing so?&nbsp; &nbsp;How much do you tip the drivers?&nbsp; If you live in a coop and have used them in the past, does your coop require that they deliver the groceries through the service entrance?&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks.

				I&#039;ve used them and they are very nice. I tip depending upon how many boxes. Never more than $5.<br /><br />Delivery through main door. They are good about being on time during your assigned time slot.

				I get a free delivery code for them every other week or so, that&#039;s the only time that I ever get FD.&nbsp; The codes seem to be based on neighborhood because friends who live elsewhere haven&#039;t been able to use them.&nbsp; Overall I&#039;ve been pleased with it - everything is fresh, and prices are on par - or better than - the local stores.

				I tip around $3 dollars (they&#039;ve done a good job consolidating their boxes- there used to be too many). They send free delivery codes via email regularly if you order from them which is nice (though if you go a couple of weeks without ordering the codes stop appearing for awhile). Some of their fruit is overpackaged, but I&#039;m happy with them. There&#039;s some things that you can get cheaper if you look, but I think overall they&#039;re cheaper than Walbaums, (I once did a side by side comparison between FD and PeaPod, and was impressed with how well FD came out) and have good, varied products.<br /><br />Two things:<br />-Review your order to make sure that you don&#039;t have doubles of anything. Sometimes I put things in my cart, continue shopping, and forget that I got something, order it again, and then miss that I have multiples.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Look at Presidents Picks and Grocery Deals for stuff on sale. Some of the sales are really good, especially for end of season fruit.

				Thanks for the advice so far. &nbsp;If anyone else reading this is also thinking of becoming a new customer, there&#039;s a current promotion for new customers only to save $100 off the first two orders (save $50 per order) if you place the first two orders by March 19, 2013. &nbsp;The promotion code is DMGP6. &nbsp;The minimum for each order is $125 before taxes or delivery fees.
