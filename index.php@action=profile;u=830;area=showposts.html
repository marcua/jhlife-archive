					I agree that the subway station is the best place to hear multiple languages at one point, perpaps the Post Office.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is due to the fact that although very diverse, Jackson Heights is not very homogenized.&nbsp; The pot has not melted here, as this if so often an entry point for fairly recent immigrants, and by a generation they have moved on.&nbsp; At times in the past we have had waves of Irish, Russian and Polish, Colombians, etc.&nbsp; So one block will be very different than the next, but within the block it is not very diverse. Of course each wave left a few permanent residents.<br /><br />I noted this one night walking home from the Vietnamese Rest. on 74th a little south of Broadway (excellent by the way).&nbsp; That block was almost all oriental.&nbsp; Going north only a half block to Roosevelt, it was primarily Mexican, going another half block Indian and related backgrounds, turning right on 37th Ave and going a block got me back to primarily Latino, and turning north on 77th, a mix of yuppies and related folks, with few of the previously mentioned groups.&nbsp; Had I continued to Northern, it would have been primarily people from South America.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is what I love about Jackson Heights.<br /><br />

					You are correct on turnout.&nbsp; Montserrate is well funded and organized.&nbsp; He will turn out his area.&nbsp; I strongly support Francisco Moya not only as a vote against Montserrate and all he stands for, but because I have met Moya three times and he sounds outstanding.&nbsp; Great qualifications and the support in Albany to get things done for Jackson Heights and the state.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with an earlier post that said we need to send a message not only to Montserrate but future politicians that we will not tolerate that behavior.&nbsp; <br /><br />Turnout is crucial, not only in this office, but if in the future Albany is short one piece on cake (and they always are), it will be the district that doesn&#039;t vote that eats no cake.<br /><br />Tom Russell

					Politics is often a matter of limited choices.&nbsp; I have met Francisco Moya and was very favorably impressed.&nbsp; However, the reality is that Monsserate is very well organized, has loyal supporters in his neighborhood that WILL turn out, and is well financed.&nbsp; At the recent Colombian Election in May, I saw a dozen people with Monsserate signs, with a lot of energy.&nbsp; Even though it may seem silly that he would be re-elected given his past, the truth is that our district has one of the lowest turnout rates in the city, thus a few organized loyalists could put Monsserate back in, as it doesn&#039;t take that many votes to win.&nbsp; If we in Jackson Heights don&#039;t turn out, don&#039;t whine.&nbsp; And you can bet he will remember where his support came from.&nbsp;

					In four years we have used them for various reasons (too old being the root reason) probably 30 times.&nbsp; I have never seen a yellow cab when needed.&nbsp; The rate quoted was within a dollar of average, even when late at night and few options were available.&nbsp; Never had a problem.&nbsp; Often I don&#039;t even ask the rate, and it stays normal.&nbsp; They blow their horns at traffic congestion is my complaint, but that is easy to quiet down by threatening to turn them in to the taxi commission. Glad they are there when I want them!

					I saw the helicopter, it was NYPD flying very fast, low and at very tight turns, so it was highly banked.&nbsp; Very risky flying and very close to glide path of LaGuardia.&nbsp; Nothing to be seen that low and fast, so I assumed it was just showboating to impress either a passenger or someone on the ground, but exposed a lot of people to threat of death for no reason I could see.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I have yet to see our local raptors, but have enjoyed them most of my life.&nbsp; I am from Louisiana and every winter we got a lot of hawks migrating through.&nbsp; I have seen two kills, one in my backyard of a&nbsp; dove.&nbsp; <br /><br />The British School of Falcon in Manchester VT offers a class in falconry, using Harris Hawks.&nbsp; I took one class and it was great.&nbsp; I got to fly a hawk and then we went on a woods walk where the hawk follows along thru the trees.&nbsp; Each person has his own hawk.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Price was reasonable, I thought, considering how unusual this is.&nbsp; There is the Equinox resort that is related to it, which is a fine old resort, but you can stay in a cheaper place, or just make it a day trip.&nbsp; Driving time about 3 hours.<br /><br />Cajunnewyorker
