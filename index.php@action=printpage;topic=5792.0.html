				In order to keep the doors open Queens Pride House launched its SAVE QUEENS PRIDE HOUSE campaign.&nbsp; Through a combination of austerity, volunteers, new funding, and fundraising we have pushed the viability of the center forward one year!&nbsp; We exceeded our fundraising goal in 2010 and raised $12,000!&nbsp; Our goal for 2011 is $20,000.<br /><br />Queens Pride House announces the appointment of a new interim executive director.<br /><br />Article from Queens Chronicle:<br /><br />Queens Pride House gets new director<br />by Elizabeth Daley, Editor<br />Queens Chronicle<br />1.20.2011<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; After more than a decade of service to the organization, Daniel Castellanos stepped down as executive director of Queens Pride House on Monday, the organization announced. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanos helped found the only lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community center in the borough in 1997 and led the organization since April 2009. He will be succeeded by Peter Pavich as interim executive director. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œIâ€™ve been with Queens Pride House since the beginning,â€ Castellanos said in a statement. â€œItâ€™s now time for me to move on, as I focus my efforts on finishing my dissertation,â€ he added. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanos is pursuing a doctorate in public health at Columbia University and has received a fellowship to write his doctoral thesis on homeless youth of color as he prepares to embark upon a new career as a health researcher. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œI would like to thank Daniel for his many years of service to Queens Pride House,â€ said Pauline Park, president of the board of directors, who, along with Castellanos and Treasurer Charles Ober, are the only three original founding members of the organization still directly involved in its operations. â€œDaniel will be missed,â€ Ober said. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanosâ€™ successor, Pavich, has spent the last six years as the executive director of Helping Hands Unlimited, a Brooklyn-based HIV/AIDS housing provider, as well as president and CEO of Pavich Consultants, a grant writing a program development firm. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich will be working with QPH on a short-term basis while the board searches for a permanent director. â€œPeter has enormous experience in program and organizational development,â€ Park said, adding that it will be nice to have his perspective regarding the organization and its future. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich has developed HIV prevention programs for elders, youth and members of the LGBT community. He is an entrepreneur and enjoys leading organizations during transitional phases, Park said. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œPeterâ€™s experience as interim executive director of the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Community Center of Central Florida is of particular relevance in his work for Queens Pride House,â€ said Ober in a statement. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich received a bachelorâ€™s degree in nursing from the University of Florida in 1991, his masterâ€™s degree in public health from the University of South Florida in 1994, and a Ph.D. in public health from New York University in 2006. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Park said QPH is working with Pavich to develop a timeline for his service. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Queens Pride House is located in Jackson Heights and serves more than 6,000 clients and conducts health support, education and referral programs, youth training, and cultural and social programming. To obtain more information about the organization and its services visit queenspridehouse.org or call (718) 429-5309. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />FILE PHOTO: Daniel Castellanos <br /><br />http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20454597&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6<br />

				Queens Pride House continues their fundraising efforts with dances that are approximately quarterly, and of course their monthly events continue, like their community potluck. View my pictures of two of their April events: their community potluck and their Spring Fling fundraiser.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 20pt;" class="bbc_size">http://on.fb.me/iI0nII (http://on.fb.me/iI0nII)</span></div><br />Here are three sample pictures, but there are many others.<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/264073_10150278711059108_510279107_8964990_5786227_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/269587_10150299086284108_510279107_9056199_3383139_n.jpg)<br /><br />(http://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/261363_10150304104729108_510279107_9121008_1274573_n.jpg)</div>
