				Very excited that we now have a vegan vendor at the farmers market!! I believe all items are also gluten free. He said today was his first day. Hoping he brings more options next week!!

				Body And Soul Bake Shop. I tried the items I purchased and they were a bit dry-probably due to be gluten free. I also checked out their website and noticed I was overcharged. My items were clearly marked with the prices as well. Not too sure how I feel about them now. Perhaps it was an honest mistake. The man running the stand was lovely to chat with.

				bellabella, I made the same mistake.<br /><br />Awhile back I bragged to a friend about how good one of those baked goods sellers were--and they are--and to prove how good it was I bought him a muffin, not knowing it was gluten free. My friend thought I was out of my mind; it fell apart in the hand and stuck in the mouth. <br /><br />Be glad you don&#039;t have to eat gluten free.<br /><br />but happy for those that do and now have more gluten free options.

				I bought some overpriced cookies to be supportive of a new vendor. I ate two bites and threw away the rest of the bag. Dry, dry, and over-baked. Not a good start for this nice guy.....then again, who can compete with the Hawthorne Farms scones and brownies??? Especially the latter. I guess it&#039;s nice to have an option for people who can&#039;t eat gluten, but this baker needs to step it up. Ovenly in Greenpoint makes terrific gluten-free goodies, many of which are on sale at Espresso 77. Love the Pistachio bread. Signed, serious Sweet Tooth.
