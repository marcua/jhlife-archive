			I&#039;ve been living in the neighborhood for a little over 30 years now, and have witnessed many interesting changes in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Just along the strip of 37th Avenue, along the 70s, there&#039;s been so much turnover in businesses and at the same time, we&#039;ve also had a few that have held their ground.&nbsp; Here are a few for those that may be curious:<br /><br />Courtesy Drug Store then a Rockbottom Pharmacy where the now Commerce Bank is located at 74th Street<br /><br />Key Food Supermarket where the now Duane Reade is located at 73rd Street<br /><br />Pizza Boy pizzeria -- seems like they&#039;ve been there for quite a while...at least since the mid-1970s<br /><br />Large liquor store on the southwest corner of 37th and 75th Street<br /><br />Decent fish market next door to Dunkin Donuts on 37th Ave<br /><br />Lousy fish market on the northeast corner of 78th Street and 37th Ave<br /><br />Used bookstore (very quaint) -- on 37th Ave., somewhere between 77th and 78th Street approx.<br /><br />Fur coat storage and cleaning service, next door to bookstore mentioned above<br /><br />Brandon&#039;s trinket shop on 37th near Baskin Robbins - also very quaint.&nbsp; <br /><br />Trade Fair was another supermarket in those days.&nbsp; It seemed to cater more to the neighborhood elderly and always seemed to be poorly stocked.<br /><br />Met was also a supermarket (Shop Wise).&nbsp; If you think it&#039;s bad now, you should have seen it back then.<br /><br />Social Security Office maintained a branch on Roosevelt Avenue where the large 99 cent store is now located<br /><br />Mom and Pop butcher shop on 74th Street before Roosevelt Avenue<br /><br />Lamston&#039;s shop (similar to Woolworth&#039;s) on 74th Street<br /><br />Another Key Food supermarket on 74th Street<br /><br />Stationery and school supplies store on 74th Street<br /><br />Mature woman&#039;s garment shop on 74th Street<br /><br />Photo developing shop on 74th Street<br /><br />Hardware/Houseware shop on 74th Street<br /><br />2 Floor Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd Street<br /><br />WOW!&nbsp; I think 74th Street has seen the biggest change.&nbsp; Anyone out there want to add some more?&nbsp; It would be interesting to know what existed even earlier.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

			I saw a Pizza Boy delivery car the other night. I was wondering it if was the same one. <br /><br />Don&#039;t forget the Lamston&#039;s that use to be on 74th Street and the Colony Theater on 82nd street (I used to work there as an usher was &quot;Stop or My Mom Will Shoot&quot; too many times to remember).

			Oops saw you mentioned Lamstons.&nbsp; There used to be the Discount Books where the Realty store is on 77th Street and the old antique/thrift ship&nbsp; &nbsp;that used to be next to the newspaper store on 75th street.

			I&#039;m born and raised in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I went to PS 69 and IS 145 when they were literally half the size they are now. <br /><br />Across the St. from PS 69 there used to be a Sizzler where the Jewish Community Center now stands. <br /><br />The liquor store mentioned above was actually on 73rd st. It was Sam&#039;s Liquor Store, Sam always&nbsp; gave me pennies when I went in there with my father. <br /><br />On the corner of 73rd St. and 37th road where Kabbab King is now, there used to be a place called Dumbarton Oaks, it was a stripper bar but prior to that it was actually a respectable restaurant (or so I&#039;ve been told).<br /><br />On the same block just past the Eagle (or Earle) theater there was a pizza shop, Benny and Tony were the father son team that ran the place. Sal&#039;s barber shop (now on 76th st.) was also there. Sal still cuts my hair some times. A tiny little deli that never seemed to do any business, and The Magic Touch an old style gay bar. Across the st. there was a type writer repair show. which lasted for the longest time and I believe was replaced by a travel agent. <br /><br />Going west on Broadway where the Korean Market is now, there used to be an A&amp;P.<br /><br />One more block west at 72nd and Broadway there was Gibbons, an Irish bar &amp; restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over to 37th ave. near 79th St. where Novo currently is was Barrs Toy store. Next to it where the Starbucks is allegedly going was a bridal shop.<br /><br />On the South side of 37th ave between 74th and 75th there was a Carvel Ice Cream store. <br /><br />The building that currently houses The Renaissance Charter School on 37th ave between 81st and 82nd used to be C&amp;S a horrible department store that no one ever went to.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a candy store on the South East corner of 82nd St. <br /><br />The Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd st. was indeed 2 floors and had a diner in it. <br /><br />On Northern Boulevard next to the Mark Twain Diner there used to be an Arby&#039;s.&nbsp; Where Rite Aid is now there was a C-Town. <br /><br />On 76th St. just behind a small car lot there used to be Northern Lanes. Our other bowling alley. <br /><br />Natives on 83rd and Northern used to be a movie theatre. <br /><br />That&#039;s all that comes to mind at the moment.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />
