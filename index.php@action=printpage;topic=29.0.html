				I&#039;ve been interested in checking out the Lent-Riker-Smith Homestead in Jackson Heights but haven&#039;t gotten around to it yet. Here is the link http://www.rikerhome.com/<br /><br />built in 1654, it&#039;s believed to be the oldest dwelling in America.<br /><br />Another good resource is the Queens Historical Society http://www.queenshistoricalsociety.org/about.html<br /><br />edited to add: I see that the forgotten ny site has some photos of the Lent-Riker-Smith house.

				Here&#039;s another interesting nugget: The Queens Children&#039;s Museum, founded in Jackson Heights in the 1930s.&nbsp; Besides this one article, there are few other references to this museum in the New York Times archive... the latest appears to be in 1939.&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s also a brief reference to a museum by the same name in Forest Hills in the 1950s... don&#039;t know if they&#039;re one and the same.<br /><br />http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00816F73F5A157A93C2A8178AD85F438385F9<br />The New York Times<br />CHILD&#039;S MUSEUM THRIVES IN QUEENS; 700 Children of the Borough Flock to Institution Set Up in Jackson Heights.<br />By HELEN DALLAS<br />January 10, 1937,<br /><br />A new link in the chain of children&#039;s museums established throughout the world in the last thirty years has been added in Greater New York. It is the Children&#039;s Museum of Queens, situated in Jackson Heights but already drawing young habitues from all parts of the borough.<br /><br />Like other children&#039;s museums, it is a cross between class time and play time for the youngsters, who come in after school hours to attend its art and science courses....<br /><br />Unlike other children&#039;s museums, the Queens institution is one in which &quot;mothers&quot; have played a major part.&nbsp; Late in 1935 the Parents Association of Public School 69 in Queens asked Miss Anna Billings Gallup of the Brooklyn Children&#039;s Museum, a pioneer in the movement, to lecture to them.<br /><br />Then there were committee sessions and visits to the Children&#039;s Museum of Brooklyn.&nbsp; Public-spirited citizens were called upon for donations; organizations were solicited for charter membership fees; and finally last April the doors of two small stores, at 79-09, 79-11 Thirty-seventh Avenue, were opened to admit the first children to the officially chartered Children&#039;s Museum of Queens....<br /><br /><br />

				Also interesting because I never knew when teh street numbers switched over.&nbsp; I grew up on 76th which was also called 19th in the original co-op documents.&nbsp; If the address of the Museum was 79-09 in April 1936, it has to be before then.
