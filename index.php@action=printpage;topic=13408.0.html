				This article is a good reminder that is has been a year and a half since we&#039;ve updated our list of cool things going on around Queens.&nbsp; &nbsp;We should really update and refresh our Ongoing Activities (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=115.0) page.&nbsp; If you know of something out there that should be added, please post it here!

				I can&#039;t help but notice that the three main places mentioned, smorgasburg, food and flea, and riis park, are all being run as a spinoff of something already created in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I would hate to see the borough become that.&nbsp; A reflection.&nbsp; Good news for real estate agents though.
