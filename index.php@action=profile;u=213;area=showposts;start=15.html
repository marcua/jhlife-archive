					APG7714,<br /><br />You are right about Singapore. &nbsp;It happened to have a high fine against littering. &nbsp; So Singapore might not be a good example.&nbsp; But&nbsp; there are many other countries that are clean not because of the fine, but people respect the public space. &nbsp;It is no doubt that the difference of standard exists in different countries and in different culture. A country is much poor than the other yet the streets are kept cleaner that the richer, also&nbsp; because of their cultural value. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Once you actually start going outside the US, you would probably understand it. &nbsp;

					Thank you dssjh,<br /><br />I would suggest to go there after 9PM and next morning like 7AM.&nbsp; Then, you will see about the source of filth.&nbsp; <br />My opinion come from my experience of&nbsp; walking down the road everyday for 5 years and have witnessed who is responsible for the mess.&nbsp; If you talk to the super of the coop on the street, they will tell you exactly the same things.&nbsp; Yet, some people don&#039;t want to believe this.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I really appreciate you taking action.&nbsp; I will start taking more photos of 73rd since I walk everyday. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					This is what I have been telling in this board and I am glad finally residents around 73rd st. speak up.<br />73rd street DO need serious help.&nbsp; We have a serious noise, and pollution problem.&nbsp; Almost every night, there are huge group of South Asian hanging around and leave so much litter every night.&nbsp; And it creates traffic congestions.&nbsp; 73rd street looks very chaos and give the impression that city or police don&#039;t care about it, which will attract crimes..&nbsp; yes, report by NY1 would be a great help.

					I didn&#039;t say that the vendors are the main factor of the garbage.&nbsp; But definetely, it is a contributing factor.<br />because<br /><br />1.&nbsp; They sell their foods with plastic food container<br />2. It attracts people in a smaller area which would bring more garbage<br />3. People eats their food with coffee and other drinks sitting in the private property or street and leave their garbage there.<br /><br /><br />I understand that it is the people who litter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ulitimately, what we need is education about civic sense and teach that littering is bad thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was fortunate to visit South Indian countries and I can see that littering is almost like part of their culture.&nbsp; I even saw some south asian guy saying that seeing garbage on the street makes him feel like home and laugh.&nbsp; <br /><br />But meanwhile, I believe that controlling the vendors would help clean the environment for our community.&nbsp;
