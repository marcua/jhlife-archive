				If both Walgreens and Superfresh couldn&#039;t make a go of this location, why would Aldi do any better?

				I&#039;ve been expecting Superfresh to close.&nbsp; I visited at least 10 times since they opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;On each visit, there were more employees then customers and this is not an exaggeration.&nbsp; The last visit was this past Sunday.&nbsp;

				A little sad as it&#039;s a wee bit nicer than other stores in the area.&nbsp; Unfortunately, prices were generally higher and I imagine that kept most people away.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Agree. It&#039;s sad that we can&#039;t have a nicer store to shop in here but the prices were higher and that news went around the community very early on. I believe someone with a more unique product or approach could make a go of it though. The TJ&#039;s in LIC, for example, is pretty busy in a smallish space<br />and I think that could work here.

				Is this the newer Superfresh in the 70s, or the one that (I think?) has been there a while, around 88th St?<br /><br />Or am I wrong that there are two Superfresh stores on Northern?

				This is the Superfresh in the 70s.&nbsp; There is another Superfresh over behind the new Target and Chipotle on 82nd Street.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe there is a Superfresh on Northern around 88th.&nbsp;

I would <strong>love</strong> a TJs there, but they are so popular, and in a car-centric neighborhood, that tiny 15-car parking lot and corner would be a <em>nightmare</em>.<br /><br />The place that would have been great is the old Modells on 31st Ave. Big parking lot! But instead there is an autozone going in. Sigh. <br /><br />

				Yeah, even if it was an Aldi I&#039;m not certain I&#039;d go there on the regular. Then again, this store was nice, just oddly expensive.. oh well.

I was thinking of what I now realize is a Key Food, at around 87th. It is actually a pretty nice market so I think I thought it was a Superfresh.
