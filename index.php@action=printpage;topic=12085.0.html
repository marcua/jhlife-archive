				Hello I am about to get a Brussels Griffon puppy and was wondering if the good people could recommend an excellent vet nearby (have a car). Also wondering where are good spots to socialize him such as a dog run? Thank you!

				If you have a car, then I&#039;d suggest Dr. Hatzi at All Pets in Astoria. Everyone there is fantastic. <br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/all-pets-veterinary-care-corp-queens<br /><br />Congrats on your new dog!

				Welcome to JH. We are very happy with Dr Tello and his co-worker Dr. Crawford. A friend called them &quot;naturalists&quot;<br />in their approach to vet care. Tiny office but great staff all the way around with superb care. The JH dog run on 69th <br />street is fun. Try the 5:30- 6:30 pm time if you can for most dogs inside.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I will second a recommendation for Doctor Tello&#039;s office- very friendly and helpful staff. The dog run at 69th is alright, but if you have a car I&#039;d recommend going to Sherry Park down at Queens Blvd. It&#039;s much bigger, so dogs have more room to run, and there are often kiddie pools set up in the summer- my pup loves it. The other advantage is that there always seem to be other dogs there- I&#039;ve found 69th to be a bit hit or miss as to whether there&#039;s anyone else for my dog to play with.<br />

				Thanks everyone for the replies all very helpful. He now has all his vaccinations so he&#039;ll be joining you all at the dog run and the park on Queens blvd in the near future.

				Hi!<br />I&#039;m assuming &quot;wackybrit&quot; is Django&#039;s owner? This is Jea&#039;s mom- we live in the same building :) Our dog sitter is going on vacation next month and we need to find someone to fill in for a while- who do you use? (I remember you mentioning you found someone...)<br />Thanks!<br />-Sarah
