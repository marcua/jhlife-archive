					i know its kinda far from JH but Crocheron Park in Bayside is my FAV. park in queens. Its a moderate walk from the LIRR and im not sure how to get there by bus b/c I always drive there. But the drive/LIRR ride is well worth the exrta time to get there. <br /><br />It has LOTSSSSS of green space, 4 ball fields, a little under 10 tennis courts, a waterpark during the summer for children, and a basketball court. It also offeres many nice walking paths and they even have 2 gazibos (did i spell that wrong? lol)....for the tennis courts they are *free* during the year untill about may through the end of auguest. Comes the end of may you have to pay either for the whole summer or per day...and btw these courts have the CHEAPEST rates in queens when it comes to paying for court time, trust me I did my research lol*<br /><br />***It is a very well maintained park and right outside the tennis courts are VERY CLEAN and well taken care of public restrooms. The side of the park that is directly across from peoples nice homes, are where the courts and fields are and is the side that has a hugeeee parking. The other side along the grassy/meadow-ish part of the park, is a dead end street that if you take the street all the way down, theres a huge pond with benches and also you walk up the huge staircase and there is a bridge that is built over the cross island parkway and takes you over to the other side which is a water front view with a paved sidewalk and a section for bike riders and roller bladers. <br /><br />Sometimes I forget im in queens lol<br /><br /><br />Anyway just thought id put in my 2cents

					thought I would bring this post back to life<br /><br />i just joined the site and ive lived in jackson heights for all 22 yrs of my life lol Im in the upper 70&#039;s and my best friend lives in the mid 80&#039;s. Age is just a number to me really, buyt you dont seem to find too many ppl around my neighborhood (upper 70&#039;s around 37th ave) that are my age. Then again over 3/4 of my friends are all 25+ and the few people that are my age I grew up with. I went to high school in manhattan (performing arts hs) where everyone came from all 5 boroughs, so nobody was ever really close to me. Then for college I went up to Connecticut for 3 years and when I got back from school I went back to not knowing many ppl and always driving to my friends house either in long island or jersey. <br /><br />so im glad i foudn this message board..now I see that JH is not as boring of a neighborhood that i thought it was lol

					<br />Hello, I am a 22 yr old female college student graduating in a year. I absolutely love children and have well over 9 years of experience in caring for children of all ages- infants up to teenagers. <br /><br /><br />I am located here in Jackson Heights up the block from 37th ave in the high 70&#039;s. I have a valid drivers license with a clean record, so traveling to any other part of queens is not a problem. <br /><br /><br />To describe me in a few words, I am a very fun, reliable, energetic and responsible individual. I am a non-smoker as well. I would love to bring your child/children to the park, take them to activities, help them with school work if they need it, and anything else you would suggest. <br /><br /><br />As of now im mainly looking for part-time hours but this semester at school is over 2nd week of December. I can work throughout the year- due to my schedule being very FLEXIBLE and I can work days, nights, and even weekends if need be. <br /><br /><br /><br />I have a GREAT resume with checkable references that I will be glad to send you if necessary. I will only send the resume to those who contact me.<br /><br /><br />Please feel free to contact me with any questions/concerns you may have. Just send me a private message on this site or reply to this msg with contact info and I will get back to you ASAP. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks! <br /><br />

					Hello, i just joined this site and and i dont think i could have picked a better topic to make my 1st post on.<br /><br />Forest Hills Pediatric is AMAZING. My pediatrician was from that office and I saw him from birth up untill I was 13/14ish I believe. There have been since then a handfull of new doctors there, but there are still 3-4 doctors that STILL work there that I used to see when I went there. Even the hopstials that the doctors have their main affiliations with (they give great referals if you need to see a Doctor in a specific field of medicine), are mostly (if not all) top notch hosptials in NY State.<br /><br /><br />When it comes to the transportation issue, whoever made the comment about taking an infant on the subway is completly right. Comming from Jackson Heights by subway is so easy, but I would wait untill the child is a bit older. Taking a cab from JH to Forest Hillls Pediatric is about a 15 min. ride, give or take 5-10 min for traffic depending on the time of day. I have a great cab service # that picks you up from your residence 5-10 min after you call them to pick you up. Since Forest Hills is so close of a ride, their rates are great aswell! If anyone would like that number I would be more then happy to share it with you guys.<br /><br /><br />I also want to share a quick story that I found amusing. About a year ago when I was working for a family in Forest Hills as the babysitter/caretaker for their 5-month old infant, when I first started with the family I had recieved all the contact information for their childs pediatrician. She had told me that the childs main pediatrician was a few blocks away and is an amazing doctor named Dr. Joseph Soloway. I could help but laugh out loud, and I told her that he was my main doctor from the age of birth up untill i was 14 years old. I am now 22 yrs old and I couldnt believe that he was still one of the head pediatricians at that office.<br /><br /><br />ANYWAY, I appologize for going on a rant in this reply, but I just cant express how amazing this Office is. Whenever I start a family I will most def. take my children there.<br /><br /><br />thanks for sticking through this long reply! hope this information helped!
