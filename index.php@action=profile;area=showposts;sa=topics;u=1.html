					Hi all,<br /><br />First of all I&#039;m so sorry the site has been down the last couple days. It seems there was a major outage of the server and the company that hosts this site had a very difficult time trying to get it back online. Perhaps it affected more than just our server. Regardless, I&#039;ve decided to migrate the site to a new server and host.<br /><br />Please let the moderators know if you see anything strange in the coming days. Unfortunately I was forced to restore from a backup that was generated on 9/1/16, so a few posts are likely missing.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />merm

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />In the process of working on the server this afternoon (was trying to work on removing some of the spam accounts that have registered in the last few months) legitimate user accounts were deleted, and posts lost. That means I needed to restore a backup of the database from earlier this afternoon (around 4pm). This means that posts that were made between 4pm and 9pm were unfortunately lost. <img src="Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> But at least the legitimate users are back on the site.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to work on figuring out how to both deal with the problem of fake spam registrations, and also not removing legitimate users. In the meantime I&#039;m sorry if you were one of the people who posted this afternoon and now your post is missing.<br /><br />Wishing you all well.

					Greetings,<br /><br />The site appears to have been hacked yesterday and this morning I believe I&#039;ve fixed the problem by restoring some files form earlier versions. You may still continue to get notices from Google that the site as &quot;malicious&quot; code because it will take them a while to update their records. I&#039;ve submitted a request to have them review the site again. At this point I don&#039;t believe the database itself was compromised, I don&#039;t believe usernames or passwords were stolen, however it&#039;s always a good time to <a href="index.php@action=profile%3Bu=1%3Bsa=account.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">change passwords</a> so you may want to consider doing that.

					Greetings!<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy to announce that Chuckster has accepted the moderators invitation to become a global moderator of the forum. Chuckster will be assuming the new role for a term of 6 months. She joins the moderator team to replace Toddg, who is stepping down to assume the role of full time calendar editor. I know I speak on behalf of everyone when I say a huge thanks to Todd for all his work in getting this site off the ground and in welcoming Chuckster to the moderator team.<br /><br />As the site continues to grow, more moderator positions may become available, and it&#039;s our goal to assign new positions as they are needed on a 6-month rotating term.<br /><br />Our current moderators are:<br />Shelby2 - Moderator<br />Chuckster - Moderator<br />Toddg - Calendar Editor<br />merm - Site Admin<br /><br />Thank you all for your continued support of the site.

Given the nature of this online community having real world connections to a real community (Jackson Heights and nearby neighborhoods) it&#039;s important to keep in mind that what happens here is not limited to the void of the internet. What you say, and how you behave here has an impact on (and will be read by) your neighbors. Please treat others with the same respect you would like to receive in return. This isn&#039;t just a random internet site with people you&#039;ll never meet.<br /><br /><strong>This is not a &quot;bulletin board&quot;</strong> like the kind you see at your local grocery store, it is a community discussion and conversation board. There is a bias on the board towards &quot;discussion&quot; and less interest in &quot;classifieds&quot; and &quot;advertisements&quot;. If you have a classified or advertisement to post it&#039;s no problem, just please do it in the business or trade categories, or post on <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Use of this site, and participation in discussions here are a privilege not a right.</strong> This is a private website, not a governmental agency or publicly owned service.

Instead engage the person&#039;s idea and express your disagreement with it in a respectful way (I disagree with what you&#039;ve said here and this is why...). </li><li><strong>Don&#039;t rush to judgment</strong>:&nbsp; Please keep in mind that things don&#039;t always come across in writing the same as they sound in their author&#039;s head.&nbsp; This is a common problem on the Internet, where people don&#039;t always carefully compose what they write, and readers can&#039;t benefit from the visual and aural cues that help listeners understand a speaker&#039;s real meaning when they talk face to face.&nbsp; So before taking offense at something you read here, please consider whether there&#039;s an alternative way to interpret the author&#039;s intent.</li><li><strong>Use the &quot;report to moderator&quot; feature</strong>: If you find something offensive, or if someone is misbehaving or not following the board guidelines please assist the moderators by reporting that post. A message is generated that goes to the moderation queue and moderators will respond as soon as possible.</li><li><strong>This is an open forum</strong>:&nbsp; The owners or administrators of this board cannot and do not read every post, and cannot back up or investigate all the information that is posted here. Please understand that any posts that you read here do not necessarily represent the ideas of the owners or administrators of this board. </li><li><strong>Protect your privacy</strong>.&nbsp; This website is accessible to all, so we recommend limiting the amount of personal information you post here.&nbsp; You can &quot;hide&quot; your email address from others seeing it.&nbsp; But don&#039;t be alarmed that the software will still show you <em>your own email address</em>. Don&#039;t worry, if the hide email setting is turned on, nobody else can see your address.</li><li><strong>DON&#039;T SHOUT!</strong>&nbsp; Try not to emphasize your point using all capital letters.&nbsp; Many readers consider it jarring, sort of like shouting in a library.</li><li><strong>Keep signatures simple</strong>: You may create a personal &quot;signature&quot; to use in all your postings. However, signatures are limited to text only.&nbsp; No banners or other graphics allowed.&nbsp; Links to internet businesses without a connection to this community may result in your account being marked as a spam account and deleted.</li><li><strong>You&#039;re not completely anonymous</strong>: Our software tracks your IP address, and keeps a log of your actions on this board (though this software doesn&#039;t go beyond the scope of any other forum software out there). If a formal legal complaint is filed as a result of some action you&#039;ve taken on this board we reserve the right to share this information with legal council or authorities.</li><li><strong>Don&#039;t abuse the cover of anonymity</strong> to advance commercial/professional interests in a deceptive manner (e.g. posing as a customer of your restaurant, or posing as a concerned citizen if you&#039;re a political professional).&nbsp; We reserve the right to disclose relevant information about this type of abuse to the community.</li><li><strong>You&#039;re responsible for your posts</strong>: If you give out your password and someone else logs into your account, you are still responsible for what is posted. Don&#039;t give out your password.</li><li><strong>Cookies</strong>: This software places a cookie on your computer that is used to store your username/password (if you have that feature enabled), and is also used for some of the more advanced features of the site. If you prefer to not have those features enabled you can simply block our cookie. </li><li><strong>Deleting posts</strong>: Once you have created an account and/or posted here, you will not be able to delete those posts or your account. Contact a moderator if you have questions or need assistance.</li><li><strong>Classified boards (Apartments, Sublets &amp; Roommates; Community Trade and Classifieds; and Business Listings and Services Directory)</strong>: These sections are for posting classified and local business listings and are not discussion forums.&nbsp; &nbsp;Simple questions can be asked in the Classified boards, but please limit commentary and discussion to the appropriate board under &quot;Get Connected.&quot;<br /><br /><br /></li></ul><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></span><br /><br />By registering here you agree that:<br /><br />(1) You will not post any abusive, vulgar, or offensive information on this forum;<br /><br />(2) You will respect the privacy of others, and not reveal the identity of, or post the private contact information of, or otherwise harass others in a way that invades their right to remain anonymous;<br /><br />(3) You will abide by applicable U.S. and International law as it relates to any of your posts this forum; and <br /><br />(4) You are soley responsible for the content you post and recognize that your views (and the views of others) do not necessarily represent the views of the board owners, administrators or moderators.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Please provide feedback about these guidelines.
