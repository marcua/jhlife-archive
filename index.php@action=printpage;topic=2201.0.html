				This place is scary good!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there about four times and have never been disappointed. It is French/Mexican.&nbsp; Decor is more East Village than JH.&nbsp; Try the chicken quesadillas and the chocolate brioche - or anything else on the menu.&nbsp; Wonderful and right at the #7 stop (get off on the east end of the platform).

				Did you happen to notice if there were vegetarian options on the menu?&nbsp; French/mexican--that sounds really interesting.

				I know there were many salads and soups that would appeal to vegetarians (or so I would think).&nbsp; Will try to go again soon.&nbsp; A very eclectic clientele too (and good music - not too loud!)

				Funny, I was just there today for lunch.&nbsp; I agree... the food is to die for!<br /><br />As for vegetarian options, there are a few.&nbsp; Veggie tacos and some vegetarian sandwiches.&nbsp; Also pizzas I think.&nbsp; It is worth checking out if you are vegetarian.&nbsp; They also serve delicious brunch.

				Yeah, Victor&#039;s great. Kate generally has the vegetable quesadillas or a pizza if she&#039;s eating vegetarian. But the seafood is generally fantastic as are any of the beef dishes. We keep asking him to move to JH!
