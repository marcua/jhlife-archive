				I just went to the movie theatre on 82nd for the first time last week. Woahhh. Does anyone have any interesting information on this? <br /><br />I am so intrigued. That room is tremendous. I imagine it has a lot of history to it. Also, I can see so much potential to it. The only bad part is the quality of the projector is pretty bad. <br /><br />what do you think?

				That theater is such an amazing space, and really one of the treasures of the neighborhood.&nbsp; I would LOVE to see it fully restored.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about its history, but I wanted to say that not only is it an gorgeous space, but it also has managers who are very responsive to the community&#039;s needs.&nbsp; A few years back, we brought about 200 adult ESOL students to a free screening of Maria Full of Grace there, and the space and time of the theater staff were donated by the theater.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				The theater is beautiful. &nbsp;For those long time residents the Boulevard Theater on Northern boulevard between 82-83 was also very grand. &nbsp;it is a shame that it is now Natives, Bingo etc. I am copying a description of the Jackson from a great web site called cinema treasures. &nbsp;I will also post the link to that site.<br /><br />Also known as Jackson Theatre<br />&nbsp;Jackson Heights, Queens, NY <br />40-31 82nd Street, Jackson Heights, Queens, NY, United States(map)<br />Status: Open <br />Screens: Triplex <br />Style: Unknown <br />&nbsp;Function: Movies <br />Seats: 1500 <br />Chain: Unknown <br />&nbsp;Architect: Herbert J. Krapp <br />Firm: Unknown <br />&nbsp;<br />The Jackson is an old vaudeville era theater that has held on to this day as a movie house. The balcony has been halved to allow for two small upstairs theaters that are pretty lousy. However, the main auditorium, with around 1,000 seats, its original stylings intact, and Dolby digital stereo, is arguably the best &quot;Cinema Treasure&quot; theater still operating in Queens. &nbsp;<br /><br />http://cinematreasures.org<br /><br /><br />

				The theater on 82nd Street was called The Colony Theater. It was a small one but very comfortable.<br /><br />Both the Jackson and the Boulevard Theaters were magnificent. The Blvd was <em>off-off-off<em> broadway.</em></em> <br /><br />I remember when I was very young seeing special live programs for children along with kid movies and cartoons. It was lots of fun. I &#039;graduated&#039; from 6th grade at that theater. There was a large stage, with wings which included dressing rooms, backstage areas and the sort. This is now Natives Theater. Schools rent the facilities for shows -I know The Renaissance has rented it in the past.<br /><br />Years ago, there was a movement to have the Blvd Theater landmarked as a remembrance of the live Vaudeville shows from the past. It wasn&#039;t successful as we can tell. It was beautiful.<br /><br />Does anyone know the history of the Jackson?

				Ah the Jackson Theater. I used to go there all the time. Back when it was a single screen theater I remember the left hand side was a kids only section and they used to have matronly women shushing the kids and scolding them. <br /><br />I remember seeing Earthquake and Rollercoaster in Sensurround at the Jackson. I think the last time I was in there was for the film The Hitcher and it was split into three screens.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read somewhere that they play the films in English with Spanish subtitles these days?

				I remember the matron at the Jackson. Boy was she tough to us kids. Yep, you had to sit on the side until you were 16 or were with someone 16 or older. Once, my brother pretended to be 16 so we could sit in the middle. He even had me practice telling the matron that he was really 16. <br /><br />That memory brought back a smile.&nbsp; ::)<br />Thanks for taking me down memory lane!

				I also saw WallE last weekend. not only were there subtitles, but some of the scenes where something was written in english now had the things written in spanish. like complete reanimation to spell something in spanish. <br />pretty weird. <br /><br />theres not much dialogue in wallE - so for the first 20 minutes or so we were wondering &#039;is this in spanish???&#039;<br /><br />this is such a treasure. i wish they could make the screen brighter. cant we get some govt funds to improve it?

				<br /><br />&nbsp;I have very fond memories of the Jackson in the 50&#039;s. An enormous hall with the well remembered children&#039;s section and the stern matrons with flashlights to find children who had sneaked into the adult seats. A big candy counter and stairways leading up to the high balconies. Yet it wasn&#039;t the grand style of the Jackson and the Boulevard theatres but rather the lowly Earle and Colony theatres that are the one&#039;s I remember best. The Earle used to have colored flyers that kids would collect for a free or discount admission to the Saturday show. It was as always a cartoon, a serial(the last one I saw was Dick Tracey versus the Claw or was it Crime Inc. ?)then followed by a kid friendly double bill of a cowboy film or science fiction film and maybe Francis the talking mule or Ma and Pa Kettle. <br />I mentioned in another posting the wonderul interior of the Earle. All dark green and crystal. I went back to visit it some few years ago when it became the Eagle(why on earth change the name?) and the Indian management kindly allowed me to have a look round although clearly dumbfounded that anyone would be interested. The interior had been gutted-nothing remained of it. Even the subdued lighting that I remember was replaced by bright lights. So what remains of the Earle is the E that starts the Eagle which if I am right is the&nbsp; only hint of what was before the Eagle had landed.

				I saw Wall E at this theater as well and was really disappointed by the theater.&nbsp; I could hear the sound from the theater next door in the background throughout the film, I tried three different isles before I found a seat that wasn&#039;t broken and it was hot.&nbsp; Actually, there&#039;s a sign in the lobby near the ticket taker that says something to the affect of &quot;its as cool in here as its going to get, so don&#039;t bother asking&quot;.&nbsp; I would a theater in the neighborhood that shows first run films.&nbsp; I would also like it if there were a few indy films like Frozen River in the mix.&nbsp; And I&#039;m not saying that they shouldn&#039;t be subtitled in Spanish, that&#039;s fine by me but I&#039;d like the theater to be in better shape and have a broader selection of films.

				I&#039;ve had great memories of Jackson Theater.&nbsp; I remember back when I was in Junior High (IS145) some friends and I would go there all the time.&nbsp; It cost $3.00 at the time and we were able to see all the showings.&nbsp; Im not sure how it is now being that its been an extremely long time that I visited Jackson Theater.&nbsp; However, the exterior still looks the same and they seem to be busy.<br /><br />Like most mom and pop establishments corporate America has taken over.&nbsp; Everything form book, hardware, candy stores have been effected by major chain retailers (Barnes &amp; Noble, Home Depot, Multi/Mega Plex Theathers). I am happy that Jackson Theater still have it&#039;s loyal movie goers.&nbsp; I do admit (from my last J. Theather experience) that the film quality may not be up to par but it has tradition.

				Where&#039;s aronan? if this isn&#039;t a kick in the butt to start things, I don&#039;t know what is. This theater is one of the most beautiful I&#039;ve ever seen and it would be a tremendous shame if anything were to happen to it. There is definitely a need for a movie house around here, we have the culture to surround it. the market is coming back, it&#039;s time to stand up.

				I like Jeff&#039;s post. So true.<br /><br />It seems like such a unique opportunity that not one -but two- historic movie theaters are avail in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder if we could contact any local institutions that might have the infrastructure in place suited for taking something like that over (i.e. Queens Museum of Art, Queens Council on the Arts, Museum of the Moving Image, MoMA as a satellite branch).&nbsp; Problem is, that these institutions are struggling at times like these and are cutting back rather than expanding.&nbsp; <br />

				There&#039;s a series of photos of historic theaters on the Bridge and Tunnel website &nbsp;(http://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/citywide/theaters/index.htm). &nbsp;Many appear to be no longer operating as theaters. &nbsp;I guess this situation is not unusual. &nbsp;<br /><br />I noticed when I walked up Roosevelt one day into Corona that there is a historic theater there that now has a Walgreens in front. &nbsp;Perhaps it&#039;s already been discussed somewhere on this site, but I hadn&#039;t known about it and was surprised to see it.

				I have many fond memories at Jackson Triplex.&nbsp; Sure it was rundown and poorly kept, but it&#039;s a staple in Jackson Heights history. For one, it inspired my career as filmmaker. I always dreamed of screening one of my films at this movie house, I was suppose to this year with the Food and Film Festival. <br /><br />I won&#039;t allow them to take that dream away from me. I&#039;m willing to create a petition or reach out to the city council.&nbsp; There has to be a way to landmark this theater. We&#039;re right around the corner from the elections.

				Falling victim to a similar fate, Flushing&#039;s RKO Keith garnered some attention as a result of a Facebook Group page called <strong>Save The RKO Keith&#039;s Flushing</strong>. &nbsp;The page was started by a group of people interested in saving the theater. &nbsp;Not having read all the posts though, I&#039;m not sure how effective the group has been in deterring a complete demolition of the theater. &nbsp;I&#039;ll take a look and read through some of the posts. &nbsp;Maybe a few of them may contain some useful information.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link if anyone else is interested in doing some reading:<br /><br />Save The RKO Keith&#039;s Flushing / Facebook Group Page (http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=RKO+Keith&amp;init=quick#/group.php?gid=60984938277&amp;v=wall&amp;ref=search)<br /><br />Also, a while back, I had created a thread about the RKO. &nbsp;At that time, the theater&#039;s Facebook group page had gotten some attention.<br /><br />Flushing&#039;s RKO Keith Theater (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2433.0)<br />

				We can just give up. I know there was a movement to get the Boulevard Theater an historic classification but it didn&#039;t work. However, that was many years ago and there were more old-time theaters. <br /><br />From the look of the Jackson from the other site, it was also probably a theater that house vaudeville and off-off broadway shows. There are many residents who are in the &quot;biz&quot; many someone who knows someone can get some help to preserve theater history. Anyone have any history on who performed at the Jackson. A special event or person could give up an edge at preservation.<br /><br />Any ideas?

				That idea won&#039;t work. Never had any shows - no stage.<br /><br /><strong>Jackson Theatre <br /><br />40-31 82nd Street <br />Jackson Heights (Queens), N.Y. 11373</strong><br /><br />The 1500-seat Jackson Theatre, designed by Herbert J. Krapp, opened in the 1920s with movies only. It had no stage facilities and never presented vaudeville, though during silent days it had a resident orchestra that accompanied the movies. The Jackson was originally built and operated by Grob &amp; Knobel, a small circuit also responsible for the Boulevard Theatre in Jackson Heights and the Sunnyside Theatre (both also designed by Herbert J. Krapp). In 1928, Grob &amp; Knobel sold all three theatres to William Fox, who lost them in bankruptcy in 1930. In a liquidation of the Fox properties, the Jackson and Boulevard were taken over by Skouras Theatres and the Sunnyside by Century. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />There appears to have been a Wurlitzer Organ that was special. I wonder if it is still there.<br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.nycago.org/Organs/Qns/html/JacksonTheatre.html<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

				I have just emailed the JHBG to help us with maintaining a movie theater in the community. I believe this is part of their mission also. I think I will also contact Jose Peralta. Now that he is running for the Senate, he will want to be very responsive to JH (not that he ignored us before).<br /><br />Who else will do something??

				<strong>from the email sent</strong><br /><br /><em>Jose and Yonell,<br />&nbsp;<br />It has become reality that JH no longer has an entertainment venue. The last movie theater (The Jackson) has now closed. It is important for a thriving community to have something special like that to keep residents here and shopping and dinning in the area. It will bring in business to the area. <br />&nbsp;<br />Please help us make connections with some either chain or independent movie theaters to try to re-establish a venue before the Jackson is torn down.

				A small group of us (some from JHL and some not) have been doing a little research in to the property on 82nd St. As far as the Jackson is concerned, there is interest among theater operators to lease or possibly purchase the space. I can tell you it isn&#039;t cheap. <br /><br />Outreach to press etc. won&#039;t be much help if there isn&#039;t an organized group with the money to assume control of one of these spaces. Contacting electeds and getting them involved won&#039;t do much to help in the short term. We can all agree that money coming from the city or the state takes a long time to come if it comes at all. <br /><br />We also have to consider that this is ultimately a Real Estate deal, and as such the more attention generated surrounding either one of the two spaces the higher the price of the property will go. <br /><br />I hate to sound like a Nay sayer, and believe me if I had multiple millions of dollars to buy one of the spaces I would. &nbsp;But it seems the best bet at the moment is to wait and see who wins out in the bidding process and work with them to create a space that we will all find useful and enjoyable. <br /><br />Of course if any one out there has several million they aren&#039;t doing anything with, please feel free to let us know :) &nbsp;

				Does anybody know how exactly the Jackson closed?<br /><br />I&#039;m originally from this area but have been living and working the past 20 years out in Long Island.&nbsp; I always found myself going back to the Jackson to watch the latest movies.&nbsp; The movies always seemed more special and magical in that building than the multiplexes out here.<br /><br />I was in the Jackson on Sunday October 18th, 2009 and assume this was their last day of operation.&nbsp; The theater&#039;s telephone schedule never changed from that weekend timetable.&nbsp; The staff must not have been allowed back in on the following Monday.<br /><br />Even though I live out here, I still have many emotional ties to your community and would like to include myself in any effort to help save the theater.&nbsp; The Jackson was an integral part of my life growing up in the Jackson Heights community and if possible I would like to help.

				Yahoo Movies shows listings at the theater for tomorrow, May 20!<br />http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes-tickets/theaters/3022-jackson-heights-cinema/<br /><br />The first films are two Bollywood films, Housefull (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housefull_(2010_film)) and Kites (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kites_(film)).<br /><br />With three screens to fill, I imagine the re-opening of this theater creates opportunities for the cultural and arts partnerships we were all dreaming about last year. &nbsp;Anybody have any thoughts of how to get started?<br /><br /><br />Update: Kites had a splashy premiere in Manhattan and London yesterday (http://satyamshot.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/the-kites-ny-premiere/).

				I received a phone call last night from a friend in Jackson Heights, she told me that the Triplex was open, under new management and a lease renewal. I immediately made my way to the theater to greet the owners. Upon arriving I noticed a camera crew interviewing the new owner of the theater, a middle aged Indian man. I approached one of them and expressed my appreciation for their vested interest in trying to restore the theater. He said it was an arduous undertaking, but they renewed the lease for five more years and they are working on making it a landmark.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Reparations and renovations are already underway, (they&#039;ve added carpeting and painted the walls in the lobby) and the theater will have it&#039;s &quot;official opening&quot; this Saturday. I thought this would be of interest to everyone on the forum.<br /><br />On another note, I am working in conjunction with owner&#039;s son to premiere my film at the theater, we are planning on having a red carpet screening (he&#039;s even willing to close the theater down just for this event). It would be great to have support from the community for this, as it is probably the first time something like this is attempted at the theater. We are thinking June 18.<br /><br />This has been a childhood dream of mine and now its come true. I get a second chance at screening my first feature film in the theater that cultivated my love for film in the first place.<br /><br />The name of the film is &#039;The Electro Wars&#039;<br />You can find more information on it here: www.theelectrowars.com (http://www.theelectrowars.com)<br /><br />http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/04/26/the-electro-wars/ (http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/04/26/the-electro-wars/)<br />http://www.yrbmagazine.com/blog/post/3266/the-electro-wars-a-documentary (http://www.yrbmagazine.com/blog/post/3266/the-electro-wars-a-documentary)<br />http://www.complex.com/blogs/2010/03/17/wake-n-watch-the-electro-wars-documentary-trailer/ (http://www.complex.com/blogs/2010/03/17/wake-n-watch-the-electro-wars-documentary-trailer/)<br />http://www.brutblog.com/wordpress/2010/05/the-electro-wars-european-premiere-at-rialto-amsterdam-the-22th-of-may/comment-page-1/<br />&nbsp;(http://www.brutblog.com/wordpress/2010/05/the-electro-wars-european-premiere-at-rialto-amsterdam-the-22th-of-may/comment-page-1/)<br /><br />I grew up in Jackson Heights my whole life, I am now 26 years old, and I am still very fond of the neighborhood. The subject matter in the film appeals to a younger demographic, and it has the support from many of them in the community, it would be a great event to bring publicity to the theater, give it a second life. I am actually screening a preview of the film in Amsterdam tomorrow and then in Vegas next week, but there has not been a NYC screening as of yet. <br /><br /><br />
