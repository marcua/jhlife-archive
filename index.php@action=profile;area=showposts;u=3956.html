					I became involved in this discussion about a month ago when it seemed Garden school was taking slings and arrows from the community, and good people like Dr. Marotta were having to endure unfounded personal attacks.&nbsp; At this point I feel and I hope others here can agree that the topic has moved into more issue-oriented territory.&nbsp; There is less outrage from all sides and importantly, as I am a Garden parent, I think the community has read enough contributions from bloggers that show the school is really on the same page as the groups and individuals outside the school, that a greenspace/park would be ideal for all, but also that the immediate future of the school makes the issue more pragmatic than ideological from the Garden side.&nbsp; In sum, more good ideas have been pushed to the center of the table of late.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope that it adds up to good things for the school and the community. ... And by the way -- Taggie has been a very positive and informed voice on this topic, which has been most helpful.&nbsp; And, since someone asked, ... yes, I DO think T. is in fact the voice of Garden, sort of a Kissinger-style Foggy Bottom shadow government.&nbsp; Don&#039;t you?

					It benefits all discussion of the issue to get more information out about the particulars of the review process and other non-subjective points.&nbsp; Snarky quips and high school insults only waste time.&nbsp; Taking up torches and lanterns against Garden does a disservice to all who would like to see this issue resolved to the benefit of the community and the school.&nbsp; If the city really is offering nearly two million dollars more than previously reported, at a time when its budget is being put to the sword, is &quot;stunned surprise&quot; enough to describe such a turnaround?&nbsp; I think the term &quot;show me the money&quot; comes into play here.&nbsp; Nearly a million and a half more than the reported asking price -- why would a financially stressed city do that?&nbsp; It would be a beautiful resolution, heretofore unthinkable in scope.&nbsp; I would hope all parties would sign on as soon as a contract was put on the table.&nbsp; But as a taxpayer, ... man, I have to hear Bloomberg crying all the time about the unfortunate sacrifices all of us in the city have to make during these difficult times, and we have seen the cuts in services everywhere the working New Yorker goes and the threats and embroglios with teachers, cops, sanitation workers, pension haggling -- how is this $6.8 figure possible, and why?&nbsp; From the Daily News&#039; lips to god&#039;s ears.&nbsp; But you gotta wonder.

					The NY1 story was the fair and balanced coverage that this issue has needed.&nbsp; Of course it would be great to do the city/greenspace thing; Garden admits as much and its kids helped run the Play Street last year.&nbsp; As the reporter points out and quotes Michael Rakosi, the city cannot meet the asking price and just because it budgets funds for such a project it doesn&#039;t mean that it will get a go-ahead in a year or two when the money is supposed to become available.&nbsp; And just because an item is in the budget it is not guaranteed funding.&nbsp; Financing the school&#039;s debt to accommodate that is itself is a huge debt burden.&nbsp; There are a lot of promises, but perhaps Garden doesn&#039;t want to put the very existence of the school on money that may or may not appear, and at some point in the future.&nbsp; Anyone interested enough in this story to be reading this should watch the NY1 piece at: <a href="http://www.ny1.com/?ArID=133573" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.ny1.com/?ArID=133573</a>.

					The Ramos story could be seen as necessary background providing<em></em> a fuller discussion of the issue, as it is germane to know as much as we can about all parties involved in the Garden property sale.&nbsp; The catch lies in the line that says Ms Ramos is afraid the school (Garden) will meet the same fate (closing) if, and I paraphrase, &quot;they sell the yard to a real estate developer.&quot;&nbsp; It simply doesn&#039;t matter to whom the school sells the property.&nbsp; Money is money.&nbsp; It could sink or swim with five million from the city as well as five million from a developer.&nbsp; I am a parent of a Garden student and Dr. Marotta&#039;s history is certainly no secret at school.&nbsp; He has never evaded a question about anything like that, and speaks frankly and openly regarding any personal professional question.&nbsp; The situation to which the article refers was, like the one today at Garden, much more of an institutional dysfunction and to simply hang the entire affair on Dr. Marotta is misguided, at least.&nbsp; Dr. Marotta is one member of an administration in whose hands Garden&#039;s affairs are placed.&nbsp; He is an outstanding Headmaster and very much wants the best for his students and the greater Garden community in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I feel that the mention of the <em>Times</em> article was pitched to misinform and influence the discussion unfairly.
