				Returned after a month away.&nbsp; My god, JH is disgusting. What happened? <br />-Drunks seem to be everywhere, they are permanent fixtures around those new LINk NY kiosks <br />-Fuck covid&nbsp; shark graffiti everywhere. <br />-Homeless encampments at the post office. <br />-Streets are repulsive with garbage and waste. <br />I would be embarrassed to have someone visit me here.&nbsp; <br /><br />How does this happen?&nbsp; Do are elected officials do anything?&nbsp; Or do they just care of national politics?

				Hi I was walking on 82nd street to the train the other day and the sidewalk was trashed! I’ve never seen it that bad. It was littered with paper, torn up lotto tickets, plastic bags and more. That was after I passed the 3 homeless men that sleep by RiteAid. Such a depressing way to start the day....<br />Maybe the increase of street venders is the cause?

				lotto tickets, cigarette butts and plastic bags don&#039;t come from street vendors. and you can&#039;t blame street vendors for homelessness, either. <br /><br />as Lalochezia says, this is just the beginning of a Depression, not a recovery from a &quot;recession.&quot; and it&#039;s worse in smaller/mid-size towns in states where the economy is even worse. we do need to buckle up.

				Using the economy is a weak excuse.&nbsp; I shouldn’t have to buckle up and expect a trashed neighborhood.&nbsp; A large part of our high taxes goes to police and municipals.&nbsp; We should expect clean and safe streets.&nbsp; If we don’t have them, then we don’t have proper leadership advocating for them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nothing has changed in funding.&nbsp; Our taxes remain the same. <br /><br />I have been to a few neighborhoods in Long Island and upstate NY this past month.&nbsp; The economy sucks there as well.&nbsp; But all of them have been clean and well maintained.&nbsp; Very unlike here

				&nbsp;It would be great if once or twice a week, people picked up some trash. David Sedaris has done this in the English countryside where he was upset at the litter he found. It can be therapeutic which might sound crazy to some but it&#039;s also being part of the solution. Use&nbsp; gloves of course, and maybe a pair of tongs if you have some or one of those grabbers if you own that tool. Maybe bring along some water for the street trees and the median also.<br />&nbsp; Happy picking!

				82nd BID pays for cleaners to keep 82nd St clean. Hard to pay for this when your business has been closed.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a thought. If you feel there&#039;s a lack of leadership, become a leader. Organize like-minded people to clean the streets, like JHBG does from time to time.

Especially since the day I left a drunk guy, right in the middle of 82nd street, stood up, unzipped his fly, pulled out his junk, and peed in the middle of the block. I am a life long new Yorker and I have never seen anything like that. My god, go turn to the corner at least.<br /><br />Either way, I&#039;ve been upstate as well and I wholeheartedly agree that these are some depressed communities as well and they are CLEAN. Not even a shred of paper on the ground. We can all do better. Hell, even the Renaissance Charter School absolutely TRASHES the corner of 82nd Street. I&#039;ve made numerous complaints to elected officials that go unanswered.<br /><br />If anyone is up for organizing litter pickup days, I would join you.

				&nbsp;<strong>There is a cleanup organized to continue the cleaning of the litter on 69th Street.</strong> <br />Sanitation has been working there but more can be done. Meet on 69th Street this Saturday @9:00am and bring gloves and water. Nuala has organized this in response to so many people expressing concern about the trash.

				It seems like the complaint here is that our local leaders haven&#039;t planted a money tree grove in Travers Park to fund sanitation and homeless services in the neighborhood. Someone should get on top of that to fix the budget shortfall that inconvenient global pandemic caused.

				The complaint here is we have 100k tax paying citizens here in JH.&nbsp; A large part of that tax revenue goes to homeless services.&nbsp; So where is it?&nbsp; Show me the money!&nbsp; Or if you can’t then&nbsp; get me a local leader that can advocate for local tax money to be used in the community.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of us have paid plenty in taxes to address this

				The entire situation seems to be getting worse since the first post was made, and we can add a noticeable spike in crime as well. Our local officials are basically useless. Danny Dromm will at least respond and then do nothing, but if you are unfortunate enough to live in Moya&#039;s district, good luck to you. He can&#039;t be bothered unless it involves some sort of feel good photo op.
