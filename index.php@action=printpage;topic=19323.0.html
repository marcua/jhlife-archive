				A 3 year old male cat was abandoned by his owners.&nbsp; He was left outside the house on 70 Street and Broadway.&nbsp; Someone took him to Animal Care and Control&nbsp; He is currently there and up for adoption although his chances are not good.&nbsp; His ID# 74688 his temporary name is BROADWAY.&nbsp; He is in the Manhattan facility which is better than the Brooklyn one and easier to get to.&nbsp; Please spread the word.&nbsp; I think he deserves a new home.&nbsp; He is white with a little gray cap.&nbsp; He appears to be a smallish cat for a male.<br />Thanks

				Update: apparently this kitty was being kicked by various people after being abandoned by his owner. So far ACC has determined there is no long term damage. He is okayed for neutering and will have a more in depth personality assessment soon. He was treated for ear mites. I don’t know if he’s been tested yet. The longer he’s there the possibility for sickness greatly increases.&nbsp; Please ask around. He’s a Jackson heights “resident”<br />Thank you

				Here&#039;s a link for the little guy. Will refrain from my thoughts on the asshole who dumped him and the sick bastards who kicked him. I can help get him neutered for free if there are any takers. https://www.nycacc.org/adopt/broadway-74688

				Saturday, Sept. 14th, Animal Care is conducting an adoption day (noon to 4pm) at PETCO in Jackson Heights Shopping Center. This cat should be among the available adoptees. Wouldn&#039;t it be nice were he to be adopted in his hometown! <br /><br />His name is Broadway, ID#74688. https://www.nycacc.org/adopt/broadway-74688<br />

				Maybe if a lot of people inquired about him and requested ACC include him in the event they would bring him. Worth a try!
