				A gray and white cat showed up at our window last night on 34th ave &amp; 80th St.&nbsp; We&#039;ve never seen him/her before but he/she seemed friendly and very very hungry...a little scruffy too.&nbsp; Anyone recognize it?

				I do not believe this is your cat. It does not look like the pictures you posted.&nbsp; I am not the one telling you to act fast. I promise, if I thought it was your cat I would also urge you to act fast. In any case, I am out of town. If you want to try to check it out, hang around 34th Ave and 80th St around midnight.

				Look, I wasn&#039;t trying to be a jerk. If it was my cat, I&#039;d be looking at every stray that even remotely fit the description. The picture is of a grey and white cat that&#039;s been on the street and may be a little beat up and scrawny from not eating, and the picture is blurry. If he&#039;s not him, well, I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s hard to make the cat out clearly beyond the fact that he&#039;s grey and white. It seemed like a weird coincidence, you lost a grey and white cat, and a one shows up and someone reports it. In any event, I have nothing more to say except I truly hope you find your cat. Best of luck.

				In any way was I rude sir or madam. Why are so offensive? I have been very appreciative to all those that have been kind enough to even contact me. My question to you was, for you to let me know the location. Or to contact me yourself. In any event I did speak to the person that has been feeding this cat and she confirmed that it has no resemblance to mine. If you can confirm otherwise please let me know. thank you

				I think I saw the same cat from the first photo that marsap posted at the car dealership on the corner or Northern and 78th (north side of street). It looked healthier/cleaner than the photo. I took a photo through the fence. I didn&#039;t want to get too close because I could tell it was going to run away.

				Now looking back at deemoonlight&#039;s Kiko photos, I can tell this cat doesn&#039;t have the same tabby patterns in the gray that Kiko has. I really hope you find her.

				Yes it does look like the first picture. I cant tell if its mine. My cat was thin, short hair domestic and grey coming down the leftvfront leg. What is the name of the dealership. Maybe the cat stays there and i could go. Its hard without having a specific location. Thank u

				The car dealership on the corner or Northern Blvd and 78th Street (north[west] side of street). I think it is a Koeppel Nissan/used car dealer. Best of luck!

				I believe I saw your cat, Kiko, which looks like the original posted photo (refer to the young cat, comfortable and stretching) between 35th and 37th avenue and 78th/79th street in the Hampton Court Gardens. It didn&#039;t look anything like the cat that people keep discussing and posting - which upon scrutiny doesn&#039;t look like Kiko. It had the youthful look, similar face, meticulous fur patterns and had clean fur. It was dark, and I couldn&#039;t capture a photo. The young cat appeared strikingly friendly for a garden cat. It came up to us with a domestic demeanor (I was with a group of people).

				I wanted to relay what I can as soon as possible, and it is obviously inappropriate to call at this time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t catch a glimpse of its genital situation, albeit the cat seemed to correlate with your initial post.&nbsp; I am not guaranteeing this is absolutely your Kiko, but it seemed to resemble the photo you posted compared to the other cat sighting. May I suggest to go to one of the buildings first thing tomorrow or as soon as possible, provide and have several images of your Kiko and speak to a super or a resident at one of the several buildings on the 79th or 78th Street side to accompany you with accessing the garden.&nbsp; You should inquire to ask residents/building superintendents who are familiar with the garden to see how long they&#039;ve been aware of the cat living within the garden (presumably and hopefully Kiko). The cat did not seem as adaptive as the many garden cats that I&#039;ve seen and appeared rather friendly with clean shiny fur - Approaching humans yet timid in nature.&nbsp; Chances are the cat would still be about in the garden - In some of these buildings, they gravitate and live in the garden of certain building complexes.&nbsp; People are benevolent and feed the cats who linger. Please let me know the turn out. If this isn&#039;t your cat, I apologize for leading you on to false hopes but feel any semblance of a chance is well worth it - From one life-long pet owner and animal lover to another pet-owner.

				No luck. I received an email from one of the residents of Hampton Garden stating that the cat you were referring to belongs to one of the residents of the complex. The superindent from there was kind enough to let me walk the garden. I also went to 80th and 34th where I was told that a similiar cat goes by there as well. It is going to be very hard if someone does not hold the cat in a stbla place where I could go directly to. Otherwise by the time I get anywhere the cat will be traveling around :0(
