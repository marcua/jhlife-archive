					Dear Friends &amp; Neighbors,<br /><br />Please join the family of Julio Rivera, Leonor Garzon (the mother of Edgar Garzon) and me on Friday night, July 2nd to mark the 20th Anniversary of the anti-gay murder of Julio Rivera.&nbsp; The vigil will take place from 8 PM - 9 PM on the corner of 37 Avenue and 78 Street in Jackson Heights in front of PS 69 where Julio died.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Julio Rivera was murdered by three self-described white supremacist skinheads out &quot;hunting for a homo to kill&quot; on July 2, 1990.&nbsp; We will gather to honor Julio&#039;s life and to also call attention to the fact that these terrible hate crimes still occur not only to LGBT people but to many others including immigrants and Latinos (among others) as witnessed by a string of recent attacks in Brooklyn and Staten Island. <br /><br />I hope you can join us as we stand to say Julio did not die in vain and that, in fact, his murder led to the creation of the current LGBT rights movement in Queens helping thousands upon thousands of people.<br /><br />Please try to come.&nbsp; Thanks for your time and consideration.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel Dromm<br />NYC Council Member<br /><a href="http://www.DanielDromm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.DanielDromm.com</a>

This yearâ€™s budget is likely to be one of the leanest in recent memory, with many services and institutions on the line for potential cuts. As your City Council representative, I am committed to protecting and maintaining the essential services and functions that we all rely on including fire, police, education, libraries, senior centers, health care, parks and so much more.&nbsp; It is our responsibility to explore options for increasing revenue to maintain essential services and a strong city.<br />&nbsp;<br />The City Council plays a key role in negotiating the Cityâ€™s final budget, and before we take on that task,&nbsp; I would like to hear what you have to say. Follow this link <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25</a> to make your voice heard on the choices the city should make in these tough economic times.<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25</a></strong></span><br /><br />I am working with my colleagues in the New York City Council Progressive Caucus to gather input from everyone. Your input can be a valuable part of this process â€“ and we want you to weigh in on the options we have for making cuts and raising revenue. I hope you will join up with interested New Yorkers from around the city to fill out this quick survey <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.surveymonkey.com/nycbudget25</a>. And once you are done, please forward the link to your friends.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for your participation, and look out for a report back on what we learn from this survey in a few weeks.<br />&nbsp;<br />Council Member DANIEL DROMM<br />New York City Council, 25th District<br /><a href="http://www.danieldromm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.danieldromm.com</a><br /><br />

					<img src="http://www.danieldromm.com/images/banner.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Dear Friends, Neighbors, and Supporters,<br />&nbsp;<br />We are very proud to announce that the Working Families Party (WFP) has endorsed our City Council campaign. The WFPâ€™s strong campaign operations, ability to mobilize grassroots and institutional support, and impressive record of electoral victories in New York City makes this endorsement a significant boost to our movement for progressive change in Queens.<br />&nbsp;<br />I look forward to being an advocate in the City Council for the working families of Queens. I will fight for good jobs and affordable housing. I will stand up for equality and be a strong voice for our under-represented community. We need new leadership that produces results. Our campaign represents a real hope for change, a departure from self-serving politicians who reject voters on term limits, a departure from excuses and distractions, and an opportunity to invest in our future.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Danny Dromm is exactly the kind of progressive, community-oriented candidate that we need on the City Council. After 25 years as a public school teacher and a bilingual progressive voice in Queens, there&#039;s no doubt that Danny knows and loves his community, and will work every day on the City Council for good schools, affordable neighborhoods, and real opportunities for success for all New Yorkers,&quot; said Jose Schiffino, WFP Queens Chapter Leader.<br />&nbsp;<br />We need your help now more than ever to bring progressive change to Queens. A key part of our campaign is petitioning to get on the ballot. This is a great way to get involved and be a major part of our movement. We will be hosting a kickoff event and petition training on Saturday, June 6th at 10am at our new campaign headquarters at 77-15 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights. We will be training attendees on how to collect signatures and discussing our plans as we move into the next phase of the campaign. <br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u">Key Upcoming Events</span><br />Saturday 6/6/09 10am Official Campaign Kickoff Event @ Campaign HQ 77-15 37th Avenue, Jackson Heights<br />Saturday 6/6/09 11am Petition Training<br />Sunday 6/7/09 10am Pre-Parade Fundraiser at Cavalier Restaurant 85-19 37th Ave, Jackson Heights&nbsp; <br />Sunday 6/7/09 12pm Queens Pride Parade -- March with Danny!<br />Tuesday 6/9/09 Petitioning Begins<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information, please call us at (718) 457-2928 or email us at <a href="mailto:info@danieldromm.com" class="bbc_email">info@danieldromm.com</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br />Sincerely,<br />&nbsp;<br />Daniel Dromm<br /><a href="http://www.DanielDromm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.DanielDromm.com</a> <br /><br />endorsed by:<br /><img src="http://www.danieldromm.com/images/working-families.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><img src="http://www.danieldromm.com/images/uft.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:kuyQtNWYZ--xLM:http://www.danieldromm.com/site/news/currentevents/uploaded_images/NYLHVVert-744313.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />

One resident&#039;s car <br />was completely destroyed. In addition, many neighbors were awoken by the explosion and by the noise from the <br />fire trucks that responded. The FDNY contacted Con Edison and the fire was brought under control a short while <br />later. Con Ed worked on the problem for most of the day.<br /><br />Upon hearing of the fire, I went to the site and took the above photographs. <br />I was shocked by what I saw. Con Ed left the transformer covers ajar with wires clearly visible. <br />They told residents that they would return on Tuesday to fix the wires.<br /><br />This is clearly unacceptable. <br />I contacted Council Member Eric Gioia&#039;s office. <br />He will be holding a press conference to immediately demand action from Con Ed at 10 AM on Thursday morning on the corner of 80th Street and 35th Avenue.<br /><br />Once again, Con Edison has let the people down. <br />This is at least the fourth time a feeder cable has caught on fire on 80th Street in the last few years.<br /><br />What does it take for Con Edison to pay attention? <br />Does someone have to die?<br /><br />While I cannot be at the press conference tomorrow because I am a NYC public school teacher, <br />my sentiments go out to the residents who have to deal with the fear that Con Ed will do absolutely nothing to improve the situation.<br /><br />I agree with the residents that Con Ed must inspect all the surrounding cables and replace the old wires immediately. <br />Additionally, Con Ed must fully pay to replace the resident&#039;s car which was lost in the fire.<br /><br />Together we must demand that Con Edison protect the residents of our neighborhood from this ever happening again.&quot;<br /><br />To learn more, please email me at <a href="mailto:danieldromm@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">danieldromm@yahoo.com</a> or visit my website: <a href="http://www.danieldromm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.danieldromm.com</a>

					Daniel Dromm is running for New York City Council to improve the quality of life in our community. Residential parking permits are a major part of Dromm&#039;s platform to improve transporation in our area. <br /><br />Take a look at the issues and solutions on the campaign&#039;s website:<br /><a href="http://danieldromm.com/site/issues/transportation.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://danieldromm.com/site/issues/transportation.html</a><br /><br /><img src="http://danieldromm.com/images/banner.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Transportation</span><br /><strong>Creating Parking Permits for Residents &amp; the Installation of Muni-meters for Parking in Commercial District</strong><br /><br />A major contributor to traffic congestion is simply motorists driving around looking for parking. By establishing a residential parking permit, the city can reduce wasteful driving by guaranteeing drivers a spot in their local area. As your city council representative, Daniel Dromm will ensure that the Department of Transportation installs muni-meters in the commercial districts of our neighborhood. Muni-meters are much more effective devices for improving parking turn-over and preventing meter abuse.<br /><br /><strong>Improving Pedestrian Safety</strong><br /><br />Our city&#039;s streets and intersections expose pedestrians to unacceptable risks. In particular, many senior citizens are often the victims of crashes with motor vehicles in our area. As your city council representative, Daniel Dromm will introduce legislation to give pedestrians priority over motorists at all intersections. He will direct the Department of Transportation to get people across the street in a safer fashion by retiming traffic signals to allow for more time to cross the street, installing pedestrian ramps flush with the street to make ascending and descending the curb possible for all users, extending curbs at intersections to make pedestrians more visible, and placing bollards at these curb extensions to prevent trucks and buses from driving into pedestrians while turning.<br /><br /><strong>Reducing Traffic Congestion</strong><br /><br />Our area experiences severe traffic congestion because of intense commercial and retail activity that caters to motorists within a densely populated residential area. Residents have regularly identified traffic congestion is the most frustrating problem in our district. As your city council representative, Daniel Dromm is committed to solving this problem. Studies have identified three areas which can successfully reduce traffic congestion: education, engineering and enforcement. He will work the Department of Transportation to look into engineering solutions as such traffic calming and rebalancing the street grid. Dromm will ask the local merchants to educate their customers about local traffic laws. He will also co-ordinate increased traffic enforcement with the local precinct.

His experience and dedication to the community has led to Dromm being overwhelming elected Democratic District Leader in the 39th Assembly District, Part A (Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Corona and Woodside in Queens) in 2002 and re-elected in 2004, 2006 and 2008.<br /><br />Daniel Dromm is an award-winning New York City public school teacher. Since 1984, he has instructed and inspired thousands of students at PS 199Q in Queens. In 2006, Dromm was chosen as Outstanding Teacher of the Year by his school&#039;s principal...Dromm took a lead role in implementing several successful projects such as the &quot;Philosophy for Children&quot; project and the Integrated Language Arts project. He was hand-picked by the New York City Opera to give a workshop at Lincoln Center on bringing opera into the classroom. In 1997, along with colleague Barbara Baruch, Dromm won the &#039;UFT Kid&#039;s Day on Broadway&#039; grant for his school. He has received awards from both the District and from the PTA for his dedication to students...<br /><br />In 1992, Dromm courageously came out as an openly gay teacher. The story became front-page news in daily newspapers throughout the city. The ensuing battle tested Dromm&#039;s resolve as a fighter who is unafraid to take on the powers that be. Dromm defeated several unsuccessful attempts to remove him from his job and became a role model for equality in the workplace. This episode in Dromm&#039;s life illustrated to him how important tenure is as a protection for teachers.<br /><br />You can see who has endorsed Dromm (including Mark Green and the UFT) here: <a href="http://danieldromm.com/site/about_danny/Endorments.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://danieldromm.com/site/about_danny/Endorments.html</a>
