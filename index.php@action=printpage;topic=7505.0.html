				I must say I was very impressed by the reopened produce market on 78th St. and 37th Av. as I walked past on my way to the subway this morning. Beautiful displays outside and at the front of the store, and I loved all the woven baskets hanging from the ceiling. From what I saw, their prices on fruit and vegetables seemed very good... I can&#039;t wait to stop and shop on my way home tonight! Looks like a great new addition to the neighborhood.

				Checked out this place last evening and am impressed. Neither a standard produce stand nor bodega, it reminds me of the Parrot Coffee stores in Astoria and Sunnyside, at least in terms of its more Euro-leaning stock. Unlike Parrot it doesn&#039;t sell homemade items, or products in bulk, but there is a solid selection of nuts and dried fruit packaged at some local bulk facility. It complements Trade Fair, Italian Farms and the newly re-opened Polish deli -- an excellent addition to the neighborhood!&nbsp;

				I am really knocked out by Lemon Farm. I returned for another, slower browse-through today, and came away even more impressed with what I take to be the basic premise of the store: boutique-ish, Euro-style, high-end items that aren&#8217;t carried by Trade Fair or Met Foods.<br /><br />First and foremost: <em><strong>Jackson Heights finally has a location where Plugr&#225; European-Style Butter is sold.</strong></em> BAM! Total win!&nbsp; :rockon:<br /><br />The dairy goods, breads, pastas (HUGE selection), olive oils, nuts &amp; dried fruits,.. all of a rather elevated quality level for this nabe.<br /><br />And the produce!! Blazingly high-quality stuff.<br /><br />And yes, the sweetest brand-new store cat around.&nbsp; :smitten:

				&nbsp;Bulls eye in terms of a fine addition to our 37th Street shopping area. Was one of the dazed, deliriously happy customers in there today.<br />I forecast this place doing really well. I hope it raises the bar for some other merchants on the strip now as I like and patronize them but<br />they could do more to keep up both maintenance and appearances. <br />&nbsp;Thank you Lemon Farm folks!!

				<strong>[dons Culinary Geek cap]</strong><br /><br />Regular US-made unsalted butter - primarily for baking rather than table use - is 80% milkfat. European, and specifically French, butters are 80% milkfat. Which means that baked goods <em>(hello! croissants!)</em> are going to be richer tasting, flakier, and considerably more pleasing to consume.<br /><br />The secret is the decreased water content in the butter.<br /><br />Plugrá is among the best imported butters of this kind. And Lemon Farm carries it!!&nbsp; :laugh:

				<strong>UPDATE</strong><br /><br />I went back to the shop yet again this afternoon; this time for some artisan bread. Selecting a package that looked interesting, some clues presented themselves.<br /><br />Chatting with the very affable owner (I assume it is his wife and son who also staff the store), I learned that most of the foreign-looking labels on products there are <em><strong>Turkish</strong></em>. The familyâ€™s from Turkey!<br /><br />He also said this pita bread I bought was fabulous, and that if it got a little stale in a couple of days, 3 minutes in the oven would return it to excellent form.<br /><br />Hello. We have a <em><strong>Turkish. Market. In. Jackson. Heights.</strong></em>

				Anew addition to the neighborhood!&nbsp; Yahoo....very good fresh fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Prices are less than the supermarket ( Clam shell organic wild arugula is $3.99, organic milk is $4.99) a good selection of olive oils, pastas ( De Cecco and specialty brands) Greek and Turkish specialties - taramasalata, dolma, pita breads, coffee beans.&nbsp; The people are nice and the place is charming and clean!&nbsp; Not a true gourmet store but definitely an improvement on what is in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Lets all support them and shop there. Good luck Lemon Tree!!

				The owner of Lemon Farm is open to stocking higher-quality food items not found in other neighborhood stores. I asked him to carry Bee Raw Honey (http://beeraw.com/) and he got it in within a week and is selling each bottle in the line for only $9.99, which is 50 percent less than what some stores in Manhattan are charging. I have also put him in contact with the folks from Z Crackers (http://www.savorypie.com/) and Artisanal Cheese (www.artisanalcheese.com; the company has a grab-and-go line) and I&#039;m hoping he will carry their products as well. I encourage everyone to support this store and these products, specifically, as the owner is a potential agent for culinary change in the neighborhood. The more we demonstrate that their is demand for the aforementioned items and others like them, the more quickly he will add them to the store&#039;s shelves. I will report back about any new items he stocks.

				Yes, it&#039;s a really nice place, and I like that they carry all these European products. Cheery Farms -- which used to be next to Jan&#039;s on 37th Ave and also run by Turkish owners -- used to carry similar products until they decided to turn into a regular bodega and went downhill from there. <br /><br />Nice addition, no doubt! <br /><br />@Jeff re: baskets: Mi Tierras started using them after the renovation a couple of years ago, and just recently C-Town did, too. So they are definitely in fashion.

				Lemon Farm is now carrying four cheeses from Artisanal Premium Cheese (www.artisanalcheese.com): an aged gouda, a camenbert, a tomme fermier d&#039;alsace and geit en stad. This is the only store I&#039;m aware of in all of Queens that carries Artisanal&#039;s pre-packed line. Artisanal is one of the two or three top cheese sellers in the U.S., along with Zingerman&#039;s in Ann Arbor and Murray&#039;s in NYC. I strongly encourage Jackson Heights residents to try these cheeses. They are far better examples of gouda and camenbert, for example, than you will find in the supermarket. The more we demonstrate that their is demand for these types of food products here, the more interesting and esoteric ones he will order. Artisanal offers many more pre-packaged cheeses but their salesman wanted to start&nbsp; with some easily accessible ones. John, the owner, is also hoping to stock Eli&#039;s and Z Crackers in the coming weeks, both of which will be a nice change from the ubiquitous Carr&#039;s that every store sells.&nbsp;

				Here is the latest update on the merchandise being stocked: John, the owner, is now carrying the full line of Z Crackers (http://www.savorypie.com/) and will be getting Hot Bread Kitchen&#039;s (www.hotbreadkitchen.org) Armenian lavash crackers in starting this Sunday. He is expecting another shipment of Artisanal Premium Cheese shortly and I have encouraged him to ask the salesman to rotate the selection. Food Should Taste Good (http://www.foodshouldtastegood.com) all-natural tortilla chips are also on order. This is an excellent product and one that you might ordinarily have to go to Whole Foods to get. None of these products are currently available in other neighborhood stores. We are slowly making progress broadening the food offerings to neighborhood residents and at the same time affording John and his colleague Adam a stronger opportunity to succeed by giving their store a distinctive point of view (i.e. you can get both staples and goods unavailable elsewhere on 37th Avenue).

				I also discovered that they are now selling eight-ounce bars of one-year-aged and maple-smoked Grafton cheddar for $2.99, which I told Adam had to be mismarked. He said, no, that was the correct price. That is a ridiculous deal. I&#039;m hoping that they get the two-year in, too. Adam also said they&#039;re trying to get Applegate organic and natural meats in, which I know a lot of parents in the neighborhood would appreciate for their kids. I&#039;ve encouraged him to try and get some Niman Ranch products in. Maybe, just maybe, we&#039;ll even see Nueske&#039;s bacon one day, but perhaps I&#039;m getting ahead of myself.

				They just got in two new cheeses from Artisanal: Uplands Pleasant Ridge Reserve, which won the 2010 American Cheese Society&#039;s Gold Medal, besting 1,400 other American cheeses (it&#039;s also won best cheese in its class for the past three years) and North Country Blue from Minnesota, a cheese I&#039;ve never even seen in Murray&#039;s or Fairway.

				I am happy to report that John and Adam, the co-owners of the store, just got in Applegate organic and natural meats, including the company&#039;s bacon, roasted turkey and ham. I&#039;m hoping they eventually start carrying Niman Ranch Fearless Franks and bacon, too, as the same company that distributes Applegate in New York also distributes Niman Ranch products. The store is now also selling Food Should Taste Good tortilla chips, an excellent brand, and Bruce Cost&#039;s Fresh Ginger Ginger Ale, a stellar ginger soda, in four flavors. These are all great additions and I encourage everyone to shop at the store and show John and Adam that there is demand for these products. Another item on my wish list is Olli Salumeria (http://www.ollisalumeria.com) whose charcuterie is up there with Fra&#039; Mani&#039;s. The one advantage that Olli&#039;s stuff has is that it&#039;s vacuum packed and has a long shelf life. Feel free to post items that you would like the story to carry and I will let them know.

				Board users might be interested to know that Lemon Farm now carries wedges of Parmigiano-Reggiano, the real deal and &quot;King of Cheeses.&quot; Best of all the price is $14 something a pound (can&#039;t recall the exact amount), which is significantly less than what Whole Foods charges ($19.99) and one of the lowest prices you&#039;ll find around town. John and Adam are also now carrying Old Chatham Sheepherding Co. yogurt and cheeses, and the full line of pre-packaged Artisanal cheeses, including Grassias from Texas. For those interested in high-quality tuna, I recommend the Tonino brand they carry, which they&#039;ve priced, again, significantly less than what Whole Foods charges.

				Another update on new goods John and Adam are now stocking at the store: Even more cheeses from Artisanal Premium Cheese, including Terraluna from Utah and an organic Pecorino Sardo; Ducktrap River smoked mackerel (hopefully, they&#039;ll get the pastrami salmon and trout in, too); an assortment of smoked fish from Echo Falls; Tate&#039;s cookies; Nancy Adams Chocolate Covered Graham Crackers; Tyrrell&#039;s potato chips (quite good); and a brand of pate the name of which I can&#039;t recall. Regarding Liberte yogurt, John says he had it in stock for a time but then wasn&#039;t able to procure it again. He is going to try again.<br /><br />Happy holidays,<br /><br />Ben

				Lemon Farm has replaced Trade Fair and Met for me for many of my staples.&nbsp; The prices are usually on par or better than the other grocery stores, and the fruit &amp; veg prices are better than at the green grocer down the street.&nbsp; I&#039;m usually able to find everything that I need there.&nbsp; A few things (especially dairy products - they never seem to have cream/half &amp; half) have me going elsewhere but Lemon Farm is usually my first choice.&nbsp; The fresh coffee beans are quite good, too, and much cheaper than what I&#039;m used to paying at Whole Foods.&nbsp; This is a VERY welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I&#039;d like to see them stick around for a while! :rockon:

				I am pleased to report some new products that Lemon Farm is now carrying. For starters, John and Adam are carrying Olli Salami, arguably, the country&#039;s best new artisan salami producer. The price, $8.49, is one of the best in the city, too. I strongly encourage everyone to try the full line from this brand, which is sold at Whole Foods, Murray&#039;s, Fairway and other fine stores. What&#039;s especially appealing is that the sausages are vacuum-packed and you can keep them in your fridge for a very long time, unlike those such as Fra&#039;Mani that are wrapped in paper and tend to dry out quickly.&nbsp; P<br /><br />Lemon Farm is also carrying Rustic Bakery and Beer Flats crackers, both, high-quality, of-the-moment producers, a couple of types of truffle oils and and Nielsen-Massey vanilla extract, which is basically the best you can buy.

				I am pleased to report that in addition to now selling burrata and buffalo mozzarella, at my request, John and Adam are now selling Dave&#039;s Coffee Syrup (http://www.davescoffeestore.com/Coffee-Syrup-s/86.htm), a fantastic, all-natural product that I was recently introduced to by a J.H. neighbor with a house in R.I. This stuff is amazing over ice cream, in coffee egg creams and in cocktails, among many other uses, and has a perfect viscosity for pouring, meaning it&#039;s not too thick or thin. I strongly encourage everyone to try it. The product was an Editor&#039;s Pick in the May issue of Food &amp; Wine and recently won &quot;Best New Product Packaging&quot; at the most recent Specialty Coffee Convention in Boston. I spoke with Dave Lanning of Dave&#039;s and he confirmed that the product is sold in a few smart stores in Brooklyn but nowhere else in Queens. It is currently available at Whole Foods, but not in our region. I urge everyone to try it. If it sells well, I will encourage Adam and John to stock the company&#039;s other flavors.

				So sorry to hear about your disapproval with the tone of some of these updates. Perhaps it might be best if I, at least, explain my vociferous support; can&#039;t speak for others. John and Adam are Turkish immigrants as far as I can gather. English is not their first language and they have no in-store demos or signage that would otherwise alert customers of these new products.&nbsp; Many of the products that I and others have urged them to carry (e.g. buratta) are extremely perishable and expensive, therefore, it&#039;s imperative for potential customers to know when they are in stock so that a market for the products can develop in the community. If the community doesn&#039;t know about the products, then they will languish or spoil, forcing John and Adam to revert to stocking more generic foods -- and then there won&#039;t be any reason to post updates here. If you care about great food products, and are aware of how unusual it is for a store in Jackson Heights like theirs to carry, say, Olli salami or this coffee syrup, which is not even available in Manhattan yet, then you naturally want to share the news with others. Thanks so much for understanding.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I love that cat. And I agree with past posters that the best way to deal with a concern like this is to simply talk with the owners themselves, who are very approachable. They seem to have responded extremely quickly to the exaggerated neighborhood fury that surrounded the USAgain dropbox a few months ago. I am actually pretty surprised by the sporadic but noticeable hostility that this very charming business receives on this forum. The public support clearly outweighs it, but the occasional hostility focused on this store is bizarre.

				Apologies for the delayed response. I haven&#039;t had time to check in on the board the past few months. Adam and John did say they were getting in organic kale. I will follow-up with them now about it. <br /><br />I got on the board today to say that, at my request, they&#039;re now carrying Brooklyn Hot Dogs, a superb new brand that I first came upon at Murray&#039;s. I encourage everyone to try them. My preferred way to cook them is to roast them because that method highlights their admirable &quot;snap&quot; and smokiness. For what it&#039;s worth, while the hot dogs are not advertised as low-fat, relative to others they have very little fat because they&#039;re made with lean beef. You can have a couple and still feel like you&#039;re eating something relatively light. <br /><br />John and Adam have also brought in a line of high-end honey from New Zealand (perhaps keep it mind as a gift instead of maybe a bottle of wine), plus new brands of chocolates such as Vosges Haut Chocolat and Chuao. <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Ben

				I didn&#039;t notice this thread before and am cracking up at the cat licking vegetables.&nbsp; I grew up in farm country out on the tip of Long Island and worked on them starting when I was 13 (every summer until college).&nbsp; The migrant laborers used to pee wherever they felt like it, including right onto the bushels of fruit we had just picked.&nbsp; It taught me to wash my produce very very well.&nbsp; I just assume everything I buy has been peed on and wash accordingly.<br /><br />So, to me, a vegetable licked by a cat sounds kind of quaint.&nbsp;

				That cat is so adorable. The last time I was there, I was contemplating which butter to buy when I felt something soft and furry gently paw my ankle, and I turned around to find the cat inviting me to stroke her stomach. It made me laugh out loud. <br /><br />Speaking of butter, you *must* try the Delitia Buffalo Milk Butter which is so heavenly creamy. Goes excellent with any mushroom dishes, risotto, what have you...so delicious.<br /><br />Anyone have any recommendations w/r/t to salami available at Lemon Farm? I took a look at all of them, but they&#039;re all produced in America, and to be blunt, I don&#039;t trust dairy or meat produced in America (sorry).

				I&#039;d like to second Shelby2&#039;s recommendation!&nbsp; Lemon Farm has a surprisingly robust selection of European imported goods, charcuterie, many forms of dairy goods (yogurts, etc.) not readily found elsewhere in our neighborhood, and quality breads.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t purchased a ton of produce there, but when I can&#039;t find a certain vegetable or herb elsewhere, they generally have it, and at not too bad a price.&nbsp; Plus, their collection of beautiful evil eyes behind the counter is unrivaled in JH!&nbsp; :D&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t been there, it&#039;s worth checking out.&nbsp; (Oh, and be sure to look up -- the ceilingscape is adorable).

				the selection is definitely great, and they do have a lot of items not otherwise found in the neighborhood. on the downside, however, you need to check the dates on perishable stuff like cheese/salumi. i&#039;ve had a few bad experiences of getting home and finding i&#039;d gotten something more than a couple of weeks out of date -- which the proprietors have always dealt with apologetically and without issue.

				We used to shop at Lemon Farm but the day or two after the last time we went there and used a credit card, our card info was stolen and used for items purchased in NYC.

Note that, at least back when we used to shop there, they have to take your card and hold it behind the counter rather than using a machine that lets you swipe in front of the register.<br /><br />In any case, my belief is nothing more than that: a personal belief.<br /><br />(We&#039;ve also had the out-of-date food problem there and they were fine about it.)

				More than once, we&#039;ve had fraudulent use of our credit cards when they were still on our possession, and the crooks were buying things with our credit card numbers all over the US, in states we had never been in. This must mean that they can get hold of the credit card numbers and whatever other info they need without ever actually touching the card. I have no idea how, but just sayin&#039;.

				I&#039;ve shopped at Lemon Farm consistently since they opened and have never had an issue with credit card info being stolen. That kind of thing can happen anywhere, especially online. Anyway, hardly seems a reason to stop shopping at a great store. I do most of my shopping there because even though they&#039;re small, they almost always have what I&#039;m looking for- including vegetarian sausage! Their cheese selection is excellent as well.
