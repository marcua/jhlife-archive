				Anyone know if there is a copy/print/fax/ship business in JH that does a paper shredding service? There was one in my old neighborhood (Shippers Express in Downtown Brooklyn) but I haven&#039;t found one here yet.

				Assembly Member DenDekker&#039;s next shredding and e-waste event is this Saturday, January 9th. His newsletter doesn&#039;t give the time or place, but he usually conducts it at the Jackson Heights Shopping Center in East Elmhurst. I imagine the hours are 9-1.
