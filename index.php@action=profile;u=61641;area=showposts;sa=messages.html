She seems to know a bit about this issue<br /><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-decriminalize-sex-work-in-ny-20190221-story.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-decriminalize-sex-work-in-ny-20190221-story.html</a><br /><br />2) This seems to be merely hearsay. Does anyone want to investigate, or call the police, or do something instead of just spreading rumors?<br /><br />3) Where am I going to get my food? My fruit? You&#039;ve never eaten food from a truck? You&#039;ve never bought produce from the guys on 75th and Roosevelt or 82nd or 37th? Should we boot the guy selling books on 37th and 81st? How about the juice trucks? Do they make the cut?<br /><br />4) I believe the flea market outside PS69 is a fundraiser. You want to deny money to the PTA? The people selling on 37th and 82nd are obviously doing some business or they wouldn&#039;t be there. That&#039;s how the free market works. I guess you&#039;re not a customer, so they should go too.<br /><br />In general, you should probably think about moving to a different neighborhood...or city, for that matter. I don&#039;t think you&#039;re cut out for New York.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And here it comes... I don&#039;t think the first poster said anything that was out of line or unreasonable. They were asking for: less junk on the streets, the ability to actually clean the streets, suggestions to help overcrowding/pedestrian flow, a reduction in drug dealing and prostitution, an increased police presence, etc. And you want them to move out of NYC. Funny...considering that I agree with all of the suggestions, am not a &quot;Boomer&quot; as someone else pointed out, and am a native, life-long NYer. <br /><br />As for your points:<br />1. Decriminalizing prostitution is most certainly NOT the answer and is going to make our problem worse. Jessica Ramos is a huge disappointment to our community in my opinion, but that is another forum.<br /><br />2. Have you walked by the corner of 79th and Roosevelt at night? I have many times. There are clear lookout guys loitering on the street and they are pretty menacing looking. I believe I read that people call the cops on them, but they keep coming back. Either way, something is going on there and it is too close to home for my liking. But god forbid we put a patrol car there because &quot;minority targeting...&quot;<br /><br />3. Have you shopped at the wonderful Lemon Farm, Growing Farm, Frutadona, Kims Brother? Great produce, great prices...NOT from the street. Have you walked by the 75th and Roosevelt fruit guy? Firstly, it&#039;s mobbed and people block the street, there&#039;s boxes all over, and people are gross and throw food scraps EVERYWHERE. Every day I get off the subway, I am stepping over orange and banana peels. As for food, to each his own, but I am personally averse to street food after I got sick. Never again.<br /><br />4. The school fundraiser is fine. I agree, it&#039;s nice for the community. I sort of wish it were a little less junk yard sale and a little more like Brooklyn Flea...but that&#039;s just me. <br /><br />As for your final comment: NO, I will definitely not be moving to a different neighborhood or out of my city. But, YES, I will join in the fight for improving our quality of life in the community. <br /><br /><br /><br /><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size">mod edit to get the quotes to appear correctly</span></em><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Uhh... let me guess you consider yourself part of the silent majority that&#039;s gonna take this country back? You are mad as hell and you&#039;re not going to take it anymore??

					I’ve been noticing that there’s a handful of older folks posting quite often here and a subset that have posted some VERY false info. In light of that I thought I’d share this article about how many of that age group lack digital literacy and are more susceptible to scams and false information.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/old-and-online-fake-news-aging-population" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/old-and-online-fake-news-aging-population</a><br /><br /><em>Four recent studies found that older Americans are more likely to consume and share false online news than those in other age groups, even when controlling for factors such as partisanship. Other research has found that older Americans have a poor or inaccurate grasp of how algorithms play a role in selecting what information is shown to them on social media, are worse than younger people at differentiating between reported news and opinion, and are less likely to register the brand of a news site they consume information from.</em><br /><br />Also this: Older Adults Are Especially Prone to Social Media Bubbles<br /><br />&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/older-adults-are-especially-prone-to-social-media-bubbles/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/older-adults-are-especially-prone-to-social-media-bubbles/</a>

					There were a handful of articles that have come out in the last few days that help clarify the situation. I think politicians were hoping the company would make concessions for the neighborhood but, Amazon wanted to use hardball retaliatory tactics instead. <br /><br />The mayor was on the radio last Friday and my ears perked up when I heard him mention the company had reached a framework with the unions. I thought to myself, it is likely why someone decided to pull the plug. <br /><a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/amazon-labor-1.27345235" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/amazon-labor-1.27345235</a><br /><br /><em>The union leaders, used to seeing union wages required for economic development projects, admitted the agreement wasn’t much. It allowed only for a fair vote by workers on whether to unionize, and provisions against retaliation against union supporters. “It was weak stuff,” Appelbaum said in an interview. “It wasn’t neutrality” in a union vote. “It was very, very basic and less than we would have wanted. <strong>But it was the first time anywhere we knew of that Amazon was willing to sit down and talk about a path to unionization.”</strong></em><br /><br />Then, James Patchett, CEO of the city’s Economic Development Corporation, who was GRILLED alongside Amazon reps at the two city council meetings had this to say to audience at Crain’s New York Business breakfast:<br /><br /><em> “They didn&#039;t perform particularly well at their public hearings,” “They never hired a single New Yorker to work for them to talk to New Yorkers. And they never really connected with people in the city.” </em><br /><br /><a href="http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/amazon_blame_game_patchett.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/amazon_blame_game_patchett.php</a><br /><br />And finally, a dirtbag landlord <strong>PAID</strong> protestors to fake support for Amazon.<br /><br /><a href="http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/pro-amazon_protesters_reportedly_pa.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://gothamist.com/2019/02/22/pro-amazon_protesters_reportedly_pa.php</a><br /><br /><em>At the protest, Musovic said that he&#039;d spent $1 million renovating his Long Island City buildings in anticipation of the company&#039;s arrival. He previously told Bloomberg that he&#039;d added new kitchens, flooring and other amenities to the apartments, <strong>with the expectation that he&#039;d be able to hike rents by at least 25 percent. Several developers also said they&#039;d bet big on the neighborhood, </strong>and many were devastated by Amazon&#039;s announcement last Thursday. </em><br /><br />Cuomo did not hold Amazon accountable to anyone in Queens. He was hoping for a LARGE photo op. City politicians were then having to clean up and press Amazon to make some agreements. <br /><br />The problem is, even if that happened, there is no way to account for the dirty tricks that people in real estate play and the inflated cost of living that would ensue before a shovel even goes into the ground.

					My point is that the campaign against the airplane noise was effective. It was a quality of life issue and so would have been dropping a headquarters of one of the largest global companies in already massively over built area. It&#039;s good to have rallied the neighborhood to oppose the flight patterns. Only now that it&#039;s less of an issue, it seems like you are not getting out as much.

					Hey, so, I was finally able to get through to Jeff Bezos after calling up Amazon a few times last week. He said he always hated Queens and that he really just wanted to continuously fly his helicopter over Jackson Heights after seeing the massive campaign that was launched against the air plane noise from LaGuardia. I think he was angry at those activists that complained about the flight patterns.

					It&#039;s been revealed why the aging boomers on the thread are such Amazon apologists. Quick to call a younger generation good for nothings as you shout into Alexa your latest Amazon order. Can&#039;t get off the coach to go down to the store but, complain about the changes in the neighborhood. <br /><br />Just sit back and drain Social Security for the future generations after fostering a financial crisis by utterly abusing credit. But, hey, I got mine. The &quot;ME&quot; generation indeed....
