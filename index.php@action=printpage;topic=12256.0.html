				http://realestate.nytimes.com/sales/detail/380-1201029/34-32-86th-Street-QUEENS-NY-11372<br /><br />Am I the only one who thinks this is an INSANE price for Jackson Heights? Yes, we all love JH and all that, but seriously, $1.45 million? I know a lot of the houses between 35th and 34th Avenues in the 80&#039;s are pretty big - but its a semi-detached, shared drive, tiny yard, regular lot - I can&#039;t see this price. I&#039;ve seen other semi-attached and fully attached listed for sale in recent months, all nice and big, but all under a million (usually in the 750-950 range, but who knows what they closed for). With no pics, I&#039;m suspicious this probably needs a ton of work too. Not familiar with this realtor either - so who knows if they are copying from another local guy who is (in)famous for inflated prices (yet tight lipped about eventual sale price) or if they truly think they&#039;ll be the first house in JH to go for over a million (plus mansion tax for the buyer). <br /><br />Curious about any thoughts you guys have to share - or is it just me?

				that does seem pretty over the top, and i have been in a couple of those houses, which are absolutely beautiful. actually looked at one on that block a few years ago -- a half-hearted attempt to switch from co op to house living that i soon abandoned -- for less than half that amount. they could probably push to near $1M on this, but i can&#039;t imagine topping that barrier.

				I&#039;ll actually walk down those blocks (86th &amp; 87th) when I&#039;m headed to 37th Ave because I really like the houses and the blocks themselves. <br />That said, if I had 1.45 mill to spend on a house, I wouldn&#039;t choose that one. If you notice, there are no pictures of the interior. A similar house sold a while back and the interior needed a lot of work and upgrading. I imagine this one is similar.

				*phew* I&#039;m glad its not just me! :-) <br /><br />I do think the interior must need substantial work/updating since there are no pics - which is kind of normal as a lot of these houses have had a few owners (sometimes the same family) since being built. I&#039;ve been in these houses as well as the ones across the street (the ones with the room over the garage) and while this is the one block in JH I would buy a house on (the one I covet is the one nearest to 35th Ave with the extra lot/large side yard bordering the old Christian Science Church), none of these are $1+ million houses (well, maybe because of the extra lot, the house I covet could get slightly over $1mill). <br /><br />I get the realtors want to list high for commission and the owners want the biggest return possible, but as a buyer, looking up previous sale prices (which you can on ACRIS for NYC) I would be &quot;WTF?&quot; seeing this price and knowing what comps in the neighborhood are. Some argue it will bring up all the prices, but I don&#039;t think that will ever be the case in JH. We&#039;re no Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights or Forest Hills either building or amenities wise plus as they&#039;re attached, why do you want to pay so much when you have no idea how the other owner treats their property/keeps it inside and what that may mean for you.

				1.5M for a 4/5 BR with 3+ bathrooms, lawn, yard, garage on a scenic + historic block with easy access to trains and freeway and Flushing-Meadows doesn&#039;t seem so insane to me, at least on paper.&nbsp; It&#039;s great the sellers are that optimistic. <br /><br />One could argue the same about paying 1.5M for a condo and not having any control over your neighbors as well. <br /><br />

				But with a condo -or co-op- you know going in you have shared walls, etc. and no real control over your neighbors (well, more control in a co-op, but still) but if they abuse &quot;house rules&quot;, you have redress. When owning a home, you really don&#039;t have any - suppose they&#039;re slobs, inviting vermin into theirs and by extension yours. Or if they don&#039;t keep up their yard, gardens and such. You may have spent the money, but if your neighbors&#039; places don&#039;t look nice and are well maintained, you&#039;ll never get it back (walk down 86th, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about - some owners obviously have house pride, others look like they came out of &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; - who wants to share a drive or a wall with that?).<br />I&#039;ve never seen a house in Queens sell for more than $1 million that is attached (this is a semi-detached - the left of the pic is the other house) with a shared driveway on a normal 40x80 or 40x100 lot. Plus who knows what the interior is like (no pics). It may be on an historic block, in an historic district, but it is not surrounded by million dollar homes - there&#039;s rentals up the block and around the corner and there are some former 1-families that were converted to 2 families and grandfathered in once the historic district came into play. I think these realtors (and the owner) are beyond delusional thinking they&#039;ll get anything near $1.45mill.

				It does sound a little high, but who knows.&nbsp; The prices on coops seem to have taken a sudden jump, so maybe this is projected to be happening with historic district houses at a higher percentage.&nbsp; The 2nd quarter real estate report for JH just came out and mentioned a record high for a house sale (single family) at $905K, so 1.45 mil does sound kind of high based on that.<br /><br />http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/<br /><br />When I looked up the property in ACRIS, it appeared that the last sale price was $850K in 2005.

				I don&#039;t know. Not so crazy to me. The beauty of some of these homes&nbsp; is that that haven&#039;t been&nbsp; &quot;upgraded&quot;. They contain a lot of the original wood detail and tile work. Renovated does not mean better. Also, I know for a fact that a house on the same block recently sold for approximately 960. It needed a ton of work. To me, having a house with a private garden and blessed parking is worth it. It&#039;s close to the city without the congestion. I think Jackson Heights is just catching up. I&#039;m originally from Brooklyn. When I left Dean street you couldn&#039;t give my house away. Now I wouldn&#039;t be able&nbsp; to afford it. What we have here in Jackson Heights is pretty special but we take it for granted.

				these houses -- and a couple other blocks of similar residences -- are pretty special, and might be worth the $1.5 million at some point down the road. it just seems slightly optimistic to set a price more than 50 percent above the all time high for a neighborhood just to test the waters. your dean street home is no doubt worth a lot more than it was when you left, but if you asked 2014 prices in 2004, you might have had trouble moving it, i&#039;d venture.

				While original details - moldings, tiles, arches, parquet floors, etc. - are all great and desirable, it all depends on how they&#039;ve been maintained in the 80+ years since these houses went up. I&#039;ve seen some (on 86th and other blocks) that are maintained fantastically, others that haven&#039;t been up kept in those 80+ years and look horrendous and still others that got &quot;updated&quot; in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s and are so badly dated now needing a full reno/restoration. I would say in general, based on my own experience/eyes and what&#039;s posted online (big red flags when kitchens and/or baths are described as &quot;vintage&quot; or &quot;original&quot; and the realtor shows no pics), you&#039;d be hard pressed to find any house in JH that doesn&#039;t need a good deal of work. The houses on 85, 86, and 87 are pretty special and it is no surprise the records are on that block for 1st and 2nd priciest ever sold (I thought $940K was the most recent/2nd highest in Dec &#039;13 with $999K the highest in 2007) - even when the rest of the neighborhood was in the crapper, those houses always sold high (as ACRIS showed for this one). I just think a jump of nearly 50% is pretty ballsy. There is much that needs to be improved in the neighborhood still before these houses can command $1+million prices (other than cash buyers looking to park their money like the condo buyers on 37th, if someone is paying $1+million, there are certain amenities they&#039;ll expect which the neighborhood doesn&#039;t have yet) - it can happen, but it will take longer in my opinion - and don&#039;t forget, buyers pay an additional &quot;Mansion Tax&quot; for any house bought for $1 million or more. Who knows tho - maybe this house will break the record and go for $1+million - or maybe it will just tie the record. It will be interesting to watch this one and see how it plays out.

				The 905K figure that I quoted is from the Beaudoin 2014 Q2 report, which says, &quot;The average was helped by what must be a record price for a one-family house- $905,000 - in, of course, the Historic District&quot;<br /><br />But you&#039;re right, there was one that went for $940K just last year, so I&#039;m not sure why this 2014 would list 905K as being a record.

				This house is across from my building&nbsp; and it appears very nice and well maintained from the outside, as it has for the entire time I&#039;ve lived over on this street (about 7 months) It hasn&#039;t just been cleaned up for sale. the sign just went up yesterday I think.<br /><br />&nbsp; Unfortunately it is attached to a house that is not well maintained, front yard is a disaster, landscaping is long gone and over grown and they don&#039;t sweep their sidewalk ever. I thought it was vacant (shades pulled down all the time), but I saw a tv set on last night while walking my dog.<br /><br />On the plus side is that there are only 2-3 houses on this block that could use some serious TLC, the rest are being used as one family houses (with familes!!!) with well groomed yards and swept sidewalks.

				The prices have gone up. The neighborhood is gentrifying. Just because you cannot afford it it doesn&#039;t mean that $$$ buyers from Manhattan and Brooklyn can&#039;t buy it. $1.5 mil buy nothing there. You are just being priced out. This house is not for you--it was always meant for wealthy individuals. Plus rates are so low real estate goes up everywhere.

				I don&#039;t think they are going to get 1.5 million for this house.&nbsp; Certainly they will get a good price.<br /><br />&nbsp; Jackson Heights is NOT there yet in terms of attracting truly wealthy buyers, we just don&#039;t have the infrastructure. A young attorney or doctor a few years out of school maybe, but not through the roof Manhattan level buyers.&nbsp; This block is solidly middle class and until 37th Avenue and Northern Boulvard change significantly, it&#039;s not going to be a dreaded and dramatic transformation that everyone fears.&nbsp; it&#039;s not just about housing, it&#039;s about grocery stores and other neighborhood amenties.

				You don&#039;t get it. Crown heights, prospect lefferts, ditmas park, bedford stuy have no amen ities and in some ways are worse than jh. Yet 1.5 mil has been reached for houses worse than this. As I said there si nothing middle class to this house--middle class people should rightly be priced out. There&#039;s a lot of cash around.

				Don&#039;t tell me I don&#039;t get.&nbsp; I&#039;m not unsophisticated. My husband&#039;s family owns a brownstone in Crown Heights that they bought in the 60&#039;s and is nown worth over a million dollars. But I have lived in JH for over eight years and there is a very different set of circumstances here. I didn&#039;t say gentrification wouldn&#039;t happen, it&#039;s just not happening in the way and at the pace you think it is.&nbsp; It will happen but i don&#039;t think it will be this year.&nbsp; Who knows maybe someone will buy the darn house at 1.45, but they better be ready for crummy supermarkets, limited amenities and a rail line that tranverses the sex trafficking capital of NYC.&nbsp; Oh how about the terrible schools and the blacktop that we call a park. Yes, I&#039;m happy here in JH. I love my neighbors, and i find my block pleasant and pretty. But UNTIL these things change it&#039;s not going to be the gentrification revolution that everyone fears.&nbsp;

				I am sorry but if YOU think that the house will bring 1.5 but not this year (so maybe the next) then it is not a bad idea to buy it now for that much. You are putting down the neighborhood but crammy supermarkets and bad schools are all over brooklyn but it did not prevent anyone to give millions to buy historic houses. People can wait if there is a promise of profit like your relative. that&#039;s why they are called gentrifiers. I am sure right now there is someone who has that kind of money and will offer 1.2 mil. You just need two to bid eachother and cough up the whole 1.5 mil.<br />

				I work in a law firm . One of the associates where I work grew up in JH, and her parents still live here. She is planning on buying a house in JH for herself and the extended family. She makes a good living but she is not a master of the universe. Another attorney who just left my firm to work at a NONPROFIT just bought an apartment here for himself and his wife (also an attorney who just started at a NONPROFIT), so they could start a family.<br />My husband and I are paralegals an make a good living, both have college degrees but enormous college loans. We just bought our second apartment here (sold the first). This is really more the type of buyer moving into JH, at least for now. These are not wealthy people but they make decent livings, perhaps more than working class but not Wall Street.&nbsp; Will the Masters of the Universe come here? Can&#039;t say, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll be for a few years.&nbsp; Yes, prices are skyrocketing but it&#039;s really more diminishing inventory and well, greed.&nbsp; Would I pay 1.45 million for a house when it appears my next door neighbor&#039;s attached house looks that way (like there might be squatters inside). That said, the rest of the block is very nice, the middle class owners proud and taking care of their properties.

				I didn&#039;t say anything about masters of universe--you said it. <br />An attorney couple that brings 400K can afford to give 1.2 mil or more for this.<br />A paralegal couple that brings 200K cannot.<br />It is clear why they ask for that much--they have already the attorney buyers. Also if this goes for 1.5 mil, I don&#039;t think that the house next to it will stay this way for long.

				an attorney working at a nonprofit makes about 70-80k, with a few years of work experience.<br /><br />Only attorneys working at white shoe firms make the kind of cash.&nbsp; &nbsp;90 per cent of attorneys in NYC make 125k or less. I might make more than your average attorney with the kind of overtime I have to do. But yeah someone making 400K could afford it. I&#039;d be happy to have my associate attorney as a neighbor. She went to Joan of Arc and takes her car to Pep Boys.<br /><br />Actually the attorney associate is about to give birth and has not bought a house as yet, she is waiting until after her child to be born and she is on leave so she has some time to look for a house. She told me 750K is alot and she doesn&#039;t know if she can spend that. So because she is an attorney doens&#039;t mean she is swimming in income, especially since she is probably helping out her parents.<br /><br />And the sign on the lawn went up yesterday, so I don&#039;t think they have buyers, but I don&#039;t know. On my block we have a lot of extended families who pool their resources then buy a house together. There is a recent middle aged couple with two children who bought a house a few doors down from the house in question, but they look pretty average to me.<br /><br />I walk my dog around the neighborhood and even in the historic district, vacant, crummy houses are not flying off the shelves. That might change but I&#039;m not seeing any contractors doing gut renos yet.

				No point in using reason when assessing value in NY real estate, right?&nbsp; The fact is, if I am shopping for a house (detached or not, with a yard, garage, and lawn) and my household income is &quot;only&quot; in the low to mid 6 figures, then my options are severely limited.&nbsp; Queens is a relative steal and that it has a solid middle-class foundation should only make it more attractive.&nbsp;

				I have to concur with what has been said - lack of amenities, infrastructure, ongoing loss of charm on our shopping streets, neighborhood upkeep - all contribute to why I don&#039;t think this place will go for what they are asking. I would in fact be surprised if it went for over $1 million. JH is not there yet, regardless of how you compare it to Brooklyn neighborhoods. I am a third generation JH resident - my family and I have rented and owned throughout the neighborhood since the 1920&#039;s - and I can tell you there has always been a mix - upper middle, straight middle and working classes in the neighborhood. For me, its not about being priced out of the neighborhood, its about reality check. One of my very good friends for many years is one of the top brokers in BK. She has seen my mother&#039;s place, an aunt&#039;s, my late uncle&#039;s and my own and she too at first equated the houses and co-ops to BK equivalents - saying how we should get much more then we were/did. But she did her research and realized that JH still has a bit to go before those prices hit the neighborhood - but has recommended continuously to buy and hold and then call her when the prices jump! lol <br />I think it is a mixed blessing for JH that many of the old local realtors seem to have been replaced by the larger companies. Many of those locals would keep pocket listings for who they knew may like it or might be looking and more importantly, they knew the neighborhood - good and bad - and were able to advise owners how to price appropriately - and if they liked you as the buyer, would let you know what to offer under the asking price. The larger companies have put JH on the map and helped raise prices. I heard a 3 bed in Southridge just went for $300K - unheard of previously but great news for Southridge and Northridge co-ops. I don&#039;t know if Laffey are local or not but at the end of the day, the market will determine the price, regardless of what realtors and sellers want or how we may feel about it here. I&#039;m still curious about the interior as I believe that will say a lot about how much this place will eventually sell for. <br />

				JH has a lot of potential, but it holds itself back by fearing every attempt to improve itself here as dangerous gentrification. If someone wants a little bistro in the neighborhood, there&#039;s hysteria. Then someone mentions that bistros can be found in Astoria or Woodside, and we&#039;re supposed to say, Oh yeah, I&#039;ll travel miles out of my way becuase there&#039;s already a little bistro in Woodside.&nbsp; Geez, can&#039;t we just have a few modest little things like a corner bistro right here IN JH without it turning into some kind of attack on the current face of the community?

				The recurring real estate fantasy is that prices can keep rising, rising, rising -- thanks to an ever-growing supply of people willing and able to pay.&nbsp; And if you buy and find that you can’t actually afford it, well then just sell the following year for a tidy profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />That actually may work for a while but over the long term it will not be sustainable -- at least outside of Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.&nbsp; The fact is there is a finite supply of people who can genuinely afford to pay $1.5 million for a house, even in NYC.&nbsp; You can be relatively well-heeled -- say part of an upper middle class professional household making comfortably into the six figures -- and $1.5 million is still going to be a bit of a stretch (unless you have some other independent income source, as I suppose some people do).&nbsp; <br /><br />And for the people who can readily afford it, there are plenty of other places to choose from with more cachet that JH (although personally, I much prefer it here).<br />

				It seems that these are good comparable neighborhoods. That Jackson Heights is closer to Manhattan and in an historic district bodes well. There is yet another house on 84th street in Jackson Heights on sale for 1.2 million. The only other area that I know about that would ask well over 1 million would be Forest Hills Gardens.

				Well there are actually quite a number of options in Queens for people with 1.5 million to spend.&nbsp; Sunnyside Gardens is a lovely and historic complex close to the City, which I think is generally under a million for a house (albeit smaller than the one on 86 St).&nbsp; Kew Gardens is further out, but it is connected to the train, is a beautiful neighborhood and has gorgeous houses selling in the 1 to 1.5 million range.&nbsp; Forest Hills Gardens, mentioned above, is connected to the train, very well established and very charming -- its more expensive but you could still find something quite nice for $1.5 million I&#039;m sure. <br /><br />Then, someone with $1.5 million to spend (and interested in a house with a yard like the place on 86th Street) could well look to inner suburbs in Westchester, like Bronxville or Pelham -- which have a very quick commute, are very well established and are affordable to people with $1.5 million in their pocket. <br /><br />For me, Jackson Heights beats them all.&nbsp; But, realistically, given that there are a relatively small group of people with that kind of money to spend and a relatively large number of options available to the people willing to spend it, I&#039;m not sure that JH is likely to catapult into the higher end category.&nbsp; But then again I could be wrong, who knows?

				Frankly I do not understand what you are saying.<br /><br />One by one you exclude the neighborhoods with similarly priced houses. Sunnyside histroic houses are too small. Comparable Kew Gardens and Forest hills are more expensive and further away. Other towns further away have much longer commutes withotu a subway. Then you conclude that the houses in JH should go for less for no reason. Puzzling.<br /><br />My question remains: where can you find a historic house, of this size, so close to the city at a lower price? <br />The answer is nowhere and not &quot;plenty&quot;.

				I guess most of us on this forum can not afford 1 million house anyway, not to mention the 1.5 million house. It&#039;s my understanding that even for the rich people who can afford the 1.5 million house, he still needs to make some sacrifices. If he doesn&#039;t have kids, the house is too much waste for him and he probably wants to buy coop/condo in manhattan so his commute is not even an issue.<br /><br />If he has kids, the school (either public or private) is probably number 1 issue. Forest Hills, Bayside, etc will be a much better place for the family with kids to find a single family house.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We can argue here forever about whether the house is worth 1.5 million. Eventually, it is the market (rational or irrational or bubble) that determines whether it is worth that amount of money.&nbsp; If the house is still on sale next year, then we know the house is overpriced today. If there is a buyer, then we will have a new record price for the single family house in Jackson Heights.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				A family than can afford a 1.5 million house does not send their kids to public school neither in Jackson Heights nor Forest Hills. Such a family will send kids to private so this is a moot point.<br /><br />My point is that there is no obvious reason why this house should not be asking 1.5 mil.

				Crazy price escalations are a benefit if you are selling and moving to a cheaper area.&nbsp; They are also an obvious benefit to realtors. Otherwise, however, home prices which are unaffordable to the vast majority of New Yorkers benefit no one. <br /><br />And if prices go up too high too quickly, which may be starting to happen in NYC, there is an obvious risk of an asset bubble -- which has devastating consequences when the increase is no longer sustainable and prices begin to move just as quickly in the opposite direction.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The average middle class person generally looks like someone who works in a office or store or similar workplace, neatly dressed but not fancy or ostentatious. If they own a car it is usually a mid-priced or less expensive car, often a suv, especially if they have children.&nbsp; This is a stereotype of course, but it tends to hold true in a general sense, regardless of ethnic background or region.&nbsp; You may disagree, but I don&#039;t think this is a very controversial depction of a average middle class person.

				I have no doubt that the house will sell for over a million.&nbsp; Maybe not full asking price but it will move quickly.&nbsp; People buying these homes are mostly from Manhattan and Brooklyn where 1+ mil is not uncommon.&nbsp; Here you get <strong>five</strong> very decent size bedrooms, parking for two cars, a private yard, low taxes, great restaurants, a fireplace and a short commute to anywhere (well maybe not Jersey).&nbsp; And let&#039;s not forget a full basement. Two bedrooms in Manhattan are easily over a million and you have high maintenance on top of that. This price is in line with what is happening all over the city.

				Couldn&#039;t agree with you more. The other thing to mention is most of the houses in Jackson Heights are solid brick and made with high end materials (i.e. Vermont slate roofing, wood flooring, etc). If you look at the prefabricated materials they used to make those monstrosities off the BQE in Williamsberg, the money is well worth the quality of construction here. Who needs a trendy café when I can do that in my own back yard green space.

				I think there will be a bidding war on this house. I&#039;ve seen so many homes in JH that were deplorable and they were asking in the high 700&#039;s. I also seen a home on 86/northern with so many ill repairs and illegal conversions&nbsp; priced at around 800k. That was six yrs ago. This is a great block and&nbsp; there is rarely a home for sale on it.&nbsp;

				Regardless of how many 100k&#039;s the listing price is off-target, I find it very bothersome that the listing agent couldn&#039;t be bothered to do any more work than taking a picture of the front of the house. When you are at a certain price point, any listing agent who isn&#039;t willing to undertake getting proper photos, floor plans, and every detail about the house into the sales campaign doesn&#039;t deserve the listing. This agent (Yoomesh Sharma) couldn&#039;t even manage to link to a proper page on the laffey taffy website.&nbsp; ::)<br />

				Very true. I&#039;m surprised an agency dealing with Landmark districts didn&#039;t get the listing.... Or at least someone knowledgeable about the architecture and style of yhe house/ neighborhood. It&#039;s really not marketed correctly.

				Ha!

There are houses all over the country that cost a fraction of this one that put it to shame. The only reason it appreciated is location and circumstances.&nbsp; And circumstances can change easily. There is not much value in itself.<br /><br />Of course you and others in this thread feed the hype because you have vested interests...<br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; The quote within this post has been modified to remove personal information.]</strong>

				The sale sign is up. Here we go again: a death by a million cuts.<br /><br />As others have mentioned there are other areas with faster commute to Manhattan, better schools, less density and parks such as Forest hills--no reason to drop a million here unless you like lots of people around you.

				Fair observations and criticisms. My personal experiences have been good, and (it&#039;s hearsay but I do speak to a lot of people about this) most of the people I know who send their kids to the local schools are as happy (or unhappy) with them as the people I know who chose private or charter or G&amp;T schools. That&#039;s why I was surprised about the comments here. To me our schools seem no worse than other schools in other areas. <br /><br />It&#039;s not the diversity that&#039;s a plus, many schools in other areas are probably more diverse when you look at the demographics. It&#039;s nice to have what we have but that&#039;s really a minor thing. To me, it mostly comes down to the administration and the teachers. Some of the teachers we&#039;ve had for our kids have been fantastic. Some not so much, but - again - that&#039;s also what I&#039;ve heard from other schools. <br /><br />It&#039;s clear that people have different standards for judging schools. One person&#039;s $1.2M house is another person&#039;s yurt&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12256.msg58724.html#msg58724">Quote from: theplanesland on September 08, 2014, 03:52:03 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />69 is incredibly huge and regimented, as you know, so it&#039;s tough for kids who may function better in a quieter atmosphere or one with a little more flexibility and personal attention.

				DISCLAIMER<br />I didn&#039;t mean to say that people might not be happy at the jackson heights schools. Many people who could be happy anywhere after all. I meant that according to sites such as greatschools.org the forest hills schools are rated much higher than the jackson heights ones. Ratings are based on objective criteria rather than satisfaction judgements.

				We are off topic but it&#039;s not only greatschools, all school sites (schooldiggers, etc) rank forest hill schools much higher.

				&nbsp;Lot&#039;s of Jackson Heights kids don&#039;t attend the public schools here. There are other options locally with parochial,<br />independent and charter. Forest Hills and Bayside schools are currently SUPER crowded whatever their previous<br />reputations have been. This makes for a cottage industry of extra&#039;s all over the borough like test prep and college<br />counseling which really should be included in the school day. Our local public schools work well for a number of <br />people but they are not really that diverse as in certain cultures favor one school over another and sway the <br />stats there so they do not look at all like the neighborhood diversity when you see schools let out for the day.<br />&nbsp; I would look at our schools visually for starters and see if you picture your kids in with the groups coming or <br />going from each school. Or will you be one of the many parents commuting with their kids very early/late <br />elsewhere or putting them on a school bus to some farther away Gifted/Talented scheme? We do have choices <br />here in JH though and by HS students are usually on the track to specialized schools or some program matching<br />their interest. The small HS&#039;s here (Garden School and Renaissance) and the Parochial schools have had some<br />outstanding college placements that I know of so if you think long term, remember to include them.
