				I&#039;ve been trying to give as much business as possible to smaller local businesses in these hard times, and I know others have been doing the same. Because I don&#039;t want these places to go out of business, but this is also a political time. I recently found out some of the larger businesses that support Trump - there are several sites on line.&nbsp; Locally Taco Bell, Blink, CVS, New Balance, and Home Depot all have higher ups that support Trump through their profits.&nbsp; There are many more, good to do a little research, so you are aware of where your money is going.

				Estee Lauder, Home Depot, CVS, Facebook, Airbnb, Taco Bell, and thousands of others. Good luck not spending money there for the next five years. I say yes do your research, and shop at the stores that support Trump Otherwise what’s going on today will be the new normal.

				If it&#039;s a big, publicly traded company, there&#039;s a really good chance at least one of the senior executives is a Trump supporter. It makes more sense to focus companies that are privately owned. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t that the deal with Soul Cycle and why people were kind of horrified to realize they were patronizing a business that put money directly in the pocket of someone who was a Trump donor?

				I think some of the big businesses are worse than others and I was pretty stunned by a few on the list.&nbsp; Whatever your politics, it&#039;s good to know who you are supporting with your purchases.&nbsp; Our spending money is one of our biggest votes.&nbsp;
