				I spent much of my life without a dishwasher, but the apartment I bought had one - yay! Now it won&#039;t drain and I&#039;m a little clueless about a fix. <br /><br />My super who is awesome at everything else unfortunately can&#039;t help and You Tube is failing me. I managed to drain it with a wet/dry vac, but now I guess I need to pay a professional to unplug the drain (as none of the holes on the bottom seem to let me in). Does anyone have a recommendation for someone who could do a simple job like this? I don&#039;t want to call a plumber and pay big bucks if at all possible, or somebody who will try to sell me a new machine. It&#039;s a probably 2 year old Frigidaire.<br /><br />Many thanks!

				This is not a recommendation since I&#039;ve never used this service, but I was recently doing some research for what I thought was a dishwasher issue (luckily it resolved itself) and came upon this site for Sears dishwasher repair. It doesn&#039;t matter if the dishwasher was purchased at Sears or not. There is a 20% off coupon that will pop up when you click on the link. https://www.searshomeservices.com/repair/dishwasher-repair-service <br /><br />I imagine anytime you get a repair person to come to your house, it&#039;s going to cost a lot.

				&nbsp;Look up this company on Yelp- Global Solutions Appliance Repair. The Queens number is 929/250-4328. Am in the middle<br />of same repair here and so far, am happy with these people who were highly recommended by a neighbor.

				Can’t recommend Nick’s Appliance Repair highly enough. He came to our place and repaired our 8 year old Bosch quickly and effectively, and his fee was very reasonable. DM me if you have questions. <br /><br />https://m.yelp.com/biz/nicks-appliance-service-and-repair-san-jose-7
