					We tried House of Inasal Friday night. Delicious food, good wine, great prices! Friendly service, though when it got crowded there were not enough waiters and we had a hard time getting anyone&#039;s attention, first to order dessert and then to get our check. Another tip—the special desserts we had read about in their Times review were not on the menu, so we ordered one that was. But we saw people with the other desserts. You have to ask, I guess.<br /><br />We&#039;ll go back soon--great place. Highly recommend.

					It&#039;s beginning to feel like these new restaurants that are supposedly on the way are actually pranks of some kind. <br /><br />An alternative explanation is that it&#039;s actually impossible to pull off opening a new restaurant in JH. Although Bachue managed it. But their owners already had one or two restaurants in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Where was this one supposed to be again?

					I was serious when I suggested PR help in this situation. What on earth is to be gained from getting into snarling fights on social media when preparing to open a new business? This is just insane, and someone needs to persuade the new business owners/investors of that fact and guide them in how best to interact with their potential new customer base. Seriously, they are planning to keep a list of customers to be banned from their establishment based on comments on this board? Why even say things like that and incite hostility? The people who live here and are interested enough in the neighborhood and its offerings to be reading this board are your customer base. <br /><br />As others have mentioned, some of the comments have been extremely condescending/arrogant/snobby, in a way that is very inappropriate for the spirit of this neighborhood and the people who choose to live here. You need to be politic and diplomatic and express support for other establishments in JH (rather than put-downs) while voicing your desire to offer the neighborhood something new and exciting. In other words, accentuate the positive, restrain yourself, and try not to make enemies. It&#039;s just common sense. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been very much excited about this new restaurant, but am kind of worried that it may crash and burn because of an inability to deal with the Community Board, the public, etc. in a rational, productive, positive way. These skills are extremely important to a successful business. (Have I just gotten myself banned? That would be a shame given that I live about a 2-minute walk away and am a devoted and frequent restaurant patron.)

					The image provided by Lalochezia is a joke, of course. For one thing, Radio Shack is out of business, so it&#039;s an outdated joke. Last we heard there was supposed to be some sort of upscale food store, part of a chain but no name provided, as well as a bank. I guess they will announce when they are ready. I am also dying to know. It will be nice when the building is finally back.

					I agree with Redge about the aesthetics of the place. That was pretty much my reaction when I peeked inside before they opened. It&#039;s always exciting to see a new place opening here--and disappointing when it&#039;s...well, disappointing.&nbsp;

I remember seeing a sign at the door of another neighborhood restaurant, this one on Northern, that people have recommended on this board. The sign said something about mandatory coat checking. Sounds like they are concerned about drugs and/or weapons. That sign alone would prompt me to never set foot in that establishment. Bouncers? Same thing. Not my idea of a pleasant atmosphere for a night out. Maybe the food is good, who knows? I would still feel the same way. Not the kind of place I want to spend time at. Not an atmosphere I am comfortable in. So--It&#039;s disappointing in a neighborhood that could sorely use more nice dining options.

					That&#039;s discouraging but not surprising. Welcome to local politics. It&#039;s not ideal, but I think it&#039;s quite common for restaurants in NYC to open without a liquor license at first. At least I have seen that often. Lots of places in that position do allow BYOB--so much so that I had no idea it was illegal until recently. It may be one of those realities you just have to put up with, unfortunately. These places eventually do get their license, but they operate without one for several months. I always thought that was just the way things happened--that it just took a long time to get the license.

					About the Queensboro: I have never seen any activity there--has there been any progress? Maybe I only go past at off hours. Looking forward to both new restaurants and especially Stew&#039;s, because it&#039;s less than a block from our apartment and what could be better? <br /><br />I also think it will elevate the whole block amazingly, although there already are some good food options. We love El Rico Tinto and we also think Due Fratelli has good pizza and Italian comfort food like chicken parm. We order from both places often. We also love the K&amp;L deli on the corner for deli-type things and basic, inexpensive takeout. <br /><br />But to have a really good restaurant in that spot again (we were fans of the late Mehfil) will be so great. And from the sound of it, this will be a unique offering in this neighborhood. Quite different from anything that&#039;s been seen here before. It&#039;s high time we got something like this in JH. I think it will be a big hit.

					What naysayers? Isn&#039;t everyone on this thread thrilled about this upcoming addition to the neighborhood?

					Okay, thank you, so now I know that the image of the woman has a cultural/mythological meaning. Not having a clue about that, to me it looked a little like what I mentioned before. I didn&#039;t write the name down and Google it and thus discover what the image is supposed to represent. Maybe they should include some words in their logo or a tagline or something to convey the meaning of the name. And re: &quot;haters,&quot; people are merely expressing opinions which, even if negative, hardly constitute &quot;hate.&quot; Some people might find the decor sophisticated, while others might find the same decor garish. I agree with the person who said it looks like it will be more of a bar-scene type place than a family restaurant. But I guess we&#039;ll see.

					Yeah, maybe the food will be good, but the aesthetics are unfortunate. On a happier note, Urubamba finally got their license to serve wine and beer, I noticed as I passed by yesterday. I really like that place and think their decor/atmosphere&nbsp; is charming.

					I think this place was the subject of a previous thread which I now cannot find. Is this the place that was being criticized because of its website and the suspicion that the owner was using images he/she did not pay for? I&#039;m not sure. However, I just walked past the site and what is up with that name/logo? Has anyone noticed? The name/logo (name begins with an H but I neglected to write it down) features the silhouette of a semi-clad woman who appears to be wearing something like a loin cloth. What is the meaning of this? It&#039;s supposed to be a bar/restaurant, but this makes it look more like a &quot;gentleman&#039;s club.&quot; I peeked in through a window in the construction shed and looked at the decor and all I can say is...no. Just—no. Disappointing. Just my opinion, of course. <br /><br /><strong><em>[Moderator&#039;s Note: Merged with previous thread]</em></strong>

					Stew, for historical photographs, have you tried contacting Daniel Karatzas, local realtor and author of a history of the neighborhood? He gives a yearly slide show of historical photographs of Jackson Heights on the day of the annual JHBG garden tour. I would think he&#039;d be a good source on photos, as I believe he spent years researching his book. <br /><br />Regarding the suggestion about trying to appeal to the landlord for uniform signage on that block— does one landlord own the entire block? Someone mentioned getting Hawthorne Ct residents to work on this--I&#039;m a Hawthorne Ct resident and would love to do anything I can to improve 37th Avenue. Other blocks on the avenue seem to have installed uniform signage. Is this something that the landlord initiates? How does it happen and why has it happened on other blocks but not this one, I wonder.
