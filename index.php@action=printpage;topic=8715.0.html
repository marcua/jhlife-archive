				Even though we asked and received question-mark looks in response, my guess is that we will not be the only ones to ask. The handsome Blink website it out there, and people in our area will surely see it. So whether from us or from others, those Executive employees will find out what’s going on sooner or later...<br /><br />Believe me, we to are hoping for a great gym in the area! I looked up the Yelp reviews for Blink Fitness in the NYC area, and was delighted to find the majority of them overwhelmingly positive.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=blink+fitness&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY&amp;ns=1 (http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=blink+fitness&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY&amp;ns=1)

				It&#039;s not uncommon for the owner of a business to withhold closure information from their staff for as long as possible, the thinking being that those that are aware of their impending unemployment will start looting. So, I wouldn&#039;t doubt that the lease deal is signed by Blink simply because the staff of the existing gym is unaware. Or was unaware, as they have now been tipped off.<br /><br />Build-out for a gym would take no more than 14 weeks, could be weeks faster if it is just cosmetic (i.e. if showers and toilets are remaining in place, but locker rooms are receiving new tile and a fresh coat of paint).

				Hello all..I am a member of Executive Fitness and spoke to the owner. They confirmed that Blink will be taking over their space. The current gym&#039;s lease is not being renenwed, it expires end of 2013 to early 2014 then Blink takes over.&nbsp; Sad to see, but very excited at a new, clean, enticing, gym. The current bldg, has a new landlord and seems to be pushing the current tenants out.

				I&#039;m sorry to be Debbie Downer, but I just wanted to relay a chat I had with a coworker - he was bitching about his gym two days ago and I asked where he went and he said Blink (the one in Nolita or Noho).&nbsp; He said it was great when it first opened and then it just fell apart and it got dirtier every day.&nbsp; You really get what you pay for ($20) -no towels, no classes, no free weights, teeny locker rooms (that might be because of the location) and they never clean the bathrooms.&nbsp; I was suprised that they only have machines.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to join a gym that doesn&#039;t have free weights or classes.<br /><br />He said he&#039;s been trying to quit and it&#039;s been a nightmare of them being extremely difficult and pulling out a bunch of hidden fees.&nbsp; Just be very careful if you join and get the cancellation policy spelled out for you very clearly.&nbsp; <br /><br />I went online after talking to him and I saw a bunch of similar complaints.&nbsp; <br />Hopefully this one will be nicer but the cancellation policy will still be the same, so just be aware.&nbsp;

				OK, so it may not be the total answer to my prayers.&nbsp; But $20 / month to have a nearby place where I can run inside during the winter months is worth it to me. <br /><br />I have to admit that I can&#039;t understand the business model if they don&#039;t have free weights.&nbsp; They could provide those at a small fraction of the cost of buying and maintaining machines, no?<br />

				I recently quit NYSC because it&#039;s very expensive and even Sunnyside is too far away for me.&nbsp; I thought I would go but getting on a subway to go to a gym is not as easy as you think it will be.&nbsp; Even they have ridiculous cancellation policies - I always read anything I sign so I know what the policies are.&nbsp; I did let them this area is starving for a good decent gym and to open up here, and I hope they do.&nbsp; But at this point, hell, I&#039;ll take Blink.&nbsp; Just going to adopt a wait and see attitude on it, and if I like what I see and if it&#039;s clean and comfortable, then I&#039;ll join up.&nbsp; At least it won&#039;t require a subway to get to and I can go home to shower.&nbsp; I understand it&#039;s along the lines of Planet Fitness but that&#039;s ok to me.

				I work in White Plains, and belong to the Blink there. It&#039;s pretty terrific. Complaints about there being no classes, towels, etc. are pretty irrelevant since the gyms are designed to be very basic (and thus the low cost). Their gyms are huge, have tons of equipment (especially cardio), are super clean, and have adequate locker rooms. They are not owned by Equinox, but Equinox does have a share in Blink. I belonged to Equinox in the past and I find Blink to be maintained (and cleaned) as well as Equinox.<br /><br />I was told that sales for JH will begin in early 2014 with a summer opening. The Astoria gym is opening in December.

				The most recent rumor I heard is that EFN, the current gym that is in the 78th St. space, will be moving up towards 84th/85th St.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t get any additional info.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid Blink will be completely overwhelmed with crowds, especially if it&#039;s new and cheap.&nbsp; So having another gym still in the neighborhood may ease the overcrowding somewhat.

				That&#039;s good EFN will stay in the neighborhood. It ought to ease overcrowding at both places, and offer options for people. I actually just joined Blink in Astoria recently. Management seems to be very good. It&#039;s always well-occupied, but never packed. The place is kept really clean. The atmosphere is friendly. But it&#039;s on Steinway, which is lined with gyms, so gym-goers are distributed along the commercial strip. It will be interesting to see how it goes in Jackson Heights, but with good management and some local competition, I think it will a success.

				Ok Guys, <br /><br />I dropped by Blink today and I&#039;ll share what I learned.<br /><br />1) They will open September<br /><br />2) If you sign up and pay $1 today, you save the start up fee of <br />&nbsp; a) $99 for Blue membership (Access to all locations expect Noho)<br />&nbsp; b) $49 Gray membership (Single club access)<br /><br />3) Their monthly fee is $20 for Blue (12 month agreement), $15 for Gray (No term agreement)<br /><br />4) Annual fee is $39 for Blue, $29 for Gray<br /><br />I with they are a little bit closer to my home, at least on the north side of Roosevelt avenue so I don&#039;t need to cross the busy and noisy street every time. =)<br />

				Great update! Thank you all for the info. It&#039;s tough to keep pushing back the date. But it does sound promising if the membership office is open. I have a Blink near work. Maybe I&#039;ll spring for the all-location, at least until they open here.<br /><br />My friend is a member at a Manhattan location. She says they are a great deal, so long as you are not looking for classes. The gym is clean and the equipment new and kept in good shape. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about the towel service.

				You can sign up online or go in to sign up for the $1 deal. They also have a layout of what the gym will look like once it&#039;s complete. It&#039;s about 18,000 square feet with tons of cardio equipment.

				I emailed my friend who was a member of the NoHo branch and asked what he meant about the free weights. He said they had no bench press station or squat rack and that they had a few free weights but no barbells. But that&#039;s a tiny location so maybe things will be different in JH. He ended up canceling because it was always so crowded (again, something I don&#039;t think will be an issue in JH) and because it got dirtier and dirtier as the months went by. He did say it was a good deal for a no frills gym. And then he warned me that there are a bunch of hidden fees when you try to cancel and that there is absolutely no way around paying them.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				My feeling is that it&#039;s more difficult than this to cancel, but here&#039;s what it says on the website:<br /><br />Our Gray membership allows you to cancel at anytime with 45 days notice.<br /><br />Our Blue and Green memberships are twelve-month agreements. You can cancel the agreement within the first year with 45 days notice and a $60 buyout fee is applied. After the first twelve months of membership, you can cancel with 45 days notice without a buyout fee.<br /><br />The two ways to cancel your membership are at the club or by certified mail sent to:<br /><br />Blink Member Services<br />386 Park Ave South<br />11th Floor<br />New York, NY 10016<br /><br />During the 45 days, you can utilize the facility and keep on blinking.

				I stopped by today.&nbsp; It was very busy with people signing up.&nbsp; I can tell it will be quite popular.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically like Astoria&#039;s Blink except all on one floor.&nbsp; I think they gutted the old place out.&nbsp; It&#039;s got a ton of cardio machines and lockers.&nbsp; The locker rooms are nice and clean.&nbsp; As with other Blinks, no towels or shampoo/conditioner is provided.&nbsp; But there is soap.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if they are waiting on more machines to come in, but the regular weight machines look sparse.&nbsp; I can see backup happening there during rush times, but other than that, all looks good.&nbsp; They have a lot of free bar bell type weights and an open area to stretch.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did not experience a sell but I think that&#039;s because I&#039;m already a member and they were too busy with everyone else.&nbsp; To be honest, I still hope another gym opens up to relieve the pressure on this one.&nbsp; I can see it being very busy.<br /><br />They open September 19th.

				After visiting yesterday, I have to say I&#039;m going to stick with NYSC even though it&#039;s much more inconvenient and expensive.&nbsp; I think it would just be hard for me to like going to Blink to work out.&nbsp; The room seemed cavernous and loud somehow, and even at 2:30 on a weekday afternoon it seemed about 10 times as busy as a NYSC would be at that hour.&nbsp; So it made me worry what the crowds and noise will be like at 6 pm in a few weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad Blink is here, but still have my fingers crossed that NYSC will eventually make it here as well.

				I like the way the Blink in Astoria is designed a lot better than the one here, that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot more open.&nbsp; This one feels cramped.&nbsp; I imagine the BO factor is going to suck.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad we at least have something now, but I do hope we get more gym options.

				<em><br />Do you think if you suggest adjusting the&nbsp; location of the power rack to management, there&#039;s a chance it could happen?&nbsp; Obviously the reasoning is solid.</em><br /><br />I would hope so...<br /><br />If they moved them ~6&#039;&nbsp; from the wall or rotated them 90 degrees and bought a couple more barbells, then yes this would double the amount of barbell work that could be done.<br /><br />They could also buy some 2.5lb weights while they were at it (if anyone does strength training, you know that for upper body, 5lb jumps in your maximum lift is appropriate!).<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I stopped by tonight around 9:30 to take a look around. I agree with Shelby2 - it was loud and cavernous. It was extremely busy as well, which although great to see, can be frustrating when you are trying to work out. The equipment did look like it was good quality and the price and location is a huge plus for me. I definitely can&#039;t say they I will sign up, but I also can&#039;t say that I won&#039;t at some point. I would miss many things from my current gym such as a pool and classes.

				Signed up this afternoon. It WAS pretty crowded but I got a good weights/cardio workout in. I think the crowd will thin out after the opening day excitement dies down.<br /><br />My bf says the after work crowd is denser and younger. But I saw that the weekend crowd is a nice mix of age groups and fitness levels. I liked it.<br /><br />Bring ear buds. All of the machines have music and/or TV boxes. We don&#039;t have cable so I really enjoyed the HGTV on my elliptical.

				I went by today in the afternoon and worked out. Long lines to sign up! <br /><br />It&#039;s very near Elmhurst hospital and lunchtime will likely be pretty crowded always. Even so, I had no trouble getting an elliptical. And time passed almost too quickly watching HGTV. <br /><br />For $15 bucks a month, I&#039;m a happy camper. I was paying $80 mo. in Carroll Gardens for not so well maintained equipment. I do miss the spin classes, but I&#039;ll be fine without.

				Forgive me for reviving a (near) dead old thread - but&nbsp; now that it&#039;s been open for a few months what are people&#039;s thoughts about Blink? I&#039;ve found the overcrowding to be a huge issue even during non-peak hours.

				I was initially excited to have a new, inexpensive gym nearby (despite reports of overcrowding) and assumed I’d be fine since I go during off-peak hours. Not so. I’ve never been to a gym before where no matter what time of day, nearly every weight machine is in use (and more often than not, being hogged by men, even though the clientele is pretty mixed gender). The last time I went at 3pm on a weekday, there wasn’t even a free treadmill –and there are a ton of treadmills. <br /><br />I live much closer to the supposedly horrible gym that used to be in the Blink space. I’m wondering if it’s really all that bad?<br />

				I go weekdays around 10am and it&#039;s not too crowded. Weekends I go on Sundays around 11 and it&#039;s ok. A lot of people are at church then.<br /><br />Yes there is always a guy sitting on the weight machine I want. :-)<br /><br />I just politely ask how many more reps he has and stand aside and wait if it&#039;s not too many or move on to my next machine if it is.<br /><br />My DH goes at night around 7:00 and he says it&#039;s jam packed at that time.

				I&#039;ve been going to Blink about 3x / week on average since it opened. It&#039;s not too crowded in the morning when I go (8:30 AM), but one thing I&#039;ve noticed:<br /><br />No matter what day I go, there is a core group of the same people that are always there. They are there when I arrive, and there when I leave. Thus, this group must be there for 2-3 hours or more EVERY DAY.<br /><br />Ideally, a gym wants lots of people to sign up but then not use their gym very much (they make it too crowded, wear out the machines, etc).&nbsp; The meatheads and gym rats that are there 3 hours every day really contribute to the congestion...at some point people will stop signing up because its too crowded.<br /><br />Note I&#039;m not saying there is anything wrong with these people spending so much time at the gym...they paid their membership fee.&nbsp; Just making an observation!

				Of course an inexpensive gym in an area without other gyms will be a bit crowded.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s not more crowded actually.&nbsp; For the price it&#039;s great.&nbsp; I&#039;ve paid more for other gyms in Manhattan an they were quite a bit worse in terms of space and machine availability, and they have gyms every couple blocks there.&nbsp; Blink definitely fits a need in the neighborhood and I&#039;m not aware of any reasonable alternative in the area that isn&#039;t a trek if you live somewhat near Blink.<br /><br />I think in any gym in NYC you probably have to be willing to adjust your workout depending on the availability of machines or be willing to wait for the one you want.

				Blink is definitely crowded - it&#039;s the only real gym in this area.&nbsp; Astoria, by contrast, has at least 6.&nbsp; I&#039;m actually thinking of quitting and just doing zumba classes which is all over Roosevelt these days.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t made up my mind yet though.

				The problem with Blink isn&#039;t that it&#039;s busy during the times you&#039;d expect it to be busy - after work hours - it&#039;s that it&#039;s *always* busy. And it&#039;s not a bit crowded, it&#039;s like insanely crowded. I&#039;ve tried mostly going at off-peak hours. It&#039;s busy then. At peak hours, it&#039;s nuts. They need to limit new memberships. It&#039;s actually really easy to do without flat out refusing to accept new members. You just raise the initiation fee to a level that discourages new members to join. Then when you have member atrophy, you drop the fee to encourage new members. <br /><br />And there&#039;s a lot of members who know nothing about gym etiquette, and the staff can really only do so much. Take note when you&#039;re there. There will be free weights just laying around the gym. Some of the members don&#039;t know (or don&#039;t care)&nbsp; that you&#039;re supposed to put free weights back on the racks. The people who work there can only do so much (and why should they have to lug around heavy free weights all day?). Part of the problem is also the folks who lounge around on the weight machines. You&#039;d think those lounging folks might notice others are waiting to use the machines, but if you don&#039;t ask to work in, most people won&#039;t offer. And unfortunately, some members have flat out refused my requests to work in. The worst part is, management&#039;s official response is &quot;we don&#039;t mandate that members share equipment or set time limits on the equipment.&quot; So, Blink is tots fine with setting up on the leg press for as long as it takes for as many sets as you plan to do -- whehter it&#039;s five minutes, 10, or 30, and refusing to let others work in a set.<br /><br />Executive Fitness is down on 87th Avenue and Roosevelt. It&#039;s way smaller, but does have a decent sized studio for stretching/abs.&nbsp; The AC isn&#039;t working there yet, though they have set up portables. Front desk says members are expected to let others work in on the weight machines. Anyone know anything about it?

				I joined this gym when they opened.&nbsp; I did not use it too much because of work, etc..&nbsp; Now that I am taking a break from working full-time, it has been terrific.&nbsp; It is close by, when I use the gym (before lunch) it&#039;s busy but there are plenty of cardio machines as well as weight machines.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use the free weights.&nbsp; <br />They have wipes available, so when you use the equipment you wipe-it-down when you are done, and move on..&nbsp; <br />The people who work there are very pleasant, and always greet you on the way in, and have a nice compliment on the way out the door. <br />I see many people using the services of a trainer, and they work with people from 17 to 70 years old.&nbsp; This is JH/Elmhurst and the clintele here reflect that.&nbsp; <br />The only issue I had was when my credit card was upgraded to a chip, and my auto-pay was screwed up.&nbsp; This was quickly resolved, and I try to go everyday if I can.&nbsp;
