				Toddle House, on 77th street near 37th avenue was, unequivocally, the best darn diner in the world. It started out as a Tenessee-based restaurant chain named Hull Dobbs, and was established in Jackson Heights abgout 1930.&nbsp; The building looked like a little cottage and specialized in fabulous hamburgers and waffles. Believe me, Toddle House was no proto McDonalds. It was open 24-7 and your meals were prepared (or choreographed, I should say) by ambidextrous short order cooks who made meals from scratch and could juggle ingredients faster than you&#039;d believe possible.&nbsp; You just sat at the counter on a low stool and watched the show unfold. Does anyone remember this late great place?

				I was introduced to hash browns there.&nbsp; It seems like a small thing, but to this day I still remember them.&nbsp; On a cold day we would get out of PS 69 and order them.&nbsp; Those were the days.

				Hash Browns, of course!&nbsp; The potatoes came in little white paper bags. They went into the pan with oil that flamed up like a 10 alarm fire. Next came a big shake of Paprika, and there it was -- the best potatoes ever for only .15.&nbsp; I still try to make Hash Browns the Toddle House way, but I never get it quite right.&nbsp;

				There was. The burger was delivered to your place at the counter via an electric train. It was novel but it didn&#039;t last too long -- probably because the Toddle House burgers were lots better.

				When I tell people about the Toddle House hash browns they look at me like I&#039;m nutz. They were the best ever. I too have tried to duplicate the recipe but it always comes short. I think it might have been the cooking oil they used I remember it was amber in color.&nbsp; Used to have a burger hash browns a &quot;lime rickey&quot; and a piece of cherry pie there for $1.25. Man talk about the good ol&#039; days
