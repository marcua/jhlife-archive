					My partner and I, both lifelong renters, are beginning to think about buying a place of our own. I&#039;m just getting started in learning about the homebuying process, and have also been poking around sites like trulia.com to get a better sense of what&#039;s attainable for around $200k. We&#039;d need a 2-bedroom and would love to stay in Jackson Heights; Kew Gardens is another possibility.<br />One thing I&#039;m wondering is what the typical down payment is for a co-op or condo in these areas. A lot of listings specify 20% down, which just isn&#039;t feasible for us (because the rent is too damn high!) Those of you who have recently bought a home, did you have to put down 20%? If not, how do you find places that will take 10% down or less? <br />Thanks for any tips-- I&#039;m just trying to get my bearings at this point.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />

					<br /><br />By SARAH MASLIN NIR<br />Published: June 7, 2012 <br /><br />The thief who snatched a taupe, buckle-covered bag from a young woman with a glossy black ponytail and designer sunglasses on Thursday afternoon in Queens might have thought it would be an easy crime. <br /><br />His well-dressed mark was strolling in Jackson Heights, on a bare and blighted pedestrian plaza near 37th Road, off Broadway, around 1:55 p.m. It seemed he could make a getaway through the thin crowd. <br /><br />He most likely did not expect the firefighter who came sprinting after him, throwing him off balance. Or the two strapping church missionaries, young men visiting from North Carolina, who hurtled into the fray and tackled him to the ground. <br /><br />But none of them counted on the purse snatcher having a gun. <br /><br />One missionary, Andre Aganbi, 19, a student at Duke University, had spent the day on the plaza with his church group peers from Durham, reading the Bible and chatting with passers-by about God. â€œWe were sitting right there, so I just jumped up, and as he tripped, I threw him to the ground,â€ he said. <br /><br />Mr. Aganbi, who pounced on the man along with Mark Haywood, 21, from the church group, said he had glimpsed something polished and brown in the pocket of the manâ€™s cargo pants. <br /><br />â€œHe started slowly reaching for his pocket,â€ Mr. Aganbi said. â€œBy the time I thought about it, he grabbed the gun, pointed it at someone who was behind him, lifted it up and shot it, and ran.â€ <br /><br />The police said on Thursday night that the suspect was still at large. <br /><br />The someone behind the gunman was a firefighter from Engine 287, who happened to be on the corner of the plaza and had sprinted with others after the man, his radio across his chest. <br /><br />The shot came so close, it left graze marks on the firefighterâ€™s shorts, said Richard Torres, a firefighter with Engine 287 who was also at the scene. The round hit a cellphone shop. <br /><br />Within 10 minutes, the police had roped off the area. On the trash-strewn plaza, which had been cleared of people, behind a barricade of yellow caution tape, a bullet hole and the shooterâ€™s navy baseball cap remained. <br /><br />And the young missionaries. <br /><br />Their arms around each other in a prayer circle, they stood by as their two friends were taken aside for questioning by detectives. With an almost eerie level of calm, each of the young people thanked the Lord. <br /><br />â€œIf anything had happened to Andre or Mark, they would be going to heaven, and they would be rejoicing with our Lord, because they trust in Christ so completely,â€ said Katharine Batchelor, 18, who was traveling with her peers on an eight-week mission from the Summit, a Southern Baptist church based in Raleigh, N.C. <br /><br />Her voice trembled. â€œItâ€™s just a beautiful thing,â€ she said. <br /><br />Local residents and shop owners were far less stoic. The plaza on which the shooting took place has been rife with controversy since the road was blocked off to create it late last year. It is the same area where a State Supreme Court justice, Thomas D. Raffaele, 69, said a police officer struck him after an unruly crowd surrounded the officer as he arrested a local vagrant. The episode is being investigated by the Police Departmentâ€™s Internal Affairs Bureau. <br /><br />Bystanders on Thursday were quick to blame the plaza, saying the reduced traffic had decimated businesses, with tables perpetually staked out by vagrants. <br /><br />â€œThe quality of the neighborhood has gone tremendously down,â€ said Agha Saleh, who owns the Internet cafe next to the shop that was struck. Last week, he said, a man stripped naked and ran into a nearby store. â€œRobberies, guns, drugs â€” so many things are happening every single day.â€ <br /><br />But the missionaries were still cheerful, even as some climbed into a patrol van for more questioning at the precinct. As they headed out, the two young men joked about the tense phone calls they would be making to their parents that night. <br /><br />â€œWhat did you do today?â€ Mr. Aganbi said, pantomiming the call. â€œHung out, chased some guy, almost got shot. Shared the Gospel.â€ <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/nyregion/a-thief-in-queens-is-thwarted-by-missionaries.html?ref=nyregion" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/nyregion/a-thief-in-queens-is-thwarted-by-missionaries.html?ref=nyregion</a><br /><br />

					How cool is this? From today&#039;s Queens Courier: <br /><br /><em>The Department of Parks and Recreation is currently constructing the Queens East River and North Shore Greenway, a 10.6-mile, urban, multi-use trail intended to provide access to the boroughâ€™s shoreline and improve commuting options for people beyond motorized vehicles. The bike and pedestrian pathway will connect Long Island City, Hunters Point, Ravenswood and Astoria with Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst. It will also unite five parks on the East River shoreline â€“ Astoria, Ralph DeMarco, Halletâ€™s, Queensbridge and Rainey parks.</em><br /><br /><a href="http://queenscourier.com/2012/western-queens-will-soon-be-more-bike-friendly/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queenscourier.com/2012/western-queens-will-soon-be-more-bike-friendly/</a><br /><br />Will make city biking much more appealing for those of us not brave enough to take on NYC motorists.

					The recent thread on Sky Foods reminded me of a latent ambition to learn more about Chinese and/or Indian cooking. Why not, with all these amazing sources of spices, exotic veggies and other ingredients all around?<br />Can you recommend your favorite cookbook that covers the fundamentals of these cuisines? I&#039;m not so much interested in the intense, takes-three-days-to-prepare kind of recipes. Rather, I&#039;d like to learn new dishes that are relatively simple and can be worked into your everyday routine.<br />Thanks all!

					Hi all,<br />Through my day job at a local nonprofit, I recently learned about the NY Youth Works program, which is sponsored by the NY Department of Labor. Businesses can earn up to $4000 in tax breaks for hiring youth through the program. The certification process is straightforward-- you can do it all here:<br /><br /><a href="https://labor.ny.gov/careerservices/youth-tax-credit.shtm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://labor.ny.gov/careerservices/youth-tax-credit.shtm</a><br /><br />So far, the only NYC businesses to get certified are McDonald&#039;s and a Cuban restaurant in Manhattan! This seems like a great opportunity that nobody knows about. So, if you&#039;re a local business owner and in need of full- or part-time help, consider checking this out. The tax breaks are only for youth who are hired on or before July 1, 2012.

					I&#039;ve been curious about this for a long time. Where do my Jackson Heights neighbors go for news?<br /><br />In my opinion this little neighborhood of 70,000 souls has fallen into a news gap. The big fish like the Times occasionally turn to us for stories on immigration, restaurants or real estate. The Queens papers cover elections and some community news, though they all seem to be spread thin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jacksonheightslife.com is a great place to chat and often functions as an informal news site. But I still think we&#039;re missing coverage of many important topics-- school board meetings, crime, business, transit &amp; traffic, not to mention investigations of the neighborhood&#039;s extensive underbelly. <br /><br />I dunno. What do you think?

					A few years ago a Bengali friend turned me on to the deliciousness that is the kati roll: a kind of Indian burrito, with cheese, potato or other fillings which are spiced, grilled and wrapped up in a roti. I&#039;ve noticed more places in the neighborhood are now selling them: Dosa Palace on 37th &amp; 73rd has a sign advertising its kati rolls, and right next door a new pizza joint also offers them.<br /><br />I intend to start sampling the local kati rolls post-haste. Anyone have a favorite?

					&quot;The Queens Library, one of the city&#039;s public libraries experiencing the budget squeeze, is taking an unprecedented step in its 104-year history and has stopped buying books.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/jan/20/new-books-we-dont-got-em-queens-library-halts-book-purchases/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/jan/20/new-books-we-dont-got-em-queens-library-halts-book-purchases/</a><br /><br />Of course this is a shame... at the same time, when I visit the Jackson Heights library branch I get the sense that this is not an organization that&#039;s innovative and deeply engaged with the community. When I take my kid to story hour I get the sense that the librarian is just doing the bare minimum to clock in her hours and collect her check. It&#039;s not the kind of service that inspires you to break out your checkbook.<br /><br />What do other members of this board think about our library branch? About the Queens Library system in general?<br /><br />

					Hello all,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to ask this group for a long time: how many of you live in buildings where the heat is kept uncomfortably high? My family lives in a 1930s-era apartment building in which the radiators turn off and on according to some centralized machine-- we don&#039;t even have the little knobs that you can use to adjust the level of heat coming from the floor unit. And it is often hotter &#039;n hell in here.<br /><br />Now, my husband tells me I just have warm blood because I&#039;m Irish and come from Boston. And it&#039;s true that when I was growing up my dad would turn the thermostat down to 55 degrees at night and we usually wore sweaters and thick socks to bed. But earlier this week when the weather was near freezing, I noticed lots of people in my building had their windows open, even on the top floors which supposedly are cooler. So I know it&#039;s not just me.<br /><br />It seems illogical, what with the cost of heating oil and the fact that so many people don&#039;t have enough heat and global warming and all that, that local landlords wouldn&#039;t want to save some $$ by better regulating their thermostats. So what do you think is going on? And is there anything that we, as tenants or as a neighborhood, can do to encourage heat to be distributed a bit more rationally?

					Something is brewing in the neighborhood... we were woken up twice last night by incidents near the corner of 35th Ave. and 75th St.<br /><br />The first incident was around 1:30 AM. I woke to the sound of running footsteps outside our window. &quot;He&#039;s over here,&quot; a man said. Soon there were sirens flashing. I heard an ambulance pull up. As I tried to fall back asleep, I heard an officer speaking to one of his colleagues, or perhaps into his radio. The snippet I caught was &quot;...bullet in the head and someone took a baseball bat to him.&quot; A little later my husband got up to look out the window. There was a &quot;Crime Scene Unit&quot; vehicle blocking the road, and men in suits-- homicide detectives.<br /><br />This morning there were still detectives around the crime scene. They now appear to be gone.<br /><br />The second incident was around 5 AM. &quot;I need a cop! I need a cop!&quot; someone was yelling. Turned out a drunk livery cab driver and had crashed his car into a street lamp. A passerby had grabbed his keys away and was trying to get help. Before we could dial 911, no fewer than four emergency vehicles pulled up-- fire trucks, police cruisers, an ambulance. The drunk driver was quickly cuffed and taken away.<br /><br />A disconcerting night, to be sure. I&#039;ve been looking for information on that first incident, what we assume was a homicide, but nothing so far.<br />

					Hi all,<br />Is there someplace nearby where can one purchase a local, free-range, no-antibiotic turkey? I have a sneaking suspicion this is something I should have figured out weeks ago. Still, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated by us last-minute Thanksgiving planners.
