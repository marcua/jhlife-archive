				As I sit in the toddler area today at travers park, huffing noxious fumes from the Mazda chop shop.&nbsp; I wonder, How did this happen?&nbsp; I forgot the story, but I remember they raced to build it before the park redesign was finished.&nbsp; But seriously how the hell did we allow this?&nbsp; &nbsp;Who dropped the ball?&nbsp; Dromm?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The chemical smell Iâ€™m assuming has to toxic?&nbsp; The little bit of street is essentially a showroom for Mazda.&nbsp; Car always illegal parked.&nbsp; Seems very shady and very mismanaged.&nbsp;

				Several years ago. most people objected to it, and a few very loud voices defended Koeppel and insisted, again and again, that it wouldn&#039;t be a problem. i&#039;m sure the posts are all still here. Dromm and others fought it, but money talks.

				The shop was there before the takeover of 78th St. It was Koeppel Toyota previously, or Koeppel Nissan. It is also the rear entrance to the Garden School where parents drop off their kids and the school parks it&#039;s vehicles. <br />Northern Blvd is pretty much one car long lot owned by Koeppel and Major Auto. I&#039;m not sure putting this one shop out of business would make much of a dent in the local air pollution, but you&#039;re free to complain. I suggest donating more to the politicians than the two auto dealers would be&nbsp; more productive, but feel free to complain if it makes you feel better.

				Picking up obvious chemical and paint odors while Having a chopshop that has an exhaust vent directly above a toddler playground is exactly the kind of thing people in the community&nbsp; should complain about.&nbsp; How could you not consider that an issue?&nbsp; Removing them would do wonders for the park.

				Yes. Many complained and hoped to extend Travis Park to Northern Boulevard, along 78th. <br /><br />But we lost that battle. <br /><br />The trick is to fight with big numbers before the deed is done. (Like before the renovation of the chopshop)<br /><br />It&#039;s a bit of a done deed after the cement has dried. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				As other say. We tried. We protested! We had rallies right on that block. Koeppel is very well connected. We failed.

				A &quot;chopshop&quot; is a place where stolen cars are disassembled so the untraceable parts can be sold. Is that what you meant? I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s just the service garage of a Mazda dealership. What kind of noxious fumes are we talking about?
