				Hi all,<br /><br />I am considering switching to Green Mountain Energy and was wondering if anyone has any experience with them. I am particularly interested to know how much their prices fluctuate, if there any any hidden fees, how easy it is to cancel and generally how helpful their customer service is. Of course, if you have any other relevant info, I&#039;d love to know. <br /><br />Thanks!

				I do not know anything about Green Mountain Energy, but my advice when it comes to these sort of issues is to stay away from any company not named Consolidated Edison. A lot of these alternative providers are scams. I personally know several elderly individuals that signed on the dotted line and were been fooled by them, one of whom paid insanely high rates for years.

				Green Mountain is just Wind Power energy. You can choose 100% Wind Power as your source via Con Edison. I think there was some negative discussion about GM a year or so ago. <br /><br />Try Googling them.<br /><br />I have Wind Power as my Con Ed choice and use the budget plan. No complaints and it has been at least 3 years. Hope that helps.<br />

				Since the only electricity coming&nbsp; into your house (business) is provided by Con Edison how are you getting their &quot;pollution free&quot; energy?

				Thanks, all, for your responses. <br /><br />ECG, is the name of your provider through ConEd simply WindPower? Do you happen to know what their rates are -- can&#039;t find the info online -- and how much they fluctuate?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				Sorry, probably shouldn&#039;t have capitalized the words. I can&#039;t tell if they fluctuate because I have the &#039;budget&#039; plan which means I pay the same rate winter and summer.<br /><br />Anyone out there know the answer?

				THANK YOU for posting this. <br /><br /><br />I have always wondered about this, and it&#039;s hard to find hard advice or actual numbers. <br /><br /><br />Without just dismissing the question, I would love to hear actual experiences with this. Ordinarily I would consider it ultra-shady, but the fact that they sell at the Green Market makes me think it&#039;s trustworthy. I doubt they would do business with a shady business, but maybe they legally have to. <br /><br /><br />What is up with this?<br /><br />

				We switched to Green Mountain about 18 months ago and are very happy with them.&nbsp; In fact, I can&#039;t really comment on customer service or anything else because I&#039;ve never had a reason to call them or deal with them.&nbsp; Everything has been exactly as they said it would be.<br /><br />There has been no change in the fluctuation of our bills.&nbsp; They do change a bit from month to month and tend to be higher in the summer, but that&#039;s as it always was and is to be expected based on usage.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t calculated the exact numbers, but my general sense is that our monthly bills may be slightly cheaper now than they were with regular Con Ed before the switch.<br /><br />I was quite skeptical too, especially because you hear the stories about the scammers who go door-to-door and trick people.&nbsp; I decided to give them a try though, in order to support renewable energy.&nbsp; I figured if it were a scam I could raise hell and spread the word.<br /><br />It hasn&#039;t been a scam at all.&nbsp; In our experience, it couldn&#039;t have been smoother or more uneventful.&nbsp; We made the switch and&nbsp; there was nothing else to think about.

				I&#039;ve had Green Mountain Energy for years and never had one complaint. I deal with Con Ed regarding any problems I&#039;ve ever had and have never had a reason to be in touch with Green Mountain. I understand that the energy coming into into my apartment is not directly from a wind farm, yet it makes me feel good to know that I&#039;m supporting renewable energy. I am on balance billing with Con Ed, so I really don&#039;t pay attention to minor fluctuations in it.

				Just a quick explainer: NY is a deregulated utility market, which means people can choose who *supplies* their energy. This can mean generation, but more often it means reselling from someone else. In NYC, ConEd still *distributes* your electricity (that is, sends it through the wires) but the electrons themselves come from someone else. Since ConEd owns the wires and meters they are also handling billing but that could change in a few years as customers become more familiar with Retail Electric Providers (REP). The idea is to create competition in the market. You can make up your own mind if this is a good thing. You can learn more about retail electricity at ConEd&#039;s website http://www.poweryourway.com/ -- in fact, if you move and call up ConEd to transfer service, they are legally required to offer you the chance to use an REP like Green Mountain Energy. I don&#039;t use GME personally, instead I buy 100% renewable power from EnergyPlus because they give me Frequent Flyer miles for every dollar I spend on the *supply* portion of my bill. They also have hotel and retail rewards programs if that&#039;s what you&#039;re interested in. The REP you select is totally up to you. The quality of the service should remain exactly as you have it now, no matter whose service you choose, because ConEd still owns and manages the wires that get the electricity to your home. You should shop around for the best rates for you. Most REPs offer the option to buy 100% renewable power (including ConEd) so you should consider shopping around for other perks as well.
