				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My husband and I rescued a stray kitten in early March, when it was cold and wet outside.&nbsp; On a freezing night the kitten saw us through a window and meowed, so we began to leave food + water out, in hopes that we could rescue him.&nbsp; After putting out food for him just a few times, he happily came into our house, glad to have a warm + dry place w/ food and fresh water! <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He has a *fantastic* personality.&nbsp; He&#039;s friendly, affectionate, easy going, playful- extra amazing considering the rough time he must have had as a stray.&nbsp; He loves being brushed and + used the litter box right away w/ no accidents.&nbsp; He is docile and patient when his claws get trimmed.&nbsp; He greets us and loves being petted and held but doesn&#039;t fuss about being alone either.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have had him checked out by a vet + got him neutered + up to date with all vaccinations.&nbsp; He is a healthy 1 1/2 year old neutered male, super cute, w/ four white feet, a white snout and a little pink nose.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We would keep him but we have 2 other cats and they fight when together.&nbsp; We have a hunch that this rescued kitty (who we&#039;ve been calling &quot;Lucky&quot;) should be the only cat in a household.&nbsp; He may have problems getting along with other cats but he is great with adults and children.&nbsp; We are having a baby in a few months and it is hard for us to keep the cats quarantined from each other while moving furniture and getting a baby&#039;s room ready.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lucky was fostered for a couple months this summer by a couple who had to move and was unable to bring any pet to their new apartment.&nbsp; We want to make sure his next home is a permanent, loving home- he deserves it!<br /><br />We could not sing his praises enough- the only thing stopping us from keeping him is the fighting with our other pets.&nbsp; He is soooo good and loving we can&#039;t beart to bring him to a shelter.&nbsp; I am not sure how many pictures came through, please email me and I will send more.<br /><br />
