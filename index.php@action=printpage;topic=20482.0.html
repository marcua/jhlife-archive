				I live on 80th St. and I haven&#039;t slept through the night for at least a year. Trucks start roaring past my window as early as 5 in the morning, screeching on their breaks as they reach the speed bump, crashing over the speedbump, and then roaring as they step on the gas again. Then there are the constant bumper-to-bumper traffic jams that happen every single day. I feel like I live on a highway instead of a one-lane, one-way residential street that leads to nothing important and connects absolutely no major corridors.<br /><br />Are other streets in the neighborhood this bad and I just don&#039;t know it because I don&#039;t live on them? Has it gotten worse since the pandemic? I just can&#039;t for the life of me imagine why every truck in the entire borough chooses THIS specific street to go down. In fact, it&#039;s probably what will eventually drive me to move away, and it really saddens me.

I live on 35th Avenue and it is much worse. All traffic gets slowed by double parked delivery trucks on 35th avenue every day, resulting in more noise, honked horns.<br /><br />Also, sometimes GPS directs traffic onto small streets to avoid a one minute delay on other streets. Maybe your street is preferred by GPS. 80th street goes right to Elmhurst Hospital, maybe they are deliveries to that.

				As a cyclist, I have noticed many more cars on the roads since the pandemic hit.&nbsp; I agree that the traffic jams seem worse as well......and the honking is insane.&nbsp; But perhaps, I&#039;m only noticing this more now because I am no longer going into the city most days.&nbsp;

				I have a theory: It might be because your block is the first one that is southbound from Northern, beyond that closed 78th st area at Traverse park. Driving a truck (as is a car) west to east on 37th ave in the 70&#039;s is a total nightmare, with all that double parking from the shops there. So the trucks are sliding past that on Northern and crossing over to 37th or Roosevelt on 80th st.<br /><br />What kills me is how this city permits enormous 16 wheel semi trucks to make deliveries to say, that tiny Dunkin Donuts on 37th Ave. The whole shop can fit in that truck. We let these big corporations kill our neighborhood because their bottom line is more important than our quality of life.<br /><br />I am kinda sick of everyone scapegoating the open streets. This area is so lacking in public open spaces, it&#039;s ridiculous. 34th Ave being open is clearly filling a very important need in our community. And I say that as a car owner.

But you&#039;d think the trucks delivering to the 70s on 37th Avenue would drive down an earlier sidestreet, ditto the trucks delivering to the 80s going down a higher one. Like, wouldn&#039;t ever truck just drive Northern until it reached the numbered street closest to its delivery point?<br /><br />In any case, I agree with you Open Streets probably has nothing to do with this.

				Haven&#039;t slept through the night in at least a year? A year ago there was almost no truck traffic and very little traffic of any kind. It was probably the quietest this neighborhood has ever been since it was developed. <br />Our residential side streets happen to be in a densely populated neighborhood with more than one thriving commercial corridor, and is a destination for many, particularly for our restaurants and food trucks. <br />

				Acknowledging that traffic is much more dense on 35th Avenue than it was before 34th was closed (my direct experience living with many windows onto 35th Avenue) is not scape-goating, it is just that, recognizing a fact.&nbsp; But likewise, 37th Avenue is much more dense.&nbsp; People who used to take public transit are driving more.

				<br />For sure the closing of traffic on 34th Avenue has created more on 37th and 35th, <em>especially on 35th<em></em></em> since the chances of any movement there are better than 37th. <br /><br />Take a look at my name. My building stands on 35th from 75th to 76th. I did agree with the closing of 78th to add onto Travers Park. It did make sense. You know what we got? They turned 75th from northbound to southbound as a trade off. Now 75th is a southbound highway. What was a nice <em>quiet<em></em></em> residential street is now a 24 access for every truck, bus, siren and boom box car, not to mention other traffic with it&#039;s noise and pollution. Now it&#039;s 35th Avenue as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately the boundary line of the historic district officially stops right before my intersection. If you are not in the district no one hears anything. Meanwhile everyone on 34th smiles.... no traffic on a street that doesn&#039;t get enough use to warrant the closure. While people keep up &quot;quality of life&quot; issues such as this they really mean their own, not yours. <br /><br />And I can say having the new 34th Avenue Mall recently meant a perfect place for people to congregate and gawk at the 89 Street fire. That brought enterprising food and beverage carts for the gawking convenience. Recreational entertainment? Maybe we should ask about Port-O-Sans on every 34 Avenue corner to also accommodate the Mall. <br /><br />The bottom line is that as long as there is apathy concerning the district lines ultimately the whole neighborhood suffers. We keep seeing all the issues that the district rails against encroaching further and further. Other parts of 35th are in the district - do they not agree?

				For those pushing the 34th Avenue agenda, it seems it&#039;s all or nothing.&nbsp; I have questioned the need to have the open streets every day of the year.&nbsp; I enjoy using 34th avenue to bike, walk to farmer&#039;s market on Sundays--but often, even in nice weather it is not always that crowded and there is plenty of room to walk the dog, push a stroller, etc. on the sidewalk.&nbsp; The bike lane works fine, as long as cars and people don&#039;t stand in the lane. Traffic and congestion on 35th Avenue is worst during the weekday afternoon rush hour, and as schools open and more people start commuting will be a problem in the morning rush as well.&nbsp; Many cities close streets on weekends, perhaps a real study needs to be done to look at the hours to keep the street open with consideration for the impact to traffic on other streets in the neighborhood.

If you have a completely empty street with two trucks double parked across from each other -- no problem, it doesn&#039;t impact anything. Two double parked trucks with moderate traffic (like pre-Covid) then it&#039;s a moderate problem. Two double parked trucks with heavy traffic (as it is now with 34th closed), then it&#039;s a large problem, at least for those who live on 35th Ave and have to listen to the honking, and for those who drive or take the bus on 35th and now have a longer, more frustrating commute.

				Traffic, overall on 35th Ave it seems to be worse.&nbsp; Also on 80th Street -where we reside. <br />On 80th Street between 37th Ave &amp; 35th Ave there are now two curbside areas where delivery trucks can stop for short periods of time.&nbsp; It looks to be working as hoped. <br />My fear is that when the almost weekly parades restart on 37th Ave, there will be total gridlock.&nbsp; <br />I also believe that because of the pandemic, many people utilize their cars to avoid buses &amp; subways..&nbsp;

				&nbsp;I think what people are commenting on is the fact that no allowances were made when one major artery of Jackson Heights vehicular traffic was closed and it has clogged the surrounding streets. Who did the planning and can they explain the concept here? Otherwise, a number of people are suggesting we need to go back to the drawing board and look at this closure post-pandemic and consider all the elements that it affects. Where did the 34th Ave traffic migrate too? Residents and businesses adversely effected are entitled to their voice and if Open Streets can work better for all, why not look<br />at new plans?

I use Uber now.&nbsp; I may be in debtors prison soon.<br /><br />Half of the available avenues in the residential area of JH are now blocked to traffic.&nbsp; This is not an ideal situation for traffic.&nbsp; It seems to suit people who do not like running on the sidewalk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, and I realize no one cares, 37 th ave would be a better pedestrian street.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alternatively, if we took one half of 34 th ave and made it pedestrian and the other half a one way street with 35th avenue as a one way street going the other way, I think that would be a good compromise.&nbsp;
