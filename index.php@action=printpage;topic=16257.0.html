				I am looking for a Polish man who was bartending in 1969 and was known as Richard. He was of Jewish descent although I don&#039;t know if he considered himself Jewish. <br />

Maybe people would remember a Polish/Jewish bartender..?<br />

				Do you know what bar? That would be helpful. I grew up in JH and left in 1971, but came back often
