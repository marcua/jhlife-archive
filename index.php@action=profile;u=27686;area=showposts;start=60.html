					I just came back from foodtown.&nbsp; It&#039;s very crowded. The line was not too long if you used the basket rather than the shopping cart, which would make it&nbsp; difficult for you to reach the self-check out line. <br /><br />The same thing as observed as dssh, many people were doing shopping, but not buying tons of stuff. I think none of them were taking this snow storm seriously.&nbsp; Since most families were off this afternoon and tomorrow, it makes sense to buy something to make a nice meal for today and tomorrow as there is nothing to do anyway.

The air train costs much less than taxi (air porter), is much reliable and is not subject to traffic.<br /><br />In terms of saving time for the travellers to LGA. The best way to follow the Q70 bus (it connects the five subway lines at Jackson Heights, including both local and express 7&nbsp; and LIRR at woodside). The next best thing is to connect the Astoria N to LGA. The air train that&nbsp; connects Willet points to LGA&nbsp; will not be utilized much, but better than nothing at all.<br /><br />However, the cost of building air train for the three strategies is the other way around, that is probably why the air train from Willet points to LGA was proposed.

Many coops in Jackson Heights probably like mine, there is a bike storage in the basement. When I was renting before I purchased my current coop in Jackson Heights and there was no bike storage in the basement, I sort of made a bike hanger so that I mounted the bike vertically on the wall of the corner to save the space, something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saris-Bike-Trac-Storage-1-Bike/dp/B0029LF0BC" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Saris-Bike-Trac-Storage-1-Bike/dp/B0029LF0BC</a>.

					I used to have my own bike and visited many places in the city by bike long before Citibike time. Now with kids to raise, I do not get the chance to bike much. <br /><br />I&#039;m not really understanding the benefits of the citibike station for the <strong>local residents</strong> in our neighborhood. If you really want to bike, just buy one bike (a cheap one is probably around $100) and a good lock so that you can go anywhere you want without having to worry returning the bike to a citibike station or other stuffs.<br /><br />A better way to benefit for the local bikers in Jackson Heights will be more bike lanes and more bike parking.<br /><br />Yeah, I understand the emotion behind that Astoria is going to have it, so Jackson Heights should have the citibike too. <br /><br />Citikbike can bring tourists (or people from Brooklyn and Manhattan) to this neighborhood and hence to increase the awareness of this neighborhood and then a higher price for the real estate.&nbsp; Is this another motivation behind this?<br /><br />

I guess it could be easily reconfigured as two units of three bedroom apartments in terms of space by adding a kitchen on the top floor, but not sure of the local zoning laws.<br /><br />There was a mentioning on this site that the record price for a single family home in Jackson Heights is about 1 million dollars probably during the pre-2008 housing bubble. Here is link (<a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/50/jaxheightshome_tl__2013_13_q.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/50/jaxheightshome_tl__2013_13_q.html</a>) for a house on the same 86th st that was sold for near 1 million dollars recently.

My initial search found that the house was on Market on July 2014 as mentioned by the agent armen and by the date of first post of the other thread about this property.<br /><br />The agent for the house was not honest on the square feet of the house. As poster pr56 said, 4000 sq feet is only for the lot, the building area is about 2600 sq feet from my initial search (i&#039;m not sure if the basement was counted in this number).&nbsp; <br /><br />As mentioned in the other thread, the price for this home is definitely over priced, but whether the house can be sold at this price really depends on how long the agent is able to find a sucker from Brooklyn or one of your favorite overpriced neighborhoods.

					The other thread about the rental for this building inspired me to look into the building and found out the correct name for this building should be Yin Hu tower (not as Vin Chu tower as mentioned in the other thread <a href="index.php@topic=8373.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8373.0</a>).<br /><br />&nbsp;For about 27 condo Units (floor 2 to floor 4), six units has already been sold since Oct 2014. See the attached for the sale history. found from the the public record. The sales for the apartment for this building seem to be doing OK.

					By looking at the Webtrak of the plane noise (<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/airports/webtrak.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.panynj.gov/airports/webtrak.html</a>). In Jackson Heights, at least for me, it will never be a good idea to live around the flight path (just imagine a line connecting 61st street/Roosevelt ave to the north-south runway of LGA). If you are waiting the 7 train on the platform of the woodside-61st 7 subway station, very often you can literally see the plane just flying above your head directly.<br /><br />Due to the expensive real estate of NYC, whatever properties on the market will always sell as some people will have to sacrifice what ever they don&#039;t like for a lower price or for a shorter commute or for a large space. <br /><br />
