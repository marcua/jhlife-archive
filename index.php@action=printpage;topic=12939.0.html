				Of course, the shops on the affected block are closed.&nbsp; I&#039;m unsure how this will affect the businesses in the long-term.&nbsp; Also, I would imagine there&#039;s significant water damage to the surrounding apartments.<br /><br />(http://i776.photobucket.com/albums/yy43/JacksonHtsLife/IMG_9398_zps3adc2931.jpg) (http://s776.photobucket.com/user/JacksonHtsLife/media/IMG_9398_zps3adc2931.jpg.html)

				It would be interesting to notice that all recent fires in Jackson Heights happened at the 37th ave as far as I know, none in the side street area. <br /><br />The previous two fires have paid the landlords handsomely. A new condo building (84th st and 37th Ave) is built after the fire.&nbsp; The rebuilt Brunson building (37th ave and 74th st) after the fire will attract higher rents.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if this new fire (whether intentional or not) will result in a new condo building or a rebuilt building. In one way or the other, some low rent paying tenants have to move out.&nbsp;

I asked a 37th Ave. bldg super abt allowing a fire to occur (not setting it per se, but letting the boiler run when in need of repair for instance). He didn&#039;t seem to think that that has been the case, but I still have my nagging doubts. <br /><br />BTW, there was a fatal fire on 34th in the 80s abt 4 months ago, and it was legit, caused by the tenant.

I&#039;m guessing the fire on 34th ave and 85th st didn&#039;t cause much damage to the building so no kicking out tenants would be necessary or be legal. The fire on 34th ave and 85th st started from the tenant&#039;s kitchen, so it had nothing to do with the landlord.<br /><br />The fires on 37th ave always caused much <strong>serious damages</strong> to the building and the tenants had to move out.&nbsp; But there were always <strong>zero people</strong> getting seriously hurt for the 37th ave fires and the cause of these 37th ave fires were never convincing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess a single death will result much thorough investigation that no landlord want to face.<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12939.msg61401.html#msg61401">Quote from: Marlene on February 13, 2015, 09:40:59 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I can&#039;t believe that the Joseph Bruno Trust (owners of the Bruson building) also own the building where there was a fire last night at 35-64 81st Street.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow. Let&#039;s see how much effort can be put into the investigation of the cause of fire.&nbsp; As I said above, with no singe person got seriously hurt, there were much less incentive for the investigation. To press a thorough investigations, it would require serious efforts (monetarily and emotionally and legally) and would probably a full time job itself.
