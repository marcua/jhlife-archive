				Great ARTIST/CREATIVE Studios, NEWLY RENOVATED, 1 block R/G/V Trains (55th st. between 37th / Bway, Woodside)<br />Reply to: comm-whfz5-1243822099@craigslist.org [Errors when replying to ads?]<br />Date: 2009-06-28, 1:25PM EDT<br /><br /><br />FANTASTIC ARTIST STUDIO / CREATIVE SPACES Available July 1.<br /><br />NEWLY RENOVATED by landlord to our specifications. 9&#039;3&quot; ceilings, skylights in each studio, very private fully enclosed. Great ventilation, plenty of power outlets. Small building with only 10 studios total- your neighbors are professional artists, academics, designers, composers etc. Space is run by artist / musician couple, not a corporate development company. Looking for QUALITY tenants to make a very nice environment / community. Super clean, totally brand new space!<br /><br />Located 33-55th St. in Woodside, Queens, 1 block from Northern Blvd. R/G/V trains, 15 min walk to Roosevelt Ave. E/F/G/R/V/7 Trains (straight down Broadway, very easy, or just take the R/V train 2 stops to Northern Blvd station). SUPER convenient to Jackson Heights, Sunnyside, Elmhurst, LIC (even Manhattan / Brooklyn depending on what train you use; E/F are express, 15 min. to Midtown!) Very close to BQE at Northern Blvd as well.<br /><br />Common area includes 2 slop sinks, SHOWER, cabinets, counter space. ALL EXPENSES INCLUDED IN RENT: Heat, Water, Electricity, CENTRAL A/C, WiFi, Trash, Insurance. 24/7 access. Very Reasonable Price!<br /><br />ONLY 2 SPACES LEFT. THE STUDIO IS UNDER RENOVATION, so no current Pictures- but can easily arrange a viewing of the property at any time. Email me to set up a time. Landlord is making great progress on the work, it is starting to look awesome.<br /><br />- Studio 3= 225 sq ft + CA + ALL Expenses = $460<br /><br />- Studio 4= 180 sq ft + CA + ALL Expenses = $385<br /><br />These rooms could work well as a shared space between 2 artists with different schedules.<br /><br />
