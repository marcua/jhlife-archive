				You could talk to some of the store owners or workers on 37th Road, or at the barber shop down the stairs, to find out more about him.&nbsp; He used to sit outside that barber shop every day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think someone around there must take some care of him in some way, but in any case I&#039;m sure there&#039;s something you can do to help if you ask around.&nbsp;

				I see the homeless Indian man every day, and I also feel terrible for him.&nbsp; I too would like to do something to help this man, but it&#039;s difficult to know how to help without first understanding the nature and extent of his problem.&nbsp; I would be grateful to anybody who would like to research with the neighbors and post the answers to this thread. Perhaps we can devise a way to help him together.

				He has been there for about ten years. I don&#039;t think there is much anyone can do for him.
