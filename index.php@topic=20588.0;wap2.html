			Hi All! Does anyone have a recommendation for a house keeper that they know of? I’m looking for someone to come once a week for a few hours for basic cleaning/laundry. <br /><br />Our laundry is a shared one in the building and we also host a nannyshare during the week so if anyone has any tips for managing around that (or even just pay expectations in general), I would take the advice.
