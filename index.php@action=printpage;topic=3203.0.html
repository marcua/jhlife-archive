				Another plug for Gleason paints, there is also a decent store at roosevelt and 73rd-- I try my best to use these local guys as opposed to going to the Depot, but sometimes, ya gotta go there.

				Gleason&#039;s is the best! Also excellent, though mostly for paint is Kazalas on 37th avenue and 89th or 90th.

				I have to buy a deadbolt for my new apartment and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen any hardware stores in the area (I&#039;m near 74th St). &nbsp;Anybody know of a good hardware store? &nbsp;I can go to Home Depot too, but thought I might be able to get more advice at a hardware store.<br />While I&#039;m asking questions, are there any particular deadbolt brands/types that are recommended?<br />thanks.<br /><br /><br /><strong><em>Moderator note:&nbsp; Similar topics merged</em>.</strong>

				There&#039;s a locksmith shop located on the south side of 37th Avenue between 78th and 79th Streets (or approx.) &nbsp;I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;d be able to advise you on a good deadbolt.

				It&#039;s 2 doors down from 79th<br />http://bit.ly/dZR5Ll<br /><br />Makes sense to park your business&#039; truck out from with your business name and phone number prominently displayed when the google map truck drives by!<br /><br />edited: I am not sure why the link isn&#039;t linking to the google map but in the google streetview, you can see the Joseph Lock truck parked out in front with the phone number printed quite large.

				Archers on Roosevelt and 74th St has been around for a very long time, I also<br />go to Broadway Hardware 80-19 Broadway, next to the Elmhurst P.O.<br /><br />Builders hardware supply on the south side of Queens Blvd(80-02 51st ave) is<br />another place that I go to. They used to be on 76th St, near the north side of<br />QB. One of the workers is mute but he is very helpful and knowledgeable with<br />a very positive attitude.

				Do you guys really consider Gleason to be a hardware store?&nbsp; They really don&#039;t have that much outside of paint supplies that I&#039;ve noticed (I go there a lot and love it).&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen door knobs or the like there.&nbsp; <br /><br />I always try the place on Roosevelt and 74th before I give up and hike up to Home Depot.&nbsp; They have an ok amount of stuff for such a small space.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will never step foot in Kazalas paint again.&nbsp; I decided to try them instead of Gleason once and the men there were so rude to me - I wanted to buy a lot of paint and the guy refused to believe that I wanted oil instead of latex and actually told me I should call my husband to check because he was so sure I was wrong.&nbsp; I know how to paint, I know what I needed, I&#039;m not married and I dropped the brushes I was also going to buy on the floor and walked out of their misogynist store and took a cab to Gleason&#039;s where they don&#039;t treat me like a &quot;clueless broad.&quot;

				Sam&#039;s Hardware on the north side of Roosevelt(64-07) has a large selection for such a small<br />store. Home Depot is always my last option for the small stuff.

				<br />Long Island Janitor Supply<br /><br /><br />Many moons ago they were on the opposite side of Roosevelt in a store that took up nearly half the block. They even sold kitchen appliances then, not to mention who knows what...<br />but the lights were more off than on. So with the dark, the dust, and creaky old wood floors you had lots of ambiance... and a great selection!

				I remember that place that used to be on the other side of Rosie, as a kid I went there a few times after we<br />accidently broke windows while playing ball in the street. I figured they went out of business, I didn&#039;t even<br />realize that they moved across the street.
