				I&#039;m a 7th grade teacher at I.S. 145.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing a Landscape Architecture enrichment activity with some of my students.&nbsp; We are planning to do some landscaping in front of I.S. 145 along 34th Avenue (between 79th and 80th).&nbsp; I have a few questions for the community:<br /><br />1. This Friday morning my co-teacher I are taking the students on a walk of the neighborhood to look at how gardens are set up.&nbsp; Which gardens should the kids see?&nbsp; Which are most beautiful? Most unique?&nbsp; Is there anyone out there that can help us get inside some of the inner gardens?<br /><br />2. I&#039;m looking for landscape architecture professionals/experts that could come in and talk to the kids and organizations.<br /><br />3. I&#039;d love to find some money for basic supplies (tools, plants, mulch, etc.).<br />

				Sounds like a great project!&nbsp; I would recommend contacting the Jackson Heights Beautification Group (718-565-5344, info@jhbg.org).&nbsp; They most likely have a number of members with expertise in the gardens of the neighborhood, and knowledge of who to contact to access them.&nbsp;

				Are you going to be working on the median or in front of the school?

				The Chateau, on the south side of 34th Avenue between 80th and 81st streets, has probably the most elaborate and beautiful of the private gardens. In contrast, the garden at the Towers, across 34th Avenue from the Chateau, is simpler but also more elegant, with its long, shady vistas and architectural features, as well as being wonderfully serene. <br /><br />Unfortunately, however, no garden looks its best at this time of year.<br />

				We are planning to work in front of the school (not the median) when the scaffolding comes down.&nbsp; Eventually, we will expand to the 80th and 79th street sides.

				Interested in gardens - JH is the place to be.&nbsp; Most all the co-op&#039;s take enormous pride in our gardens. You will not be disappointed.&nbsp;

				Call St. Mark&#039;s Church on 34th between 82nd &amp; 81st. They have three gardens. One is always open and the others would require an appointment but that should be no big deal. You can reach them at 718-639-8893. <br /><br />Email me privately if you want more information.<br /><br />Betsy
