					Our apartment has 8 rooms and 2 baths.&nbsp; We removed the heater from the kitchen, leave the heater in one of the guest bedrooms off, leave the heat in the dining room and the 2nd guest bedroom on, turn off the heat in the living room, leave the heat on in the family room and both bathrooms and leave open windows in the master bedroom and in the living room.&nbsp; It&#039;s still hot, and every now and then we open the window in the family room to cool the place down, but it&#039;s easier to cool the apartment down than to heat it, so we don&#039;t complain.

					I&#039;ll defend them somewhat.&nbsp; I have a home in upstate NY that is on the corner of a block near Main Street.&nbsp; Quite often, campaigns place their signs on that corner, in the grass, in a part of the corner that is public property, but that is directly in front of my home - the only home visible from the street.&nbsp; Over the years, I have taken down every single sign put up by Republican politicians as I view this as a campaign sending a message that my home is voting for, and supporting, their candidate.&nbsp; One time, I caught a campaign staffer attempting to place a sign and told him not to place it there because I&#039;ll throw it away.&nbsp; He obliged, got in his car, and went two homes down the road.&nbsp; That homeowner also removed the sign.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, someone actually sued for this right, and the Court agreed that placing a sign in front of a home violates the First Amendment as it has the net effect of impugning political speech on you.&nbsp; So maybe the people complaining were doing so because they were not Nixon supporters, and did not wish to have an advertisement in front of their building giving people the impression that they are.

					I had Verizon for years until I moved to JH.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t get a signal anywhere in my building, and never in my apartment.&nbsp; I called customer service, and they said they were looking into additional antennas, but that they had no date set in stone for their installation.&nbsp; One of the local cell phone shops was kind enough to give me a few cell phones from various carriers to bring to my apartment to test them out, and two of the carriers had a signal.&nbsp; I picked AT&amp;T as they have great coverage in upstate NY whereas, at the time, other carriers did not.&nbsp; I still only get a bar or two, but it does work, and now with the wifi calling feature on my iphone, so long as I get any signal at all, I can use my phone without any issues.

					Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather die than vote for anyone that supports Monserrate.&nbsp; He betrayed the trust of every single resident by stealing money from us, and he betrayed my trust personally by joining the Republicans (just like Peralta) and by voting against marriage equality.&nbsp; Screw him.&nbsp; At least now I know who they are.

					Became a PF global member because we go upstate most weekends and there&#039;s a PF up there that we go to.&nbsp; The upstate PF is amazing -- super clean, new machines, all in great shape, about 10 tanning rooms with different machines, a couple of massage chairs, a UV room, etc.&nbsp; The one by us is more limited, but I only use it when I want to do some cardio and I don&#039;t want to travel to Equinox in the city so I only go downstairs to the weight area to change in the locker room if it&#039;s winter.<br /><br />The downstairs weight area looks small and is pretty much always crowded.&nbsp; I find it less appealing than the Blink in our area because it has zero natural light and the air circulation isn&#039;t that great.&nbsp; The upstairs cardio area is great, with a ton of machines, but upkeep is an issue.&nbsp; Many TV&#039;s on the machines don&#039;t work anymore, some need to be oiled and adjusted and there are signs that the machines are fraying.&nbsp; They need better maintenance.<br /><br />On the plus side, it&#039;s always clean, the locker room is big and I never had a problem finding a locker.&nbsp; If you mainly do cardio, this gym is pretty good.&nbsp; The people that work out here clean the machines after working out and are friendly.&nbsp; If you occasionally do weights, then I&#039;d say you can make due here.&nbsp; If you want to focus on weights, find another gym (not Blink either).<br /><br />All in all, it&#039;s a good gym, especially for the price.&nbsp; Become a black card member and you can use any PF anywhere.&nbsp; The PF&#039;s outside the city are amazing, since I&#039;ve been to quite a few.<br />

					Our building is pretty no frills, but we have a live-in super, free incredibly large storage rooms in the basement (I mean, the size of a Manhattan hotel room) and some back yard space with seating and a grill (although on concrete).&nbsp; If it had parking, it would be perfect, but alas.

					A few of things:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Co-ops are not required to give a reason for rejecting someone, and I know of none that do;<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Most Co-ops in the neighborhood do not permit subletting, and having children purchase an apartment for their parent, who will reside in the apartment, would be considered a sublet;<br /><br />3.&nbsp; While most Co-ops permit parents purchasing an apartment for their children (mine does not), the application typically lists only the children as shareholders, with the parents putting up the purchase money.&nbsp; The Board then looks to see if the kids are able to afford the maintenance on their own -- without the parents&#039; help.&nbsp; This may be difficult in the case of your mother.&nbsp; <br /><br />4.&nbsp; While a Co-op cannot discriminate based on age or source of income, the Board can decide that the arrangement proposed -- having all the kids act as guarantors -- is objectionable where the actual resident is unable to afford the maintenance.<br /><br />It will be difficult to buy a cooperative apartment in the manner that you have proposed.&nbsp; I know that condominiums are more expensive, but that may very well be your best bet.&nbsp; Plus - if the apartment becomes vacant for any reason in a down market, you will be able to rent a condominium unit until the market swings back up, whereas you may be stuck with either a loss or years of carry charges for an unoccupied cooperative that does not permit sublets.<br /><br />Last thought - have a well-funded trust created for your mother&#039;s benefit purchase the apartment.&nbsp; The trust will be the shareholder and your mother will sign an occupancy agreement to occupy the apartment.&nbsp; Manhattan buildings have been permitting this arrangement more and more, but not sure about this neighborhood.<br /><br />Good luck and let us know what happens.

					34th Avenue - well, at least that&#039;s far enough from the main commercial strip that it won&#039;t impact businesses.&nbsp; Plus, those areas are mostly single family, as opposed to the buildings between 35th and 37th.

					I read some of the comments on this in another forum and they made me sad.&nbsp; It&#039;s a house of worship.&nbsp; The same people that were complaining about it would have no problem with a Catholic Church opening at that location.&nbsp; Pure discriminatory animus.<br /><br />The only comment that I gave credit to was to the person who lives next door.&nbsp; He complains that congregants constantly block his driveway, and that the Mosque does nothing to stop it, so he did not support a larger Mosque because that would mean more headaches for him.&nbsp; This rings true, and as neighbors, the Mosque should make sure that he is not inconvenienced by people blocking him.
