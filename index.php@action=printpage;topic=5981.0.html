				This article is from 1997.&nbsp; I just stumbled across it.&nbsp; Does anyone remember this?<br /><br />Captive in Queens (http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E3D6153BF932A15754C0A961958260)<br /><br />&quot;Seven Mexican immigrants were arrested yesterday on charges of running a smuggling ring that sneaked scores of deaf Mexicans across the border, stashed them in safe houses in California, flew them to New York City and forced them, under threat of beatings, to work as trinket vendors in the subways. <br /><br />An eighth suspect, Reinaldo Paoletti, who is considered the ringleader, is still at large and the authorities are searching for him in the United States and Mexico. Four of those arrested are also members of the Paoletti family, who kept a tyrannical reign over two apartments crowded with deaf Mexicans in Jackson Heights, Queens, officials said. <br /><br />Yesterday morning, 57 of the Mexicans, including 3 pregnant women and 12 young children, ate waffles at the Westway Motor Inn in Elmhurst, Queens...&quot;<br /><br />click link above for rest of article<br />

				Yes, a number of the victims were flower sellers on 37th Avenue.<br /><br />Was shocking at the time. <br /><br />Is there any improvement in the people smuggling/exploitation now? I don&#039;t mean that sarcastically, I just haven&#039;t been following that thread of news recently.

				I remember the incident and believe it happened on 93rd Street, between Elmhurst and Roosevelt Avenues. The reason I remember is that I grew up on that block.<br />
