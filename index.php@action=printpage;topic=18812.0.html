				Whats yours? Always looking for a quick smallish portion for late breakfast, lunch, first dinner and/or second dinner (besides pizza or deli sandwiches)<br /><br />Currently mine is at Papa&#039;s Kitchen (83rd and 37th). Strange that the menu I found online doesn&#039;t include the Silogs.&nbsp; They are 7 and 8 dollar plates with a big scoop of garlic fried rice (could be a little more garlicky for my taste) but its not greasy like the fried rice at the chinese take-out places.&nbsp; The rice is topped with a perfectly cooked overeasy egg and your choice of viande . They&#039;re all good but I highly recommend the longanisa, a sweet and garlicky sausage.&nbsp; Thats the guilty pleasure right there.&nbsp; Woodside has a few places that serve this and have grilled sardines as an option.&nbsp; Hopefully Papas Kitchen can add this option.<br /><br />Pretty high on the list <strong><em>was</em></strong> the falafel pitas, and the shakshouka at Zaytouns.&nbsp; Tried to make the hike across Roosevelt at least once a week.&nbsp; Best falafel I&#039;ve had this side of the mediteranean.&nbsp; So sad they are gone.&nbsp; Does anyone have any recommendations for a place with similar dishes nearby?<br />

				the small combo plate at Rabjhog is very good- two veg, rice or bread and dal. 8.95 adds a small app and a dessert.<br /><br />okawa has a two roll special for 8, which includes soup or salad. filling, good (not amazing)<br /><br /><br />mamma rosa&#039;s has a handful of choices at 7, including a couple of parm sandwiches (good) and pastas i haven&#039;t tried. both come with salad or broccoli.<br /><br />of the many Chinese options, i find Lin&#039;s to be the best.

				I highly recommend the Thenthuk (https://simplytibetan.com/2011/12/26/thenthuk/) from any of the neighborhood Nepali/Tibetan eateries.&nbsp; This is a filling, nourishing, meat/radish/noodle soup that is my favorite neighborhood comfort food, especially on a cold night.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been gradually trying the beef thenthuk at many places throughout the neighborhood, and my favorite so far is at Lali Guras ($6, I think).

				Occasionally, I will visit Jose Fish Market at 8104 Roosevelt Ave only for their $2.75 fish chowder which is incredible and made fresh all day long.&nbsp; &nbsp;The fish chowder is not a meal but for those who want a full meal they have many choices of fried seafood such as whiting, shrimp, scallops, flounder, crab stick which includes either french fries or rice priced from $4.00 to $7.75 and the portions are large.&nbsp; You can dine in or take out.&nbsp; No table service plus no tax.&nbsp; Incredible bargain.&nbsp; The least expensive is the whiting with the fries or rice for just $4.00.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat fried foods but considering how busy this place is I&#039;m certain you won&#039;t be disappointed.&nbsp;

				The baked empanadas at La Gran Uruguaya Bakery are great. Get one spinach and one <em>carne</em>, and don&#039;t forget to ask for <em>picante,</em> their homemade hot sauce, which has avocado dice in it.<br /><br />Our favorite halal cart is the one in front of TD Bank, directly on 37th Avenue (at 74th Street). Be sure to go to the one that&#039;s located right on 37th Ave., facing Duane Reade, since there&#039;s another cart at that corner on 74th. The lamb and chicken over rice with white and green sauce is delicious, and the guys who run the cart are friendly.
