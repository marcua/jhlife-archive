				Have we posted about this before, and I just didnâ€™t notice it? This story (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/nyregion/04cremate.html) must be read to be believed. According to the article, the owners of Bangladesh Plaza are Humanists, a married couple one of whom was raised Muslim, the other Hindu. When they decided to have their son cremated in Hindu tradition rather than buried, chaos ensued on 73<sup>rd</sup> Street including a street protest and alleged arson and bomb threats. The article also says the issue is national news in Bangladesh and the subject of articles in local Bangla newspapers.<br /><br />â€¢ Anne Barnard with Toby Lyles, â€œHindu-Muslim Family in Queens Chooses Cremation, and Faces Criticism (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/nyregion/04cremate.html),â€ <em>The New York Times</em>, 3 October 2008.

				1010Wins was also reporting on this story.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes I agree it&#039;s scary.&nbsp; The mother a Hindu and the father a Muslism. Since he was buried in the Hindu tradition the Muslim friends of the family were the ones that made the so called threats of bombing and setting fire to the building.&nbsp; They deny making the threats at this time.

				As a Jew, I can sympathize to some extent with local MuslimÃ»n who feel that a Muslim adult should have a Muslim funeral regardless of how any surviving parents feel. Had Shafayet Reja been a minor, it might be a different story, but he was twenty-two years old and died when returning home from no less than a Ramadan <em>iftar</em> organized by the Muslim Students Association at SUNY Stony Brook. This does not necessarily mean he identified solely or even primarily as a Muslim, but after his death, school friends conveniently came forward with hearsay that he had stated he specifically was a Muslim and wanted a Muslim burial, something I have a hard time imagining a healthy college student would think to bring up in conversation. The secular Humanist in me thinks what happens to his body after his death is less important than the feelings of his living family, and everyone but those in his immediate family should just butt out as clearly he left behind no legally binding advance directives. As a gay man, I wonder if the family should make decisions without considering the validity of Shafayetâ€™s â€œfamily of choice,â€ his friends who may have known him better than his parents did. After all this thinking, I conclude that the traditions of one religion or culture is not inherently better than any other, so donâ€™t bother the family in a time of mourning to imply so. The choice is theirs in lieu of any reliable documentation left behind by Shafayet.

I gave my pop analysis of the base issue, but the organized reaction to the issue is quite alarming. Definite undercurrents of extremism are present as the deceasedâ€™s mother, Mina Saha Farah, identifies as a Humanist and wrote articles and books, including <em>God on Trial</em>, about the rights of women and ethnic and religious minorities in Bangladesh. A common tactic of the right wing of any community is to claim that criticism of them is an attack on the community as a whole, and like in so many other cases, including that of the book and movie <em>Persepolis</em>, extremist Muslimun have declared that her writing is not so much critical of the right wing as anti-Islamic, then with that as ammunition, a street protest was organized. We may never know if the arson and bomb threats actually occurred, but I feel Shafayetâ€™s parents are less likely to fabricate stories about fellow Bangladeshis than religious extremists are to recant embarrassing statements.

				What concerns me also is that if these religious extremists do act out their threats, then we in Jackson Heights will be victims of these religious extremists.&nbsp; When I heard the story on 1010Wins on Friday I was alarmed.&nbsp; Saturday evening when my partner and I went to dinner to Armondo&#039;s, instead of walking on 73rd street to 37th avenue, we walked up to 37th Road and down 74th street to 37th avenue.
