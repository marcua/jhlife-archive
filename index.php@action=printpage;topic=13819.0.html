Ground chuck is one of the most popular varieties seen on the market today. Whole beef chucks are ground without adding fat or beef trimmings which produces a rich beefy tasting burger.<br /><br />Whole muscle cuts take burger art to the next level in a variety of ways. For example, at Buedel Fine Meats, we produce burgers from whole muscle cuts of USDA Prime Angus beef, USDA Choice Angus beef, a blend of both Prime and Choice Angus beef, and blends of whole muscle Brisket/Short Rib/Chuck. This unique combination brings together the buttery flavor of the brisket with the richness of the short rib and the traditional beefy flavor of the chuck producing a juicy burger that bursts with layers of decadent flavor.<br />http://www.buedelmeatup.com/2013/06/26/the-art-of-the-burger/

				I think this is still the bodega space (Jimmy&#039;s Deli, then Earthly something) NEXT to the empty pharmacy space. That pharmacy moved/is moving to the block with Table Wine. So, down one bodega, up one burger place, pharmacies at equilibrium.

				From that picture Miss Jackson, it looks like you&#039;re correct. It is that former bodega sight.<br /><br />So there is still the possibility that some entrepreneurial spirit may come in and decide to replace the pharmacy that moved across the street with another pharmacy.<br /><br />There is a large pharmacy opening next to El Coyote called vida pharmacy, so with that being said, pharmacy and burgers up one&nbsp; each, bodegas down one.

				Hopefully this place is good, unlike the crepes place. Something I never understood is why someone would open up a restaurant, but serve mediocre or average food. You figure you could at the very least copy someone else&#039;s recipes. My friend said that people just want to open up businesses without having the knowledge and skills to actually run a successful one, which is perhaps true. Both Emoji and Swim Two Birds have a ton of potential though. <br /><br />

				Amazingjason,&nbsp; once again I think you&#039;re spot on. I actually like Okawas food, and have been recently wanting to tell them that people are probably not going to go to a sushi place if their windows are so dirty. But, they really should know that already. Such a simple thing to do.

				good to know emoji burger has connection to Just Made 4 U.<br />They were slow to start but seem to be able to get it right.<br /><br />As far as Okawa, I too was hesitant to eat in based on the window and looking unappealing inside.&nbsp; I recently ventured in for the lunch special (sushi rolls) and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.&nbsp; Its&#039; not my sushi place for delivery.&nbsp; Not sure why the Japanese places here do not do better on decor.

I&#039;ve only been once in LA a few years ago...high-quality burgers with interesting flavor combinations. Especially stuff with &quot;umami&quot; flavors like mushrooms, truffle oil, salty aged cheese, etc.

				It does look (and smell) good, so definitely looking forward to trying it. i didn&#039;t go in for close examination, but from menu prices, it looks as if the burgers will be on the smaller side, which i tend to prefer -- unless i&#039;m starving, i throw in the towel on a 10 ounce pub burger most times.

				My boyfriend and I just went to try out Emoji Burger, and WOW, what a success!&nbsp; The space is cute inside--a little cramped given the small size, but well built-out, with nice lighting and ambiance for a little neigborhood burger joint.&nbsp; As for the burgers themselves.&nbsp; As a devotee of, and regular visitor to, Shake Shack, I can confidently say that that these burgers are just as good, if not better, than Shake Shack&#039;s.&nbsp; Pat LaFrieda beef, Martin&#039;s potato buns, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; Their default doneness is medium, which is just right--the burgers develop that lacy, crispy edge, while still being moist and tender and juicy on the inside.&nbsp; I had the &quot;Ori Emo,&quot; (which is their name for the regular cheeseburger), and my boyfriend had the &quot;Da Wink,&quot; which is the regular cheeseburger with applewood bacon.&nbsp; Both were fantastic.&nbsp; We also split the Emo Fries, which are fries with bacon bits, grated parmesan, scallion, and the house aioli.&nbsp; These were also good, though I actually think I might have preferred just plain fries, as the fries themselves were fried to perfection.&nbsp; One quibble--they bring out packets of ketchup right now, and I think that squeeze bottles at the table might be better (at least for those of us who like generous amounts of ketchup on burgers and fries).&nbsp; <br /><br />Short take:&nbsp; this place, only two days in, is poised to be a neighborhood fixture, if not a destination spot for people in nearby neighborhoods.&nbsp; <strong>SERIOUSLY</strong> good burgers!&nbsp;

				I stopped in this afternoon and got an outgoing order.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty good.&nbsp; It&#039;s not Minetta Tavern or Spotted Pig good, but hey, it&#039;s a fraction of the price and you don&#039;t have to hike into Manhattan.&nbsp; If you feel like a burger and don&#039;t feel like leaving the neighborhood it&#039;s going to be the place to go.&nbsp; Nice to see a lot of families, that&#039;s good for the neighborhood as is the large number of jobs created for such a small storefront.&nbsp; <br /><br />The patties are indeed on the small side.&nbsp; Since the buns are full size, choice of potato or sesame, the patties are very thin in order to fill the bun.&nbsp; That unfortunately leaves the single patty burger on the wee bit too little side and the double on the way too much side, at least for me.&nbsp; The shredded iceberg lettuce did make me unhappy.&nbsp; The fries are forgettable.&nbsp; They&#039;re just frozen, very thin cut fries.&nbsp; Not terrible or anything, but meh.<br /><br />It would have been nice if they had followed through on the concept they had for the meat with the rest of the ingredients.&nbsp; I.e., fresh cut potatoes, romaine lettuce, etc.&nbsp; To cut them some slack, I&#039;d bet a lot of that is due to trying to keep to a price point they feel would be viable in this neighborhood.

				I tried yesterday and I thought the burger was great! I had a beef burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms, tomato and cheese (I think this is called the ODada but I don&#039;t recall). Onions were more grilled than caramelized, but they still tasted good. I added the emoji aioli to the burger, which was a pleasantly salty (although not overpoweringly so) and creamy addition. My medium burger was closer to medium rare which was totally fine for me, but those who don&#039;t like their meat pink might want to order a higher temperature than usual. Overall, delish- ingredients were good, I thought the size was perfect, and I&#039;ll be back! <br /><br />A couple of other notes- I don&#039;t know that the comparison to Minetta Tavern and Spotted Pig is warranted; those are bistro burgers, and that&#039;s not what Emoji is trying to do. As others have noted, they&#039;re much more in line with Shake Shack in style, and I agree that they totally measure up! <br /><br />To the reviewer who mentioned cheese: listening to others order, the staff seemed very open to customization, so I think you could simply order any of the burgers without cheese. Between mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce, grilled onion, and a few aoilis (although I realize that again that&#039;s dairy), you won&#039;t have any shortage of non-cheese toppings. <br /><br />The space was crowded and the staff are still working out ordering kinks, but doing an admirable job managing huge crowds with loud children and complicated orders.

				The turkey burger was really good-had avocado, feta cheese and of course made to order. Had a passion fruit shake, wow, that was great also.&nbsp; Maybe once they have the hang of it, they can do something like bareburger and can choose your meat for the type of burger. They also have desserts-crepes (not arepas) with choice of fruit or nutella.

				Had takeout from here tonight.&nbsp; Good burger.&nbsp; Reasonably priced for the quality.&nbsp; Sort of like a thicker Petey&#039;s burger.&nbsp; On par with 5 guys or Shake Shack I think.&nbsp; As stated on their menu, the fries were most definetly fresh cut. I know this is contrary to an earlier posting. Not sure, but maybe due to the initial rush they had to resort to frozen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also had a plain dog.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think the usual NYC toppings (sour kraut, onions) are available.&nbsp; Still a tasty, snappy dog.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it&#039;s a bit cramped.&nbsp; Especially for the stroller set.<br /><br />Certainly a nice addition to the nabe!!

				You are quite correct, ptbass.&nbsp; The fries were frozen on my first visit, but definitely fresh cut last night.&nbsp; The patties were also significantly thicker.&nbsp; I suspect they were slammed on Saturday night and were running out of stuff as well as losing their minds with the flood of people.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t on par with Shake Shack then, but was definitely equal or better on my second visit.&nbsp; <br /><br />BTW, they say they deliver.&nbsp; ;-)<br /><br />

				Tired Emoji yesterday for lunch.&nbsp; We had what is basically their cheeseburger on the sesame bun and the fries. My reaction was mixed--was lacking a bit in taste...maybe the burger seems overwhelmed by the bun and lettuce inside.&nbsp; &nbsp;I enjoyed the fries.&nbsp; Will want to try some of the other burger choices.&nbsp; Don&#039;t think this compares to Shake Shack--although I think their burger quality is not what it was now that it is a global company vs. when it was just a shack in Madison Sq. Park.&nbsp; &nbsp;As someone else noted, one thing Emoji can improve is the quality of its ketchup and mustard--the yellow mustard and ketchup packs don&#039;t live up to the quality burger joint they are going for.&nbsp; Appreciate the thought in the decor and creative menu.&nbsp; By the looks of it, this place will be successful, I will definitely give it another try.&nbsp;

				Burger was really delicious. I wish they had salads and more drinks other than shakes (too fattening, I&#039;d never have one). Since they are owned by the same people as Just Made 4 You, maybe they could work it so that you could order food from both places. That happened in my old neighborhood. There were two restaurants side by side owned by the same people. And you could order off either menu or from both menus. They eventually combined into one larger place (one side became a bar/lounge). Anyway I&#039;m a big fan of Just Made 4 You, and though I enjoyed my turkey burger at emoji very much, on a regular basis I eat more salads and veggies than burgers. It would be ideal if I could order a salad AND a burger, and maybe split each with my husband. I just don&#039;t tend to eat a burger and fries for a meal: too carb and fat heavy. And so far emoji has no veggies except fries. That said, they seem to be doing good business with lots of takeout.&nbsp; I salute them! As I said, the burger was yummy with the aioli, avocado, etc, they added to it. <br />

				Salads would be great. I&#039;d love a lettuce wrap option, which I have enjoyed at Petey&#039;s and Five Guys.

				The salads from the other place is a great idea. They should just deliver it for free. that would be great. One time I went to a restaurant in Quebec where we walked down the street to their other restaurant and did shots (2x). Very cool experience to bring the sidewalk to part of the equation.

				I enjoyed the burger and fries - a terrific addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I believe they do have other drinks in bottles - it looked like there was beverages fridge in the back.&nbsp; I do wish they would have a toppings list like Five Guys and let the buyer pick the toppings - their choices are all on the heavy side for me, and I like my jalopenos.

				I returned for a second time this week and had a different experience. While the burger was fine, my cheesy fries were soggy and just barely sprinkled with any cheese... certainly not worth the $4.50. In addition, the person who took my takeout order did not seem to be able to work the register, and I noticed that two dine-in orders had to be corrected while I was standing there waiting. <br /><br />So after a good first impression, they came up short the second time... But I&#039;ll go back and give them a third try.

				I wish they had hard drinks as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, admittedly, it&#039;s a little too tight in there for me to sit and enjoy myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;Speaking of which, somebody on Jackson Heights families posted a response to an email sent to the founder a bare burger.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, they are eyeing our neighborhood to open another franchise.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would think the former site of gothic cabinet craft would make a great spot.&nbsp; Maybe they could create free range pollos a la brasa chicken burger to fit in with some of the surrounding restaurants.

				I&#039;m not a fan of bareburger at all. I dont think the burgers taste good, and the place is very generic. It is like the perfect chain restaurant though.... Great marketing, great menus, everything runs really well. If you go to LIC, I think it is actually a shame that their bareburger is so crowded while other, singular small businesses are empty. The fact is.... the bareburger is a great place for families, and in LIC, they are the only game in town for that.
