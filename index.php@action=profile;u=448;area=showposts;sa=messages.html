					Good morning everyone,<br /><br />We have been renting out art studios in Woodside since 2009. We kept the rent super reasonable all these years and some of our tenants have been with us since we have opened. Our studios are on the second floor of a commercial building, with 24/7 access, heat, and AC all year around. Woodside is developing rapidly with small businesses, eateries, and restaurants. We are conveniently located on 55th Street, close to the M and the R stop, 10 min by biking, and 15 min walking from Jackson Heights.<br /><br />We are now offering a few rentals and share opportunities:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp; One studio with skylight, 19&#039; x 12&#039;, ready to be occupied on January 1, 2020. All studios are completely private, have 24/7 access, skylights (no windows), heat, and AC all year around. <br /><br />2. My former, sunny studio (5 windows!!!), has been rented to a local artist who works in the mornings. If you are looking for a studio share in a lovely, sun-filled studio, and perhaps you work on weekends, afternoons, and evenings, this be the perfect spot for you!<br /><br />3. One-month half-price sublet, January 1-30th, at the new wing, as the tenant will be only moving in February. 1st.<br /><br /><br />For all inquiries, prices, and details please get in touch directly: <a href="mailto:deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Happy holidays!!!<br /><br />Deb<br />

					Unity Stage has served as a highly successful youth theater in Western Queens since 2010, producing summer programs as well as annual musicals and plays performed by children and teens. Godspell marks Unity Stage&#039;s first middle school production. Godspell performs May 18th @6pm and May 19th @3pm at P.S. 212Q in Jackson Heights. (The musical comedy The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, starring Unity Stage&#039;s teen company, performs June 8th and 9th in the same space.) <br />Godspell features famous songs like Day by Day, By My Side, and Beautiful City as the 17 Student Performers from Sunnyside &amp; Jackson Heights use storytelling, games, and a hefty dose of comic timing to bring Jesus’ messages of kindness, tolerance, and love vibrantly to life. The updated production dissolves hauntingly into The Last Supper and Jesus&#039; final moments.&nbsp; Visit <a href="http://www.unitystage.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.unitystage.org</a> for tickets: $5 Per Child, $10 Per Senior/Teen, and $20 Per Adult,

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />A new space just opened up for rental. Located on 55th Street between 37 Ave and Broadway, It&#039;s 1050sf facing the streets with many windows. Space is divided into four rooms but can easily be reconfigured into two large rooms too. Right now, space has wall to wall carpet but we can easily remove it. All depends on the nature of the company who wishes to rent it. It&#039;s perfect for a group of artists/writers/creative friends to share, or a design/architectural company.&nbsp; Space has 24/7 access, it&#039;s very quiet (Top, second-floor post-war commercial building). $2400 including ALL utilities. Price negotiable. Email me at : <a href="mailto:deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">deborahwasserman.art@gmail.com</a>. Thanks!!!!
