I heard that last night there was also a stabbing atthe KFC on 88 and northern around the same time of this incident...

					I was just wondering if anyone has taken advantage of the free swim lessons offered during the summer at fisher pool in the previous years... I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old and was wondering if it&#039;s recommended... What exactly do they do... I have never been to that pool but have heard negative things about it so I&#039;m on the fence... Any feedback would be greatly appreciated...

					I went to junior high with her... I was on tmz when the pole dancing controversy came out and her name sounded so familiar I just couldn&#039;t remember from where then it hit me and since I lost my 145 yearbook I looked for my autograph book (yes I still have that lol) and there was her message for me... She was just as bubbly and nice as she appears on tv...

					Hey if he can take the subway and get to work so can the rest of us.... Isn&#039;t that his motto? To bad he forgets that plenty of teachers have to travel into NYC from L.I and Jersey and as a mom just because the roads are plowed that doesn&#039;t mean the sidewalks are clean... Just the walk home from school today was horrible the sidewalks are slushy and slippery and we are expecting the brunt of it tonight and throughout the day tomorrow...

					I delivered both my kids at elmhurst and had a good experience... As for prenatal care I think it was quite frustrating at times going there and waiting forever to be seen but then again that seems to be the case at many hospitals... I had dr.lee the first time around and she was great a doctor who actually remembered her patients... Very kind lady great obgyn... Second time I felt my doc was just rushing all her patients didn&#039;t really like this one... And I agree the pediatric ER has been great except for one snooty doc who just rushed us ou only to get a second opinion from our regular doc and get diagnosed with an ear infection but oops I&#039;ve sidetracked... I had good experiences but go where you feel comfortable... I wish your wife a happy and healthy pregnancy and congrats on the baby<br />I would also appreciate a good recommendation for a pediatrician as I am done taking my son to<br />elmhurst for his doc appointments it&#039;s absolutly ridiculous the wait time to be seen... thanks!

					Lucky for me I&#039;ve never had to visit the elmhurst ER but I have taken my kids to the pediatric ER more than once... Was attended to rather quickly and received Speedy treatment my then 6 month old son was having breathing problems... On the other hand my daughter was seen on the same day and received okay care but the doctor on call was not so nice he wouldn&#039;t listen and according to him my daughters high temperature was not a fever... He said when she has temp of 105 bring her in and he didn&#039;t listen to us when she said her ear was bothering her sent us off saying there was nothing He could do took he the next day To her regular pediatrician and behold she had an ear infection... My only real gripe with elmhurst is the pediatric clinic I&#039;ve had appointments at 1 sometimes 2 in the afternoon only to be out of there close to 5 pm... Hours and hours of waiting only to be seen for not even 5 minutes by the doc... They really need to get on the ball and be more organized because the wait time to be seen is incredible...if I get out of there in 3 hours it&#039;s a miracle... My son had an appointment today @ 12 got there early and was finally able to leave after 3... If elmhurst could fix that one problem I&#039;d be happy... But I will be changing to a private practice as I am sick and tires of spending my entire day at the hospital only to be seen for five minutes it&#039;s just not worth it.

					Chuckster they are pretty cheap between 8-10 dollars which is why they fly off the shelves and have been very lucrative to resellers.... I just walked in to cvs on northern and 90 and they had the accessories just not the actual hamster &nbsp;<img src="Smileys/default/angry.gif" alt="&gt;&#58;&#40;" title="Angry" class="smiley" /> &nbsp;thinking of taking a trip to the 70&#039;s and see if I can find one there if not I&#039;ll keep stopping by everyday on the off chance I find one on the shelves.... Again if anyone does find them at a local cvs please let me know asap Or just get me one or two (2 is better as I have 2 kids) and I will gladly mee you and reimburse you for your purchase....my daughter is asking for one for x-mas and I would hate to disappoint her but if I can&#039;t find one I guess she&#039;ll just have to wait.... Spread some holiday cheer! &nbsp;<span style="color: green;" class="bbc_color"></span>

					Okay I am a mom to a four year old and a 14 month old now x-mas season has already started and unfortunately for me my daughter wants one of those damn zhu zhu pets lol.... Now I heard a rumor that cvs pharmacy has/ had or will have them this week.... If any of you spot these mysterious creatures at any local cvs please let me know.... Or if anyone wants to help a mom out and buy one or two for me I would be willing to pick up from you and reimburse you.... Please don&#039;t snatch the joy out of the holiday season by buying these little creatures and selling them for 5x the retail price... All you are doing is making lots of kids very sad and making these economic times a little tougher on the working parents... Spread the joy of the holidays....merry Christmas all only 24 days to go! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" />
