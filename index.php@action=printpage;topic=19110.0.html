				JK resident.... I&#039;m super-glad you&#039;re happy that, like 13 other states and Washington DC who have laws like this on the books, we will be a more humane state because of the passage of this law. <br /><br />Also: <strong>no person is illegal.</strong> It&#039;s a deliberate framing to dehumanise people. They are undocumented.<br /><br />If you became &quot;illegal&quot; upon<em>&nbsp; suspicion of breaking a law</em>, <strong>which is what undoccumented immigrants are</strong>, then I look forward to you referring to every person in this country as illegal. <br /><br />

				My comments are neutral. I just state that there will soon be many more licensed drivers in NYS. There are two sides to the coin. If this is a good or bad idea is really to be determined by others.

				I think the law is great.&nbsp; The reality:&nbsp; you need a license to drive, and you need to stay out of trouble if you are undocumented to stay in this country.&nbsp; While this reality does not create much of a clash in NYC given our transit system, it absolutely does in the rest of NYS.&nbsp; Pulled over for a broken tail light?&nbsp; Then you get arrested for driving without a license and there&#039;s a fine and/or prison time as a result of the offense.&nbsp; If you get prison time, then you are on ICE&#039;s must go list.<br /><br />Why do we have to criminalize everything?&nbsp; Why not give licenses to everyone, require that they carry insurance, and remove one area of concern.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good for NYS.

				If you&#039;re living in this country and are not a citizen then the government has the authority to A) keep track of you and b) remove you if you are here in defiance of immigration laws.&nbsp; This is not some horrible thing that only the U.S. does, every single country on this planet operates the same way, many of them with far stricter policies than us.<br /><br />If they can&#039;t get a NYS or other U.S. license because they aren&#039;t a citizen then they should have an international license.&nbsp; If they can&#039;t get that because they are living here illegally then the appropriate government authorities should know about them, it&#039;s as simple as that.<br /><br />I am in favor of some form of amnesty at this point based on how long someone has been here, or other family circumstances perhaps.&nbsp; But I am NOT in favor of just giving a carte blanche to everyone to break our immigration laws.&nbsp; NY and CA have lost the plot.

				The undocumented (illegals) would need to become legalized by the passage of laws that&nbsp; allow those unlawfully present in the United States without criminal records to adjust their status.

If you run a red light or a stop sign, which most people probably have, you could hit someone who&#039;s crossing the intersection. I see you went well out of your way to include the parenthetical notation &quot;illegals&quot; in your comment. You should know that the process for most undocumented people to become residents is now nearly impossible thanks to the ridiculous immigration laws being put in place by the racist president who also loves the term &quot;illegals.&quot; Go drive into the ocean.

You&#039;re very pointedly calling them &quot;illegals,&quot; not even &quot;illegal aliens&quot; as you just mentioned. Calling them &quot;illegals&quot; minimizes their entire identity to the fact that they came here illegally. If you ran a stoplight and hit someone, people wouldn&#039;t be calling you an &quot;illegal driver&quot; or shortening that to &quot;an illegal&quot; simply because you drove through a light and hit someone. And hitting someone with your car is way more harmful than entering a country illegally to escape poverty, gangs, and crime. When you refer to someone as &quot;an illegal,&quot; you&#039;re being willfully obtuse. &quot;Illegal alien&quot; sounds harsh but yes, it&#039;s factual. It means someone is here illegally. But referring to someone simply as &quot;an illegal&quot; is where you&#039;re in the wrong.

You live in JH, right? Every day of my life here I see people littering all over the street, triple-parking, running red lights, almost hitting people (including me, many times) as they drive. None of those people get penalized. Have you ever seen someone in this neighborhood get a ticket for littering? How many times have you almost been hit by a negligent driver?<br /><br />Coming to this country illegally isn&#039;t putting other people in harm&#039;s way like running a red light is. And you clearly know no one from a Latin American country who has tried to become a resident, because it&#039;s nearly impossible. The current administration has caused people to live in fear of ever getting a visa or gaining legal status. For people from certain countries, there is no &quot;jumping the line,&quot; because they&#039;re not being allowed in in the first place. Think of how many people apply to the visa lottery.<br /><br />This country was founded by immigrants, and surely your ancestors are among them. Ever look at an old census from the times when immigration to the US was booming in the 20th century? You can see clearly how many white immigrants came here illegally—look at an old NYC census and you&#039;d be surprised at how many people have &quot;Alien&quot; written next to their name. Many of those people never naturalized, even though it was WAY easier to do it back then. If it was that easy now, we&#039;d surely have close to no undocumented people.<br /><br />Maybe you should consider having empathy for those whose struggles are different than yours. If you live here, you know many of your neighbors—people who make your food, pour your drinks, sell you what you need—are undocumented. Are they bad people simply because they wanted a better life? If you actually took the time to talk to them, you&#039;d know that many put their own lives at risk to come here. No one WANTS to live a life of hiding and fear. If it was easy to become a resident, everyone would do it.

				&quot;Illegals&quot; is obviously referring to &quot;Illegal Aliens&quot; which is a term of status.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get bent out of shape because people want to use contractions.... it&#039;s generally understood by most people (if they are honest and not just driving an ideological point) what you are referring to when using the word &quot;illegals&quot;.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a slur against their race or cultural background, and it isn&#039;t trying to encompass their whole being and define people by this one word, it&#039;s just simply a normal categorization that refers to a large group of people who, by their actions, share a similar disregard for the immigration laws of this country.<br /><br />I don&#039;t normally argue semantics but I find this whole argument of changing language to protect fragile feelings to be asinine.&nbsp; Are we all adults here or what?
