				People complain that folks won&#039;t be able to get deliveries, they also complain that there&#039;s delivery vehicles everywhere. <br />They complain about speeding bicycles, but would rather go back to the status quo of speeding cars, trucks, and SUV&#039;s so that more people can drive through our neighborhood. <br />There&#039;s dog crap everywhere! Can&#039;t they please go back to only crapping and peeing on the sidewalk like before?<br />They want to bring up the congestion on 82nd St and 74th St business streets which have always been a traffic nightmare and somehow blame it on 34th Ave. <br /><br />This open 34th ave is obviously not working out. Nobody goes there- it&#039;s too crowded.&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;m always amazed by how much energy people expend bickering about 34th Avenue being open. If that energy were focused on, oh I don&#039;t know, the illegal night clubs, prostitution, the gang issues, the bands of constantly drunk men that harass women on 37th Ave and Roosevelt, the men that harass women on the street in general, people shooting up on the streets and in Travers Park, people getting shooty and stabby, the increase in muggings, open drug dealing, etc, etc. it may be that we could actually get something done about these things, which would have a far greater impact on our community.<br /><br />Honestly, I like that 34th Ave is open but there are more important things going on, many of which have been issues long before the pandemic. If it was closed down tomorrow, I would be fine with it if the situation with the issues above were improved. How is it that 34th Ave deserves so much more attention than the real problems facing this community? This is an honest question.

				I live on 34th Avenue. At the present time, as lovely as it can be, it’s not safe and it’s not terribly sanitary. If it’s to remain an open street, it needs improvements. And by improvements, I mean enforced rules. Bikes and motor bikes go in every direction at every speed in all parts of the road. Cars (drivers)move the barriers but after they enter they don’t put the barriers back. That leads more drivers to enter the street assuming it’s open. I replaced barriers twice today during a walk, and they are heavy for me.&nbsp; My favorite part of the open street is sitting on the median and having a coffee/snack. But the grassy areas have too much garbage and smell of dog waste. So... maybe increase monitoring, repaint bike lanes, better signage, more garbage receptacles?&nbsp; Please don’t mock me for my opinion, as I see sometimes happen on this site. If my kids were still little I would not let them play on the street because of the random wheeled traffic.

				I live on 34th Avenue and am in support for open streets. As a possible permanent public space, there are definitely solutions to maintain quality and cleanliness that can found and employed that are currently in use in most of our public parks today.<br /><br />Agreed that we can use more signage, better marked bicycle paths, a better and more frequent system to maintain cleanliness within and around the median. Perhaps, we can designate pedestrian only paths/safe zones to improve public safety. I’ve seen this implemented in other notable parks and it helps to keep pedestrians out of the bike path as well.<br /><br />I think we should be able to have both the open streets and a fully functional community and senior center— keeping in mind that these buildings are realistically only a fraction of the size and space that the open street currently is. If anything, say if you live in the high 80’s/90’s and the centers are in the mid to low 70’s, it could be a journey to reach. At least, having both options will improve instead of deter accessibility in some ways. If senior citizens want to be close to home and play bingo right outside on the open streets rather than getting into a car going back and forth, they should have the option to do so. <br /><br />

				All this attention to 34th Avenue is ridiculous, yes let&#039;s not have dog poop on 34th Avenue so it piles up everywhere else in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Have never heard anything from DOT or our local politicians on the impact this will have on neighboring streets when more opens up in the city and traffic increases.&nbsp; What is the solution for the heavy metal barriers, many elderly, disabled folks can&#039;t get out of the car to move them if they need to park or reach their home.&nbsp; Delivery trucks in the middle make it dangerous to cross, since they block the view if a motor delivery bike is coming down the street.&nbsp; There are so many things that need to be addressed beyond having the elderly play bingo in the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Why did they pick the widest residential street that cuts through JH? Do people need 4 lanes to jog? It would have been more practical to close 35th avenue or, better, 37th avenue to traffic. <br /><br />With 34th avenue closed to traffic, 35th avenue is now overcrowded. Trucks block the only lane. People honk horns at all hours. I have seen ambulances stuck in traffic.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am all for closing 37th avenue to traffic permanently with large areas on side streets left for trucks to temporarily park (technically, stand?) for unloading. As I have said before, we need parking structures. But, all available space is being used for new schools since the neighborhood is above its designed capacity. <br /><br />If we had parking structures then some cross streets could be closed with bike lanes. <br /><br />I am not against closed streets. I just want it done in an appropriate way. Not in a pie in the sky way, like demanding that the city buy a car dealership.<br /><br />The superblock type idea would work here since we have a grid system. But, it would only work with adequate parking.&nbsp; <br /><br />https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barcelona-ban-cars-traffic-pollution_n_5dd6665ae4b0fc53f20e6bbd (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barcelona-ban-cars-traffic-pollution_n_5dd6665ae4b0fc53f20e6bbd)<br /><br /><br /><br />

Maybe a politician or someone who just wants an immediate fix without long term assessment?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If Jackson Heights is a heart, the main working artery is 34th Avenue. It&#039;s a wide through street with lot&#039;s of room for pedestrians, a long standing successful bike lane and swift access for residents, businesses, service and emergency vehicles. It&#039;s not broke! But 37th Ave is broke. And the Open Streets program could create a terrific plaza situation which would be a wonderful boon to our commercial district which is in high need right now. We need to be directing traffic and resources to 37th Ave asap! There are restaurants, lot&#039;s of retail, seating, trash cans and so much more that was discusses as needing to be brought to 34th Ave. Why in world world would you be bringing amenities to one avenue in a neighborhood when they already exist on another two blocks away???<br />&nbsp; Losing the assets of 34th Ave to a pedestrian mall looks very similar to me to the public cry for Green Space, Green Space, Green Space that has resulted in the shrinking grassy mound in Travers Park that replaced the play field our kids once had. The mound is unsustainable!! It looked great for a short time and people were happy but now that&#039;s over and upkeep is very costly. When the fence comes down for a few days, the Green Space goes to mud quickly from people who miss the play field. BUT the public was happy! And this is how the 34th Ave planning is going.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The public may like hearing about the possibility of permanence but the MTA and DOT and other agencies think their best projects are small and incremental. They cite various areas of Broadway in Manhattan as public spaces that evolved slowly and with lots of changes, not a blanket sweep and overnight type of change as it being proposed on 34th Ave now. In fact, they would prefer quite the opposite if you have a longer conversation with them. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I do believe we could have closures from time to time on some side streets for things like the Green Markets and school recess and summer fairs. But the 34th Ave closure is not a considered project at this time and we should record everyone&#039;s name who is promoting this so when it is a more of a tishstorm at full return to post Covid life, they will be held accountable. Save our 37th Ave commercial areas and turn them into viable plazas that benefit the whole JH community!!!<br /></strong></span></strong></span>

				^^the final form of 34th Avenue Open Street is not its current form. I don&#039;t understand why people assume it is going to stay how it currently is, which BTW requires volunteers to move the barricades twice a day and is not a sustainable model.

				^Definitely. When I mention input, I mean they should be addressing their concerns through these workshops. From there the DOT can decide what rationally needs to be addressed or what are just possibly only negative assumptions. (And yes, I have inputted feedback as to the benefits of the open streets and thoughts to any improvements that could be made).

				“We’re ultimately trying to get equity on our streets. We built the city around the automobile to disastrous results,” said Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris. “Our challenge for incoming leaders is to think about the incredible success in minor street transformations and scale that across the entire city.”<br /><br />The vision, called “NYC 25 by 25,” has the backing of more than 80 organizations, including the 34th Avenue Open Streets Coalition, 89th Street Tenants Unidos Association in Jackson Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, Families for Safe Streets, La Colmena, Pakistani-American Youth Society, the Street Vendor Project at the Urban Justice Center, Tri-State Transportation Committee, and Bike NY.<br /><br />And together, they’re asking mayoral candidates to reimagine 25 percent of the space currently allocated for vehicles — including 19,000 miles of travel lanes and three million on-street parking spaces — as public space within four years to create a healthier New York that puts people above cars, especially as the city recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, a health crisis that shined a light on the city’s unequal access to transportation and green space.<br /><br />--------------------------<br /><br />The future is getting closer and closer. Reactionaries are swimming against the tide and will be on the wrong side of history.

Not most of Jackson Heights, as we have many options. but many areas in Southeast Queens and others have limited options and somebody or some organization in their world has a vehicle. Many church group rides their seniors to shopping that they could not navigate through transit with stairs being just one of the obstacles. Bus waits can be interminable. In household budgets in Western Queens, cars may not be needed for everyone but if you leave our neighborhood and if you have your own business, we are talking a different story. And yes, this is how many people cut it in other parts of Queens where car culture thrives for a variety of reasons, one being it can be too challenging in their 2021 lives without. But in the future, with planning and improved transit and other options, it may change. Hope so...<br />

				Well, if a person lives in suburban settings, they get far more space. Like off the subway lines in Queens or Staten Island.<br /><br />But transport options are poorer.<br /><br />Life is choices. <br /><br />I am looking at NYC urban settings. Like Jackson Heights. Us.<br /><br />Faraway places have their own parameters.<br /><br />I wish them well in those far off neighborhoods. Good luck to them and their solutions.<br /><br />They have very little to do with our urban lifestyles. And are closer to Long Island/New Jersey living. The suburbs.
