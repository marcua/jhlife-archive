					I sent this on May 23, but apparently missed Jackson Heights Life.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/embarrassed.gif" alt="&#58;-&#091;" title="Embarrassed" class="smiley" /><br /><hr /><br />May 23, 2017<br /><br />Fellow Jackson Heights Residents,<br /><br />This is a somewhat long message, so I’m going to summarize it here for those who’ve been awaiting this email and know what to do: <a href="https://wiki.JacksonHeights.nyc" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://wiki.JacksonHeights.nyc</a> is now ready and waiting for you to share what you know about the neighborhood. (For reasons explained below, the Home page is not editable, all others are.)<br /><strong><br />The Somewhat Long Message.</strong><br /><br />The Jackson Heights wiki exists. It&#039;s in the earliest of days - in biblical terms, a tad past separating the light from the dark. So far there&#039;s not a whole lot to see, maybe 50 pages or so, some of which are stubs - starter pages needing polish and additional detail&nbsp; before they possess real meaning. To give a feel for what’s there now, I’ll describe two existing pages.<br /><br /><strong>Holmes Airport</strong> - I’ve lived in JH for 38 years and had never heard of Holmes Airport until I did a Wikipedia search for Jackson Heights. I learned that Holmes took up almost a quarter of the neighborhood from 1929 to 1940, when LaGuardia Airport opened and ran it out of business. Beyond the page’s raw information, take a look at the Questions, Resources &amp; Possibilities section where several article additions and an Augmented Reality project are described. The page is an example of how our past can be fodder for our future, or put another way, how to build a mountain out of a molehill. (Is your home on the same spot where Amelia Earhart christened the Goodyear blimp Resolute at Holmes in 1932?) See <a href="https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Holmes_Airport" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Holmes_Airport</a>.<br /><br /><strong>The wiki’s Home Page</strong> (<a href="https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Main_Page" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Main_Page</a> - As noted above, this is the only page that can not be edited by the general public. The existence of this solitary “no changes” page provides an opportunity to bring up the need for a formal governance process. For the wiki (I’ll talk about the JacksonHeights.nyc website below), we’re starting out using similar editorial policies and processes to those used on Wikipedia. But because its a neighborhood wiki and not an encyclopedia, we’re going to need to make some changes. There are a lot of sensitive questions about “appropriate content” that need to be answered. Our governance page looks at that and how we make decisions about the wiki policies.<br /><br /><strong>Why The Wiki?</strong><br /><br />We began our effort with the belief that Jackson Heights is built upon the shoulders of those who preceded us. And we see the wiki as an information archive of where we’ve come from, what we’ve done, and what’s here now. As well, a neighborhood wiki should detail resources and stories on how things got and get done.<br /><br />We hope to get all meaningful neighborhood information together in one place and arrange for permanent availability. And there’s no realistic way to do that other than through a massive neighborhood-wide collaboration using wiki software.<br /><br />Wikipedia’s managed to get over 5 million pages in the English language encyclopedia. How many contributors do we need to capture the detail of our neighborhood is unknown. But there are 100,000 residents here to help with the task - plus former residents, visitors, and well wishers - and our wiki software is a most powerful tool.<br /><br />What can you do today? Here are some suggestions, some easy some difficult.<br /><br />* Start a page for an organization you belong to, or improve an existing page about it. Got a memory about a store you loved that is no longer with us (Caffe Greco!), start a page. Write about your building and perhaps some famous past residents (but before writing about current residents, we need to have a conversation about privacy - see the Governance and Appropriate content pages). I recall hearing that former Assembly member Ivan Lafayette had a proposal for an improved local transportation system - if you know anything about it, create a wiki page for it. Are you Cuban, Thai, Indian, or Nepalese? Create a page about your culture’s arrival and impact on Jackson Heights. See a starter page on Cuban Jackson Heights here: <a href="https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Cuban_Jackson_Heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://wiki.jacksonheights.nyc/wiki/Cuban_Jackson_Heights</a>.<br /><br />* Simpler is to copy and past a page from Wikipedia. There are lots. Take a look at the Fifth Avenue Bus Company page. This page was clipped from Wikipedia and posted as a new page on our wiki. It needs to be reorganized and refocused about its role here. Eventually the page might have local photos and remembrances of its impact on JH. It will be a slow build process. Every wiki page is a collaboration that will change over time. For now, just get something started.<br /><br />* Fixing up existing pages is also quite worthwhile - that’s what most Wikipedians (Wikipedia editors) do. Correct spelling, choose a better word, find a reference, update, reorganize - all necessary and worthwhile tasks.<br /><br />* If you’re ambitious, follow up on a theme. For example, I started with a copy and paste from Wikipedia of Travers Park. Next I created a page for Thomas Travers with a bit of googling. Next I added pages for Rory Staunton Field and the Staunton Foundation. Then I added links to other parks, and have stopped “parking” for now.<br /><br />* If you’re not interested in pagemaking, perhaps the policy area is of interest. Take a look at the Governance process and Appropriate content pages. These are key to the wiki’s success. If we get these areas right, there’s a good likelihood we’ll succeed.<br /><br />* Finally, if you’ve got an idea or a gripe, I’m reachable via the below.<br /><br />* Final, final. If none of this appeals to you, forward this to a friend who might be interested.<br /><br /><strong>The Future</strong><br /><br />The wiki is part of the Jackson Heights Initiative. It was begun by Connecting.nyc Inc., a NYS nonprofit that emerged from a community board 3 resolution passed in 2001. Connecting.nyc applied for and received the city’s license to operate the JacksonHeights.nyc domain. Our goal is to get the wiki and related digital resources in operation, (e.g., the JacksonHeights.nyc website), and transition control to a locally controlled nonprofit within the next couple of years.<br /><br />The JacksonHeights.nyc website is not ready for viewing yet, remaining in the unimproved state in which we received it from the city. Our next message will focus on plans for it. Until then, share your knowledge on the wiki.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />Director, Connecting.nyc Inc.<br /><br />Interim Director, JacksonHeights.nyc<br /><br /><a href="mailto:Tom@connecting.nyc" class="bbc_email">Tom@connecting.nyc</a><br /><br />Connecting.nyc<br /><br />Jackson Hts., NYC<br /><br />718 639 4222<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"></span></span><div align="center">The Jackson Heights wiki: <a href="https://wiki.JacksonHeights.nyc" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://wiki.JacksonHeights.nyc</a>.</div>[/size][/size]<br /><br />

					Neighbors,<br /><br />For some time I&#039;ve been considering the utility of a JacksonHeights.nyc domain name. I say &quot;some time&quot; because it emerged from an April 19, 2001 resolution by Community Board 3 to acquire the .nyc TLD (like .com and org but just for New Yorkers). First we needed .nyc and then we could develop our neighborhood name. <br /><br />A lots happened in the meantime (Facebook, cell phones, JHLife...) and the form of its developed remains an open question. I&#039;ve put together a draft application for the name (it will be licensed by the city to local non-profit for a 3 years term) with many areas ripe for comment. See the draft here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MgWNGM7fTeKqDMbtej-2GsYA1gL0jHZ2DSvjoHA8pHA/edit?usp=sharing" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MgWNGM7fTeKqDMbtej-2GsYA1gL0jHZ2DSvjoHA8pHA/edit?usp=sharing</a>.<br /><br />You&#039;ll excuse the hit and run, but I&#039;ll be out of town for several days. But its 20 pages or so and will probably require a little time to get through. <br /><br />I&#039;ll be here and around the neighborhood (I&#039;m going to set up a table to gather face to face comments) in the coming weeks. <br /><br />Looking forward to your thoughts.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br /><a href="mailto:toml@communisphere.com" class="bbc_email">toml@communisphere.com</a>

					This is fairly weird. This morning I was composing the below email which I sent a bit ago to the JHFamilies list. Afterward I said to myself - why don&#039;t I post it on jacksonheightslife as well. And guess what I found? Two contextual notes: Patti works a full room away from me and I obviously don&#039;t know all of what she&#039;s up to. Second, she was one of the mentors at P.S. 69 that I refer to in the below.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom<br /><br />P.S. Hi Patti&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Here&#039;s my letter from JHFamalies<br />-----------------------<br />Neighbors,<br /><br />The Queens World Film Festival <a href="http://queensworldfilmfestival.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queensworldfilmfestival.com</a> is in full swing with 177 films being shown this week in Astoria, Long Island City and here in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Overall the festival is doing quite well with the films in Astoria and LIC attracting decent crowds - 150 attended a film at the Museum of the Moving Image Wednesday, and 75% of the seats were filled at the Big Secret Theater in LIC. Here in JH it&#039;s being held at P.S. 69.<br /><br />I attended the 8 PM block at P.S. 69 on Wednesday and saw a great film, Coming Back To The Hoop - stream it. The director, Jane Pittman, who&#039;d flown in from Virginia, took questions.<br /><br />As a neighborhood booster there was one downer, I was was surprised to see how few neighbors were in attendance. If we don&#039;t support the festival it will move to a more arts friendly neighborhood and we&#039;ll bemoan the fact that we don&#039;t have one here. [By the way, on Wednesday morning, at P.S. 69, a by-product of the festival took place. The 5th grade class showed 4 films made by students, with the assistance of QWFF mentors. And, for the first time ever, one of the films was edited by a <br />student. Yup, a 5th grader edited a film.]<br /><br />Let&#039;s keep the festival here. Attend a film tonight. They start at 6:30 and go past midnight. There will be 3 &quot;blocks&quot; of films: starting at: 6:30 2 films, 8:15 5 films, 10:00 6 films. And there are films all day tomorrow - noon to 6 pm<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt

					Neighbors,<br /><br />The city has set aside 385 neighborhood names for use by &quot;community groups to develop new online hubs for civic engagement, online organizing and information-sharing.&quot;<br /><br />To be eligible for the JacksonHeights.nyc name &quot;the lead organization must meet the following minimum qualifications: (a) registered as a not-for-profit, public benefit corporation or local development corporation, and (b) located within the neighborhood for which a .nyc domain name is sought.&quot; For more on this see the city&#039;s official dotNeighborhoods site at <a href="http://neighborhoods.nyc" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://neighborhoods.nyc</a>. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see a &quot;heavy on the wiki&quot; type JacksonHeights.nyc site, perhaps like that used in David, California (<a href="http://daviswiki.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://daviswiki.org/</a>). That&#039;s a college town, and I&#039;m not certain it would work for a neighborhood. But it promotes civic engagement and enables comprehensiveness. Additionally, the utility of the site for local advertising is critical if it&#039;s to be self-sustaining. That&#039;s a design and business model question probably best worked out on a city-wide basis. (I like a Major League Baseball-like model with the strong supporting the weak).<br /><br />Background: .nyc domain names were first sold mid-2014, with 60,000 sold so far. The prototype dotNeighborhoods are likely to be Dumbo.nyc and LongIslandCity.nyc. They are thought to be technically strong and not in Manhattan.<br /><br />JacksonHeightsLife.com and the JH Families list do a great job. The tentative plans call for providing prominent exposure for existing neighborhood entities. But I&#039;m not sure what happens to them if a state-of-the-art JacksonHeights.nyc site thrives as part of a city-wide effort. Frankly, I&#039;d imagine usage would decline. <br /><br />But putting on my cynics hat I fear that, if we do nothing, an alternative plan will soon be put forward saying &quot;We have the resources to make this happen fast, in a way that will benefit all the neighborhoods, and the taxpayers. Give those names to us.&quot; These people will become our new kings. They&#039;ll control the home page. They won&#039;t develop all neighborhoods. And the dotNeighborhood names will have gone to waste. Worse, it will further scatter local attention.<br /><br />I&#039;m for dotNeighborhoods that are locally controlled, and that facilitate robust information sharing, decision making, and organizing. With there capabilities I believe we can provide better governance for our neighborhood than ever before.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like to pursue this, let me know and I&#039;ll set up a meeting for mid-January.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Tom Lowenhaupt<br />75th Street<br /><br />
