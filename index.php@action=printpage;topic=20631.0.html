				Today, Sunday, August 8, 2021, there&#039;s a parade on Northern from 69th St. to 86th St. and I believe it&#039;s closed to car traffic from 11 am to 4 pm (not exactly sure of the time). Also today is the usual Open Streets program so 34th Ave is closed to car traffic from 8 am to 8 pm.<br /><br />The 115th had initially announced a few days ago that they would open 34th Ave to cars from 9 am to 3 pm, but then they changed their minds. <br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on driving a car, getting a car service, getting a delivery or taking a bus, be advised it could take longer.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/lELM0Ac.png)

				Traffic on 35th Avenue is pretty much at a standstill.&nbsp; If there is some emergency or delivery blocking the street, this potentially can be dangerous or a honking nightmare.&nbsp; This shows the true stupidity of 115th precinct, community board and leadership in this community.

				I dunno, I live on 35th Avenue and so get a front-row seat to the gridlock. Most of the cars are private vehicles with just one person inside (the driver). Seems that if there&#039;s concern about emergency vehicle and delivery access, the place to start would be there.

So it was not just private cars with single drivers that were impacted.

Is it crowd size?<br /><br />Given that there&#039;s an Open Street now a block away from parade routes, and that DoT hasn&#039;t decided to shut down the OS during parades, maybe Northern isn&#039;t such a great location.<br /><br />
