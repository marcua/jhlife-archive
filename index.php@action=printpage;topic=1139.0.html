				Speaking of Japanese food, does anybody know of a place around that serves ochazuke (http://www.justhungry.com/2004/01/ochazuke_rice_w.html)?&nbsp; It&#039;s a very simple rice, fish, and green tea soup -- amazingly delicious.<br /><br />Whenever I&#039;m in DC, I order it at Teaism (http://www.teaism.com/).&nbsp; They have a great way of serving it... a pot of green tea, an empty tea cup, and a bowl with all of the ingredients for ochazuke minus the broth.&nbsp; You get to apportion the green tea between the bowl and the cup according to your tastes.<br /><br />Has anybody seen any place serving something like this in our area?

				Todd, I&#039;ve had ochazuke at Zenkichi in Brooklyn.&nbsp; It&#039;s not served the traditional way with dashi stock.&nbsp; It was just green tea mixed with the rice.&nbsp; Still good though.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Just to put in my 2 cents about authenticity, since I am a self-proclaimed sushi snob- the authentic Japanese restaurants take the effort to season their rice according to the fish that&#039;s going on top of it.&nbsp; For example, some fish pair well with rice that has more vinegar in it.&nbsp; Other fish pair well with a dab of wasabi embedded in the rice.&nbsp; Sushi also isn&#039;t supposed to be a huge hunk of fish hanging off the rice on either end.&nbsp; The fish is supposed to be in proportion to the rice so that they are eaten together in one bite.&nbsp; Yes, one bite!&nbsp; Also, soy sauce isn&#039;t necessary for fresh sushi, it&#039;s actually frowned upon, but if you want to use it, you should be dunking the fish (turn sushi upside down) in the sauce, not the rice.&nbsp; I learned some of this in Japan and some of it just going to the great shrines of sushidom in Manhattan (Sushi Yasuda).&nbsp;

				Oops.&nbsp; Hubby just pointed out an error in my response to Todd.&nbsp; The salmon soup at Zenkichi had dashi broth instead of green tea, so no, it&#039;s really not ochazuke.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m knowledgeable on sushi, but not cooked Japanese food.&nbsp; &nbsp;My bad.&nbsp; :P

				toddg, I think you&#039;re going to need to find a good kaiseki if you want ochazuke (not likely.)&nbsp; It&#039;s just not really an izakaya staple.&nbsp; Back in my drinking days, ochazuke helped me through many hangovers.&nbsp; Good luck.

				Sugiyama and a few other restaurants in Manhattan do kaiseki but it can be quite expensive.<br /><br />On a related note, since we are looking for obscure dishes- has anyone had authentic Kobe beef in the city?&nbsp; I keep coming across what is termed Kobe-style, which can mean anything from American cattle being massaged and fed beer to something even less genuine like marbled beef with no pedigree.&nbsp; I had the honor of having Kobe beef in where else...Kobe a few years back and I&#039;ve been spoiled for life!&nbsp; I know there was a ban on Kobe beef imports but I heard it was then lifted.&nbsp; Where are the imported Kobe beef being served?&nbsp; And I mean that they have to be able to show me the Japanese certificate of authenticity on the beef, which is what the chef did in Kobe.

				Right after I win the lottery, I&#039;ll make sure I get myself to a kaiseki place ASAP.<br /><br />But I hope I don&#039;t have to wait until then to find some ochazuke.&nbsp; It&#039;s as simple and unpretentious as food gets.&nbsp; I order it at a D.C. tea shop, where no cooking (other than rice steaming and water boiling) is required.<br /><br />

				Or really, you could just make it yourself.&nbsp; There really isn&#039;t an easier dish to make in all of Japanese cuisine (with possibly the exception of Miso Soup).<br /><br />Step 1) make rice (of course you&#039;ll want japanese short grain rice for that clumpy txture :D )<br />Step 2) make tea (bancha/Houjicha... maybe Genmaicha... normal sencha and other GREEN green teas are a bit too fancy for this dish.)<br />Step 3) add toppings to rice... toasted nori (just hold it over a flame for a few seconds), wasabi or even a dab of hot mustard,green onions (of course!).&nbsp; These are basics.&nbsp; plus you can put a couple small pieces of white fish in, or cod-roe, or even some fresh tuna sashimi if you can get your hands on the really good stuff. (though seems like a waste of good sashimi to put it in a hardy dish like this).<br /><br />Step 4) Mix and EAT.&nbsp; :smitten:<br /><br /><br />for anyone interested in classic Japanese cooking I can recommend this book:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Cooking-Simple-Shizuo-Tsuji/dp/4770030495/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214602945&amp;sr=8-1<br /><br />It reads almost like a text book, and contains a wealth of knowledge on technique/recipes/terminology etc.<br />
