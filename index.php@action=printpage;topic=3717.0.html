				... when you can recall that phone numbers like 672 were NR2 ...<br /><br />... when everybody went to PS 69, from 69th Street to 88th Street ...<br /><br />... ditto IS 145, all the way to Corona ...<br /><br />... (and all the 6th graders fit in one trailer) ...<br /><br />... Travers Park was just called the 77th Street Park (ironic the playstreet is on 78th, but I still think of the park as the old 77th) ...<br /><br />... the local precinct was the 110th before we earned enough crime stats to get the 115th ...<br /><br />... trains had double letters and the N was the R or RR or whatever ...<br /><br />... the old lady upstairs when you were a kid was alive in the 19th century (truly!) ...<br /><br />... the only Halloween parade was running from the park in a line before the major craziness began ...<br /><br />... people sat on milk crates and folding chairs just off 37th Avenue (there was no internet then!) ...<br /><br />... everyone roller skated at USA ...<br /><br />ah nostalgia ... I&#039;m in that mood I guess<br /><br />

				Being a relative &#039;newbie&#039; - only 11 years - am curious - what did the NR in the phone number stand for?&nbsp; I grew up in the FI section of Queens - which stood for Fieldstone.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Can&#039;t find it on google ...<br /><br />But I did find that Wikipedia had this in its article on Elmhurst:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>&quot;When the British took over New Netherland in 1664, they renamed Middleburgh as New Town (Nieuwe Stad) to maintain the Dutch heritage. This was eventually simplified to Newtown. Among the English settlers in the present Elmhurst section of Newtown was Gershom Moore, in whose orchard a chance seedling produced the Newtown Pippin, Colonial America&#039;s most famous apple. Newtown was established as the Town Seat for the Township of the same name when it was established in 1683. The village was renamed Elmhurst (Lep Hurst)[citation needed] in 1896 to identify the area with a new housing development, avoid association with the larger Township, and the Creek, and maintain the Dutch heritage.&quot;</em></span>

				A quick search on old New York City telephone exchanges revealed the following site.&nbsp; It lists a few of the exchanges that were used in Jackson Heights, in addition to other areas of New York and nationwide.&nbsp; If the link doesn&#039;t take you directly to the results for Jackson Heights, just plug in the info in the boxes to view the listing.&nbsp; By the way, the site took some time to load on my laptop.<br /><br />Telephone EXchange Project (http://rcrowe.brinkster.net/tensearch.aspx)

				You know that you&#039;ve been here too long when you can trace your Sunday mornings back to Wexler&#039;s for lox and bagels.&nbsp; When after school meant hash browns at the Toddle House, a hot dog and a knish at a kosher deli or two slices and a coke for 25 cents at the local pizza places.&nbsp; When school graduation was held in a movie theater that is now a Latino restaurant.&nbsp; When you remember the &quot;new&quot; Toy City opening on Roosevelt Avenue.
