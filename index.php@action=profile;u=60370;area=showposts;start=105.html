					I completely agree with you Eddie. But something I think a lot of people weigh more heavily is having an elevator and good proximity to the express train. I know in my JH apartment search it has been a constant struggle prioritizing price vs those two conveniences. <br /><br />This concept of &quot;aging in place&quot; is something I think a lot about. I currently live in a five floor walk up. I am surrounded by people of all ages (literally 30-90!) that have difficulty with the stairs..even on lower floors. I had also recently spoken with a person that lives in Linden Court that regretted buying on the second floor 30-odd years ago. They weren&#039;t even 60 yet! Things like that can tip the scale and make people pony up more cash..especially if they are in it for the long haul. Just my two cents...

					I saw a thread about this topic from March-October 2015 and wanted to revive it.&nbsp; Anyone out there ever made a claim to their co-op insurance before with an issue specifically about their apartment? What carrier do you have? Good experience or bad?<br /><br />In the old thread people talk about requirements from their co-op but I am only aware of the 500K liability stipulation in our situation. Any thoughts, insights or recommendations for companies I should look into..even if you haven&#039;t made a claim? Good customer service, etc?<br /><br />Thank you!

					Wondering if any of you can recommend licensed, insured and high quality floor refinishing service providers that you have used somewhat recently in pre-war co-ops in JH?<br /><br />Seeking to get a quote for the typical sanding (or screening)/stain/water based polyurethane option. <br /><br />I am also hoping to find someone who also has experience and success applying hardwax oils (specifically Pallmann Magic Oil) as an alternative to poly. (We&#039;d be more than happy to hear about quality outfits that only do stain/ W-B Poly too...not a deal breaker as we are still deciding.)<br /><br />Anyone out there try the Pallmann Magic Oil approach? Any comments about how that experience has been for you? I have heard it can be a bit temperamental to apply at first so finding an experienced professional is essential.<br /><br />Thank you!

					Let me preface this by saying I do not yet live in JHs. And I have no idea what your budget is for two-three bedroom. But I&#039;ve been looking at one bedrooms quite a bit since the start of the year and I really liked Colonial Court...an elevator building. Yes it was built in 1940 so is it pre-war? That is borderline. Spaces seem to be a good value for the maintenance. Great location.<br /><br />Now do I live there? No I don&#039;t. And I have not yet seen a three bedroom listed there at all. The two bedrooms look pretty nice.

					Thank you CaptainFlannel for giving me hope that Fios is still possible in various parts of JH. I guess this Verizon salesperson just wanted to sell me on the HSI quickly. Regardless, I am confident that I will jettison TWC at my first opportunity. They are the worst! I really hope you all can find the best way to convey your displeasure about their shoddy service and find a speedy resolution to your issues.

					I was on the phone with Verizon yesterday re: JH Fios. I haven&#039;t had time to fact check my agent&#039;s statement..but what I was told was if your building was wired for Fios then you can still get that activated. However if your building isn&#039;t yet wired it never will be. That product was discontinued because it was too costly to install. That same agent told me that Fios service is very expensive too ...something like $200/month. That sounds obscenely high. I have to wonder if he meant that include cable TV too. Any Fios customers care to chime in?<br /><br />This rep heaped praise on another product of theirs HSI or High Speed Internet. He said HSI has a dedicated line where TWC&#039;s line is shared by several companies..slowing down service.&nbsp; Anyone on here have Verizon for internet? Any thoughts about price and quality?&nbsp; Any comparisons on TWC vs Verizon (and/or FIOS) if you switched within JHs? Thanks!

					Hmm am I crazy or were their posts on this topic that came after the 31st that are now missing? I have my old one ( I think from the 2nd?) so I will repost.&nbsp; Anyone else have their old messages?<br /><br />My previous, super long message: <br /><br />What an incredibly helpful conversation. Thanks to you all for your feedback. I am adding Leesa to my list of ones to check out. <br /><br />Shelby2, So have you fully committed to S&amp;F brand? Also can I ask, was the bed you slept on at your friends&#039; place in their primary sleeping space or in a second bedroom? <br /><br />I am reluctant to try and sway you but ours was a truly terrible experience. What we found was basically when you run into trouble with a large mattress maker there is this test used to prove if what you have is defective. It is a joke. Without allowing you to lay on it at the same time, this person supposedly comes out to measure the depth of the indentation. If it is more than 1.5 inches deep they will replace it. Otherwise sorry charlie. I didn&#039;t go through myself because I didn&#039;t want to pay the fee for their visit. Without my weight on it I couldn&#039;t get that measurement so why would they. But man, was this thing unbearably uncomfortable. After owning it for only 18 months I found myself waking night after night, half of my body falling asleep because of my trough. We felt we had little choice but to dump it and go with a cheaper Ikea one to get us though. Thankfully that thing has been a champ for the past 2 years. And for the record my husband and I are both of average weight for our heights so that did not factor in creating this issue. We also had this placed on a box spring on a frame, not a slat or platform bed or on the floor..so not sure how that factored in as well.<br /><br />Also as a sidebar Stearns &amp; Foster and Bassett are both owned by Sealy. It could stand to reason that the quality of those three brands is comparable despite premium pricing. Something else to consider perhaps?<br /><br />Before my Sterns and Foster debacle I had a lovely (I think it was) Serta that I bought over the phone from 1-800-mattress. It was the very cheapest sized queen bed on offer. That thing held up amazingly well for over 15 years. Who knows what that brand&#039;s quality has become over the years. But it sure was great while it lasted.<br /><br />One last thing: What I find most maddening is how the major bands now exclusively make one sided mattresses (irrespective of pillow top or not). So they are no longer are flippable. Basically that seems like you are shaving off half the useful life. Anyone come across a brand that is still made two sided? Please share. I&#039;d gladly go down that old tech path and add my own pillow top or memory foam mattress topper. Let&#039;s face it this process is not so fun..so I want to find something good and have it last at least a decade.

					I am very interested in this feedback as well. I have had a few recommendations for tuft and needle but I have no personal experience. They are primarily a mail order outfit so not being able to try them out could be a strike against them? <br /><a href="https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/</a><br /><br />I am curious about Casper which looks like it has a showroom on Bond st. in NoHo. Anyone out there have any feedback about either of those? <br /><br />We had a terrible experience with a pricey pillow topped Sterns and Foster purchased at a Sleepy&#039;s. It lasted only a year and a half before developing uncomfortable troughs despite regular rotation. More about these issues in general here: <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/furniture/stearns_foster.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.consumeraffairs.com/furniture/stearns_foster.html</a><br /><br />After that we went with one of the cheapest Ikea mattresses with two egg crate type foam toppers from BBB. Part of the overall trouble is that several of the major brands are made by the same manufacturer. Consumer reports also seems to do impartial evaluations of these each year so perhaps that could help. Not sure if this info is available for free online or not.<br />
