				The furry love of our lives died a few months ago and although we are still devastated&nbsp; we are ready to open our home to another dog. We miss walking/grooming/playing/loving a dog. We are looking for a bigger dog (no teacups for us) a&nbsp; mutt (like us) is fabulous. We do have cats and kids. We have experience with a variety of animals (we&#039;ve rescued quite a few over the years) and use a local vet whom I am sure will provide a reference for us. We would like a younger dog/puppy (we cant go through anymore loss this year) So if you have or know someone who has a dog. It would have home cooked meals, sleep in bed with us. go to the park/daily&nbsp; multiple walks and interact with all of our friends dogs/play ball and just be loved. let me know thanks

				Hunnybear, <br /><br />Sorry to hear about your loss.&nbsp; I know how bad it feels to lose your dog.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(&nbsp; They are like a member of the family.<br /><br />I have met several people in the neighborhood who have adopted from North Shore Animal League.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; Here is their puppy page:<br /><br />http://www.nsalamerica.org/adopt/puppies/<br /><br />Also, we adopted a two year old dog (a mutt) who we have had for five years now and just adore him.&nbsp; I would absolutely do that again.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have to go through the teething, housebreaking etc... And we knew what we were getting personality and energy-level wise.<br /><br />Good luck to you.&nbsp; Your new pup will be very fortunate.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think pit bulls are beautiful dogs.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame they&#039;ve gotten bad reputations from bad owners.&nbsp; But I know there are differing opinions on them.&nbsp; I wonder if there&#039;s such a thing as &quot;a bad dog&quot;?&nbsp; Anyway, good luck with finding Dubby a home.<br /><br />I&#039;m one of those &quot;teacup&quot; people! :-)&nbsp; Plus a lot of those breeds (poodles, bichons) have hair which are great for people, like me, with allergies to fur/dander.&nbsp;

				I just recently adopted a pitbull mix from a no kill shelter - Animal Haven.&nbsp; They have locations in Flushing &amp; Soho.<br /><br />http://www.animalhavenshelter.org/<br /><br />This is the dog we just adopted:&nbsp; http://ah.convio.net/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5127&amp;security=1062&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1022<br /><br />She&#039;s currently dog aggressive, so we&#039;ve been working with a trainer to reduce the dog aggression.&nbsp; Otherwise, she&#039;s getting settled into our home and is the best pet at home... very obedient and already house trained.
