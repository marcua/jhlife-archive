					&nbsp;Thanks Lochezia! Just back from the woodshed - do you know this term? Or the wonderful book<br />by a former JH Towers resident and stellar painter, Jack Whitten*? It&#039;s where you do the ruminating<br />and thinking and reforming of ideas after having them percolate for awhile in your head. One thing<br />that I can&#039;t figure out as I pass it on 34th ave at the 69th Street BQE overpass is a new bike rack.<br />This is a god forsaken area and no one in their right mind is parking their bike in this bird crap laden<br />area! But we know the DOT are not savvy about lower JH and have made some utterly ridiculous <br />statements like there are no bike lanes anywhere around here...hello 31st Ave beautiful bike lane.<br />&nbsp; So a new bike rack for the Open Street group, I imagine, a few yards from the other two bike racks<br />in front of the new school (which are barely used) and sadly, no bike rack for IS230 a few blocks up <br />the street! What gives with these people? Please explain the random bike rack dropping, someone?<br /><br />&nbsp; *https://shop.hauserwirth.com/products/jack-whitten-notes-from-the-woodshed

					&nbsp;Very sad this week to see how seniors have to squeeze their 34th Ave front door pick up needs into the 1 1/2 hour street cleaning schedules. But hey we need street closures 13 hours a day, 365 and seniors are on their way out, right? Communities who have fought for inclusivity are getting fed up! It&#039;s too much time particularly in the winter months like now.<br />&nbsp; Those that live right next to or above outdoor dining are having had it too. Maybe we can join forces to find the right way to expand that is inclusive of all residents needs.Waking up to poop in your doorway sounds awful (see below) but where do folks go to the bathroom on 34th Ave, dare we ask?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/nyregion/outdoor-dining-nyc.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/nyregion/outdoor-dining-nyc.html</a><br />

					&nbsp;Have you ever been on Roosevelt Ave or 37th Ave when the South American Leagues are playing? Or in Astoria when Greece&#039;s team is competitive? Or in Woodside when the Ted Lasso&#039;s type leagues are playing? Flushing Meadows any day of the week playing lots of games next to the hulking tennis and baseball stadiums. Hiding in plain sight is one way to look at it. Seriously, go check out some games. Ted Lasso is such a fun show!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;As an immigrant community for decades, Queen&#039;s has an enormous soccer base. The US&nbsp; hasn&#039;t figured out how to monetize the sport yet but a number of professional athletes here have become owners of soccer clubs elsewhere. And not for nothing, moms seem to love their boys and girls playing soccer over many other choices now! Outdoors, lots of running, many different positions, frequent substitutions, lots of playfulness, less head injuries. We even drove past a boys on one side/girls across the street games in a rural farming area a few weeks ago that you would assume was football but no - soccer!

					&nbsp;Am looking at Sunnyside and their attempts to put these diverters in. Today was a disaster with a tractor trailer stuck in the narrow streets around the Doughboy park snarling traffic and the DOT construction crews - in every direction. Really god awful traffic with people driving in reverse up the streets and on the sidewalks. People should think long and hard here on the impact to the entire neighborhood. Skillman Ave is the wrong ave to change and I think 34th is not the best choice here but let the planners present their assessments post Covid.<br />&nbsp;As for teachers parking in JH - yes, it&#039;s extremely important and should be a high priority but the DOE should participate in the local planning. They have built a number of new schools with next to no parking accommodations for facilities that educate 7,000. kids! Why not have the lottery system that many schools do? BTW Cambridge is one of many popular urban areas that needed to resort to parking permits for locals along with a bunch of other in Boston and Phila and DC that I am aware of.

					&nbsp;Many of us would LOVE to have parking permits as policy in Jackson Heights. So many spots are used by non-residents, contractors, most of the teachers in our many schools, for example, come from other areas denying those folks who live here the access they need. <br />This would go a long way in helping those that need their vehicles for any number of reasons to apply for local permits and pay those fees. LOVE this!<br /><br />

					&nbsp;Oh yes, I&#039;ve been here all along. And the Diversity Plaza renovations were hijacked by a group purporting to represent the whole community- all of JH, commuters, residents, business owners and non-business owners- should have been part of the planning. But it did not end up being representative of the community at large in my opinion. The business community took over. Was it worse before the millions were spent? Not every one thinks so. The cars were a problem, yes, but the traffic only got thrown to one side - the right hand side headed towards Roosevelt- creating a weird traffic area there.<br />&nbsp; Also the lack of thru traffic has some shady business going on with more sex traffic and suspect businesses that were not there before. It&#039;s a shame because at one point not that long ago this lower end of Jackson Heights seemed to be a promising retail and restaurant area. The block on Roosevelt between 73rd and 72nd seems to have taken the hardest hit.&nbsp; There are some fine restaurants sprinkled in but the area as a whole is seedier now than I have ever seen before. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;What might be a solution? There needs to be a diverse group of businesses, I think, that will have a variety of clientele and different merchandise and be open staggered hours. A cafe that has a good handle on its outdoor seating, smaller kiosks in an organized fashion would be nice. Near Madison Park on 23rd street in Manhattan, the city has done a good job of limiting the food vendors and have places to sit and throw your garbage which is cleaned often.The trash and garbage collection on 73rd is awful now and worse than before the traffic changes. This is a fear for 34th Ave too because changes making vehicular access more difficult tend to result in reduced services for all. The rat scene at Diversity Plaza is unreal!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, not progress in my opinion and all that money just for raising the sidewalk to the level of the street? Why? And for gods sake let&#039;s not let that hijacking happen again. Collect<br />data, feel the temp of the whole neighborhood post Covid and see what consensus and professional planners can deliver.

					&nbsp;The difference between anyplace in Manhattan and the outer boroughs is easy transit options for all ages and mobility. Many people here in JH are in need of some kind of transit- car service, delivery of goods, school buses, company vehicles, etc- to live their lives. The 12hr -NO WAIT 13 HR!!- closures are not conducive to those on 34th Ave, and now the immediately surrounding residences to having a quality of life that they did prior to Open Streets. Sounds like the legal challenges are, in some cases, requesting payouts similar to those with the school construction sites to nearby residents affected.<br />&nbsp;Even today, on a Sunday, there were times in the 13 hours with little to no usage. Also the chaos that is motorcycles/e-bikes/speeding cyclists in the free for all on 34th Ave, is losing appeal to many of those who were formerly fans of OS. And while we are at it, bring back the bike lane, say many! Restore sanity with a designated bike lane, the kind we used to have for decades prior.<br />&nbsp;Does Transportation Alternatives support losing our beloved 34th bike lane? If the &quot;whites on bikes&quot; who are said to be pushing OS in other communities aware of this loss? Let&#039;s see what the winter brings with usage and this spring DOT construction if it happens. Nothing can be worse than Diversity Plaza when it comes to local planning here. Or maybe we can hit a new<br />low...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

					&nbsp;It seems that loving Open Streets has a lot to do with if you live on vs. near 34th Ave. Most of the on the ave residents are less than thrilled at the 12hr a day, seven days a week closures. Intervention is needed here! Please electeds, those new and seasoned, can you relieve some of the stresses this causes for those that have legit reasons to want their access back for some of the time here? <br />&nbsp; Not everyone loves this situation. Not by a long stretch.

					&nbsp;Sad not to have either Maya Wiley or Kathryn Garcia. But there&#039;s next time...and just asking Shekar to bring us the much needed community center and to clean the very filthy diversity plaza. Today it was at an all time worst. Can&#039;t go much further down.

					<em>The Broadway to Northern Blvd. divided bike lane was installed and lasted about two weeks last year when it was demolished by traffic needing that space. If lawbreaking vandals wantonly destroy public safety equipment on roads, then they should be arrested and criminally charged. Next time build it out of concrete.</em><br /><br />&nbsp;The funny thing here is that is was not likely that anyone purposely meant to destroy it. But the volume of construction vehicles, trucks and cars of all types is so high in that area near the BQE that it was knocked over and then smashed to bits very quickly. These plastic dividers don&#039;t hold up in high traffic areas. Concrete is fine by me but the loss of traffic lanes when biking is not as common here or as feasible in winter months means that the surge goes elsewhere and creates new headaches on a different street. We desperately need a full environmental review for the area. The fact that some of the blocks affected here also had major flooding recently and that is not being recognized shows that it&#039;s not one size fits all for our local streets and any closures or bike lanes. Sunnyside is strongly fighting back and we&#039;ll see how they fare with regard to unusual forced street closures and bike lanes.

					&nbsp;What a contentious project! Really needs a long review by professionals with lot&#039;s of data because this plan is not what satisfies both parties who live/work/go to school on 34th Ave. It may be possible this was just put out to start a discussion and is far, far from anything that could be considered permanent. The Broadway to Northern Blvd. divided bike lane was installed and lasted about two weeks last year when it was demolished by traffic needing that space. I believe this design would have a similar fate. Chingwa called it!
