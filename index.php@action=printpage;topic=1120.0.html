				Jackson Heights is getting a new park!<br /><br />City planners met with administration and students at I.S. 145 yesterday.&nbsp; My source (one of my 7th graders who participated in the meeting) said that the the planners discussed building new basketball and handball courts, synthetic grass soccer and baseball fields, benches, fountains, and plants (including trees along Northern Blvd. to block traffic noise).&nbsp; The new schoolyard will be closed when school is in session, then open to the community when school is not in session (after 4:00 PM, weekends, and vacations).&nbsp; While the schoolyard isn&#039;t huge, this project will probably double the amount of field space in the neighborhood.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to find out more, including the time line for the project from the Principal today.

				That sounds amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I just realized I was thinking of the wrong school so am editing my post. This is the school at 80th Street not 74th.&nbsp; I guess they&#039;re going to revamp their cement exterior????<br /><br />Definitely tell your 7th grader to report back as much as possible.&nbsp; We love knowing this stuff.

				Thanks for the great news, Mr. C!<br /><br />This is certainly tremendously needed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it&#039;s wonderful that your school&#039;s students are being consulted... I hope their input is being taken seriously, because our community is severely lacking in social and recreational spaces geared for that age group.&nbsp; But FYI, there are some emerging environmental health concerns about synthetic turf that the school should investigate before proceeding with this.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are also two very active park advocacy groups in the community (JH Green and Friends of Travers Park) who I&#039;m sure would love an opportunity to be briefed on the project.

				This is in keeping with the previously announced Mayoral plan of turning school yards into parks. A while back someone posted a PDF of the city plan. The first one in Brooklyn was covered on TV. What a great idea.<br /><br />Mr. C. how have your ideas for gardens been going?

				This is great news, and a great step forward for JH. <br /><br />Though, cynically, I will note that in most cities other than NYC this is how it&#039;s always been (free public access to schoolyards). It&#039;s a little humorous to me that we&#039;re lauding this as a visionary move when in fact there are millions of schools in the rest of the country where this is already the case. In any event, go Mike.<br /><br />

				I&#039;d like to add my gratitude to IS 145 for their participation in this initiative.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a win-win for the school&#039;s students (both during and after school hours) and the rest of the community.<br /><br />The P.S. 69 Parents Association had quite a different reaction to the Mayor&#039;s proposal to open their playground, circulating a petition last June that said &quot;This could attract Drugs, Gang Activity, Violence, Graffiti, Vandelism, The Homeless, Strangers, and Child Molestors to a space very close to our children.&nbsp; Making the space unsafe for our kids.&quot;&nbsp; Quite an appalling and counterproductive viewpoint, in my opinion.&nbsp; (Maybe we should shut down all of the playgrounds!)

				This project is finally moving forward!<br /><br />Jackson Heights 11372 (http://jacksonheights11372.blogspot.com/2011/10/big-changes-at-pulitzer-school.html) has an update on this, with a high-resolution photo of the sign showing what the completed project will look like.&nbsp; The city did a great job with P.S. 69, so I&#039;m looking forward to seeing this come to fruition.
