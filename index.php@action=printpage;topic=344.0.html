				I&#039;d swear there are more dogs and cats in my building than people.<br /><br />These are mine.<br /><br />This is Frankie. He is a 7 year old, neutered Bichon Frise. He was named for Frank Sinatra. In fact I registered him under the name FranÃ§ois AlbÃ©rt. Hey, he&#039;s a French breed I thought he should have a French name! He is such an alpha male. I swear I will never have another male, ever again. I had heard about these alphas, but it is another thing to have to live with one. <br />(http://farm1.static.flickr.com/230/480959144_446bb29039.jpg?v=0)<br /><br />This is Frieda Antonia. Named after my grandmothers, she is a 5 year old, spayed, uncropped, undocked Affenpinscher. She is a classic terrier: bossy and one can short of a six-pack! Her favorite toy is a mirror so she can bark at the image of the dog who won&#039;t play with her! Her favorite place is the threshold to the kitchen waiting for something to drop.<br />(http://farm1.static.flickr.com/66/163972313_c8ce503c42.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Okay, I showed you mine, now show me yours.

				O.K., a bit off topic, but just wanted to give a shout out to Jeanne McCaffrey and her Syberian Husky, Lacey.&nbsp; Both were in attendance as spectators at the Westminster Dog Show this week and received a mention in the Queens Courier.&nbsp; For those that may not have met Jeanne, she is the sister of John McCaffrey, president of the JHBG.&nbsp; She also happens to be a great friend of ours!&nbsp; <br /><br />Way to go Jeanne and Lacey!<br /><br />http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2008/02/13/news/local/news09.txt

				You are so not a geek. You are a pet person. I love people who share their love with another species. They are pretty special people. I don&#039;t trust people who hate dogs and cats. Why would anyone want to close themselves off from the irrevocable love of anything? What is the pup&#039;s name, age, gender, breed, and what part of the bed does he/she sleep on?

				&nbsp;;D&nbsp; thanks for the kind words.<br /><br />Casey is a 4 year old male that I rescued from a breeder in Conn. who just didn&#039;t love him.&nbsp; Per her words: &quot;He needs more attention than I&#039;m willing to give him.&nbsp; Oh and he&#039;s been dropped twice and has had two broken legs.&quot;<br /><br />I WAS HORRIFIED!&nbsp; Maybe once, I&#039;ll give her, but twice!!!&nbsp; I just kept my big mouth shut cuz I wanted him and I didn&#039;t want her to change her mind.&nbsp; His teeth were covered in tartar, which I had cleaned during his neutering.<br /><br />Now he&#039;s a Prince among dogs: lying next to me on the sofa (he&#039;s a cuddle bug) and sleeps on my bed at night.&nbsp; He loves driving in the car which cracks me up.<br /><br />

				This guy&#039;s nickname is Stud Muffin, although he definitely prefers wrestling and running to flirting and seducing (but then again, he&#039;s still young!)&nbsp; Here he is sleeping off a particularly athletic bout with one of his favorite toys, which is just about anything he can get his paws on!<br /><br />P.S. Buddy, I&#039;m happy to report the Persian is nearly mat free.&nbsp; I took him in to my vet, who ignored all the vicious howling and just gave him a good combing.&nbsp; Thanks again for your concern!

				He&#039;s really a pretty kitty, isn&#039;t he?&nbsp; I grew up in a house with both cats and dogs.&nbsp; Thought I&#039;d always have both but somewhere I developed allergies to cats so it&#039;s just a poodle for me.&nbsp; I miss having a cat though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how people can&#039;t like them... they&#039;re so funny to watch!<br /><br />Next photo: the persian.

				Miss Chatelaine, he is such a sweet looking kitty. Find something he likes to snack on and put it in sight while you comb him every now and then. That way you don&#039;t have to pay a vet to do it!<br /><br />Buddy, you could always adopt a very young, declawedâ€”I totally disapprove of declawing a cat, but if you find one that already has to live with this conditionâ€”then you can give it a good home, and teach it to like being bathed and get it shaved periodically!<br /><br />(http://grottoazzurro.typepad.com/the_blue_grotto/images/shaved_cat.jpg)

				Yikes, I think that&#039;s the dreaded &quot;lion cut&quot;!&nbsp; Now you have excellent visuals as to why I was trying to find a special groomer.&nbsp; My &quot;prince&quot; looks pissed-off too, but I think it&#039;s really more of a general disdain for life among commoners.

				no that&#039;s him, the infamous Persian.&nbsp; I would give him a horrendous looking haircut myself before I would have him shaved.&nbsp; It might be hard to see because he&#039;s dark and the photo is small but his fur is intact.&nbsp; Although my dentist has a long haired cat and he shaves it, and insists the cat likes it.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t think he shave him to his skin though)

				Cats don&#039;t mind being shaved as long as you start doing it while they are young. It&#039;s just like a dog. Try to get a dog to like being groomed if they haven&#039;t heard the sound of the shaver until they are 6â€“9 months old. When I get a puppy, I take them to the groomer&#039;s place every month until they turn around 5 months old. They don&#039;t actually get groomed, though. They sit on the table, get fed yummy treats, listen to the clippers, watch the scissors near their face, get hugs and praise and then come back home. If you do the same thing with a cat, they not only will get used to it, they will start to enjoy the field trip. I used to take my children to the dentist every six months starting at age 2. They would sit in the dentist&#039;s chair, get a dentist&#039;s bib put on their neck and get their teeth counted while looking in the mirror. By the time they really needed to be seen by a dentist, they had no problems going. I remember sitting in the pediatric dentist&#039;s office and listening to a five year old screaming as though they were killing him! They were starting too late to have his teeth counted in this sterile and very strange environment. It can be a frightening experience for both children and pets, that&#039;s why it needs to be started when they still think of it as a fun thing to do.

I ONLY wish that were true! Many children are left abandoned in the street, police stations, hospitals. Just do a Google search for abandoned children; it&#039;s not completely unheard of and, in fact, is a growing problem. A lot of abandoned children (specifically babies) are left in garbage dumpsters and, if they survive, get put into child care services.

I don&#039;t see how there is any level of planning, caring, responsibility or openness in abandoning ones kids with only the chance to be cared for by strangers and and a pound for dogs? How is there any difference? The ONLY difference I can see is we don&#039;t put kids to death, at least not physically.

				Yes - you are.&nbsp; What I said was that turning ones child over to foster care or for adoption are the efforts that require some planning, care, etc. - not abandonment.&nbsp; We have gotten pretty far off the original subject of pets.

				Herbie was born to a feral momma cat. &nbsp;<br /><br />They have lots of problems with stray cats breeding at Javits. &nbsp;The woman who was fostering Herbie told me there&#039;s a Teamster that catches the kittens and adults whenever he can so they can either be A) adopted out or B) TNR. &nbsp;It&#039;s really sad. &nbsp;(Sad that there are so many cats in that dangerous area - happy that a Teamster is helping - just to clarify!)

				(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v424/bassbird/bestcatintheworld.jpg)<br /><br />Yeah, he&#039;s got us pretty well trained. I&#039;ll have to drag up a couple of the outdoor pics, he &quot;walks&quot; on a leash out in our building&#039;s garden. I say walk, it&#039;s mostly sleeping in the sun, then sleeping in the shade, then sleeping in the sun some more.<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of hard to see, but he does have a spot at the end of his tail. Apparently (I did some research) he&#039;s not <strong><em>really</em></strong> a white cat, he&#039;s spotted. It just happens to be a really big white spot...

				Back when we lived in Brooklyn, our landord (who had a business on the first floor of the building we were in) was kind of the neighborhood &quot;crazy cat lady&quot;, somebody left him on her front stoop in a box. We fostered him, but he totally won us over. :angel:
