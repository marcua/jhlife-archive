				I, too, would be interested in hearing everyone&#039;s suggestions, given that many buildings are facing the same challenges (specifically fairly small budgets).

				I sit on my co-op&#039;s board for a landmark status building.<br /><br />Two quick points:<br /><br />1) We switched managment companies as well recently.&nbsp; We moved from a big Manhattan company to a smaller Queens based agent.&nbsp; Every transition has its pains, but we have generally been happy with the move.&nbsp; Make sure to do your due dilligence and find a company (and property manager) that fit the needs of your building.<br /><br />2) As a board member, I&#039;d be very interested in having coffee with board members from different buildings.&nbsp; I think it would be great to compare notes and learn from each other&#039;s struggles and successes.&nbsp; Does such a group exist already?<br /><br />-Mr. Lee<br /><br />&nbsp;

				My building is looking to switch our management company.&nbsp; Would really love to hear suggestions from others in the neighborhood as to who to use and also who to steer clear of.&nbsp; We have All Area currently and are very unhappy, we&#039;ve switched through several managers with them already and they are not proactive and at times basically negligent. <br /><br />I understand through the grapevine that the Monroe recently dumped All Area as well, would be interested in learning more about that and who they went with instead if anyone here knows enough to share.

				What about self-managed?<br />My building (210 units) in Woodside (Berkeley Towers) has been self-managed and we have done amazingly well over the years, saving what I am sure is a very significant sum, in doing this.<br /><br />Only two maintenance increases in the last <strong>eleven </strong>years.

				I hate Lovett as well. They are incredibly rude and difficult to pin down for an answer once they actually deign to answer your call. (They will NOT return your call.) They&#039;re also at the farthest point in Queens and unless you feel like spending a mint on a cab (or own a car), they&#039;re really inconvenient. I
