				no yelp review yet. I don&#039;t post there as much lately unless it&#039;s a very quick review or I get another fan (and then I do a big one.).<br /><br />but, it&#039;s a very nice shop. good amount of room. pizza was nice, good cheese, sauce slightly tangy, goes nicely into the very thin crust. flour dusted. I&#039;m tellin&#039; you, good pizza. I was in there just a couple hours into service and there were quite a few people coming in and out. The kid who runs it takes lots of pride in his craft. said inspectors were the reason they took so long to open. I&#039;d love to have a food group there someday. <br />finally some respectable pizza comes to JH. (too bad it&#039;s elmhurst, and elmhurst already has a few good ones)<br /><br />try it for yourself, I wonder if people agree.

				I went today and it may have been an off day.&nbsp; The pizza didn&#039;t seem much better than what&#039;s on 37th Ave and it was under cooked.&nbsp; Also, confusion at the counter - the young guy was working and the older one watching.&nbsp; It&#039;s not fair to judge by one visit so I plan on returning in a few days.&nbsp;

				Earlie, I walked by at Noon and they&#039;re serving pasta. &nbsp;The small slate board on the counter near the register had 4 pasta dishes plus a veal and chicken dish. &nbsp;Two of the pasta dishes were were on tables a gnocchi with pesto sauce and the other a whole wheat linguine with marinara sauce. &nbsp;I don&#039;t remember the other pasta dishes or how the veal and chicken dishes are prepared since the counter was busy. &nbsp;They really should place a sign in the window listing these specials where someone could take their time deciding before entering.&nbsp; The place was busy.&nbsp; I plan to return for one of the chicken or veal dishes but not before 2PM.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regular slice is still $1.50 which is what most customers were ordering. &nbsp;

				Ordered a pie last night and had it delivered - broccoli and pepperoni. It was, by far, the best pizza in the hood. The broccoli had been sauteed with garlic and olive oil, but still was firm. Sauce was just right. Crust had a good consistency. Relatively outstanding. Finally, some good pizza.

				I checked this place out last week.&nbsp; Got a margarita slice (w/ fresh mozz &amp; basil) and wasn&#039;t into it.&nbsp; The sauce lacked salt. Maybe the regular slice is better? I&#039;ll have to go back again.

				Thanks for the heads up, Mike.&nbsp; I was starting to think that my pizza radar is wayyyy off.&nbsp; It seems like all of the pizza places in JH that I loathe are loved by the masses.&nbsp; For instance Due Frattelli or whatever it&#039;s called on 76th and 37th is always bustling... but it is some of the most undercooked and flavorless pizza I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I probably won&#039;t bother going to Louie&#039;s since it&#039;s outta my way.&nbsp; But I do have to say that Pizza Sam on 89th and Northern (also outta my way) is pretty good...

				you should try it for yourself. I think it&#039;s the only pizza in the roosevelt area worthwhile. Due fratelli is barely good and the rest are pretty bad. Louies is better than all of those. but really, try it for yourself and develop your own opinion. <br /><br />and in elmhurst, Gino&#039;s and Johns on grand are great slices. Some of the best in Queens in my opinion. yep.

				We just had their fresh pasta delivered, and it was FANTASTIC. The pizza is good, especially if we are talking relatively, but the pasta knocked our socks off.<br /><br />We got a ravioli (it has another name, but basically is ravioli) that was stuffed with an asparagus/ricotta mix. It actually tasted amazing. Frozen raviolis never quite taste like their stuffings, but this was totally rich and fresh, with a strong, perfect asparagus taste. I ordered a vegetable fettucine, also homemade, with bolognese. Incredible, incredible, incredible. I had to call back and give props.&nbsp; Order their pasta!!! It was only $16 for both, too.

				Ok, I googled La Fusta which is supposed to be near Louie&#039;s, and I got a map. It looks like Baxter crosses Roosevelt @83rd, then you travel south on Baxter. Louie&#039;s should be around Judge, before Broadway. I never go around there.

				Jeff, thanks for the tip on Louie&#039;s!&nbsp; I was over in the area a bit earlier and stopped by for a bite to eat.&nbsp; I must have arrived too early though because there wasn&#039;t much selection in term of slices, so I ended up ordering a pasta dish.&nbsp; Hey, I was hungry, and this fit the bill!&nbsp; The guys behind the counter were very friendly and paid close attention to how I wanted my pasta prepared.&nbsp; It was delicious and loaded with nice crunchy broccoli (hate wilted broccoli), zucchini, carrots and mushrooms...all in a very light olive oil and garlic sauce.&nbsp; Not greasy at all!&nbsp; Definitely recommend!<br /><br />Guess what?&nbsp; When I was finished with my meal, lo and behold the counter was full of assorted freshly prepared pies that looked amazing!&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to try that spinach slice next time.&nbsp;

				Hi I went to Louie&#039;s Pizza today and i have to say its the BEST pizza in the area. I havent had a good old fashion slice thin and crunchy like i did today in about 15 years in NY and for $1.50 you can&#039;t get anything better. I also tried the homemade pasta and believe it or not its better then half the places on the Upper East side. Its so light and fresh. You guys gotta go try it it was awesome. Thanks for telling me about the place...

				Just to add my 2 cents: took the kids there tonight. Thanks to all for recommending! Pizza was delicious--my slice had an excellent crispy crust, sauce has a really tasty blend of herbs. My son had one of the thick square slices (sicilian?). The dough was light and fluffy, not heavy and sodden as those slices often can be. Garlic knots also were good. And the guys were very friendly and accommodating to my kids.

				Ordered from Louie&#039;s tonight after seeing the glowing reviews. &nbsp;Customer service was extremely friendly and accommodating. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I didn&#039;t have a menu when I called, but I wanted a pizza with fresh tomatoes and fresh chopped garlic. &nbsp;I got the impression on the phone that the garlic topping wasn&#039;t on the menu, but he was very nice and said &quot;I&#039;ll see what I can do for you.&quot; &nbsp;Low and behold, some beautiful fresh garlic topped my pizza when it arrived. &nbsp;I think the delivery driver was REALLY busy tonight (good for them!), so my pizza looked a tad jostled around (some of the cheese had slid off). &nbsp;Good pizza, though.&nbsp; I wish the crust were thinner, but the cheese tastes very fresh and I like the sauce. &nbsp;Also, the dressing on the house salad is delicious! &nbsp;Will definitely order from Louie&#039;s again.&nbsp;

				I had the margarita pizza yesterday and I must say that this is the best tasting local pizza.&nbsp; The pizza&#039;s sauce was wonderfully fresh, slightly chunky and tangy, the pie was topped with fresh mozzarella, garlic and basil leaves.&nbsp; Personally the crust needed to be either crispier or slightly thicker and with a slight chew whereas it was a bit tough, dry and only slightly crunchy at the base.&nbsp; I will definitely go back and try the regular pie @ $11.00.&nbsp; I also would like to note that the staff is very friendly which is a breath of fresh air these days.&nbsp; :)

				I finally ordered a cheese pizza from Louie&#039;s and I&#039;m so disappointed.&nbsp; The guy i called was very nice but it took a pretty long time for the pizza to come and when it did it was overcooked and totally not delicious.&nbsp; I was so excited for this place and I&#039;m not even tHAT picky about my pizza.&nbsp;

				Louie&#039;s is incredible! <br /><br />I&#039;ve been there a number of times and have been greatly impressed by the friendly service and the care that the staff has for their food...they are very gracious and appreciative of your business as well...very refreshing! <br /><br />At $1.50, the regular slice is a steal! Its rare to find a slice under $2.50, let alone one that is as delicious as what you can get here. <br /><br />The Margarita slice is nicely flavored with the right amount of garlic...the pizza has gotten even better with crunchier crust over the past few visits. Also high marks for the chicken &amp; tomato and grandma slices.<br /><br />The agnolotti with pesto sauce is very flavorful and surprisingly light...not to mention that the pasta is homemade. The salmon with basil and tomato is also very light and delicious, sauteed with just the right amount of oil. <br /><br />I look forward to continually supporting such a great establishment...Jackson Heights finally has great pizza!

The pizza is not the only thing that&#039;s wonderful at Louie&#039;s the homemade pasta is sublime the delicate agnolotti with creamy pesto sauce is not to be missed!&nbsp; Yeah Louie&#039;s :rockon:

				I, like so many others, really like pizza.&nbsp; But I have never been one to make too much of a fuss of where I get my pizza from (just as long as it isn&#039;t from one of those godawful chains).&nbsp; While pizza from all the local places varies a bit, to me they are all pretty much the same. As the saying goes, six of one or a half dozen of the other.&nbsp; So I tend to go to the place that is the most convenient for me.<br /><br />I have been reading about Louie&#039;s on this thread and this past weekend I decided to give his pizza a go.&nbsp; I thought the pizza was very nice.&nbsp; I think Louie&#039;s pizza was a step up from the other local places.&nbsp; They clearly enjoy what they do and take pride in their food.&nbsp; And there is an added bonus, the pizza is very reasonably priced.&nbsp; I paid $14 for a pizza with sausage.&nbsp; Where I usually go they charge $20 for the same thing.<br /><br />Nice job Louie&#039;s.&nbsp; You have got my business.

				Jeff, it looked very good.&nbsp; An even better one is the place on Broadway just before you reach Queens Blvd.&nbsp; I forgot the name of the place.&nbsp; Try the seafood dishes at Armondo&#039;s.&nbsp; I go almost every day for lunch.&nbsp; They have salmon, trout and fillet of sole.&nbsp; Just $14.00&nbsp; Manhattan&nbsp; it would be $50 for the same quality.&nbsp; Get a side of spinach.&nbsp; They have the best Screwdriver made with fresh juice for $4.00.&nbsp; Outrageous.&nbsp; Amost empty.&nbsp; Just 6 people.&nbsp; 5 Star Food, Service and Ambiance.&nbsp; They&#039;re on the same level at Uncle Peters on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; They have a $23.95 Sunset special which includes a glass of wine and dessert.&nbsp; They&#039;re always crowded but not at lunch.&nbsp; I go there for Dinner.&nbsp; This place is 6 Star.&nbsp; The number of great restaurants in JH&#039;s is awesome.&nbsp; I don&#039;t eat anywhere else but here.&nbsp; Not even Manhattan where I lived for many years.&nbsp; People here are much better.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Manhattan Buildings NO one speak to anyone.&nbsp; Jeff, I know you&#039;re a food Critic so I&#039;m passing on this information which you may have already knew about.&nbsp; Its good to share information.&nbsp; The absolute BEST is El Pollo Inka Peru on Northern Blvd.&nbsp; The food is beyond incredible.&nbsp; This restaurant is 10 Stars.&nbsp; When I came out here I put on massive weight.&nbsp; I had to diet or have a stroke or heart attack.&nbsp; In 16 months, I&#039;ve lost 110 pounds mostly by walking 10 to 12 miles each day but not one time.&nbsp; Each miles is 100 calories.&nbsp; I know have a BMI index below 25.&nbsp; It was almost 40.&nbsp; Be well.

				haha - wow!<br />That place is Gino&#039;s, I think you mean. ANYTHING they make in square slices is excellent. I haven&#039;t had the grandma from there though....<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had Armondo&#039;s. I don&#039;t really intend to go there right now. Not sure why, it just seems a bit unexciting to me. Maybe I&#039;m wrong. 14 might be a good deal, but it&#039;s too much for me to spend at lunch, and I rarely drink. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been excited about Argentinian corona ave lately. There is Gauchito, esquina criollo, and rio de la plata bakery. This stuff is really exciting to me. You gotta check out the bakery though, very pretty stuff. <br /><br />I def want to go to Inka Peru though. the old place was great as well. This peruvian influx is very cool.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not a food critic! I&#039;m an enthusiast! and I&#039;m hungry

				We discovered Louie&#039;s right when it opened a few years ago, been regulars ever since. The salmon is fantastic! I order spinach calzone pretty often, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s actually on the menu. I love the food! And the price makes me keep coming back. I&#039;ve never had a problem with delivery, and I always order delivery, never have actually eaten there. It&#039;s not usually super fast, but this isn&#039;t fast food, it&#039;s good food. One time the chef/owner actually delivered! I guess they were short-staffed that day. I&#039;m so happy they exist.

				I&#039;m sure there is a pizza topic somewhere in the past on this site - because I know I first heard about Louie&#039;s Pizzeria 81-34 Baxter Ave here, but I can&#039;t find the post.&nbsp; I finally made it to Louie&#039;s this weekend I feared that the best pizza in JH area would not make me happy, so I didn&#039;t hurry over there. Was I wrong! I went home and threw out all the rest of my pizza menus!<br />Not only does Louie&#039;s Pizzeria have the best pizza in the JH area - it is excellent pizza for any neighborhood.&nbsp; With the caveat that it is thin crispy crust pizza.&nbsp; Wonderful!&nbsp; The pasta looks impressive as well.<br />If you haven&#039;t been there, go!

				Pull at least one of those old menus out of the trash, Liz. My <em><strong>onl</strong></em>y criticism of Louie&#039;s is that they are closed on Sundays, which makes the best pizza pies in the neighborhood unavailable for delivery whenever I&#039;m having company over for Giants games. Total bummer!

				it&#039;s probably the simplest pie/slice you can get. square (a la sicilian) but with much thinner crust. a little cheese first, some sauce on top of that, a sprinkle or two of parmesean and, usually, some fresh basil.<br /><br />in my opinion, it&#039;s great at louie&#039;s ... and a good barometer of how good any pizza place is -- after all, if you pile on eight ingredients, you can hide meh crust or bad sauce.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8364.msg48591#msg48591">Quote from: Liz on May 21, 2013, 07:31:57 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I like the name - what&#039;s on a grandma pie?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just had Louie&#039;s the first time this evening.&nbsp; Grandma slice was excellent,&nbsp; white pizza absolutely fabulous.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t try their heros yet, but saw some others eating them and they looked enormous.
