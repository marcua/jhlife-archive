				If they are hiding their grades then they are lilely hiding a good deal more.<br />But I suppose that should be obvious. Are they required to put the grade in the window or some other prominent place when you first walk in? Honestly, I haven&#039;t noticed any grades anywhere be it good, bad or otherwise. Maybe I am just oblivious?

				they&#039;re required to post them in the window, and most have done so. carollo bakery has an &quot;A&quot; .....only about 15 percent of places have been inspected so far....i&#039;ve seen more in midtown than in JH so far.

				According to the DOH website: Taqueria Coatzingo, Chivito D&#039;Oro, Armando&#039;s and Natives have B&#039;s. Kebab King and Mark Twain Diner have C&#039;s. Starbucks has an A. Their website is kinda janky and you can&#039;t search by grades.

				What&#039;s gross is that it&#039;s not hard to earn an A. Under the new system, if you do not get an A on your first visit, the DOH comes back within two weeks to reinspect. All you have to do is fix your problems and keep it clean for two weeks.

				Seba Seba, which appears to b popular among the locals was given a C...a grade which is well hidden from view, but you cant hide from the DOH website...or the subsequent penalty they will get for doing just that!

				Was just looking at the DOH &#039;s rating for Tomo...55 points...with a pending grade...that means they can close you unless they correct the violations. Well I guess its back to Happy Kitchen ...even if i have to wait forever for my order.

				You can&#039;t judge by appearance. Some places look really nice like Seba Seba and then get a low rating. Others look skeptical like the Indian place on 74 Street at the foot of the 7&#039;s steps, and they got an A.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about behind the scene and not what is seen!

				Also keep in mind that it&#039;s not <span class="bbc_u">just</span> about cleanliness. Inspection grades are <span class="bbc_u">also</span> about safe food handling practices. Things like making sure perishables are stored at the proper temperatures; taking steps to ensure that there is no cross-contamination of utensils, food containers, preparation surfaces, etc. That being said, I also know it&#039;s really not <span class="bbc_u">that</span> hard to get an &quot;A&quot; or at least a &quot;B&quot;, so rest assured I will <span class="bbc_u">not</span> be eating at any establishment that could only manage a &quot;C&quot;!!!&nbsp; :P
