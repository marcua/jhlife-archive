					I had never seen the inside of the Blue Haven in the many times I walked past it on the way to my Boy Scout meetings in 1954. The smoked windows , the adults only atmosphere, the darkness made it something that you only peeked it to see but not for too long certainly not long enough to attract a bouncer&#039;s attention So it was an unexpected treat after all those long years to finally see what the place looked like and to even see some of the flyers for what must have been a great night out. I&#039;d love to see the films that were made of those cigar fumed nights.<br />Thee was another night club in those days on Northern Boulevard which wasn&#039;t really my territory (excepting those times that I went to the Boulevard Theater to see a movie) that I think was owned by Sam the Taylor whose sax was a familiar break in the old&nbsp; three minute Rock &#039;n&#039; Roll songs. Does anyone remember that place?&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I&#039;m not sure whether there is any energy in this issue given some of the replies. I suppose one can be excused&nbsp; a kind of fatalism about noise where it is just simply part of the urban life we lead and not subject to regulation. However there are those who study the issue, document its ill affects and propose implementable policies about diminishing noise in NYC<br /><br />Here is a link about some dedicated noise warriors-<br /><br /><a href="https://thecrimereport.org/2018/02/15/noise-and-crime-a-link-too-often-ignored/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://thecrimereport.org/2018/02/15/noise-and-crime-a-link-too-often-ignored/</a>

					Is there even a remote possibility that someone takes this problem seriously? Noise pollution is a scourge in urban life ; it degrades the environment, it makes people angry, it raises blood pressure, it creates the context for road rage and it is so unnecessary. Most of the time a jam is unavoidable and no one&#039;s fault. Sitting on the horn doesn&#039;t solve the problem of traffic.<br /><br />I hope the political class takes some notice of this blight. Perhaps signs with warnings and fines for offenders(with enforcement!)might make the worst polluters know there is penalty for this behavior.

					At about 7:20PM I went out and saw multiple ambulances perhaps six maybe more racing down 37th Avenue and seemingly making a turn towards Roosevelt at 76th St. although some were going down 37th beyond 76th. There were also two that went up 77th Street There was an ambulance parked in front of PS 69 but that is now gone. I also some police cars as well.I have no idea what they were responding to but with that number of ambulances all sirens blaring it was something they needed to get to quickly. <br /><br />Does anyone know what the emergency was?

					I don&#039;t buy very much at Lemon Tree although I&nbsp; frequently stop by for odds and ends. I agree that the new ownership seem not to be making much of an effort to engage with their customers. Certainly the young women who had been there a few weeks ago seemed much friendlier than the present group who seem to make very little effort to develop a positive presence. Given the competition in the neighborhood that attitude comes with a price.

					There was tape across the road on 76th Street so the road was blocked from GNC to the other side of the street .It looked like crime scene tape but as we were slowly driving by it is hard to say anything with certainty There seemed to be a small cluster of people(perhaps 25 or so)on the Foodtown side of the street looking on. Also from a car window we saw what appeared to be a sheet over something (or somebody) near GNC. Can&#039;t provide anything more but I hope it wasn&#039;t a serious crime incident.

					Two depressing additions to the list of small shops closing in JH. Ingrids Beauty Shop on 78th and 35th and the pizza store also on 35th between 77th and 78th. Both places had been there for some time -the pizza place had a changed ownership not too long ago. I suppose the worst outcome is that these two prime sites just get boarded up and left to rot like the store on 35th near 76th street which was supposed to be the site of a new restaurant but now just appears to be inactive. There seems so much potential in the neighborhood for new developments but we seem to only attract banks,drug stores or chain clothing outlets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Is there any indication that the political class in JH has any interest in this ?

					D. Keith Mano died recently. He was an author who I wasn&#039;t familiar with but the obituary piqued my interest so I read and recently completed one of his novels. The novel was called &quot;Topless&quot; and as in many of his novels it addresses Mano&#039;s rigorous Christianity but with a twist-the novel is about an Episcopal priest who inherits his brother&#039;s topless bar.&nbsp; <br />The point of all this is that it takes place in Jackson Heights. The bar in this novel is called The Car and is on Northern Boulevard in 60&#039;s . It sounds like it could have been Jaxs, the diner, in some previous life or maybe it was simply invented as some of the things in the novel seem to be such as The Jackson Heights Free Press newspaper. Mano was from Queens -grew up in Whitestone and seemed to know Jackson Heights fairly well. The police in this novel are accurately portrayed as coming from the 115th Precinct. Anyone else familiar with his books or&nbsp; perhaps even knew him?

					<br />Why does an important hub station like our own 74th Street seems to have no user group that regularly meets with the manager of the station or with the MTA. Certainly one basic issue might be the level of cleanliness on the subway tracks,platforms,tile walls, and the terminal itself. When you look down from the elevator on the Flushing side you see layers of filth encrusted on the lights. The elevator itself usually reeks of urine. This lack of care becomes self perpetuating as many users come to expect that this is just the way it is.<br />But beyond that base line issue are other things less critical but still an element in creating a positive quality of life for commuters. That might include more interesting wall displays for example.In the London Network there is video based advertising that offsets the cost of maintaining the system. Why are we stuck with billboards that reflects a hundred year old form and in any event just become the target for graffiti? Why is there no trafficator that shows all the bus lines and their arrival and departure times?<br /><br />Whether or not any of these things are implementable is less of a question then why we don&#039;t have the possibility of meeting with the administrators and managers of a service we use and pay for.<br />

					I had the same phone call from this company which on a reverse phone lookup is in Massachusetts and is shown as a scam site. I called Time Warner as well and they denied knowing anything about this supposed upgrade. I would be very careful about revealing anything about yourself to them without a confirming letter from Time Warner. BTW T/W has been bought out by a new company called Spectrum . I received a letter from Spectrum in the last few days and they promise improved service in the next few months.<br /><br />Given Time Warner&#039;s outages recently I hope this promise of improvement holds up.

					<br />One mystery solved-and many thanks for that. Would it be fair to ask if he lived in a house or an apartment? I wonder if the current residents know that Kuhn lived there? Apparently even after his citizenship was revoked,served time in jail, and deported back to Germany he still wanted to come back-such is the magnetic pull of Jackson Heights. Perhaps his shade in full brown shirt uniform&nbsp; walks in the still of the night up and down 73rd street(note to all-this is not an encouragement to revive Fritz Kuhn in the annual JH Halloween parade)<br /><br />And now on to the great and maybe the greatest former resident of Jackson Heights-Orson Welles. Could it be that Welles and Kuhn had breakfast at Jahns at the same time. Or eyed each other from a safe distance on the platform waiting for the F train? Who knows or as Welles might have said when he was playing The Shadow on the radio- &quot;the Shadow knows&quot;

					Jackson Heights has had a number of residents whose celebrity we can all take pride in even if their time in our community was fleeting. The first is Orson Welles who in his early years in New York was involved in theatre both as a director and performer. In the book Young Orson by Patrick McGilligan there is a brief mention of him living in Jackson Heights. The book doesn&#039;t say where and if there are any known details it would be very useful to add that to the historical record of previous JH residents.<br /><br />The other is the infamous Fritz Kuhn who was the head of the German-American Bund, a Nazi front organization that was once strong enough to hold a rally in Madison Square Garden where some twenty thousand brown shirted followers attended. Kuhn was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement(he was a crook as well as being a fascist) and then deported to Germany where he died unmourned and unknown. He lived in Jackson Heights where his residence had a police guard.The newspaper archives always described him as living in Jackson Heights so he wasn&#039;t just a visitor in the community. Does anyone know where this infamous artifact of the 30&#039;s lived?<br />

					I guess there is probably an empathy gene missing in my baseball DNA but this Yankee fan cannot muster any hometown loyalty for the Mets. My baseball hometown is The Bronx and anything that extends beyond River Avenue is enemy territory as far as I&#039;m concerned.For a Yankee fan to support a team with pretensions to being the&quot; real New York team&quot; seems incomprehensible and generous to a fault.Baseball is a Darwinian struggle for supremacy and dominance. I expect as much from Mets fans regarding the Yanks and that is usually what I get (try listening to WFAN during the season for confirmation).&nbsp; <br /><br />Admittedly there is a thorny ethical dilemma of what to do when the RedSox play the Mets, a question I have not as yet resolved. The nearest I come to being a &quot;hometown fan &quot; is when it comes to the the Giants and Jets who I can support with equal if perhaps tepid interest. <br /><br />So roll on World Series and lets get to Spring training 2016 when the next season begins and my baseball interest returns
