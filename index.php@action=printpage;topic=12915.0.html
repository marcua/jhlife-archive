				Hello,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just wanted to get the opinion of somebody who is either in construction or just has a decent understanding of building structure. <br />I&#039;m on the top floor (6) apartment. I have this little out of the way changing room to one end of the apartment; it&#039;s quite spacious. I wanted to hang a punching bag there, but not be a nuisance to my downstairs neighbor.<br />1. Would the punching bag hold?<br />2. does being on the top floor minimize the vibrations that my downstairs neighbors would feel?

				Not to be flippant, but if you have to ask that question in this forum, then you do not have the technical skills to hang a bag.&nbsp; And even if you did, there would be no way that the building would allow it and there would be no way that your downstairs neighbors would not force you to immediately put your boxing skills to use.<br /><br />That said, I completely get the urge to do it.&nbsp; Back when I lived in Astoria, I used to be a part of Club Fitness and they had a bag which I loved.&nbsp; Life Health &amp; Fitness had one too.&nbsp; Nothing like 10 minutes on the bag after a good workout.&nbsp; I doubt that Blink would have a bag and I am not sure if any other gym around here has one.&nbsp; Would love to know though. <br />

				@mkn: the integrity of the building will be unlikely to be affected, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re asking in your first question. To hold, it will have to be installed properly and solidly; the factors to consider are the weight of the bag, your ceiling, the integrity of the beams or whatever you have, etc. It might be better to get someone to install it for you. <br /><br />Let&#039;s keep in mind that the idea of this forum is to profit from the collective knowledge, and be helpful or quiet.

First question is that it needs to hang in a way that it won&#039;t fall or destroy your ceiling, so I am guessing it would require someone to identify a joist or a beam that you can hang from and the joist or a beam would have to be strong enough to support the weight of the bag. <br /><br />Second question has to do with sound and vibration transfer. This will likely require an acoustics and soundproofing expert- 1. they will need to figure out a way to decouple the connection point to the joist/beam tat the bag hangs from, because if not property decoupled, you will be sending vibration to the entire upper floor before it transfers itself to the lower floors. 2.- is the actual sound transfer. When you hit a bag, it usually produces a sound loaded with low end frequencies below 60hz. Much like a bass drum on a drum kit. That is the lowest and longest sound wave which is very difficult to stop from traveling through walls. And given that you will likely be doing some foot work, the floor below you will also take a beating. <br /><br /><br />

				this sounds like a very bad idea. Walking across the floor without carpets and pads can be enormously annoying in a prewar building and you would like to pound repeatedly on a bag over someone&#039;s apartment?<br />

				If a co-op, Do you think your board would approve this kind of structural alteration? What would happen if they inspected and found out you&#039;d made this kind of alteration without permission? What are the fines detailed in the house rules?

				<br />The question wasn&#039;t DO I HAVE THE KNOW HOW to put up the bag. If i did would I really need the advice of anybody on here?<br /><br />Also i tried to emphasize that the area to be used is an out of the way changing room. If you live in the historic/landmark district then you know what these are; they are not above the living-room or bedroom or kitchen. It just so happens that my &quot;changing room&quot; is extra spacious, for a changing room. <br /><br />Plus the area&#039;s floor is tiled. It already serves as my workout room as well as my guitar (with amplifier) room, which is why I didn&#039;t ask if it would make too much noise. <br /><br />I literally meant/mean vibration...as in shaking the walls of my downstairs neighbors.<br />And, please, leave the cute comments for your facebook status updates. <br />

				This is a message board. No one has violated the rules of politeness in their responses. Some of us are just glad we don&#039;t live underneath someone who has a workout room, a guitar with amplifier and potentially a punching bag. Perhaps there is no issue, and you should go ahead and speak to your property manger and/or a structural engineer.

Should I be quiet because I shared the collective truth that being a downstairs neighbor can be difficult at best when your upstairs neighbor decides to do things that are perhaps not appropriate for apartment living? Look if you have the blessing of your property manager, the building board and your downstairs/sideways neighbors, god bless you. But actually the purpose of a message baord is to share thoughts, within the parameters of politenesss. You cannot pick and choose member&#039;s responses, just because they disagree with you. You can pay people to agree with you, but not on this board.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>edited by mod to separate quote from new post</em></span>

				Actually I am now doubly glad to not have someone like you as a neighbor, since you&#039;ve just proven yourself to be rude and selfish. I voiced an opinion which is reasonable, but you&#039;ve resorted to insults, as would a bully.
