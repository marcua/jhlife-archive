				it was never on 37th [at least not as i can recall, going back at least 18 years]. the much MUCH smaller location was on 74th, almost to 37th, in a tiny sliver of a place. it may be where al naimat is now, but that seems a lot bigger than the original jackson diner. within a door or two of that, though. i loved that location, but there was another place on the block -- in one of the current jewelry stores -- that blew it away. a south indian place called udupi palace that had such incredibly clean spice flavors in its dosas and utthapam. <br /><br />and now i am getting hungry :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=3765.msg24477.html#msg24477">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on December 04, 2009, 07:35:18 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It was on 37th before, where did it used to be??? what is there now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I think it may have moved more than once.&nbsp; My first-ever visit to Jackson Heights was circa 1990, and when a friend who grew up nearby took me to the Jackson Diner.&nbsp; I remember it being on the second floor of a building on 74th Street... perhaps near Al-Naimat, or perhaps not quite so far up the block. It was a genuine dive.&nbsp; I remember the restaurant as being hot and even steamy because it had an open kitchen.&nbsp; It had plastic checkered tablecloths and other diner-like touches, but served miraculously delicious and spicy Indian food.&nbsp; I think the contrast between the excellent food and dive-y atmosphere of the place is what led to its citywide fame around that time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Little did I know at the time that this would be my future neighborhood.&nbsp; And little did I know at the time that another friend who was along for the meal would become my future wife!

				Wow Todd!&nbsp; I never knew that Jackson Diner had yet a third location in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I had only been to the location described above by dssjh and myself.&nbsp; The atmosphere you describe is quite similar to the place I remember though.

				Well, my memory is certainly fallible, so I may be confused on a detail or two. &nbsp;My wife says she also remembers eating upstairs, but thinks the kitchen may have been on the ground floor. &nbsp;So maybe this is the same place you&#039;re remembering.<br /><br />This article (http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/arts/india-casts-its-subtle-spell-on-queens.html) places the Jackson Diner at 37-03 74th Street (the current location of Al-Naimat) in 1994. &nbsp;And other references I&#039;ve found online show the restaurant being located there as early as 1990.

				If you look closely at the restaurant near the pizza place on the corner of 74th, you will notice that the building that now has the South Asian sweets restaurant looks like a diner car. That&#039;s why it was first called Jackson Diner.<br /><br />Why not just ask the owner? He is very approachable.

				I also remember it being next to pizza boy on 74th street, I went when it really was an American diner with a few Indian dishes. There was a German waitress who corrected my pronunciation of &quot;chole puri&quot;. You could get a tuna salad sandwich or chicken tikka. :smiley6600: As far as I can remember it was never upstairs and I was going as far back as 1988. BTW, I&#039;m a she!

				Jackson Diner was indeed next to Pizza boy, it moved to where it is now which used to be Lamston&#039;s (otherwise known as the 5 and 10). I doubt it had a 3rd location, but is it possible that it was confined to the upstairs section while they re-fitted Lamstons to become the new and improved diner?

				Delhi Palace has a 2nd floor. Perhaps we&#039;re confusing the two places...<br />I ate upstairs once a year or two ago when they were packed on the weekend during brunch.

				Per a 1993 NY Times article one of the old addresses was 37-03 74th Street.&nbsp; There are several articles that mention the Jackson Diner.&nbsp; Maybe you can glean some information from them.&nbsp; Good luck.

				It&#039;s called Jackson Diner because, as Ernie says, it was once, more or less, a &quot;traditional&quot; American diner.&nbsp; My recollection is that it was always right next to Pizza Boy and that it did not have a second floor.

				The original Jackson Dinner was a small silver bullet dinner - free standing - on 74th street next to Pizza Boy. The building was built around it. It was the basic dinner - burgers, eggs, sandwiches, etc. <br /><br />Then it converted to the Indian style food. Finally, as it&#039;s following became larger and the space opened up, it moved to the middle of the block where it is now.

				Does anyone else find the decor of Jackson Diner (new) reminiscent of being inside of the whale in Pinocchio?<br /><br />Just a random thought. Maybe belongs in Random.

				Not only is the Jackson House a diner, and the Jackson Diner a restuarant that moved about, but as recent as the mid 1980s there was still a private house ON 74th Street between Pizza Boy and the stores further down the block.&nbsp; Maybe even two houses, but I recall at least one because we shoveled their snow when my teen shoveling crew ran about on blizzards.<br /><br />So the Jackson Diner was near a house, or came just after one, where the Jackson House has been a diner.&nbsp; Got it?&nbsp; :)

				Semi-related by a tangent ... Arunee Thai was once the local of a Indian restaurant in the &#039;70s, before the big 74th Street collection of resturants appeared.<br /><br />
