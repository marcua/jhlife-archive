				What is spaming the board.&nbsp; I am posting in 2 different ways.&nbsp; Should I post 1 listing for each and every item I have for sale?&nbsp; That would make it about 20 listings.&nbsp; Please let me know, this is the first time I am doing this and I do not want to be in trouble.&nbsp; I am just looking for the best way to advertise all the stuff I have to sell from my Aunt&#039;s apt.

				Not to sound mean but you will never sell at those high prices for used almost 50yr old items. Anyone can go to macys or LL bean and buy a new sweater for less&nbsp; than that. If you want to donate try habitat for humanity on northern blvd in woodside. They will come and pick up your stuff.

				If you can go to LL Bean or Macy&#039;s and buy a high end quality Sweater for $25 then go ahead.&nbsp; Buy the way, the furniture can be up to 50 years old, some of us call that almost an antique and is highly valued.&nbsp; These items do not coming from a dime store.
