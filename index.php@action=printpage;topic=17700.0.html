				I have to say that Crowley did a great job answering questions at the event yesterday. There was a fairly good size crowd. He was pretty straight up and spoke about some of the larger implications of the free wheeling gun laws in America like what happens when we allow the police to obtain military vehicles and how that can lead to people feeling like they need an arsenal in their homes. Additionally, he accepted blame that Democrats did not act to re implement an assault weapons ban when they were in the majority of both chambers in 2008. He seems pretty sympathetic to the issue. There was a guy there that seemed kinda agitated and seemed like he came to rock the boat. He was huffing and puffing a lot. <br /><br />Side note: Peralta showed up about half way through. He was calling out &quot;Congressman&quot; like an overly eager child in a classroom. He spoke about a plan to implement school lock downs and smoke bombs or signals. Not sure...<br />Thankfully a woman called him out and said she was highly concerned about the effect that has on learning and a child&#039;s &quot;psyche&quot;.<br />He later posted his photo with Crowley to his twitter page saying &quot;Participating&quot; in a town hall with Congressman Crowley. Perhaps attempting to imply he was co-hosting. That guy has no shame....

				I can’t recall one positive thing that Crowley has done to improve the neighborhood. He was on Fox News and seems more interested in going against Pelosi for speaker. Can’t imagine that he would win. He seems unprepared when he speaks compared to other members of congress. He also seems more interested in Trump bashing which does little for our community.

				Of course he is. Crowley made him by choosing him. You wonder what percentage of Crowley’s district of Queens and Bronx is made up of illegal residents. I think it is at least 15%. Should he consider their opinions when he votes on legislation that affects everyone in his district? Should he hire a illegal to operate as an outreach for illegals.

				This is the old fear tactic of claiming the GOP is taking away your Medicare and social security. Actually Social Security benefits will rise by about $50 a month for the first time in years.

				Hesitate to jump into this thread, but wanted to point out that Crowley has a primary challenger, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:<br /><br />https://ocasio2018.com/<br /><br />I&#039;m undecided, but Crowley has been in the House for a number of terms now and doesn&#039;t really have a long list of accomplishments. Leaning towards a fresh face, especially one that will work against Trump&#039;s agenda

The deal is if they returned to the fold, the state party would not support challengers. I&#039;m not super clear on the details but I believe as the chair of the Queens Democratic party that means he&#039;s not going to be supporting any of Peralta&#039;s challengers. Don&#039;t know that that translates in to an endorsement for Peralta though.

				The IDC were an invention of Cuomo. My guess would be that Crowley was not into it. Especially considering his own political ambitions. Perhaps thats likely why he was there for the &quot;end&quot;. When Peralta raised his hand to speak at the town hall. Crowley was looking at his watch and asking about time. Hard to think of a worse signal than that... But, who knows.<br /><br />Can&#039;t really think of why not to support him other than that it&#039;s a little weird for one guy to pursue so much power. He&#039;s the head of the Queens Democratic party and the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. He does a great job of showing up in the district but, what if he suddenly went the way of a lot of these guys that wanted to strip away health care without even explaining it to anyone. Then, hid the rest of the year. He would be so hard to remove.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked into Ocasio-Cortez. She seems ok. She&#039;s done good things but, is really young and her back story is that she went to the DAPL protests and OUR REVOLUTION asked her to run. Her main criticism is that Crowley doesn&#039;t live here. But, nothing about his voting record. For me that&#039;s not a good enough reason.<br /><br />

				Crowley&#039;s official/legal residence is still the home he owns on 65th street. i have seen him on 61st and on lower Roosevelt from time to time, so i know he spends SOME time there. i don&#039;t have a clue how much, but he&#039;s not a total absentee.

				I think it&#039;s pretty well established that MOCs spend less time than we&#039;d all like actually on the Hill actually legislating. But if you actually look at the calendar of days in session, it&#039;s pretty absurd to suggest in the first quarter of this year, our MOC could have been in Woodside really at all save for a day trip or and overnight. And, when you add fundraising, meetings off the Hill, constituent services, etc. I think the criticism is just strange.&nbsp; Especially strange was the criticism someone leveled on the board about his kids attending school in Virginia. Yeah, no kidding they live where they can actually spend time with their father. (How old are his kids, BTW?)<br /><br />https://www.congress.gov/days-in-session (https://www.congress.gov/days-in-session)<br />https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250 (https://www.thoughtco.com/average-number-of-legislative-days-3368250)<br /><br />^I see in the neighborhood a fair amount when congress isn&#039;t in session (like this month). Which if you think about it makes perfect sense since he has offices on 37th Ave. and a campaign office here. I imagine he spends some time in the Bronx as well since he has an office there as well.

				Because you are only supposed to refer to Illegal aliens as undocumented unlawfully present individuals even though the immigration laws&nbsp; calls them illegal aliens. Our congressional representatives are actually advocating amnesty toward all illegals.

My understanding is that it seems like the person in question&#039;s very existence is being called in to question, and it certainly gets problematic when you&#039;re talking about kids.

				districts in other states (or upstate, even) cross county lines all the time, sometimes going through four, five, six counties. using a river as an arbitrary dividing line is kind of silly. they don&#039;t do it in the dozens of areas bisected by the mississippi, the missouri or other large rivers, nor do they do it upstate for the Hudson, or for mountain ranges/outcroppings in states with a lot of those.

The number of representatives per state is determined by the U.S. Census every 10 years, and redistricting happens when representatives to a state are added or taken away. Per the 2010 Census, each district is supposed to have approximately 711,000 residents. So, you can see from those two criteria how the Bronx can&#039;t be it&#039;s own separate district, and how complicated it can get when drawing the congressional districts if they are all supposed to have approximately the same number of residents.<br /><br />Outside of redistricting related to the Census, the only other example I am familiar with is the redistricting that has taken place in Pennsylvania. In that instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of those who sued on the grounds that the state congressional map violated the Pennsylvania constitution by discriminating against Democrats. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court redrew the Pennsylvania Congressional map. The only involvement of the federal courts there was to say they aren&#039;t getting involved. If there are actual instances of federal courts redrawing state congressional maps, I&#039;m unaware of that.<br />http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/state/pennsylvania-gerrymandering-case-congressional-redistricting-map-coverage-guide-20180308.html (http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/state/pennsylvania-gerrymandering-case-congressional-redistricting-map-coverage-guide-20180308.html)<br />http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/03/pennsylvania_elbows_to_center.html (http://www.pennlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/03/pennsylvania_elbows_to_center.html)<br /><br /><br />

				I watched it. <br /><br />It was so short I felt like it wasn&#039;t much of a debate. Ocasio was prepared (which I expected). But, also more polished than expected. Which was cool. Crowley definitely winged it. He&#039;s on TV often and this didn&#039;t seem like his greatest appearance. They each lied about something. Crowley about board approval for the Target condos, Ocasio for her response on a Reddit thread where she said she does not believe in federal laws the for guns.

For me that was disappointing because she tried to make a fool of him and say he trolls reddit but, it came right from an ask me anything session she participated in. <br /><br />The response online was overwhelmingly boosting her but, very oddly from people outside the district and even the state!

Weird....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I checked the AMA - here&#039;s the link:<br />https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/6ftvhu/hey_reddit_i_am_alexandria_ocasiocortez_us/dikxy1u/<br /><br />The impression that Joe Crowley tried to pass off (to me at least) was that she&#039;s against gun reform on the national level. But her exact words from the AMA are &quot;I happen to support NYC&#039;s more strict take on gun control. But I also believe that there needs to be flexibility on the national level&quot;.<br /><br />Flexibility =/= &quot;I don&#039;t believe in federal gun laws&quot; in my eyes. It reads more like &quot;there should be more gun laws, and they&#039;ll probably be different in different states. Because it&#039;s a Democracy&quot;.<br /><br />Re: Twitter -- that&#039;s not surprising. She&#039;s had a ton of media attention in the last couple of weeks, mainly becuase she&#039;s very intelligent, grew up in the district, has liberal cred (protested at Standing Rock), and is unapolegitcally progressive + going up against one of the most powerful politicians in New York. She&#039;s the kind of Democrat that a lot of people want to see more of.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how I felt: I through Crowley did better in the debate itself, but nothing about his performance motivates me to get up &amp; vote for him - he&#039;s still a &#039;par-the-course&#039; candidate &amp; my feelings aren&#039;t particularly strong for him, nor did he give me a reason apart from &quot;Donald Trump is bad&quot; and &quot;Democrats are good&quot;. His performance doesn&#039;t motivate me towards action on election day. Crowley really should be winning this given that he&#039;s been here for 20 years...but I&#039;ve honestly never really knew much about him until this race, which says a lot considering the amount of news I read.<br /><br />Alexandria was energetic, **really** knows the issues, spoke to my pains &amp; made the choice very clear. She gave one answer that I didn&#039;t like: the &#039;unity&#039; answer. Alexandria&#039;s is fiercly against a lot of what Crowley has benefitted from (massive donations, a lot from the same folks that donate to Trump), but people will be reminded of the &quot;Bernie or Bust&quot; stuff, which pissed off a lot of Democrats in 2016. That&#039;ll almost certainly turn off some Democrats; whomever thought of that question is a mad genius. <br /><br />But, she&#039;s very clearly an organizing force, and she reflects my feelings towards politics on the local &amp; national levels -- nothing&#039;s getting better. Crowley has accumulated all this power locally (head of the Queens Democratic Caucus, makes &amp; breaks candidacies) but the achievements he tauts are on the national level (voted for ObamaCare, voted for Dodd Frank, etc). He&#039;s had 20 years to make more of a direct impact in the community, and yet before this election I&#039;ve never heard of him.

				I agree with a lot of what you&#039;re saying about Crowley. He&#039;s accumulated a lot of power and doesn&#039;t have much to show for it. Queens may have diversity among their candidates but, the sound &quot;meh&quot; rings in my head when I think of them. For me it&#039;s a question of what good is trying to gather more influence when you don&#039;t really have a vision or even a few bills that you&#039;ve written over that lengthy period of time. It&#039;s like just for the sake of it?<br /><br />There is definitely a &quot;Bernie or bust&quot; thing brewing here. She has been HEAVILY promoted by all the media sources loved by the further left activist types. It&#039;s helped her stay competitive (which is great for democracy). However, that&#039;s an issue because they don&#039;t live in Dist-14. It&#039;s a campaign that has largely targeted younger people (who don&#039;t always vote) and ignored older residents (who are active and regular voters). The older folks are VERY loyal to Crowley. It&#039;s easy to see all her supporters crying foul if it doesn&#039;t pan out. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to seem rude but, if you don&#039;t know much about Crowley you just haven&#039;t been paying attention. That guy shows up everywhere around here. He holds town halls not just in JH but, East Elmhurst and Corona. If he&#039;s not doing that he is on TV fairly regularly too. <br /><br />To me, that comment (not knowing him) speaks to the problem we face. Mass disengagement. Lefty hero Noam Chomsky himself said that the left &quot;collapsed&quot; during the Obama years. If you don&#039;t know who your reps are then that&#039;s cause you are not interested. Reading the news is just a form of entertainment at it&#039;s core. <br /><br />Ocasio&#039;s campaign is somewhat of a reflection of that. I&#039;m not sure SHE new much about Crowley before this. In my experience, activist culture has a problem with leadership because everything must be decentralized and wholly democratic. Imagine if there were individuals that actually ran after Occupy with the support and organization that they had. Politicians would die for that. This is exactly what happened to the student movement during Vietnam, they got bored and went to sleep ushering in the Reagan era. The Hamster wheel is coming around again....

I made the mistake of exaggerating my last sentence - I&#039;ve seen him on Sunday television &amp; have sent his office a significant amount of correspondence about one issue or another for the last couple of years. I&#039;m aware of him as our congressperson, and certainliy aware of his standing in local &amp; national politics, but I haven&#039;t seen the benefits to our district as a result.<br /><br />On activist culture&#039;s disdain for leadership &amp; &quot;Bernie or Bust&quot; -- it would seem that both of those ideas are idametrically opposed from one another, right? You can&#039;t be disdainful for leadership, while simultaneously putting all of your eggs in the basket of a single person. Occupy certainly was distrustful of leadership, but this new blend of liberal activism (Parkland Kids, Black Lives Matter, Bernie people) don&#039;t seem to have that problem.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. Crowley isn&#039;t some great evil, but as you said, he&#039;s accumulated a lot of power &amp; doesn&#039;t have much to show for it. It&#039;s been 20 years, and Crowley has had a long career. Whomever wins I&#039;ll no doubt vote for the Democrat, but having a driven, intelligent, unapolegically progressive &amp; energized person to represent &amp; fight for our incredibly unique district in Ocasio-Cortez is something I really look forward to.

That said, this is also a Democracy, and I am representative of the people&#039;s wishes, not the other way around - and so my endorsement will reflect the will of the people whom have lifted me to this point.&quot;<br /><br />IMO, in this day and age, what this country needs on both sides, is the political courage to stand not just with your tribe, but for what&#039;s right. Republicans in Congress have chosen to enable Trump again &amp; again because he&#039;s got the R next to our name. We ask them to stand up to him, stand for the values our country has stood for, but what good is that request if we can&#039;t do the same? <br /><br />Speaking of endorsements -- MoveOn just endorsed her.

				Crowley&#039;s campaign office is on 80th and Northern. <br />One of the major tiff&#039;s i have is his support for less than par candidates in local races. His campaign office hosted a kick off for Espinal for Assembly. What&#039;s asinine is that the location is not in the Assembly district. Why would he agree to support her other than political kickback. She was Moya&#039;s phone answerer... now no one answers the phone at Moya&#039;s office...which incidentally is not in HIS district either. Locally, Joe Crowley is the leader of the sloppy rewards party. Though he might speak boldly and with a Queens Values sensibility in DC, he&#039;s missed the boat on the home front. There are many in Queens Dem&#039;s party who deserve backing and a shot at an elected office they would like to serve. Sadly, under his careful coiffing, they miss out. Lately, it&#039;s felt to me as dire as the expression &quot;One of those people might have cured cancer&quot; there are many good people who do tons of civic duty in the community- but they are rarely empowered. As the leader of the party- he should have done more. Now that party is losing New Visions Democratic Club. Who can speak to that?

				In order to be a member group, I believe you have to have a District leader elected to the club= that&#039;s done by a petitioning process similar to what other elected&#039; are doing. The District Leader of New Visions was Councilmember Dromm. However, conflicts arose regarding the petitions- as the page would have Peralta, Espinal and the District Leader slot on the same form, which was troublesome. So, he chose not to...electively losing the seat and voting power for the club. Clubs assign poll workers and vote on judgeships and other positions, so as I understand it, New Visions won&#039;t have that now. I&#039;m awestruck that this hasn&#039;t been bigger news, but it&#039;s politics and so much is done in closed door negotiations that change on a daily basis.

				I am not nor have I ever been a supporter or voter of Crowley. This is because of two simple words: Iraq Resolution. The minority of Democratic congresspeople who voted Yea on this (82 vs. 126 Nay) should have been tarred, feathered, and removed from decision-making power a very long time ago. This consequences of this vote resonate around the world to this day. And reasonable people can argue that we would not be living in the land of Cult 45 were it not for that stupid invasion.

				I don&#039;t know what people are expecting one Member of Congress to &quot;deliver&quot; locally. He was and is on the right side of the most important issues.&nbsp; At the debate, he pointed out that he actively resisted Obama&#039;s immigrant detention policies that, for awhile, were odious to the progressive left (and to me!). He said he favored single payer health insurance and elsewhere has supported Medicare for All. Yes, he gets funded by corporations and banks, but he pushed hard for Dodd-Frank. This is a national emergency. He might be the next Speaker of the House which would give this District a concrete chance to do something about that emergency. Among other things, it would mean all the energies now being dedicated to defeating him could be dedicated to keeping him honest and true to his values once he is elected. But this is precisely the wrong time to bring in an untested newcomer

				It is certainly ironic that the person that ousted the party boss came from the under represented heavily minority area of the Bronx. I bet the machine that draws these congressional districts will now try to redraw a new district with Queens and the Bronx being separate. If you think of it I doubt that these two areas share little in common except for both being parts of NYC separated by a toll bridge in an area where many people don’t even have cars. This new socialist democrat platform that she won on is more Bronx based and not the ideas of the more centrist Queens based Democrats. How do you feel?

				The most disturbing part of Crowley is that he thought so much of the district he represented in congress that he choose to live in Virginia. He own opinion of his district most be that it is nowhere to raise a family. He got away with this for twenty years! There should be a rule that to represent an area you must actually live with your family in that district. Now the knives will be out to eliminate him as head of the Queens machine. Don’t worry about him, he will finally get to spend all his time in Virginia without ever having to pretend to live in Queens.

				Personally, I&#039;m not actually as far-left as Ocasio-Cortez. I&#039;m definitely more of a centrist. A number of the things she&#039;s called for would in fact mean higher taxes (Medicare for all isn&#039;t going to pay for itself). That being said, however, my wife and I recognize how fortunate we are, especially considering neither of us come from wealthy upbringings. And we believe other people who have yet to reach their goals should be afforded the opportunity to do so. Sometimes that means getting help from your neighbor. So, I’m fine with being taxed if it means we rise as a whole. I vehemently believe in the idea that you&#039;re only as strong as your weakest link, and that a test of your virtue is how you treat the most vulnerable among you. She may not represent MY day-to-day living. But she represents my ideals for how we should treat one another.<br /><br />As for Crowley, I&#039;ve honestly never known enough about him to care. And that&#039;s probably part of the problem. He DID take his re-election for granted. I was made abundantly clear of her stance on issues because of her pervasiveness online and on the streets of Jackson Heights. And to Lilybell&#039;s point, skipping the debate was a gross affront. But I think the nail in the coffin for me was their divergence on campaign funding. Her refusal to take corporate donations aligns with my beliefs 100%. There is WAY too much money in politics. And in a city that is increasingly defined by the whims of REBNY, her commitment to lead a grassroots campaign was a breath of fresh air.

				I have really mixed feelings about this. 1) I don&#039;t follow regional politics enough to know his positions and votes chapter and verse, and 2) it&#039;s clear he sort of blew off the race. It was weird enough that the NY Times editorial board chose to weigh in. <br /><br />I do, however, think he was a pretty good democrat, and that a possible next speaker of the house being primaried from the left is far too reminiscent of the tea party republicans. I hope democrats as a whole do not take that path. <br /><br />I am also more center/moderate than the bernie wing of the democrats. But she will definitely bring a lot to the table, and she now represents us, so will wish her well.

				Well, 65% in this informal poll support her. That is pretty impressive. I after reviewing these election maps find our congressional district to be ridiculous. They should try to have our district to be almost 100% Queens. Now that we have a Bronx based person as our next Congresswoman, I believe tax dollars will be steered to that part of NYC that has nothing to do with Queens.

				I have a neighbor couple both seniors who were out of town on Tuesday and didn&#039;t plan on returning for the election since they were convinced Crowley would win.&nbsp; They returned yesterday evening.&nbsp; They are devastated after supporting Crowley for 2 decades.&nbsp; I&#039;m certain tens of thousands of other loyal supporters also didn&#039;t vote for the same reason that he couldn&#039;t lose.&nbsp; If Crowley should decide in two years to run again these loyal Crowley supporters will be out in full force on primary day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I vote outside the District although I live in Jackson Heights so I have no opinion of either Crowley or Ocasio-Cortez but like everyone else living here or elsewhere USA were stunned by the outcome including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.&nbsp;

				My wife and I are both seniors and have been living tin the district for 47 years.&nbsp; We both voted for Ocasio-Cortez, it is time for a change.&nbsp; Crowley may be a good person, but he doesn&#039;t represent the view of most of his constituents.

				Well said ljr,<br /><br />As George Carlin said, we have all been sold down the river by corporate America long ago. The idea that a 28 year old socialist 1 term congresswoman will change anything when the congress is in Republican hands is fanciful. Even the millionaire Pelosi will ignore her communist/socialist ideas and will give her a coloring book and crayons to keep her busy. The reality is that lobbyists control Washington DC and they control the legislation.

Dems and Libs try for tiny, compromise wins, and get 1 degree to the left. Republicans play the smart game: they go for BIG wins.

				I&#039;ve been listening to Ocasio-Cortez interviews post primary. I&#039;ll continue, but so far I&#039;m hearing sweeping generalities and fanciful ideology. <br /><br />She was a stellar candidate. Now, she is in another league altogether. Her job will not be to convince us--the peeps, but her colleagues on the Hill. I don&#039;t envy her.

				I don&#039;t know what the details are for her plan for free college -- and the devil is in the details.<br /><br />That said, I think it is wrong to cast this discussion as meritocracy vs. whatever -- it&#039;s not really accurate to call Excelsior a &quot;meritocracy&quot;. <br /><br />The requirement to be a full-time student is a real problem for any but middle-class kids. If you have to work 20, 30, or even 40 hours/week, taking 4-5 classes is INSANITY. So <strong>maintaining a high GPA is as much or more about having parents who are paying your living expenses as it is about talent/work ethic.</strong><br /><br />But Federal financial aid, and Excelsior, demands students be full-time. I never got anywhere trying to persuade CUNY kids to go part-time because free tuition was too attractive. And they will really be screwed if the tuition turns to loans.<br /><br /><br />

				Some podcast I listen to (probably Slate&#039;s political gabfest) proposed that we (or really, more centrist democrats (I am one)) frame her platform as a way to frame discussions and move the &quot;Overton Window&quot; of what we as a society can aim for rather than as an actual policy agenda. I think that&#039;s valid. Given the political climate, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s workable to bring up many of her policies as a realistic legislative agenda (it&#039;s like Bernie repeatedly bringing up policies he knows won&#039;t work but just for the sake of his liberal badge - that&#039;s not what I look for in a legislative), but her agenda is very admirable and inspirational. <br /><br />

				Because Congress only works in DC 138 days a year? Living in DC/VA/MD full time makes it more difficult to know what&#039;s going on in their own district to a necessary granular level.<br /><br />But I have mixed feelings - it used to be that congresspeople all lived in DC most of the time and it was less divisive and partisan then because their families ended up knowing each other and their kids went to the same schools and became friends and it was just more collegial in general.

I don&#039;t know why he wouldn&#039;t do that, since he says he is not running against her. The only reasons seem to be (a) he actually is running against her, or (b) he wants to run for another New York office so wants to maintain his residency in NYC.

				^^138 day is legislative days, not the number of days a year our legislators work.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what the critics of Crowley&#039;s maintaining a residence in DC would have considered acceptable. I also find it rather problematic that people are so comfortable criticizing the living arrangements a family decides to make when one member of the family has a job that puts that person in another city.

				&nbsp;I also question this issue regarding attacking Crowley having his family reside primarily in VA to be nearer to him during the<br />school year. This makes total sense to me and I would do the same in that position as apparently many electeds have done<br />in years past. Joe Crowley has been very accessible in my opinion here in the neighborhood and I have gone up and spoken<br />to him a few times myself easily. Also have written emails and received considered responses, most likely by staff, but <br />responses nonetheless. Ocasio-Cortez will surely receive lots of criticism for being the Bronx girl who left the Bronx for<br />&nbsp;better schools in Westchester and Boston but is still the Bronx Latina. As much as I like her running for something, I am <br />still not so sure this battle was the best one to take on and it&#039;s smaller issues like this that seem inconsequential to serving <br />well in this office. I am concerned that the hype around her winning is not going to make it easy for her to acclimate to the <br />demands of this job especially with her relative lack of experience. Just my opinion here.<br /><br />&nbsp;Communication and access are more important to me than where one sleeps at night. Is one of these family choices more <br />right or wrong than the other? Crowley&#039;s son is off to a military academy, I think he said, for college and it sounds like the<br />huge Crowley clan spends lots of time together all summer- here and Ireland among other places. I wish we would applaud <br />both of these families for making decisions that feel right for them.<br />

				The bigger questions that have been lost in all the glowing press about Ocasio-Cortez&#039;s win are: What kind of Congresswoman will she be and what will she achieve given her views?<br /><br />Ocasio-Cortez isn&#039;t just a progressive.

My goal is that she can add credence to progressive proposals &amp; shift the Overton window to the left.<br /><br />As a local leader now, I&#039;d also be happy if she spearheads progressive pushes on the local level too, and to do that she needs a progressive working group. I think that&#039;s happening - I&#039;ve personally been asked to sign ballot petitions for folks running for County Committee that are native to the area, but worked on her campaign. That&#039;s **awesome**.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17961.msg87603#msg87603">Quote from: JH3525 on July 19, 2018, 10:05:21 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It appears that Rep Crowley is on the November Ballot even though he is not actively campaigning,&nbsp; Since he is so well known and respected is it possible that he could win?&nbsp; I believe that just 13% voted in the June Primary but significantly more will vote in November who don&#039;t endorse Ms. Ocasio-Cortez views.

				A.O-C&#039;s platform:<br /><br />socialized medicine - check<br />free higher ed for all, including the undocumented - check<br />$15 federal minimum wage - check<br />guaranteed government jobs - check<br /><br />Then why not free housing for all? why not free food? transportation? free cash/guaranteed income? <br /><br />When is equal truly equal? And what must one--on either side of the coin--give up to be equal?<br /><br />We here in the U.S. live a life defined by our freedoms. We can make choices, both good and bad. Our social and government systems were not set up to guarantee equality, only to level the playing field. The U.S. is the land of opportunity. It&#039;s up to the individual to best exploit his/her options. We are unique in this sense, thus our standing in the world and our appeal to immigrants.<br /><br />There is a big difference between defined text book theory and an individual&#039;s infinite options of actions-reactions to man made systems that on the surface appear to be of the best intentions. We encounter this dilemma daily: law and order or police brutality; education or indoctrination; abortion or murder, to name just a few.<br /><br />You cannot put the individual in a framework as set forth by the DSA and expect it to flourish. Socialism--in the long run--inhibits the individual.

				Venezuela is socialist and it not going well there despite having tons of oil. They seem to not be able to even keep extracting the oil at the same rate. People have no incentive to work hard when government controls the economy. We already have elements of socialism like social security.

				&nbsp;City Colleges could limit the excellent program that they have now called Macauley Honors which is free plus room and board <br />plus a computer, etc. to NYC residents. This would be a boon to many local students who are trying for this scholarship <br />and competing now against others who have greater resources and are from other areas/states for these slots. You may not <br />be familiar with this program but it is highly desirable among many NYC HS seniors as a local option- https://macaulay.cuny.edu/<br />-out of state competition seems unnecessary here.<br /><br />Am also feeling nervous about O-C as she looks very green in some recent interviews.

The tuition is affordable for most at any CUNY which I say having taught there with many students busting it at various jobs. It was the other things that were stretching them beyond affordability- computers, supplies, transit costs, childcare(if needed) and when I hear free tuition that seems like only half the battle won. Students from NYC often do well when applying outside of the tri-state area. This is a leap of faith for some but if we had a better ratio of guidance counselors to students in our public schools, this idea could work. Working in this field has made me want to eliminate some of cruelty of college admissions especially for the poorer students.<br /><br />&nbsp;Back to the original topic- what would be the problem to limiting this one CUNY Macauley Honors program to those who meet the residency requirements and make it need based? There are other Honors programs at CUNY and other local colleges which most of these students could apply for if they made the very competitive cut for this scholarship. The relative affordability of CUNY masks the true cost of attending for some students and a substantial scholarship elsewhere might be a much better deal for them.

				Hi, itsit. My take is, based on conversations with fellow students, $3000+ (approx. tuition at Hunter) is a lot of money for an independent student to come up with twice a year. Lots of us already have computers plus there are computers and printers available at the schools, which we pay for in advance as fees whether we use them or not. Free daytime childcare is also available. I agree that transportation (there&#039;s a new MTA program for the low income) can be difficult to come up with and eating in the City is expensive. <br /><br />In answer to your question to me, FAFSA is needs based as well as many scholarships. If you need and get macauley, the school keeps the fafsa. Other than the undocumented, needy students get FAFSA. CUNY keeps the FAFSA no matter the program, even <em>free </em>programs. There are other programs that assist the undocumented but I am not informed of the details. <br /><br />Now, to quote A.O-C, &quot;I&#039;m not an expert,&quot; but the big problem seems to be for students claimed by their parents on income tax returns. These are the ones that are often billed for tuition whether they live independently or not.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn&#039;t want to see any watering down of merit based scholarships. They are quite specific and standards are high. Those who get them are deserving--my opinion.

				JK, a bit off topic, but not really. My point is that higher ed is very attainable without the A.O-C free-for-all -- if you belong in college.<br /><br />Where I can support A.O-C is for the government to offer <strong>more </strong><em>free </em> school to work programs. The US could use more and better skilled workers.

Crowley&#039;s voting record in congress was OK. But, locally the people he has supported over the years allowed for the piece meal sale of the boro, pushing the kind of LIC style development further and further into Queens. Empty condos that hide foreign money resulting in less affordability for middle and low income New Yorkers.<br /><br />He did not take a stand against Peralta. He stood by him. So, that is an indication of what kind of moral compass he has. He&#039;s an affable guy. That&#039;s what an effective politician is.

				Personally, I&#039;m not really of the mindset that government and politicians are there to fix and provide. Of course they CAN do that but, that&#039;s not actually what the job is per se. So, Im not looking to politicians to help me or my family. But, what I DO expect is that they would have the sense not to undermine the interests of the people in the areas they represent. Please look at the following articles. They are not written by some fringe outlets. They are from a main stream real estate industry magazine. I hope this helps explain more about what&#039;s beneath Crowley affable and friendly exterior.<br /><br />https://therealdeal.com/2016/01/07/right-before-firpta-reform-a-surge-in-real-estate-donations-to-rep-joe-crowley/<br />This legislation enabled the kind of foreign money laundering the Trump org is infamous for. And it&#039;s killing our city.<br /><br />https://therealdeal.com/2018/01/31/steve-roth-apparently-supported-trumps-decision-to-back-out-of-gateway-funding-plan-report/<br /><br />Taking money from people who supported backing out of the gateway tunnel DOES NOT help New York City. This has been in the news again. It&#039;s thought that this tunnel is actually in very dire need of repair and should it collapse one day it could cause major physical harm to people and it would also have a big impact on the cities economy.<br /><br />Also, if you can stomach it, here is Trump bringing up LeFrak and Roth on stage to speak. <br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwBkRr4UlpY<br /><br />So, again, please tell me how Crowley can stand up to Trump when his donors are pals with Trump?<br /><br />Ask yourself who has Crowley&#039;s ear, the good folks of Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst, Corona and LeFrak City. <br />Or Richard LeFrak and Steve Roth.

				This candidate has to be the most unprepared congress person I ever heard speak. No surprise that she worked at a bar with an economics degree. Sadly she will be marginalized by the mainstream Democrats and will be able to offer nothing for her constituents. Since she really cares about the Bronx expect her Queens portion to be abandoned.

A job at a bar where you have the latitude to take time off and still be likely to get back on the schedule seems ideal for someone able and interested in working as an organizer for a presidential campaign and activist (both of which I assume are unpaid).

To what point or number do we have to allow the world’s poor apply for asylum and what benefit is it to our own unemployed citizens? I see this sadly as a never ending problem. <br /><br />As for Diversity Plaza, I hope you enjoy it everyday. I think it was a boondoggle but hey the city wastes money on ridiculous things always then complains how they don’t have enough money to spend. <br /><br />Also: <br />https://nypost.com/2018/10/31/flyers-urge-voters-to-pick-crowley-despite-ocasio-cortez-primary-win/?utm_campaign=iosapp&amp;utm_source=pasteboard_app<br />

				So, to come full circle on the board once again, racist arguments are being made that brown immigrants are poor and uneducated, are emptying their countries to invade the U.S., and are rapists.

				Anyone notice the giant Vote for Crowley banner outside of Four Seasons Fashion on 74th St &amp; Roosevelt this morning? It&#039;s clearly a new banner (it&#039;s white! can&#039;t have been hanging up in that location for too long if it looks that good!), says Vote Nov 6th, and says Working Families Party. Crowley says he&#039;s not actively campaigning. So who is? WFP?

				The choice is for the out of state party boss Crowley or the out of her mind socialist who wants to basically make the US like a new Sweden (as if we don’t pay enough taxes in NYC). Pick your poison.
