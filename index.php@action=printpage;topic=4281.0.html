				Hi everyone, the theme for March&#039;s Food Group on Sunday, March 14th will be 2 for 1&#039;s. All of the choices this month have dual purposes. They are:<br />&nbsp;<br />Legends BBQ and Bar. This is a legendary bbq joint&nbsp; (the former Ranger Texas BBQ) occupies the back area of the bar. <br />Hae Won Dae Korean Restaurant on Broadway which has a spa above it. We would conceivably go to the spa beforehand and meet at the restaurant afterward. <br />Meson Asturia â€“ Spanish restaurant (like, from Spain) which will double as a Flamenco show. This choice is for Saturday, March 13th at 9pm.<br />&nbsp; <br />It should be fun, whichever it is. So send me your vote, and I will let you know by Tuesday who the winner is.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;-------------<br />And if you missed up, here is a wrap-up of our Ambassador Program of Little India with Joseph Aranha.<br />http://iwantmorefood.com/2010/02/26/south-indian-ambassador-wrap-up-joseph-aranha-in-little-india/<br />It was great and I&#039;m happy to have him in the mix of these food groups. Hopefully Joseph will lead more programs in the future when he returns from Japan.<br />&nbsp;<br />--------<br />&nbsp;<br />Lastly! check this out http://www.citizensnyc.org/grants.html<br />&quot;Through New Yorkers for Better Neighborhoods, Citizens Committee offers grants of $500 to $3,000 to grassroots community groups in economically under-resourced neighborhoods to work on creative community improvement projects that bring neighbors together.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />We have this great group of 20 - 30 people every month. There is a lot of potential here to do more for the community. If you had 30 people to do something to better where you live, what would you do? If you had 500 dollars to make where you walk every day better, what would you do? Think about it.

				People, if I&#039;m allowed a vote I would join you for Meson Asturias, mainly for the flamenco, but they also have a vegetable and rice dish that I can eat. Just me - no progeny. Jeanette

				Ole!<br />Crazy night. Jeff couldn&#039;t have PLANNED it better. I&#039;m not a true foodie, so I&#039;ll just give JHLers my take on the event, rather than a true critique of the food.<br />Meson Asturias was accommodating enough, maybe too much, as the March Food Group ended up being uninvited guests to a sweet 15 party and a mariachi band!<br />I enjoyed the flamenco show. They were the Flamenco Latino Dance Company and Studio, 244 West 54th St., 4th Floor btw Bway and 8th Ave. ph: 212-399-8519 website: www.folamencolatino.com<br />While I&#039;m at it, PACONY (where I dance) also has a flamenco class (Performing Arts Conservatory of New York, 35-57 89 St. ph: 718-639-1425.<br />I was pleased to find a vegetarian paella at the top of the menu. I had no complaints. Lovely and filling dinner. I couldv&#039;e drank the Sangria all night as it was flavorful yet light.<br />

				great time. I thought the paella, sangria and flamenco were&nbsp; excellent from the restaurant. <br />but it was really a&nbsp; magical experience when we realized we were in the middle of something much bigger than us. I knew it&#039;d be a party, but I didnt think it would be a sweet 16 or quincenera (sp?). but the best part was the people, again. it seems that every time there are 4 new people.

				I&#039;m still alive. I don&#039;t think the drug warlords are particularly interested in me.<br /><br />I knew about the De Dios assassination, but not the link to Meson Asturias. What a shame. Wonder what happened to the 16-year-old. Disturbing story.<br /><br />Thanks for the history lesson, Mark.

				Coincidentally, we were there on the anniversary weekend of the killing: Manuel de Dios was murdered 11 March 1992, and we were there 13 March 2010.
