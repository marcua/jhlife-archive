				&nbsp;Have you heard that some vaccines are being thrown away because they do not have enough eligible people available to vaccinate within the time frame that the open package of vaccines is good? On NPR today, there was talk of these being thrown out!! Could there be a wait list type of thing where you can get a last minute call that if you get here within say 30-60 minutes, you could get a vaccine that might otherwise be discarded? I would be there in a nano second.<br />

				There are no appointments in Jackson Heights until after the 24th of January although I have no idea whether it will continue to be difficult after that date. Why not make the system 24/7? The system seems to lack urgency and how people without a computer or computer skills will cope with it is anyone&#039;s guess. <br />One of my earliest memories is the smallpox scare in the 1940s when my mother took us (my brother and me)to Junction Blvd to the Health Station there-it still exists by the way-for our smallpox inoculation. No computer sign-ups, just a manageable wait on line. So unlike the present complexity.

				I want to share this amazing local resource. After all vaccine sites online including Rite-Aid&#039;s listed NO APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE for days and continuing, last Wednesday I went to the prescription drop-off window at Rite-Aid on 37th (84th-85th) and asked for an appointment for the coronavirus vaccine. I am eligible per my age. To my shock, I was given one for two days later, Friday, and then they called that morning to ask if I would like to come in earlier than my 7:45pm appointment. So I got it, plus an appointment at the same day/time four weeks later for the second dose.&nbsp; It is the Modena vaccine.&nbsp; A sore arm for a day, and the next day absolutely fatigued and achy. Then, after a good sleep, feel fine. No prescription for the vaccine needed.&nbsp;

				I would like to volunteer as a vaccinator. <br /><br />The objective is to safely get this vaccine to as many as possible as quickly as possible; especially in our neighborhood. NYS DOH seems to only want people with at least some minimal connection to the health field. That is not me.<br /><br />It seems to me that diabetics everywhere are trained to self inject their own meds. Is there any reason why someone like me can&#039;t also be trained and supervised? It&#039;s not brain surgery and this is a war to save lives. I would even be willing to bring it to our shut in neighbors. I&#039;m sure everyone reading this is now having some litigious thoughts. But I would like to see our medical professional&#039;s time freed up to do more important things. And the only compensation I want is a smile and to keep seeing all of your good advice and your complaints here.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; ;)

				I had the first shot last week at Newton High School in Elmhurst. It was abundantly staffed by professionals waiting to give injections. The problem was a lack of vaccines, not staff. There were few people steadily coming in for their appointments timed 15 minutes apart. There was no wait time. <br /><br />Perhaps if the supply becomes steadily available in a large volume they may need people. Don’t forget many doctors in this area are still not in their offices and are available to do this work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps you could call 311 and ask if they have a volunteer list. <br /><br />

				This is a kind gesture but vaccine administration is highly regulated by the NYSDOH. You must be a qualified health professional in order to administer vaccines.&nbsp; Cuomo has expanded the list of qualified professions that can vaccinate (includes health professions students) but a lay person who knows how to self-inject is not among the categories.&nbsp; Vaccination sites must also have a person certified in CPR on site while vaccinations are being administered. (Please see this link for details:<br />https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/vaccination-training) The vaccine also has tightly regulated storage requirements (e.g. hours it must be used within after being thawed) and losing that &quot;chain of custody&quot; over the vaccine by having lay people carry their own vials to people&#039;s homes has the potential to result in people receiving spoiled vaccine.<br /><br />I do think some sites would welcome volunteers who could assist with registering people arriving for their appointments. You could also assist in helping elderly and/or disabled neighbors with appointment scheduling, transportation, and so on.

				&nbsp;Just wanted to share some recent news that last week a number of sites like this one, <br />&nbsp; <strong>NYC COVID-19 vaccine finder (vaccinefinder.nyc.gov )</strong><br />had availability later in the day, sometimes for THAT day! It pays to check mid-late afternoon.<br />I have no evidence but this may be the result of the news stories of places running out of the<br />vaccine, so maybe they are withholding appts till they see within a given day how their supply <br />and appointments match up. This short notice is not easy particularly for older seniors or disabled <br />but hopefully an awareness of this potential and packing a ready-to-go bag along with starting <br />or updating MY CHART online with Health and Hospitals beforehand can set up this possibility.<br />&nbsp;Also you see an appt., book it immediately as they go fast and get out the door!

				&nbsp;A story today on NPR&#039;s Brian Lehrer show featured a younger person who received a Covid19 vaccine which she was not happy about. The reason was that she knowingly took the shot in an underused facility in the Bronx that has not been attracting the designated audience. This person was encouraged by her employer to take advantage of the lack of qualified people in line and justify that the vaccines wouldn&#039;t be thrown away unused. Social media is one of the reasons cited that many eligible people are not getting the news about their availability in the neighborhood. Other methods are needed for outreach such as US Postal Service mail, flyers locally, door knocking as in campaigns or the census as relying on social media for community information just simply isn&#039;t effective in this case.<br />&nbsp;

				I got my first jab at Citifield this past Wednesday. <br />8PM appointment. My spouse who joined to just be there with me left after two hours of queueing outside. I finally went up the escalator at 11PM, queued in another line and around 11:30PM finally sat with someone who took all of my details including documentation confirming eligibility. Another queue and finally received by jab at 12:30AM. <br />My appointment was rescheduled twice due to vaccine delivery delays from the bad ice/snow storms across the nation. They had previously been administering Moderna at this site but now shifted to Pfizer because that is what they were able to secure.<br />I have no context to say if the time it took on Wednesday was typical or not but giving the folks here the benefit of doubt that the confluence of delivery delays, supply issues, staffing shortages, etc. all resulted in extra long delays. <br />The staff, stretched as they were, were empathic coming out to the line from time to time to bring ahead anyone having difficulty standing, wheelchair bound, elderly, etc. <br />I&#039;m hopeful that they are able to scale up the site properly by the time my second jab on the 13th comes around. But I would happily spend another 4 hours to leave this miserable memory of a time behind.

				Wow that is a long wait! My husband and I had our two doses at different schools in the Bronx. The first time, we waiting about 45 minutes outside, and about 10 minutes inside for our mid-afternoon appointments. The second time, it was a solid hour waiting outside in cold weather--but nothing like what you describe at Citifield.&nbsp; Worth it, of course. And yes, they were letting more frail people, those in wheelchairs or on walkers, move to the head of the line.

If not, it&#039;s free &amp; easy to create.<br /><br />You plug in your zip code and it gives all available appointments at nearby stores.

Did all the people over 50 that wanted the vaccine already manage to schedule appointments?<br /><br />I fall in the group that became eligible today and through persistence and dumb luck I managed to schedule an appointment tomorrow through https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/ (https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/) I was also checking the State&#039;s website for availability at Javits Center and Aqueduct Racetrack. https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/ (https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/) On both sites the appointments would appear and disappear as soon as I clicked on them. Extremely frustrating. <br /><br />A friend told me that her brother had luck today calling (877) 829-4692 which I think is NYC Health and Hospitals.

				I also managed to snag one by constantly refreshing the vax4nyc page until I found a nearby appointment. New appointments seemingly appear every 15 minutes, with larger batches on the hour. PITA, but worth monitoring. <br /><br />I just wish there were a way to trade your appointment with someone else to get closer to home. Many appointments that pop up are in the Bronx or Staten Island, and I assume some folks from those boroughs found their appointment in Queens.
