				&quot;But the biggest increase was seen in west Queens — defined by Elliman as Maspeth, Middle Village, Glendale, Ridgewood, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Corona — where the median second-quarter sale price jumped from $400,00 to $548,000, a 37 percent increase.&quot; <br /><br />http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/home-sale-prices-on-the-rise-across-queens/article_7cbd6507-6f4b-5adb-adc2-4be61b4ea367.html<br /><br /><strong>Looks like a bubble folks!!!!!</strong>

				some of the prices i have seen in JH lately are obsurd... I don&#039;t know if they are sustainable. Don&#039;t think we&#039;ll see a huge crash, but I can definitely see prices coming down soon. NYC RE is always in demand, but this isn&#039;t manhattan either.

				When I first started looking at apartments, a broker told me that Washington Plaza was eventually going to change the market. There certainly are a surprising number of 400k+ one bedrooms on the market all of a sudden. I wonder if that&#039;s what&#039;s going on.

				I question how middle class people can afford to pay close to a half a million for a one bedroom apartment. Our neighborhood is composed of working class people who earn working class wages.&nbsp; Who will be left to buy these places when middle class people can no longer afford to pay so much, i.e., our current situation.&nbsp; On the other hand, maybe I am just out of touch with what people are willing to pay for a home.&nbsp;

Where ever you want to compare it to, 400k is just a ton for a 1 bedroom in queens. There are 1 bedroom apartments available for around that price in much nicer areas, much closer to the city, like BK heights or Park slope. Or even IN manhattan if you don&#039;t mind a walkup. Certainly not apples to apples, but still nice apartments in nicer areas.<br /><br />I love JH, I just think sellers are cashing in on prices that are not sustainable. Someone is going to be left holding the bag with those close to half million 1 bedroom apartments.

				Eddie, those co-ops are not compatible to 1 bedroom co-ops in JH or maybe you just happen to select the wrong ones. <br /><br />The co-op on 7th avenue does not provide any pictures of the space / lay out. So the place could be a total disaster but we won&#039;t know unless we actually go view it. <br /><br />The co-op on Remsen street is on a Land Lease --- Nobody should purchase property on land lease. <br /><br />maybe there are better examples, but JH is just catching up with the rest of the neighborhoods in brooklyn. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Frances, the one you&#039;re referring to for $499,000 is unit A45 that&#039;s in contract.&nbsp; The second bedroom is <br />just 10&#039;2&quot; x 7.8&quot;&nbsp; The one that I mentioned was listed just two days ago for $499,000 and is unit B47 and is strictly a one bedroom.&nbsp; &nbsp;A truly magnificent one bedroom was just listed at the Berkeley 77 St for $415,000 an estate sale and is on the 5th floor.&nbsp; Many years ago the owner invited me in to see it soon after he moved in and I was stunned at how magnificent it is.&nbsp; It will sell quickly and is fairly priced.&nbsp; <br /><br />The big advantage with Washington Plaza is you can finance 95% which is perfect for someone low on cash but has the income to qualifty and yes you&#039;re getting a completely renovated apartment.&nbsp;

				An absolutely unscientific Streeteasy survey regarding 1 bedroom flats.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t list Williamsburg/East Williamsburg/ Greenpoint/DUMBO/Brooklyn Heights because they are along the water and are better compared to LIC.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Jackson Heights</strong> has 24 listed:&nbsp; 1 (4%) is above $500,000.&nbsp; 9 (38%) are above $400,000.<br /><strong>Bed-stuy/Bushwick</strong> has 28 listed: 18 (64%) are above $500,000.&nbsp; 26 (93%) are above $400,000.<br /><strong>Crown Heights</strong> has 16 listed: 13 (81%) are above $500,00.&nbsp; 14 (88%) are above $400,000.<br /><br />One can punch holes in that comparison, but it&#039;s pretty clear it&#039;s not even close pricewise.<br /><br />As for the bubble thingy.&nbsp; A bubble is when a particular item is overvalued far beyond its intrinsic value.&nbsp; Are home prices in JH much higher than their intrinsic value?&nbsp; Rental rates are probably the only way to objectively ground real estate prices to inherent values.&nbsp; True, that itself is grounded in the idea that the city remains economically sound.&nbsp; Whether our 1970&#039;s nadir was an aberration or simply part of a repeating cycle, we can reasonably expect the city to have good health in the foreseeable future.&nbsp; <br /><br />So let&#039;s take a $2,000 a month one bedroom rental against a $400,000 one bedroom purchase.&nbsp; Both are on the higher end of what&#039;s going on in JH (though usually, the former is inferior in quality to the latter).&nbsp; While I am sure its methods can be challenged, a NYTimes rent vs. buy calculator determines that in such a scenario, given a $900 a month maintenance, it&#039;s cheaper to buy rather than rent if you plan on living here at least 5 years.&nbsp; <br />http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0<br /><br />I don&#039;t see a bubble or overpricing.&nbsp; I see folks who contributed to the boom in Brooklyn while in their 20&#039;s now in their 30&#039;s wanting to buy and coming out to JH to do it.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t recall ever having been to Bed-stuy or Bushwick, but the aesthetics of Jackson Heights (particularly the historic district) far exceed those of Crown Heights.&nbsp; And yet, prices in Crown Heights are higher.&nbsp; People are just learning about Queens and Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Prices will continue to rise here.&nbsp;

If you scroll down on the columbia brochure and check out the 35th AVE B27...I am fairly sure that is the one being listed. If so it is an EIK flex to bedroom situation after all. Correct?

I live in the building and still had to put 20% down because I bought a renovated unit instead of the one I live in.&nbsp; I think the main advantage with Wash Plaza for outsiders is that there&#039;s no board approval.

And you would no longer be eligible for the insider discount if you didn&#039;t buy your own unit.

				A big reason why appraisals are much &quot;tougher&quot; now is because of all of the bank shenanigans that went on in the run-up to the crash in 2008. <br /><br />During the last bubble, mortgage lenders put pressure on appraisers to approve whatever sales prices they wanted (often inflated) and banks would blacklist honest appraisers.<br /><br />We got a seriously bad appraisal and ridiculous comps when we refinanced a few years back...it didn&#039;t matter in the end but I was pretty angry at the time. But I guess it&#039;s better than all the fraud that was going on!

				One of the biggest changes in lending guidelines, was that appraisals can only be ordered by lenders through third party intermediaries, who randomly select appraisers from their registered pool. It has made the appraisal process theoretically more &quot;impartial&quot;, where no individual or entity could influence the decision. <br /><br />The flaw in this, is that no criteria or a system is set for selection of the appraisers, as long as they are willing to travel to the area where they are assigned a job. Often flawed appraisal reports are attributed to appraisers unfamiliar with the market area or in some cases just lack of work experience. What are the odds of an appraiser who knows the area well and has a decade of experience under his belt will come in with the same impartial opinion as someone new to the area and newly licensed? My gut says - highly unlikely. <br /><br />Also important to note, that although for sale appraisals and refinance appraisals comparative approach is used to arrive at value, appraisers are more likely to come in at sale contract price, than appraisers doing a comparative valuation for a refinance. <br /><br />Remedy? - I&#039;d say firstly it&#039;s important to understand that the lender appraisal is NOT A PRICE INSPECTION! It carries no more weight than one individual&#039;s OPINION of what something is wort for single purpose of managing a lender&#039;s risk. Nothing more. It in no way devalues a property. Property&#039;s worth is determined by what potential buyers are willing to pay for it. <br /><br />Second, most appraisers welcome VALID data. When facilitating appraisals we always make sure to supply the appraiser with recent sale comps, active sale comps, building data and floor plan. This does not guarantee that the appraiser will agree with the data, or won&#039;t go out and try to find more, yet it decreases the margin of valuation errors. <br /><br />Third - though not applicable in case of a refinance, in case of a sale, it&#039;s not taboo to discuss the possibility of lower bank appraisal with a potential purchaser. Especially with the knowledge that it&#039;s been known to happen from time to time. If a buyer is property educated on the market, they will not only stick with the deal in the event of lower valuation, but will press their lender harder to correct it. <br /><br />I hope this is helpful!<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t really get why Berkely units are commanding such high premiums. I think certain buildings seem to go &quot;in style&quot;. Like Carlton House all of a sudden started getting crazy high prices. And those units are rather far from the train and have pretty high maintenance. <br /><br />Meanwhile this unit in Linden Court only asking $269k. Granted it&#039;s only around 700sq feet, but it can be used as a large 1 bedroom with a formal dining room, or even a small 2 bedroom.<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/building/37_34-85-street-jackson_heights/2<br /><br />needs a reno of course, but even putting 30k into it still leaves you at 300k with a reasonable maintenance. I think this apt would function well as a smaller 2 bedroom with two real sized bedrooms vs the 7x7 nook off the kitchen in the Berkely apt.

				I completely agree with you Eddie. But something I think a lot of people weigh more heavily is having an elevator and good proximity to the express train. I know in my JH apartment search it has been a constant struggle prioritizing price vs those two conveniences. <br /><br />This concept of &quot;aging in place&quot; is something I think a lot about. I currently live in a five floor walk up. I am surrounded by people of all ages (literally 30-90!) that have difficulty with the stairs..even on lower floors. I had also recently spoken with a person that lives in Linden Court that regretted buying on the second floor 30-odd years ago. They weren&#039;t even 60 yet! Things like that can tip the scale and make people pony up more cash..especially if they are in it for the long haul. Just my two cents...

				Eddie, I agree with you about prices being very high at the Berkeley.&nbsp; A top floor one bedroom at the Berkeley at 35th Ave was listed a month ago for a staggering $515,000 and its currently in contract.&nbsp; Although, its listed as 950SF, two bedroom flex, its actually a 865SF one bedroom.&nbsp; I own a similar unit at the Berkeley in another building.&nbsp; Also, at the Berkeley 77th St there&#039;s a 2BR, 2Bath listed for $800,000.&nbsp; The identical unit that was listed for $789,500 on the floor above is in contract.&nbsp;

I agree that the location is desirable: not just close to the express train but also in the historic district and close to the businesses in the high 70s and low 80s. Another factor to consider is financials. Perhaps the Berkeley is doing well on that score.
