								<div class="inner" id="msg_6004">Was wondering if anyone saw this Times article on Monserrate April 28, 2008<br /><br />Dysfunction at a Charity That Relies on Council Largess <br />By RUSS BUETTNER and SERGE F. KOVALESKI<br /><br />Hiram Monserrate, a city councilman from Queens, has supplied more than $400,000 in city funds in recent years to a nonprofit agency that has been run by some of his closest aides and whose financial records have devolved into what its current director calls â€œa mess.â€<br /><br />The organization, Libre, which offers a wide array of programs and services for the Latino community, has not filed a tax return for the past two years. It has never registered as a charity with the state attorney generalâ€™s office, as required. And its director says unpaid bills and poor record-keeping grew so problematic that he had to all but shutter Libre last year.<br /><br />â€œLibre is a mess,â€ said Rodolfo Herrera, the director. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a mess because they were stealing money. I think itâ€™s because they didnâ€™t know what to do with paper.â€<br /><br />The millions of dollars that council members dole out to community groups each year rarely received attention until last month, when it was revealed that the Council had been using the names of fictitious groups to park money that it could later spend without going through the normal budget review process.<br /><br />Now a spectrum of analysts, from auditors for the city comptroller to federal investigators to lawyers for the cityâ€™s Department of Investigation, are scrutinizing just what kinds of programs City Council members are financing with the discretionary funds they control.<br /><br />Libre, whose name stands for Latino Initiative for Better Resources and Empowerment Inc., has not been identified as the subject of any special review. But it resembles, in its close ties to Mr. Monserrate, other organizations that have drawn scrutiny. <br /><br />Mr. Monserrate, a former city police officer, negotiated the lease for Libreâ€™s former office, according to the buildingâ€™s superintendent, and one of the groupâ€™s former top executives says he was directly recruited for the job by the councilman. In recent years, its four principals included two women who worked as Mr. Monserrateâ€™s chief of staff and his director of constituent services. <br /><br />P. Wayne Mahlke, Mr. Monserrateâ€™s legislative and budget director, said the councilman had no control of Libre and had believed that its finances and tax filings were â€œin full compliance.â€ <br /><br />â€œThe council member knows Libre provided services to the community and has been a strong organization,â€ Mr. Mahlke said. â€œYes, they went through some difficulties, but that was all their own internal difficulties.â€<br /><br />Libre has told city officials that it provides recreation and education programs, assistance to immigrants and job training for people in Queens. A more detailed picture of the organizationâ€™s activities was unavailable because Mr. Herrera said he was not directly involved in program services and other staff members did not return calls.<br /><br />Neighbors of Libreâ€™s former office in Corona, Queens, said that the office was seldom crowded and that staff members generally seemed to be involved in dispensing advice on how to reach government agencies. <br /><br />Libre has also served as something of a clearinghouse for city funds. Mr. Monserrateâ€™s office said Libre dispensed a third of the money it received to other organizations that the councilman had deemed worthy of support, like the Corona Basketball League and the Colombian Parade Committee. <br /><br />City Council officials said Friday that they knew the names of all the organizations that were the ultimate recipients of such â€œpass-throughâ€ appropriations. The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and the cityâ€™s Law Department made efforts last year to increase the monitoring of pass-through funds, which have been used for more than a decade.<br /><br />But Council officials said they relied primarily on the city agencies that actually expend the money, under contract, to make any background checks on recipient groups. The checks can be cursory, however, as was made clear in an indictment last month.<br /><br />The indictment accused two aides of Councilman Kendall Stewart of Brooklyn of embezzling $145,000 from a nonprofit group they ran. Prosecutors said in the indictment that officials at the cityâ€™s Department for the Aging had initially denied Mr. Stewartâ€™s request to give money to the group, the Donna Reid Memorial Education Fund, after noticing that it was based at the home of his chief of staff. But a subsequent request was approved by the Department of Youth and Community Development. <br /><br />Until November, Libre operated out of a two-story building on National Street in Corona, where neighbors said the organization sometimes held evening English classes but generally opened for only part of the day and rarely had more than three people working. <br /><br />The buildingâ€™s superintendent, Ismail Gaiby, said the office grew more crowded when Libre sponsored voter registration drives, which he said were often attended by Mr. Monserrate.<br /><br />â€œThere were a lot of people coming in and out,â€ said Mr. Gaiby, who also works at an Islamic book company and meat store on the block. â€œThey would go out in the street and register the voters.â€<br /><br />Mr. Gaiby said Mr. Monserrate, accompanied by another man, personally negotiated Libreâ€™s $1,100-a-month rent in April 2005 and delivered the security deposit, but Mr. Mahlke said the councilman â€œdoes not recall having any participationâ€ in that process. <br /><br />Libre was incorporated in July 2003, but it has filed only one tax return, which covered the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. That return showed revenues of $49,750 and expenses of about $25,000, made up mostly of $19,200 in rent and utilities and $3,520 for printing. <br /><br />The return said the group provided â€œstreet activities, including music and cultural enrichment for youth and adults,â€ and â€œback-to-school equipment and activities for young adults.â€ It listed Yoselin Genao, who was Mr. Monserrateâ€™s director of constituent services, as the contact for Libre.<br /><br />The return listed Julissa Ferreras as chairwoman of Libreâ€™s board of directors, and indicated it was an unpaid position. City records indicate that during the time period covered by the tax return, Ms. Ferreras was also serving as Mr. Monserrateâ€™s chief of staff, a post she did not leave until August 2005. Ms. Ferreras returned to work as Mr. Monserrateâ€™s chief of staff last September.<br /><br />In an interview on April 18, Mr. Monserrate gave an account that differed from what the records indicate. He said Ms. Ferreras had not held positions in his Council office and at Libre at the same time. He said that she took the position with the nonprofit only after ending her first stretch with the Council, and that he had required her to leave Libre last year when she returned to work for his office.<br /><br />Ms. Ferreras, Ms. Genao and Mr. Herreraâ€™s computer services company have also been paid for work on Mr. Monserrateâ€™s political campaigns, records show.<br /><br />The bookkeeping issues with Libre surfaced last fall, according to Mr. Herrera, who said Ms. Ferreras recognized that there was trouble with Libreâ€™s books. Javier Cardenas, who was executive director at the time, left shortly after, and Libre began to search for a new director. Mr. Cardenas could not be reached for comment, and Ms. Ferreras did not return calls.<br /><br />Efforts to find a new leader for the organization last October put Mr. Monserrate in touch with Herman Mendoza, who now runs a community outreach program in Corona, Mr. Mendoza said.<br /><br />â€œHe offered me the positionâ€ of executive director, Mr. Mendoza said. â€œI was working for an insurance company, and he said, â€˜Hey, thereâ€™s an offer if you want to work, since you do a lot of work with the community.â€™ â€ <br /><br />But Mr. Mendoza said he found that he was Libreâ€™s only staffer and left after three weeks. <br /><br />â€œThey couldnâ€™t pay me a salary, so I had to get another job quick,â€ he said. â€œI guess there was no funding.â€ <br /><br />Mr. Herrera, who had been Libreâ€™s treasurer since its inception, said Ms. Ferreras asked him to take over as director in November. He immediately moved Libre into the small office in Jackson Heights where he runs two other firms, a Colombian radio station and a nonprofit organization, Latin Technologies, that offers technology training. <br /><br />Latin Technologies has received $120,000 in city funds since 2004, most of it in discretionary awards from Mr. Monserrate. <br /><br />In a telephone interview on Friday from Colombia, where he was visiting, Mr. Herrera said he planned to file Libreâ€™s delinquent tax returns by the end of May. He said Libreâ€™s only existing city contract called for it to distribute $32,000 of a $40,000 award to other community groups. <br /><br />Mr. Herrera said he was unable to access Libreâ€™s records because he was out of the country. Though he was the treasurer during the years in question, he said he did not monitor the books, a job that he said fell to Mr. Cardenas.<br /><br />â€œAll weâ€™ve been doing is paying bills from the past,â€ Mr. Herrera said. â€œLibre doesnâ€™t have employees. We are just cleaning up Libre debt.â€<br /><br />Reporting was contributed by Daryl Khan, Sharon Otterman, William K. Rashbaum and Ray Rivera.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_11950">More on the Libre situation<br /><br />The New York Times<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/nyregion/19libre.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Group Spent Cityâ€™s Money, but Has Not Shown How</a><br />By RAY RIVERA<br />Published: October 18, 2008<br /><br />A Queens community group that is under investigation for possible political work on behalf of Councilman Hiram Monserrate could not produce paperwork to show how it spent nearly $250,000 in city money that the councilman had directed to it in recent years, city audits show.<br /><br />The group, Libre, which was overseen by Mr. Monserrateâ€™s chief of staff, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in discretionary funds from the councilman over the past five years to provide English language instruction, job placement assistance and other services to the immigrant and Latino community in the Corona area of Queens.<br /><br />But the group was unable to produce time sheets, expense receipts, canceled checks or board meeting minutes to document its expenses for the two fiscal years, 2006 and 2007, examined in the audits. Libre told the auditors in an e-mail message that it had shut down.<br /><br />Investigators for the Queens district attorney this spring began reviewing allegations that the organization had spent a portion of its time promoting Mr. Monserrateâ€™s political career.<br /><br />In May, as part of a separate review, private auditors hired by the cityâ€™s Department of Youth and Community Development began examining how Libre spent grant money the agency gave it. The money had been directed to the group through Council earmarks secured by Mr. Monserrate. Based on the audit findings, the agency will now seek to recover Libreâ€™s grant money, according to Ryan Dodge, an agency spokesman. He declined to say how that could be done with the group shut down. The audits were released by the city in response to a Freedom of Information request filed by The New York Times.<br /><br />In interviews in the spring, Rodolfo Herrera, who was then the director of Libre, acknowledged that the agency had bookkeeping issues, but he did not indicate that records were missing or that the group had plans to shut down.<br /><br />Instead, Mr. Herrera said he planned to file delinquent tax returns for the group and hoped to find a new headquarters and build a community center with $2.1 million in capital funds earmarked by Mr. Monserrate. That money was approved but never appropriated by the city.<br /><br />Mr. Monserrate, who is now running unopposed for the State Senate, referred questions about the accounting to his chief of staff, Julissa Ferreras, who was Libreâ€™s chairwoman during the period examined by the audits.<br /><br />â€œSheâ€™s the person to have the conversation with,â€ he said. â€œI wasnâ€™t the director. I donâ€™t know what paperwork was there, what books were there.â€<br /><br />He said he did not understand how the group got the money in the first place if it did not submit paperwork and receipts to the Youth and Community Development Department. â€œHow would the agency pay out on any contract without paperwork being submitted?â€ he said. â€œThat doesnâ€™t sound right to me.â€<br /><br />Ms. Ferreras, who is running to fill the seat Mr. Monserrate will be vacating on the City Council, said in a brief telephone interview on Saturday that the records should be in Libreâ€™s offices. â€œI personally donâ€™t keep the records,â€ she said.<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em></div>
