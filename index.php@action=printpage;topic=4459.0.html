				Hi jhlife,<br /><br />My wife and I are about to enter contract on a Junior-4 in the Carlton House. From everything I&#039;ve seen (three visits to the apartment itself and 3 years of living on the next block), the building is attractive inside, maintenance staff are active, and the outward appearance of building and grounds is high priority. I know there were past issues with ATM Management, but now they are using All Area.<br /><br />Appearances can be decieving, as they say, so I&#039;d like your feedback on life in the Carlton House before we take the final plunge. We&#039;re also planning to take an available garage parking spot, so if you park at the Calrton, please share.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />P.S. - We will be renovating, including some structural changes to the apartment. Please share if you have experience in getting your renovations approved by the board. We&#039;ve hired an architect.

				Hi potential new neighbors,<br />My girlfriend and I have been living at the Carlton House since December. Everything you have seen is true. The doorman is great and the staff is excellent. We do have a parking spot which we received quickly through the super. When concerning renovations, when we moved in we only painted and did minor things so we didn&#039;t need approval from the board. By the way, is your apartment on the first floor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good Luck!

				It&#039;s true.&nbsp; The flip tax is 10% of purchase price and you can&#039;t add on the costs of renovations.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned since it&#039;s unlikely you&#039;ll see a huge profit in 3 to 5 years.&nbsp; It&#039;s the owner&#039;s who purchased one bedroom&#039;s in the $20&#039;s and 2 Bedroom&#039;s in the 60&#039;s (I know of both) who need to be concerned.&nbsp; I lived at the Charlton for 2 years and left behind $11,500 (profit was $115,000) and I had no complaints.&nbsp; I knew going in of the 10% flip tax.&nbsp; Roosevelt Terrace nearby has a 25% flip tax.&nbsp;

				I found out that the ten percent is on profit only.<br /><br />In other words, if we buy a co-op for $250,000 and later sell it for $280,000, the flip tax would be $3,000, not $28,000.<br /><br />That seems very reasonable.

				Sorry, I meant 10% of PROFIT.&nbsp; Most don&#039;t consider this reasonable when you have to add in broker commissions plus other closing costs such as transfer taxes.&nbsp; I sold in two days using Craigs List so avoided brokers fees.&nbsp; Yes, Roosevelt Terrace is 25% on profit also.&nbsp;

				Yes.&nbsp; It&#039;s a post-war building in pretty good shape.&nbsp; Like most buildings (and houses) at some point we will have to upgrade the electrical.&nbsp; These buildings weren&#039;t meant for all our high-tech toys.&nbsp; We have a good board and our finances are pretty good.&nbsp; No maintenance increase this year and we got a new management agency.&nbsp;

				Hi, everyone.<br /><br />In considering buying into a co-op, and in particular with Jaxboro Corp./Carlton House, an important question needs to be raised: does the co-op (the Jaxboro Corporation) OWN the ground that the building sits on, or is it LEASING it?<br /><br />If it&#039;s LEASING it (and from whom? from a wealthy family/heir? or from the City?), then there may exist a great RISK 20-odd years down the line (when the assumed 99-year lease is up) in being WIPED OUT as the shareholder and ending up a renter - at best - in one&#039;s &#039;own&#039; apartment.<br /><br />Does anyone know if Carlton House/Jaxboro corp owns the ground or is leasing the ground?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I asked a friend who is a real estate lawyer. She says the information is in the Offering Plan.<br /><em><br />&nbsp;&quot;You need to read the coop offering plan and ask the question of the managing agent or realtor.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a secret.&nbsp; Just something important to know about.&nbsp; And it certainly could be a financial risk.&nbsp; The ground lease could be renewed for a large amount of money which would raise the maintenance substantially.&nbsp; It has already happened in Manhattan, but what usually happens is that the coop buys the ground.&nbsp; Which also costs a lot of money and raises the maintenance....&quot;</em>

				I understand the sponsor only converted the Carlton to coop in the 1980s (1988 I think). While it was built/completed in 1947 (not 1946 as is seen often on boards), it&#039;s an 80s coop, not a 1940s coop. Someone told me the construction of the building was slow due to wartime issues and building materials issues so I think any initial ground lease must have been signed even before the US entry in WW2.

				As has been stated before on this thread - The Carlton House does not have a land lease.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are many buildings in Jackson Heights that became coops back in the 80&#039;s and they do not have land leases either.<br /><br />As many on this board know, The Carlton House was the first post-war(1947) cooperative completed by the Queensboro Corporation.&nbsp; The massive development did not do well, so they rented out the units instead.&nbsp; Their next and final coop, The Greenbrier(1949) was on a much smaller scale.&nbsp;

				I did exhaustive due diligence last year before my purchase - and if there were a land lease this would have come up. My lawyer - who has been with me through three prior home purchases and is very kind and thorough - would have sat me down to explain the implications. And my mortgage bank would definitely have voiced concerns!<br /><br />I think you are worrying about something that&#039;s not an issue. <br /><br />I love this building. Designed by Philip Birnbaum in his early career as an architect and who later went on to design buildings including Trump Tower, the floor plans are large and gracious and make excellent use of interior space and light. I hear zero noise from my neighbors due to the thickness of the walls and the tower structure (east, west, center are separate wings). Our doormen and porters are excellent. There&#039;s a &quot;package room&quot; where they hold our deliveries while we are at work, indoor parking for $100 extra a month - we didn&#039;t have to wait for it - and storage - I am still on the list for that.<br /><br />I personally do not begrudge a few hundred dollars in holiday tips to a staff who make my life so much more comfortable on a daily basis. :-)<br /><br />We are completely satisfied with our purchase. I recommend the Carlton without hesitation.<br /><br />

				Roosevelt Terrace doesn&#039;t own their land, but it has the right to renew the lease under the same terms, once the lease is up (original lease was for 99 years). So, I don&#039;t think a land lease is necessarily a worrisome thing, if the terms were thought out with what happens at the end of the lease?

				I&#039;ve noticed a run-up in prices at the Carlton House.&nbsp; Is this mainly due to MCP Properties&#039; marketing of the building and the units?&nbsp; If so, they really know what they are doing.&nbsp; Even in Daniel Karatzas&#039; last JH real estate report, he made a special mention that the increase in pricing for post-war elevator coops within the historic district (vs outside the district) was due to sales of large apartments at the Carlton.

				I noticed that too. We closed last January and prices are definitely higher here now. <br /><br />Almost all of the units available right now I see are sponsor units - most have had kitchen rehabs. But I think it&#039;s Douglas Elliman, who is handling them. Or at least that&#039;s who has been in the building showing them.<br /><br />The &quot;history&quot; links are all broken on Streeteasy. And there are multiple entries for the same units so kind of hard to tell what&#039;s going on with them.

				I saw a 1 bedroom listed for $415k recently... insane! Agree, great marketing job.<br /><br />I think the CH apts are beautiful and I would have bought there myself but the high maint, no pets and trek to the train killed it for me.
