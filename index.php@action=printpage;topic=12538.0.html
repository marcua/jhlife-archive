				Wanted to share our latest article on Jackson heights pricing projections, which corolates with an article dating back to May 30th 2013. Direct link: http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/2015-jackson-heights-real-estate-pricing-projections/<br /><br />---<br /><strong>2015 Jackson Heights Real Estate Pricing Projections</strong><br />October 19th, 2014<br /><br />You may recall the article we published on May 30th 2013 titled Unemployment Improves, Jackson Heights Real Estate Market Soars, where we projected quote: “median price for renovated Jackson Heights one bedroom units will reach $300,000 + in the coming year and two bedroom units will trade in the area of $450,000.” With that prediction proving accurate I believe now is a time for a new projection.<br /><br />Based on everything we are experiencing first hand, we now believe that towards the fall of 2015 median price for renovated one bedrooms in Jackson Heights will reach $350,000 and median price for renovated two bedrooms will reach $525,000.<br /><br />Though we take pride in our consistency of being in tune with our local market, our projection from May 30th of 2013 was based strictly on professional instinct. Today we are projecting based on many other markers already present in our marketplace and in a much healthier economic environment.<br /><br />www.JacksonHeightsListings.com (http://www.JacksonHeightsListings.com)<br />

				I remember 4-5 years ago, when we were buying 1 BR, 2 BR was around 320-330K. Today when we want to buy 2 BR, it is almost impossible to find one below 400k. It is scary to even think it will be over 500k in coming years.

Things like the BID and the move and opening of locally established businesses have been in public eye, so we are basically all in the same position to speculate :) Your guess could very well be better than mine.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=12538.msg59258.html#msg59258">Quote from: European on October 19, 2014, 09:07:26 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I remember 4-5 years ago, when we were buying 1 BR, 2 BR was around 320-330K.

That same apartment, we issued a value opinion of $525,000 in today&#039;s market. <br /><br />I also want to be crystal clear: our projections are based on premier TURN-KEY units, as this is the market sector that we specialize in. It is also our experience that the renovated units are the ones that command the higher premiums and drive our market. So by outperforming expectations, they pull up values and set new benchmarks for units that require renovation.<br /><br />www.JacksonHeightsListings.com &nbsp;(http://www.JacksonHeightsListings.com)<br /><br /><br />

				I guess other people have weighed in on this, but I have to admit to being puzzled by the rising prices presented as good news. It seems it&#039;s good news for real estate brokers and for people who want to leave. Otherwise, if we&#039;re owners aren&#039;t we planning to keep living in the apartments we own? So how does this help? If we&#039;re not already owners, we are being priced out of being able to buy for the first time. And those planning to sell, but who want to stay in the neighborhood, are being priced out of being able to move. <br /><br />I know, I know; change is a part of living in NYC. But I was naively hoping that all the problems with the commercial rents would at least have this silver lining; i.e., giving us all a few more years of the neighborhood we chose to move to in the first place.

From the perspective of a renter and a prospective purchaser in a rising market I can even identify with your concern. We&#039;ve all experienced a down economy and have been negatively impacted one way or another. Home owners who bougt in mid 2000&#039;s saw their equity deflate and folks renting were scared or unable to purchase due to a downward spiraling housing AND job market. Folks who are relying on their current home as one of their retirement nest eggs, are feeling the relief today, and folks who are thinking about buying in this low interest rate enviroment are encouraged that they may see appreciation in the new home that they purchase. <br /><br />Low interest rates and rising prices are not a full-proof formula or a suggestion as to what to do. It does however foster an enviroment that allows opportunity for more home buyers than what we&#039;d seen in years passed.

Maybe I&#039;m in the minority, there.<br /><br />(To partly answer my own question: I&#039;m not so dense that I can&#039;t imagine scenarios where the extra equity would be useful: if you have health problems down the line, and want to be able to sell your apartment to cover nursing home expenses, or want to have more to leave your children.)

				SamInNY: let&#039;s please agree that equity in a home you own is a good thing, at least as apposed to negative equity :)&nbsp; <br /><br />I think you brushed on an important topic, and let me add something. I think that because majority of homes in Jackson Heights are coops, folks moving in are buyers, meaning people who are not in it short term. So their thought process which is then followed by a board screening is quite vigorous on both ends. I think it&#039;s safe to safe that they aren&#039;t &quot;dating&quot; the town and hoping to change it into &quot;marriage material&quot; they are actually &quot;marrying&quot; the town. :)<br /><br />Many of our past buyers are now on boards and garden commertees, and we keep close touch with them still, and bump into them in town regularly. <br /><br />In a nutshell more jobs and appreciating values are better in my opinion, than the opposite. <br /><br />

I can&#039;t see it as a bad thing for anyone currently owning their home. I do agree that people should look at their house/apt. as a <em>home</em> instead of an investment. If you&#039;re happy living there and plan to stay, it kind of doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s worth 10% more than it was last year.

SHEPARD<br />THE crossroads of the world has moved eastward about a half-dozen miles from its traditional intersection at Times Square, to central Queens. Like continental plates overlapping on the unsettled global surface, the most unlikely mix of newcomers, from Colombians to Koreans, from Indians to Uruguayans, has established communities virtually beneath the flight paths of the airplanes that brought these settlers to their new world.<br /><br />Here, along the axis of Roosevelt Avenue, which forms the border of Jackson Heights (on the north side) and Elmhurst (on the south), there is a stir of business and pleasure in a babble of tongues. Rest stops for the serendipitous between 71st Street and Junction Boulevard, under the unprepossessing shadow of the overhead No. 7 line on Roosevelt Avenue and on the more attractive surrounding streets, are in the shape of a generous assortment of restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries, stocked with food that ranges from the parilladas of the Rio de la Plata to the masala dosai that recalls life on the Ganges.<br /><br />&quot;Indian visitors first coming to New York want to see three things: the Empire State Building, the United Nations and 74th Street,&quot; said Abraham Mammen, whose Delhi Palace Restaurant is on 74th Street, on a block that reaches north to 37th Avenue and is almost completely lined with Indian entrepreneurs. &quot;On a summer weekend, it is like Bombay.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Mammen&#039;s New York India, which includes a spillover on 37th Avenue, according to his count, has 17 jewelry stores, 21 sari shops, 12 grocery stores, 5 tailors, 7 travel agencies and 7 restaurants (only 1 of which -- his, he says -- has a liquor license). What is particularly striking about this busy subcontinental enclave inserted among Koreans and South Americans and older American-born generations is that few if any Indians live in it. It is all commercial and the Indian custom (as well as other consumers) comes from outside the neighborhood.<br /><br />The Colombians, however, do live there, and along with them is a Spanish-speaking population that patronizes the dozens of restaurants that serve in a South American way.<br /><br />&quot;When Colombians make a date to meet in Jackson Heights, they say, &#039;I&#039;ll meet you in little Chapinero,&#039; the name of a barrio in Bogota,&quot; said Bernardo Duque, director of the Colombian Independence Festival, an annual event in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park organized by the Colombian Civic Center. Last year, the event drew 500,000 spectators and will be repeated on July 20. The center of Colombian Queens, he said, is at 82d Street and Roosevelt Avenue.<br /><br />&quot;Our cooking was considered a novelty 20 years ago when our restaurant opened,&quot; said Felipe Diab, the Ecuadorean co-proprietor, with Pedro Tatarian of Uruguay, of La Fusta, a popular Argentine steakhouse at 80-32 Baxter Avenue, near Broadway, two blocks south of Roosevelt Avenue. &quot;It was a commercial neighborhood then, and the Cubans were the first Latins to come to Queens.&quot;<br /><br />The strange alphabet most predominant here is in the squares and circles of Korean, rather than in the brushstrokes of Chinese that are more common to Flushing, on the eastern reach of Roosevelt Avenue, past Shea Stadium. A walk through the doors of the New York Union Shopping Center, 71-17 Roosevelt Avenue, is an instant journey to what might be a large, modern department store in Seoul. It is easy to gain the impression that virtually everything in the store, including the customers, is Korean (the finely designed glassware and traditional cooking utensils certainly are, even if many of the appliances are Japanese or of other nationalities).<br /><br />This Queens cultural melange is a far cry from the settings of immigrant or foreign settlement in Manhattan. For the sightseer, there is not the titillating exoticism of mean, and narrow, streets, of quaint people living in quaint poverty in quaint tenements. Some of the handsomest and earliest of garden apartments are clustered north of Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, buildings imaginatively ornamented and designed during the late 1920&#039;s and early 30&#039;s, frequently occupying entire blocks, bordered with grassy or bushy lawns that make the streets seem wider than they are.<br /><br />In both Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, where the apartment houses are architecturally newer and less elaborate, there are streets and streets of one- and two-family dwellings, ranging from modern brick to Archie Bunker wood, stone and shingle. Although the ethnic varieties stand out in these comparatively bland surroundings, the population is generally of English-speaking New Yorkers, many of earlier immigrant stock: the Italians, Irish and Jews who had settled in the area with the coming of the Roosevelt Avenue elevated to Manhattan in 1917. Outside of the stores specifically catering to ethnic specialties, the look of the main streets, like 37th Avenue and the few blocks of shopping along 82d Street, which resembles a modern mall, would be indistinguishable from the center of any busy small town in the United States.<br /><br />A closer look indicates that looks may be deceiving, and that the cosmopolitan complexion is reflected not only by proximity, but also by crossing the lines.<br /><br />&quot;You used to have kosher delis and you still have some very good Italian restaurants around here,&quot; said Dr. Barton Appel, a podiatrist who has had offices in Jackson Heights for 35 years. His taste may not have changed but it has broadened to an appreciation of the corvina, a haddocklike fish served in a butter-and-lemon sauce at Inca, an Ecuadorean restaurant at 85-01 Roosevelt Avenue.<br /><br />The grocery store at 37-59 82d Street is a case in point. The carefully displayed fruits and vegetables offer for Latin palates cayote, red or black beans, outsize Colombian yams and the somewhat pumpkinlike squash (or squashlike pumpkin) called calabaza. A step away, the Asian taste is presented with tofu, bean sprouts, Chinese cabbage, Chinese noodles and Chinese pears, each attractively packaged in a small white-paper basket. That&#039;s togetherness in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Click link above for full article

				European, we just bought a 1100 sf 2br for under $300k in January. If a buyer is open to post-war, there are still some to be found still at that price point.

There are still 2 bedroom (maybe Junior 4) apartments in Jackson Heights under 300K. I just did a search of 2 bedroom apartments on redfin.com, the 11372 zipcode comes up 17 apartments that are priced under 300K. As one is already aware of, none of them are close to the 74th street express subway station, many of them are located bordering corona (such as South Ridge, North Ridge).<br /><br />Please talk to local realtors, some of them have pocket listings. I wouldn&#039;t recommend Agent Armen, as he is focusing on the turn-key apartments and pushing the price on new highs.<br />

Of course, a higher price will eventually translate to higher property tax and higher rent, which tends to push out first renters and then owners of moderate income to another neighborhood to stretch their dollars longer .&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks Shelby2 for the NYT article. Yeah, nothing has changed much for the past 23 years. Some positive change is the Travers Park and the Farmer&#039;s market. It&#039;s still too early to know how the 37th road plaza affects the quality of life for the residents. The NYT article mentioned Koreans,&nbsp; I hardly see any Korean stores north of Roosevelt ave. <br /><br />

These are not by any means MEDIAN prices, but they are a clear indicator as to where we the prices are headed. <br /><br />Sellers currently are more adventurous about testing the marketplace, and as marketing experts we are expected to, and DO, rise to the challenge.

				We bought a 1000+!sq ft 2BR - not a junior 4 - in the Carleton last year for $268k. <br /><br />Yes it needed a gut reno!<br /><br />We looked at those 1-could-convert-to-2s in this building. They were nice. But in a year they jumped from 250k to 400-ish? <br /><br />That&#039;s pretty remarkable.<br /><br />I still can&#039;t click through to past history for this building on streeteasy. The links are broken. And there are double entries for all the &quot;in contact&quot; units -- that oddly show different number of rooms and square footage.<br /><br />Weird.

The link for history is broken just for your building (Carlton House). I looked at the active listing of this building, all are by Douglas Elliman. My suspicion is that Douglas Elliman can pay some money to streeteasy to have the history of this building blocked. Of course, one can always use acris to find out the sale price, just a little bit cumbersome.

				I got a reply to my form submitted at streeteasy.com. <br /><br />They fixed the broken sales history link for 34-41 85th Street:<br /><br />https://streeteasy.com/building/34_41-85-street-jackson_heights#tab_building_detail=2<br /><br />There&#039;s still the problem of duplicate entries. But now we can see what&#039;s going on with recent sales. Here&#039;s a snapshot:<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/E66Sw7n.jpg)<br /><br />A slew of sales, especially in oct-dec of 2014. <br /><br />The X, O, and B lines are 1000+ sq ft 2BRs + balcony. Those closed in the $430k range. <br /><br />The M, our line, is a similar 2BR layout but without a balcony. Those went in the $380-390k range.<br /><br />The priciest 1BR was 3H that sold for $333k - H&#039;s are large 1BRs + balcony. The balcony in those has the old metal french doors off the living room. Most people will find those more charming than the ones that have the small side door off. <br /><br />Average size 1BRs in the 700sq ft range like 6W and 6K sold for $232k - which is more like what we were seeing when we bought our 2BR. <br /><br />The 1BR that is on the market now for $410k is almost 1,000 sq ft + balcony. And the floorplan shows it&#039;s convertible to 2BR (by walling off the eat-in area of the kitchen). The description says: 4P Is Our Most Unique One Bedroom Floor Plan. With Enough Square Footage For Two Bedrooms. <br /><br />So they are reaching to get a 2BR+balcony price for a Junior 4 + balcony. And if this were Manhattan, I think we&#039;d say that&#039;s a common practice. It will be interesting to see they get this price for a junior 4 in this building.<br /><br />
