				I sort of remember a toy store there but not the name. After WW-II, an former Marine opened a store named Hobby Hub on the other side of Roosevelt Avenue and 82nd Street where he sold model airplanes and cars and helped us get started or finished. He also sold model engines for the planes and cars (gas operated) which were too expensive for this pilgrim but some of my pals had them and we went to the lots for experimental flights (some immediatly crashed) and the frames were made of balsa wood so, we started all over. Wonderful memories. Also, can still remember Whalen Drug Store on 82nd Street, between 37th Ave. and Roosevelt Avenue, on Friday when my older sister and I could get a tuna salad on white toast and a malted milkshake for $0.50 each. Can anyone imagine?

				The store was Gerstenhaber&#039;s -- a&nbsp; wonderful old creaky wooden floor toy store. They had a great assortment of models, toy soldiers and Matchbox/Corgi cars. Half the store was bikes and baby carriages I think.&nbsp;

				Yes...that&#039;s it Hank!&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp; I was a model car nut and they had a great selection there along with paint and glue and everything you needed. Also remember getting a crystal radio there that I grounded on my bedroom radiator. A wonderful old creaky wooden floor toy store....that is exactly my memory of it!&nbsp;

				Other cool toy stores were the one on 37th across from the Post Office - they had Corgi, Matchbox and those small British&nbsp; soldiers&nbsp; - and a hole in the wall place in the 74th Street Station. If you entered from the 37th Rd entrance you&#039;d hit it.
