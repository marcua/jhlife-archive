				How much do you get paid per hour? You who asked the question, not Handyman-B. <br /><br />I&#039;d pay the equivalent of $35/hr. That is about what a carpenter/contractor charges per hour.

You and I both know that these Jackson Heights folks have a much higher per capita income than Astorians. Just compare the difference in the numbers of coops and condos between our 2 communities. The last stats I read showed that the largest number of Astoria rentals were to the roommate generation. <br /><br />I live in a 140 unit rental building in Astoria with a Building Manager, an on-site Building Super and three on-site Porters. NONE OF WHICH HAVE ANY COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. When there is a building-related problem the wait time can be as much as 4 weeks to get your point across . . . unless the rushing of boiling hot water running out from under your front door can help get the point across for you faster! I tip based on the promptness of the repair. NEVER on how long the repair takes. Hell, if my floors get ruined, they are going to have to replace them for nothing, if they hadn&#039;t waited as long as they did. And in the case of my kitchen floor that got ruined when a hot water pipe broke, I simply deducted the cost of the floor replacement over the next 2 months rent. I had to report my non-stop flushing toilet to the DEP to get that repair expedited, and I did NOT tip for that repair. <br /><br />None of us have a money tree in their backyard, and I especially resent the hand out, waiting for the tip, trying to make conversation with me, when I have had to make 12 phone calls, put 4 notes under doors and spoken directly to building personnel on-site, and still had to wait 2â€“4 weeks just to get a leaky faucet fixed.<br /><br />If I need something done that is not building-related, I call Handyman-B. At least I know it will GET done, get done correctly, and I don&#039;t mind being given a rate to pay when I call on him. The fee is always fair and reasonable, and the problem is rectified correctly.

				Since I&#039;m a data junkie, I had to look this up.&nbsp; The numbers are a bit out of date, because they come from the 2000 Census.<br /><br />HCT12. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN 1999 (DOLLARS) BY TENURE<br /><br /><table class="bbc_table"><tr><td>Tenure </td><td> 11102 </td><td>11103</td><td>11105</td><td>11106</td><td>11372</td></tr><tr><td>Owner Occupied </td><td> 50,156 </td><td> 48,898 </td><td> 51,424 </td><td> 51,989 </td><td> 50,236 </td></tr><tr><td>Renter Occupied </td><td> 32,021 </td><td> 35,907 </td><td> 35,582 </td><td> 31,630 </td><td> 35,893 </td></tr></table><br />ZIP Code 11103 is interesting... of this group it has the lowest median income for owner-occupied housing, and the highest median income for renter-occupied housing.&nbsp; &nbsp;But other than that, the areas seem pretty similar.<br /><br /><br />But anyway, back to the main point at hand, it seems that different buildings have quite different arrangements.&nbsp; In my co-op, although there is a large staff, the rules state that the Super and other staff are not responsible for repairs within the apartment.&nbsp; If we want them to help with installing an air conditioner, replacing a faucet, etc., we negotiate a price with them and pay them to do the work on their own time (and yes, I tip too, if the work has been done well).&nbsp; &nbsp;I never questioned this policy, since this is the first co-op I have belonged to, but it does make sense to me.

				You know, when I move into a new building, I always consider &quot;making nice&quot; with the super to be one of my moving expenses. I am NOT handy, and I know that by the time I am unpacked, and settled in, I will have asked for help at least a half a dozen times.&nbsp; So the first thing I do when I move in, is offer $100 to the super, and announce, politely, with a nice smile, that I am going to be a royal pain in the butt.&nbsp; So over the next couple of weeks, when I need someone to help hang a hook rack on the back of the bathroom door and someone to help me move the china cabinet &quot;just over here to see how it looks&quot; and someone to hang this mirror right there... I mean there...wait...how about....<br /><br />I&#039;ve had great supers in the past three buildings I&#039;ve lived in, but I always started off on the right foot.&nbsp; Like Todd, I&#039;ve been in apartments in which repairs inside the units are NOT the super&#039;s responsibility, and therefore I expect to pay for help.&nbsp; I tip for each visit...but in addition to offering some cash right when I move in, I also make sure I offer a holiday card with cash at least once a year.&nbsp;

				Thank you Todd, for finding the statistics on this. I think the assumption is that because many of the buildings in Jackson Heights are more owner occupied than renter occupied our incomes on average are higher.&nbsp; However, I just had friends try to find a decent apartment to rent in Astoria, and crappy one bedrooms were going for 1800 at minimum.&nbsp; They found a beautiful two bedroom here for the same price.&nbsp; My husband and I couldn&#039;t even find a reasonable apartment to buy in Astoria under 300 thousand.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t see how NYCMac gets the impression that Astoria&#039;s average incomes are lower than ours.&nbsp; It seems to be that the way the real estate market and rental market are going there, only people with higher incomes will be able to live in Astoria.
