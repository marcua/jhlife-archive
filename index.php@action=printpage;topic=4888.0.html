				Sounds like a great concept but bottom line many folks are just too busy to cook a small meal much less enough to share.&nbsp; Those of you that live in buildings that have resident&#039;s who cook often I can see where this would not only be fun but a great way to get to know your &quot;neighbor&quot;.

				I get the concept Jeff but most people I know have a hard just putting together a meal period much less preparing a large amount. &nbsp;Cooking in general is very intimating for many people. In my group of friends I, along with possibly two others cook at all. &nbsp;I wonder just how successful these groups are. &nbsp;I have a feeling there is much enthusiasm in the beginning but it loses it&#039;s charm over time.....too gimmicky to last for long.....I&#039;m just saying!<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4888.msg31992.html#msg31992">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on June 25, 2010, 05:43:31 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">that&#039;s the whole point. cooking for one or two doesn&#039;t always seem worth your time, but if you can do a big group once a week, it&#039;s worth it.

				I was so intrigued and excited by this article too. I did notice that most of the members mentioned were people who worked for food magazines and large multimedia organizations, which would mean that they would be people more likely to be very organized and have significant culinary expertise. Not guaranteed of course, and not to say that other people, say social workers for instance, would be just as capable :)<br /><br />I am in no way an experienced cook, but would love the chance to learn how to make a large scale meal. And the thought of cooking one big meal, instead of 7 small meals, sounds great.

				Feeding yourself well has to be a priority. &nbsp;You&#039;re putting food in your mouth and expecting your body to run off this stuff. &nbsp;You can&#039;t make excuses for something so elemental as three meals a day. &nbsp;I saw the article in today&#039;s NYTimes in the Money Section on antibiotics in animal agriculture and am so further committed to feeding myself from food sources that I have knowledge of. &nbsp;FarmSpot rules!<br /><br />And so do cooking clubs. &nbsp;Why not here in Jackson Heights, people? &nbsp;The best food and the best people are in this lovely neighborhood in this great borough of the best city on the planet.

				I would totally be up for doing this! But I think the problem is making sure your group has similar cooking &quot;styles&quot; as you do.

				I was in a 30-person vegetarian cooking co-op in college.&nbsp; Seven teams of four people each cooked dinner on alternating nights, and a two-person team cooked Sunday brunch.&nbsp; The skill and commitment of the teams varied widely, but overall we ate quite nicely.&nbsp; Weekly shopping trips were a hoot!

				As the author of the NY Times article (and a newbie to Jackson Heights Life) I just wanted to say that our cooking co-op group is going strong after almost a year. Happy to talk more about the benefits, and how we keep it going, if anyone is still on the fence about starting a group. It may not be for everyone, but it&#039;s really added to the quality of my family&#039;s lives (and meals!)<br /><br />-Laurie Woolever

				i think it&#039;s a great idea...obviously, people with different restrictions might need to branch off in different directions, but it could be fun. everyone loves a pot luck...and chances are, just about everyone could cook once a week. i&#039;d totally be into getting involved should someone want to get one rolling.

				I love this idea!! Much better than trying to find a Dream Dinners set up.&nbsp; I grew up in a big family and always cooked big and loved to cook.&nbsp; Ever since I moved up here I&#039;ve only had myself or the occasional boyfriend to cook for and I find that its rarely worth the time and effort. So my cooking and diet has gone waaaaay downhill over the past few years.&nbsp; I&#039;ve now made it a point to cook a big vat of something healthy-ish at the beginning of every week and freeze it for lunches. Something like this would mean that I could stick to the schedule but not have to eat the same thing every other day, and that would really make my mother quite happy. <br /><br />I&#039;d be happy to stick to whatever dietary guidelines a group might decide upon; it would help branch out my cooking. <br /><br />Also, we&#039;re all obviously getting fed somehow currently so it doesn&#039;t have to start out as a weekly obligation of 5 course meals for 12 families&nbsp; :o<br /><br />It could start out just on like the third Sunday of the month with X (number of participating individuals) preparing X number of freezable, easily re-heatable, one-course meals and see how it goes.&nbsp; If its different buildings everyone could take a turn being the Hub for the swap - set a time (with perhaps an hour time window) bust out some wine and cheese and throw around ideas for the next month&#039;s menu then everyone be on their way<br /><br />I&#039;m ridiculously busy for the next several weeks but I&#039;d be happy to be the coordinator if we want to aim for a start date in late March (say swap date of Sunday, March 20?) - just PM me your dietary restrictions, number of mouths in your family and an email address or best way to contact you.&nbsp; I&#039;ll put together the restrictions and, assuming there is any food left to cook, issue the final instructions to everyone a few weeks before the swap date so you&#039;ll have time to come up with a dish and we can circulate a menu... I&#039;d say let me know by end of February if you want to participate.<br />
