				https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/dining/chinatown-outdoor-dining-coronavirus.html<br /><br />At the end of this piece in today&#039;s Times, Pete Wells describes a new food court coming to JH at 37th Road and 74th St., designed by David Rockwell. The current outdoor court in Chinatown, just opened, is a model. <br /><br />This could really make that congested part of JH so much more visually coherent and would of course be a boon to local food vendors. May it happen!!

				Diversity Plaza itself would be great as an outdoor food court. <br />As is 37th Rd as well for outdoor dining.

				It would be a boon to the neighborhood if that area could be transformed.

				&nbsp;Please, please. It&#039;s kind of scary now with no attempt at social distancing to find a path to enter the subway from Diversity Plaza.

				&quot;The new seating on Mott Street is Rockwell Groupâ€™s sixth outdoor-dining installation, and the first one shared by several restaurants.<br /><br />Another communal dining cluster is scheduled for later this month. It will radiate from the intersection of 37th Road and 74th Street in Jackson Heights, in the part of Queens that had the highest concentration of illness from Covid-19. Like the businesses of Chinatown, the Nepalese, Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants on those blocks have been slow to exploit the new outdoor dining rules.&quot;<br /><br />Really cool news.

				According to Eater.com, 37th Road between 74th and 75th Streets has been officially added to the list of blocked off streets for restaurants under Friends of Diversity Plaza.<br />https://ny.eater.com/platform/amp/2020/8/14/21369419/open-streets-outdoor-dining-nyc (https://ny.eater.com/platform/amp/2020/8/14/21369419/open-streets-outdoor-dining-nyc)

				Today I ordered food from Angel Indian, to try one of their new meat dishes for lunch.&nbsp; When I got to the street at 12:15, it was closed to traffic, and full of tables, and every single table was occupied with people enjoying themselves. <br />Honestly it was refreshing to see this and I was happy to see the restaurants busy.&nbsp; <br />

				I don&#039;t know if anyone saw, but Queens Neighborhoods United is still trying to be relevant and is trying to start a petition to shut down the planned food court idea surrounding Diversity Plaza.<br /><br />https://www.instagram.com/p/CD_yEKTDtm7/?igshid=pwg7mc8knnh2<br /><br />This group honestly just has nothing better to do, don&#039;t they? <br /><br />I&#039;m glad people are using the space.

				The Mott St concept is also coming to Woodside Avenue according to StreetsblogNYC:<br /><br />&quot;Fresh off the heels of transforming car-congested Mott Street into an open-air dining piazza, New Yorkâ€™s top restaurant architect will bring the concept to two Queens neighborhoods that have suffered greatly from the economic downturn linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />Starting this weekend, DineOut NYC â€” a restaurant-industry collaboration with starchitect David Rockwell â€” will create public dining areas at 37th Road and 75th Street next to Diversity Plaza in Jackson Heights, and on Woodside Avenue, between 76 and 78th streets in Elmhurst.&quot;<br />https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/08/20/mott-haven-in-queens-car-free-restaurant-streets-to-open-in-jackson-heights-and-elmhurst/ (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/08/20/mott-haven-in-queens-car-free-restaurant-streets-to-open-in-jackson-heights-and-elmhurst/)
