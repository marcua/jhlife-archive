					Also, Buzz, your assertion that &quot;... if this was normal then there wouldn&#039;t be laws against it,&quot; is reamrkably naive.&nbsp; Is that so? Law only comes into play to suppress &#039;abnormal acts,&#039; really?&nbsp; I suggest you think back and consider the prohibition laws, and Jim Crow laws against interracial sex.&nbsp; In any case, NYC has pretty much broadcast that though these laws may be on the books, little effort will be made to enforce them.&nbsp; So there&#039;s your new reality.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

					First of all, I&#039;m not &quot;telling&quot; anyone how they should react; merely suggesting that if a desired change is not likely to take place, it&#039;s better to factor in reality and live with it, minimize its effects on you (&#039;wearing&#039; an ipod, for me, is an excellent anit-honking remedy).&nbsp; I&#039;m a long-time J.H. resident myself, not a &#039;newcomer&#039; like you assume I am.&nbsp; And I remember honking from the moment I&nbsp; moved in.&nbsp; I grew up in NYC, am in my 60s, and remember honking vividly from Bronix childhood and in every neighborhood in which I&#039;ve lived.&nbsp; Like you, I&#039;ve lived in many cities, nationally and internationally.&nbsp; Sure, there are a few pedestrian and bike-oriented cities like Amsterdam where honking in limited.&nbsp; But that, in my experience, is not the urban norm.&nbsp; Everywhere else, honking seemed to me as pervasive as it is here, if not worse.&nbsp; So yes, act to minimize it if you can.&nbsp; But there comes a point at which struggling woith those windmills becomes futile.

					Doubt that will ever happen.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably vote it street in J.H. least likely to go pedestrian. But if it should, it&#039;ll only mean that traffic now heading down that street will be re-routed to others, where new complaints will arise.&nbsp; Nothing is free.&nbsp; 78th between 34th and Northern was made pedestrian.&nbsp; That made a lot of people happy, and a lot of people on 76th (who now had the old 78th traffic heading southbound down their street) unhappy.&nbsp; No free lunches, it seems, when it comes to traffic, urban life.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					The city has told us that it will no longer enforce honking laws, issue tickets, etc.&nbsp; Is that really a surprise, given how pervasive honking is, how unenforceable the rules/laws?&nbsp; Now, Erica, you point to the myriad of problems here -- blocking the box, delivery hours, jaywalking, double parking.&nbsp; yes, all problems.&nbsp; And hopefully each issue can be addressed, problems minimized.&nbsp; But this works best if added to another approach -- just learn to better tolerate such disturbances.&nbsp; They are -- fundamentally -- an unchangeable thread of the fabric of urban life.&nbsp; The problems cited are not unique to J.H. They are city wide, they are national, international.&nbsp; Sure, we may want our neighborhoods to be quiet pedestrian zones, locomotion limited to feet and bicycles.&nbsp; But that ain&#039;t going to happen, so best to try to accept and adjust.&nbsp; Also, for pure pedestrians, it may be useful to try to imagine what it all this looks like from a driver&#039;s point of view.&nbsp; Car and truck and bus drivers are, and will remain, part of the mix, after all.&nbsp;

					You have a well-developed sense of sarcasm; I appreciate that.&nbsp; But educate us all then, mrose, tell us all what &quot;normal&quot; city life is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in 10 large cities in my life and the last adjective I&#039;d ever apply to urban life is &quot;normal.&quot;&nbsp; Sorry, there is one &quot;norm&quot; that probably applies to all cities, and that is that its residents are apt to loudly bitch about aspects of urban life they hate and would love to see go away.&nbsp; So you have lots and lots of company...

					If you view this as a &quot;nightmare,&quot; you have been living a very sheltered (and obviously un-urban) life indeed.&nbsp; Virtually any European or Asian big city, with its vast array of motorized two-wheelers and honking cars is noisier than any NYC neighborhood.&nbsp; You have only two realistic options: 1) learn to tolerate it, because it&#039;s not going to significantly change, or 2) move.&nbsp;

					If 73st affects your delicate sensibilities so much, why don&#039;t you just avoid it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sick of all the wimps and wimpettes who bitch about every little thing in this neighborhood that doesn&#039;t live up to their yuppie notions of orderliness and propriety.&nbsp; You all need to get funked up!&nbsp; 73st is vibrant and alive and real and colorful and human.&nbsp; One of you mentions how shocked you are when you have guests who are exposed to the horrors of this street. Me, I always make a point of bringing my guests straight smack into it.&nbsp; And they love it, smells and all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sure it could be cleaner and less smelly at times.&nbsp; But urban life is urban life.&nbsp; So stop bitching and learn to enjoy and tolerate life, in all its scents and sights and sounds.&nbsp; There are plenty of places to live a bland and santized life.&nbsp; Jackson heights, thankfully, is not one of them.&nbsp;

					First time I had a serious computer problem for which I needed service.&nbsp; Called 2 others who gave me a lot of talk and fees, and insisted on coming over right away, despite the fact I had guests.&nbsp; Then called these guys -- Nerd Force.&nbsp; And they were fantastic.&nbsp; Listened to me, came up with a simple solution on the phone (partly because they knew my computer).&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried it, their fix worked.&nbsp; No visit needed, no money spent.&nbsp; And good help and courtesy.&nbsp; So when I <strong>do</strong> need a visit, and do need to spend money, I will call NerD Force first.&nbsp; I suggest you do the same.&nbsp; Very glad I saw their post on this site....

					My father, deceased for years, was a stamp collector.&nbsp; I held on to his stamps, but now would like to give them away.&nbsp; And I want to give the stamps to <strong>a young, new stamp collector </strong> (if they still exist), or to several, rather than to a seasoned older collector looking for a windfall.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; Possibly steer me to someone who fits the bill?

					It always smelled unseemingly.&nbsp; Let&#039;s kick Sabini upstairs to a bureacratic post to make room for Monserrate to run unopposed for state senate.&nbsp; This is a guy the Queens democratic organization was eagerly and unanimously backing <strong>even after</strong> two separate scandals arose involving improper (and if anyone even bothered to deeply investigate, probably illegal) funnelling of earmarked money to cronies and political operatives.&nbsp; The fish gave off a stench but our local pols only smelled roses.&nbsp; Now he&#039;s become Hiram the slasher, the guy who not only assaults his g.f. but then also endangers her by taking her to a distant hospital rather than one blocks away, one, incidentally, which is reputed to have an excellent emergency room.&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember when we had our so-called &quot;community meeting&quot; on crime at the Jewish center?&nbsp; Walk in and you see a huge banner, HIRAM MONSERRATE.&nbsp; Stay and listen, and you see this &quot;community&quot; meeting is no more than a self-serving opportunity for Hiram and his local pol pals to fluff up their feathers.&nbsp; Queens Democratic politics needs reform.&nbsp; It&#039;s stale.&nbsp; No wonder Hiram sought a State senate seat.&nbsp; Albany is a cesspool where pols go to wallow in the muck, immune to reality.&nbsp; Everyone talks about fixing the economy.&nbsp; But the economy goes south because we elect negligent and corrupt pols who don&#039;t look after our real interests.&nbsp; We elect sleazy bullies like Monserrate instead of...&nbsp; At least (let&#039;s cross our fingers) we seemed to get the White House right.

					In this case ridicule is appropriate.&nbsp; Here&#039;s someone who tells us how very harried she is, then goes on and on and on detailing her petty outrage over a trivial transgression.&nbsp; &nbsp;She tells us she has precious little time, and yet she spends it venting.&nbsp; Then spends even more time trying to have us feel sorry for her and explaining just why she is venting.&nbsp; And on the basis of her miguided and petulant outburst, another thin-skinned J.H. resident who believes (stupidly) that &quot;the customer is always right&quot; tells us that -- goddarned it -- she ain&#039;t ever going back to Tomo either.&nbsp; Dem self-righteous yuppies sure do stick up for each other.&nbsp;
