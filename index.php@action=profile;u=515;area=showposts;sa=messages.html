					sorry to hear about this.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest going to the NYPD 115th community council meeting. it&#039;s the 3rd Tuesday of every month (so April 20, 2010)<br /><br />Meetings: The Community Council meetings are held the third Tuesday of the month (except July and August) at 8:00 p.m. at the 115th Precinct, 92-15 Northern Boulevard. <br /><br />the 115 Commanding Officer is there and you can let him know about your concerns. Local politicians, or their staff, are there too. Our precinct is geographically huge and I think sometimes they forget that the lower crime areas of the 115 still need attention.&nbsp;

					re unionized staff - a lot of the small buildings (like 10 units per building) have part-time supers who receive very little salary, but receive free rent. So if there is a couple who are supers, often one person also has another job, because even with free rent, who can live on $300 a month?&nbsp; The part-time super usually handles garbage, snow, sweeping the sidewalk and general maintenance of the common areas of the building. He or she is usually not expected to do anything inside your apartment, like any repairs or projects. He or she is also an employee at will who can leave at any time or be fired at any time. There is often a lot of turnover for these positions. <br /><br />Whereas in the larger buildings with unionized staff, the staff are full time and professional. They usually receive free or discounted rent as well as a real salary. They take care of the garbage, common areas, snow, etc but often can also make repairs or do projects that the building might otherwise have to hire someone to perform. Like the super in my unionized building repaired the radiator in my apt and installed child gates. The staff is part of the Service Employees International Union and negotiates with the Realty Advisory Board, which is an industry organization that represents apartment buildings.&nbsp; I think the last strike was in 1991, but there was almost one in 2006. So if there is a strike looming, even if the employees of&nbsp; your building are satisfied with the management/board of your building, they will strike if their union votes to do so. <a href="http://www.nysun.com/new-york/strike-may-soon-greet-new-yorkers-looking/30589/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nysun.com/new-york/strike-may-soon-greet-new-yorkers-looking/30589/</a><br /><br />As someone who has lived in both types of buildings, I have better services in the building with the full-time unionized staff, but I pay more in monthly maintenance.

					bank is a good guess, but there&#039;s a Commerce at 70/Northern, 74/37th and 94/Northern ... seems like a 4th in JH would be too much especially since they have to build vaults and safety deposit boxes.

					according to filing on NYC DOB building information system, they are removing the underground tanks as well as the canopy sign, but Mobil still owns it.&nbsp; maybe they want to sell but to make sure it&#039;s not a gas station in its next life since there is still a Mobil at 76/Northern?<br /><br /><a href="http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;passjobnumber=410095855&amp;passdocnumber=01" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;passjobnumber=410095855&amp;passdocnumber=01</a>

					I heard that Dines Farms was passing on the site which they had been considering (the former Betel furniture store on Northern b/w 80 &amp; 81). There is now an empty long-distance phone place next to that empty store as well.&nbsp; I heard that the former Betel is going to become an &quot;upscale Mexican&quot; restaurant. I just hope they get a liquor license quickly and I&#039;ll be there!

					This is all mildly amusing to me as someone who has owned 3 apts in JH since most of the names are newer brokers in JH -- just as an aside, for many years, almost all sales in the historic district of JH were handled by Maire Breen and Mercedes Langan and they listed in NY Times sunday only (never online) ...&nbsp; we bought two apts through Mercedes Langan.&nbsp; She was very kind and was trusted by the coop boards. I have not seen anything listed by her recently. I think the internet did her in as an agent. read this article &amp; weep over the prices . . . <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DE1F3DF932A35751C1A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DE1F3DF932A35751C1A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink</a> <br /><br />When we were selling, we tried selling through Ms. Langan, had trouble around 9/11 and ended up selling ourselves. The second apt we sold ourselves also, but were about to sign with Virgil Cannatella, a broker with Douglas Elliman who lives in Hawthorne Court and is really great. One thing to consider if you are selling is what the advertisements for your apt will be and who will pay -- a broker may not have to pay the costs out of his/her commission if he/she works for a large agency.&nbsp; An agent for a smaller company may not want to spend a ton on advertising out of their own budget. As I recall, Elliman was going to pay for a set amount of NYTimes ads.<br /><br />I have never met him, but Michael Carfagna is selling an apt upstairs from me and he seems good for sellers -- he prices things aggressively high but also shows the apt often and does tons of open houses. <br /><br />We bought our newest apt through someone who just happened to have the listing but is not based in JH.

					this is listed under events too, but there is an upcoming historic weekend with tours of the various buildings and a map. Info cut &amp; pasted from <a href="http://www.jhbg.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhbg.org</a>. <br /><br />Self-Guided Tour of Private Interior Gardens; Saturday, 6/7; noon to 4:00 pm; $10 (Rain date: 6/14; all other events rain or shine)<br />These parklike interior gardens, surrounded by 1920s-era garden apartments, are only to the public only once a year. Visit up to nine gardens at your own pace, following a map included in your ticket. Tickets can be purchased in advance or in front of the Community Church the morning of the event.<br /><br />Escorted Walking Tours of the Historic District; Sunday, 6/8; meet at noon at the Community Church (southwestern corner of 82nd Street and 35th Avenue); $10<br />Tickets for this event must be purchased or reserved in advance.<br /><br /><br />FWIW, the name of the bldg says more than the location -- it also signifies whether it&#039;s with garden access or not, with or without elevator (top floor + elevator = high price, higher maintenance; top floor + stairs only = cheaper price, lower maintenance), whether it allows sublets (as a co-op owner, you are a lessee), full-time or part-time super, and managed as one big building (100+ units) or&nbsp; as 10 - 14 unit building. If you know what&#039;s important to you, you will be able to rule in and rule out buildings. In groups of buildings like Elm Court or Hawthorne Court where each bldg is managed separately, each bldg can have different maintenance and down payment requirements. In large buildings like the Towers or the Berkeley, all apts have the same maintenance per share and the same down payment requirements.

					I used to live on that block and we parked for a few years at the lot on Roosevelt b/w 78 &amp; 79. Your car will get dirty from being under the 7 and they have to maneuver it in and out for you (open 24 hours as far as I recall). I had considered renting a private garage but the alleyways seemed kind of sketchy to me.&nbsp; After a while, we realized that our &quot;failure rate&quot; (as measured in parking tickets) was less than the monthly parking rate, so we stopped paying for parking and just paid tickets here and there. I am not sure how much the lot is now, because I haven&#039;t parked there since 2005 and the rates have gone up.&nbsp; Also, you will probably not have that much trouble parking if you use your car every day and are not parked during alternate side of the street parking anyway.&nbsp;
