				Has anyone tried the Jackson Heights flavor &quot;Mangodesh&quot; made by 5 boroughs? http://www.5boroughsicecream.com/flavors.html<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried it yet, but find it odd that the ice cream is unavailable (as pints anyway) in this neighborhood especially when we have a flavor named after us!&nbsp; The website lists several stores in Manhattan and a couple in Astoria but nothing here. I was thinking of getting it for a dinner at my home but it seems I will have to go out of my way to acquire it.&nbsp; I had heard at some point that Espresso 77 carries it or planned to carry it but I&#039;m not sure that helps me unless they sell pints.<br /><br />

				Espresso 77 does sell pints, but every time I&#039;ve asked they&#039;ve been sold out of that flavor.&nbsp; Instead, I&#039;ve tried the South Bronx Cha Cha Chocolate, which is amazing.&nbsp; But be warned: it is not mildly spicy, it is <span class="bbc_u">very</span> spicy!

Gives â€˜hot chocolateâ€™ a whole new twist.&quot;<br /><br />As long as you know what you&#039;re getting into, it&#039;s quite yummy.&nbsp; But best eaten in combination with &quot;cooler&quot; flavors.

				The heat comes as a surprise at the end - and it packs a punch!<br />We have samples if you want a taste before you commit to a pint - just ask whoever is at the counter and they will give you a spoonful.<br />Julie

				Thumbs up on the Mangodesh!&nbsp; We were scraping the bottom of the container - should have gotten two.<br /><br />(edited to add that I asked the 5 Boroughs owners to add Espresso 77 to their retail locations list on their website and I see that they have now added it.)
