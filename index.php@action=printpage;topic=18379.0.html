				In the past month or so there appears to be a young Bengali guy, maybe 19 years old, who&#039;s been hanging around 37th Ave near the library and sometimes on 82nd St...etc.<br /><br />He appears to be totally lost...I am not sure if it&#039;s mind-altering medications or simply that&#039;s who he is.<br /><br />Is there a number to call for the Desi folks...for some Desi social welfare group...like other minorities have (like the Jewish/Chinese/Latino groups have)...to perhaps look after him?<br /><br />Or a number to call for the city to work out his story?<br /><br />It seems a helluva waste of a life to be hanging around the street&nbsp; alone like that.&nbsp; Something&#039;s not right...<br /><br />Tonight for instance he is sleeping on a bench on 82nd Street snuggled onto a giant stuffed pink teddy bear. <br /><br />Though that image is, of course, very &quot;only in New York&quot;... perhaps he does require professional help. <br /><br />Interestingly, his clothes are not typical homeless.&nbsp; In other words, he looks pretty clean. <br /><br />

				he may not be homeless in the strictest sense. i&#039;ve known people with mental and emotional illnesses who have families nearby that they sometimes or usually live with. it&#039;s still sad, and it would be ideal to find help, but there&#039;s no way to force someone to take that help unless they&#039;re a clear and present danger to themselves. <br /><br />it&#039;s good of you to take note, and care enough to try to think of an intervention -- if one is needed.

				Asking the question again.<br /><br />Is there anyone on this board with knowledge about any Desi social welfare organization?<br /><br />Or if such an organization exists?

				&nbsp;Am not sure either about homeless youth as I think there are many more here than we are certain of but I would try to contact<br />CHAYA who have an office around the corner from PS69 same side of street. They have a large staff with many young people <br />who may know more about his story and if he need help, how best to get that for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;Thanks for your neighborly concern.

				Thanks.<br /><br />Perhaps the Chaya organization has health professionals who might know how to approach this situation.
