					PRE-Natal Yoga at Mimi For Me Yoga- Saturdays at 2pm<br />TEL: 718-505-9642<br />76-11 37th ave, JH 2nd Floor<br /><br />Yes it’s true, it&#039;s never too early to connect! <br />Many, doctors, mid-wives, and women have stated that Yoga helps better connect moms-to-be and their soon-to-arrive babies. Yoga also assists with a better transition into the months of pregnancy and helped prepare for the big day! Yoga Asanas, or poses are ways of moving or holding the body in different positions to gently stretch, and is a great way to keep the body active and supple while pregnant. You’ll practice postures that work on the reproductive organs and pelvis to allow for a smoother pregnancy and an easier more focused and enjoyable child birth. While concentrated breathing (prananyama) is a powerful way to ensure an abundant supply of oxygen is reaching the fetus, while infusing you with some extra “life force” as well! Yoga breathing will also condition a better mind and body connection, that’s going to help a great deal on that special day! A little meditation will offer a heightened state of awareness, a greater bonding with your baby to be, while helping address both on a psychological and an emotional level any fears or concerns moving forward. Lastly, but certainly not least, ahhhh...., deep relaxation learn it now, because you’ll need it later! The effects of a yoga practice during pregnancy can make for a smoother pregnancy, relatively easier childbirth and a quicker restoration of body post labor.
