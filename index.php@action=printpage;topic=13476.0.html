				I am happy to have a clothing store in the neighborhood that I may actually shop at .&nbsp; On the other hand, I am fearful of the impact of having another big name corporation moving in on local merchants&#039; territory and the potential consequence of driving them out of business by driving up the rents on commercial space and usurping their customer bace.&nbsp; I really love the mom and pop shops and restaurants and would hate to see them replaced by corporate stores that have no connection to our neighborhood.

				Just for the record, Banana Republic is owned by GAP.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would guess they saw the success of their factory store and thought to add another of their businesses to the street.<br /><br />&nbsp;Hey, who knows, maybe they&#039;ll take over the old movie theater with an Old Navy? At that point we could just rename 82nd St. Gap Ave!!!

				&nbsp;So it looks like&nbsp; based upon the posters outside the store is not an actual banana republic, but banana republic factory.&nbsp; Like our gap factory, it&#039;s the economical version of banana republic.

				I&#039;m aware the factory outlet stores have lower quality than the actual stores, but I still have found some nice clothes at the Banana Republic Factory outlet store in Deer Park.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy about this store coming in to JH.&nbsp; I found ABC unpleasant to shop in.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not exactly sure which local store -- beyond maybe one women&#039;s shop on 37th Avenue (by the liquor store I think) -- would possibly lose customers to a Banana Republic factory store. And even that women&#039;s shop is questionable as the clothing there seems to be for a decidedly mature customer.<br /><br />We don&#039;t have great clothing stores in this neighborhood. Want a dress that&#039;s 100% polyester, ill fitting, and sure to pill up in two washings? Looking for horrific patterns? You got it. <br /><br />One good thing I&#039;d say about ABC Outlet clothing selection is that if you browse frequently, you can sometimes find good stuff. I still have Danskin capri workout pants I spotted at there, and am routinely saddened that I lost a second pair I left in a gym bag on the train. I&#039;ll buy some of the light sleeping shorts there and an after shower mumu. But I haven&#039;t found anything decent clothes to wear outside the house wise there is years.<br /><br />On another note, I visited the new location of ABC on Junction the other day. What a difference! Two floors, with home stuff upstairs. I imagine it&#039;s only a matter of time before they add racks and pack the first floor just as badly as it was on 82nd (and on Greenpoint), but since I mostly pick up a couple home items there, it was paradise.

				I guess you have to accept 82nd street and Junction blvd as commercial districts - which they definitely are meant to be. I&#039;m personally happy with shopping in other neighborhoods to keep these places out of my neighborhood. Very happy to go to the city or Queens center mall for big box stores. There is rarely an emergency when I need banana republic merch. <br /><br /><br />I just hope people pack Lockwood when it opens bc that&#039;s about as local as you can get .

				The challenge for Lockwood, or any specialty store in this neighborhood is value vs. quality/experience.<br /><br />Sometimes I want one, sometimes another.&nbsp; <br /><br />I bet the owners of Lockwood are banking on a demographic shift toward those bloody mary swillin brunchgoers.<br /><br />The other week I was at Diamond Dogs in Astoria (great bar. And yes I asked the owner to consider opening a bar in Jackson Heights) and a friend of mine actually said, &quot;Did you hear they are opening a Lockwood in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; i think your neighborhood is going to be the next one to &#039;blow up.&#039;<br /><br />So is Lockwood cause JH to turn the &#039;hip&#039; corner?&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see.

				I don&#039;t want to start another retail gentrification battle -- really! -- but I don&#039;t totally understand the need to have all my shopping needs met <em>in my neighborhood</em>. Grocery stores and pharmacies, sure. But the traditional urban model, before the advent of shopping malls, was to go downtown to buy clothes and other goods. It seems to work pretty well. We can be in Herald Square or SoHo via the subway pretty quickly and have a much wider selection of shops than any typical residential neighborhood could ever hope to have. I like the idea of neighborhoods each having a distinctive flavor and even occupying a specific retail niche that draws people from all over (like the dwindling ones in Manhattan for flowers, diamonds, perfume etc) or our own 74th Street.

				I&#039;ll take this as a sign of better things to come- this is better than vacant storefronts. This is better IF Banana Republic allots budget to repair the old building façade while maintaining integrity. Commenting on the actual store is besides the point, it&#039;s what the profile of this store means in this setting (factory or no factory outlet). <br /><br />The problem with &quot;mom and pop&quot; shops is not only rents which appear to be a big issue, it is also the city in general. Don&#039;t put this all on the landlord.....btw if you were the landlord of a commercial property, you would want to bring in the highest return on your investment too.<br /><br />NYC makes all businesses pay UBT tax which is a slap in the face tax on top of all income taxes. The chunk of money small businesses and self employed individuals can put into building their business, paying their rent and hiring employees is significantly affected by this tax. It all stems back to the same root of all evil- millionaires not paying the proper percentage on their pied a terre investement properties- so NYC looks to the next victim- small businesses. It&#039;s a vicious cycle. <br /><br />Like it or not &quot;Mom and pop&quot; shops are on their way out. Not just because of rents. NYC does not do enough for small businesses to give them a fair chance

				wk, if you haven&#039;t heard of Woolworth&#039;s, they built a modest headquarters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworth_Building) nearby.&nbsp; The company has evolved a bit over the years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Woolworth_Company), but they still have a store on 82nd Street: Foot Locker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_Locker)<br /><br />ECG, thanks for pointing out Kresge&#039;s and Woolworth&#039;s.&nbsp; Looking back at some of the JH history threads, there were a lot of other chain stores along 82nd Street at various times: Chock Full O&#039;Nuts, Florsheim Shoes, Fields, Genovese Drugs, Horn and Hardart, Barricini&#039;s.

				Would love to know how much of an increase in rent Banana Republic is paying compared to former tenants? This is the crust of the problem. Sure, landlords want to maximize profits but how much of a premium are they going to put on rents that are already too high? In the end the consumer pays for it in high prices. I understand this is a cheaper version of Banana Republic but the seeds are being sown. It will spread. Some will see this as an improvement but others, like myself, see the mom and pops as the reason why NYC is special. Would like these Mall type stores to stay in the mall.

				I can understand the concern over rising rents, but I for one am glad about Banana Republic, even if it is only a &quot;Factory Store.&quot;&nbsp; I like their clothing (better than the Gap, which I never shop in), and they do increase the quality of merchants in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I actually view it is a positive step, and certainly better than another wire transfer/cell phone/slutty clothing store.

				Although I don&#039;t shop at BR ... I have to say WOW. What a difference it makes visually.

The store is nice just super crowded on a Saturday. A lot of items were 60-70% off! Line was about 50 deep but moved relatively quick (20 min) with 6 clerks. Nice addition to the area
