Also, that&#039;s DoT&#039;s decision anyway, and does not fall under the purview of the people who have signed the petition. Besides, there are plenty of parks with road ways in them (i.e. Eastern Parkway). In fact, the petition makes some pretty broad, nonspecific requests to the powers that be in city government and DoT who are preparing a proposal for 34 OS, and does not propose eliminating parking. <br /><br />What unscrupulous people did was misrepresent an advocacy group&#039;s proposal to reduce street parking in NYC by 25% as a plan for 34th Avenue.

The reason 34th Avenue is still operating as an Open Street is because it is popular, and DoT is working on a proposal which should address the obvious issues. And who knows what DoT will propose? Maybe the opponents to OS will get their wish and see the length reduced, hours shortened, etc. I don&#039;t think signs point to that, but maybe!<br /><br />To suggest that no one&nbsp; has said anything to DoT about the obvious issues is pretty out there. DoT even delayed their proposal, I think in part because of the hub-bub that was being created by people lying and claiming there was a plan to eliminate parking on 34th Ave. Even the people who are in favor of OS are asking DoT to make changes that make it accessible, safe, keeps pedestrians and cyclists safer, etc. There&#039;s been a fair amount of community outreach, and really, the way to influence the agency that runs the program is to participate in community feedback to DoT (not this board).<br /><br />How about we give DoT a chance to present its proposal first - which is supposed to happen this fall - which undoubtedly everyone will have a criticism about?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, build more parks and please, please</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />where?

					^curious how you come to this conclusion. There&#039;s a lot I don&#039;t understand, like how frequently are units assessed? (Our property taxes have gone up a lot as property values have increased, so I&#039;m guessing this means it is done frequently). With studios going for $200k+ today, would any JH coop realistically fall under #5?

					I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a question of if it offends, which in and of itself is not an apology, but rather a question of what kind of framing of other people&#039;s perspectives, motivations, and thoughts creates an atmosphere for functional communication and resolution.<br /><br />We all know, or we should know anyway, that when we have a conflict with our SO, the moment one of us starts saying &quot;you always do X&quot; or &quot;you never think about Y&quot; the person saying that is very likely engaging in distorted thinking of has a distorted perception, because almost no one always or never does anything. It also immediately puts our partners in the position of having to defend themselves. The same holds true for community based conversations. If people could just stop painting those who hold a different opinion as the devil incarnate, maybe a productive conversation could happen.<br /><br />And finally, I think a lot of people think of DoT as an agency that can be relied upon to act based on data. Whatever the administration is obviously influences direction. But given who the next mayor likely is, I wouldn&#039;t count on a loss of city support for the OS program.

					^^seems like you&#039;re speaking for all the residents of the avenue when you say what they as a uniform group would welcome.<br /><br />Practically speaking, you have to address how to actually open up and shut down the Open Street 4 times a day. Currently, that is done by volunteers. The logistics of doubling the manpower necessary to do that makes me weary just thinking about. People have to actually manage this stuff, and those people at present are volunteers.<br /><br />Rather than debating online on a forum that holds no sway with our elected representative in the city government or DoT, I think it&#039;s better to participate in the DoT&#039;s forums for the OS. There have been many, many sessions since fall 2020.<br /><br />I&#039;s worth noting that just a few months ago there was a primary for the city council seat opening up. Almost every block on 34th Avenue went for the guy who supports OS. There&#039;s a general election in November. 34th Avenue residents can vote for the Libertarian who wants to end 34th Avenue OS.

					^I&#039;m out on 34th Avenue multiple times a day - morning, afternoon, evenings. I do a little data collection most times I&#039;m out there.&nbsp; I sit down on a particularly shady block, and count the number of people that cross the crosswalk over the course of a minute. The smallest number of people I&#039;ve counted has been 5. The largest was 24. Even on the days when it&#039;s been raining heavily out (looking at you Memorial Day weekend), there were people on the avenue.<br /><br />It&#039;s fine to disagree about what constitutes high or low usage, but it&#039;s disingenuous to say no one is on it most of the time. Foot traffic, just like car traffic ebbs and flows. There&#039;s very little traffic on 35th Avenue right now, but it would be incorrect to say there is no car traffic on it.<br /><br />Also, DoT does seem to be responsive to usage. Sunnyside&#039;s Open Street, which didn&#039;t seem to work, is being turned in to a bike blvd. 34 Avenue OS got planters and a few employees from the city. All signs point to DoT thinking it gets enough foot traffic to warrant further investment, at least for now. It will be interesting to see what they come up with they unveil their plan come fall.

Even during the summer heat waves. 4-8 pm, the street is being used. Usage is lighter mid-day, no doubt. But empty? It wasn&#039;t even empty during the winter.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">35th Ave was flooded on Thursday<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Where was 35th Avenue flooded?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Some people have pointed out that residents of 34th Ave are enjoying the Open Streets and have seen their property values increase because of this program.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And some have argued that property values are down <strong>*because*</strong> of 34th Avenue OS. Until someone produces a report that analyzes closing prices on apartments on 34th Avenue in comparison to real estate values of properties not directly on an OS - which btw is publicly available information, you just need someone with the time awareness of bias to do it - any arguments about property value certainly seem to be cherry picking data that supports the arguers bias.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Many thanks to the volunteers for their efforts, but this needs to be funded and staffed if it&#039;s too be fair to all.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Which is why people should be advocating for DoT to produce its plan for the design of the OS (which was supposed to come in June, but was pushed back in to fall, seemingly thanks in part to the Compromisers working folks up about OS by misrepresenting a proposal by an advocacy group to reduce street parking by 25% across the city as an actual plan by the city to remove parking on 34th Avenue), participating in the visioning sessions and other public forums about 34 OS, and pushing the city to fund the program. Best in my opinion would be a design that doesn&#039;t rely on barricades that must be moved in and out of place twice a day or for drivers to have to move them. Relying on the volunteers is unsustainable in the long run, and its certainly time for the city agency in charge of Open Streets to come up with a solution.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All JH residents opinions count here but those who are profoundly impacted deserve a little more weight with their opinions in my view.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There was a primary election recently for City Council. Most of the candidates came out in favor of 34 Ave OS, but Andy Chen was actively courting the anti-OS/Compromise crowd. Most of the blocks on 34th Avenue went for Shekar Krishnan, who supports turning 34 Ave in to a linear park. Since the city council member for the district has a huge impact on OS, that seems like the time 34th Avenue residents if they dislike OS as much as some people like to insist they do, could have made that clear. There&#039;s a general election coming up soon. Residents of 34th Avenue who dislike OS can vote for the libertarian.
