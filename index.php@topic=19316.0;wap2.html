			I&#039;ve been meaning to post about Bruno&#039;s closure, but just getting to it now. Along with the long-gone Dante&#039;s Catering, Bruno&#039;s was also long-standing in the community. I&#039;m not sure how many years they were in operation, but I know that at a minimum, it dates back to the 1980&#039;s. Kind of sad to see it now gone. I know many people celebrated special occasions there.<br /><br />

			i&#039;d never been there, as i&#039;d been to Dante&#039;s, but it&#039;s always sad to see a longtime business, a unique one, go under.

			I was raised on that side of the neighborhood. My older sister&#039;s wedding reception was at Bruno&#039;s. It was quite a nice place in it&#039;s time. Dante&#039;s was around even longer than Bruno&#039;s and we had nice family events there too.
