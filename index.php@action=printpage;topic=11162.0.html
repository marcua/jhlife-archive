				Have any riders of the F line noticed the Jaguar train?<br /><br />They have not only taken every available ad space in each car of the entire train, but also fully covered the entire exterior of the whole train in advertisements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly it reminds me of the days when subway car graffiti was out of control.<br /><br />Is this a pilot program for future high rollers in advertising? Or maybe this is how the MTA plans to keep the fare down? Honestly it looks awful, not to mention the in your face screaming of it all.

				Noticed a similar immersion on the 7 over the summer. I forget the product, so &#039;ha ha.&#039; incredibly annoying.

				I googled it and found a Vitamin water wrapped S train that had the wrap on the outside, advertisements in the usual places on the inside AND a decal of a Vitamin water on every seat.&nbsp; Even on the ceilings.&nbsp; http://www.railfanwindow.com/gallery2/v/TempByDate/2009-04-06/<br /><br />I read another article that said that Target had generated $250,000 in advertising revenue with only a $42,000 payout.&nbsp; http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/06/mta_wraps_first.php&nbsp; How would they even measure the revenue that came directly from one ad on one train?<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind having one of these cars go by once in a while but it would really get to me if every car starts being like that.

				The Shuttle in Grand Central does it all the time - the whole car is one big ad.&nbsp; One of them was cool though - it looked like you were stepping into a tiki bar - even the seats were decked out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen the 7 train do it - I think it was a hot pink ad on the whole train and it was for T-Mobile maybe?&nbsp; It was annoying but to be honest, I&#039;m more annoyed with inconsiderate riders than ads on the train, lol!

				This seems to be a new form of advertising, not just with Jaguar.&nbsp; We see this and more, from autos, Microsoft, storage companies, to audible book downloads.&nbsp; It&#039;s all over the transit system these days.

				And so every available square inch become a potential money maker in advertising.<br /><br />For awhile even the bars on subway turnstyles were sheathed in ads. That seems to have come to a stop. Does everything need to look like Main Street in Flushing? 74th Street is doing a good job in the Main Street style as well. Before anyone wants to start, my comentary has nothing to do with a dislike of Asians.<br /><br />It&#039;s about being bombarded with rediculous advertising that amounts to nothing more in my estimation than visual pollution.

				It was T-Mobile that bought the 7 last year. It actually looked quite fetching in magenta. :)

				If it means a better MTA train service... more frequent/reliable...due to the influx of cash from advertisers...I say YES!
