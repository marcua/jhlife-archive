								<div class="inner" id="msg_14321">NYC&#039;s leading Spanish daily had a cover story on the workings of Roosevelt Avenue brothels today:<br /><a href="http://www.impre.com/eldiariony/noticias/principal/2009/1/5/red-de-prostitucion-en-queens--101636-1.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.impre.com/eldiariony/noticias/principal/2009/1/5/red-de-prostitucion-en-queens--101636-1.html</a><br />Today&#039;s fun fact: Of the 1,448 prostitution-related arrests made in New York City through May 2008, 18% were in the Roosevelt Ave. area.<br />The reporters gleaned various seedy details on the neighborhood business. The story focuses on a syndicate that controls the area between 76 and 95th streets, with six residential houses owned by a certain Javier Gomez serving as brothels. <br />Most of the prostitutes are from Mexico, and many are here against their will--the story quotes an insider who says that some pimps have the women&#039;s children in Mexico kidnapped in order to force them to stay.<br />Another member of the syndicate, a so-called &quot;FatachÃ©,&quot; is also a police informant, and according El Diario&#039;s source, uses his position to sic the police on rival brothels. The brothel owners also exploit the fact that their houses lie on the border between the 110th and 115th police precincts, and monitor police patrols in order to determine when it&#039;s safe to open.<br />Slowly, under the radar, this situation is growing really ugly.<br /></div>

scream the guys standing on the corners while they distribute cards with erotic images of women.<br /><br />They are the &quot;card distributors&quot;, the men that, mounted on their bikes or by foot, guide the clients toward the clandestine world of the prostitution in Queens.<br /><br />Of a total of 1,448 arrests related to prostitution up until May of 2009 in the City of New York, either by way of patronage, promotion or association, almost 18% occurred in one small zone that borders Roosevelt Avenue, according to the statistics of the State Justice Department. <br />&nbsp;<br />This area, in the North of Queens, includes the communities of Jackson Heights and Corona.&nbsp; In this zone the prostitution has flourished and the arrests have increased 11% last year, according to the Chief of the Anti-Vice Unit of the North of Queens, Joseph Burns.<br /><br />The majority of those involved in this turbulent life of prostitution in this area of Queens -- the owners of the houses that rent spaces without asking questions; the rude men in charge of managing the prostitution houses; and the women that work there, many against their will; and the clients of these prostitutes -- are hispanic.<br /><br />The business is brutal and dangerous, and requires, the clandestine appearance to operate under the noses of the police.&nbsp; And if the bad can infiltrate the legal machinery, that is worth gold to them.<br /><br />This report of EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA opens a window to the life of the prostitution of Roosevelt.&nbsp; Following we will explain how it functions as a ring of six brothels, from how they obtained the houses, to how they hide the gold from the police.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This report is provided from information offered by a participant in the prostitution ring in turn for his/her anonymity.&nbsp; This information has been confirmed and enlarged with political and official figures.&nbsp; It is the result of an investigation that involved multiple reporters during a period of two months. <br /><br />The card distributors stand on Roosevelt and say to all those that pass &quot;Girls, Girls&quot;.&nbsp; Who ever shows interest in the offer is pulled to one of the houses were the women work.<br /><br />The investigation of EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA is central to a ring that controls six houses located between 74th and 95th Streets.&nbsp; The houses are not located directly on Roosevelt Avenue, but are parallel or perpendicular to the Avenue.<br />From outside the houses appear to be simple residential houses, but the reality is that inside they have one room, usually the basement, that serves as the brothel.&nbsp; In each house there are four to six women that work.<br /><br />The prostitutes have to divide the money they earn from their clients with the one in charge of the house.&nbsp; They also have to give a tip to the card distributors, and buy condoms, sanitary paper and additional personal items from the house.&nbsp; The women are the ones that work and the ones that earn the least.<br /><br />The girls earn so little, perhaps some $20 for having sex with the client, in a service that lasts some 15 minutes, according to a source of the Prosecutor&#039;s Office of Queens who did not want to be identified.&nbsp; The service costs $40, but they only receive half; the other half is for the house in which they perform the prostitution.<br /><br />Some of the women are there against their will.&nbsp; In November of 2007, a New York State Law went into effect against the human trafficking of people for being used in sexual work or for being exploited, and enforces the laws that condemn those that use these victims in trafficking.&nbsp; The sentence against those that commit the crime is from 3 to 25 years in prison.<br /><br />Up until July 3 of last year there were 36 victims identified in human trafficking in New York, according to the Division of Criminal Justice Services.&nbsp; A total of 30 of them (women) were born outside of the United States and 19 are from Latin America.<br /><br />According, to our source, two of every 10 women that today work in the ring are victims of human trafficking.<br />The majority of the workers are from Mexico, some are threatened by the pimp, they have&nbsp;them locked up for a year in one apartment, or they take their children hostage to avoid their escape.&nbsp; But the most common is the romantic involvement.<br /><br />The pimp is the one that directly manages the workers and finds the houses where they work.<br /><br />In the ring on Roosevelt there are two women nicknamed Chava and Yesica that are in charge of putting the workers in the houses.&nbsp; EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA contacted three of the workers to confirm the existence of these women.&nbsp; The three workers confirmed the names and their function.<br /><br />In the capsule of the pyramid is the owner of the house and the one that manages the business.<br /><br />According to public documents of the Department of Finance of the City we were able to confirm that three of the houses are owned by Javier Gomez (two located on Forley Street and the other on 76th Street) and that he is the corner of two other house (one on 79th Street and the other on Judge Street).&nbsp; Another house, on Ithaca Street, belongs to his ex-wife.<br /><br />Jorge Cosme, nicknamed &quot;Fatache&quot; and another man, identified only by &quot;Jairo&quot; manage the houses, according to confirmation from two sources that have been inside the business and who have spoken to EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA.&nbsp; Gomez, the owner of the house, apparently rents the basements to &quot;Fatache&quot; and &quot;Jairo&quot; for a determined amount of money (between $1,000 and $3,000), or charging day to day the earnings of the business, according to sources.<br /><br />For the ring, it is essential to hide from the police vigilence.&nbsp; And for that purpose, they try to take advantage of the split in the police coverage.<br /><br />The houses are situated in a zone between two police precincts:&nbsp; 110 and 115.&nbsp; The brothels of the ring have a schedule that depends on the movements of the detectives from the Anti-Vice Unit.&nbsp; According to our sources, the houses operate from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on the wekends the work intensifies.<br /><br />But the secret weapon of the ring, and the important factor is its super subsistance, is that they themselves serve as sources for the authorities.<br /><br />According to our source, &quot;Fatache&quot; has been an informant of prostitution activities for the 110 Precinct for six year or more, to protect his own business.&nbsp; He facilitates data relating to other houses were there is prostitution, to protect his own business.<br /><br />With great detail, our source explained how Fatache and Jairo have mounted, including operations of counterintelligence at the 110 Precinct to know when the undercover agents come out to make their rounds in order to protect those that manage the houses. <br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t think that the police know that Fatache is involved in the business nor do they know that they are being watched at the Precinct. They have a person in front and behind the Precinct informing them of all their activities&quot;, said the source.<br /><br />Neither the 110 Precinct nor the Prosecutor of Queens confirmed that Fatache will function as an informante for the Anti-Vice unit that covered 16 precincts in Queens.&nbsp; The police argued that the identity of the informants that worked for the special units, and that are used with the police to obtain information to conduct arrests, is confidential for their security.<br />&quot;For the protection of Fatache and Jairo they are giving them their houses, Javier feels intochable&quot;, says the source. <br /><br />The Chief of the Anti-Vice Unit and the Prosecutors Office of Queens responded to EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA in not revealing if Gomez, owner of the houses, is under investigation.<br /><br />The prostitution ring revealed by the investigation of EL DIARIO-LA PRENSA is only a small part of the business that flourishes in the shade of the city.&nbsp; To fight it, some experts want to change the traditional focus: that of arresting the prostitutes.<br /><br />Prostitution is a business of alliances, treatment and lies in which at least 30 people take their earnings, but only one does the job.<br /><br />&quot;Prostitution is a crime and all those involved are criminals.&nbsp; You have to change the thought process in prostitution and see the workers as possible victims&quot;, commented Sonio Osorio, President of the Association of New York Women, and one of the leaders in anti-human trafficking in the State of New York.<br /><br />According to the Prosecutor&#039;s Office of Queens, in 2006 there were 541 people processed with charges related to prostitution without counting the prostitutes.<br /><br />Jose Peralta, the Assemblyman of District 39, indicates it is necessary to reinstate what was used to patrol Roosevelt in combating the prostitution and the traffic of drugs in the 80&#039;s and the beginning of the 90&#039;s.<br /><br />At the beginning of last year, Peralta introduced a legislation that could be submitted to a vote this year to increase the charges against the card distributors that promote the prostitution on Roosevelt.<br /><br />The precincts are doing a good job, but there has to be an understanding that Roosevelt is the dividing line between 110 and 115.&nbsp; There has to be more help to fight prostitution.<br />&nbsp; <br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_24181">There&#039;s a story in today&#039;s Daily News about the sex trafficking business that exists behind the closed doors along some of Roosevelt Avenue&#039;s businesses. &nbsp;One victim&#039;s harrowing story is shared.<br /><br /><strong>The New York Daily News</strong><br /><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2009/11/24/2009-11-24_she_survived_the_horror_exchica_takes_aim_at_trafficking.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">She survived the horror Ex-&#039;chica&#039; takes aim at trafficking</a><br />BY Mary Stachyra and Rima Abdelkader<br />Tuesday, November 24th 2009, 10:10 AM<br /><br />AS CHILDREN and their parents walked past crowded restaurants on Roosevelt Ave. in Jackson Heights recently, men yelled &quot;Chicas!&quot; and handed out cards with phone numbers and pictures of busty, scantily clad women.<br /><br />For Kika Cerpa, a woman in her mid-30s, those cards bring back memories of her harrowing ordeal as one of those &quot;chicas.&quot;<br /><br />Cerpa&#039;s hellish tale began in 1993, when she was lured from her native Venezuela by a boyfriend who had moved to the U.S.<br /><br />&quot;I was forced,&quot; Cerpa said of her coercion into prostitution.<br /><br />She escaped that life after a friend was killed by a drunken client, said Cerpa, an alias given to her by an advocacy group that gave her refuge.<br /><br />She lobbied for passage of a state law against human trafficking in 2007. The measure passed. But citywide, there were only eight arrests for sex trafficking in 2008, state records show.<br /><br />And sex trafficking remains all too common along Roosevelt Ave. and in the vicinity, advocates and local leaders said.<br /><br />When Cerpa arrived in the U.S. at age 20, her boyfriend&#039;s cousin - a brothel madame - took her passport and her life savings of almost $2,000 and told her she had to pay off her beau&#039;s debt. She was taken to a brothel on Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br /><em><strong>[Follow above link for complete article]</strong></em></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_24189">Unapologetic liberal here, who thinks both prostitution and marijuana <strong>should</strong> be legalized so they can both be lawfully regulated and taxed. And yes, I <strong>will</strong> employ a double-standard because the types of prostitutes that Elliot Spitzer hired, or the dancers that the wealthy Wall Street types patronize in Manhattan &quot;gentlemen&#039;s clubs&quot; are most likely <strong>not</strong> the victims of human-trafficking and earn more in five minutes than the chicas at Romantico&#039;s earn all night, which hardly makes them victims.<br /><br />As for your insinuations about the police, well... I&#039;m sure from your point of view, <strong>all</strong> police are corrupt. Of course, when <strong>you</strong> need them, they never come quick enough, yet at the same time you don&#039;t want them &quot;oppressing&quot; you with their overbearing presence. You can&#039;t have it <strong>both</strong> ways, so choose a side... either expect the cops to enforce the letter of the law all the time in all jurisdictions, or just admit you&#039;re an anarchist.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_24192">sorry, steve.<br /><br />admittedly,the three times in my life i&#039;ve needed the help of police, i met with utter idiots: a cop responded to a break-in in astoria by completely refusiing to write anything up because &quot;we&#039;ll never find these guys,&quot; a pickpocketing on the subway was met with &quot;well, he&#039;s long gone now&quot; and a car set on fire in my old JH driveway (fire response was A-plus) was met by cops telling me this was &quot;a job for sanitation, not a crime.&quot;<br /><br />but that doesn&#039;t mean all cops are corrupt. the thing that leads me to believe that *many* in these precincts are corrupt starts with what leoooog says above. there are guys on every corner openly offering sex for sale. there are guys every three or so blocks selling &quot;social, social, papers, papers&quot; and there are cops standing within earshot. either we have an unusual number of deaf patrolmen in jackson heights, or the bonus money offered by the thugs is better than my tax money.</div>
