We&#039;ll tend our curbside tree gardens along 37th Ave. and weed our spectacular new garden at the Post Office. <br />What you haven&#039;t joined us yet!?!?! Saturday is your chance.<br />BTW, our wonderful volunteers have been enlisting the help of merchants to maintain the curbside tree gardens. Look for the new signs and let the merchants know you appreciate their effort. <br />And check out our new poster (Collectors Edition!!!) that&#039;s attached.</span></span><br /><br />Tree LC is one of two JHBG neighborhood greening programs. Why two? Weâ€™ve got a lot to green.

				I want to commend you guys for the great work you are doing.&nbsp; I have once question though.&nbsp; It seems many of the plants used don&#039;t have fragrances, as many of the plants in the apartment gardens (especially the roses).&nbsp; Is there a reason for this.&nbsp; It would be nice to see a mock orange bush around.&nbsp; <br />Also what happened to the beautiful thistle that was part of the post office garden?

				Happy you are enjoying the Post Office garden and thank you for noticing. <br />There were many plants we would have loved to use, but in working with a volunteer NYC parks landscape architect and neighbor, we focused on several strategies:<br />* plants that will provide close to four seasons interest, as well as a variety of colors and shapes.<br />* Shrubs and long-lived perennials so we don&#039;t need to replant every year, including natives and drought-tolerant species to the extent possible. <br />* Plants that will attract beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, especially butterfly weed and milkweed, the only plant that monarch butterflies lay their eggs on.<br />As for fragrance, we have Russian sage in there which has an amazing scent.<br />We will be doing some fine-tuning; for instance, the nursery will replace 20 Black-eyed Susan plants because they are not the variety we ordered. They have tiny flowers and are way to big for the front of the garden, blocking the view of other plants.<br />
