					The arched entrance to the upper floor of English Gables will be restored by the building owner.&nbsp; I was at the Community Board Landmarks meeting when a representative of the owner came with his proposal.&nbsp; It was certainly welcomed by those in attendance, and will be by the public at large when the work is completed.&nbsp; I believe the medical facility that vacated 82-11 37 Avenue will be located on the second floor of this building.

					Thanks to the efforts of Jim Riccio (and his team) of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, much of the graffiti was removed this weekend from 79, 80 and 81 Streets.&nbsp; So there is some good news to report.

					There seems to be a least one deli-grocery per block now.&nbsp; And even though this store has the landmarks approved storefront, the show window became crowded with signs and clutter in a matter of weeks.&nbsp; I spoke with him when he first opened, suggesting that he differentiate himself from all of the other deli-groceries, especially the one directly across the street that is reminiscent of the South Bronx in the 1970s.&nbsp; Little seems to change.<br /><br />Seemingly no research into what the neighborhood needs. Just more of the same - banks, eyebrow-threading, low-end clothes, deli groceries, drug stores.&nbsp; I will say it again.&nbsp; Our commercial property owners and merchants have zero vision and zero sense of merchandising.&nbsp; At least on 82nd Street the addition of some restored storefronts is making a difference.&nbsp; But now we have the THIRD fruit and vegetable vendor on 82nd and 37th.... one step forward, another one back or so it seems.

					Thank you lalochezia.&nbsp; I have thought about these points many times.<br /><br />My conclusion is that (the majority of) both our commercial property owners and current batch of merchants have no vision whatsoever.&nbsp; If one more deli-grocery with LED chaser lights opens - there must be about one per block in some stretches along 37th Avenue - I think I&#039;ll go crazy.&nbsp; At least it is not a bank, drug store or low-end clothing shop.&nbsp; Seemingly, the property owners don&#039;t really care that much about the quality of their merchants. As long as they agree to the rent, so be it.&nbsp; And we now have new merchants in the Historic District who have installed landmarks-approved storefronts and signs, and yet plaster more signs below their show window, in the window, hang illegal LED chaser lights in the show window, and (in my view) probably repel more customers than they attract.&nbsp; No sense of merchandising, but that is not just Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Again, merchants with no vision, no market research on the neighborhood... thereby missing out on those people who can afford to shop in Manhattan, online, or take their car to another neighborhood or shopping district.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately it is up to risk-taking merchants to open establishments that will appeal to all segments of the Jackson Heights community.&nbsp; I have told many people, that if you want to open a successful business in Jackson Heights, open a non-ethnic, not-diner restaurant that simply caters to people who want to sit down and have a pleasant meal in a tasteful environment.&nbsp; That will succeed.&nbsp; And this comes from the grandson of luncheonette owners (on both sides of the family) in Manhattan back in the &#039;30s and &#039;40s.&nbsp; The next generations chose to exit the food business.... obviously.<br /><br />Here&#039;s to hoping there are risk-taking merchants who will find us.........eventually.....

					Since it is a temporary sign (or it should be, at least, but who knows), the Landmarks Preservation Commission will probably not be the best route.&nbsp; I would suggest we all contact the real estate firm to express our dismay at seeing this thing draped across the façade of the building.&nbsp; The more, the merrier.

					In 2008 the Jackson Heights Beautification Group sent in a Request for Evaluation to landmark the La Mesa Verde Apartment on 90th &amp; 91st Streets, between 35th and 34th Avenues.&nbsp; (See below) The request was rejected.&nbsp; In 2008 the trees in the garden were cut down and an application to turn the garden into a parking lot was submitted.&nbsp; In March, residents (it is a rent-regulated building) were sent a &quot;Notice of Commencement of Proceeding Upon Owner&#039;s Application for Permission to Change or Decrease Dwelling Space, Etc.&quot; to proceed with turning the garden into a parking lot.&nbsp; The tenants have until about April 15th to vote for or against this, but the complete process to a parking lot is not known.&nbsp; &nbsp;Curb cuts and a driveway had existed for years, but now the plans are for a parking lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />This building should have been landmarked.&nbsp; Smiths &quot;Cherokee Flats&quot; (loving written about in the 2/2/14 NY Times Streetscapes column) in Manhattan are, of course, landmarked.&nbsp; Please contact Councilmember Julissa Ferraras at 718 651 1917, and let her know that a landmark-worthy garden apartment complex should not have its garden turned into a parking lot.&nbsp; Although not in his district, you can call Councilmember Daniel Dromm&#039;s office at 718 803 6373.&nbsp; Both share parts of our existing Jackson Heights Historic District.<br /><br />The application was made through the State of New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal Office of Rent Administration at Gertz Plaza 92-31 Union Hall St&nbsp; Jamaica, NY&nbsp; 11433&nbsp; 718 739 6400&nbsp; &nbsp; Docket # CN 110002 OD.&nbsp; Address given as 34-46 91 Street<br /><br />The La Mesa Verde Apartments were built by the Open Stairs Dwelling Company (OSDC) and designed by Henry Atterbury Smith.&nbsp; The OSDC acquired the land from the Queensboro Corporation, the developer of Jackson Heights, and completed the La Mesa Verde Apartments in 1926, making them contemporary with the already designated Jackson Heights Historic District.&nbsp; Smith also designed (the already designated) East River Homes (also known as the Shively Sanitary Apartments and the Cherokee Flats) in 1912.&nbsp; The La Mesa Verde Apartments are similar in concept to the East River Homes.<br />The complex is made up of six detached buildings, connected by sky-bridges, located between 90th and 91st Streets, between 35th and 34th Avenues.&nbsp; The buildings are set at an angle to the street grid, and form a saw-tooth pattern down both blocks.&nbsp; They enclose a large internal garden courtyard, similar to the garden apartments built by the Queensboro Corporation.&nbsp; There are no interior hallways at the La Mesa Verde; all apartments are reached directly from the open stairs.&nbsp; There is only one elevator for these six-story buildings.&nbsp; Tenants on higher floors ride the elevator up to the roof, then walk across the sky-bridges to their buildings, and then walk down the stairs to their apartment.<br />At the La Mesa Verde Smith was influenced any ancient pueblo architecture of the American Southwest.&nbsp; Pueblo buildings of similar height, with their flat roofs and ladder-like stairs were his primary inspiration.&nbsp; There were practical advantages to this: “Think of having your own cottage outside door, although living on the fifth or sixth floor.&nbsp; Open stairs make possible elevator apartments with no smells from the basement and absolutely no stair odors from other people’s apartments.” (quote from Queensboro Magazine)<br />Here are some comments about the importance of these buildings from Columbia Professor Richard Plunz:<br />In the 1920s the work of Henry Atterbury Smith, who had pioneered an earlier generation of philanthropic housing including the open stair tenement, paralleled (Andrew) Thomas’ and (Henry) Wright’s housing research.&nbsp; His work was far more exploratory, however.&nbsp; In 1917 Smith set a precedent with the first theoretical work proposing that building geometry could deviate from the geometry of the New York gridiron.&nbsp; He suggested that buildings did not have to be oriented along lot lines and argued that other geometries, based on purely functional considerations such as light and view, might be superimposed on the gridiron.&nbsp; (page 174)<br />Smith’s Mesa Verde housing was more radical.&nbsp; The project, which was completed in 1926, assimilated many of his ideas of the previous decade.&nbsp; (page 176)<br />By 1926 the Mesa Verde was as radical an alternative to traditional housing as anything realized in the Netherlands and Germany&nbsp; (page 180)<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History of Housing in New York City,&nbsp; &nbsp;Richard Plunz, page 174-180 (that includes original photos of the La Mesa Verde Apartments)<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson Heights – A Garden in the City,&nbsp;

					Storefront restorations that follow the rules established by the Landmarks Preservation Commission (and NOT requiring a public hearing if you follow them) always look great.&nbsp; I just hope that the owner does not crowd his lovely windows with advertising and products as many other deli-groceries do.&nbsp; Unfortunately Jimmy&#039;s, one block away now has ads glued to the bulkhead and next to the door along with other items in front.&nbsp; Here was a landmark-approved storefront that is now edging toward looking like Q&amp;Q market.&nbsp; Q&amp;Q market, on the southeast corner of 80th Street and 37th Avenue has windows, but you cannot see through them.&nbsp; I hope this new merchant reads this blog, and understands that mercha<span class="bbc_u"></span>ndising and making his new storefront attractive will increase business, whereas, ads (where the soda, cigarette, you name it, company must pay the merchant something to put them on the storefront and on the windows) and other detritus, repel shoppers from entering their stores.&nbsp; Our merchants need to aim higher.&nbsp; I am hoping this merchant does.&nbsp; I would like to patronize his business...

					Good news to report.&nbsp; Both the Landmarks Preservation Commission and Councilmember Dromm&#039;s office were responsive to being contacted about this building by the Jackson Heights Beautification Group.&nbsp; The LPC did come to see what was (and was not) being done, and contacted the owner (A&amp;E) directly.&nbsp; Sharon Stanley at Councilmember Dromm&#039;s office was wonderful in following up and calling the property owner.&nbsp; She spoke with a representative of the owners who promised that all permits - including those from Landmarks - will be obtained before work is done.&nbsp; This is in marked&nbsp; contrast to the damage that was done to Cedar Court (at the southern end of the very same block) about seven years ago.&nbsp; We wanted to prevent this from happening again... since some time large property owners often forget that Landmarks permits are required in historic districts.<br /><br />Please keep an eye on this building... and any others where you see work being done.&nbsp; By the way, about ten residential apartment buildings in Jackson Heights were sold by Vantage and its partners to A&amp;E this past December.&nbsp; The two buildings that comprise Ivy Court (designed as a smaller garden apartment complex by Andrew J. Thomas in 1923) were sold for almost $14 million in December.

					Since this is a building that contributes to our Historic District I have contacted the enforcement department of Landmarks and City Councilman Danny Dromm.&nbsp; The JHBG will be meeting with Councilmember Dromm tomorrow and we will bring up this matter.&nbsp; There are new owners of this building, and they have been contacted as well - to let them know that the community is watching what they are doing.&nbsp; It was previously owned by Vantage Properties that installed a fence and some windows without Landmarks approval.<br /><br />No one will spend the money to install a sidewalk shed just for the heck of it.&nbsp; It is typically a precursor for masonry work - which REQUIRES landmarks approval.&nbsp; Let&#039;s make sure the work is done properly. So keep an eye out.&nbsp; Other property owners in the Historic District need permits, so should the owners who paid over $13 million for Ivy Court.

					The building in question is Ivy Court (83-84 Streets, south side of 34 Avenue), designed by Andrew J. Thomas and a contributing building to our historic district.&nbsp; The building Francis mentioned, is another Thomas-designed building at the other end of the same block, that has outstanding violations because the property owner ignored the fact that it needed Landmarks permits.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have contacted the enforcement department at Landmarks to see if there are any LPC permits for Ivy Court.&nbsp; The address is somewhere between 34-01 and 34-09 83 Street, an 34-02 to 34-10 84 Street.&nbsp; I saw the sidewalk shed this weekend, so thanks for reminding me to contact the LPC.

					I have issued my 4Q2013 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report (sorry for the delay, the city was tardy in updating the public record) which highlights a very good year for sales and a positive upward trend, especially for apartments.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy by subscribing on <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br /><br />Here is a brief synopsis:<br /><br />2013 was certainly the “turnaround” year, when both sales volumes and average sales prices increased.&nbsp; Sales of houses in the 11372 zip code, while essentially flat to 2012, experienced much higher average sales prices across the board when compared with 2012.&nbsp; Apartment sales rose dramatically, to 429, up 50% from 2012.&nbsp; The trend increased quarter by quarter, and fourth quarter 2013 sales were the highest in over seven years.&nbsp; While the number of sales rose dramatically, average sales price increases were more moderate, rising by no more than 11% in any category.&nbsp; Demand for larger apartments drove prices past pre-financial crisis peaks.&nbsp; For the first time ever, six-room units at Hawthorne Court passed the $700,000 mark.&nbsp; Seven room units at The Towers and The Chateau, in less renovated condition, sold for just under the $700,000 level.&nbsp; <br /><br />As prices rose elsewhere – especially Manhattan and “brownstone” Brooklyn - Jackson Heights, especially its historic district, also benefited.&nbsp; Interestingly, buyers of both houses and large apartments have come from not only outside the neighborhood, but from existing residents as well.&nbsp; This bodes well for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.&nbsp; No one knows the neighborhood like I do!<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />
