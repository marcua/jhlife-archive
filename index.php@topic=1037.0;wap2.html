			Outside of grabbing a wrap and sitting on the bench at Espresso 77, is there anywhere close by that we can take our dog with us to sit outside while we enjoy a casual, but flavorful dinner? I know of a few places in Manhattan that allow it, but nothing in Queens.<br /><br />http://www.dogfriendly.com/server/travel/uscities/guides/us/cities/usonlinecityNYNew_York.shtml<br /><br />Does anyone have a suggestion?

			Cafe 89, which is a coffee shop kinda place but nice and clean, has those two tables outside where dogs can sit with you. (I think it&#039;s too noisy.)It&#039;s on Northern at 89th though.&nbsp; Is that too far?&nbsp;

			ONLY on weekdays on 30th Avenue in Astoria . . . all the outdoor cafes let you sit there with your dog(s) as long as you are by the outside of the tables (nearest the sidewalk)&nbsp; and the dog(s) are well behaved. A couple of them will even give you a soup bowl of cold water under your table. This is one of my very special personal treats. I will go shopping early in the morning, go home and unpack everything, grab the dogs and head over to Athens for an iced coffee. Sure, I can make it at home, or find it less expensively elsewhere, but every now and then I get to see folks passing by that I haven&#039;t seen for ages, and by the time I leave, it&#039;s usually a table for 10 instead of 1 and the pups are chowing down on something yummy that some other diner can&#039;t finish! Oh! Yes. One other thing . . . i only do it when the ambient outdoor temperature is between 65â€“85 degrees.

			Spanish, I know u go to the city with dog.&nbsp; My friend owns Sullivan Street Cafe on Sullivan just north of Houston.&nbsp; They have outside tables and are very dog friendly.&nbsp; This is one of the few places I don&#039;t mind sitting on the street&nbsp; because it&#039;s a quiet, pretty block.&nbsp; I thought most places with outdoor seating would let a dog come but I was wrong.&nbsp; Some places don&#039;t want dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was hoping Gianni&#039;s pizzaria would let dogs in the back yard seating area.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Maybe because you have to bring the dog thru the business, who knows.<br /><br /><br />

			Cafe 89 is definitely too noisy. We avoid Northern Blvd like the plague. I heard the city is really cracking down on pets in restaurants and stores lately for some reason. It&#039;s weird because the dogs are usually cleaner than most of the wait-staff at these places. I wish there were more bench seating on 37th Avenue, like in front of Yogurtberry, many of the Argentine restaurants, Starbucks, etc. People should take a cue from Espresso 77 and not wait for the city or a BID to provide them. They should take a chance and do it themselves. It&#039;s bound to increase business, and then I&#039;ll have more places to sit with my dog and my smoothy!
