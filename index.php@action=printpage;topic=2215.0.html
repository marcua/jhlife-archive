				So, February&#039;s Food Group....<br /><br />I&#039;m open minded. I had in mind a few places... all south american<br />Argentine - La Fusta o&nbsp; La Portena<br />Peruvian* - Punto Fijo Restaurant - 8912 Northern Boulevard<br />Colombian - Casa Columbia - 8623 Roosevelt Avenue -- this would be a real interesting adventure...

				Casa Columbia sounds intriguing.&nbsp; Sunday is &quot;lazy day&quot; in my household so any Sunday and any time of the day works.&nbsp; <br />So what&#039;s with the asterisk next to Punto Fijo- is it to:<br />1) note how much farther away it is?- two subway stops and a walk to Northern (!)<br />2) convey a subliminal message for us to pick that one?<br />3) force people to ask you what it&#039;s about?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)

				as for punto fijo: Well, it might be a little far for february. that&#039;s true. <br />There is another that I was iniitally interested in - but that was on Junction.... so even worse. BUT - it is the Jackson Heights food group. so people in principle might live anywhere in the neighborhood if they are from the neighborhood. It would be a hike for me. any other suggestions along these lines?

				I could go for any of these but I have to admit I&#039;m interested in La Fusta... I know its heavy on the red meat, but I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a lot to choose from on the menu. La Portena was ok, been twice, not blown away... a decent steak but disappointing sides and rather pricy. La Fusta is probably same $wise. I loved Delhi Heights by the way!

				I can also make it any Sunday except the 15th of February which is the Sunday of President&#039;s weekend.&nbsp; I would love to go to La Fusta since I haven&#039;t been there but the other options also work for me.

				I&#039;d like to add another peruvian to the mix: <br />El Anzuelo Fino<br />86-01 Northern Boulevard, Jackson Heights NY 11372<br /><br />which is supposed to have outstanding ceviche amongst other things.

				Ok, my brother wimped out for monster trucks sunday, so instead I took a tour of the neighborhood - stepping inside some possibilities for this month. So, my impressions:<br /><br />All of those I mentioned would be great places to go with a date or good friends. <br /><br />The Peruvian places stood out the most for me. They specialize in seafood, especially ceviche. plus they have roast chicken and plenty of other specialities. Plus, pretty reasonable pricing!<br />Between Anzuello Fino and Punta Fija... I would say Anquello. It&#039;s a little closer to the heart of the heights (but does that really matter for the sake of food?), it&#039;s brighter, and it seems a bit more respectable - plus a bigger menu. I found this place because I met some peruvians in terrazza cafe and they raved about it. I would liken this to our experience at hornado ecuatoriano - but with less of a depressing atmosphere (those neon lights). <br /><br />http://www.eatingintranslation.com/2009/01/el-anzuelo-fino.html<br />http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/07/el-anzuelo-fino-peruvian-ceviche-woodhaven-jackson-heights-queens-nyc.html<br /><br />Casa Colombia seemed like a good experience of food. The prices are higher than the peruvians, but you are pretty much guaranteed to be stuffed by the end. They have a good amount of space, but I think mostly booths. I believe they are open 24 hours. Pretty respectable for colombian food - I&#039;ll say that. <br /><br />La Fusta - definitely has some character. It&#039;s like an old NY steakhouse. would be about 30pp. I was interested in this originally because I thought they served all grass fed beef - but that&#039;s not true, only one steak is grass fed. - This got me interested in the butchers on 37th.... another thread... BUT, I like how it&#039;s old men working in the kitchen. seems like they know what they are doing and are serious about it. Again, great place to go with someone special. <br /><br />And, when the weather gets warmer, we HAVE to go into Corona. Corona is awesome. lots of fun and totally another world. <br /><br />so, that&#039;s my research... thoughts?

				Justin and I have been to both steakhouses several times, so our preference is to try any of the others.&nbsp; If we end up doing Peruvian, I have a coworker who I can get recommendations from on typical dishes.&nbsp; <br />

				Casa Columbia<br />8623 Roosevelt Ave<br />5.25 pm - to try and beat the crowds. If there are any.... This place is open 24-hours a day. While I&#039;d love to do a 1am, I might be eating alone in this case... <br /><br />Here are some articles:<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/lifestyle/1996/08/21/1996-08-21_queens__district_of_colombia.html<br /><br />http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7411729/flushing_ny/casa_columbia.html<br /><br />Plus, a good resource is the thread on here:<br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1058.0<br />http://www.weareneverfull.com/cositas-ricas-a-colombian-food-primer-a-podcast/<br />-- this podcast isn&#039;t bad. I listened to it this morning. Doesn&#039;t shed a ton of light on the cuisine, but it gets you in the colombian mode - thats for sure. <br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_cuisine<br />http://colombia-travel.suite101.com/article.cfm/colombian_food_and_drink<br /><br />&nbsp;:smitten:<br /><br />As for the afterparty, for those who are game, we could go to Terraza Cafe/Bar<br />http://www.terrazacafe.com<br /><br />It&#039;s a secret and it&#039;s basically the coolest bar ever. <br /><br />SO there you have it.... Sunday, 5.25pm Casa Colombia. Sunday in Little Bogata.<br />

				We had 5 people at this one with one new person from yelp included. We spent a long time there, talking as usual. I liked the food, but the best part was the people. Glad to get judibean and her bo out on roosevelt ave for the latino experience of the hood. <br />There was a language barrier, yes, but they seemed eager to communicate and everyone had smiles on their faces. lots of cute families and couples dining out. good atmosphere. I&#039;m happy to be living in this neighborhood.
