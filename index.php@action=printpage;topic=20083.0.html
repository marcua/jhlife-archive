				Just a heads up, check how much you&#039;re being charged for things if you shop at Maynard Farms (the fruit vendor with apples, cider, berries, etc.) at the Greenmarket. I was charged $2.50/lb for something that was $2/lb and paid about $2 more than I should have. I asked the vendor about it and he said the price was $2.50 despite the sign saying $2. <br /><br />I know farmers are struggling but they&#039;ve gotta charge the posted prices. I&#039;m fortunate that $2 isn&#039;t a huge deal to me, but maybe it is to others, like the people in line ahead of me who were paying with Snap vouchers. I would have been totally fine paying $2.50/lb but the person was so rude about it and was implying that I lied about the sign (I went back and checked! I was right!) that I&#039;ll never shop there again. Too bad, because I&#039;m gonna need to find another vendor that sells apples year round!<br />
