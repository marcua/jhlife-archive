					<em>A message from Assembly Member Den Dekker</em><br /><br />Here&#039;s a rundown of some of the things my office and I did today:<br /><br />Today was a very sad day for our community. 13 people died within 24 hours at Elmhurst Hospital due to complications from COVID-19. The New York Times published a report alerting the public to conditions inside the hospital. In response, I joined with Assembly Member Catalina Cruz NY and Assembly Member Jeffrion Aubry to reach out directly to the Governor’s Office to address this urgent issue. After that discussion, the New York City Mayor&#039;s Office and NYC Health + Hospitals President/CEO Dr. Mitchell Katz held a conference call with the entire Queens Assembly delegation so that we could voice our concerns. The City added additional medical personnel and sent additional supplies -- including 40 ventilators -- to Elmhurst Hospital, and transferred some non-critical patients to other facilities to remedy the immediate situation. The State has also offered additional resources if needed. We are closely monitoring the situation and hope that those who are ill make a full recovery.<br /><br />I have also been discussing potential locations to set up more hospital beds in our area to handle the surge of patients. I have spoken with Assembly Member Aubry about using the former locations of Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica and Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills; both buildings are currently vacant. I also explored the possibility of using the old Sports Authority building on Northern Boulevard in Woodside with Assembly Member Brian Barnwell.<br /><br />I am also concerned about the COVID-19 outbreak that is currently happening on Rikers Island. I am happy that Mayor de Blasio is attempting to address this issue by releasing non-violent incarcerated persons and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid infecting them with COVID-19. I am fearful, however, that Corrections Officers and other Department of Corrections personnel, incarcerated people, and visitors could potentially still contract COVID-19 at Rikers Island. I wrote a letter to Mayor de Blasio urging him to immediately set up testing facilities at Rikers Island so that we can test as many people as possible so we can halt the spread of Coronavirus on Rikers Island.<br /><br />I took part in a separate conference call with the Queens Assembly delegation about the state budget. I also had conversations with some of my other colleagues regarding the budget, including Assembly Speaker Heastie; the deadline to pass the budget is April 1st.<br /><br />I am proud to announce that I have co-sponsored Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou&#039;s bill, A10224, that would suspend rent collection so that we can provide relief to individuals who lost their incomes as a result of all non-essential businesses being shuttered.<br /><br />Finally, my office has been fielding calls all day and assisting constituents with SCRIE, DRIE, unemployment claims, and information on small business assistance. If you have any questions, thoughts, or concerns, feel free to call my office at (718) 457-0384, email at <a href="mailto:dendekkerm@nyassembly.gov" class="bbc_email">dendekkerm@nyassembly.gov</a>, or Facebook Message us.A me<br /><br />

The locations have yet to be determined.<br /><br />“We must protect bicycles from reckless drivers,” said Assembly Member Michael DenDekker (D-Jackson Heights), the bill’s author.<br /><br />DenDekker drafted the measure after Woodside cyclists complained of cars and trucks clogging the Queens Boulevard bike lane, according to a statement.<br /><br />Mayor de Blasio has shown strong support for the lanes throughout his tenure, and the Department of Transportation has added more than 83 miles to the system under his watch, according to 2018 figures provided by the agency’s commissioner, Polly Trottenberg.<br /><br />But only a fraction of those paths have physical barriers separating cyclists from drivers, and de Blasio earlier this year balked at the cost of using dedicated NYPD teams to patrol the lanes.<br /><br />Cops themselves are routine violators of bike-lane parking laws, critics charge. At least one Twitter account, @CopsinBikeLanes, has dedicated itself to calling out officers, in New York and elsewhere, for the practice.<br /><br />DenDekker praised the DOT’s commitment to building the lanes, but he says more must be done to protect the riders who use them.<br /><br />“We must ensure that enforcement of traffic laws keeps cars and trucks out of those bicycle lanes and allows bicyclists to travel in bicycle lanes safely,” he said.<br /><br />DenDekker introduced the bill, A06674, in March. It currently sits before the Assembly Transportation Committee.<br /><br /><a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/bill-calls-for-cameras-to-go-up-to-ticket-drivers-in-bike-lanes" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/bill-calls-for-cameras-to-go-up-to-ticket-drivers-in-bike-lanes</a>

					Please check into your candidates very well. We have many &quot;new&quot; candidates that have been trained and are endebted to Hiram Monserrate. Yes, he is running for District Leader in his area and his followers are running in our areas. Speaking for myself I do NOT want his influence taking over. I ask that you each research all the candidates. That would include their Facebbok accounts, Twitter accounts and anything else you can find. <br /><br />I know that in my area - (34th - part A) - the new candidate is a Monserrate follower and has done nothing to work for this neighborhood. I will never vote for her.&nbsp; I believe that Hiram has people running for District leader in many areas so that he can he elected County Leader. Is that what you want - Hiram taking over the machine?<img src="https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /> NO!!!&nbsp; NEVER!!!<br /><br />I will vote for Maureen Allen - the incubent. She has worked hard for all of JH for many years. Yes, she&nbsp; can be called a mamber of the establishment. However, she is a proven die-hard Jackson Heighter. She is also President of the JH Kiwanis Club and they have sponsered many events here. Remember the big street fair along 37th Avenue? Maureen has always been incharge of it. She is responsive to the residents and the merchants in Jackson Heights through her associations. She is the person to help keep JH beautiful, functioning and the place we love.<br /><br />Please research them both. Do you want Hiram invovled in Jackson Heights? Do you want Hiram to take over the County party?? I say NO!!!&nbsp; NEVER!!!!<br /><br />NO for Monserrate and his followers!<br /><br />VOTE FOR MAUREEN ALLEN !!!!
