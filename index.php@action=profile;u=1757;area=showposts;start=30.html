					You know what - my husband is a person of color who&#039;s been stopped and frisked his whole adult life, and he would gladly sit in a checkpoint for this purpose because it is worth it. Jackson Heights has the highest number of drunk drivers in the entire city, and we have a depressingly high number of pedestrian injuries and fatalities.&nbsp; I am very good friends with a undocumented person from Ecuador, who delivers pizza. He was hit by a unlicensed drunk driver right here in JH, and was not able to work for several weeks and now suffers from disabling back pain.&nbsp; My husband and I tried to help him as much as we could, but he will never be the same.<br /><br /><a href="http://nypost.com/2010/06/14/nycs-drunkest/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nypost.com/2010/06/14/nycs-drunkest/</a><br /><br />

					The answer is no, I have not called 911 on any picnicking couples, nor have I called 911 on toking teenagers near a children&#039;s playground, because I haven&#039;t observed any in that setting. It is however a legally mandated right to do so, and judgment call is most likely based on context, such as proximity to 3 year olds on a teeter totter might be alarming to some. However the picnicking couple are liable to receive a $25 fine for their misdemeanor offense, from a cop strolling through the park. <br /><br />You can make a pubic drinking complaint under these circumstances:<br /><br /><a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1554/drinking-complaint" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1554/drinking-complaint</a><br /><br />Public drinking outdoors is a 311, not a 911 complaint.<br /><br /><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/apps/311universalintake/form.htm?serviceName=NYPD+Drinking+in+Public" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/apps/311universalintake/form.htm?serviceName=NYPD+Drinking+in+Public</a><br /><br />Call 911 to report:<br /><br />Underage drinking of alcohol outside or in a parked vehicle<br /><br />Drinking alcohol in an unlicensed establishment, social club, or bodega<br />

					<br />&quot;there seems something just a bit hypocritical (to me anyway) about saying you&#039;re for legalization on one hand and then calling 911 -- and potentially subjecting the offenders to a possible prison sentence -- the minute you smell something funky. what do you think will happen if you get your wish and legalization actually happens?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Actually it&#039;s not hypocritical at all. Legalization does not necessarily mean public smoking of a controlled substance would be legal also. Legalization would probably mean that it would be acceptable to smoke in your own house, although probably not in your co-op, which are multiple dwellings. Alcohol is a legal substance, public drinking in parks is nota legal activity, except under certain, defined circumstances.

					I appreciate the effort to make NYC more ecological re transportation. However I must admit I hate the bike lanes because they make driving much more challenging, especially because so many bicyclists zoom up on you when you&#039;re in the midst of making a turn. I guess it&#039;s better than having people ride on the sidewalk.

					I am in favor of legalization of medical marijuana, and perhaps even for recreational purposes in private settings. , I But I think that smoking marijuana in a public park, and certainly to the degree that it is wafting into the children&#039;s playground sounds like trouble.

					I said drug use. If you saw people shooting up or smoking cocaine, you might consider it an emergency. Or if you suspected people were selling drugs, I think 911 would be appropriate. I disagree with comparing it to littering, it&#039;s really the context that determines whether to call 311 or 911.&nbsp; And people smoking pot in a public park may be engaging in other forms of illegal behavior, which would suggest the use of 911 to alert the police in a timely manner. <br /><br />In any event, this is the official policy on the reporting of public drug use:<br /><br /><a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/467/how-do-i-report-someone-using-or-selling-illegal-drugs" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/467/how-do-i-report-someone-using-or-selling-illegal-drugs</a><br />

Jose Peralta, who represents Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights, said at a press conference where he discussed an initiative to provide foreign-born victims of sex trafficking with free legal representation on immigration issues.<br /><br />“Roosevelt Avenue is a mecca of human trafficking in Queens and throughout the five boroughs,” Peralta said.<br /><br /><br /><br />There are gangs “that are participating in bringing women from all over the world,&quot; he later told DNAinfo New York.<br /><br />“They bring them right to Roosevelt Avenue,” the state senator said. “It’s really a hub and epicenter of human trafficking.”<br /><br />RELATED COVERAGE:<br /><br />►Prostitution ring dismantled days before Super Bowl<br /><br />►Sex ring that serviced wealthy clients in four brothels busted<br /><br />Kika Cerpa, who was a victim of sex trafficking, said at the conference that she came to New York from Venezuela, following her boyfriend, when she was 17.<br /><br />Her boyfriend&#039;s family was involved in the sex trafficking business and took away her passport, telling her she owed them a lot of money.<br /><br />“They told me that the only way I could pay it all was by working in a brothel on Roosevelt Avenue,” she said.<br /><br />Cerpa, who was on the verge of tears as she read a statement, said she was trafficked for the next three years and “moved from one brothel to another.&quot; During that time, she said she was arrested several times for prostitution and treated like a criminal, not a victim.<br /><br />That situation changed for many women who are victims of sex trafficking when the Queens Human Trafficking Intervention Court was created last year, she said. The initiative assists people arrested on prostitution charges by treating them as survivors who need support. <br /><br />The city&#039;s Family Justice Centers also provide help to victims of sex trafficking and domestic violence with counseling, shelter and legal assistance. The first of four such centers opened in Brooklyn in 2005. The center in Queens opened in Kew Gardens in 2008.<br /><br />According to statistics provided by the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence, more than 120 sex trafficking victims have sought services at the these centers since 2005. Some 56 percent of those victims asked for help at the Queens Family Justice Center.<br /><br />Several pro bono immigration attorneys will be available at the Queens center through the initiative unveiled Thursday, which is a collaboration between the Mayor&#039;s Office to Combat Domestic Violence, Sanctuary for Families and the Queens Human Trafficking Intervention Court.<br /><br />The initiative will &quot;connect survivors of trafficking in the borough of Queens to specialized pro bono immigration services provided by some of New York City’s top lawyers,&quot; said Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, commissioner of the Mayor’s Office to Combat Domestic Violence.<br /><br />The lawyers can help eligible victims to apply for T visas, which allow some victims of human trafficking to temporarily remain in the U.S. and work, Pierre-Louis said.<br /><br />Victims can also get guidance on applying to have criminal convictions related to trafficking vacated.<br />

(Basically we and LIC got Times Square after Guiliani and the developers shut the in-your-face sex trade down.) Now that LIC is desirable all those strip clubs etc. are getting pushed out. For a long time the middle class population of JH didn&#039;t have enough clout to really effect fabric of life changes here, now that there&#039;s money being pushed into JH, things will gradually change. Unfortunately JH is maddening and mind-boggling slow to deal with fabric of life issues, so even with the money, it will still take some time. JH residents aren&#039;t asking for much, just not to have to run the gauntlet of sex clubs etc and pick up chica chica cards off their front stoop in the morning. I live in a the historic district and in the morning I often see used condoms in the gutter because the prostitutes drive over with their johns to a quiet spot on a&nbsp; side street to be intimate. Just my take on it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					But I mean no disrespect to the male opinions. I just don&#039;t think they can give informed opinions over control over women&#039;s bodies and our autonomy of livelihood, at least not to the degree that a woman can. But that&#039;s what a message board is, many different takes.

					I don&#039;t think anyone expects definitive answer. But my point is that having men speak for us negates the alleged control we&#039;re supposed to have over our bodies and our livelihood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I don&#039;t think the Holland example is foolproof either, if you look at the Wikipedia article on Holland and Prostitution, which unfortunately I cannot link here.
