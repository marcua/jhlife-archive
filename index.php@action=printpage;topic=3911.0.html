				Trophy apartments only appear once in a blue moon and this top floor, 1400+ square foot 4 BR/2.5 BA represents the cream of the crop. The living room with wood burning fireplace and the formal dining room offer sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline. The large bedrooms all face the elegant interior courtyard. The whole apartment has been carefully renovated. The windowed kitchen has a dishwasher, w/d, and an adjacent butler&#039;s pantry with original cabinetry. All plumbing has been replaced in the main bathrooms and the pre-war tiling and tubs have been preserved. The hardwood floors are refinished, all of the walls are replaced, and new electrical has been installed throughout. This home is located in The Towers, the most exclusive, landmark buildings in Jackson Heights, a historic district consistently praised for its stately pre-war buildings, green streets, and multicultural cuisines. The building has a children&#039;s playground and is a short walk to the E/F/V/R/7 trains. And Manhattan is only a 15 minute ride away! If you&#039;re looking for all the pre-war beauty of Brooklyn and Manhattan for half the price, then this home will do your dreams justice. OPEN HOUSES SAT 1/9 AND SAT 1/16 FROM 12 PM TO 2 PM.

				The children&#039;s playground is such a bonus in this neighborhood! There is a separate &#039;adult&#039; garden.

				I have to agree with Native, 729K for our neighborhood seems excessive. Friends of mine bought a whole house here for this much. Nice apartment either way.

				Having purchased my apartment in, yes, the 1960&#039;s, and SO young! :rockon: I look at the prices now and wonder if this is the same neighborhood.<br /><br />Remember, this is the asking price. Stay tuned for the reality reveal. Unless that is private, then forget I ever mentioned it. 8)

				I agree. 729k is too much for this neighborhood, especially when you really CAN buy a house for that much here. We&#039;re going to the open house anyway though. I&#039;ve always wondered what the layouts and amenities are like in the Towers.

				There are two ways of looking at this listing and please note that this is the asking price, everything is negotiable.<br /><br />1. &nbsp;There may be someone that appreciates the space, doesn&#039;t want the hassle of living in a house, and loves having gardens, a children&#039;s playground, the option of a 10% downpayment, the acceptance of dogs, the no subletting policy, the grand living and dining room, the fireplace, and four exposures.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;There may be many that are not comfortable with the price as they wouldn&#039;t be interested in spending that amount of money, because they can&#039;t afford it, although they want to comment prior to viewing the property. &nbsp;In addition to other personal reasons.<br /><br />And yes there is the reality of the comps/recent sales. &nbsp;At this point that hasn&#039;t been disclosed and unless you<br />have done your due diligence, no one can say what the last sale has been other than the agent representing the property, the seller and the management office for the Towers.<br /><br />For the moment, I think that everyone should back off and let the real estate agent and the seller do their thing. &nbsp;I don&#039;t believe that many that are attempting to sell their property would appreciate reading these negative posts relating to the price prior to an Open House. &nbsp;Give the seller and the agent a break, again everything is negotiable.<br /><br />Therefore, if the asking price is too high and a buyer makes a realistic offer, so be it. &nbsp;They&#039;ll negotiate.<br /><br />Sincerely, a property listed for this amount has no real effect on anyone on this listserve. &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t mean that it will sell for that amount, and ultimately, the only person that will be affected will be the seller. &nbsp;That&#039;s it! &nbsp;Unless I&#039;m missing something.<br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;ll see you all at the Open House!!!! &nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Best, &nbsp; :smiley6600:

				Marlene,<br /><br />We all understand that it&#039;s up to the buyer and the seller to negotiate. We all know that an asking price is nothing but an asking price. After all, many of us are owners. <br /><br />However, what happens in this neighborhood -- in RE and other matters -- does concern all of us who are on this listserv. And once this is posted here -- unlocked -- it is open to discussion. So please don&#039;t try to police this forum. And maybe the discussion will generate more interest that this apt would have received otherwise, it is truly gorgeous. <br /><br />Take care.

				The apartments in the Towers are pretty freaking nice. An acquaintance lives in 3 bedroom on the first floor and the insulation is so good (especially as compared to where I live) that you might as well be in the middle of nowhere. No noise from upstairs, next door, outside AT ALL. The layout is pretty swell as well, lots of separation between the public and private parts of the apartment. Couple that with being on a top floor, well we&#039;ll see what it gets, but I don&#039;t think that $700K+ has been arrived at by somebody throwing darts at a board...

				Without knowing specifics on this unit, I see that other units in the towers have pushed past 700,000 in the past few years (Dec &#039;07, Nov &#039;08), and one last spring went for nearly that much. It&#039;ll be interesting to watch this one!
