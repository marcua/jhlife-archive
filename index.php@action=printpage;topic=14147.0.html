				Here&#039;s a link to an article from <strong>New York Magazine</strong> about small, independently owned businesses, and how they manage to survive amidst the onslaught of rising commercial rents in the city.&nbsp; According to the article, while many people do shop at big box retailers, the mom and pops continue to fill a niche for shoppers locally.&nbsp; The article references Jackson Heights&#039; Frank&#039;s Pharmacy, and how the move to its current location, post-fire, has positively impacted its business.&nbsp; The take-away is that the small shop owner is in a position to provide better service on a personal level, something most folks can appreciate.<br /><br />Whatever Youâ€™ve Heard, Independent Retail in New York Is Thriving (http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/12/independent-retail-in-new-york-is-thriving.html)

				Also the small produce stores usually offer better quality and prices than the supermarkets - all else apart they aren&#039;t locked into weekly pricing. Picked up nice blueberries at Lemon Tree this week for $1. The thrill of the chase!<br />&nbsp;

				Sure, WE know it, try telling that to the landlords! I still think somebody should look into how cities like San Francisco, Asheville, Cambridge etc. have put legislation in place to incentivize property owners to keep established neighborhood businesses in place and encourage new, locally owned businesses to open. Rather than turning everything into a chain store strip mall.
