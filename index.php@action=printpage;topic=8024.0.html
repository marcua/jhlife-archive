				I like walking around Elmhurst General Hospital that runs from 82nd Street to 77th Street.&nbsp; It&#039;s 6/10th of a mile around the hospital.&nbsp; No streets to cross.&nbsp; If you need to rest they have a very nice park alongside the parking lot on Broadway.&nbsp; If you need to use a rest room or get a drink of water you can use the hospital facilities located at Broadway &amp; 79th St.&nbsp; In the lower level is Au Bon Pain which is open to the public (incredible coffee).&nbsp; <br />

				For me, basically anywhere above Northern Blvd in the 70&#039;s/80&#039;s for jogging.&nbsp;

				Here&#039;s a few that I used while training for the NYC Marathon. They can be shortened to meet your needs and are a great way to explore Queens:<br /><br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/128717131 (http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/128717131) This one is my favorite - it goes through JH, Corona, Forest Hills, Forest Hills Gardens (Gorgeous), Forest Park, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, along the Flushing Bay waterfront and back to JH. You could definitely reverse the course and go directly to Flushing Bay and back which would be about 6 miles or so.<br /><br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/139361967 (http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/139361967) - JH to Astoria Park and back.<br /><br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/138953399 (http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/138953399) - JH to Central Park and back.

				As soon as you get off Roosevelt, it gets much nicer. A quick 5K in the historic district could look like this: <br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/137030301<br /><br />For shorter runs, I&#039;ll head north of Northern and go through the blocks there - I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever taken the same route twice. <br /><br />For longer runs, I&#039;ll head out through the historic district on 35th or 34th and head towards Flushing Meadows Park, and sometimes past it along the greenway that continues through the botanical gardens, out to Kissena Park.<br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/29173364<br />http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/132608641<br />&nbsp;<br />- Marcus<br /><br />(PS - Hi, Matt!)

				I used to run along 34th avenue between broadway and junction blvd, which has a bike lane (these days i&#039;m lazy).&nbsp; It&#039;s about 1.5 miles each way or 3 miles roundtrip.&nbsp; I used to head out around 6am when traffic was light and run in the bike lane, which was great to avoid pedestrians on the sidewalk and there aren&#039;t many bikes out that early.&nbsp; I always tried to be curtious and move to the sidewalk if I saw bikes coming my way (I run opposite the bikes and traffic) and never got any dirty looks, but have always been curious what bikers think of runners using the bike lanes.
