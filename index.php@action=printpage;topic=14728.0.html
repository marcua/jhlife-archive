				<strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Farmer Presentation at Farm Spot&nbsp; </span><br />Thursday, April 21st, 5:30-7:00pm <br />St. Mark’s Church 33-50 82nd St. Jackson Heights</strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Ever wondered what Farm Spot is and how it works?&nbsp; Want to learn more about Community Supported Agriculture?&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Come meet Maggie Wood and Matt Kurek, the farmers from Golden Earthworm Organic Farm, the farm that provides all the vegetables for Farm Spot! Come see what CSA is all about! Meet some of your Jackson Heights neighbors!<br />Raffle of a Golden Earthworm t-shirt and tote bag!<br /><br />Farm Spot is the Jackson Heights CSA and has been running for 10 years. At the end of May, we will begin our 11th year! CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) is a model where neighborhood groups partner with a local farm. Each member of the group pre-pays for a share of the farm’s bounty. This model is beneficial to everyone! It gives the farmers a guaranteed income, which they receive upfront, when they need it most; it gives each member very fresh, affordable, organic produce that was grown locally (in our case, the farm is 70 miles away), and also a chance to get to know our farm and our farmers).<br /><br />Maggie and Matt will talk about the history of the farm, which is in Jamesport, Long Island. She will also discuss how a CSA works, the many different types of vegetables grown on the farm, the challenges of running a certified organic farm, who works on the farm, and much more! <br /><br />There will be a raffle of a Golden Earthworm t-shirt and tote bag which will be announced at 6:45pm!<br /><br />Stop by with your questions and curiosity about CSA. Farm Spot is now taking new members for the 2016 season, which starts at the end of May.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">All are welcome!!</span><br /><br />farmspot@gmail.com<br /></span>
