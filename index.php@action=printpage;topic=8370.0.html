				Well, wishful thinking here as well but I would even appreciate higher-end ethnic food where atmosphere isn&#039;t an afterthought like Casa Enrique or Tortilleria Nixtamal, both of which are decorated nicely and patronized/loved by visitors and locals alike.&nbsp; I do feel that even in terms of ethnic food we are limited by the quality and general atmosphere of the area. While Jackson Heights is definitely a culinary destination for certain types of cuisines (Himalayan, Colombian, Ecuadorian), we definitely do not do the other categories that we are known for justice.&nbsp; My South Asian friends cite the temples in Flushing or Manhattan restaurants like Chola, Dhaba, Tiffin Wallah, Saravana as their choices for the best, authentic Indian dining (each restaurant is explores different regional cuisines).&nbsp; Even La Portena which is very cute could use a little spice in the kitchen - it&#039;s not cheap, but the food is tired and not inventive and Argentinians prefer El Amacen and Cafe Argentino; both better and cheaper.&nbsp; On the Mexican front Casa Enrique in LIC, Ponche in Hell&#039;s Kitchen, and the aforementioned Tortilleria are culinary heavyweights without sacrificing price or atmosphere.&nbsp; We are blessed with a population of global chefs with some serious homey/cart-cooking skills - wouldn&#039;t it be great if we had an ethnic restaurant with food that&#039;s slightly elevated to not meet the bottom line?&nbsp; I know a few places on Northern are beginning to pop up like this and that&#039;s great - love that Pisco Bar.&nbsp; I wish it were closer to 37.&nbsp; As the kids reviewing Taco Bell in Jeff&#039;s post so astutely pointed out, atmosphere is a very important ingredient to an overall dining experience. <br />

				I can say for certain that the jackson heights farmers market has a lot of people who patronize it. So going along with that, I think somewhere that caters to local ingredients with items in the 9-15 dollar price range would do pretty well. however, novo is quite a big space, not sure what the rent is, but they&#039;d have to have a lot of throughput to do well. <br /><br />i think a better coffee shop might do well - like the queens kickshaw. they create a community aspect with the coffee, but also sell a lot with the alcohol at night. people need somewhere to hang out around here.

				I just sent an email to the folks that run Owl&#039;s Head in Bay Ridge. I feel like our neighborhood is a similar market (not too trendy, diverse, with a base of middle-class people who would patronize a slightly nicer/upscale bar), so I asked if they had ever considered the neighborhood and gave them the address of the now defunct Novo. So fingers crossed... if you can think of anyone else who might be a potential for that space, email them. Right? Couldn&#039;t hurt to be proactive!

				Alas...the issue, as always here in JH... is the commercial rents charged by the landlords.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s ironic.&nbsp; Residential rents are affordable in JH.&nbsp; But commercial rents here are on par with the fancier areas of Manhattan.<br /><br />That&#039;s why JH landlords choose 99 cent stores.&nbsp; They pay the most rent...due to having the lowest overheads...no spoilage, minimal staff etc.<br /><br />Proactive ideas are great...but bar owners will always face the same dilemma.&nbsp; <br /><br />The rents are too high in JH to take risks with an interesting bar or other business.<br /><br />Single landlords own entire blocks of commercial premises here in JH...unlike many other &#039;hoods. Absent landlords have fixed commercial rents at exorbitant levels.<br /><br />That&#039;s the only reason we&#039;re limited in our options of stores/venues on 37th Ave here in JH.<br /><br />So JH has the most spacious, awesome, affordable apartments in all of NYC...but our commercial strips are functional and uninspired...due to the disproportionate residential/commercial rent disparity.<br /><br />&nbsp;JH...because of its historic and beautiful housing...is definitely the best neighborhood in NYC apartment-wise.&nbsp; But unfortunately not commercially... <br /><br />

				jeff, since i&#039;ve lived on 35th for a while, i wonder about the rents there. the north side of the street has had long-term commercial tenants with very little turnover (and not huge $ businesses -- dry cleaner, beauty salon, health store) but the south side where alchemy and lin&#039;s kitchen are is in constant flux, with discount stores and south asian groceries opening and closing every year or two. two different landlord mindsets, i guess.

				Let&#039;s be honest.&nbsp; 37th Ave is the natural boulevard for JH. <br /><br />It was planned that way in 1920&#039;s.<br /><br />And 37th Ave is the obvious site for bars/interesting venues/great stores.<br /><br />Promenading down 37th Ave in Jackson Heights is aesthetically pleasing...because of how it was designed. Charming really.&nbsp; And far more attractive than say Court or Smith or 5th Avenue in Brooklyn...and even most streets in Manhattan.<br /><br />That is...apart from the majority of uninspiring stores that exist along 37th Ave...<br />The architecture is impressive.&nbsp; The retail...not so much.<br /><br />I believe the only way a situation might be challenged is to expose it to the light.<br />Until now the landlords and their agents operate under shady situations. <br />No-one knows how much anyone else pays for their rent. And that&#039;s how landlords are able to maintain their level of price fixing here in JH.&nbsp; By keeping folks in the dark.<br /><br />Either the situation can be taken to the press...or lists of rents paid circulated to everyone...<br />and only then possibly...might these landlords/agents be exposed as rent gougers.<br /><br />And PERHAPS shamed into fairness.<br /><br />My guess is that many of the new English speaking retail tenants have no idea about their rights (or lack thereof) in these commercial situations. <br /><br />In truth I am certainly no expert and have no idea how commercial rights work...though I have learned one thing.&nbsp; New York City can be particularly Byzantine when it comes to rules and regulations...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				i lived in the east village right around the time it &quot;evolved&quot; from neighborhood to theme park, circa 1983, 84, 85. the same conversation was ubiquitous at the time. but for different reasons.mom and pop places were evicted after decades, only to be replaced by useless boutiques or galleries that failed after 6-9 months, leaving spaces empty for one, two, five years.<br /><br />we learned then that you can&#039;t force someone to use their property the way you want to, as opposed to the way that they want to. for better or worse, private property owners have rights. things here are not likely to change until someone shows a landlord that they can make more money by litening to the community, not by appealing to their non-existent &quot;better side.&quot;

				I really think the &quot;wish list&quot; of the folks on this message board is pretty modest and very understandable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here for seven plus years. When Starbucks moved in, there was hysteria that the neightborhood would explode with gentrification. At least people have a civilized place to go for a cup of coffee and some relaxing atmosphere, but we have yet to see the traumatic change forecasted. (yes I know about Espresso 77 but it seats about 20 people.) I have a &quot;Abundacia&quot; bakery moving across the street from me, with it&#039;s glaring yellow illuminated sign. It&#039;s directly accross the street from another bakery just like it and within spitting distance of about a thousand others. I would love a Starbucks down my end of the nieghborhood, if only for novelty sake. There I&#039;ve said it!!! <br />If someone opened up another shop like Espresso 77 that would be fine too.

				By comparison I was in Greenpoint yesterday...now that&#039;s a booming neighborhood... and noticed that 1000 square feet commercial spaces were for lease (Nassau Street)... at under $5000 per month. Which is maybe why there are so many quirky and cute and idiosyncratic bars and places opening up there....<br /><br />At half Jackson Heights commercial rent prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />That gives us an idea of where are...commercial rent-wise... compared with the rest of NYC...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But on the other hand...residential rents are much less expensive in JH than in Greenpoint....<br /><br />Go figure?<br /><br />Basically...it&#039;s affordable to live in JH... but expensive to open a business here.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				the residential boom is relatively new. it&#039;s funny, the franklin street apartment i rented for $300 (total) in the late &#039;80s was recently put on the market -- gutted and redone, admittedly -- for $3,500. yes, rates have gone up, but 1200 percent seems like a lot to me :)

				I wish JH&#039;s landlords were more creative about their tenants and more proactive about seeking a more vibrant commerical mix, but I doubt they&#039;re uniquely greedy.&nbsp; I expect their interest in seeking top dollar is about the same as landlords everywhere.&nbsp; I think the real question is why the market in JH will bear prices that are much higher than elsewhere.&nbsp; And I think the answer to that is that the prices are an unfortunate consequence of the design of our beautiful planned community.&nbsp; We have high residential densities in the historic district, but virtually no commercial frontage.&nbsp; 34th Avenue, 35th Avenue, and most of our streets are nearly completely void of commercial space.&nbsp; &nbsp;And many of the commercial spaces along Roosevelt, 37th Avenue, and Northern Blvd. are actually quite small compared with the spaces available in many other neighborhoods.&nbsp; There are just too many customers chasing too little commercial space.<br /><br /><br />What are the solutions to this?&nbsp; One solution could be to build more commercial space.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s virtually impossible in the Historic District, but could be achieved elsewhere with supportive zoning.&nbsp; We could allow denser commercial development south of 37th Avenue on 75th, 76th, and 77th Streets, for example.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or we could encourage higher commercial and residential development densities along Northern Blvd. west of 78th Street.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Of course, there&#039;s no chance this will happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;The community strongly resisted commercial development on 73rd Street, and would be unlikely to support rezoning elsewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#039;s a policy choice by the community, and I believe astronomical rents are its consequence.

				I don&#039;t see how we have too little comercial space. Taking into account 37th avenue , 82nd street and Roosevelt Avenue, Northern Blvd.) there&#039;s a ton of it.

The landlords preventing smaller more innovative businesses from getting a chance in the neighborhood by having prohibitive rents, and the few we do have from expanding into larger spaces for the same reason.<br /><br />I think anything with the word &quot;dense&quot; in it is not good for JH, which is already too dense as it is.

				and we should have commerical space on side streets in the historic district? No way. There&#039;s a reason these avenues and streets are desirable. Putting stores in the historic district would be corrosive to the fabric of life in the residential district. It&#039;s difficult enough dealing with the noise and garbage (and crime) dragged off of Roosevelt and 37th. 37th avenue is the main commercial avenue for the historic district, to keep the residential area from descending into a hellish mess.

				I&#039;ve done a little bit of research on Starbucks&#039;s leasing practices because, honestly, I found it hard to believe that a Landlord would give them this kind of power. As it turns out, they are being sued in a class-action suit in Seattle for this and other practices they utilize to wipe out competition. You can read about it here:<br />http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starbucks-accused-of-abusing-monopoly-power-in-violation-of-sherman-act-57142892.html<br /><br />They have also fallen victim to the same practices used by McDonald&#039;s, which, for all we know, is where they got the idea. See details here:<br />http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-04-22/news/0604220176_1_lease-retailers-mcdonald<br /><br />So, after all that, it is certainly plausible that they have a lease that restricts competition, and that competition is very broadly defined in their lease. Such a bummer for our neighborhood.<br /><br />One final note (and possibly glimmer of hope)... I also did some digging around public records of some city agencies (Buildings and Finance, to be exact), and it appears that while this particular landlord owns this particular block, they don&#039;t appear to be affiliated with any other property in the area. That&#039;s not to say they&#039;re not operating under multiple names, but I would think that Starbucks&#039;s stranglehold is limited to buildings with the same lease ownership as their own, and is therefore limited to their current block. Here&#039;s to hoping, anyway.

				I&#039;ve always wondered why the excellent Salt &amp; Fat (http://www.saltandfatny.com/) in Sunnyside serves dessert but not coffee. Could it be because there&#039;s a Dunkin Donuts two doors down and a Starbucks a couple of blocks away?<br /><br />Whatever the reason, a lack of coffee hasn&#039;t hurt their culinary creativity or popularity. I actually liked Novo and was sorry to see them go. I had high hopes for a new restaurant to open in its place -- a nice cafe or bistro, hopefully not another <em>pollo a la brasa</em> or curry buffet. I don&#039;t know why a neighborhood like Astoria can have such a remarkable range of dining options -- everything from hole-in-the-wall Croatian <em>burek</em> joints to big quick-service chains like Panera -- and Jackson Heights does not attract the same diversity.

				Elda, one could argue that nepalese, indian, peruvian, korean, colombian, argentinian, uruguayan, mexican, tibetan and thai would add up to a remarkable variety of dining options. Maybe you mean that you want more European-style restaurants?<br /><br />If yes, perhaps the large Greek migration to Astoria would help to explain why there is more European cuisine there. Not only Greek restaurants, but also restaurants from neighboring countries, like Croatia. On the same token, the large South American presence in JH helps explain why so many Mexican migrants came the area more recently.<br /><br />In any case, it&#039;s difficult to sustain that JH is a bad place to find good and varied food. Although, yes, frufru is not our strongest point.

I don&#039;t consider that &quot;frufru.&quot; I sometimes get the feeling that people are afraid that if Jackson Heights gets one place serving brunch, the neighborhood will morph into some barren hipster hellscape. I get it -- I&#039;ve lived here my whole life, more than 40 years, and I don&#039;t want to see JH turn into Williamsburg or Park Slope, and frankly, I don&#039;t think it would. Other old Queens neighborhoods have managed to diversify their dining experiences without sacrificing their character, so we should look to places like Astoria as a model, not Williamsburg.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to hear that Novo was such a blight on the neighborhood! I didn&#039;t live close by, and my dining experience there was always positive -- I had no idea what was going on there after hours. Yikes.

All of your restaurant suggestions would be welcome. But the changes in Astoria and Williamsburg were not planned. These things depend on the kind of people who live in the area and the kind of places they go to. Entrepreneurs see opportunity and do it.<br /><br />As Jeff said, the restaurants that we have survive because of a faithful ethnic consumer base. You have to commit to the places that you like to eat. A nice bistro that only had action on Sunday brunch would go broke.

My definition of diversity is a little broader -- I&#039;d love to have more options in terms of both cuisine and atmosphere. <br /><br />As others have noted, a bistro or pub in this neighborhood would never go broke -- in fact, the worst thing about it would probably be trying to get a table on a Friday night. The aforementioned Salt &amp; Fat opened up on a tacky strip of Queens Boulevard, overshadowed by the el, with such &quot;trendy&quot; neighbors as CVS, Lowery Liquors and Dunkin Donuts -- and yet the place is always packed. Cannelle Patisserie lives on the LaGuardia landing-strip wilderness of 31st Avenue -- but you have to wait on line there at just about any time of day. Who would have thought there was a big market for inventive, small-plate cuisine or elegant French pastry in these neighborhoods? But if you build it -- and it&#039;s any good -- they will come. And that&#039;s no joke.<br /><br />

				First off, Latin America and Asia are CONTINENTS. <br /><br />-----<br /><br />Alchemy is here and it&#039;s good. have you been there? Where are you spending your money?&nbsp; As Abu was alluding to, these type of places open up because of a hole in real estate prices. Nice places in williamsburg that are currently opening up are not in the same situation as 37th ave. They are in areas where consumers are proven to be into that type of space. &quot;Cool&quot; places started b/c they found that the rent very low and they could try something out. Where can you try something out in JH?? Alchemy came because they got a great deal and a unique opportunity in that space and that smoker. Where are there other great spaces? <br />I&#039;ll tell you where, at places like Dhauligiri, which shares a space with a roti maker on 72nd street. Phayul, which is on the 2nd floor on 37th Rd. Canelle Patisserie on the LaGuardia landing-strip wilderness of 31st Avenue. <br /><br />Out in the exposed locations with high rents just don&#039;t have the evidence that their place will be successful here. Yes, Starbucks will be successful b/c there&#039;s no others around and people flock to chain places everywhere. Why do you think dominos, papa johns, famiglia exists in NYC - the greatest pizza city on earth. You can&#039;t justify 10k in rent, practically anywhere. <br /><br />ilivehere too-&nbsp; No way can you say that the Starbucks clientele denotes that any independent business should open up here. If anything, it proves that people are just mindless followers, care more about convenience than about their own neighborhood&#039;s wealth. It says that people should open up franchises here. <br /><br />A better sign would be Juju&#039;s and e77 having lines out the door at all times - but they don&#039;t have it. Starbucks is for the unconscious. These two places are cute, with great quality ( I love Juju&#039;s ), but to be honest, they are too quiet for how talented and out of place they are in this neighborhood. <br /><br />I gg, I&#039;m getting pissy.

I disagree with your characterization of these people, they are not mindless, most of them are well educated, just looking for a quiet place to socialize or do work, without having a soccer game blaring from a giant screen tv..

My husband doesn&#039;t even drink coffee. But my point is that the people in Starbucks will eat at a bistro, and there are a lot of these people here now, and moving into the neighborhood. They like Starbucks and they like Espresso 77, except that it seats like 10 people.<br /><br />&nbsp;Your statement is insulting, because I am one of the people you fear. Does the fact that my husband is from the Caribbean give me a pass?&nbsp; We have higher degrees from University. Should we apologize?<br /><br />i moved into this neighborhood eight years ago.

				From what I&#039;m hearing, the only reasonable statement being given for the lack of new types of restaurants is the high rent here, which is notably higher than other surrounding areas.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s too bad but I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s much that can be done about it.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve just come to accept it, and learned to embrace what is here and I leave the area when I crave things I can&#039;t find here.&nbsp; But don&#039;t think for one second I wouldn&#039;t support local establishments because I do so every day.&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;ve only been here a year and a half, but I&#039;m no mindless follower either.&nbsp; I have been to Alchemy, Expresso 77, Table Wine, Jahns, Pequena Colombiana, Arunee Thai, Chili Chicken, and yes, Starbucks, among many others.&nbsp; I enjoy them all and gladly spend my money here.&nbsp; From the food carts to the fast food or quick eat places, I have enjoyed the diversity in Latin American and Asian cuisines here.&nbsp; Sometimes I do want something different.&nbsp; I know there are others like me here and I see them every day.&nbsp; At the end of the day, I think we all do enjoy living in Jackson Heights and there&#039;s nothing bad in wanting something new in any of our storefronts here.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m kind of in agreement with the folks that are saying that we, as a neighborhood, wouldn&#039;t quite be able to support a bistro, and throwing Starbucks into the conversation is comparing apples and oranges. As someone said in a previous post, Starbucks is a place that people will go to and read, work, stay a while; a brunch place or bistro wouldn&#039;t allow that, and would require a packed house and fast turn-over every night and weekend in order to make rent, let alone profit. Juju&#039;s, and even Alchemy, are the more apt comparisons for the kind of business a bistro would drum up, and these places aren&#039;t exactly bursting at the seams with patrons; luckily for them, they&#039;re not paying 37 Ave rents, and seem to be making do. <br /><br />If you&#039;re longing for some different options/American food, I encourage you to try a burger at Cassidy&#039;s up on 31st Ave. It&#039;s a bit of a walk, but the burger is solid, and the regulars, while usually over-served, are friendly and entertaining. And if you want a Starbucks alternative, but would like to stay put longer than the E77 time limit, venture up to Coffeed on Northern Blvd. It&#039;s a couple miles (a good walk in this lovely fall weather we&#039;ve been having), or a few stops on the Q66 bus or M/R (to 36). The coffee is fantastic, the food is good, and you can linger as long as you like. Oh, and the Brooklyn Grange farm is on the roof of the building, so you can go up and check that out too! It&#039;s pretty awesome.<br /><br />

				dssjh...your right...there is no one answer...but I can hardly believe that&nbsp; say, a fabric store, of which there is a surplus of, paying astronomical rent and making a living, is being supported by Jackson Heights dwellers.

It&#039;s clear that many of the people who shop in Jackson Heights do not live here. Just look at the license plates of all the double parked idling cars on 37th Avenue.

				Petster: The size of those fabric shops is <strong>tiny</strong> and yes, a lot of people <strong>do</strong> make their own clothes and quilts. Maybe even people in the Historic District.

				While the bistro debate has been entertaining, it will be of little use if nobody acts. A suggestion to those who are interested in a bistro: put your money where your mouth is. If you want a bistro, a pub, American cuisine, all natural or other fancier restaurant to come to JH, you should do a kickstarter.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t know what is kickstater, look here:<br />http://www.kickstarter.com/start<br /><br />This is an example showing kickstarter being used to raise money for a restaurant:<br />http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1448509144/forno-moto-bringing-pizza-napoletana-to-trade-stre?ref=live<br /><br /><strong>One way this could work</strong> <br />1. people interested in a bistro create a group.<br />2. they approach a handful of restaurants in other neighborhoods that they think would do well in JH. Ask how much they&#039;d need to open a place here and find a candidate.<br />3. the group starts a campaign to raise money via kickstarter.<br />4. If enough money is raised, the bistro would commit to open a JH branch.<br /><br />Email me if you are interested. (Frankly, I don&#039;t think that this will take off. But I hate to just talk talk talk.)

				I second Shelby2&#039;s recommendations. The one next to Vision Center is especially good. I got a beautiful piece of tropical worsted pinstripe that I used to upholster a stool. And the people in there are so nice! Huge selection for a small space.<br /><br />The other one is okay, too. <br /><br />The one between 80 &amp; 79th is too disorganized for me.<br /><br />Abu - you are so right about forming a group and/or using Kickstarter. The 78th Play Street started out as a group of parents who wanted more room for the kids to play, now, thanks to the amazing hard, uphill work, we&#039;ve got the Play Street and are close to having 2 blocks of PARK!!!<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;ve digressed.

				I realize I may have ruffled a few feathers by suggesting Starbucks goers are mindless, because almost EVERYONE goes there. I just get so frustrated that Juju&#039;s lines aren&#039;t out the door and even e77s aren&#039;t overwhelmed with business. I walk past and think if there were that many people inside a mom and pop shop, how much more positive impact that would create. People go to what they know, people make safe decisions. You can get a coffee at a ton of other places, but people pay more for it at Starbucks because they know exactly what they are going to get. And no higher education, miseducation, place of birth, spouse of choice is going to get you a pass for sending your money to Seattle when you could get a coffee at Lety&#039;s. <br /><br />What the demographic would support and what makes a good business decision are two different things. There are probably spaces near Alchemy which have much lower rent, I would think there are no 10k rents there.&nbsp; -- I do think some place like Queens Kickshaw would do well here though. I think the demographic would support that. Also, with the popularity of the farmers market, I think there might even be space for a family oriented local market type place to eat.&nbsp; <br /><br />But considering how big NYC is, I would never rent out a space for such an exorbitant amount. Maybe I don&#039;t think big enough.

				I wasn&#039;t really asking for a pass from anyone, I was trying to be ironic. <br /><br />My husband is best friends with our dry cleaners on 37th. I hope that balances out the ocassional cup of Starbucks on the way to the the Met grocery store, or back from the Lemon Farm. Geez.

				Do I have in ECG the first to join &quot;the&quot; group? It would be good if we could have at least 3 to 5 people. Anyone else? The tasks would be easier that it main seem.

				This afternoon the windows of the old Novo place were papered over, and there was obvious reconstruction going on inside. I barged in and conversed with the guys working in there, whom may or may not have been the Arunee owners themselves. But they spoke like proud papas about the fact that the space is, indeed, going to be the newly-moved Arunee – this time with a full bar [same place that Novo had it.]<br /><br />This is something of a dream come true: the great Arunee cuisine, brought to a great locale on the Ave. Excellent!

I guess they think their products aren&#039;t good enough to stand up on their own merits. I do like that they are apparently good places to work (maybe I&#039;m behind the times on that one, but last I heard they were) and they are usually clean.

JuJu has great bagels and his tuna salad bagels and wraps are great, and he also makes this fantastic citrus based salad dressing. And he also serves Illy coffee which I like. Same with E77, the Honey Mint Limonata is a great summer treat, and the new orleans is nice for when you want a richer coffee drink. Every once in a while we&#039;ll get the E77 french toast for &quot;brunch&quot;.
