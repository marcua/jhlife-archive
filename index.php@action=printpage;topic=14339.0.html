This is part of why they&#039;re trying to upgrade the signals. <br /><br />But there&#039;s also the issue of line length. They extended the G down to Church Avenue to serve booming parts of Brooklyn, and if they extend it the other way without adding train sets, you end up back at the bad old days of extremely infrequent G service to the G-only neighborhoods.

And if you look at the map, it shows all the ports serviced by the ferry system. If they&#039;re already there, why not use them?

Add some train sets and you could definitely bring Gs back on weekends, for instance, though - I&#039;m not sure why they don&#039;t do that, other than not wanting to buy more trains.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here&#039;s another radical idea.

The midtown and LIC piers are both a long walk from anything, and to use them is generally a three-mode journey - bus (walk) ferry (walk) bus or train. People don&#039;t want to have to walk blocks in the cold to transfer between transit modes, and they generally want two modes max.

				we need to serve people who are without service before we add more trains to an already well-served area.people who live around Astoria Park - and there are many - now have to walk 12-15 blocks to get to a train, people who live in Red Hook even longer than that. this is a great idea, and hopefully it can get done within a few years of planned opening.

				I sit next to the guy who runs this project (at work) and he let me play with the models they used to investigate possible routes. It was fun but very confusing - there are just so many constraints. Anyway, JH was not a viable option because it&#039;s supposed to be a waterfront route. I kept trying to shift it to JH but I got my hand smacked (literally).

				BEB, definitely aimed at real esate fat cats. Because they are and have been looking at all those waterfront communities. <br />I know someone who is working on this project. Has been stalled to actually make the connection into Queens. Having problems with getting the streetcar over the bridge. So right now, they&#039;ve been approved only for sections in Brooklyn. Defeats the whole purpose.

At the very least, it is delayed. Supporters now question whether a groundbreaking could happen before Mr. de Blasio leaves office at the end of 2021.<br /><br />In a recent radio interview, Mr. de Blasio insisted that the streetcar was still on.<br /><br />“We’re moving forward, but we have to get the exact details right,” the mayor said on WNYC on Friday, calling the proposal “a big complicated endeavor.”<br /><br />Click link above for NY Times article

				The stupidest idea to come out of the mayor’s office. Why spend millions to build a streetcar for something that could be done by an articulated bus? Rail is inflexible and cannot be rerouted and makes snow removal difficult. This boondoggle will never the light of day.

They have a really efficient and cheap &quot;trolley&quot; system. The trollies are triple-articulated buses with dedicated travel lanes (separated from car traffic). That would be much cheaper--though less charming--than the proposed street car project. Is it inconvenient for cars? Yep. Does it serve way more people than cars? Yep.

				Both Seattle and Portland have effective streetcars as well as many many European cities. Though they do have the chance of being affected by traffic, will cost a lot less to execute when it is compared to new subway lines.&nbsp; And if they probably higher capacity numbers than more buses on the road.

				Just because it’s costs less than the billions spent on the second avenue subway doesn’t make it a good idea. Just think if you have a water main break, you have to suspend service. Thousands would left without service. In China they have started an electric streetcar that requires no rails.
