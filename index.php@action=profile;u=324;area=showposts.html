These are GIANT loaves.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kim&#039;s prices are more than fair for the quality and consistency of the loaves, the inventiveness of her flavors, and the knowledge that your bread is literally made in situ in a wood-fired oven.&nbsp; Order a small loaf, and see if you won&#039;t be salivating as you wait for the next e-mail alerting you to the coming week&#039;s offerings.

					Gotta put in another good word for Los Amigos pizza.&nbsp; The guy who runs the pizza oven is super nice, and the pizzas are INCREDIBLE!&nbsp; The crust is uncannily thin and crispy and the topping combinations are inspired.&nbsp; I&#039;d skip the margarita and go for the Al Pastor, Hawaiian, or Avocado Pepperoni.&nbsp; Delivery is fast, as is take out.&nbsp; It&#039;s cash only, so bring your greenbacks.&nbsp; For a standard slice or pie, Sac&#039;s is undoubtedly a great option, but these cracker-thin pizzas are a totally different experience and, if you&#039;re like me, an experience you&#039;ll suddenly find yourself craving almost daily.&nbsp; Support them, if not for your taste buds&#039; sake, but also to keep independent, affordable innovation alive and well in JH!

					I think it&#039;s well worth remembering that the folks involved in the Queensboro made a big commitment to doing something different in the neighborhood--a thoughtful, inviting, large-scale venue with interesting cocktails and a fresh, ever-changing menu.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been about five times so far and it has always been packed with a diverse cross-section of people seeming to enjoy their time there.&nbsp; The drinks are excellent and the food is good and, I&#039;d say, improving as they work out the kinks of opening a large and busy venue.&nbsp; The service is a work in progress, but friendly and accommodating, which is more than you can say about many places in the city.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just me, but when a place is new I like to give it the benefit of the doubt, and if there&#039;s something not to my liking I prefer to address that with the wait staff at the end of the meal (hoping that the comments make it back to the kitchen), rather than blasting them with a one-star Yelp review or scorching them in public fora.&nbsp; In any case, I&#039;ll be back there in the future, and look forward to their long tenure in the neighborhood.&nbsp;

					The bahn mi at Addictive are seriously next level.&nbsp; Since moving to JH from Los Angeles eleven years ago, I&#039;ve searched the boroughs for a good bahn mi.&nbsp; There was a place in Chinatown about eight years ago that was pretty good, but it closed down.&nbsp; Pho Bac is pretty good for pho and pork chops, but their bahn mi are abysmal.&nbsp; Thai Son is convenient but mediocre all around.&nbsp; JoJu in Elmhurst is disappointing at best.&nbsp; Bun-ker has a half-decent bahn mi (and a killer pho, and some legit entrees), if you&#039;re willing to schlep out to an industrial wasteland in Ridgewood and stand outside for an hour.&nbsp; It&#039;s been pretty grim on the vietnamese sandwich scene.&nbsp; But...&nbsp; <br /><br />ADDICTIVE&#039;S BAHN MI ARE THE REAL DEAL.&nbsp; The bread is perfect--crisp and crunchy on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried the original and the chicken so far.&nbsp; The filling hits all the notes--spicy, sweet, salty, sour, umami.&nbsp; The pickles are crunchy and toothsome, there&#039;s just the right amount of spice...the sandwiches are filling and hearty, but also clean and crisp and leave you feeling sated but not logy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The beer selection is fun, and pairs well with the sandwiches (my partner and I tried the Sierra Nevada Tropical IPA and a German white beer I can&#039;t recall--both were delicious).&nbsp; If they did take out, I&#039;d probably pick one up on the way home more than once a week.&nbsp; Even so, I&#039;ll be back often.&nbsp; Sorry for the full-throated rave, but I&#039;m legitimately bowled over that New York City, let alone Jackson Heights, has a fantastic bahn mi place.&nbsp; And it&#039;s within walking distance!&nbsp; Super psyched.&nbsp;

					Welcome to the neighborhood!&nbsp; In past years, there is usually a christmas tree stand on 37th near Ultima Florist (81st or so).&nbsp; There is also a christmas tree stand on Northern between 85th and 86th (in front of the Rite Aid).&nbsp; Not sure about garland and wreaths--they might have those in Ultima Florist?&nbsp; Good luck!

					Very excited about having Sac&#039;s in the nabe!&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken out slices from there a handful of times so far, and have been consistently delighted.&nbsp; The crust is single-pane thin, and bagel-chewy in all the right ways.&nbsp; I think the real winner is the &quot;Mama pizza,&quot; which has fresh basil, pools of mozzarella, sweet red sauce, and plenty of garlic (i.e. Margherita).&nbsp; Platonically delicious!&nbsp; The atmosphere is not particularly winsome for eating in, but man is this some good &#039;za!&nbsp; Haven&#039;t had the chicken or sausage rolls, but they are awfully tempting.&nbsp; For my money, Due Fratelli is the neighborhood place for comforting grandma slices, Thomas&#039;s for a belt-buster chicken and broccoli slice, and Sac&#039;s for a Proustian thin-crust slice.&nbsp;

					My boyfriend and I went to Oceanic Boil tonight for dinner.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my initial take: <br /><br /><strong>Atmosphere: </strong> <br />It&#039;s a cute place--they&#039;ve clearly put a lot of time and energy into making it a unique environment.&nbsp; Yes, there are two TVs (as has been debated at length in the thread), but they are unobtrusive and the sound is muted.&nbsp; There are light fixtures with edison bulbs, custom metalwork chairs (more comfortable than they look!), and colorful paint work. The waitstaff is friendly--you can tell that they are eager, and they care.&nbsp; The soundtrack was Shakira, turned down low.&nbsp; It&#039;s a crab-feed kind of joint, so they put down kraft paper on the table and hand out gloves and crab crackers.&nbsp; You&#039;ll need both.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Food: </strong><br />They are launching with a limited menu--no raw bar, so far.&nbsp; We asked the proprietor, and he said that they hope to get oysters and other raw bar items in soon, but that sourcing is fairly involved.&nbsp; Right now, they have&nbsp; the appetizers and the cooked items.&nbsp; We got the fried calamari, the snow crab, the shrimp, and the fries.&nbsp; The fried calamari was delicious and disappeared quite rapidly.&nbsp; The shrimp are served shell-on, head-on--simple, perfectly cooked--with drawn butter.&nbsp; The snow crab was two sets of legs.&nbsp; They were delicious, though quite a bit of work to crack through to get the meat out.&nbsp; The fries were fine, but really nothing to write home about.&nbsp; They are served with hot sauce.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Drink: </strong><br />The beer list is limited, at least so far.&nbsp; There are a couple of domestics, Heineken, Sapporo, and Guinness.&nbsp; There are some wines, and a plum wine.&nbsp; Sapporo works well with the food, as does the plum wine.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong><br />It&#039;s definitely a work in progress, but a great work in progress.&nbsp; I think they need to make it clear that you&#039;ll be working for your dinner--it&#039;s a casual crabfeed joint, not a take-out or delivery place, and not a place where dinner comes served up neatly on a plate.&nbsp; Heck, there aren&#039;t knives, forks, or spoons!&nbsp; A cool concept and a unique execution.&nbsp; I hope the neighborhood will give it a shot!

					Agree wholeheartedly about Ayada, which is ridiculously good.&nbsp; Still a fan of Sripraphai after all of these years, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit in the back garden.&nbsp; I really like the atmosphere at Kitchen 79, though I think they can be a little heavy-handed with the fish sauce on some of the dishes.&nbsp; But definitely on the short list of go-to Thai places in Jackson Heights proper.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would add Sompong Thai to the list, especially for delivery (I&#039;ve ordered from them more times than I care to disclose publicly).&nbsp; Nothing too advanced or extraordinary, but they reliably scratch the itch for mid-week comfort Thai food, and they deliver quite quickly since they are right in the nabe.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					A pair of pigeons has recently decided to make my terrace their Jackson Heights pied-a-terre, and much as I would like to accommodate them, my co-op has a strict rule against avian terrace sublets.&nbsp; Any tips on how to get rid of unwanted pigeons?&nbsp; Whenever I see them, I go out and shoo them away, but they are pretty persistent, not to mention messy.&nbsp; Thanks!

					I&#039;d like to second Shelby2&#039;s recommendation!&nbsp; Lemon Farm has a surprisingly robust selection of European imported goods, charcuterie, many forms of dairy goods (yogurts, etc.) not readily found elsewhere in our neighborhood, and quality breads.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t purchased a ton of produce there, but when I can&#039;t find a certain vegetable or herb elsewhere, they generally have it, and at not too bad a price.&nbsp; Plus, their collection of beautiful evil eyes behind the counter is unrivaled in JH!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t been there, it&#039;s worth checking out.&nbsp; (Oh, and be sure to look up -- the ceilingscape is adorable).

					My boyfriend and I just went to try out Emoji Burger, and WOW, what a success!&nbsp; The space is cute inside--a little cramped given the small size, but well built-out, with nice lighting and ambiance for a little neigborhood burger joint.&nbsp; As for the burgers themselves.&nbsp; As a devotee of, and regular visitor to, Shake Shack, I can confidently say that that these burgers are just as good, if not better, than Shake Shack&#039;s.&nbsp; Pat LaFrieda beef, Martin&#039;s potato buns, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; Their default doneness is medium, which is just right--the burgers develop that lacy, crispy edge, while still being moist and tender and juicy on the inside.&nbsp; I had the &quot;Ori Emo,&quot; (which is their name for the regular cheeseburger), and my boyfriend had the &quot;Da Wink,&quot; which is the regular cheeseburger with applewood bacon.&nbsp; Both were fantastic.&nbsp; We also split the Emo Fries, which are fries with bacon bits, grated parmesan, scallion, and the house aioli.&nbsp; These were also good, though I actually think I might have preferred just plain fries, as the fries themselves were fried to perfection.&nbsp; One quibble--they bring out packets of ketchup right now, and I think that squeeze bottles at the table might be better (at least for those of us who like generous amounts of ketchup on burgers and fries).&nbsp; <br /><br />Short take:&nbsp; this place, only two days in, is poised to be a neighborhood fixture, if not a destination spot for people in nearby neighborhoods.&nbsp; <strong>SERIOUSLY</strong> good burgers!&nbsp;
