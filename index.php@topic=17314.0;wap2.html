			<br />
			I&#039;ve recently seen day and night photos of Field&#039;s at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue on Facebook pages about Old New York.&nbsp; Does anyone know how long the store was at this location?

			<strong>82nd st lady</strong>:
			<br />
			I know it opened in the spring or summer of 1950. Not sure when it closed.

			<strong>PalestraJon</strong>:
			<br />
			I believe it closed sometime in the 1980s

			&nbsp;I bought my wedding dress there in 1958.&nbsp; It was a lovely store and at the time, considered &quot;upscale.&quot;
