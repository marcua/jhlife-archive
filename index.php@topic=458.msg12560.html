I have offered the *good* news - - that a kennel is not your *only* option for boarding your pet.&nbsp; I have offered *good* and valid information.&nbsp; I have extended a *good* option to you and given you a *good* lead on services that exist (and, in fact, could direct you to a far, far better and more exclusive *kenneling* situation, if your dog would not be suitable for home-boarding, than the *commercial* one you are using).<br /><br />Thus far, I have gotten *three* *NEGATIVE* responses&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; NO positive response, no neutral response (say, a question or two, perhaps). - - but three negative responses.<br /><br />*NOTICE* - - that nothing that I wrote would, rationally, elicit such a negative response (but from, perhaps, a kennel owner), and it would seem contrary to logic, to respond in such a hostile, adversarial, and negative manner, to a *gift*.<br /><br />The lack of receptiveness to this, and to the entire prospect of gaining new knowledge, is striking.&nbsp; The three people who have responded (negatively) do not want to know more, they are apparently satisfied with what has been convenient for them, and they seem very threatened, in fact, by the prospect of something that challenges their preconceived notions, most particularly, it would seem, the one concerning whether or not they have, up to this point, been doing the *best* they could do with the arrangements they have made for their companion animals.<br /><br />One person has accused me of being &quot;condescending&quot; because I have provided information.&nbsp; She asserts that I have *assumed* that she is ignorant, uninformed, and incompetent - - yet, inherent and intrinsic to the very conversation that we are having - - about *kennel* boarding - - she *proves* that this is so.&nbsp; Otherwise, she would know, as my clients do, about in-home boarding, she would be boarding her dog with a competent home-board and not a kennel, and we wouldn&#039;t be having this conversation!<br /><br />She clearly has *not* done &quot;the best&quot; in researching her options, she has *not* done her &quot;homework&quot;, she does not like having this revealed to her, and considers the information I have provided a personal affront to her dignity (the hell with what&#039;s best for the dog, at this point!).<br /><br />This does not, however, discredit the information, nor should it disuade those inclined to take a more pro-active and successful approach to the introduction of new and better resources, from availing themselves of accomodations that might better facilitate their purposes (such as the gentleman who was concerned with doing business with someone who could be relied on in emergencies).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s fun to talk down to someone who knows more than you do, from the safe anonymous concealment of the internet - - but this is not productive; it will not be of any assistance to anyone, or their dogs.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, am *not* anonymous.&nbsp; I have put myself out here, and stand by the information I have given you, *by name*, and with traceable references.&nbsp; My qualifications, going back over thirty years, attest to my expertise in my field.&nbsp; It is then *curious* that anyone with less qualification would attempt to do anything but *learn*, and utilize that information that they have gotten from me to increase the efficiency of their performance, but would prefer, instead, to take meaningless pot-shots at me, by way of justifying their choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Oh - - you say you&#039;re doing everything *perfectly*, with *no* room for improvement?&nbsp; Gee - - wish I were *you*!).<br /><br /><strong>Before you reject something good that&#039;s offered to you, such as the information I am giving you - - ask yourself *WHY* you&#039;re doing that</strong>.&nbsp; (Just a little *behavioral* thing - - but as a behaviorist, I think we should all be more *aware* of our motivations).<br /><br />Here is one of the reasons why I prefer spending my time with dogs!&nbsp; They make more sense than many people do, and don&#039;t usually fight you when you&#039;re offering something nice.<br /><br />As long as Buddy (I believe it was) has quoted *Shakespeare*, perhaps I should cite a far more pertinent quotation, from the Bible; Matthew: 7:6<br /><br />&#039;Do not throw bread to dogs, or pearls to swine&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Stay tuned for Part 2.<br /><br />[/i]</div>

in researching her options, she has *not* done her &quot;homework&quot;, she does not like having this revealed to her, and considers the information I have provided a personal affront to her dignity (the hell with what&#039;s best for the dog, at this point!).<br /><br />This does not, however, discredit the information, nor should it disuade those inclined to take a more pro-active and successful approach to the introduction of new and better resources, from availing themselves of accomodations that might better facilitate their purposes (such as the gentleman who was concerned with doing business with someone who could be relied on in emergencies).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s fun to talk down to someone who knows more than you do, from the safe anonymous concealment of the internet - - but this is not productive; it will not be of any assistance to anyone, or their dogs.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, am *not* anonymous.&nbsp; I have put myself out here, and stand by the information I have given you, *by name*, and with traceable references.&nbsp; My qualifications, going back over thirty years, attest to my expertise in my field.&nbsp; It is then *curious* that anyone with less qualification would attempt to do anything but *learn*, and utilize that information that they have gotten from me to increase the efficiency of their performance, but would prefer, instead, to take meaningless pot-shots at me, by way of justifying their choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Oh - - you say you&#039;re doing everything *perfectly*, with *no* room for improvement?&nbsp; Gee - - wish I were *you*!).<br /><br /><strong>Before you reject something good that&#039;s offered to you, such as the information I am giving you - - ask yourself *WHY* you&#039;re doing that</strong>.&nbsp; (Just a little *behavioral* thing - - but as a behaviorist, I think we should all be more *aware* of our motivations).<br /><br />Here is one of the reasons why I prefer spending my time with dogs!&nbsp; They make more sense than many people do, and don&#039;t usually fight you when you&#039;re offering something nice.<br /><br />As long as Buddy (I believe it was) has quoted *Shakespeare*, perhaps I should cite a far more pertinent quotation, from the Bible; Matthew: 7:6<br /><br />&#039;Do not throw bread to dogs, or pearls to swine&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Stay tuned for Part 2.<br /><br />[/i]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;I LOVE A MYSTERY&#039; - - PART 2<br /><br />As I have been confronted with the assertion that I know &quot;nothing&quot; about a specific venue that has become the topic of this discussion, and I, in return, have accused some of you of not doing your &quot;homework&quot;, I felt it fair to do a little research on CBW; research that took me all of *five* minutes, to find the truth about the operation of this establishment (that you, too, can research for yourselves, in the same five minutes; you don&#039;t have to take my word for anything).<br /><br />The results of my five minutes of research were quite disturbing, but not uncommon.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take a look; shall we?&nbsp; (And I&#039;ll play this backward, just to keep it interesting, as a mystery should be).<br /><br />&quot;Camp Bow Wow - - North America&#039;s Premier Doggy-Day And Overnight Camp&quot;, is the header on the homepage of the Long Island City CBW website.&nbsp; And let&#039;s STOP RIGHT THERE for a moment, to examine this claim!<br /><br />WHO says this about them?&nbsp; Other than the *hype* that they, themselves, generate, WHO makes this claim about CBW?&nbsp; (And, by what criteria, in any case?!).&nbsp; *NO ONE*!&nbsp; NO ONE says this about them, other than themselves!&nbsp; There is *NO* ENDORSEMENT to back this spurious claim!&nbsp; *No* humane society, *no* animal-advocacy organization, *no*animal-oriented association, no animal-oriented publication!&nbsp; ABSOLUTELY NO ONE connected with anything that has anything to do with *animals*.<br /><br />They, further, say that they have been &quot;featured in newspapers, magazines, and on television shows&quot;, as &quot;a wonderful alternative to the traditional kennel&quot; (I, personally, fail to see the difference).&nbsp; BUT THEY DON&#039;T SAY *WHICH ONES*!!!&nbsp; *WHAT* newspapers?&nbsp; *WHAT* magazines?&nbsp; *WHAT* t.v. shows?&nbsp; Do you know how quick and eager commercial businesses are to cite specifics, in regard to such things, when they have something to tell, and names to drop?&nbsp; Holy cow!&nbsp; This is *why* businesses seek publicity - - so that they can promote themselves with it - - *specifically* and *by name*!!&nbsp; *WHY* would *this* business make such claims - - yet be so vague?&nbsp; The mystery deepens!&nbsp; Until you look into their &quot;PRESS&quot; section.&nbsp; But let&#039;s save that, for a moment; shall we?<br /><br />First, let&#039;s go back and look again at that home page, and what it advertises, which is contrary to one of the issues we&#039;ve been discussing:&nbsp; bloat.&nbsp; They say that they feature *&quot;ALL DAY PLAY&quot;*, and they show, in one photo shot, a small, inflatable, child&#039;s wading pool, filled with water.&nbsp; For all intents and purposes, that&#039;s some big, available water dish, probably loaded with bacteria, too, and BANG!&nbsp; Your &quot;bloat protocol&quot; is dead!&nbsp; The lecture and the handout on the subject?&nbsp; That&#039;s *their* liability disclaimer; demonstrably, it has no bearing on the true nature of the situation, or care of your dog.&nbsp; (Add a little something, here: Giardia.&nbsp; Small, common pools like these can be a hotbed of Giardia.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re not lucky, *you* and your dog can get to share something known as &quot;ping-pong Giardia&quot;!&nbsp; What fun!!).<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look into that &quot;Press&quot; section on that website, and see where those mentionable &quot;features&quot; have been.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve pointed out, there haven&#039;t been any endorsements from any sort of *dog* or *animal* associations; with all their elaborate internet *crap*, they fail to be endorsed by ONE valid source - - so what &quot;newspapers&quot;, &quot;magazines&quot;, and &quot;television shows&quot; are they talking about?<br /><br />And it&#039;s just *UNBELIEVABLE*!&nbsp; *ALL* of their &quot;press&quot; has been in *BUSINESS* publications!!!!!!!&nbsp; NOWHERE are they touted as animal-care specialists - - - but as *BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS*!&nbsp; <br /><br />They are referred to as a &quot;franchise SYSTEM&quot;; they&#039;re an &quot;industrial&quot; system, that boasts &quot;over 200 CBWs across the country!&nbsp; (All staffed by *incompetents*!!&nbsp; HOW do I know this?&nbsp; No one competent would work in a system like this!).&nbsp; <br /><br />All you see on their websites is the word &quot;BUSINESS&quot;, over and over again!&nbsp; *They&#039;re selling FRANCHISE BUSINESSES*; *that* is their primary interest, not dog care!&nbsp; That is what their websites are designed for.&nbsp; That is what their de facto businesses are designed for.&nbsp; They are a *pyramid* operation!&nbsp; (More on this, shortly).<br /><br />And it gets better.&nbsp; Curtis Moore, the guy behind this &quot;entrepreneurial business&quot; is a retired marketing strategy / entrepreneurship expert from Lucent, a giant technologies conglomerate.&nbsp; He worked there until 1996.&nbsp; He is assisted in his endeavors by his wife, who retired from MCI Technologies in the year 2000.&nbsp; NEITHER OF THESE PEOPLE WERE IN ANY PROFESSIONAL FIELD CONNECTED WITH ANIMAL OR DOG CARE, *EVER*.&nbsp; (Except for a summer, long ago, during which this character worked as a kennel-boy).&nbsp; HIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE IS NOT ANIMAL CARE, BUT BUSINESS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES.<br /><br />But that&#039;s not all.&nbsp; He has some very interesting side-line businesses, that may shed some light on the operations of CBW, as a corporate entity.&nbsp; *Brian, pay attention; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be thrilled!*<br /><br />If you follow the very clear and frank path (this guy isn&#039;t hiding anything; he relies on your ignorance; he&#039;s right in your face, and insulting your intelligence!) you will find that he is also running a *puppy mill*!&nbsp; That&#039;s right!&nbsp; He breeds poor specimens of lousy, probably unsound, dogs (Bichons [unrecognizable as Bichons, by the way; looking like Maltese!] and Corgis) that are not exhibited (shown) or tested for genetic disease.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t go to the trouble or *EXPENSE* of having good stock, or exhibiting his dogs, but he does charge the unaware and unwary &quot;show quality&quot; prices for them!&nbsp; AND, he boasts, on his website, that he uses *Diamond* dog food (the very first brand to poison so many dogs, with terrible ingredients from China!) - - *meaning* that *he doesn&#039;t even so much as pay to *feed* his puppy-mill dogs*; for that mention, he gets his feed without charge from the company that makes it!&nbsp; (I&#039;m liking this guy less and less!).<br /><br />But it&#039;s not over yet!!!&nbsp; Because our CBW developer has yet another sideline business he&#039;s been working on!&nbsp; He&#039;s cashing in on the craze for organic beef, by breeding &quot;organic&quot; Lowline Black Angus cattle, for consumption!!!&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; know what &quot;organic&quot; means, when you live in Texas, and you&#039;re raising cattle?&nbsp; It means that they live outdoors and eat grass, which grows for *free* in the great state of Texas, where there&#039;s hardly any winter, and the costs of such an operation amount to not much more than the cost of the land itself, yet have high yields in the marketplace!&nbsp; (While we&#039;re at it, for those who think &quot;green&quot;, raising cattle is one of the most exploitative, planet-violating things you can do!). <br /><br />So - - a pattern emerges:&nbsp; here we have someone (who specializes in *marketing strategy* and *entrepreneurial development*) who runs three separate businesses that all *EXPLOIT* animals, and makes his income at the *expense* of animals.&nbsp; And his crowning achievement, thus far, is CBW, cited and written up, for being a marvelous entrepreneurial pyramid-system franchise *industry*, that has generated &quot;over 200 locations across the country&quot;, since 1996, started with income from his puppy mill (the &quot;breeding program&quot; referred to in the warm, fuzzy story of how Moore turned certain aspects of his business over to his wife, when she retired, in 2000).&nbsp; <br /><br />Returning to the issue of Mr. Moore, and CBW&#039;s press, I would direct you to the coverage that they&#039;ve gotten on Merchant&#039;sCircle - - *not* &#039;DogCircle&#039;, or &#039;AnimalCircle&#039; - - *MERCHANT&#039;s*Circle.&nbsp; (It&#039;s always about business, never about dogs!).&nbsp; And there we have a videotape, from YouTube - - CBW&#039;s *advertisement*!&nbsp; As such, the *BEST* view of their business that they have to offer!&nbsp; Take a look at that, and I&#039;ll be back soon with my assessment of that video, and the final chapter (and it isn&#039;t good news). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
