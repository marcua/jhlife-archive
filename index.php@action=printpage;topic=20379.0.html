				This is a helpful map for anyone who would like to donate any food items. <br /><br />I think I may start baking and making sandwiches now ;)<br /><br />https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=14NZxVR2sk5Y14eTYRXqUNvk4xAW_yZV8&amp;ll=40.69985411275804%2C-73.8801301&amp;z=13

				&nbsp;Any ideas on what is the most popular stuff for the fridges? A few times I went there were some industrial sized items that I think were intimidating for people to take. And some unlabeled healthy looking breads but no really much. Sandwiches sound good but wonder if groceries are better for stretching into meals or the prepared meals are easier to use and more popular.

Thanks!

				CTown at 37th/86 has chicken legs (the leg/thigh big piece) for 59 cents a pound.<br />So a package of 4 or so of them is about $2 dollars. I&#039;m hoping to get some for the Northern Fridge. <br /><br />

				Since it&#039;s going to be a cold one for the next few days, I got five bowls of vegan sweet potato soup out of my pot. Sadly just five ;( will bring to elmhurst fridge, but on so dangerous to be close to Ayada and Spicy Shallot, two wonderful Thai restaurants ;)
