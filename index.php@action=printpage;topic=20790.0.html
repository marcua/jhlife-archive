				Title: <strong>The New JH Community Center and a Senior component?</strong><br />

				&nbsp;There is a dearth of activity and attention here in JH for seniors. We are way behind our neighbors even in other Queens communities and it would be great to change that in the coming community center. We have heard a lot about the cost of childcare but the cost of elder care is five times that amount! Many of NYC&#039;s vast network of senior centers are multi-tasking as nursery and after school centers too. One of the senior centers on Manhattan&#039;s East Side offers healthy farm-to-table style meals for a couple of dollars to their members along with many other programs, classes and services. What a great help for families!<br />&nbsp; JH needs a proper facility for its senior population now and for those eventually becoming seniors. See this NYTimes article about how someone in the US turns 65 every 8 seconds. Give the podcast on the excellent research by Ai Jen Poo and on Ezra Klein&#039;s podcast a listen today.<br />&nbsp;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ai-jen-poo.html

				YES we need to pay attention to our seniors. <br />Sometimes it seems their voice is weaker, and so not heard, over the screams of the kids. <br />Both are important, both make this community a home!

				&nbsp;Yes, we need young and old growing in our community. A forest will all the same age trees is vulnerable to extinction. Anecdotally, I notice many students writing essays about their interactions with older folks as a powerful experience in their lives. It&#039;s touching and nice to know it works both ways. Let&#039;s hope this new JH community center is an asset for all.
