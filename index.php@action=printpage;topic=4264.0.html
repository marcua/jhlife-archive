				I&#039;ve been. Had some kind of pulled pork and pineapple grilled sandwich. Its an experience, and quite a stylistic place, which is worth a visit overall. Be prepared to have your order screwed up a bit, and to wait a long time. You order and pick up at the counter, then find a seat. Loud, kind of clubby music, even when its empty. As for burgers, I wouldn&#039;t expect anything typical-and the ingredients are not the best. If you go thinking &#039;fast food&#039;, you might enjoy it.

				If you are looking for a really good burger the only one in the neighborhood is at Cassidy&#039;s Ale House on 75t and 31st near the Waldbaums shopping center
