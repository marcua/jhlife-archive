				Dear neighbors, <br /><br />This is just a general and discussion question. What do you most anticipated to see open in this neighborhood comes 2018? Could be small or big. What do you like to see opening? <br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br />Patrick

				I think we have done this discussion recently but I&#039;ll bite:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; A bookstore <br />2.&nbsp; A friendly and less regulated cafe<br />3. A grocery store that ups their game in terms of more varied selection, prepared foods (Mediterranean?),&nbsp; and no expired items. <br />4. A place to buy fresh fish

				Lalochezia--ha ha ha. I enjoyed your post. Especially the part about mediocre restaurants that offer the same cuisine we already have so much of. It&#039;s so disappointing. The new health food place is a great addition, from the sound of it. I already heavily patronize Just Made 4 You but would love an additional choice along those lines. Though I think the new place is vegetarian only, so that&#039;s limited. And isn&#039;t the bagel shop re-opening as a Greek restaurant? I have high hopes for that--my favorite kind of food and hard to find around here. Almost tempts me to move to Astoria. <br /><br />These conversations about what we want here in JH are just exercises in frustration. How would we get any of these fantastic things like a community center with a pool and indoor/outdoor playspace? We can&#039;t even get a for-profit health club chain with really good facilities/classes here. Who would fund such a community center? Sigh.

				Same things been wishing for the last 10+ years...a good place for brunch, a good burger (would take BareBurger--seems like they are everywhere else in Queens), and a good pizza place (wood burning oven quality pizza), not Sac&#039;s or Louie&#039;s which are fine for a slice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, a market with a good selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, and better mediterranean foods and prepared foods. The Downtown Organic market on 84th has been a great addition--along with the Farmer&#039;s Market, it often saves me from completely leaving the neighborhood for grocery shopping.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope 2018 brings some new choices for the neighborhood...

				I second everyone&#039;s push for the things that have been &quot;coming soon&quot; for what feels like eons (Swim Two Birds, Queensboro).<br /><br />And I second all the other things folks have been saying (nicer supermarket, brick oven pizza). But I think the thing that is sorely missed for me personally is a craft cocktail bar. I&#039;m no pro bartender myself, but I enjoy —&nbsp;and can make —&nbsp;a good craft cocktail. And I don&#039;t mean Bocaito. Nothing against them, but they&#039;re a restaurant first, and a bar second, which is apparent in the drinks.<br /><br />I would love nothing more than a small, 10-15 seat cocktail bar. I don&#039;t normally find myself in Brooklyn (I break out in hives), but I really enjoyed this teeny Clinton Hill bar —&nbsp;The Mayflower —&nbsp;which had like 3-4 tables and was kitty-corner to an associated restaurant (Aita). They didn&#039;t serve food. The space wasn&#039;t large. But it was perfect for grabbing a well-made drink with a friend or two. The small space and focused offering kept the drink costs low ($10).<br /><br />Honestly, if we hadn&#039;t just poured all our money into buying our place, a cocktail bar in JH would have been something my wife and I probably would have considered doing.

				I&#039;ve been here for more than a decade now, and I&#039;ve seen this same list of &quot;stuff upscale people want&quot; SO many times. And yes, Astoria gentrified, but ... has anyone seen different -conditions- in Jackson Heights that would lead to a change in the retail situation? Because using the difficulties the Queensboro and STB have had as bellwethers, I&#039;m pretty sure the kinds of businesses you folks are seeking are going to stay the heck out of here.<br /><br />SO MANY TIMES I have seen this list. So. Many. Times.<br /><br />Let me add that as I see people moving into my building, they are not upscale English-speaking people who want what you want - they are FOB immigrants who shop at the dollar store, and that&#039;s great. It&#039;s great that in this over expensive city, there are still some decent neighborhoods where new immigrants can chase the dream and raise their kids. That&#039;s what JH has been about for decades. It&#039;s the neighborhood I moved to. But our upscale population is going to support E77, slightly Lockwood, not Pauglina, and apparently nothing else catering to it, and that&#039;s OK.

				Hey, I kinda agree with THEPLANESLAND.<br /><br />The historic district of Jackson Heights is gentrified.&nbsp; But that&#039;s only maybe only 25% of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The other 75% is immigrant communities.<br /><br />(And that&#039;s what makes the neighborhood real)<br /><br />And business is simply a matter of numbers and no more complicated than that.<br /><br />So either a business caters to a 25,000 market&nbsp; or a 75,000 market.

				Theplanesland--please explain exactly how the presence of the immigrant population in JH has directly led to the difficulties of the Queensboro and Swim Two Birds? What is the connection? And how, to take a recent example, is a shop like the new Fresh Spilt Milk able to open up in a reasonable time frame? Fresh Spilt Milk takes the health food orientation of Just Made 4 U (which I love) to a new and higher level for the neighborhood, and is very much an upscale, Park Slope-type of shop in its offerings (not talking about price points, which I haven&#039;t assessed). I think it will be very successful here, as Just Made 4 U seems to be--and the latter attracts many customers who are not English-speaking Caucasians, by the way. Also, I&#039;ve noticed that many of the South American-type restaurants in JH are quite expensive and seem to be going strong. How can that be if JH is made up of mostly low-income immigrants and thus cannot support more upscale shops and restaurants? That&#039;s too simplistic.

They know they can find the nice Colombian food in Jackson Heights, so they come to Jackson Heights for the nice Colombian food, which is great.

				The planesland--your logic is faulty. QED??? You have not demonstrated the relationship between QB and STB not opening for years and the demographics of the neighborhood. You can state that demographics explain the problem--but that&#039;s just a statement of opinion with no backup to persuade me that it&#039;s accurate. It&#039;s your assumption. I happen to think you are wrong. Maybe it&#039;s issues with particular landlords, issues with particular city regulations, issues with the owners&#039; particular finances or business abilities. How does the inability of a business to make it to opening relate to what you suppose would be the lack of interested or financially flush customers should these businesses actually open. Just doesn&#039;t make sense. You probably would have stated that no way, no how would anyone pay a million dollars for a house or coop in JH. But it&#039;s happening.

				To be honest, in terms of dining and all that, I&#039;d rather this neighborhood remain ethnic and be a destination for these cuisines. I don&#039;t see why new American/Italian can&#039;t also be a destination that people travel out of the neighborhood for rather than a de facto neighborhood spot for people.<br /><br />There are already plenty of neighborhoods that are gentrified with boring food. I could even see an argument for some of that type of businesses in a place like LIC where the neighborhood was pretty barren with no distinct character like 10 years ago and didn&#039;t have much character and you&#039;re starting from scratch but there&#039;s already a robust culture with various businesses. It&#039;s not much different from people moving into Chinatown proper to open up a dive bar because now it has some ironic hipster cachet. It doesn&#039;t fit and it threatens the neighborhood when landlords hold out for that kind of business and end up displacing the kind of people who would open up businesses consistent with the original neighborhood.&nbsp; <br />

				Well, another issue that matters to me, at least, is that some people for health reasons need to adhere to diets that are not highly spicy, not rice-and-noodle based, and do not feature cream-and-butter-rich sauces. For people like me and my family, there is a limited supply of dining spots where you can have a meal that fits within your dietary restrictions. And beyond people with, say, diabetes or digestive issues, there are lots of people who should be limiting their intake of saturated fats and carbs. Mediterranean cuisine is great for that--lots of grilled meats and fish, sauteed vegetables, and salads without heavy sauces or seasoning.

				Jeanette--you are so right re: backlash. It&#039;s somehow an insult to various groups if you don&#039;t like or can&#039;t digest this or that type of food. By that logic, if you are a vegetarian you are de facto insulting meat-eaters, and since there are more carnivores in the neighborhood than vegetarians, you should just go someplace else to get your precious vegetable dishes and stop requesting that they be available nearby. <br /><br />Personally, I moved to JH six years ago, ran around eating at all the restaurants (including Lety&#039;s), and quickly gained 10-plus pounds.&nbsp; Now I have lost the weight, developed a more delicate digestive system, and have to mostly avoid all the Thai, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, etc, places. And am left with the diners, which I find not terribly good, or the South American, heavy meat- and-potatoes type places--and I hardly ever eat meat. I order from Just Made 4 U whenever I order, which is often. Would just like a few alternatives, ideally places I would enjoy dining out at.

				I referred to &quot;upscale&quot; because these wishes are often characterized that way--as the things that more affluent people want. I don&#039;t think juice bars are especially upscale, and in fact we do have them here and they are popular with people from all walks of life, I observe, not just what used to be called &quot;yuppies.&quot; I disagree with the commenter who says all cuisines have healthy options. Some are very much not healthy for people who need to avoid certain ingredients. I have sometimes asked for &quot;no spice&quot; or &quot;very little spice&quot; and gotten a very spicy dish. This probably goes under the same heading as the commenters who are saying &quot;If you don&#039;t like what we have in JH, don&#039;t live here,&quot; ie, &quot;If you don&#039;t want spicy food, don&#039;t eat here at Thakali Kitchen.&quot; Hence, the issue I have with the lack of options.

				I second everything that Jeanette says so well. And that is the only point I am making: there is no reason why we cannot have more diversity in our retail offerings, and I just don&#039;t believe the people who say what is here and already successful here is the only thing that can be successful here, &quot;the market has spoken,&quot; etc. It&#039;s a lot more complicated than the notion that we get what we want or deserve or are entitled to because of the laws of the market, or supply and demand. I second the observation that places like Cannelle and Downtown Market—which might be considered by the naysayers here as unwelcome, non-JH-type businesses—are very successful and popular with customers of all nationalities.

				I&#039;m like ... 25% trolling here, admittedly, but there&#039;s another underlying issue I want to bring up.<br /><br />In 100% of the cases so far, these kinds of businesses have been bellwethers for massively higher residential rents and driving out working-class immigrant residents. I lived through the beginning of the process in Astoria. And I came to Jackson Heights in part because I wanted to be in a neighborhood with a lot of income and ethnic diversity. So I think the resistance, from a lot of us, comes from that relentless history of &quot;the wine bar shows up, and a few years later you wake up and everything&#039;s wine bars,&quot; like we&#039;ve seen on 30th Avenue in Astoria. Wine bars, or Whole Foodses, seem to be like Pringles - if you open the can, nobody can stop at just one.

				I&#039;d raise Sunnyside for the sake of comparison, rather than Astoria which is the one always raised. The rents in Sunnyside are only a little higher than in Jackson Heights (which is probably due to the closer to Manhattan location) and are a good bit lower than Astoria. (For instance, if you search 1 bedrooms in Sunnyside, Jackson Heights and Astoria on Streeteasy and sort by most expensive, the first three pages are all Astoria.)&nbsp; And I think coop sales prices are a good bit higher in Jackson Heights than Sunnyside. <br /><br />But Sunnyside has a small collection of wine bars, Neapolitan pizza, gastropubs (and the thing I pine for most -- Parrot Coffee). Perhaps we are just in the bellwether phase there, but I wouldn&#039;t be so sure. I don&#039;t think there is a single process &quot;gentrification&quot; that operates as a tidal wave everywhere once you let the first drip drip drip in. There are multiple dynamics and actors involved. To me Sunnyside feels like it&#039;s achieved a stable balance of different kinds of businesses along with income and ethnocultural diversity.&nbsp; And I&#039;d like to see Jackson Heights move a little in the Sunnyside direction. <br /><br />

				Regarding the charge that wide-appeal retail (bistros and wine bars) drives up rents, can someone explain why a studio on 88th Street would cost $850/mo, and ten years later $1500/mo (I&#039;m estimating, basing this on r/e ads), when nothing of that sort has opened. Meanwhile, the area is and has been completely saturated with ethnic stores and restaurants.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rising housing costs cannot be honestly linked to wide-appeal* retail in the vicinity. <br /><br />*Parrot sells Black Sea products and is technically ethnic.
