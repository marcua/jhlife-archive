				Hi All-<br />I hope this message finds you well. There is a yoga class tonight (and every Monday night) at MKD School of Karate at 7:00pm. For the remaining month of September the focus will be acquainting ourselves with the basics of breath, movement, and relaxation. The intention is to give our busy minds a rest while we practice feeling more at home and present in our bodies. &quot;We begin where we are and how we are, and whatever happens, happens.&quot;- T.K.V Desikachar<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you at class. If you have any questions, please contact me.<br />Warmly,<br />Abigail<br /><br /><br />Live In Vision Yoga, or LIV Yoga is a modern interpretation of Yoga that appeals to students who want a dynamic, creative approach to navigating the body, mind, and spirit.<br /><br />Students are educated about their body and mind as they deepen their practice and become better acquainted with their self. The environment of the class is supportive and encouraging. Students feel safe and respected and have the freedom to experiment in a non-competitive space.<br /><br />Abigail acknowledges the uniqueness of each body and encourages students to do their best while trusting themselves and their bodies. Practice is about oneâ€™s state of being.<br /><br />Her classes focus on helping students to practice with self awareness and proper alignment so that students develop a sense of strength, stability, ease and confidence. She is very dedicated to a holistic approach to well-being. Her vision is for her classes to serve as a valuable tool for improving quality of life, both in the studio and out. http://www.mkdkarate.com/yoga.html<br /><br />WHEN: Every Monday @ 7:00-8:00 PM<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Classes begin and end on time.<br />WHERE: MKD School of Karate, 72-26 Roosevelt Ave, 2nd Flr, Jackson Heights NY 11372<br />DETAILS: $10 per class<br />All levels and both genders most welcome!<br />The floor is matted. We recommend however that you bring your own mat. We have clean towels at your disposal, at no fee
