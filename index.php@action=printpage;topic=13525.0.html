				Dear Jackson Heights Friends and Neighbors.<br />We excited to announce that Espresso 77 will soon be renovated and will be expanding into the adjacent retail space!<br />Most importantly, this will mean more seating (hurray!), but it also gives us a chance to freshen up the storefront, add new items to our menu (draft beer, anyone?), and upgrade our air-conditioning and sound systems.<br /><br /><strong>NOW - WE NEED YOUR HELP!</strong><br />We have been saving our pennies in hopes that this opportunity would finally come our way, but we need a bigger budget to make it terrific.&nbsp; We have set up an IndieGogo fundraising site <strong>(http://igg.me/at/espresso77/x/5521115 (http://igg.me/at/espresso77/x/5521115)), </strong>and we are asking for the financial support of our friends, neighbors and customers to help out with the work.&nbsp; We&#039;ve set up some great perks to show our appreciation - t-shirts, parties, free coffee - most of all, know that with your help, we are going to invest in the life of our community for years to come.<br /><br />Thank you for the past 8 years and we look forward for many more years of coffee, art and music!<br />Afzal and Julie<br />

				Link: http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/espresso-77-is-expanding-in-jackson-heights/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/espresso-77-is-expanding-in-jackson-heights/)<br /><br />Neighborhood gem, Espresso 77, recently announced expansion plans of their Jackson Heights location after securing the lease of the retail space directly next door. The expansion will provide more seating inside, more benches outside, an improved air conditioning system, draft beer, food delivery, a larger restroom, more selections of food and drink and a new storefront system.<br /><br />As part of their expansion effort E77 has also taken to IndieGoGo to fundraise for the expansion. If you’d like to join the fundraising effort please visit https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/espresso-77-jackson-heights-store-expansion#/story (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/espresso-77-jackson-heights-store-expansion#/story) . Please also consider sharing the link to aid in the worthwhile effort!<br /><br />I for one am looking forward to the new and improved Espresso 77!

				Sounds great E77 team!&nbsp; Looking forward to the expansion.<br /><br />I have a funded many campaigns and charities over the years, but I usually do it at the $10-25 level. <br /><br />I was thinking after looking at your donation page that maybe it would be advantageous to come up with some form of perk for your $35 level, like a free beverage of your choice. Also, it might be beneficial to create another tier at say the $15 or $20 level, where it could be buy one drink you get one free.<br /><br />Best of luck!!

				&nbsp;Here&#039;s another idea I&#039;ve used in the past to help raise money. Create a compilation CD involving the bands that perform at espresso 77. It&#039;s good publicity&nbsp; for them, and the sales can go directly towards your renovations.

				I don’t find it strange. I actually find it quite nice. Espresso 77 has enriched and strengthened Jackson Heights. They are an integral part of the community, and many of us who live here and have reaped the benefits of their cafe would like to show our appreciation and solidarity with their vision by helping them expand. It’s as if we’re members of an extended family who believe that helping each other strengthens the entire family.

				Pynchoff: Patel&#039;s is a large chain with locations all over the US. E77 is a real mom-and-pop. Silly comparison. I agree with jtjh. Why not contribute to help expand a business many have wanted to see expand? A business that has a unique value to the neighborhood.

				While I&#039;m delighted Espresso 77 is expanding, I&#039;m not willing to donate for this purpose, and in my view they should offer either a share of the profits or a commensurate amount of food/drink. I&#039;m happy to donate for feeding the hungry, for fighting disease, for supporting nonprofit cultural institutions. But I have a small business of sorts, and it&#039;s hard to see why I should donate to theirs when they aren&#039;t donating to mine. They produce positive externalities, but so do I. And this isn&#039;t about rescuing a beloved business that is failing; on the contrary, they have a second outlet, in Park Slope no less, and by expanding they&#039;ll have a chance to increase their profits in JH. I wish them every success at this, and I look forward to spending money in their expanded digs. But the case for donating seems to me extremely weak.

I don&#039;t know for certain, but I imagine that Espresso 77 is a profitable business and a successful expansion would increase their profit. This isn&#039;t really like The Shop Around the Corner fighting Fox Books. I understand that JH is a tight-knit community and I really enjoy that, but I find that with this type of crowd sourcing the kumbaya mentality only travels in 1 direction. Espresso 77 should invest in the people of the community as much as they expect us to invest in them. If they are asking for money when they don&#039;t have it, contributions should be seen as actual investments with actual returns, regardless of how small they are.&nbsp;

				I guess it&#039;s no different than a band or artist asking to help you fund their CD/Tour/project.&nbsp; It seems in today&#039;s climate, this is a common way for people to seek extra funds.&nbsp; If you believe in the cause, great, if not, or are not in a financial situation to, then you don&#039;t have to.&nbsp; To me I think it&#039;s important for the enterprise to come up with creative &#039;perks&#039; to inspire people to give.&nbsp; It seems in this case E77 has done that.&nbsp; <br /><br />My big concern is that with Cafe Bene entering the JH coffeehouse market (and with both businesses located on 37th), E77 might feel a bit of a squeeze.&nbsp; So let&#039;s think, what does E77 have that Bene and Starbucks don&#039;t....oh yeah, beer and wine!!<br /><br />If I were E77 I would shift their efforts more in that direction.&nbsp; Especially considering our neighborhood is sorely lacking in that department. Some kegs of local beers (did you know there are now 5 microbreweries in Queens?) and specialty wines (maybe a unique collaboration with Table Wine) could provide the neighborhood with a special place that would feel quaint and local, and be sustainable.&nbsp;

				I hear you rasert.&nbsp; &nbsp;And truth is, for me as a musician, I&#039;ve never been fully comfortable with the idea of crowdfunding.&nbsp; &nbsp;But once I saw artists starting to use it creatively and as a way for friends and fans to pre-buy albums, it started to make more sense for me.&nbsp; Like having perks where $10 gets you an album, $20 gets you an album plus signed poster, $50 gets you an album, poster, plus VIP show, etc...&nbsp; Then it becomes and I&#039;ll scratch your back you scratch mine sort of thing. An opportunity for the fans to connect with the band and for the band to further their art through extra financial backing. <br /><br />It was for this reason I posted earlier on this thread for E77 to consider adding perks at a lower price point.&nbsp; This way it might feel less like you are backing them financially and more like you are being rewarded through customer loyalty through perks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like $10 gets you a free coffee beverage of your choice,&nbsp; $20 gets you coffee and an entrée of your choice. $35 gets you the same but Throw in a T-shirt, etc.&nbsp; Them it becomes more like what you said as far as you are basically pre-ordering. Showing business loyalty, if you will.<br /><br />

				Truth is, we don&#039;t know what financial avenues they have or have not explored, or have maxed out. If they say they need help, then I&#039;ll take them at their word. Maybe, between the Jackson Heights store, the Park Slope store which they acquired a couple years ago (isn&#039;t it nice to see something from Jackson Heights exported TO Park slope?), and the opportunity to acquire the adjacent store (which I know they have wanted to do for a very long time arose and they took it) and after exploring other, more traditional funding avenues they realized that in order to do it right it will require extra funding. Hence the request for help.<br /><br />What I am glad about is that they jumped at the opportunity so that it did not become another cell phone store and one of my fav businesses in the hood is going to get even better.<br /><br />Maybe the solution for them is to create another funding campaign with a revised perk system.&nbsp; One that benefits their business while also making those who donate feel special.&nbsp; &nbsp; I might suggest for a $50 donation you are invited to a private VIP party&nbsp; at the newly reopened E77 featuring open bar, hors d&#039;oeuvres, and a DJ. I know I would consider contributing to that one!

				I&#039;m looking forward to the expansion of Espresso 77, but most of all, I think it&#039;s great that this little cafe is situated right here in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Whether or not one contributes to their expansion campaign is really a matter of choice.&nbsp; Since the cafe&#039;s opening, Julie and Afzal have maintained a positive presence in the community, and I&#039;m sure that with their shop&#039;s growth, they will continue to bring good things to us...&nbsp; live music, art shows, an expanded menu, and more.&nbsp; I wish them well in their endeavors!<br /><br />

				When their request for funds was initially made, I was as put off as many of the posters on this thread for all of the same reasons.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I thought more about it, I decided to give them a few bucks. They have been generous to me as a local artist (showing my work and lowering their commission on sales without my asking) and creating an environment in the neighborhood of which I wish we had more.<br /><br />I wanted to put my money where my mouth is.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to sit by and grouse about pharmacies, cell phone stores, banks and the like, and not help where I could.&nbsp; I came to think that while their profit may be financial, my profit is environmental and worth my little&nbsp; &quot;investment&quot;.<br />

				I don&#039;t see any reason why a business in good standing shouldn&#039;t reach out to their neighborhood for support, especially one that is as appreciated as E77 seems to be.&nbsp; How many businesses have you guys seen over your life dry up and move away or close down completely.&nbsp; Internet crowdfunding allows you to help build and support the things that you want in your neighborhood.&nbsp; Why is that a bad thing, just because it&#039;s a &quot;private&quot; business.&nbsp; Do you want the Starbucks around the corner to be the only place you can get coffee and a sit-down experience?

				Espresso 77 has nothing to lose, really. Chances are they&#039;ll raise a decent amount of money they normally would never get their hands on, and with zero risk. Even if a few people got annoyed, it&#039;s not serious enough of an issue that they&#039;d boycott. It&#039;s a coffee shop, for Christ&#039;s sake. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think Caffe Bene will hurt Espresso 77. I think it&#039;ll have a greater negative effect on Starbucks. Starbucks is essentially kind pointless now, as it&#039;s a homeless man&#039;s version of Caffe Bene.

				I don&#039;t see a problem. They are free to ask and you are free to give or not. Some people like to think of neighborhoods as a community, like an extended family. Many people seem to like this shop. Like you might ask your mom some cash, they are asking. You don&#039;t have to give and don&#039;t have to be mad at them. I wouldn&#039;t say on thia list something I wouldn&#039;t say to their face. Don&#039;t forget, words hurt and these are real people who many here like. I don&#039;t even really go there, am not donating, but wish them well and respect their work.

				Espresso 77 says that the funds raised will pay for renovation of the exterior of the new storefront.&nbsp; The old medical office was a bit of an eyesore, so I think they have made a great choice by reinvest the community&#039;s donations back into neighborhood improvements.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Everyone has a right to heckle, but Espresso 77 is one of the most community-minded businesses we have here in Jackson Heights, and enjoys tremendous good will from the neighborhood.&nbsp; Over 150 people saw fit to donate in response to their request.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait for the new expanded shop!
