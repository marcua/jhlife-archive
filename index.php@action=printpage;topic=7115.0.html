				<br />A 1930s-era movie theater in Jackson Heights that became a porn palace before showing Bollywood flicks is about to experience its most radical reincarnation.<br /><br />A large South Asian grocery store and food court is slated to open this spring in the gutted shell of the Eagle Theater in the heart of Queensâ€™ Little India.<br /><br />But owners of the new Jackson Heights Bazaar â€” who launched the project before a controversial pedestrian plaza was installed on 37th Rd. and 74th St. â€” said the plaza could torpedo their best laid plans.<br /><br />â€œIn this neighborhood, if you open any Indian store youâ€™re guaranteed to make money,â€ said Razi Ahmed, one of the owners of the Bazaar. â€œBut not anymore.â€<br /><br />And local leaders are unhappy for another reason, saying the last thing the congested community needs is another supermarket.<br /><br />Ahmed and other South Asian business owners are lobbying the city remove the car-free plaza, which was installed last fall.<br /><br />They claim it has interrupted the flow of traffic and made it hard for shoppers to find parking.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s in the wrong place at the wrong time,â€ said Shiv Dass, president of the Jackson Heights Indian Merchants Association. â€œIt has just become a place for homeless people, drunk people.â€<br /><br />City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) defended the award-winning plaza.<br /><br />â€œIt gives the community open space in which they can meet, discuss issues and concerns and network with each other in a relaxed atmosphere,â€ he said.<br /><br />Efforts were made to work with the disgruntled merchants, he said, by reinstating some parking on 37th Rd. lost to bike lanes. There is also a proposal before Community Board 3 to change the direction of the road to feed into the business district.<br /><br />But Dromm expressed concerns over the â€œamount of trafficâ€ the Bazaar is expected to generate.<br /><br />â€œThe area is already overwhelmingly congested and I just donâ€™t see how it can sustain another supermarket,â€ he said.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas, the author of â€œJackson Heights â€” A Garden in the City,â€ also bemoaned the loss of the historic, art-deco theater for a grocery store.<br /><br />The Eagle was shuttered in 2009 due to a lethal combination of a Bollywood strike in India and a high rent increase, the Daily News previously reported.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s unfortunate that the interior was demolished,â€ said Karatzas, who would have preferred to have seen the theater preserved. But the loss of movie houses has â€œhappened all over the city<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/eagle-theater-south-asian-grocery-store-food-court-article-1.1021804#ixzz1mNyFnXP0

				Well it&#039;s nice to see that the merchants association is suddenly concerned about quality of life issues in and around the neighborhood! <em>What welcome news indeed!</em> Perhaps Mr. Dass has some proposals about easing pedestrian flow along crowded sidewalks where merchants illegally display all their goods? Or about all the smelly garbage left on the sidewalks that attract pigeons and rats? Or ways to get their customers to obey traffic laws when they drive into our neighborhood so they don&#039;t double-park or make illegal U-turns on 37th Avenue??

				I think Mr. Dass&#039; main concern is making money. Preserving landmarks and quality of life issues don&#039;t seem to be on his mind.&nbsp; I wonder if it occured to the Merchants Association to learn what makes from other pedestrian plazas in NYC (and other places)&nbsp; successful and then perhaps take some steps on their own?&nbsp; I haven&#039;t heard anything to that effect. Doesn&#039;t seem to be a priority.

Yes, having another market in an already saturated community is the last thing we need.This plaza finally represents something which is sorely needed by our community. Namely, more green space void of noise, garbage and traffic. If the Eagle is to reopen it should do so as a community performance space, not another market. I think it is outrageous to see how our community is abused and destroyed by those who dont even reside here.

				Back when the Eagle first closed there was a lot of talk about using the space for a community center or cultural hub.<br /><br />The problem is that no non-profit had/has the money for this.

				personally? i cannot imagine why the neighborhood needs another food market, particularly as a brand new one opened up right around the corner just weeks ago (and a good one at that -- clean, 24 hours, yay).<br /><br />that said, i know this is an unpopular opinion, but we live in free-market america, not the peoples republic of jackson heights. <br /><br />south asian markets that open are immediately swamped with paying customers. same with jewelers. same with what some like to call &#039;hoochie&#039; clothes stores.<br /><br />perhaps that indicates the neighborhood can actually support these businesses in the numbers we currently have?<br />&nbsp;<br />if people didn&#039;t want all this, these places would not open (which might explain our dearth of german-chilean fusion cafes). <br /><br />if anyone here is willing to put 300K or so of their own cash on the line to test the waters for a bistro, a baby photo studio, a designer kitchen franchise, bless you. i would probably patronize ... well, the first.<br /><br />shall we?

				It could be much better obviously, but for now the plaza seems fine to me, even as is, and I go through there regularly. It is a vast improvement compared to what was there before, and the efforts to keep it clean are working very well.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good idea that would be fabulous for all concerned eventually.&nbsp; When it has been even slightly warm, I&#039;ve seen people sitting at the tables, day and night.&nbsp; &nbsp;I completely disagree with the comment in the article that it just draws &quot;homeless people&quot; and drunks.<br /><br />As far as the new large South Asian market going into the old Eagle space, the issue is that the owner says in this and other articles that he expects that the neighborhood <em>can&#039;t</em> support his business apparently, and that he needs, and is counting on, cars coming from out of town to support it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know if the Shiv Dass quoted in the article is the same one who is listed as Co-Chair of the Business &amp; Economic Development Committee on Community Board 3&#039;s website?

				If they keep and spruce up the pedestrian plaza - even extending it to the entire 37th Rd., and someone has the wherewithal and vision to open a coffee shop/bakery there, (with <strong>nice</strong> pastries and breads, not crap we have too much of already in the &#039;hood), I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;ll clean up.&nbsp; People would be happy to sit outside reading the newspaper or just chatting while sipping coffee and enjoying a light bite.<br /><br />The local merchants should stop grousing and let something creative happen in their midst.&nbsp; If they had a clue, they would not have allowed the area to be so filthy all the time.&nbsp; In the end, they will all benefit and wish they hadn&#039;t been so negative about the changes.<br />

				It&#039;s funny to even think of the amount of traffic that a supermarket would make especially if the customers come in part from outside the neighborhood. Oddly<br />enough it&#039;s the change in traffic patterns with buses that makes this even remotely possible, though a really bad idea, for 37th road and the Plaza. As soon as<br />really warm weather comes and some events are planned the Plaza, my prediction is that it will become a performing asset for the neighborhood, literally and figuratively. Sorry also about the Eagle&#039;s demise as with so many other theaters in the area.

				There&#039;s actually video on a NY1 piece of shop owners closing their stores when local residents went to 37th Road to support them and learn more about their businesses. If the owners of those shops were interested in local business why would they shut out local shoppers like that&nbsp; ?&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems that the major thrust for the business owners is drawing traffic from the tri-state area to JH. They don&#039;t seem to realize the impact this has on streets that were never intended to handle that capacity, in fact at times they don&#039;t seem to realize that there&#039;s a neighborhood around them. They appear to be worried about their own bottom lines without concern for others around them.

				dssjh,<br /><br />I may have a different perception of&nbsp; what &quot;racism&quot;&nbsp; is since I spent most of my life in Asian countries where societies are not culturally mixed as much as here,<br /><br />I don&#039;t see which part of my post is racist.<br /><br />Accusing people for making public space filthy is racist?<br />Complaining about traffic congestion caused by business is racist?<br /><br />In local news show, there are segments where the viewers post their complaining toward some store or specific area in the community and the TV stations don&#039;t seem to think that is racist, either..

				it&#039;s a pervasive tone, koku.<br /><br />not one post in particular, but an overall worldview you&#039;ve espoused here going back months -- coy references, subtle digs, all of which play up the &#039;us versus them&#039; thing.<br /><br />and thanks for doing exactly what i said you&#039;d do.

				i don&#039;t believe you are correct in your assertion, Koku.<br /><br />and i don&#039;t think there&#039;s any debating the racism inherent in a line like<br /><br />&quot;I&nbsp; guess everyone knows why that street is so filthy but can&#039;t point the reason out for the solution because someone would say it is politically incorrect.&quot;<br /><br />that was delivered with utmost clarity....and i believe all of your statements on such topics have been clear. crystal clear.

				Can we instead discuss why the merchants are so dismissive of the local community and focused on shoppers coming in cars from the &quot;tri-state area,&quot; and how to change that attitude?

				I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights for over 20 years now and have to say that I&#039;ve never once shopped on 37Th road or on 73rd street for that matter. I often walk these streets to the train but have found them to be filthy and wouldn&#039;t want to spend any amount of time there. &nbsp;While I am sure that many residents of Jackson Heights do shop there, it is clear that the majority of people come from out of town as evidence by the insurmountable traffic &nbsp;and resulting noise and pollution. The plaza, although not at its full potential, &nbsp;is an incredible improvement from the cacophony that existed before. That&#039;s why they changed the traffic pattern. Its to benefit the people who live here. I feel like I can breathe when I walk up the block now. It would be great to get something to eat and sit at a table under a tree or two. &nbsp;I hope that Daniel Dromm is able to retain this space for the community and make it green. It would be great for people coming into the neighborhood as well. I would think it is the responsibility of the community board and our councilman to do what&#039;s right for the &quot;residents&quot; of the community....to improve the quality of life &nbsp;here. It follows then that it would be a good place to do business.

				&nbsp;Francis, I agree with you on this. The area has been unwelcoming for many years. The guy sitting at the top of the steps on the 37th Road subway entrance<br />has been there forever. Don&#039;t see as many drunks as before even. But the fact that parking has become any kind of issue for these businesses is reflective<br />of how little interest there is in cultivating local customers. Besides this being an insult to the local community, there is an antagonism about making the<br />area better for all. This seems counterproductive to good business practices. Who wants to eat in a restaurant that is not visibly clean? Sidewalk and tree<br />pits included. Or walk down the street even when it&#039;s so dense and people don&#039;t let others get past. <br />&nbsp;I can&#039;t wait for spring and the redesign of the Plaza which should make this area a gem (if all goes well) and a source of pride rather than embarrassment for local residents. I would like for more harmonious relationships between all of the diverse groups in Jackson Heights and think this is a fine opportunity to<br />reset the situation. My dream would be health conscious Indian food with lower fat and lot&#039;s of vegetables. I believe this business would do really well here<br />as a sort of nouvelle indian healthy restaurant but for everyday customers.<br />
