				&nbsp;I guess this explains why the protest wasn&#039;t locally based. I don&#039;t see these particular groups<br />represented much here in JH except Queens Neighborhoods United. I imagine they are all <br />doing some good work but are in different wider circles than what the locals here know about.

				The organizers of these types of events only have so many hours in a day to actually organize their events and take action to inform locals about the actions. Best to follow these groups online and figure out how they are letting their followers know about the efforts. I get that a lot of folks don&#039;t want their FB feed filled up with this sort of stuff (or have abandoned FB altogether), and ditto for email, but there&#039;s only so much organizers can realistically do to inform people about things like marches.
