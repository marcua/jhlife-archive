				I checked out the website and here is my confusion:&nbsp; the deal is $25 for lunch and $35 for dinner - but at Jackson Diner, for example, I can get out of there on buffet days for far less than that - not so much of a deal!&nbsp; Maybe at Tournesol, though...

				I&#039;ve done Queens Restaurant Week before (we went to Tournesol)... it&#039;s a 3 course meal and generally pretty nice, though I would totally recommend choosing places that are more on the expensive side so that you don&#039;t run into the conundrum of being able to eat there normally for less! That holds true even for Manhattan&#039;s restaurant week.

				I started to write about it on my site, but while writing, I couldn&#039;t remember the last time I&#039;ve spent $25+ PP on a meal in Queens. Maybe you can at some of the steak houses, but that&#039;s even a stretch.<br /><br />There arent that many restaurants on the list too. <br /><br />We should have a 10 dollar restaurant week. 25 is just too much for here. I havent heard that great things about tournesol (i think its the only french on the list), so I really don&#039;t care that much so far. <br /><br />Does anyone have any recommendations?

				The only place on that list that would be worth it is Water&#039;s Edge, where the direct view of the Manhattan skyline at night with the river at your feet is probably worth 10 bucks alone.&nbsp; I went here for Restaurant Week when it was happening on the Manhattan side (I give em props for getting into both!) and the appetizer and fish entree were delicious.&nbsp; The dessert was ok.&nbsp; The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner.
