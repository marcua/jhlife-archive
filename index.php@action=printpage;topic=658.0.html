				I got this email from a friend, and wanted to pass the word:<br />________________________________________________<br /><br />I would hope by this point that everyone knows that bedbugs are a true epidemic in this city and elsewhere.&nbsp; The most important way to reduce their spread is through education and early action.&nbsp; NYC does not seem to understand this very well, as education about bedbugs is not a priority.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#039;s the fact that they don&#039;t carry communicable diseases, or perhaps it&#039;s that NYC doesn&#039;t want to hurt its very lucrative tourist industry by admitting that our city has a problem with infestation (as all major cities do).<br /><br />And clearly it&#039;s not a pleasant subject and no one wants to be associated with these things.&nbsp; This produces a code of silence.<br /><br />So, please take a moment to educate yourselves on bedbugs.<br /><br /><strong>This is not intended to be alarmist, but did you know you could have bedbugs even though you don&#039;t show any signs of bites? </strong>&nbsp; Some estimate that 50% of people are not allergic to the bites.<br /><br />You can learn how to do a regular visual inspection of your home.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a good video (http://www.cbc.ca/mrl3/8752/marketplace/bed_eggs.wmv) though long at 15 minutes. If you don&#039;t want to watch the whole thing, at least read this article on how to check a hotel room for bedbugs (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11877871/)<br />The same info can be applied to checking your own home.&nbsp; <br /><br />And unfortunately the bugs are not just in hotels, but also have been found on public transportation, in hospitals, movie theatres, rental cars, schools, etc. So it&#039;s important to stay vigilant about inspecting your home on a regular basis and to stop any behavior like &quot;rescuing&quot; cast-off furniture from the trash.<br /><br />Knowledge is power! The best site for solid information is www.bedbugger.com<br />

				Please report them to your landlord and make sure proper extermination is done.&nbsp; NYC landlords are required to exterminate.&nbsp; If the landlord refuses or the problem is not eradicated, then you can report it to 311.<br /><br />Bugs travelling within buildings is a huge problem, and my friend actually had to move out of her rent stabilized apartment in a building on the Lower East Side because she was so sure that the landlord and the tenants would never get it together to get rid of them.&nbsp; So she knew that even if she could rid her apt. of them that it would only be temporary as they would begin to travel back via the electrial outlets/pipes etc from the other infested units.<br /><br />She was extremely careful when she moved and followed every bedbug moving protocol down to the finest detail.<br /><br />Obviously it would be better if you could stay and exterminate.&nbsp; Take the time to educate yourself on www.bedbugger.com

				Bedbugs made the New York Observer&#039;s Summer Phobias List (http://www.observer.com/2008/eeeek)!<br /><br />EXCERPT from the article<br />&quot;Speaking of Duane Reade, my girlfriend and I were there on a recent Saturday afternoon, buying a can of Pronto bedbug-killing spray. Weâ€™d just scored a couple of end tables at a sidewalk sale, and despite the fact the sellers lived in an immaculate brownstone, we couldnâ€™t help shake the thought that any secondhand goods purchased in or around New York might be a vessel for those tiny, blood-sucking vermin that have induced psychological terror across the five boroughs.<br /><br />How did it get to the point where some of us canâ€™t even go to a flea market without worrying that it might have, well, actual fleas? &quot;<br />

				I moved into what I thought was a spotlessly clean apartment in May.&nbsp; Started getting bitten in July.&nbsp; I Freaked Out!&nbsp; Someone told me to buy a product called Haunt.&nbsp; It is available at Long Island Janitorial Supply on Roosevelt near the train station.&nbsp; I bought plastic matress covers for both the box spring and mattress at the linen store on 82nd St.&nbsp; Take everything out of the room except the bed.&nbsp; Spray all along the baseboard and inside the closet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Spray the mattress and boxspring. Put the plastic cover on the matress and boxspring.&nbsp; Spray them some more.&nbsp; PROBLEM SOLVED.&nbsp; As a precaution, I spray the perimeter of the room and under the bad every Saturday, just to be sure.&nbsp; No bugs, no bites ever since.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I was woken up this morning by an incredible itch on my lower back. I noticed I also had a bite on my leg, foot, arm and toe. Im really worried that it could be bedbugs but I have not found any of the evidence that my research online said to look for. Is it still possible for a mosquito to have gotten into my bedroom at this time of year? And bit me up that bad? Or should I start panicking now?

				It sure sounds like bedbugs to me.&nbsp; You might not see the bugs for a while, but eventually you will wake up and&nbsp; see them in your bed.&nbsp; The move slowly, about as fast as an ant.&nbsp; &nbsp;They do not jump or fly.&nbsp; They are different sizes, depending on their age and wheter or not they have just bitten you, becuase they suck your blood and they get bigger and fatter when they are full.&nbsp; The sooner you act to take care of this, the better off you will be. It does not matter that you have not been on a trip.&nbsp; They come into your apartment from neighboring units through the walls, floors, closets and electircal outlets.&nbsp; Most of all, do not become scared or upset.&nbsp; The bugs are disgusting and gross, but they will go away if you take action.

				I live in a house, and my father is away most of the week, so I don&#039;t know if he has them too or not. Last night I slept on the couch and had one bite, though, which makes me think its a mosquito. Im hoping it is something else and I was just paranoid but I will find out soon enough and let you guys know.

Needless to say, it was a trying ordeal. Thankfully, though, we have not had any problems for the last six months. Now we are considering selling the apartment. Are we required to tell prospective buyers about the bedbugs? <br /><br />A Edward I. Sumber, a White Plains lawyer whose clients include the Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Boards of Realtors, said the state&#039;s Property Condition Disclosure Act, which mandates that house sellers give buyers a disclosure statement about the property&#039;s condition, does not apply to co-op and condominium owners. <br /><br /><br />What does apply to apartment owners, however, is common law, which has been established through judicial rulings over the centuries. &#039;&#039;Under the doctrine of caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware -- the seller has no affirmative obligation to reveal circumstances about the apartment to the buyer,&#039;&#039; Mr. Sumber said. <br /><br />But he added that if a prospective buyer asks a specific question about whether the apartment has had bedbugs, the seller has an obligation to answer honestly. <br /><br />In addition, if the real estate broker knows about the bedbug problem, he or she has an obligation to reveal it to a prospective buyer. &#039;&#039;The broker is under an affirmative duty to be diligent,&#039;&#039; Mr. Sumber said. &#039;&#039;But the seller is not required to tell the broker, either.&#039;&#039; <br /><br />Under the disclosure act, the seller of a one- to four-family house is supposed to complete a 48-question disclosure statement about the property&#039;s condition and give it to the buyer before a contract is signed. One of the questions asks whether there has been any pest infestation in the house. <br /><br />The penalty for failing to provide the form is a $500 credit to the buyer. So, Mr. Sumber said, many sellers are willing to take that option to avoid filling out the statement and having to answer the questions. <br /><br /><br />http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D9113AF933A15752C0A96E9C8B63

				Don&#039;t seriously know about hthe rules prevailing there. You can get a better idea from an advocate. But if your house is infested with bedbugs then it is better you treat them against bedbugs. You may either call for an exterminator or go in for a package from [company] Whatever you do act fast as the bugs will make your life a hell if they start sucking your blood!

				This document is courtesy of JH families yahoo group<br /><br /><strong>Bed Bug Information for Superintendents</strong><br /><br />Bed bugs have become an epidemic throughout the New York Metro area. Although the<br />name bed bug makes us think the insects are found only in our bedrooms, this is not the<br />case. Bed bugs are found on buses and trains, in movie theaters, locker rooms, schools, in office spaces and in discarded mattresses and furniture. Please read and follow the guidelines below. If you suspect bed bugs, please let your coop board, managing agent or landlord know immediately.<br /><br /><br />Coop board, managing agent or landlord name and phone number<br /><br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bed bugs are reddish-brown, flat, oval, wingless insects up to 1/4 of an inch long. Nymphs (babies) have a translucent, barely visible body no bigger than a speck of dust.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bed bugs infest all types of facilities and living environments, even the cleanest homes.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bed bugs like to hide in seams and cracks and crevices. They are very difficult to see and find. You can take them home with you from an infested location in your clothing or bag or if you handle infested items or discarded furniture.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of an infestation will be tiny black speckled droppings (which look like dots made by a fine felt-tipped marker), molted skins, tiny eggs and bites. Not everyone reacts to bites, it is possible to have bed bugs and not have bites.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing away infested furniture will not get rid of bed bugs. A pest control professional must be called. Do not try to do your own extermination.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that tenants may not be forthcoming about having bed bugs.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please alert coop board, managing agent or landlord if a tenant discards beds, mattresses, upholstered furniture or anything you suspect may have bedbugs. <br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items you suspect are infested with bed bugs should be sealed (not just wrapped) in plastic immediately and disposed of as soon as possible.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please write: Caution: May Contain Bed Bugs on any suspect items to be discarded, after you have wrapped them in plastic.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can kill live bugs by spraying them with full-strength rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol will not kill eggs or bugs that are hiding. <br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take precautions if you have been working with materials you suspect to be infested with bed bugs. You can kill bugs that may have gotten into your clothing, by putting all clothes, including shoes into the dryer on high heat for at least one half hour.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find a bed bug, seal it in a zip-loc bag and save it for the exterminator.<br /><br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must ACT FAST if you think you or someone in your building has bed bugs! Call your coop board, managing agent or landlord immediately. <br />

				The <strong>New York Times</strong> recently sat down with Louis Sorkin, an entomologist at The Museum of Natural History to discuss bedbugs.<br /><br /><strong>The New York Times</strong><br />The Man Who Lets the Bedbugs Bite (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/thecity/22bedb.html?_r=1&amp;ref=thecity)<br />By SAKI KNAFO<br />Published: February 20, 2009<br /><br />LOUIS SORKIN has been an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History since 1978, and he is an expert in that most reviled blood-sucking creature, the bed bug. As bed-bug complaints in the city have skyrocketed in recent years â€” calls to 311 rose 34 percent, to 9,213, in the past fiscal year â€” New Yorkers have flocked to him for advice. <br /><br />A mild-mannered man who studied entomology at the University of Connecticut, Mr. Sorkin, 55, works in an office cluttered with vials and jars, a picture of Spiderman, old typewriters and shelves lined with bug-related literature (â€œThe Ants of Ohio,â€ â€œSphecid Wasps of the Worldâ€). Tarantulas live in tanks by the office door.<br /><br />As hundreds of bed bugs crawled inside a jar on the table in front of him, Mr. Sorkin spoke about the insects and about City Council hearings, scheduled for Tuesday, that will focus on bills designed to address the problem.<br /><br />On a normal day we might receive a package of preserved spiders and insects from Honduras or Nicaragua or Australia. Scorpions are taken out; someone else works on them. Spiders are given to me. <br /><br />I identify them to the family level or further and label them: wolf spiders, fishing spiders, widow spiders, goblin spiders. Once theyâ€™re labeled, they go into the collection. The spider collection takes up four rooms.<br /><br />There are only a few drawers of bed bugs, but we have species you would normally only see on a bird or bat somewhere.<br /><br />Around 1989, someone brought in our first bed bug. Most entomologists had never seen a live infestation before. Now, infestations may be approaching the levels of 50 years ago, before DDT was used.<br /><br />Some of the chemicals used now appear to have similarities to DDT, but bed bugs have developed ways of bypassing the toxicity. Some bugs were recently collected here in New York, and a journal article reported that they were 300 times more resistant than other bed bugs to one of the common insecticides.<br /><br /><strong><em>[Follow above link for complete article.]</em></strong>

				Amazing, this guy has a really high tolerance for things that could be considered disgusting.<br /><br />He calmly says this:<br /><br /><em>A pest-control company once brought in slippers from a [bed bug] infested apartment. You could see all the eggs that had been plastered onto the soles and all the bugs that were hiding</em>.<br /><br />And finishes up with this about cicadas:<br /><br /><em><strong>I still collect cicadas.</strong> I sometimes bring them here and feed them to the spiders. <strong>Or I eat them.</strong> I put them in a little butter or oil and garlic and quickly sautÃ© them. Iâ€™m very interested in entomophagy â€” the use of insects as food.</em>

				Michael, I&#039;m sure there are a lot of preventative measures, but one I never heard of before was don&#039;t bring used wooden furniture into your home.&nbsp; Apparently the bed bugs love to hide and breed in the crevices.&nbsp; From time to time you see wonderful pieces of wood furniture discarded on the sidewalk or offered at yard sales.&nbsp; After hearing the bed bug warning, it&#039;s something I now avoid.

But that gets tricky as well, since many people borrow books from the library and rent DVDs etc.&nbsp; It does make sense in this day and age in a large city such as NYC to NEVER EVER take any items from the sidewalk that others have discarded.&nbsp; I personally won&#039;t shop at a flea market or thrift shop any more either.<br /><br />Some people who have had infestations in the past are being extra vigilant after overnight trips in hotels and some have purchased a product that&#039;s called a Pack-tite, which is, as far as I understand, a collapsible-electrical unit that is large enough to accommodate a suitcase.&nbsp; When people return from their trip, they put the suitcase in the unit and turn it on; it reaches whatever temperature necessary to kill bugs and eggs.&nbsp; But since bugs can be found in many places besides hotels, it seems that you would need to use this unit every time you return from stepping outside of the house or apartment. This doesn&#039;t seem realistic.<br /><br />I have read that people such as bedbug professionals/exterminators who may be especially prone to bringing a hitchhiking bedbug into their home are doing weekly or monthly inspections of their sleeping area.&nbsp; They sleep on all white non-patterned bedding and linens so that they can examine any evidence (the excrement can look like ball point pen marks on the sheets).&nbsp; They are aware that not everyone is allergic to bites, so they don&#039;t rely on itchy skin to tell them they have a problem.<br /><br />[Other hyper-vigilant people with means are hiring bedbug dogs to inspect their homes on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; I think some hotels are doing this as well.]<br /><br />Anyway, since they are bug professionals, I presume that if they get infested and catch their infestation early that it is relatively straightforward for them to deal with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The problem comes when infestations are allowed to get large and out of control and spread throughout buildings.&nbsp; That&#039;s why education is so important.&nbsp; I think if everyone knows what to look for and how to handle a problem if it comes about, then NYC won&#039;t be so plagued by these things.

				our building hired an exterminator to come in an give us an educational seminar on prevention.&nbsp; Here is what he told us: there is no failsafe way to entirely prevent bedbugs from getting into your apartment/house, but some measures can be taken to decrease your chances of getting them. The suggestions are preventive NOT treatment. He suggested periodic spraying of your mattress and boxspring with rubbing alcohol.&nbsp; Use a q-tip dipped in alcohol to go around the seams. Keep bed away from the walls.&nbsp; Go over your mattress periodically with a lint roller as an inspection tool. Purchase double sided tape (the kind they use for carpets) and wrap it around the legs of the bed.&nbsp; Purchase specially designed mattress and box spring covers.&nbsp; They also sell a product call interceptors which is a small dish like object that you place under the legs of your bed.<br />All these can be&nbsp; viewed and/or purchased via www.bugoffpccenter.com<br />He also said not to get crazy about it but if you find anything to call an exterminator immediately for an inspection, the earlier the treatment the easier it is.

				This is a coop in Manhattan, not Queens, but still... there is a lesson here, and that lesson is to become educated about bedbugs so that your coop&#039;s reserve fund doesn&#039;t take a $250,000 hit.<br /><br />&nbsp;Co-op hair-raiser: $250,000 bed bug bill &nbsp;(http://brickunderground.com/blog/2009/07/the_250000_bedbug_bill)<br /><br />On a related note, I have read about a product called the Climb-up interceptors, which I think are like small cups with a powder that are placed under the four feet of the bed. &nbsp;They intercept the bugs and keep them imprisoned in the little cups. &nbsp;This is purely just so that you are alerted to the fact that bedbugs are in your home. &nbsp;It is not an extermination tool.<br /><br />Since there doesn&#039;t seem to be too much in the way of prevention that is possible, that makes early detection and early treatment the key. &nbsp;I also read that many people are not allergic to the bugbites and can develop quite a large infestation before they notice it, so these interceptors could be the answer to the problem of early detection.<br /><br />Perhaps there are similar products on the market and maybe even more products that will come on the market soon.<br /><br />(edited to add that I see Dotley already mentioned the interceptors in her post above from a few months ago.)

				Maybe this article will help, at least for a start. &nbsp;However, this article is a year old and there have most likely been more precedents set since then.<br /><br /><strong>Dealing with Bedbugs <br />by Richard Siegler and Eva Talel <br />New York Law Journal <br />November 5, 2008 </strong> <br /><br />Bedbugs are making a major resurgence in the United States. Through June 19, 2008, 8,840 bedbug complaints were filed with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) by rental tenants, compared with 6,889 in all of 2007, an increase estimated at 28.3 percent. HPD issued 2,757 bedbug violations in 2008, up from 2,008 in 2007, or an estimated increase of 37.3 percent.[1] Managers of co-op and condominium buildings report similar trends.[2] <br /><br />After World War II, liberal use of the pesticide DDT nearly eradicated bedbugs in the United States. Their resurgence is attributed to increased international travel; restrictions on the use of DDT; and the difficulty in eradicating bedbugs. They are minuscule, hide in cracks, crevices and inside mattresses and pillows and go easily undetected. While there is a common misconception that bedbugs are attracted by unsanitary conditions, their sole objective is finding a feeding sourceâ€”human blood. Although bedbug bites do not spread disease and are not fatal, they leave itchy red lesions on the skin and their nocturnal feeding habits are traumatic for victims.[3] <br /><br />Bedbugs present a challenge for co-op and condominium boards: is the apartment owner or the board responsible for eradicating an infestation? This column addresses this novel issue and discusses cases in New York and other states dealing with damage to persons and property from bedbug infestations. This column also provides guidance to boards and managers in dealing with bedbug infestations in co-op and condominium buildings. <br /><br />Proprietary Lease <br /><br />The touchstone for board and shareholder responsibility in a co-op is the proprietary lease. Generally, tenant-shareholders are responsible for keeping the apartment interior in good repair while the co-op/lessor is responsible for keeping the building in good repair. Therefore, an apartment owner should be responsible for remediating a bedbug infestation within the apartment. However, where multiple apartments are infested and it is difficult to identify the source, the infestation may become a board responsibility. Further, even where only a single apartment is infested, the protections afforded residential tenants by the warranty of habitability may obligate the board to remediate, unless the shareholderâ€™s personal property is demonstrably the source of infestation. <br /><br />Warranty of Habitability <br /><br />The warranty of habitability, codified in New York Real Property Law (RPL) Â§235-b, implies a nonwaiveable warranty in every residential lease that the apartment is fit for human habitation and free of dangerous conditions detrimental to the health, life, or safety of its occupants.[4]......<br /><br />Click link for the rest &nbsp;-- it&#039;s a pdf. http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub663.pdf<br />

				Well, if we have an entire board studying their health concerns, they must at least be appreciative.&nbsp; It seems&nbsp; lately that they&#039;re more concerned than ever about people.

				All joking aside, I recently read an article in The New York Times where people were commenting on why DDT is not being legalized considering that it was effective in controlling and/or eliminating bed bugs in years past. &nbsp;Basically, the argument was that DDT, while toxic, should be a pesticide that only pest control specialists would use with proper training. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know enough on the topic of DDT, so I can&#039;t opine on whether this would be a good idea. &nbsp;I figure that if it has been banned, there must be good reason behind that banning.

				I&#039;ve read that the new generation of bedbugs is so hardy they are not bothered by a little DDT, so bringing it back would make no difference (or not enough of a difference) to this new plague.&nbsp; I can&#039;t cite my source or provide a quote, but I am pretty sure I got this almost right!

				Yeah, it&#039;s true that DDT stopped working against bed bugs well before DDT was banned.&nbsp; The bed bugs became resistant to it and likely still carry those resistance genes at some frequency in the population.<br /><br />http://newyorkvsbedbugs.org/2008/05/15/ddt-resistance-once-more-with-tables-and-sources/ (http://newyorkvsbedbugs.org/2008/05/15/ddt-resistance-once-more-with-tables-and-sources/)<br /><br />Nicholas Kristof in the NY Times has written multiple columns promoting the use of DDT in Africa to control malaria without ever addressing the issue of DDT resistance (most mosquito populations are already resistant to DDT, and those that aren&#039;t would evolve resistance very quickly).&nbsp; DDT has just been a cudgel for naysayers and right-wingers to beat environmentalists over the head with for many years now.&nbsp; It was banned because it caused global catastrophic declines in bird life, including the near-extinctions of the Bald Eagle and Peregrine falcon.&nbsp; Those two species have only recovered in the last 10 years.<br /><br />As for the original topic...I think it would be near-impossible for the co-op to &quot;prove&quot; that the bedbugs originated in your apartment only and were brought in by you or your guests.&nbsp; Are there any 311 complaints for bedbugs in your building?&nbsp; You can check online.&nbsp; If so, then the co-op would likely be responsible.

				Apparently there have been several cases in Astoria of residents pouring gasoline or kerosene on their mattresses, and even rubbing it on their kids, in order to get rid of bedbugs, if this gothamist article &nbsp;(http://gothamist.com/2009/12/21/fdny_pouring_gas_on_mattress_not_th.php) is to be believed.<br /><br />Do not try this at home!!&nbsp; Dangerous and doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; And if you smell gasoline or kerosene coming from someone else&#039;s apartment in your building, call 911!

				Interesting <strong>New York Times</strong> article on the use and accuracy of dogs as a means of detecting bedbugs.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>The New York Times</strong><br />Dogs That Detect Bedbugs (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/garden/11bedbug.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sudsredirect=true)<br />By PENELOPE GREEN<br />Published: March 10, 2010<br /><br />CRUISER made four house calls on a recent rain-soaked Tuesday. There were two happy endings and two unhappy ones, a fairly typical outcome for a typical day in the life of a bedbug-sniffing puggle.<br /><br />â€œExcept that thereâ€™s nothing typical about this business,â€ said his handler, Jeremy Ecker, 35, whose six-month-old company, the Bed Bug Inspectors, has vetted hotels, college dorms and Midtown office buildings, suburban homes, bare-bones Brooklyn rentals and tony Manhattan co-ops. (Mr. Ecker, who charges $350 for a residential inspection, is an independent inspector, meaning he has no affiliation with an exterminator, though many hire him to check a property they have treated.)<br /><br />Increasingly, real estate lawyers are urging buyers in contract to inspect apartments before they close, and in their advertising, many pest control companies exhort would-be tenants to â€œinspect before you rent.â€ And dogs like Cruiser can inspect a room in minutes, whereas lesser mammals like human beings need hours to conduct a visual inspection.<br /><br />Bedbug-sniffing dogs, adorable yet stunningly accurate â€” entomology researchers at the University of Florida report that well-trained dogs can detect a single live bug or egg with 96 percent accuracy â€” are the new and furry front line in an escalating and confounding domestic war.<br /><br />While experts cite a host of reasons for the upsurge, they agree on one thing: the bugs, which were mostly eradicated in this country at midcentury by now-banned pesticides like DDT but remained a constant scourge overseas, are finding their way back to the United States through an increase in global travel. <br /><br /><strong><em>[Follow above link for complete article.]</em></strong><br />
