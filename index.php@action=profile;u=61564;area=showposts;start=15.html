					I can&#039;t help but wonder.. especially since it&#039;s happening on another block just 10 blocks away..<br />could this be the beginning of an effort to push out those businesses and eventually tear down this two story building for <br />development into a higher-rise building?&nbsp; I doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s technically part of the &quot;historic district? -- any one know if it is?<br />imagine what the property would be worth to a developer looking to go tall.&nbsp; Plus as we saw with Target building, the city only<br />says YES to that idea in our neighborhood.<br /><br />

					wow.. That ad/poster is blatantly racist and offensive IMHO.&nbsp; <br />Wonder how many stores and businesses are displaying it.&nbsp; Guess none that ever want &quot;gringo&quot; dollars... <br />Not to mention the fact that Viva La Comida is a chance for many small businesses in JH and Elmhurst to show off their menu.&nbsp; Way to turn a celebration of that into something political for your own benefit folks. <br /><br />Ironically, the best I can tell is that the poster was made by some guy from CALIFORNIA who moved to Jackson Heights. <br />Life is full of ironies, right? <br /><br />toddg got it right ...&nbsp; Viva La Comida is more authentically of this neighborhood than they are.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

					The bustle of Jackson Heights is an asset.. when I go to sprawling neighborhoods like Forest Hills, Kew Gardens or LIC they seem..<br />dead, uninteresting, dare I say soulless in a neighborhoody sorta way.&nbsp; Okay, that may be a step too far -- but you get <br />where I am coming from.<br />&nbsp;<br />I also think the average age in Jackson Heights is also lower.. <br />and perhaps that helps to create a different more inclusive vibe, one that&#039;s open to a new generation of families IMHO<br />

					I moved here because I was priced out of Brooklyn two decades go.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was also a great value for the space you <br />got in these pre-war cops compared to other neighborhoods.<br /><br />But more importantly, I STAYED...

					I hate to be negative about efforts to make improvements... but.. <br />The real tragedy ti ne is that whatever money is spent to create something won&#039;t matter in weeks or months <br />due to the fact that nothing in the city is maintained, <br />from basic garbage collection to repairing dead trees, etc.&nbsp; That area doesn&#039;t have a BID either... so it&#039;s not like the area businesses care about <br />taking care of things outside of their front doors.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Maybe that filing cabinet guy can move other there and create a virtual bazaar of used 1980s <br />office furniture.&nbsp;

					Yes the place looks GREAT and would be a very welcome addition to JH.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably be a frequent customer... And I wish these guys all the luck in the world.<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />Contributing to a private enterprise seems, at best, bizarre.&nbsp; That&#039;s what customers do when they buy your products. Putting cash upfront is what investors]do, for a share of the company and its (eventual) profits.&nbsp; <br />When did this become a thing? Espresso 77 tried the same maneuver when they expanded their store with a similar ask for &quot;donations.&quot;&nbsp; Wonder how many people they suckered.&nbsp; <br /><br />These are NOT community not-for-profits. If this confuses anyone, please Google &quot;capitalism.&quot; <br /><br />if you feel the need to donate to something, I&#039;d agree with Spanky&#039;s comment: Give your cash to to Food Bank or one of the other charities that feed people.<br />

					My evening walk got me wondering... <br />While 82nd Street has turned into a mall (Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Sketchers, Foot Locker, GNC, Children&#039;s Place plus national chain fast food, banks and cell phone stores... even Target soon) it&#039;s sad to see some prime spots on 37th Avenue remain empty for months.&nbsp; No, make that YEARS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ingrid&#039;s old hair salon at 79th Street.&nbsp; The Gothic furniture shop at 83rd Street both spring to mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe the new strategy should be to start calling out commercial landlords for allowing their property to linger in a semi-abandoned state. <br /><br />So who owns that Ingrid&#039;s space you ask? The NYC website points to a company called CAIMAN REALTY LLC&nbsp; ( see how much they pay in taxes HERE: <a href="http://webapps.nyc.gov:8084/CICS/f704/f403001I?BBL=4-01278-0038-" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://webapps.nyc.gov:8084/CICS/f704/f403001I?BBL=4-01278-0038-</a> ) <br />While real estate filings are pretty complicated with various holding companies, it looks like it&#039;s the same company that is also the owner of what also seems to be a pretty vacant building on 75th Street.&nbsp; ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y865yrt3" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/y865yrt3</a> ) as well as some other properties in JH.&nbsp; No surprise here.. but it also looks like the person at the head of the company lives on Long Island, not JH. <br /><br />It&#039;s a well kept commercial building, to give credit where it&#039;s due. And I get that landlords are taking write-offs to pad their tax losses... but for the neighborhood&#039;s sake they should do something with them in the meantime.&nbsp; Imagine if Ingrid&#039;s were gallery of JH artists until a new store rented it.&nbsp; Heck, you could even hang art in the window and keep the doors locked and it would be less of a blight.&nbsp; There are probably lots of other ideas such as renting as a &quot;pop up&quot; store for the holiday season coming up.&nbsp; &nbsp;It may even raise the value of the property and others you may own in the neighborhood!<br /><br />Landlords aren&#039;t the enemy.&nbsp; If you think about it, they&#039;re for better or worse part of what makes any neighborhood what it is.&nbsp; So come on landlords, think of the community.&nbsp; Better yet, lower your rent and allow someone to actually rent the property.&nbsp; That Ingrids building goes for $52/sq ft and the last store rented for $14K/month per Street Easy ( that info is at <a href="http://streeteasy.com/building/78_19-37-avenue-queens#tab_building_detail=3" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/building/78_19-37-avenue-queens#tab_building_detail=3</a> )&nbsp; <br /><br />One other fun find..<br />So what&#039;s that building worth you ask?<br />Current year&#039;s total market value of the land: $1,100,000<br />Current year&#039;s total market value of improvements: $3,082,000 (it was $2,003,000 in 2012)<br />Current year&#039;s total market value: $4,182,000 (it was $3,103,000 in 2012)<br />Read more: <a href="http://www.city-data.com/ny-properties/assessments/Queens/3/37th-Avenue-22.html#ixzz4tkV2xb2d" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.city-data.com/ny-properties/assessments/Queens/3/37th-Avenue-22.html#ixzz4tkV2xb2d</a><br /><br /><br />

					The former New York Cho Dae Church was sold in August 2013 for $7 million.<br />Wonder how many of the 139 units will be designated affordable housing?&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s not in the historical district.&nbsp; Here&#039;s a great example of why that designation matters:<br /><br /><a href="https://newyorkyimby.com/2016/08/residential-expansion-of-35-64-85th-street-jackson-heights-still-not-a-winner-at-landmarks.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://newyorkyimby.com/2016/08/residential-expansion-of-35-64-85th-street-jackson-heights-still-not-a-winner-at-landmarks.html</a><br /><br />It thankfully stopped a horrendous cheap-looking 80s redux building from showing up in the historic district last year (or at least for now)

					I have no problem with indie vendors but this is a huge spread on an already crowded public sidewalk.&nbsp; The city routinely harasses tax paying businesses that put displays on the sidewalk in front of their stores, so how can they turn a blind eye here?&nbsp; I&#039;m no Peralta apologist, but he probably deserves credit and not scorn for trying to negotiate something here between store owners and this vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ODDEST thing about this vendor is the prices are NOT all that great considering there&#039;s no overhead.&nbsp; The merchandise is a better price -- and certainly much better quality -- at any of scores of produces shops here in the 11372. <br /><br />it&#039;s such a constant fixture in that area that even shows up on Google Maps!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/96-15+Roosevelt+Ave,+Flushing,+NY+11368/@40.7492648,-73.8686447,3a,90y,355.13h,64.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-PfInB7B0pEUp1Ro1znapQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25fb9ce73ae9f:0x8524afdf5334313a!8m2!3d40.7494111!4d-73.8687775" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/maps/place/96-15+Roosevelt+Ave,+Flushing,+NY+11368/@40.7492648,-73.8686447,3a,90y,355.13h,64.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-PfInB7B0pEUp1Ro1znapQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25fb9ce73ae9f:0x8524afdf5334313a!8m2!3d40.7494111!4d-73.8687775</a><br />

					The fact that Montserrate got 45% should be a wake up call to Queens Democrats that the anti-establishment mood is alive and well and living even here in NYC.&nbsp; That said, I wonder if Montserrate allies spent too much time putting their efforts into District 25 otherwise known as Daniel Dromm&#039;s district.&nbsp; I saw tons of signs in the historic district that Montserrate wouldn&#039;t have even represented.&nbsp; Got to wonder what would&#039;ve happened if Montserrate moved into District 25 to take Dromm on and not split the Hispanic vote with Moya.&nbsp; Keep a lookout for a U-Haul rolling up to Montserrate&#039;s house tomorrow (or sometime before the next filing deadline).&nbsp; Dromm ran unopposed today FWIW.

					It has been months, perhaps years, since I saw a NYPD cop walking the streets of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Occasionally you used to even see cops on horseback.&nbsp; Today? Never.&nbsp; it&#039;s little wonder crimes like this happen when a cop never gets out of his/her car unless it&#039;s to put a ticket on a car window to saddle their butts into that ugly police tower that resembles a prison tower on 37th Avenue and 90th Street.&nbsp; <br /><br />
