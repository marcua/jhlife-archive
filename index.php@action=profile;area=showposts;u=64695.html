					A small excerpt from this very good criticism of Citizen:<br /><a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2020/02/24/citizen-app-philadelphia/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.phillymag.com/news/2020/02/24/citizen-app-philadelphia/</a><br /><br /><em>&quot;Another concern: The constant crime notifications coming in through Citizen have the potential to shape users’ psychology, says Temple criminal justice professor Ajima Olaghere. Maybe someone watches a series of crime-scene videos in a neighborhood with boarded-up homes. There’s nothing criminal about boarded-up homes, but now an association has been made. In facilitating this, the app “reinforces perceptions of people’s ideas of crime and fear.” These “notions of ‘disorder,&#039;” she adds, “stoke fear in people and often translate to a 911 call” even when nothing criminal is going on.<br /><br />Citizen can also shift the perspective of longtime residents. Lynn Rinaldi, who has lived in Girard Estates for 20 years, never used to worry about coming home late at night after work at Paradiso, the East Passyunk restaurant she used to own. But she recently downloaded Citizen, and seeing all the crime notifications “created a little bit of anxiety for me,” she says. “I started to say, I’m not going to take my car out after dark; I’ll just Uber if have to go somewhere.” Though she decided to stop checking the app, it’s easy to imagine how Citizen could produce a self-perpetuating cycle in someone else: A user downloads Citizen and becomes more anxious about crime; the person becomes hyper-vigilant and starts calling 911 when something “suspicious” goes on; that, in turn, generates new Citizen notifications, which ultimately makes everyone else using the app more paranoid, too.&quot;</em>

They must match the paint color , shape etc... To the best of my knowledge, these types of custom windows are very expensive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Greystones are also landmarked (as I&#039;m sure you know) so that doesn&#039;t explain it. I think part of the issue from having looked at a few Chateau apartments when we were buying is that some small co-ops, including it seems like many of the Chateaus, treat windows as a co-op responsibility and thus the entire board/building has to agree to the upgrade (and it is quite expensive). I do think individual owners who might be otherwise inclined to upgrade their windows might hold out for their windows to be replaced as a co-op expense, with a discount for having the entire building done instead of just 1 unit. But then, you know, co-op inertia and then it never happens...

Telling people to move on from a traumatic experience in a way that makes <em>you</em> feel comfortable is problematic. You don&#039;t tell someone they&#039;ve &quot;grieved long enough&quot; or had &quot;enough time to move on&quot; after a loss, and if you do, well you ARE an asshole (your word) even if you don&#039;t mean to be.<br /><br />I am vaccinated, my young kids have had covid, and we still wear masks when we are outside and around others. We feel it is a sign of respect for our community which has been through a lot, we don&#039;t want our older or unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable neighbors to have to wonder why we don&#039;t have them on. There is some serious projecting going on to say it&#039;s because we are &quot;crippled by fear.&quot; My kids are happy, well-adjusted, and understand that this is a temporary thing we are doing to be able to see friends and do activities they love.<br /><br />Look, I am a doctor have professional training in public health as well. There are individual behaviors that primarily harm the individual, like smoking or eating junk food. There are individual behaviors that have a real risk of harming others and thus should be regulated, things like driving drunk, having unsecured guns in your home, or not wearing a mask during a pandemic. And then there are individual behaviors that you might find weird or stupid but they don&#039;t hurt anybody, so you just let people live their lives and do what makes them happy, things like washing pre-washed lettuce. You&#039;ve tried hard to argue that wearing a mask falls into the 1st or 2nd category, but it doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s the last one. I&#039;m quite sure it will be easier just to explain this to your kids than it will be to convince our neighborhood to get over their pandemic trauma on your schedule.

That&#039;s your choice at this point, since yes CDC has updated their recommendation. <br /><br />Those of us who are choosing to keep the practice a bit longer does not equate to &quot;creating a dangerous brain change&quot; (scientific term) for society.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you Dijon. Honestly I don&#039;t know why I keep bothering to respond here because I feel like 80JHer is just trolling at this point, but you are so right, why do they care so much whether other people continue to feel it is a sign of respect for others? Or it if gives them a sense of security after the awfulness of this past year?<br /><br />This &quot;masks cause brain damage&quot; argument is really mind-boggling to me. 80JHer, do you truly believe all the doctors, nurses, and other health care workers who have been working in N95s throughout the pandemic are now brain damaged from all this mask wearing? Who do you intend to get your medical care from in the future? I guess you can ask a never-masked rando off the street take your appendix out since their brain is more intact than these hypoxic, hypercarbic, CO2-poisoned doctors, but that seems unwise.<br /><br />The one thing we do agree on is that the vaccination rates and infection rates are great news. Keep it up JH!!

					The answer, unfortunately, is that it&#039;s way too soon.&nbsp; There is emerging evidence that some of the new variants, like B.1.1.7, are a lot more transmissible among kids in school and other congregate settings and some variants may be associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. (<a href="https://khn.org/morning-breakout/kids-play-huge-role-in-spreading-b-1-1-7-variant-osterholm-says/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://khn.org/morning-breakout/kids-play-huge-role-in-spreading-b-1-1-7-variant-osterholm-says/</a>)<br /><br />What we are waiting for is more data on variants and for a larger proportion of our population to be vaccinated.&nbsp; We have made it so far and I know we are tired, but this is not the time to start relaxing on the proven core-4 measures (masking, social distancing, hand washing, stay home when feeling sick).<br /><br />There&#039;s no rush.

					Sorry I can&#039;t help you C2, but I am responding to your thread to try to keep the forum organized.<br /><br />Can anyone share what the going rate is for show shoveling (per occurance)?&nbsp; Esp anyone in small co-op who outsources this (i.e. does not have a live in super).&nbsp; About 25-30 feet of sidewalk plus 10 feet of walkway/stoop.<br /><br />Thank you!

					This is a kind gesture but vaccine administration is highly regulated by the NYSDOH. You must be a qualified health professional in order to administer vaccines.&nbsp; Cuomo has expanded the list of qualified professions that can vaccinate (includes health professions students) but a lay person who knows how to self-inject is not among the categories.&nbsp; Vaccination sites must also have a person certified in CPR on site while vaccinations are being administered. (Please see this link for details:<br /><a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/vaccination-training" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/vaccination-training</a>) The vaccine also has tightly regulated storage requirements (e.g. hours it must be used within after being thawed) and losing that &quot;chain of custody&quot; over the vaccine by having lay people carry their own vials to people&#039;s homes has the potential to result in people receiving spoiled vaccine.<br /><br />I do think some sites would welcome volunteers who could assist with registering people arriving for their appointments. You could also assist in helping elderly and/or disabled neighbors with appointment scheduling, transportation, and so on.
