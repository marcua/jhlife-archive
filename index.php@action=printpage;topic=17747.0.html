				Saw some work happening at the old McDonald&#039;s at Roosevelt and 76th this morning, so I poked around online and saw that someone has added a new restaurant, &quot;Laly&#039;s,&quot; to the Google map for that address (https://goo.gl/zzDKB5) and it looks like they&#039;ve filed with NYS under that address/name too. The one 5-star review is a &quot;coming soon&quot; note. Anyone here know more?

				&quot;American Mexican&quot; is a strange term, and sounds unappealing.&nbsp; It evokes bad Mexican chain restaurants.&nbsp; California-style taquerias or Tex-Mex cuisine can be great, but they don&#039;t use the term &quot;American Mexican.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps Laly&#039;s will attempt to reinterpret and elevate Americanized Mexican food, like Saw Shack has done for Americanized Chinese food.&nbsp; If done well, that could be interesting.&nbsp; Here&#039;s hoping.

				I passed by Laly&#039;s yesterday, and it has a decidedly un-Mexican menu.&nbsp; Mostly simple fare with Mexican-inspired appetizers but mostly American entrees and a breakfast menu that looks more like a brunch menu.<br /><br />Some entrees Steak &amp; Frites $18, Fish &amp; Chips $16, and Roasted Chicken $14.<br />Cobb Salad $12, House Salad $10, Kale Salad $11<br />Burgers, Chicken Sandwich<br />Apps include Buffalo Wings $10, Fish Tacos $8, Chimichangas $7, Veggie Chili $6 and Nachos $8.<br />Cream Cheese Flan and Cheesecake for dessert.

				My husband and I went for dinner on Thursday evening. Friendly service, tasty food.&nbsp; We trialled a few things to share and enjoyed them all! Lots of flavor in the guac. Classic mexican street corn. Well toasted quesadilla with the right balance of meat to cheese (not 100% cheese which always makes me feel insanely glutinous and mildly ill). And yummy grain bowl, which I haven&#039;t found anywhere in the neighborhood previously. Highly recommend! Haven&#039;t ever walked by and seen them crowded yet... hopefully that will change!

				Going to add to the chorus of praise. I&#039;ve gone twice already. Yesterday and today. Both times for breakfast. I&#039;ve had the chilaquiles and the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. I&#039;m a convert. Both my wife and I agree that the chilaquiles may be the best we&#039;ve ever had, and I loved loved loved the Benedict. Could have been cooked through just a touch less, but it was still deliciously gooey. And the cayenne (?) sprinkled on top was a nice touch. What&#039;s even better is that the price is the same whether you get the Canadian bacon or salmon. I love it! The home fries were also super flavorful.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got to say, Queensboro has some competition for this household. But they&#039;re definitely going to appeal to different people. I wish Laly&#039;s all the luck in the world. They deserve your business. If you&#039;re sitting on the sidelines, just go.

				My husband and I ate there for lunch yesterday. We had a quesadilla and the steak tacos--all ingredients were fresh, the food was perfectly prepared, the steak in the tacos was cooked medium--you could tell the meat was not sitting for hours, it was made to order. The sauces and salsas were fresh tasting and delicious and the guacamole was perfection. They don&#039;t have a liquor license yet, but there&#039;s a bar area set up in the back and the manager said it&#039;s coming soon. There were fresh flowers on all the tables with CLEAN water in the vases: a sure sign that someone actually cares. It&#039;s a great addition to the neighborhood and I hope many people will support them. Can&#039;t wait to try them for dinner. They deliver, too!&nbsp;

				Will weigh in here as well...had a great breakfast yesterday trying the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and the Chilaquiles.&nbsp; The poached eggs were perfectly cooked--definitely a sign that the cook knows what he is doing. Even the side of home fried potatoes were tasty.&nbsp; The Chilaquiles also very good, included chicken as well as fried eggs.&nbsp; The salsa verde had the right spiciness (unlike Juquila where it is so spicy).&nbsp; This ranks up there with some of the memorable huevos I have had in Mexico.&nbsp; The menu seems made for me, can&#039;t wait to try Fish Tacos and some of the other dishes for dinner.&nbsp; This seems to be run by a family that cares--good service and small touches like the cold bottle of water is nice. They may work on decor a bit as they succeed.&nbsp; This will definitely be my go to place for Breakfast and Mexican food.

				Hello Jackson Heights Life ! <br /><br />I’m Rigo, manager of Laly’s Restaurant. My apologies for taking a while to introduce ourselves here on Jackson Heights Life. I’ve been hearing from our guests that I should come here and read what the community has to say about us. First, I would like to thank everyone who has already given us the chance to visit &amp; try us out! I’ve probably met some of you whether it’s been here at the restaurant or while I’ve delivered your food at your homes. <br /><br />I can understand our concept might be a bit confusing as to who we are or what we’re trying to achieve. Here’s our story: Dionisio &amp; Baltazar, brother in-laws, always had a dream of opening up a restaurant together with the concept of serving their community. They both have over 15 years experience working in well known restaurants in NYC as cooks, sous chefs, executive chefs, they’ve done it all. They both reside 10 minutes away from Laly’s Restaurant and were just waiting for the perfect opportunity to open a restaurant. McDonald’s on the corner of 76th &amp; Roosevelt closed down and they saw the perfect opportunity. Their mission was to serve their community &amp; they came up with the “American &amp; Mexican”concept . Ive known Dionisio &amp; Baltazar for years &amp; they reached out to me &amp; offered me the chance to be part of the team and run the front of house. I’ve been also working front of house positions since I was 15 years old. Our main focus is being part of the community &amp; serving the freshest food. We get some of our meat &amp; dairy products from Sullivan farms from upstate NY. &amp; I’m Tuesday’s we’ll even make a run to our farmers market on Tuesdays &amp; get local vegetables from Gageski Produce from Riverhead Long Island. We offer a mixture of both American &amp; Mexican platters for breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner. From homemade blueberry pancakes , eggs Benedict to chilaquiles &amp; huevos rancheros. For burgers &amp; sandwiches we offer our already popular cemita burger (8oz of fresh beef cooked to your liking topped with queso Oaxaca, avocado papalo)&nbsp; &amp; our bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato sandwich (B.E.L.T) served on a ciabatta. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We are still waiting on our liquor permit. Once we get the OK, we plan on offering local craft bottled beers as well as Mexican beers. We are currently working on getting a draft beer system put together. Our cocktail menu will consist of , fresh margaritas with choices of fresh flavors available to add. Not only margaritas but we will also add some signature cocktails that will include fresh ingredients as well. <br /><br />&nbsp; Service for us is very important. Dionisio, Baltazar &amp; I are here every single day &amp; this our new home. And we want everyone who steps in through our doors feel the same way. Please give us a try &amp; feel free to ask for me. &amp; to those who have already tried us out I thank you again &amp; thanks for the feedback as well.<br />

				Sounds great--I stopped by just today and picked up a menu. I was thinking about ordering delivery last night, as a matter of fact, but could not find your menu online yet. I hope your drink offerings will also include at least some wines. I look forward to coming in (or ordering) soon--I live just a block and a half away. I like the fact that you offer both Mexican options and American ones, by the way. My husband and I need to eat lighter and less spicy fare much of the time, and it looks like you do offer dishes that fit our needs. I hope things go well for Laly&#039;s!

				Chiming in to add my praise. I&#039;ve ordered online (through seamless) and visited in person now. The food was excellent in both instances. Dining-in, I found the service to be fantastic and the space spotless. Also, they have great coffee and a chill vibe. Welcome to the neighborhood, all! We&#039;ll be back soon!

				After a tasty breakfast at Laly&#039;s, went back for dinner this week.&nbsp; Both the fish tacos and chicken quesadilla were really good.&nbsp; Service was very good both times--i like that they provide a cold bottle of water, and replace it.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t that crowded on Friday evening--but once they offer beer and alcohol, it probably will pick up.&nbsp; Wishing them success...

				&nbsp;One more accolade. We both had fish entrees and they were super fresh and tasty.The little bits of fresh mango in the fish tacos<br />along with onions and pepper. Fish cooked perfectly. Fries are just the way I like them with skins on, done but not burnt. They<br />hit a spot in the neighborhood that was open for this kind of healthy, tasty Mexican food. Yes, the street carts are good but if you<br />want to sit and have a bit higher quality ingredients, this is the place.<br />

				We had dinner there last night--and we agree the food was delicious. We had the chicken quesadilla and the house salad with grilled salmon. At around 7 PM when we left, the place was literally empty. I hope business picks up for them -- it&#039;s a great option and I hope they make it! The liquor license should make a difference. But spread the word--they deserve to succeed.

				I really wanted to like this place, but I ordered delivery and the food was absolutely terrible. I ordered a &quot;grain bowl,&quot; expected it to be like a regular grain bowl I&#039;d get anywhere else, and found that it was like 95% greens with a few miniscule pieces of quinoa and other stuff thrown in. Just really bad and inedible. I also ordered fish tacos which were gross.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like to badmouth restaurants in the neighborhood, because I want them to succeed. So I will probably give Laly&#039;s another try in a few months when they&#039;ve figured some stuff out.

The banana nut pancakes are flavorful and have a nice texture. The coffee is good, too! The service is friendly, and it complements the food. Please try it out!

				they also may have a little bit of an imaging problem. it sounds like everyone here is raving about their Mexican-style dishes, but they&#039;re putting forth &quot;American and Mexican.&quot; and the place, while sparkling clean, doesn&#039;t have a lot of curb appeal in terms of visuals. it *looks* strictly coffee shop. maybe a bit of decor would help?

Laly&#039;s has the same problem sP!Lt Mi&#039;lk had. No one can tell what it is.<br /><br />1. Most of the menu hovers somewhere between diner and trendy american restaurant<br />2. But most diners and American restaurants aren&#039;t called &quot;Laly&#039;s.&quot;<br />3. It looks like a diner inside but they are missing a lot of diner food. This isn&#039;t a diner.<br />4. Authenticity is popular now. And when you have a restaurant with a few Mexican items on the menu, a Spanish-sounding name, but the food is mostly &quot;trendy&quot; american food, unfortunately I think some people are going to question the authenticity.<br /><br />Let&#039;s contrast Laly&#039;s with the Queensboro. The Queensboro is unquestionably an &quot;American restaurant.&quot; How can we tell?<br /><br />1. It has an American-sounding name<br />2. The decor is similar to other American restaurants<br />3. The food is all the type that&#039;s served at other American restaurants and it&#039;s all of a similar quality (opposed to how Laly&#039;s offers Buffalo Wings and a Kale Salad on the same menu)<br /><br />I think if Laly&#039;s re-branded right now they would have a great chance:<br /><br />1. Choose what cuisine you&#039;re going to be: American, Mexican or diner<br />2. Change the name (and sign) unless you choose Mexican<br />3. Redo the menu to be all one type of food <br />4. Change the decor if possible<br /><br />Good luck<br />

Here are some names of actual restaurants in NYC and I bet you can guess what kind of restaurant it is just by the name:<br /><br />New Dragon<br />La Pequena Colombia<br />Bamonte&#039;s<br />Doughnut Plant<br /><br />Do you see what I&#039;m getting at here? When you hear the name &quot;Laly&#039;s&quot; do you think of a restaurant that is serving a steak frites and kale salad? <br /><br />As far as the food served at the Queensboro. The pasta, shishito peppers, etc is served at bistro style restaurants all over NYC. They did not make that up. And the popcorn chaat is them trying to show they are influenced by the neighborhood. <br /><br />And if they want to do Tex-Mex, fine. But that&#039;s a separate thing and different from &quot;American and Mexican food.&quot; They can do what they want but I think some, if not all of my suggestions would help them succeed.<br /><br />Why do you think they don&#039;t have more business?

				The implication seems to be that restaurants should stay in a narrow lane and not innovate.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; El Rico Tinto was beloved precisely because it added an innovative spin on traditional dishes.&nbsp; And they expanded on the traditional offerings with excellent burgers, salads, and vegetarian options.<br /><br />Laly&#039;s seems to be aiming for a similar mix, although with a bit less flair than El Rico Tinto.&nbsp; I think that once people catch on, Laly&#039;s will do quite well.&nbsp; Personally, it took me quite a while just to walk in the door, due to my visceral aversion to McDonald&#039;s.

				We&#039;ve been to Laly&#039;s twice in recent weeks. I highly recommend the cemita burger, which I ordered both times. My wife first tried the chicken quesadilla and the fish tacos next; both were solid choices though she preferred the fish tacos. <br /><br />For apps, the houses salad was fresh and generously sized, and the Mexican street corn (esquites) was super tasty. <br /><br />The service was excellent: The gentleman who helped us both visits was friendly and professional. We plan on returning sometime soon to try the steak tacos.

				So I finally tried a dish at Laly&#039;s and I had the chicken quesadillas and I found them to be good, nothing out of this world but still yummy. I don&#039;t know why people are so concerned with the name and whether it sounds American or Mexican - if the food and service are good, would you really stop going cause of the name Laly&#039;s? Honestly, my only concern is that the menu is out of my price range. With so many mexican food options, I can find a more affordable chicken quesadilla that is yummie. The other day I wanted to order a Kale salad for delivery the other day and when I looked at Laly&#039;s as an option, I would have had to pay over $20 for a kale salad with added chicken to be delivered. I&#039;m sure their rent is very high so their prices might be influenced by that, but personally I cannot afford to pay that much for a salad.

				My little heart wants every small business to flourish, so I know I&#039;m rooting for these guys and may see everything in a rosy light.<br /><br />Disclaimer aside, I had some rad chilaquiles at Laly&#039;s this morning for breakfast. Sunnyside eggs on a high pile of chips with tomatillo sauce, chicken, avocado, cotija cheese, red onion. Added some of their morita hot sauce for a smoky kick. I&#039;ve also gotten salads and their tortilla soup on other nights. Feel like this place fills a need in the neighborhood for well-executed and satisfying meals that are not super ambitious nor super expensive but still tasty and prepared with fresh ingredients and care.

				Just want to put in another good word for Laly&#039;s. It has become our go-to place for delivery on weekday nights when we are too busy to cook. I&#039;d estimate we&#039;ve ordered from them about ten times. The food is always warm when it arrives, despite the fact that we live a distance away (85th/35th). It is delivered promptly and is carefully packed/packaged. The owner, who usually delivers the food, is very friendly. And most importantly, the food is delicious! It is made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and is always perfectly cooked and seasoned.

				I finally tried this place. I got the Laly&#039;s burger and I was really impressed. It was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. The fries that came with it were really good as well. I liked it much better than Emoji Burger which I think relies on the toppings too much. I&#039;ll definitely be back. My only complaint was the pickle - too sweet for me, but it did seem fresh. I got my order to go and it came neatly packed.<br /><br />The place was empty on a Saturday night around 7. One of the people working there mentioned that they will be getting their liquor license soon, which should help. If the rest of the food is as good as the burger, this place should be packed. The problem is definitely not the location. The interior is nice too.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It&#039;s great to see a chain close (McDonald&#039;s) to be replaced by a local business and not the other way around. If you haven&#039;t tried this restaurant yet, you should. It&#039;s the best burger I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood.

				Re: prices--it&#039;s not a deli or a coffee shop and you can&#039;t compare the prices to what a breakfast sandwich costs at a deli. I often order grilled salmon from Ricky&#039;s, which basically is a coffee shop, and it&#039;s $16.00 served with either salad, pasta, or vegetables. Laly&#039;s serves salmon with red quinoa, roasted beets, and kale pesto sauce. It&#039;s a bit fancier and more upscale, hence the price difference. I also get salmon with rice and veggies from Just Made 4 U--I think it&#039;s also around $16 and again, more basic ingredients than at Laly&#039;s. I like them all, by the way. But you don&#039;t get quinoa at Ricky&#039;s or Just Made 4 U.

				Laly&#039;s burgers range from $13 to $15. That&#039;s on par with Bareburger, which is my go-to place for a burger. Theirs are $11 to $15, with $11 getting you something quite basic. <br /><br />

				We finally had a chance to eat-in at Laly&#039;s last week. I had the burger and it was excellent. The fries were even more delicious! It&#039;s hard to imagine it&#039;s possible to get such a high-quality burger and those fries (!) anywhere else close-by.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t eaten anything from Jax Inn or Bareburger in a while so couldn&#039;t compare with theirs, but I have had my share of Emoji burgers and there is no comparison. (And I enjoy them.)&nbsp; Plus, an Emoji burger and fries start at around $10 and go up from there, so I think Laly&#039;s prices are quite reasonable and well worth it for the quality.<br /><br />We&#039;ve also had delivery from Laly&#039;s a couple of times and every dish we&#039;ve had has been consistently good.<br /><br />I really want them to succeed and hope they get a liquor license soon as I&#039;m sure that will help them quite a bit!

				I sincerely think people ought to try the food rather than write it off based on price alone. Laly’s is not a diner. I wouldn’t compare it to one.<br /><br />That said, I strongly encourage people to go and dine in. The Seamless prices aren’t the fine-in prices. They, like some other restaurants, try to offset the cut Seamless takes by upping the prices. You can also just call Laly’s directly and place an order. That aside I encourage all to go just to be there and show support. They need butts in seats. Really don’t want to see this place quietly go under. Especially when they’re so good.

				Not sure what all the complaining is about, the prices are reasonable and their burger quality is superior to Emoji (which I find greasy) and the diners in the neighborhood. Call directly for delivery--I have called 3 times and it has been very reliable and packed well.&nbsp; it&#039;s a great addition to restaurant options in neighborhood.

				Have you seen the prices at Jax Diner lately? That place is pretty expensive, and it&#039;s clearly a diner. I think with Laly&#039;s it&#039;s the combination of the location, which has never housed the sort of place it aims to be, and yes, the look of the place. It&#039;s not bad-looking, it just doesn&#039;t have a look that matches the menu in any way. It looks similar to Ricky&#039;s, so it comes across as a diner, although it is not. Plus the lack of a liquor license? It&#039;s really too bad--I go by there often and it always looks nearly empty. <br /><br />But you know, the location on Roosevelt is not necessarily a bar to &quot;people from the historic district&quot; patronizing a restaurant. Himalayan Yak is over there, and I think that place is pretty popular, and the Korean chicken place is also on Roosevelt and people seem to like that. And there are a number of places further west on Roosevelt or very near--Sri Pha Phai or however you spell that, and a few other places whose names I can&#039;t recall that are either on or right near Roosevelt--that are popular and even pretty upscale. The place I am thinking of is in Woodside and is small, very nice, and really high priced.<br /><br />So all in all, I think it&#039;s more the look of Laly&#039;s that doesn&#039;t match the food that may be the biggest drawback.

				Agreed that there is something lacking in the ambience. Could they make the place a little less of a fishbowl? This is another<br />deterrent when there are fewer customers in that some people equate a busy restaurant with a good restaurant.

				ah, abc et al., you wear me out. Laly&#039;s is a diner. It sells burgers and pancakes. Even Denny&#039;s has a steak plate and Hispanic fare. I don&#039;t know why you write that decor is important to you when rico tinto had barely a nice decor; a nice mirror and wall hanging, but kinda dark. I hated sitting in the back by the kitchen/toilet. The fishbowl comment has me scratching my head. Laly&#039;s is comparatively spacious. Maybe sit at a table, not a booth? Or vice-versa if the light/windows bother you? I am comfortable at Laly&#039;s. Their burger and fries is 11 or 12 dollars, a competitive price for a combo at any diner these days. Salads are overpriced everywhere.<br /><br />I agree with hum. There is a portion of our population that just isn&#039;t comfortable on Roosie (ok, Rosie). I&#039;m not prepared to call it a prejudice per se, but it is an unfamiliar environment for many. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard that Americans sometimes feel like they are in a foreign country. This is that.<br /><br />Laly&#039;s could do some advertising within the district to invite more folks to venture there, and per hfm, at the train station to grab in transits, but I fear the location will be their undoing.

				Re: location--there is a place on Roosevelt in Woodside called La Rosa or something like that? Is that still there? Anyway, it is very similar in a way to Laly&#039;s--very good food, but right on Roosevelt and near a set of stairs to the 7, I think, and all glass walls. I remember liking the food but finding the ambiance--you pretty much felt like you were sitting on Roosevelt right under the 7 train--a bit unpleasant. And I recall thinking that if there were drapes, or just walls with some sort of cozy interior decor, I would enjoy sitting there more. It&#039;s not a pretty view, you have to admit. But that place seemed to be popular and successful in spite of the location and glass walls.<br /><br />And I have to disagree with the idea that Laly&#039;s is a diner--it most definitely does not have a classic diner menu, and the quality is a step above most diners (not all--some diners are outstanding). At what other diner do you get kale pesto and red quinoa with your filet of salmon? That&#039;s how it&#039;s served at Laly&#039;s. Seriously, just because it serves burgers and pancakes does not mean it&#039;s a diner.

				Wow. Definitely some insufferable people in here. It&#039;s good food, the prices are fair, staff is super friendly.. what else do you need? I really like it. Definitely adds to the neighborhood options in a positive way. Is it perfect, of course not nothing is. Is it damn good? Yeah.

				Decor doesn&#039;t have to be expensive to be great.<br /><br />It just needs creativity and personality.<br /><br />Eating out is a total experience.&nbsp; food + ambience.<br /><br />At the moment, that place looks like it should be serving porridge.&nbsp; The look of the place doesn&#039;t match the creativity of the food, obviously.<br /><br />But it should, to attract folks and passer-bys.&nbsp; The Brazilian joint manages to look enticing. That&#039;s on &quot;Roosie&quot; not far. I go to the Brazilian place because it looks appealing.&nbsp; And the food is good. Plus the prices are fine. Phayul is a tiny place where the decor is great cause you feel like you&#039;re in a Tibetan person&#039;s kitchen. It&#039;s unique. Plus the momos are good. <br /><br />Prepared delicious food should look special.<br /><br />So should the venue! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				You only need decor if you are going to charge a higher price and serve Steak Frite and Quinoa.<br /><br />---&gt; The decor has to match the menu and vibe. &lt;---<br /><br />Lali Guras across the street and Coatzingo around the corner do not look that nice inside and that is part of their vibe.

				The negative comments on this post are basically asking this place to cancel their current lease, find another location that doesn&#039;t cost 20k a month, and hire a Manhattan design firm so that you can possibly, just possibly, feel comfortable eating there. And then you&#039;ll complain about the price of the food going up. Maybe you&#039;re not the best customer base to seek out. In the meantime, I&#039;ll keep talking it up.&nbsp; <br /><br />If Roosevelt is seriously too worrisome for people, it&#039;s easy enough to walk down 76th Street from 37th Avenue.

				Have to weigh in with all the odd posts here on the decor.&nbsp; For me food and service outweighs decor, and comparable to most places in JH this is more comfortable. A few pluses for not having large TVs and neon lighting.&nbsp; I like that the windows mostly face 76th street and you do not get too much noise or view of Roosevelt...&nbsp; Agree, they can make some adjustments to decor to add warmth, but that is hardly a deterrent.&nbsp; Menu is pretty simple, so the decor does not need to be white table cloths (I think Romeo&#039;s the new Italian has that) and it isn&#039;t trying to be a trendy Brooklyn restaurant (Queensboro is trying to be that).&nbsp; I think that business will pick up with the bar--many people like to drink with Mexican food.

They appeal to people who are looking for low-priced food from their home-country, and also to foodies (like me) who are looking for exotic and authentic food. <br /><br />Laly&#039;s does not qualify because it is none of those things. It isn&#039;t low-priced (at least not as low as Phayul, Kababish, Lali Guras, etc), it has few authentic Mexican dishes and it&#039;s not exotic enough to attract foodies.<br /><br />I think families and young professionals are their target demo so they should do their best to either make it into either a quick and easy take out spot (like Emoji Burger or Just Made 4 U) or a comfortable family/date night restaurant.

				Yes.<br /><br />At the moment, Laly&#039;s restaurant has no defining personality. Personality is a form of ambiance.<br /><br />Now it&#039;s kinda bland.

				As predicted, the acquisition of the liquior license has helped quite a bit. I passed by and there were quite a few people at the bar and more eating than normal, and it was pretty early in the evening. <br /><br />All this hyperbole about the decor and location is just that, hyperbole. It&#039;s definitely over-the-top.

				We also tried Laly&#039;s -- twice in the past week. And while the food is incredible, I just can&#039;t keep paying prices that are $5 or $5 more than the average restaurant in Queens. <br /><br />We ordered a chicken quesadilla and it came with nothing but it still cost $13! That&#039;s outrageous. We also ordered tres leches cake which was also very tasty but at $8/slice for half of what you get at other places, it seems like a rip off.

				I went to Lally&#039;s and the prices seem about right considering the quality of the food.&nbsp; Everything is fresh and well made.&nbsp; Other places are cheaper, but sometimes you have to pay a bit more for quality and/or ambiance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my dining bills have gone up slightly ever since Lally&#039;s acquired its liquor license - I am halfheartedly complaining.&nbsp; In fact, I am planning on increasing Lally&#039;s rotation on my list of restaurants.&nbsp; <br /><br />My spouse, however, has complained about the windows and the sense that there is no privacy.&nbsp; I think it would be nice if they put some kind of art and/or decorations that would give diners a sense of privacy and also give the restaurant more of a personality, both on the inside and outside - depending on the art and/or decorations.&nbsp;

				<br />Ate at Lalys this weekend , I like to judge a restaurant by the simply things, for example, their grilled chicken sandwich is outstanding...... it obviously starts with very fresh ingredients. Glad to see they had a good sunday lunch crowd.

				Had a wonderful meal there on Saturday Jan 26. Booths were filled, service was good, shrimp enchilada delicious. When we find a good find we have to support it &amp; keep it going! I was a fan of Zaytoun and think they would have survived if more people knew about them.

				I also think Laly&#039;s would benefit from having some kind of window treatment. Roosevelt Avenue is not visually appealing as it has a dark and dirty feel to it.&nbsp; Not appetizing. Aroma Brazil does a brisk business and it is on Roosevelt but when one eats in there Roosevelt Avenue is &quot;far away&quot;.&nbsp; I too was sorry to see Zaytoun close.&nbsp; I think it was in the wrong location and their timing was bad.&nbsp; If Target was there; more foot traffic and potential customers.&nbsp; He might do better on Northern Blvd or Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp;

				I stopped into Laly&#039;s yesterday on the way home from Manhattan. I ordered the breakfast special,which was $11.00. I got two somewhat greasy over-easy eggs, some tasty hash browns, two strips of bacon, also a little greasy, exactly one piece of toast, and a small cup of coffee for which i was charged $2.50, I later discovered. The butter that came on the side for the toast was pretty well frozen, and it was accompanied by the usual grape jelly. The final bill was $14.70 and I left a tip. So in the end, I felt that i was charged nearly $20 for a basic diner breakfast. <br /><br />I&#039;m afraid that I won&#039;t go back in the hurry. Yes, they were busy, which is great. And the service was friendly. But nothing in the meal justified the cost. Somehow the charge for the coffee galled me the most.

				those prices are fairly typical, but free coffee as part of a breakfast special is implied in the contract of being a new yorker. an upcharge is off base.

				Not that you don’t have a right to be satisfied with what you got, but I wouldn’t have gotten such a basic breakfast there. They really excel at their non-diner dishes. Because...well, they’re not a diner.

				I fully understand that restaurants have enormous overhead and must charge what they charge to survive.&nbsp; However, I can&#039;t imagine spending $20 for breakfast.&nbsp; The last time that I had a meal at a restaurant was in January 2016 when I took someone to Okawa Restaurant for their birthday.&nbsp; I prefer preparing my own meals which gives me control over the quality of the ingredients, how its prepared and how its seasoned (I never use salt).&nbsp; With an annual six figure income and a significant net worth its not about saving money.&nbsp; I have the same breakfast every morning which is fresh made carrot &amp; beet juice, oatmeal with blueberries and coffee for $1.60. <br />I realize that I&#039;m very bad for the local economy but I enjoy preparing meals and dining at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				A restaurant voyeur, possibly--and one who can calculate the exact cost of his/her homemade breakfast, to boot. If you need to avoid salt, I guess it really is best to stay out of restaurants.&nbsp; For me, eating out is entertainment and a social event and a way to avoid drudgery/too many dishes to wash. It gives me more than just the meal, so I consider it worth the price.
