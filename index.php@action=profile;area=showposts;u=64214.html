					So, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17961.msg87599#msg87599">Quote from: am315 on July 19, 2018, 09:31:51 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The bigger questions that have been lost in all the glowing press about Ocasio-Cortez&#039;s win are: What kind of Congresswoman will she be and what will she achieve given her views?<br /><br />Ocasio-Cortez isn&#039;t just a progressive. She has a pretty far left agenda that calls for policies such as Medicare coverage for all. Not one iota of what she ran on will ever come to the fore as legislation. So aside from being a foil for the Republicans what will she do? Will she back more moderate legislation and issues that really mean something to her constituents?<br /><br />Anyone have any insights? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The majority of Democrats support Medicare for All -- including Joe Crowley. Medicare for All is already legislation, and has 122 co-sponsors. What&#039;s possible in politics is changing beneath our feet:<br /><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/07/20/medicare-all-caucuses-launched-congressional-democrats/803725002/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/07/20/medicare-all-caucuses-launched-congressional-democrats/803725002/</a><br /><br />I&#039;m certain she&#039;s an automatic yes vote on 99.9% of democratic initiatives. My goal is that she can add credence to progressive proposals &amp; shift the Overton window to the left.<br /><br />As a local leader now, I&#039;d also be happy if she spearheads progressive pushes on the local level too, and to do that she needs a progressive working group. I think that&#039;s happening - I&#039;ve personally been asked to sign ballot petitions for folks running for County Committee that are native to the area, but worked on her campaign. That&#039;s **awesome**.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17961.msg87603#msg87603">Quote from: JH3525 on July 19, 2018, 10:05:21 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It appears that Rep Crowley is on the November Ballot even though he is not actively campaigning,&nbsp; Since he is so well known and respected is it possible that he could win?&nbsp; I believe that just 13% voted in the June Primary but significantly more will vote in November who don&#039;t endorse Ms. Ocasio-Cortez views. I&#039;m sure others besides&nbsp; Joe Lieberman will endorse Rep Crowley before the election.&nbsp; Again, can Rep Crowley win?&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Anything&#039;s possible, but Crowley&#039;s thrown his support behind the nominee. Remember: he was adament that he would support her if she won. For him not to do so would be the height of hypocracy.<br />

He is, by no means, perfect.&nbsp; Here was his explanation in the NY Times, for what it&#039;s worth: &quot;<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">&quot;Mr. Crowley, in a statement, said his vote in favor of the bill was not related to Wall Street donations, but a desire to fund other important government programs. “I do not support jamming controversial provisions in at the last minute that are completely unrelated to the business of funding the government,” the statement said.&quot;</div><br />The comment about New Visions was in response to earlier posts noting their vote to endorse Crowley. I was just trying to give some background.&nbsp; I am glad Dromm and her campaign are not feuding now. Waste of energy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry about the &#039;weird post&#039; comment. I should drink my coffee before posting. That was rude of me.<br /><br />His explanation is a poor one - &quot;I didn&#039;t make the decision because of the money I just received from the people who benefit from my decision&quot;. I&#039;d imagine there are plenty of examples of Crowley inserting last-minute provisions into bills.<br /><br />Totally agree with your last paragraph

They actually threatened to picket one of the meetings. She sent out some nasty tweets about him.&nbsp; Apparently some of this is very personal and I&#039;m sure she has explanations, but it does show she has not been very smart about local politics.

Crowley has the honor as the Democrat who received the most money from Wall Street to initiate changes in the bill.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.<br /><br />June 19, 2018<br /><br />When asking New Yorkers for their vote, most candidates would begin by showing up.<br /><br />Not Representative Joseph Crowley. No, Mr. Crowley, a 10-term Democratic congressman who reportedly has ambitions of serving as House speaker, chose to skip a debate Monday night with his primary challenger, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He sent a surrogate instead, former City Councilwoman Annabel Palma.<br /><br />This is the second primary debate in which Mr. Crowley was a no-show. A spokeswoman for Mr. Crowley said he had scheduling conflicts that wouldn’t allow him to attend the two debates, inevitably leaving voters to wonder — what are we, chopped liver?<br /><br />Indeed, the snubs should be galling not only to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Crowley’s constituents in New York’s 14th Congressional District, in Queens and the Bronx, but also to anyone who cares about the democratic process.<br /><br />Mr. Crowley, 56, is a powerful congressman who leads the Queens County Democratic Party. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, has presented him his first major primary challenge in years. Despite long odds, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, has garnered significant support, waging a high-energy campaign and positioning herself as a grass-roots alternative to Mr. Crowley.<br /><br />The candidates have met once, in a Spectrum News NY1 debate last week at which both candidates held their own.<br /><br />Instead of attending Monday evening’s debate, which was hosted by The Parkchester Times, Mr. Crowley visited a civic association meeting in Queens. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was left to debate Mr. Crowley’s chosen surrogate, Ms. Palma. Ms. Palma once represented the Bronx on the City Council and now serves in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration as a deputy commissioner at the Department of Social Services.<br /><br />Mr. Crowley’s constituents might well now wonder whether he intends, if re-elected, to have Ms. Palma make his floor speeches and cast his votes as well.<br /><br />Crowley aides said they had told the newspaper weeks ago that there was a scheduling conflict and had asked to change the event. The publisher of The Parkchester Times said he had no idea that Mr. Crowley wouldn’t attend.<br /><br />Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter after the debate that in sending Ms. Palma, Mr. Crowley chose “a woman with slight resemblance to me” as his surrogate. Both Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Palma are Latina. Crowley aides dispute that Mr. Crowley chose Ms. Palma because of her ethnicity. A campaign spokesman, Vijay Chaudhuri, said Ms. Palma was chosen because she is a “phenomenal local leader.”<br /><br />Mr. Crowley is far from the first candidate to decline to debate a challenger he is heavily favored to beat. But as a longtime incumbent with a powerful role as a party leader, he should relish, not shirk, a chance to make his case to voters. Mr. Crowley has decades of experience that can serve his constituents well in Congress. But his seat is not his entitlement. He’d better hope that voters don’t react to his snubs by sending someone else to do the job.<br /><br />Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt="&#58;o" title="Shocked" class="smiley" /> what an article. Tells you where his priorities are. I never thought a sitting Congressman would play hooky for one debate, let alone 2?

But what if she wins? Do those same groups decide what she does once in office? That&#039;s not really the job. She also didn&#039;t really answer the question about other pacs that she works with. It&#039;s not like those groups don&#039;t lobby politicians...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I had the same reaction (said as much in my earlier post) -- but after reflecting on it a bit, I think that question might ring differently to her than it does to you or me, judging on her answer.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I think she was thinking: &quot;I can&#039;t in good conscious stand for a candidate that has <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/05/18/the-queens-machine-that-turns-foreclosures-into-cash/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">enriched himself &amp; his family/ friends</a> off of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/06/14/joe-crowley-congress-new-york/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">foreclosures and lobbying</a>. That said, this is also a Democracy, and I am representative of the people&#039;s wishes, not the other way around - and so my endorsement will reflect the will of the people whom have lifted me to this point.&quot;<br /><br />IMO, in this day and age, what this country needs on both sides, is the political courage to stand not just with your tribe, but for what&#039;s right. Republicans in Congress have chosen to enable Trump again &amp; again because he&#039;s got the R next to our name. We ask them to stand up to him, stand for the values our country has stood for, but what good is that request if we can&#039;t do the same? <br /><br />Speaking of endorsements -- MoveOn just endorsed her.

He&#039;s accumulated a lot of power and doesn&#039;t have much to show for it. Queens may have diversity among their candidates but, the sound &quot;meh&quot; rings in my head when I think of them. For me it&#039;s a question of what good is trying to gather more influence when you don&#039;t really have a vision or even a few bills that you&#039;ve written over that lengthy period of time. It&#039;s like just for the sake of it?<br /><br />There is definitely a &quot;Bernie or bust&quot; thing brewing here. She has been HEAVILY promoted by all the media sources loved by the further left activist types. It&#039;s helped her stay competitive (which is great for democracy). However, that&#039;s an issue because they don&#039;t live in Dist-14. It&#039;s a campaign that has largely targeted younger people (who don&#039;t always vote) and ignored older residents (who are active and regular voters). The older folks are VERY loyal to Crowley. It&#039;s easy to see all her supporters crying foul if it doesn&#039;t pan out. <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to seem rude but, if you don&#039;t know much about Crowley you just haven&#039;t been paying attention. That guy shows up everywhere around here. He holds town halls not just in JH but, East Elmhurst and Corona. If he&#039;s not doing that he is on TV fairly regularly too. <br /><br />To me, that comment (not knowing him) speaks to the problem we face. Mass disengagement. Lefty hero Noam Chomsky himself said that the left &quot;collapsed&quot; during the Obama years. If you don&#039;t know who your reps are then that&#039;s cause you are not interested. Reading the news is just a form of entertainment at it&#039;s core. <br /><br />Ocasio&#039;s campaign is somewhat of a reflection of that. I&#039;m not sure SHE new much about Crowley before this. In my experience, activist culture has a problem with leadership because everything must be decentralized and wholly democratic. Imagine if there were individuals that actually ran after Occupy with the support and organization that they had. Politicians would die for that. This is exactly what happened to the student movement during Vietnam, they got bored and went to sleep ushering in the Reagan era. The Hamster wheel is coming around again....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You don&#039;t sound rude at all! I made the mistake of exaggerating my last sentence - I&#039;ve seen him on Sunday television &amp; have sent his office a significant amount of correspondence about one issue or another for the last couple of years. I&#039;m aware of him as our congressperson, and certainliy aware of his standing in local &amp; national politics, but I haven&#039;t seen the benefits to our district as a result.<br /><br />On activist culture&#039;s disdain for leadership &amp; &quot;Bernie or Bust&quot; -- it would seem that both of those ideas are idametrically opposed from one another, right? You can&#039;t be disdainful for leadership, while simultaneously putting all of your eggs in the basket of a single person. Occupy certainly was distrustful of leadership, but this new blend of liberal activism (Parkland Kids, Black Lives Matter, Bernie people) don&#039;t seem to have that problem.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. Crowley isn&#039;t some great evil, but as you said, he&#039;s accumulated a lot of power &amp; doesn&#039;t have much to show for it. It&#039;s been 20 years, and Crowley has had a long career. Whomever wins I&#039;ll no doubt vote for the Democrat, but having a driven, intelligent, unapolegically progressive &amp; energized person to represent &amp; fight for our incredibly unique district in Ocasio-Cortez is something I really look forward to.

Ocasio was prepared (which I expected). But, also more polished than expected. Which was cool. Crowley definitely winged it. He&#039;s on TV often and this didn&#039;t seem like his greatest appearance. They each lied about something. Crowley about board approval for the Target condos, Ocasio for her response on a Reddit thread where she said she does not believe in federal laws the for guns. Meaning each state should decide for themselves. For me that was disappointing because she tried to make a fool of him and say he trolls reddit but, it came right from an ask me anything session she participated in. <br /><br />The response online was overwhelmingly boosting her but, very oddly from people outside the district and even the state! Like who watches inside city hall in Detroit or California. A lot of twitter profiles from elsewhere repeatedly posted about her. Weird....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I checked the AMA - here&#039;s the link:<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/6ftvhu/hey_reddit_i_am_alexandria_ocasiocortez_us/dikxy1u/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/6ftvhu/hey_reddit_i_am_alexandria_ocasiocortez_us/dikxy1u/</a><br /><br />The impression that Joe Crowley tried to pass off (to me at least) was that she&#039;s against gun reform on the national level. But her exact words from the AMA are &quot;I happen to support NYC&#039;s more strict take on gun control. But I also believe that there needs to be flexibility on the national level&quot;.<br /><br />Flexibility =/= &quot;I don&#039;t believe in federal gun laws&quot; in my eyes. It reads more like &quot;there should be more gun laws, and they&#039;ll probably be different in different states. Because it&#039;s a Democracy&quot;.<br /><br />Re: Twitter -- that&#039;s not surprising. She&#039;s had a ton of media attention in the last couple of weeks, mainly becuase she&#039;s very intelligent, grew up in the district, has liberal cred (protested at Standing Rock), and is unapolegitcally progressive + going up against one of the most powerful politicians in New York. She&#039;s the kind of Democrat that a lot of people want to see more of.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how I felt: I through Crowley did better in the debate itself, but nothing about his performance motivates me to get up &amp; vote for him - he&#039;s still a &#039;par-the-course&#039; candidate &amp; my feelings aren&#039;t particularly strong for him, nor did he give me a reason apart from &quot;Donald Trump is bad&quot; and &quot;Democrats are good&quot;. His performance doesn&#039;t motivate me towards action on election day. Crowley really should be winning this given that he&#039;s been here for 20 years...but I&#039;ve honestly never really knew much about him until this race, which says a lot considering the amount of news I read.<br /><br />Alexandria was energetic, **really** knows the issues, spoke to my pains &amp; made the choice very clear. She gave one answer that I didn&#039;t like: the &#039;unity&#039; answer. Alexandria&#039;s is fiercly against a lot of what Crowley has benefitted from (massive donations, a lot from the same folks that donate to Trump), but people will be reminded of the &quot;Bernie or Bust&quot; stuff, which pissed off a lot of Democrats in 2016. That&#039;ll almost certainly turn off some Democrats; whomever thought of that question is a mad genius. <br /><br />But, she&#039;s very clearly an organizing force, and she reflects my feelings towards politics on the local &amp; national levels -- nothing&#039;s getting better. Crowley has accumulated all this power locally (head of the Queens Democratic Caucus, makes &amp; breaks candidacies) but the achievements he tauts are on the national level (voted for ObamaCare, voted for Dodd Frank, etc). He&#039;s had 20 years to make more of a direct impact in the community, and yet before this election I&#039;ve never heard of him.
