				Hey guys – <br />My family and I moved to JH a little over 2 years ago. Before that I had a band in Philly, but making that work long distance has been pretty much impossible. I am a singer/songwriter/rhythm guitarist looking for like minded musicians in the area. I am heavily indebted to all those obsessed with loud guitars and catchy hooks – think Neil Young, Replacements, Matthew Sweet, Cheap Trick, etc.<br />I’m looking to practice a few times a month, work on songs, and play the occasional show. If you are interested, feel free to see me a private message here.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />-Sal<br /><br />Some links:<br /><br />The Thirteen (my old band in Philly – did a couple LP’s):<br />https://thethirteen.bandcamp.com/<br /><br />New ‘solo’ record recorded with Pete Donnelly (The Figgs):&nbsp; <br />https://salcannestra.bandcamp.com/releases<br />

				I don&#039;t know if I have the time to commit to a band project at present but if you need folks to jam/get started/keep loose, I play gtr and bass.

				I&#039;m playing in two bands, and have a job I need to keep and a marriage to maintain so I&#039;m pretty sure I can&#039;t get away with joining another full time band right now. <br /><br />That said, it sounds like you&#039;re right up my alley. I&#039;d definitely like to hang; if you wanted to do a guys-with-guitars thing at Espresso 77 I&#039;m sure we could cobble something together. <br /><br />And once you DO get a band pulled together, I&#039;m trying to build a guitar-pop-mafia of like minded bands to build some kind of *ahem cough* scene and develop a mutual fanbase. <br /><br />Here&#039;s my main thang: https://thejamesrocket.bandcamp.com<br /><br />Let&#039;s drink coffee abusively and talk about the scene, maan.<br /><br />

				Thank you guys! I apologize for the late response. I kinda thought I&#039;d get an e-mail telling me if someone responded, but I can&#039;t say why I thought that as this is first thing I&#039;ve ever posted here.&nbsp; ;)<br />I will be in touch.
