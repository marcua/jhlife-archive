				<strong>I try not to assign a designated direction or whatever to the event.... The only direction is that, to start, we we cross 31st Ave and head up 76th Street. From there, the group decides on the direction. Pretty much, we head towards houses or streets with Xmas lights. <br /><br />If you get there a little after 6pm, try checking at CURVES inside the Shopping Center, as the group may still be over there having our pre-sing warm up beverages. <br /><br />Looking forward to a big turn-out tomorrow,<br />ARIA</strong>
