				Hi,<br /><br />My husband and I have been thinking about relocating to JH from Brooklyn for a long time.&nbsp; We now have an 18 month old daughter and are thinking about it even more.&nbsp; In terms of apartments, we are looking to buy with a moderate budget.&nbsp; We are aware of the lack of green space and parks in the area. For you parents out there, how important is it to have a garden in your building?&nbsp; Our kid is very active and busy.&nbsp; Any thoughts would be most appreciated.

				I&#039;ll make the assumption that since you have a young daughter and have an interest in a building with a garden, that you are therefore:<br /><br />Looking for a building with a garden, and the building(s) also allows your daughter to run around on the grass.<br /><br />Two buildings that I&#039;m a bit familiar with:<br /><br />1.) Hawthorne Court - 35-13 to 35-55 76th Street; 35-14 to 35-58 77th Street (Between 35th Avenue and 37th Avenue) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe these buildings explicity FORBID anyone from walking on the grass in the center, i.e. no blankets permitted, no sitting on the grass, etc.&nbsp; You may run/jog on the gravel path on the perimeter, but &quot;Stay off the lawn!&quot;.&nbsp; That was what I was told several years ago by someone who lives there.&nbsp; It may have changed since then, perhaps someone who knows for sure can verify this.<br /><br />2.) Hampton Court - 78th and 79th Street (Between 35th Avenue and 37th Avenue) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These buildings allow you to walk on the grass, place a blanket on the grass, have a picnic, children may run around.&nbsp; <br />

				A lot of the gardens are like old fashioned living rooms: look pretty but don&#039;t sit on the sofa!&nbsp; Definitely ask when you go to different buildings if the residents and their children play in the gardens.&nbsp; There are also some buildings without green gardens to play in but they have playgrounds for their resident&#039;s children.&nbsp; Roosevelt Terraces I think do and Saxony Towers also.&nbsp; These are fenced in areas where children ride their tricycles and play together usually on cement.

				I agree, based on my unscientific observations during the summer garden tours where they open up like 10 private gardens (this year&#039;s tours just passed).&nbsp; I noticed only one place where there were people on the grass.&nbsp; It may have been Hampton Court.&nbsp;

				I have heard the Dunnolly has a &quot;well-used&quot; garden that is an entire block long.&nbsp; I assumed this to mean that people are out and about, barbecuing and reading and playing.&nbsp; But I must admit I did not ask for details about what &quot;well-used&quot; might mean, so take this comment for what it&#039;s worth.

				I&#039;m in the Griswold and our building is on a block end and does not have an enclosed &quot;courtyard&quot; garden. But there is private space behind the building that our Garden Committee had been doing a lot of work in (especially this year) and is used. The only barbecues are &#039;officially sanctioned&quot; ones that are put on by the Board, but there are places to sit and read or take your kids etc.

				My recollection of Dunnolly when I was looking to buy is that it is more of a concrete yard with trees and benches around the trees.&nbsp; &nbsp;There may have been bushes by the entrances to each of the wings.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t see any grassy areas.

				Most of the gardens in the area are pretty and for quiet activities; sitting a reading a book. The last garden tour I went on, I also noticed that there were only a few that had any grass and even less that allowed anyone to enjoy that grass and sit on it. It&#039;s a shame.<br /><br />So, if you want to get a place with a garden, be sure to ask to see the House Rules about the garden and what activities you are allowed to engage in. Chances are that you can&#039;t just let your kids roam around in it unattended.

				Roosevelt Terrace is very affordable.&nbsp; It is a post-war complex with affordable apartments, low maintenance (includes electricity), garage and large enclosed play area for children.&nbsp; I would absolutely look there.&nbsp; Also, another tip, if you have a modest budget I think you can absolutely get more bang for your buck up in the 80s where I live.&nbsp; That is what we chose to do.&nbsp; It is quieter but still close to everything, we are very happy here. Good luck!
