				Sad to hear that Jackson Heights born Don Rickles passed.<br /><br />He left Jackson Heights long before I was born, but when you look up celebrities from Jackson Heights he was on the list.

				He lived in an apartment house at 89-09 32nd Ave., across the street from P.S. 148, according to a 2015 article in The Wall Street Journal.

				Only (soon to be celebrities) that I personally knew when I lived in Jackson Heights (left NY in 1977) were: 1.<strong> Academy Award Winner Mercedes Ruehl </strong>who I had a crush on when I was 6 and she was 10 (her mother taught at PS 69- and may have been my first grade teacher) and Mercedes would occasionally help out in the Classroom. My crush ended at 7 when she threatened to beat me up and somehow (I&#039;m not a stalker) remember the last time I ever talked to her when I went at the age of 12 or 13 to play basketball inside PS 69&nbsp; which was the first time a girl had ever &quot;flirted&quot; with me! Mercedes recognized me and I didn&#039;t immediately recognize her because I hadn&#039;t seen her for 5+ years. She came up to me and talked to me very sweetly for about 20 minutes and then said to me &quot;I bet you don&#039;t recognize who I am&quot; and after staring at her for about 14 seconds, embarrassed, shouted &quot;Mercedes&quot;. I asked her how come I never saw her after second grade and she told me she was going to some Drama School in Long Island. Like an idiot, I didn&#039;t realize that Mercedes Ruehl was the Mercedes I knew as a kid till I googled Jackson Heights on Wikipedia and had my Cosmic Revelation. Duh! <br />2.<strong> 2 of the NY Dolls, Johnny Thunders and Sylvain Sylvain.</strong> Johnny was more of a slight acquaintance at JHS 145 who once told me he admired my &quot;Semi Beatles Boots&quot;. Johnny played &quot;Walk Don&#039;t Run&quot; at the JHS talent show and was great. Sylvain Sylvain was in my 4th grade class at PS 69 with Mrs. Levy and I didn&#039;t like him and barely spoke to him. I was never a particular fan of the NY Dolls and/or punk rock.<br />4.<strong> Gene Simmons</strong> lived about 100 feet from my apartment building and even at 14 he looked like he does today which scared the hell out of me every time I passed him in the street. I think maybe we exchanged 10 words with his being &quot;F You&quot; for something. I never was into Kiss&#039;s music but I do find Gene Simmons entertaining and intelligent when I see him speak on TV today.

				I was a friend of and hung out with Johnny Thunders sister Maryann. He was just a kid at that time, but I remember when his sister got married he wasn&#039;t famous yet. Sad he was so imvolved with drugs
