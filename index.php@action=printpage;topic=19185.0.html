				According to the New York Post, CitiBike is planning a major expansion:<br /><br /><em>Maps obtained by The Post show that in the next three years, the bicycle-share program is going to double its geographic reach by placing docks in the Bronx and farther out into Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.<br /><br />By the end of 2023, new bike-share stations will pepper Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Sugar Hill, Washington Heights and Inwood in Manhattan; Mott Haven, Melrose, Port Morris, Highbridge, Claremont, Morrisania, Longwood, Concourse and Mount Eden in the Bronx; Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, East Flatbush, Sunset Park, South Slope, Windsor Terrace, Prospect Park South and Kensington in Brooklyn; and Sunnyside, Maspeth, <strong>Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Corona in Queens</strong>.<br /><br />The program, owned by Lyft, is forking over $100 million for the expansion. It will also add bikes to the existing coverage area, bringing the total size of the fleet to 40,000.</em><br /><br />Full story: <br />https://nypost.com/2019/07/15/citi-bike-looking-to-double-coverage-expand-to-the-bronx/

				This is great, but 2023 seems like quite a long time. Also, if we&#039;re getting bikes, we&#039;re going to need more and better bike lanes out here.

				It seems that this story probably will never happen because by then e bikes and e scooters will be all over Jackson Heights. People want a e bike not a regular heavy bike.

				I feel like protected bike lanes could be more dangerous for pedestrians. I prefer a mixture and everything slowing down

				let&#039;s get bike certification /licenses before adding more bike lanes or citibikes so we can also get revenue from all of the red lights that bikers run- traffic cameras should be for ANYTHING that has wheels.

Folks will use Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Corona and Flushing as their parking lots then jump on the subway into the city. Our idiot city council members of course don&#039;t have the foresight to know this will happen.

				Hopefully, all these difficulties will lead to private cars becoming a thing of the past, and folks will rent cars.<br /><br />And that&#039;ll be as ubiquitous as the Citibike program...
