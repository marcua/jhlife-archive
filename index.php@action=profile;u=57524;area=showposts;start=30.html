					I think people want the restaurant to succeed.&nbsp; However, this is NYC and the competition is fierce.&nbsp; Hopefully, the owners read this site and address some of the concerns raised.&nbsp; While I was disappointed the last time I went there, I am pretty sure I will go back because I am hoping things get better.&nbsp;

I would not go back unless the food improves. Why not get bread from Cannelle instead of using supermarket reject for the clam garlic bread? Why not figure out how to use an expensive brick oven you paid good money for so you can turn out better pizza? How could brick oven pizza not have a single blister? Why not figure out some pasta toppings that are more complementary in flavor? I know critical opinions of this place is in the minority on the boards but I’d love to return so hopefully you heed some of it. But then again I’m sure you’ll do well regardless. Starbucks has built a billion dollar coffee business on burnt coffee. There’s a market for food served at a comfortable setting and there’s a clear demand for that in JH. I don’t think it should detract from other perspectives though. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I was also disappointed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there twice.&nbsp; The wait staff seemed to lack experience based on the little things, e.g., waitress took my drink order and forgot about it until I reminded her like 15/20 minutes later, waiter asked one person at the table for drink order and that person declined and the waiter did not ask others for their drink orders, nobody asks if everything is ok after serving food, etc.<br /><br />Moreover, I ordered the steak and they sent two medium sized steaks that were significantly undercooked - I asked for them to be cooked medium.&nbsp; I sent them back and when they returned the food, one of the steaks was medium and the other was so burnt it was not edible.&nbsp; I mentioned it to the waiter and he saw exactly what happened.&nbsp; I still paid full price for the really poorly cooked steak.&nbsp; On another occasion, I had the burger and found it to be bland - almost as though there was no seasoning and even this was undercooked - I asked for medium.<br /><br />My advise to the owners is to hire a chef that knows how to cook.&nbsp; My guess is that the cook is not a trained cook.&nbsp; The cook is probably a dishwasher who hustled his way to a cooking position.&nbsp; As an aside, the pizza is mediocre.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best part of the restaurant is the beer selection and the ambiance, but I am afraid that if they do not replace the chef soon, people will stop going there.&nbsp; There are so many options in the neighborhood that serve excellent food and the fact that the chef can&#039;t even cook a steak is a bad harbinger for the restaurant&#039;s future.

					I call 311 anytime I have an issue in the neighborhood, e.g., old dudes sitting in front of my building drinking alcohol, parked car with loud music, issues with Travers Park, 18-wheeler blocking the street, etc.<br /><br />I think of it as helping out my neighbors who care about the neighborhood.&nbsp; As far as non-gentrifiers not calling 311/police for issues, for the most part apathetic neighbors are not good for the neighborhood to the extent that if people think that they can get away with anti-social behavior it will adversely impact all of us (who care).<br /><br />

					Offer to put two years worth of maintenance in escrow.&nbsp; This will address any underlying concern with regards to non-payment of maintenance/taxes.&nbsp; If that does not work, 2-years and a guarantor should do the trick.&nbsp; The escrow without the guarantor worked for someone I know.&nbsp; I think the key is for the purchaser to make the suggestion because there is no incentive for the coop to make the suggestion because it could lead to litigation.&nbsp;

					The best way to understand what issues are affecting the coop is to read the board minutes, run a search to see if there are any lawsuits pending, ask to see the financials so your accountant can take a look at them, and read the offering plan, bylaws, house rules, and proprietary lease; including any amendments. The reality is that most people will not be well versed on any of this stuff; hence, it is unlikely anybody will respond with any meaningful/substantive information.&nbsp; If you like the place, make an offer otherwise chances are you will never see these documents.&nbsp; If your offer is accepted, hire a lawyer who will arrange for you to have the opportunity to read the board minutes – I suggest going back at least 4 years.&nbsp; You can learn a lot, i.e., any problems associated with tenants, apartments, structural integrity of the building, lawsuits, liabilities, loans, etc.&nbsp; Moreover, hire a lawyer who read the corporate documents and go over them with you and explain what the nature of the relationship if you ultimately purchase the unit, i.e., you do not own the apartment and are a shareholder in a corporation that gives you the right to rent a particular unit. This will cost you more than the average RE lawyer because the average lawyer will not work that hard on individual cases because RE closings are generally a volume practice and most people do not ask questions.&nbsp; Moreover, the average RE lawyer in Queens do not charge much; hence their fee does not contemplate the aforementioned.&nbsp; In other words, a lot of lawyers who handle RE matters will not bill you much, but will literally show up at the closing and tell you where to sign.&nbsp; On the other hand, you can hire one of those cheap lawyers and read the documents yourself – this option will be a nightmare.&nbsp;

					All I can say is welcome to the neighborhood Target! I can&#039;t wait to take advantage of all the cost saving options that Target provides to anybody who has to work for living - that includes this guy!&nbsp; A little hint neighbors, if you say (phonetically) Tar-jay, it sounds a hell of a lot better than saying Target, e.g., excuse me sir, please pass the Grey Poupon because I have an appointment at Tar-jay.

					I was going to UFC for a while, but one time they served me some chicken that was has hard as leather.&nbsp; I complained and they acted like nothing happened.&nbsp; I stopped going there.&nbsp; That was over a year ago.&nbsp; It is a real shame because I love beer and am disappointed by the limited options in this neighborhood.&nbsp; Another thing that I did not like was that I felt vulnerable walking on Roosevelt late at night being cooked out of my mind.&nbsp; It has been a while, I will give it another shot - this time I will eat somewhere else first.&nbsp;

					The landlord didn&#039;t play his cards well to the extent that this award is essentially a penalty for destroying the wall in the midst of litigation.&nbsp; Had he waited, he could have torn it down without having to pay the artists.&nbsp; I think this is, on some level, wrong.&nbsp; In any case, the landlord should have been able to tear down the walls to invest in the neighborhood.&nbsp; NYC is the type of city where those in power think that they can keep taking and taking.&nbsp; NYC is the least business friendly place in America.&nbsp; It makes me question how long this an go on.&nbsp; At some point, people with money to invest will stop coming here because it is one government sponsored shakedown after another.&nbsp; Sometimes it feels like 50% of the population are constantly looking for handouts and the other 50% are obligated to work really hard to pay for them.&nbsp;

					I go to Ricky&#039;s pretty often for breakfast.&nbsp; My wife doesn&#039;t like the scrambled eggs - her complaint is that they are not fluffy, probably because they do not whip/whisk the eggs much.&nbsp; She also believes that the home fries have too much pepper.&nbsp; On that other hand, I like the eggs and I only had one experience with the home fries having too much pepper.&nbsp; The pancakes and french toast is pretty good too.&nbsp; We keep going back because the staff are truly special.&nbsp; They are so incredibly nice.&nbsp; They will remember you and treat you like family.&nbsp; At this point, I almost feel like I am cheating going anywhere else.&nbsp; Hence, the food has mixed reviews in my family but we all agree that we still like going there because of the staff and experience.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17403.msg83155#msg83155">Quote from: BEB on December 29, 2017, 03:43:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On a related side note: Can someone fill me in on what is good at Ricky&#039;s?
