				Hello! My husband and I are considering an apartment in the Madison Building at 35-06 88th Street. Anyone have any thoughts/input? We are a little worried that everything is a bit &quot;over priced&quot; right now. I read both of the recent threads on JH sales; but still wondering if anyone has more thoughts on a 2 bdrm(2nd bedroom is SMALL) prewar apartment...mostly in terms of pricing!!!<br /><br />Thanks and we hope to be moving into the area soon!<br /><br />Nicole

				It seems like sale prices really change from building to building.&nbsp; If you know you want to be in the Madison, then you could check comps in that building.&nbsp; You can look up that building for free on www.propertyshark.com . I just took a quick peek and saw that there were 4 sales in the past year at 300K, 340K, 370K and 455K.&nbsp; It&#039;s impossible to know the condition of the units just from propertyshark, but you may be able to determine how many bedrooms/bathrooms if you know which unit number corresponds to which kind of layout.<br /><br />Have you checked this thread:<br />Need help evaluating price of Real Estate (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=827.0)

				Thank you! I did see the other tread, and we have checked property shark! Just a little bit of cold feet and wanting to make sure we don&#039;t &quot;over-pay&quot; for the place!<br /><br />

				A friend of mine sold an apartment in that building 2-3 years ago.&nbsp; The apartment was big and she liked it.&nbsp; However her bedroom faced the street and she said there was a lot of noise coming from the residents across the street and it was very noisy on weekends.&nbsp; If your bedroom faces the front you might want to drive by between 10-12 on&nbsp; a weekend night.
