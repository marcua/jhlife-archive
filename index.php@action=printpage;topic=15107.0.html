				&nbsp;Police are using the 34th Ave bike lanes to ensnare riders. Twice in 3 days I have witnessed unreasonable tickets supposedly<br />for running red lights- other eyewitnesses agree- and it feels predatory. First time, the officers drove like a bat out of hell with<br />sirens on and we think they are going to an emergency. Then a young hispanic biker goes to put his foot down to stop and they<br />cut him off and say he ran a light the street before. Not true! We saw it. So a $50. ticket for him. Then another officer today<br />in an unmarked car stops another biker saying the same thing at the same place! Did the word go out that you can trap bikers<br />in this area? <br /><br />&nbsp;This is exactly the kind of thing we don&#039;t need in a summer of violence. Please stop ticketing bike riders for non-offenses! I<br />am all for enforcement of traffic laws but when we have a free-for-all on 37th ave of 3 pt turns and double parking and endless<br />honking on 73rd and 37th, this seems like really MISPLACED POLICING.<br /><br />&nbsp;To the 115th- STOP TICKETING THE BIKERS FOR RED LIGHTS WHEN YOU ARE IGNORING VEHICULAR VIOLATIONS THAT ARE<br />&nbsp;A COMMUNITY THREAT. WE DON&#039;T NEED THIS!

				So funny/not funny to read this... my husband and I just saw the same thing this morning, and he said how strange it was that undercover cars had been waiting around that area (34th Ave. and 74th St.) to ticket bicyclists.<br />It&#039;s so frustrating because it&#039;s not cyclists that have me afraid for my kids&#039; safety--it&#039;s irresponsible drivers. And in 8 years in Jackson Heights I have NEVER seen anyone pulled over for speeding or illegal U-turns.<br />By the way, our car got sideswiped last week by a patrol car-- the cop got to write his own report and said he had the siren on at the time, but my husband hadn&#039;t heard anything. The cop&#039;s word wins, of course, and so now it looks like the accident was my husband&#039;s fault. One of these days, an officer driving like a bat out of hell to ticket a cyclist is going to really hurt someone.

				Please reach out to Dromm&#039;s office and the internal affairs bureau. I&#039;ve seen some bike riders go through red lights and have almost been hit a few times but if multiple witnesses are saying the police are in the wrong, you need to speak up!!! I am not anti police but have no faith or trust in our local precint!

				Please not the the ticket for a bike is $130, vs. $50 for a car. I spoke with a guy this morning who received&nbsp; one from an unmarked car. I&#039;ve tweeted via @makequeenssafer and hope to meet with Dromm, or other council members to change this.

That&#039;s really outrageous in a community with so many flagrant<br />problems with cars and speed limits, crazy turns, endless honking, etc. The precinct was little help saying this could be<br />brought up at a community meeting to which I mentioned the website says there are none in July/August. Oh yeah. <br />Then call the community policing number he gave which turned out to be out of service. No help really.<br /><br />&nbsp;If I hadn&#039;t seen both of these police encounters with bikers with my own eyes, I would not believe how wrong they feel<br />to witness. But this is wrong with a capital W and we need to put a stop to it.

				&nbsp;Wow. It goes without saying that we should all follow traffic laws - bikers, pedestrians and all other vehicles. My point here is <br />the excessive, and in these 2 cases, unwarranted ticketing to bike riders. How many cars have you seen ticketed lately on 34th <br />Ave for speeding? If that was done, I would say &quot;fair play&quot; but it is not done! No one is ticketing vehicles here, just bikers.<br />&nbsp;A neighbor says he has seen many of these tickets written and always to Hispanic males who look to be going to work. The school <br />drop off areas on 34th Ave have outrageous violations and we can&#039;t scare up a policeman in those hours. It&#039;s a miracle there has <br />not been a horrific tragedy as you see parents unloading kids as they make u-turns mid street in heavy traffic with zero threat of a ticket <br />on the same street! Why?<br /><br />The injustice here is appalling. When we all get tickets for traffic violations, it&#039;s how the system should work but when one group<br />is singled out and harassed, I believe we need to correct course.<br /><br /><br />

I hate reckless cyclists too, but the only pedestrian/cyclist near misses I&#039;ve seen have all been the pedestrian&#039;s fault (including when I was the pedestrian).

				It is a huge ticket - maybe $130 in Queens but I got a ticket in Manhattan in a similar sweep 2 years ago, where literally every cyclist I know got a red light ticket. It was $190 and I went to court hoping to get that enormous fine reduced. The judge told me he hated cyclists and ignored everything I said but at least lowered the fine - to $150. Triple the fine for a car running a red light!!&nbsp; (Because bikes kill triple the amount of people as cars?)&nbsp; And -- if a cyclist gets a 2nd red light ticket it is like $350. !!! This doesn&#039;t even apply for cars. <br /><br />If cops want to ticket cyclists they need to start with the ones that really break laws and are reckless. Like riding electric bikes on sidewalks, going the wrong way down a one way, and talking on the phone or texting while cycling. These red light tickets for people being safe are cash grabs for cops who need to make quotas. <br />

				They&#039;ve been doing this all over the city. Watched them do this a few saturday night&#039;s ago right off the Williamsburg bridge, and have seen them ticketing bikers on 37th ave as well. They also have a stakeout at the intersection of Broadway / 37th Ave for the idiots who make the left at the no-turn sign when coming up Broadway from Woodside, but I agree with that one even though I hate when they do their quota stings.<br /><br />They need to crack down on those electric bikes that the delivery dudes ride though. I see a lot of them totally disregarding any traffic rules because they are &quot;bicycles&quot; but moving at a good enough clip to totally fuck someone up if they run into them.

				About five years ago I saw a bicyclist stop at a red light in NYC and wait for it to turn green before going again. At that moment I couldn&#039;t remember ever seeing that before. So I started keeping count. I&#039;ve since seen a bicyclist stop and wait out a red light another five times. For the sake of comparison, that&#039;s fewer than the number of bicyclists who have ripped off my headphones with their handlebars while blowing through a red light and a crosswalk full of people.

				How many New Yorkers cross against the red light? <br />Especially if the traffic has cleared? <br />Most of us, let&#039;s be honest.<br /><br />This topic was not posted about the outlaws who flaunt the traffic rules -bikers, pedestrians or vehicles- but those who are unfairly <br />ticketed or ambushed as I witnessed right here in Jackson Heights. Traffic violations here are flagrant by vehicles. And pedestrians.<br />Let&#039;s start the barrage of tickets there first if we have to have one...do I hear outrage? Or should we just pick on the bikers and<br />pretend this is our first priority with local traffic? If bikers run lights, tickets please. But do the same for vehicles, pedestrians too.

				So this evening I see this guy get snagged with a ticket for passing a red light on his bike.&nbsp; Now as I&#039;m&nbsp; waiting for them to finish writing out the ticket (I&#039;m in my car behind them waiting for the light and couldn&#039;t quite pass), there is a Honda making an illegal U turn across two double lines (This happens to be a pet peeve of mine , especially when I&#039;m driving). So I&nbsp; point it out to the cops who&nbsp; just ignore me. UGGHHH. I just don&#039;t understand how the vehicular&nbsp; traffic is allow to run amuck with so many blatant illegal maneuvers ( double parking , illegal U turns, parking at hydrants, radios so loud they trigger car alarms to go off...to name a few) and yet the focus is on cyclists exercising or commuting to or from work.

				I&#039;m sorry if police are drawing the conclusion that cyclists are the cause of accidents, and targeting cyclists via fines at red lights and stop signs. A bit like stop and frisk a particular race, just that it&#039;s stop and fine a particular kind of vehicle. If statistics are being used which reveal a rapid increase in cyclist fatalities and other involvement in accidents, I hope the analysis is controlling for (per eyeball observation over the past several years) a very rapid increase in cyclists using NYC roads. No doubt number of automobiles on NYC roads has been pretty constant and stable over the past few years, especially compared to growth in cyclists.<br /><br />Thanks to the CitiBike share program, ex-Mayor Bloomberg&#039;s good decision to paint more bike lanes (and isn&#039;t de Blasio generally continuing this trend?), and initiatives of organisations such as Transport Alternative to promote cyclists&#039; interests.<br /><br />For info, I got slapped with a fine by a police officer at 34th Av and 59th St (really nasty spot around 34 Av, 58 St, 59 St, 60 St and Broadway). Officer was sitting in his police car on 59th St. I failed to completely draw to a halt at a stop sign. The officer informed me a cyclist had been killed at that intersection (which has since had a bike lane about 10 feet long painted especially for cyclists turning left from 34 Av onto 59 St) the weekend beforehand.

				About a month ago, my 88 year old mother was run down by a bicyclist at the corner of Northern and 73rd.&nbsp; The cyclist ran a red light and kept going leaving my mother laying on the ground.&nbsp; She was &quot;lucky&quot; that she only suffered three broken ribs (and she and my father are getting along a lot better when she takes her new pain killers).&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to hear anymore from cyclists who believe the law shouldn&#039;t apply to them.&nbsp; If you run a red light and get a ticket, that&#039;s fine with me.&nbsp; If you want a piece of the road, then obey the rules of the road.&nbsp; And before anyone responds, I think the police should also double the enforcement of the traffic laws for all the reckless car drivers out there.&nbsp;

				I am sorry to hear of what happened and that your mother is in pain as a result. The biker that hit your mother is a selfish creep that lacks common decency. <br /><br />I don&#039;t recall anyone on this forum writing that they believe bikes should be allowed to run red lights. I only recall reading--and writing--that bikes should not be ticketed if they slow down and proceed with caution, like cars that are permitted to turn right on red at some intersections. <br /><br />and of course we all agree that &quot;...the police should also double the enforcement of the traffic laws for all the reckless car drivers out there.&quot;

				^yes, unless there&#039;s a sign telling you you can do it, it seems to be illegal. Just like in other municipalities where turning right on red is allowed, signage has to be put up to tell drivers no right turns on red.<br /><br />When I first moved to NYC I assumed no right on red was a state wide law. Thanks goodness I didn&#039;t drive much upstate until after I had been disabused of that notion.

				There is a unique light setup at 90th and Roosevelt. All traffic must turn right from 90th onto Roosevelt. It&#039;s a constant red arrow that turns to flashing yellow--and stays that way for about four, maybe five cars to pass through--then turns yellow for a second or two like a traditional light. There is no green. You are supposed to stop and proceed right with caution during the flashing yellow. <br /><br />There is no signage explaining anything. You&#039;ll be waiting forever if you wait for a green light. Basically, it&#039;s the same as turning right on red, but more clear to pedestrians that it is not their turn to cross. <br /><br />It used to be a stop sign, but this gives drivers a chance to go when there are so many pedestrians.

				Thank you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve written this before and I was scolded for it, but I think that most of the more egregious&nbsp; behaviors we see in traffic are committed by those among us who know they will not be ticketed, i.e. civil servants (cops, firemen-EMS?) and their family members. Just the other day I saw a double-parker asleep in his car. Spots opened up at the curb, but he remained lounging in the moving traffic lane. It is unlikely the average Joe would risk getting caught doing that, so seemingly confident was he of impunity. <br /><br />I think that is why we will never see the end of double parking and other common traffic transgressions.

				Jeanette, double parked cars on 37th avenue is a chronic problem along with illegal U-turns.&nbsp; The police don&#039;t pick and choose who to ticket.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very little, if any enforcement. Never a cop in sight, and when you do see one, they never enforce the law making it dangerous for both pedestrians and cyclist.

				Bull. I get stopped and ticketed! constantly for the slightest thing: moving slowly through a yellow light, wearing my seatbelt tucked under my shoulder rather than across my shoulder (because it was rubbing open a bug bite), holding my cell phone (even tho I wasn&#039;t talking on it), my passenger not having his seatbelt on, hesitating too long while deciding if I would be able to fit in a spot. I swear, I wouldn&#039;t DARE double park, speed or U-turn. I&#039;m afraid I would end up in jail, or worse. The cops are out there, in cars at least, and know who to pick on.

				It&#039;s great to hear that cops were patrolling on bike. It&#039;s so much easier to travel the neighborhood and become more aware of all the law breaking traffic around here. Even running the reds, (as I do with the Idaho Stop) will give them perspective on why it should become legal here. <br /><br />If you want to see someone hysterical and raging, I&#039;ve lately been live tweeting traffic infractions on Make Queens Safer on Twitter. It&#039;s a bit embarrassing for me, but something&#039;s got to give in the form of reckless driving reform and lack of ticketing. <br />Most days I try to be rational, but it&#039;s impossible since I know that in 2015 NYPD traffic got $13 million for Vision Zero enforcement, via 150 new traffic agents. (who do not write tickets for moving violations). Other parts of the funding went to speed guns. <br />
