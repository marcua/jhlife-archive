					I don&#039;t walk by this garage too often but someone who I know is looking to buy an apartment close to 82nd and 35th and&nbsp; wanted to know the daily and monthly parking costs for an SUV in this garage.&nbsp; I believe SUV&#039;s were slightly higher and the sales tax was a little more than 10%.&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated since I&#039;m not in the city this week and I told my friend I would try to find out for him this week.&nbsp; Thanks.

					I saw that Justmade4u is for sale after only 1 1/2 years.&nbsp; I have to be honest I never ate there.&nbsp; The price is $240,000 and they supposedly have a &quot;reasonable&quot; 8 1/2 years left on their lease.&nbsp; &nbsp;The owners are evidently relocating.&nbsp; The price seems very high to me unless the lease deal is fantastic.&nbsp; You could probably open a similar store in a vacant storefront&nbsp; with just the equipment costs and no purchase price. I would never open a business unless I knew I could last for few years.&nbsp; The start-up costs&nbsp; and personal investment are too much. Although sometimes re-locations are not planned but a necessity if a family member is sick or a spouse has a job opportunity or transfer.

					The Daily News has an excellent article about a coop complex in Bayside that has price floors on sales.&nbsp; Essentially the coop won&#039;t allow units to be sold below certain prices.&nbsp; The coop thinks this helps the coops keep value.&nbsp; My co-worker lives in this complex and the rule is preventing the sale of his coop.&nbsp; His wife recently had twins and he needs a bigger space but realtors have told him that his unit will never sell for anything near the price floor so he is stuck there. I would sue the coop board if this was my apartment. The article mentions a liberal subletting policy but that policy charges the shareholder $2,400 a year to sublet.<br /><br />I would never buy in a coop like this or one with a flip tax.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any buildings in JH that have a price floor?<br /><br /><a href="http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/stories/price-floors-leave-many-new-yorkers-stuck-apartments" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://bestplaces.nydailynews.com/stories/price-floors-leave-many-new-yorkers-stuck-apartments</a>

					Went tonight for dinner and they have a pretty typical diner menu.&nbsp; We had&nbsp; french onion soup, chicken quesadilla and a chicken souvlaki platter.&nbsp; The food was all pretty good.&nbsp; Service was pretty slow and we waited about a half hour for the food.&nbsp; The waitress did apologize twice for the slow service explaining it was their first day.&nbsp; A very nice renovation was done inside.&nbsp; It was more crowded at dinner than the Mark Twain used to be but it was only about 40% full.&nbsp; Very encouraging for the first day and will return in couple of weeks when they have some time to iron out the kinks.

					This guy never goes away!<br /><br />From the Daily News:<br /><br />Hiram Monserrate is so deep in debt he wants to stiff his autistic son and ex-wife on child support, the Daily News has learned.<br /><br />The disgraced ex-pol - who can&#039;t even cover his legal bills - has asked Manhattan Family Court to &quot;modify&quot; his monthly payments to his 14-year-old kid, his former wife said.<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s trying to use his son&#039;s child support to write off his other debts,&quot; Janet Monserrate, 40, said Wednesday. &quot;He has no attachment to anyone; he only cares about his ego.&quot;<br /><br />Monserrate, 43, pleaded poverty last month to Family Court Magistrate Karen Kolomechuk, stating that his sole income has been a $26,000 police pension since he was kicked out of the state Senate after his misdemeanor conviction for assaulting his girlfriend, Karla Giraldo.<br /><br />He also claimed a bad back has kept him from finding work.<br /><br />Kolomechuk initially denied the ex-cop&#039;s request. But then she agreed to consider it at a hearing this month, asking Monserrate to bring tax forms, medical proof of his injury and other paperwork in support of lowered payments.<br /><br />Currently, Monserrate pays $1,100 a month in child support.<br /><br />His ex-wife said if his payment modification request is granted, the new child support based on his pension would drop to about $400 a month.<br /><br />&quot;He&#039;s not looking for employment,&quot; Janet Monserrate said.<br /><br />&quot;This is a man who cares mainly about what people think. He won&#039;t work in a Home Depot, he won&#039;t work at a supermarket, he won&#039;t work two, three jobs to pay child support.&quot;
