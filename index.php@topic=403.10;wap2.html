			How about De Mole in Sunnyside?<br /><br />This thread on Chowhound includes a comment from someone who says that the huevos rancheros at De Mole&nbsp; are the best he&#039;s ever had. http://www.chowhound.com/topics/484075

			Oh, no, no worries. I didn&#039;t take it personally at all. I think a good part of the fun of chatting about restaurants is tossing back and forth about when they&#039;re good, when they&#039;re bad, and so on. I just wish you had hit it during one of their dynamo moments -- it&#039;s too bad the culinary stars didn&#039;t align with your visit.
