				Siren&#039;s Tale Productions presents a sneak preview screening of IN MONTAUK a romantic drama about a pregnant photographer on the cusp of success whoâ€™s affair with a composer leads her to make a life-changing decision.&nbsp; The film will be screening on Friday, December 2 at 7:00 pm at The Secret Theatre at 44-02 23rd Street in Long Island City.&nbsp; The screening will be followed by a Q&amp;A with Queens-based director Kim Cummings and lead actor Lukas Hassel.&nbsp; Suggested donation of $5.<br /><br />&nbsp;The film was shot in 10 days in Montauk and Queens in December, 2009 and January, 2010.&nbsp; Scenes were shot in recognizable Queens locations such as Long Island Cityâ€™s Secret Theatre and the Long Island City Arts Building, the 7-train platform at 33rd Street, Elmhurst Hospital and <strong>The Towers Co-op in historic Jackson Heights.</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />Cummings is the director of the award-winning short film WEEKI WACHEE GIRLS which played in over 70 festivals around the world and won 3 best-of awards. Other shorts include FLOWER OF A GIRL and THATâ€™S WHAT SHE TOLD ME, produced by Kate Greer &amp; Nick of Time Productions.&nbsp; IN MONTAUK is her first feature film.&nbsp; <br /><br />IN MONTAUK stars Nina Kaczrowski, Lukas Hassel and George Katt.&nbsp; Nina Kaczrowski has successfully combined her classic&nbsp; European looks with her spit-fire personality to land roles in blockbusters such as AUSTIN POWERS: GOLDMEMBER, MINORITY REPORT and A SIMPLE PLAN. Lukas Hassel was one of ten actors on the reality show SOAPSTAR, on SoapNet/ABC and recently played a lead role in Denmarkâ€™s top rated show ANNA PIHL. At present time, his image can be seen all over Norway in print and commercials as the suave and debonair â€œMr. Milkâ€ in Norwayâ€™s ad campaign for milk.&nbsp; He is the winner of the â€œBest Breakthrough Actor Awardâ€ at the NY International Independent Film Festival for his starring role in the independent feature film VALLEY OF ANGELS opposite Danny Trejo.<br /><br />This film is made possible (in part) by the Queens Council on the Arts with public funding from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. The film is supported in part by a grant from the Long Island Film Foundation.<br />(http://)<br />
