By way of even more literal explanation, the main characters on the awning headline that they serve &quot;pleasant happy cow meat noodle,&quot; and the chef/owner acquired the nickname &quot;Stony&quot; somewhere along the course of his career, so &quot;Happy Stony Noodle&quot; it is and, with or without any added spice, some excellent Taiwanese food (beef noodle soup also being a classic dish from Taiwan). It&#039;s most def worth the short jaunt to Elmhurst!

					That may well be true for Cornell alumni, though Wegman&#039;s fame obviously extends beyond Ithaca. You probably won&#039;t be surprised to know Upstate has its own (admittedly beautiful) Bermuda Triangle, covering the space between the points of Syracuse, Albany, and Binghamton. Anyone who has the means and desire will drive for miles outside that food desert to shop at Wegman&#039;s, just to find more nutritious options than roadkill.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" />

					Only to clarify a couple points raised in this thread:<br /><br />Please remember NY has a &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; law, so no one need fear the consequences of otherwise good intentions. The statute in full at: &lt;http://la12.org/Portals/733/Web_content/files/NYSGoodSamaritanLaw.pdf&gt;<br /><br />Along those lines, the very sad story of our fellow Queensian Catherine Genovese was actually more complicated. As it turned out, the supposed non-responsive &quot;bystander effect&quot; (the subsequently so-called &quot;Genovese syndrome&quot;) reported by the NYTimes was documented years later by that very paper of record as having been &quot;grossly exaggerated.&quot; In point of fact, at least one neighbor heard Kitty&#039;s screams and came to her aid. See: &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/nyregion/winston-moseley-81-killer-of-kitty-genovese-dies-in-prison.html&gt;<br /><br />Having noted that historical discrepancy, it was once said you get more of a response yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; than &quot;Help!&quot; So there&#039;s that...

					Here to whinge that almost eight years later, the quality of our neighborhood USPS in delivering (Amazon) packages has -- surprise! -- not improved. Only yesterday I got the same song and dance as reported upthread (&quot;delivery attempted,&quot; &quot;receptacle blocked,&quot; though neither I nor the doorman saw/heard signs of any USPS struggle). What I didn&#039;t get, of course, was all of the supposedly guaranteed two-day shipment. <br /><br />With the holiday weekend ahead, I&#039;m actually sympathetic to not completely keeping to one&#039;s &quot;appointed rounds&quot; (two of the three shipped parcels did in fact make it, despite the &quot;blocked&quot; receptacle), but please refrain from using bogus reasons. Just say it came in too late to hustle it through to the carrier. ShEEEsh.<br /><br />As for future deliveries (and solutions!), has anyone made use of the Amazon drop box/&quot;locker&quot; in the 7/11 on Roosevelt (street-level in the same bldg as Blink, I think)? Thanks in advance for the feedback.

					Reluctant to respond, insofar as it keeps this thread alive when it would be better resting in peace at the bottom of this forum. In regard of both restaurants, however, it&#039;s odd that the OP singles out these two when, as the linked DoH website shows, there are plenty of others on 37th Ave that have received a B grade as well. Whassupwiddat, hoya718?!<br /><br />Moreover, Dodger&#039;s observation that our neighbors&#039; livelihoods are often on the line, thanks to such comments, could not ring truer. And anyone who knows the story of the team at SawShack would agree it would be a crying shame to have their reputation ruined, not to mention their contribution to our nabe (and excellent take-out!) eliminated, by an off-hand remark, much less an arbitrary DoH grade.

					Well, again, this much is certain: The plan for eliminating Rikers involves refurbing existing facilities in addition to reducing numbers of the unnecessarily detained. No one is talking about knocking FDR from his new memorial perch on Roosevelt Island to build a new incarnation for incarceration there, for example. From our paper of record: &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-is-said-to-back-plan-to-close-jails-on-rikers-island.html?_r=0&gt; <br /><br />As for new flight paths and noise, only the oracle of the FAA could tell what an expansion of LGA onto Rikers might entail. At the same time, who would argue that remaining vigilant or being proactive hurts, unless they take some sort of pleasure in being &#039;obstreperous&#039;?<br /><br />

					Agreed with abcdefghijk, and not so fast with the not happening: Before Rikers, people were held at facilities in each borough which, according to the de-commissioning plan, are to be refitted/rehabbed/rebuilt to reabsorb the population Rikers now has (or, rather, should not have). Since those jails are already on city property closer to the court complexes in the justice system, there&#039;s not much NIMBY-noisemaking could do to prevent potential expansion. Most aren&#039;t even close enough to exclusively residential areas to warrant an outcry. For LaGuardia, on the other hand ...&nbsp;

					It could only be taken as offensive, if you are unaware of the origins of the term. Unfortunately, it does appear to be a big scary word on this thread. For the sake of preventing further confusion about what is meant by Orient/Oriental/Orientalist/Orientalism in this context, please see <em>Orientalism</em> by Edward Said (New York: Pantheon, 1978). Or, if you prefer the CliffNotes/Wikipedia version, see: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)&gt;. <br />Thanks again!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Thanks for your contrastingly learned response, NYCPeromyscus! Even so, may I ask you to (re)read the DNA posting, please, and then consider the wider-reaching implications of this doctoral study? Without question, there is the obvious boost to select restaurateurs (though likely not the other, less savoury entrepreneurs along Roozie). What additional effects might result, however, from hypotheses about the &quot;super-diversity&quot; up and down the Avenue, when those assertions are based solely in limited investigations of the wide variety of &quot;ethnic&quot; cuisines present? <br /><br />For my (clearly uninformed) part, I&#039;m skeptical about &quot;ethnicities&quot;--much less, &quot;race&quot;--being the only way &quot;diversity&quot; works. Historically, that is, such explorations invite the kind of class and cultural interactions that have led at best to gentrification and at worst to genocide. Sure, Marco Polo&#039;s account of the riches of Cathay inspired Christopher Columbus, but did the locals in the &quot;New World&quot; really need his &quot;discovery&quot;?&nbsp; Or are we to concern ourselves simply with consumption?

					My thanks to Lalochezia and others for answering my initial response. I’m afraid the beautifully written “sophistry&quot; has also led to some unfortunate, unwarranted conclusions. <br /><br />That is especially to say that I never stated I did not want sidewalk cafés. Again, they’re a lovely idea in any practicable space, particularly for those entertaining Continental aspirations. Even so, JH is known to have one of the highest population densities in NYC, at least according to &lt;https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=80f9b95a4ce0491091f1477710f6a91d&gt; (as of 2015). Moreover, those areas with similar density (e.g., E.Vill. or the UES) have sidewalks along their avenues that are, generally speaking, actually wider (according to the NYC.gov map Lalochezia cited).<br /><br />Though I post here on JHLife very infrequently, I do read the threads with regularity. As a result, I recognize Lalochezia among others on this forum as those who have often fought the good fight against entrenched NIMBY positions in this community. Yet not everyone here who disagrees with any one particular issue—certainly not I—always already supports those old-school attitudes, too. What I support above all is a measured, reasonable perspective that acknowledges, in this instance for example, the physical impact of density and infrastructure in this neighborhood, both of which make the import of any desired café culture into JH challenging to say the least. <br /><br />That difficulty arises, I additionally argue, from the historical fact that—all pearl-clutching aside—the WASP who designed and developed this neighborhood, or the residents he once attracted, would not likely have ever conceived of such culture working here or fitting into his Scotch-plaid fabric. Jane Jacobs made her argument based on what was then still considered to be a working-class Greenwich (now West) Village, but not on the plans of a white-flight pandering, bougie developer like MacDougall. <br /><br />As one can clearly see, then, these concrete features of JH I reference are not without merit when looking at, say, the installation of tables on sidewalks—certainly not any less merit than a similar uproar caused by the newest newstand. Furthermore, I should think the historical context also has merit, since it is primarily the Historic District we are arguing about, is it not?<br /><br />In short, having now dispatched with the points raised, I am unsure whether Lalochezia et al. fully understand the advantageous use of what s/he calls “sophistry,” when it is instead the simple employment of, I hope, civil rhetoric. With the ad hominem assumptions made, however, Lalochezia has doubtless fulfilled the denotative criteria for his/her username. Kudos for consistency! And thanks again for your consideration!
