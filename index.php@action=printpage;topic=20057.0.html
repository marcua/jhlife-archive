				The C building has had more sponsor sales than any other building, so it makes sense to have more resales there too, but it is still a bit weird to see all the resales at once.

				NewYorkNas:&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t own at Washington Plaza but according to previous sales over 125 of the 198 units have sold since the sales office opened in April 2016 which far exceeds 50%.&nbsp; It would appear that the sponsor currently owns 30% of the units.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are currently 7 resales which is not unusually high considering the number of units that were sold since April 2016.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since you&#039;re interested in Washington Plaza, hopefully some owners will respond.&nbsp;

				I think the sponsor still owns the majority of apartments and the majority of shares (which is the important part), so the sponsor controls the board. <br /><br />But that should change soon, either when a few more sponsor apartments are sold, or when 5 years have passed since the co-op conversion started.<br /><br />For anyone overwhelmed by that other huge thread, a lot of things have improved over the last few years. There are new gates, lobbies, laundry rooms, basement repainting, fios, wifi, bike room, buildinglink, and almost a gym. I probably forgot something. But I was surprised to see the listings in C.

				If the sponsor has sold over 125 apartments and currently owns the remaining units that are tenant occupied that possibly represents about 30% of the units how is it possible that the sponsor controls the majority of the apartments?&nbsp; Your response makes no sense and is irresponsible.&nbsp;

				Again, ownership is based on shares (which are different for each apartment). Focusing on the number of apartments is the wrong thing.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think the sponsor has sold 125 apartments. Do you have a source for that?

				The best resource to find resale is by using acris.<br /><br />According to acris,&nbsp; the sponsor sold 87 units between Oct 2016 and Jan 2020. We don&#039;t know how many of them are in contract after Jan 2020<br /><br />If there are 198 units in total, the sponsor still controls 111 units.&nbsp; Granted the number of units is not the same as the number of shares as the number of shares depend on the apartment size (and also other factors), but it gives you a rough idea. In any event, buyers tend to buy bigger apartments than renters. My guess is that the sponsor is still controlling less than 111/198 (maybe less than 50% due to the sponsor&#039;s tending to own small size apartments) share. The exact number has to be obtained from the management company. <br /><br />
