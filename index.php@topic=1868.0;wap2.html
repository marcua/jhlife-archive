			Jackson Heights Times<br />Armstrong biographer brings book to Corona<br />By Anna Gustafson<br />Thursday, January 14, 2010 7:12 PM EST<br /><br />When Louis Armstrong first saw his home in Corona in 1943, he told his cab driver to stop joking with him and bring him to the correct address â€” the house before him was just too grand.<br /><br />â€œOne look at that big fine house, and right away I said to the driver, â€˜Aw, man, quit kidding and take me to the address that Iâ€™m looking for,â€™â€ author Terry Teachout describes Armstrong as saying in his recently released biography of the jazz legend.<br /><br />Teachout sat in Armstrongâ€™s much loved Queens home where he lived out his days for a party Saturday in honor of Teachoutâ€™s 475-page tome, â€œPops: A Life of Louis Armstrong,â€ published in December by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.<br /><br />â€œThere are many books about Louis Armstrong, but oddly no one until now has written the definitive chronological Louis Armstrong biography,â€ said Michael Cogswell, director of the Louis Armstrong House Museum.<br /><br />Follow link for complete article
