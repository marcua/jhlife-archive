				Love pictures of old Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Thanks for posting them.&nbsp; For those that may be curious, the picture of the interior garden (picture id 464795) is Linden Court.&nbsp; You can tell it is Linden Court because you can just make out the garages.&nbsp; Easier to see by expanding the picture.&nbsp; Picture id 464796 is also Linden Court.&nbsp; It is the middle of the block building on 84th street.&nbsp; If you look really carefully at the expanded view of this picture you can make out the original shutters that were on the corner sun rooms. Kinda cool to see.<br /><br />Great pics.&nbsp; Thanks again for posting them.<br /><br />

				These are great!&nbsp; Thanks!<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to place the pic of 80th St. at 37th Avenue (Image ID: 725658F).<br /><br />Can anybody figure out where it was taken from and which road is 80th and 37th?<br /><br />

				At the time when the photo in post 31 was made, the Citadel was playing a double bill:<br /><br />That Certain Age, with Deanna Durbin and Melvyn Douglas, featuring a song called My Own which was nominate for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Here&#039;s Tommy Dorsey&#039;s version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fREG3lYZDBo&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLEgdShMdePfqSsPY_QKpAI5mHJCNpCQVk<br /><br />King of Alcatraz, with a 20 year old Robert Preston and 23 year old Anthony Quinn. Billy Wilder is said to have done some script doctoring on the film.<br /><br />Does anyone know when the Citadel closed?

				Interesting, I&#039;ve never seen this called the Citadel Theater before.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a number of references to a Colony Theater (http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/4025/photos) in what looks like the same location.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never been able to find pictures of the interior of this theater, unfortunately.<br /><br />But over the years, some people have shared memories of the various theaters of Jackson Heights (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=7263), and we&#039;ve paused to remember the Polk (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=357.msg2587#msg2587), the Jackson (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1268.0), and the Earle/Eagle (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4225.msg28001#msg28001).&nbsp; We should really pull together photos of the Boulevard, Fair, and Colony/Citadel theaters if we can find them.

Comments in your link suggest that it ceased to be a theater around about 1990.<br /><br />People can see a larger version of the photo here: http://www.oldnyc.org/#1558452 (http://www.oldnyc.org/#1558452). Clicking on the photo leads to another page which has a tool to enlarge the photo. On the oldnyc.org (http://oldnyc.org) map this photo is erroneously placed at the corner of Roosevelt and 82nd St, probably because there&#039;s a description on the photo itself that is misleading.<br /><br />There&#039;s a 2009 piece from The Atlantic called The Kosher Chocolate Wars about Barricini Candy, which owned the store on the far right of the photo: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/04/the-kosher-chocolate-wars/13045/ (http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/04/the-kosher-chocolate-wars/13045/)

				From the same source, here&#039;s a photo of the Jackson Theater: http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47dd-6914-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 (http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47dd-6914-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99).<br /><br />The film Geraldine was released in 1929, so the photo must have been taken then rather than in 1928.<br /><br />Based on a story by Booth Tarkington, Geraldine was a romantic farce staring Marian Nixon, Eddie Quillan and Albert Gran.

				the Fair was (is?) a strange case. some time ago, late 1990s, perhaps 2000, it got some note in underground film press for an intent to run rare horror flicks, mostly spanish. my ex a and i were fans of the genre and decided to check it out. found it was actually running porn on two screens and the &quot;horror&quot; on a third, but that auditorium was actually mainly being used for the same thing as the other two, so we exited quickly....and got a refund from a very amused cashier.

The attached ad in the United States Tobacco Journal for Saturday, November 26, 1921 appears to be for the company.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a reference to Natural Bloom Cigars at the beginning of the third stanza of Weldon Kees&#039;s poem <em>Relating to Robinson</em>:<br /><br />Somewhere in Chelsea, early summer;<br />And, walking in the twilight toward the docks,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I thought I made out Robinson ahead of me.<br /><br />From an uncurtained second-story room, a radio&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Was playing There’s a Small Hotel; a kite<br />Twisted above dark rooftops and slow drifting birds.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />We were alone there, he and I,<br />Inhabiting the empty street.<br /><br />Under a sign for Natural Bloom Cigars,<br />While lights clicked softly in the dusk from red to green,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />He stopped and gazed into a window<br />Where a plaster Venus, modeling a truss,<br />Looked out at Eastbound traffic. (But Robinson,<br />I knew, was out of town: he summers at a place in Maine,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Sometimes on Fire Island, sometimes the Cape,<br />Leaves town in June and comes back after Labor Day.)<br />And yet, I almost called out, “Robinson!”<br /><br />There was no chance. Just as I passed,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Turning my head to search his face,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />His own head turned with mine<br />And fixed me with dilated, terrifying eyes&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />That stopped my blood. His voice<br />Came at me like an echo in the dark.<br /><br />“I thought I saw the whirlpool opening.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Kicked all night at a bolted door.<br />You must have followed me from Astor Place.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />An empty paper floats down at the last.<br />And then a day as huge as yesterday in pairs&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Unrolled its horror on my face<br />Until it blocked—” Running in sweat&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />To reach the docks, I turned back<br />For a second glance. I had no certainty,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />There in the dark, that it was Robinson&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Or someone else.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The block was bare. The Venus,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Bathed in blue fluorescent light,<br />Stared toward the river. As I hurried West,&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The lights across the bay were coming on.<br />The boats moved silently and the low whistles blew.<br /><br /><br />

				i believe the top of the apartment building (red) appearing in the picture is the apartment called &quot;THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES&quot; in the play of the same name written by the playwright John Guare who was a resident of the apartment as a young boy. The name referred to the wallpaper throughout the lobby of the building which he thought was odd.
