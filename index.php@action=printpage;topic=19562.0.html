				Amazon has placed a Hub in our building on 78th Street.&nbsp; I wonder how many other buildings are getting this convenience/privacy invasion?&nbsp; <br /><br />While this seems to solve the problem of porch pirates, at least for small items that fit into a locker, I wonder how much information we&#039;re surrendering to Jeff Bezos and Co.&nbsp; (BTW, i understand that Amazon and Google already know everything about me, but I signed up for Prime and Gmail.&nbsp; What about those that haven&#039;t?&nbsp; I presume Amazon has at least one of their cameras installed on the Hub.)<br /><br />I assume your co-op board or owner&#039;s association will discuss this with owners, but even if you opt out, that camera will still be there.

				i hadn&#039;t heard about hubs being placed in residential buildings -- which seems like a pretty bad idea to me. i would hope that a board/management company would discuss this with shareholders/tenants before implementing it -- our board (which had a very different makeup back then) asked for input about putting cellphone towers on our roof many years ago. although the cash flow would have been beneficial, most of us objected (particularly residents on the top floor, who&#039;d have faced the most potential negatives).<br /><br />and, out of curiosity, what is the deal with the cutesy names for the hubs? Geranium? Dizi?

				Yeah, I agree with dssjh -- that&#039;s the kind of thing that should be discussed with owners/residents. I certainly wouldn&#039;t want that in my building and I wouldn&#039;t make a decision on behalf of my tenant-owners.

Maybe not all buildings want the super to have to spend his time doing that, as it likely takes time away from other tasks.<br /><br />The other thing is that piles of packages make the lobby look messy, and it opens up the possibility that outsiders will try to access the lobby in order to steal. (I don&#039;t think that&#039;s happened in our building but it could.)

				granted, volume is MUCH higher with Amazon in the mix, but we&#039;ve had package delivery for decades. UPS and USPS have managed to place packages in designated areas (by mailboxes, for instance) forever. i know Amazon treats its workers like crap and places premiums on piece work, but there has to be some way to rein in the chaos.

This fits in with that scheme. What do they get out of it? Maybe it&#039;s just lower shrinkage expenses, but who knows? In the meantime, smile when you pass by, you&#039;re on Candid Camera.

				&nbsp;We had a package go missing over Thanksgiving weekend and it was a beloved Patagonia jacket, used for decades and sent out for a zipper repair. The thief probably thought it was a new item and wasn&#039;t happy to find this old worn coat in the package. If anyone sees a royal blue vintage jacket out there. with plenty of wear on it that someone just acquired, we would like to ask a couple of questions.<br /><br />&nbsp;For the record, the JH Post Office was very helpful and so is the Patagonia company.

				&nbsp;Theft of packages here in Jackson Heights buildings - maybe homes- is now epidemic. People should<br />consider taking photographs of all of the delivery people they see from the ground level. Especially<br />anyone who has their face mostly covered by sunglasses, hats, hoodies. And photograph the vehicles<br />with the license plate clearly visible. There have been LOTS of thefts here lately and they are in plain<br />sight of us. Time to strike back and create a base of information to catch them. If you can&#039;t take the<br />photo, note the time and description of everything. <br />&nbsp; <br />And yes, Amazon Prime, with their random delivery workers and vehicles, have changed this process of delivery and should take a share of the blame. Jeff Bezos, invest in your people and train them properly as you can afford to do this!!!

				This morning, I buzzed in someone who said he was from Amazon. I naturally assumed a package of mine had been delivered, but when I went out a few minutes later to get it, I noticed he was still in the lobby taking photos, which I thought was very strange and, frankly, creepy. <br /><br />When I said, &quot;Excuse me, can I help you?&quot; he asked if our building was interested in installing a Hub. I said no, since we&#039;re a small building and there is literally no room in the lobby. He still wouldn&#039;t leave even after I asked him several times and got belligerent, saying he was just doing his job and that I could call the cops if I was scared. It seems strange and creepy that Amazon would ask people to take uninvited photos on private property.
