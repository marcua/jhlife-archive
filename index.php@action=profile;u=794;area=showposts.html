So even though it&#039;s been said already, it seems to bear repeating. The IDC blames Felder and Felder blames the IDC for <strong>all of them allowing the Republicans to retain leadership</strong>. Let&#039;s call all their bluffs.<br /><br /><strong>The Senate leadership determines which bills get voted on.</strong><br /><br />IMO that is the issue people need to understand before deciding what to do with their&nbsp; Senator. There is no point in putting pressure on your Senator to vote a certain way on a particular bill, if the bill that you really want is never put up for a vote.

					It depends where you live. There are two clubs for each district (Parts A and B, I think, but don&#039;t quote me on the exact terminology). <br /><br />I have heard that the New Visions club is much more active, and that many people who &quot;should&quot; belong to the JFK club have joined NV because of that.<br />

I will also probably enjoy some things about the new neighborhood that develops.<br /><br />I have had MANY conversations with young adults who grew up here but are having to look elsewhere for housing, and with other neighbors (taxi-drivers, nannies, people who work in local stores and restaurants, just for a few examples) who had to move when their new lease upped the rent for a 1-bedroom from $1100-1200 to $1600-1700, and so on.<br /><br />It is pretty clear that the days of JH as a first stop for immigrants are ending. Which means the diversity, restaurants, etc. that everyone celebrates will <strong>eventually</strong> go as well.<br />

					Another side of the story re: fake SSNs according to the <strong>chief actuary of the SSA</strong><br /><br />&quot;Stephen Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, estimates that about 1.8 million immigrants were working with fake or stolen Social Security cards in 2010, and he expects that number to reach 3.4 million by 2040. He calculates that undocumented immigrants paid $13 billion into the retirement trust fund that year, and only got about $1 billion in benefits.&quot; <br /><br />He goes on to say that the SSA counts on those funds going unclaimed in order to pay out benefits to elderly retired workers.<br /><br />The link to one article (picked somewhat at random because it&#039;s relatively short):<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/undocumented-immigrants-and-taxes/499604/</a><br /><br /><br />

					JH3525 -- but you also support Trump and his good work, correct?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure Peralta wants vocal support from Trump supporters right now, <br /><br />since he is trying to make the case to his Democratic and/or progressive constituents that he is&nbsp; opposing Trump by joining with the Republicans in the Senate.<br />

					Tempers are clearly hot -- but I just read through thedude&#039;s posts, and other than posting in more than place (which he is now aware he shouldn&#039;t do) I don&#039;t really understand what the problem is.<br /><br />I too was pretty upset at being labeled an outside agitator in my own neighborhood, by a guy I have voted for several times! And I (along with many people I know personally) was part of getting people to the meeting -- it was very much a neighbor-to-neighbor grassroots effort, so his accusations that it was the Party doing something nefarious is equally galling.<br /><br />And IMO, the issue is not about an individual&#039;s voting record. The issue is about control of a chamber, where the majority party decides which legislation gets voted on.

					Yes, I&#039;ve heard that. But we have a better chance of getting rid of the IDC senators than Cuomo.

					Senator Peralta, many of your progressive constituents are not buying this argument.<br /><br />As others have already pointed out, caucusing with the Republicans is a completely different thing from the kind of coalition building or trading you are describing in this response.<br /><br />I am part of a lot conversations in the last few months about how to respond to the new era, and I can tell you that dealing with our local leadership is a huge part of those conversations.<br /><br />The IDC in particular has been a big topic of conversation, with discussions about trying our best to get rid of those senators. I was completely shocked and upset by the news this morning. I would have called your office, but was unable to do so during business hours. I&#039;ll be calling soon!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if we are going to succeed -- and clearly you are calculating that you are too entrenched to be challenged in a primary, but we are going to do our best.
