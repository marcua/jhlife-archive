				I&#039;m happy to see the neighborhood get a dog park, but I can&#039;t help but think a huge opportunity was missed in not building it at Travers. What percentage of the neighborhood will regularly take its dogs to 69th street, the western-most boundary of JH?<br /><br />Since the long walk to 69th street from the mid-80s prohibits me from taking my dog to the park except on weekends, I might as well drive over on Saturdays to the very large and well-kept Hillside park in Brooklyn.

				Ah, Travis-centricism!!!&nbsp; The mid 80&#039;s is a long way to walk for the many Jackson Heights residents who live near 69th Street.&nbsp; &nbsp; :angel:<br />But the real reason 69th Street was chosen is simply because that is where the State of New York had land to give; the site is on State owned land adjacent to the BQE and there is no similar parcel near Travis, and Travis itself has no space to use for a dog park.<br />While Hillside remains a weekend option for you, I hope you will visit the local dog park as well.<br /><br /><br />

				liam0925,<br /><br />First a quick correction: Travers is at 77th, so I have just as far a walk to it as does anybody coming from 69th street. <br /><br />I don&#039;t meant to belittle the effort. Land is scarce in the neighborhood and a dog run at 69th is much, much better than not having one at all. If I seem Travers-centric it&#039;s only because the park is more central and is currently going through a much-criticized renovation. If only that renovation included a small parcel of land for dogs!<br /><br />And of course I&#039;ll visit the local dog park. Just not as often as I&#039;d like :(

				There are a few fields on 79th and 30th avenue/24th ave. People always let their dogs run around there. I think the airport owns one side and the parks dept owns the other. If there were a fence all around it would be a perfect dog run/park
