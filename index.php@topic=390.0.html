								<div class="inner" id="msg_1837">IMHO, micro-managing anything can have disastrous results. The rules are there for anyone to read. Most topics will go off on many tangents and still be interesting reading. It should be the job of the mods to strike out anything inflammatory or personally insulting or offensive, and state in the post why something was deemed against the rules and therefore deleted. Avela stated an opinion. I pos nodded the post because it seemed to me that it took a lot of courage to say what was said as the OP posted 2 days prior and no-one else wanted to venture in on this discussion. We are mostly adults who really don&#039;t require a class monitor. ::Gee, I wonder if they still have them?:: </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3147">When we set out to establish Jackson Heights Life as a resource for building community within Jackson Heights, we knew from the beginning that two key issues -- protection of privacy and maximizing freedom of speech -- would pose the thorniest challenges.&nbsp; These two goals are often in conflict, and our role as moderators of the forum is to seek an appropriate balance between the two.&nbsp; This effort remains a work in progress.<br /><br />We have grown concerned about the discussion and speculation about private individuals in this forum.&nbsp; Such discussion -- even if done without malicious intent -- can be very damaging to them, especially if it is done without their knowledge and they don&#039;t have an opportunity to respond.<br /><br />After careful consideration, we have decided to establish a new rule prohibiting the discussion of the behavior or motivations of private individuals.&nbsp; We have removed two threads where these types of posts have been particularly common: &quot;Classic Characters&quot; and &quot;Skid Row.&quot;&nbsp; Although nothing that was posted there was intended to attack individuals personally, their effect could be seen as an invasion of privacy that might be isolating and intimidating for the individuals being described and discussed.<br /><br />This decision was a difficult one, and we welcome your feedback.&nbsp; We are aware that the new rule is vague and needs to be sharpened to work effectively over the long run.&nbsp; The community&#039;s guidance on how to do this would be appreciated.<br /><br /><div align="center">--Shelby2, Toddg and Merm</div></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3219">Had to think about this for awhile before replying.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re right to remove the threads.&nbsp; I remember making a comment in the Classic Characters about someone I met while walking my dog but don&#039;t really remember the Skid Row thread. (And may have commented there too, but just don&#039;t remember.)&nbsp; I think if I were to read something written about me in either thread, my feelings would be hurt.&nbsp; &nbsp; At the time, it seemed harmless and benign and I do think the comments were not meant to be anything but fun.&nbsp; So I can only go by how I&#039;d feel.&nbsp; I know some of the comments back and forth on other threads get passionate at times.&nbsp; Or if passionate is too strong a word, then I&#039;d say people write with much feeling.&nbsp; But they&#039;re comments where people are sharing their opinion on a &quot;subject&quot; and the subject isn&#039;t a person.&nbsp; &nbsp;But these threads didn&#039;t give a pro or con on a topic (again, I don&#039;t remember Skid Row&#039;s content).&nbsp; They just talked about people in a playful (but could actually end up being hurtful) manner.&nbsp; And, like I said, I commented there.&nbsp; Live and learn.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3265">Privacy and (free) speech are competing rights that will never be resolved by censorship. Doing so can only have pejorative consequences. Everyone should have the right of freedom of expression in this or any other forum. This right should include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by URL owners and their moderators. Over the past few decades, the struggle to define privacy has become more confused. Even the concept of privacy has become very difficult to define. Is it possible to judge whether what you write or say in a forum like this will cause emotional harm? How do you define what people cannot talk or write about? Should free expression be treated on a par with privacy in the first place?<br /><br />Freedom of speech is the lifeblood of democracy.<br /><br />Having free speech being censored in the name of privacy is absurd. <br /><br />I read both the removed threads. I found nothing either harmful or litigious in either of them. I also found nothing that could have been hurtful to the persons mentioned. All I saw were descriptions of sad, homeless people living in the neighborhood. It was a lively discussion by local residents who were simply relating information via their opinions to other local residents. As a consequence, I personally find that the removal of these 2 threads were decided in an arbitrary manner. <br /><br />If someone approached you and expressed their displeasure with these threads, then it would be incumbent on you to tell the posters on this forum what was said and that that was part of the reasoning behind this decision. <br /><br />I somewhat understood the reasoning behind merm&#039;s thought process questioning whether or not to shut down the political threads on your sister forum, Astorians. There were some very nasty personal insults that truly needed to be moderated, although the the threads&#039; posters seemed to be doing a rather good job of that themselves. <br /><br />I grant that the privacy issue is an important one. But, I see no such issue with either of those threads.<br /><br />No-one disclosed any secrets. No-one divulged anything that the community-at-large did not already know about. The people mentioned were also not harmed by the description of them and where they are usually found. No-one was provocative or disrespectful in either thread. If there were any inaccuracies they were quickly corrected by the posters themselves. It was a non-threatening, intelligent discussion among neighbors. As I recall, there was no defamation of any of the people discussed. There also were no derogatory comments about any one particular person. It also seems to me that people only expressed what they saw and that is information available to anyone in the neighborhood. It&#039;s not like someone used an illegal method to obtain that information!<br /><br />I am also distressed that these threads were removed before any discussion about their potential removal. It would have been interesting to see how the JHL members felt about it. In general, it would be interesting to see how either forum would feel about being micromanaged to the point of making the forum no longer a viable part of the community. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=575.msg3147#msg3147">Quote from: toddg on March 07, 2008, 10:36:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We have grown concerned about the discussion and speculation about private individuals in this forum.&nbsp; Such discussion -- even if done without malicious intent -- can be very damaging to them, especially if it is done without their knowledge and they don&#039;t have an opportunity to respond.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I, for one, would very much like to know exactly how these discussions could even be perceived as damaging, even if done without the individuals&#039; knowledge. Astorians has a homeless man who periodically finds a way to a computer and posts in the forum. He has said many times that he is encouraged by the discussions of Astoria&#039;s homeless. He tells us not to worry about certain persons that the community-at-large had preconceived notions about being dangerous. Many of Astoria&#039;s older residents know him personally and have frequent discussions about what we can do to help the homeless in our area. He always recommends keeping an open discussion so that the situation just doesn&#039;t disappear into a twilight zone. He knows that the majority of people really care, and by calling attention to those individuals, someone may seek them out and be able to provide some help.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=575.msg3147#msg3147">Quote from: toddg on March 07, 2008, 10:36:40 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">After careful consideration, we have decided to establish a new rule prohibiting the discussion of the behavior or motivations of private individuals.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>How absurd can you get. I guess that means that every elected official has the right to claim that they are also private individuals. So, let&#039;s stop calling those who do nothing in the interest of their constituents useless and try to get them replaced. If someone were to remark that XXX poster has a great sense of humor and is always trying to make people in the forum laughâ€”that too would fall under your new prohibition. How about if someone posted that the super at ##-## Street told them that he demanded 2 months rent for them to be approved for renting an apartment, how would that clash with your new rule?<br /><br />Not only is the new rule vague, IMHO it is both not necessary and disrespectful of the intelligence of the members of this forum.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3283">In every forum, listserv, other online community I&#039;ve been part of (in many different contexts), there&#039;s always a struggle over how much moderation is necessary - from a heavy hand that keeps the community seemingly polite and mission focused on the surface but with tensions broiling underneath to almost no moderation which often leads to an utter breakdown.&nbsp; Despite the reminders in the rules and guidelines that we aren&#039;t necessarily strangers to each other - though who really knows whose posting here, right? - we ARE all going to act differently online than we would in a community meeting.&nbsp; Just the facts of online life.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s ever one right answer on the moderation question even for any single online community.&nbsp; I will say that the one thing that seems to be constant is that there are the fewest disagreements over moderation when it&#039;s very clear what the guidelines are, who gets to put them into place, and who gets to police them.&nbsp; Fewer, but they never end.<br /><br /><strong>I&#039;m incredibly grateful to the three of you who are giving your time and money to make this work for the rest of us!</strong>&nbsp; And, I&#039;m grateful that you seem to be doing it in a thoughtful manner and looking for input in making decisions.<br /><br />I keep just using the vague word moderation because I&#039;m not sure that I agree with the terms you used to describe potential problems with these particular threads (free speech vs privacy).&nbsp; I did not contribute to those threads (though I continued to read them), because I did find them a bit strange.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t find them off-putting enough, though, to say so publicly on the threads, even in a non-judgmental - hey I was reading them!! - and polite way.&nbsp; Perhaps as the site matures, those who turn into old-timers (in internet time) will get more used to self-policing and help direct threads.<br /><br />In this case, it seems that rather than delete the threads, it might have been wiser for someone - possibly a moderator whether in his/her personal voice or as a forum leader - to step in and start a discussion about the wisdom of those threads.&nbsp; For the record - unless there are posts that were deleted or that I missed - I agree with NYCMacUser that the posts didn&#039;t seem to cross any lines into what could have been ugly subjects.&nbsp; I guess I did in some way find them a bit odd, though not quite distasteful, but the discussion of individuals&#039; public selves does not in itself seem to violate their privacy.&nbsp; Do I agree with your characterization that despite good intentions, the effect may have been intimidating and isolating?&nbsp; Yes, in fact.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t think that meant that they should be deleted.<br /><br />[And as we&#039;ve already seen, especially in our community, ANY topic very quickly can end up with all sorts of overtones about socio-economic class, country of origin, race, and ethnicity.&nbsp; These can be both productive and interesting parts of community building and divisive.&nbsp; I hope we are able to continue to engage these issues in good constructive ways.]<br /><br />I&#039;m sure this all is related to other questions that have already come up about complaints (and praise?) for those doing business in our neighborhood.&nbsp; You say that not every post is read/moderated.&nbsp; Frankly, I don&#039;t see how you&#039;ll be able to successfully balance that desire for a fairly open forum and keep discussion away from individuals&#039; behavior and/or motivation.&nbsp; When do you lay down the law amongst &quot;Store Y has great z for sale;&quot; &quot;there&#039;s one person working at Store Y who will go out of his/her way in x and y fashion for you;&quot; &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y because s/he won&#039;t do x or y;&quot; and &quot;avoid person Z at Store Y who won&#039;t do x or y for you because person Z is lazy and is also trying to put his/her boss out of business so his/her cousin can buy the store cheaply.&quot;&nbsp; Everything but the first sentence talks about someone&#039;s behavior and motivation.&nbsp; [ok - weird example on my part, but I&#039;m not going to spend the time to come up with another one.]&nbsp; I&#039;ve quite happily participated in heavily moderated forums, and am happy to do so here, but that takes a LOT of work by the moderators because self-policing does NOT cut it.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s bad precedent to have rules that are therefore constantly broken.<br /><br />I think the current rules and guidelines are quite good.&nbsp; Would you consider doing two things though?&nbsp; One - in addition to the link at the top of the page, maybe pin a link to them on every board since that tends to be more in our line of site as a reminder to check the rules than it would be as it is posted now.&nbsp; And, if the founders/moderators feel comfortable, would you add a second post to the rules laying out who started this site, who has moderation power, whether that rotates ever, how to complain about a post, even who is paying the server bill, etc.&nbsp; The rules go in and out of talking as if everyone registered wrote them and an &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp; I did write &quot;you&quot; a lot in the paragraph above.&nbsp; At least as long as the site is still young, it&#039;s clearly someone else&#039;s (or rather several someones) site that I&#039;m participating in, not my site.&nbsp; Which is cool with me - I didn&#039;t put this party together - and maybe it&#039;s your intention is to change that balance.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m really thankful for the dedication already to transparency; I&#039;d love to see that go further and continue.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3340">NYCMacUser, jsh, and buddy--<br /><br />Thank you all for your carefully considered thoughts.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to respond to them now, as I&#039;m hoping to learn from what others have to say on this issue as well.<br /><br />However, there are some additional questions I&#039;d like to put on the table.<br /><br />First, all three of the moderators are longtime users of online forums, so we&#039;re aware that we have deviated from the norms in how these are managed.&nbsp; I personally am a fan of Wired New York, and admire how they&#039;ve cultivated a successful community with very little moderator intervention.&nbsp; But JHLife serves a different niche and a different purpose.&nbsp; Its goal is to build community and bring people together in real space.&nbsp; I see it as serving a public interest function beyond simply the exchange of ideas.&nbsp; Are there certain rules or norms that need to be put in place in order to fulfill that objective?&nbsp; We simply don&#039;t know, and are looking for models of other sites that have wrestled with these issues.&nbsp; Any suggestions for where we should look would be welcome.<br /><br />Second, to me, the privacy issue is real.&nbsp; Not only is it an issue today, but it is also entirely possible that a forum like this, or at least its archives, could exist for decades.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think our society has begun to grapple with the implications of that.&nbsp; But if we want to be proactive to prevent future harm, what precautionary steps should we be taking now?&nbsp; Again, there are no easy answers, and if there are other boards that are looking at these questions, we&#039;d like to know about them.<br /><br />Please keep up the feedback and advice.&nbsp; We are listening and value your input.&nbsp; This is a work in progress.</div>

Perhaps it requires a statement of purpose. Or maybe a Mission Statement? Have you asked your members what they want/expect from JHL? Or, for that matter, do you really care? You have already stated that your goal was to build community by bringing people together in real space; but I see no agenda of doing that. Here, in virtual space, the communication of people&#039;s ideas supersedes the dissemination of public interest information. Most of that is available in so many other places on the world-wide netz. <br /><br />Instead of having a people-based, community-driven or a community-based, people-driven forum, you might reconsider the whole concept and turn it into an old-fashioned BBS where folks could find out neighborhood happenings and plan their schedules around those activities.<br /><br />Before you make any hard-fast decisions it behooves you to deliberate on how quickly political correctness changes. What seems appropriate today may be demeaned tomorrow.<br /><br />I am continually amazed at how many people do not engage in controversial threads. The tell is the number of replies vs the views. If the topic was not interesting to them, they would not be reading it. What do you think keeps those lurkers from posting? In the same vein of thought, I also find it interesting to see the equation in those posts that have no replies and very few reads. Does that mean that they are not interesting to the audience?<br /><br />Did you yet determine your demographic? It couldn&#039;t be more different than Astorians! Yet it is equally as different as Jackson Heights is from Astoria. If, you based your goal for this forum on what you&#039;ve seen at Astorians, then you do have to seriously alter the concept. <br /><br /><strong>TO THE LURKERS IN THIS THREAD:</strong><br />Please step up to the microphone and let your voices be heard. If this forum is going to represent you, even with the already stated goals, you need to let merm, Toddg and Shelby2 know what you want/expect from this site. If you want it to be an informational resource, tell them. If you want it to be a place to make local friendships through public meetings and events, then tell them that. If you simply want to be able to discuss the neighborhood or if you want to be able to hold discussions about anything, let them know that.<br /><br />Remember, just like in an election if you don&#039;t vote then you don&#039;t have any right to complain about who gets elected. If you don&#039;t speak up now, you will have no right to complain about the direction this forum pursues.<br /><br />As of this writing, there have been 6 replies to this thread, but 87 views. STOP JUST READING THIS AND SAY SOMETHING, please.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_3442">ok, my 2 cents: &nbsp;I read at least some of the threads and agree that a moderator stepping in would&#039;ve been better than removing them. &nbsp; Maybe the rules can include the idea that there can be a limit to the length of a thread (or number of comments) discussing a private individual without their knowledge, period, without even having to &quot;speculate about behavior and motivation&quot;, etc.? &nbsp;To me it seems more a question of courtesy than one of free speech. &nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think censorship is good, but since it is a community site I think kindness (not politically correct-ness) now and then is not a bad thing. &nbsp; Ultimately, though, I hope the site will be as open as possible even if it gets uncomfortable sometimes.</div>
