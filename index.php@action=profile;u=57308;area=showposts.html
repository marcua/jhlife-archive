Thank you so much!<br />Hello! Kim Joseph here! Little Wildbranch Bakery!<br />If anyone is looking for fresh sourdough bread, I&#039;m your bread woman! My bread keeps incredibly well for 7 days, as any true sourdough should!<br />Every week I bake 2 types of bread- plain multigrain and baker&#039;s choice (flavors according to whats in season and where my creativity takes me). I tend to lean more towards ancient grains and whole grains, so here is where you will find nourishing hearty whole grain crusty loaves, all baked after hours in the pizza oven at The Queensboro! <br />I am at the Queensboro on Thursday evenings from 5-8 pm for bread pick ups. Most of the bread is by order to avoid waste, but I do try to bake extras, which go quickly. <br />I take orders weekly until 5 pm on Tuesdays, because that is when I make the dough. <br />You can find my weekly bread and most up to date info on Instagram and Fb, and of course my website at <a href="https://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com/</a><br />You may also text me your orders at 347 553-7708<br />Wishing everyone a lovely weekend.<br />Warmly, <br />Kim Joseph<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just wanted to chime in and rave about Kim&#039;s bread. I have gotten several loaves over the last three weeks, and am picking up a baker&#039;s choice loaf (Smoky Chili Tarragon) this Thursday. Each loaf has been phenomenal. My partner, a sourdough addict who was born and raised in the SF area, considers Kim&#039;s sourdough the best he&#039;s had. And I&#039;ve had a number of dinner guests who have also gone for seconds and thirds of Kim&#039;s bread.

					Just want to put in another good word for Laly&#039;s. It has become our go-to place for delivery on weekday nights when we are too busy to cook. I&#039;d estimate we&#039;ve ordered from them about ten times. The food is always warm when it arrives, despite the fact that we live a distance away (85th/35th). It is delivered promptly and is carefully packed/packaged. The owner, who usually delivers the food, is very friendly. And most importantly, the food is delicious! It is made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and is always perfectly cooked and seasoned.

					Congrats, Stew. I can&#039;t wait for the opening of STB. I knew that someone would take issue with your use of &quot;young.&quot; It&#039;s great that you care enough about your craft and your community to want to train local people, without experience, to work in high-end restaurants, and I&#039;m happy to give you the benefit of the doubt that you aren&#039;t an ageist;)

					Walked by OB around 8 pm this evening.&nbsp; They were open!&nbsp; I spoke with the friendly owner. He said it was a &quot;soft open&quot; and gave me the attached menu, which looks very promising. I can&#039;t wait to try it.&nbsp;

Many others and I, including those from out of town and friends who have not been to JH before love the food, the space, the service and the reasonable prices. As another poster said, its not meant to be a health food paradise by any means. <br /><br />Your posts have constantly come off as arrogant and condescending ever since you began touting your restaurant. Great way to gain rapport with the vast majority of the neighborhood. Perhaps you should cut your losses and try to open up in Brooklyn or some other gentrified part of NYC. I for one, will tell anyone who is curious about it how pompous, egotistic and patronizing you have been throughout. <br /><br />People like you are what are ruining this city one snooty artisanal overpriced cafe or bistro at a time. This is one of the few remaining neighborhoods in NYC that still retains an authentic feel. Good for the community board to stall your gentrification project.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m often surprised at how (and why), within a few posts, mild disagreement on this forum can turn to downright nastiness.&nbsp; If you feel someone has behaved badly, does that mean you have to go there too?<br />(My two-cents&#039; worth - OK bring it!!)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My thoughts exactly, Madalyn;)

					I hate that this has to be my first post to this site.<br /><br />Tonight, around 9PM, I was walking past the big Rite Aide on 37th. I came across a group of approximately 15-20 teenage boys, many of them on bikes, all of them wearing casual/athletic clothes.&nbsp; My guess is that they were 14-16 years of age.&nbsp; They were yelling at another young man, around their age, and appeared ready to attack him.&nbsp; I stood between the victim and the attackers, who seemed unwilling to draw away from the victim.&nbsp; They repeatedly threatened him with violence, often calling him &quot;fat ass n-----.&quot;&nbsp; Another adult appeared, and we were able to get the victim and his friend to start walking away from the group up 37th.&nbsp; As we started, one of the attackers threw a piece of lumber (approx. 2 feet long) in our direction.&nbsp; Thankfully, it didn&#039;t hit anyone.&nbsp; As we walked up 37th, about three-four of the attackers followed us by bike.&nbsp; They repeatedly made threats against the victim, and again, referred to him by the n-word.&nbsp; At one point, one of them yelled &quot;You&#039;re gonna die&nbsp; n-----&quot;&nbsp; The group headed towards 34th avenue, and I waited with the victim, his friend, and the other adult at the corner of 85th and 37th. I asked what had happened, and if victim went to school with the attackers (as I was worried about his future safety).&nbsp; The victim stated that he didn&#039;t go to school with attackers, and that the group played basketball (I don&#039;t know if they were a team, or not).&nbsp; The other adult said that he was the father or uncle (I can&#039;t remember) of the victim&#039;s friend. He called the police, who arrived shortly thereafter.&nbsp; I told the police what I witnessed and, as a lawyer with experience in law enforcement, that they should take this incident very seriously.&nbsp; I told the police the direction in which the group headed, and the victim said that the group of attackers might be headed to a park (I&#039;m not sure how he knew, or which park it was).&nbsp; The victim, his friends, and the police then left. <br /><br />As you might imagine, this was a very upsetting incident to witness.&nbsp; If I were to guess, the group of attackers were otherwise normal teens who would never act so heinously without the encouragement of a mob of their friends.&nbsp; If you think that one of the attackers is your kid, or you know someone who might be their parent, you seriously need to intervene.
