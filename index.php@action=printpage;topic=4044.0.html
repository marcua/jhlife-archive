				&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Coyote I have been making this guacamole recipe before internet existed in fact twenty six years ago the chef from Rosa Mexicano taught me how to prepare this recipe which has remained nearly the same besides the addition of garlic.&nbsp; I use a molcajete to prepare my guacamole.&nbsp; I also make my own tortilla chips. &nbsp;It&#039;s a shame that most Mexican restaurants cut corners in their guacamole which typically consists of avocado, salt and lime juice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa Mexicano is one of the top Mexican restaurants in the city. &nbsp;If you doubt my recipe then why not check out their site where you will find their guacamole recipe. &nbsp;btw this is one of the dishes that made them famous. &nbsp;But don&#039;t worry Mr. Coyote you&#039;re never too old to learn new tricks! &nbsp;:2funny:<br /><br />http://www.rosamexicano.com/ChefsCorner/Recipes/tabid/89/Default.aspx#guacamole_en_molcajete<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4044.msg26392.html#msg26392">Quote from: El Coyote restaurant on January 30, 2010, 04:32:46 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Looks Like that recipe is from interne,, At El Coyote Restaurant we served with warm soft corn tortilla,, <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				One thing I&#039;ll do if I can&#039;t find/wait for ripe avocados is slice the not-quite-ripe ones from the store to about 3/4 inch slices, and grill them (outdoors in summer out of the city, on the George Foreman grill if stuck indoors) until they&#039;re they&#039;ve softened and gotten some nice grill marks in them. Not the same as perfectly ripe, but a lot better than the hard unripe ones you get at the store.

				<strong>My Grandma used recao in all her beans and stews. &nbsp;She made &quot;recaito&#039; two or three times monthly. &nbsp;She basically added a little bit of oil, vinegar and I think a little bit of water if need to a bunch or recao in the blender. &nbsp;She added some ajis, garlic and some salt. &nbsp;I don&#039;t know her exact recipe but my sister in law started making it after she saw me do it with the cilantro. &nbsp;I use both since it&#039;s difficult to find recao on the regular. &nbsp;But IMO recao does have a more intense flavor enhancer than cilantro. &nbsp;Well, I may be partial since it just reminds me so much of my childhod years when Abuela sent me to the side of casita to pluck the leaves. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t mind, it sure beat pulling yuca, yautia &amp; malanga from the soil.. &nbsp;:2funny: </strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
