								<div class="inner" id="msg_6740">You are right 80st<br /><br />Anyone that has the luxury of time to market and sell their property should.&nbsp; But for those that have really busy lives and that luxury of time is one they don&#039;t have should of course hand it over to a broker.&nbsp; Obviously a time frame is worked out and a seller should do their homework and negotiate with someone that will look out for their interest.&nbsp; Another reason to work with a broker is the exclusive agency.&nbsp; For those that do not know what it means is that in an exclusive agency the seller can continue to market their property and at the same time sign up with a broker.&nbsp; If the seller finds a buyer then the seller owns nothing to the broker.&nbsp; If the broker sells it or anyone other than the owner of the property sells it the listing agent will still get paid upon closing.&nbsp; He may or may not have been co-brokering but that&#039;s another drama all together.<br /><br />If anyone feels compelled to market and sell their property in JH they should be able to do so fairly easily if they are below market value.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you properly qualify your buyer or are an active shareholder you will also avoid Coop Board issues. But if you are looking for market value than you must be able to be patient and make sure you get your comps from mgmt.&nbsp; As per the market today, I don&#039;t know why reports are so vague about the prices of coops vs houses.&nbsp; Coops are still selling well and the prices are not flat but merely stopped climbing out of control.&nbsp; Yes, some new developments that were priced aggressively are now having to reasses their price structure.&nbsp; <br /><br />For those that cannot continue paying the construction loans have in fact started selling to other developers at huge discounts and for those that used their own money to develop can afford to rent out many of them until such time is financially feasible once again to sell.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also to concider is that many, not all, but indeed many realtors actually have buyers waiting for specific properties in a specific neighborhood or building.&nbsp; Yes, there are many buyers out there still looking for their dream properties and a great part of them will hook up with a realtor.&nbsp; Guess what, most realtor will try to seel the units with the best commissions first,&nbsp; oooh, not pretty to say that, but as real as it gets.&nbsp; I don&#039;t list resales and I rarely market units that require Board approval but once in a while I see things <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" /> that breaks my heart.&nbsp; But&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_6926">KC,<br />It&#039;s unfortunate that you&#039;ve had bad experiences on the buying side of the equation, but let&#039;s face it, there are plenty of inexperienced real estate agents, and let&#039;s be real - they&#039;re not exclusive to big firms.&nbsp; The point I made earlier still stands.&nbsp; It is in the best interest of sellers to get the maximum exposure for their properties.&nbsp; Obviously, sellers also need to carefully discern between worthwhile and incompetent agents.&nbsp; I have nothing against the local real estate firms, however, their attempts to bar the competition yield fewer selling opportunities and ultimately lower prices - essentially, this is a disservice to the client.</div>

I have also served in the Board of Coops as treasurer and Vice President for about 7 years.&nbsp; Years later I hold consulting positions and participate in committees in buildings were I own units and even in one where I am not a shareholder.<br />&nbsp;<br />With all due respect, a realtor does not have to be a &quot;Biggie&quot; to be a member of MLS.&nbsp; It&#039;s relatively inexpensive to become a member since minimal requirements are needed to join.&nbsp; I see nothing wrong with the MLS service since I am a member and I have benefited from it&#039;s membership.&nbsp; What I am against is the falsehood and attempt to mystify membership to the MLS.&nbsp; A member of MLS realtor is not more professional or better qualified than others since professionalism and efficiency has nothing to do with membership.&nbsp; While I admit that many of the programs and services including specialized training for members are beneficial these training services are not a requirement for membership and are not free to members thus the vast majority of members will pass on the fancier training.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The training is usually designed for special certification purposes and to &quot;close the deal&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are not necessarily structured to serve the general interest of buyers or sellers.&nbsp; I have met&nbsp; plenty of unqualified, uneducated and incapable realtors as members of the MLS but this doesn&#039;t mean I am going to generalized and attempt to point the finger at those brokers that depend strictly on MLS for their business.&nbsp; When you place a property in the MLS system it&#039;s thrown into a pool of thousands of similar properties.&nbsp; The property is seen by other agents that will be able to offer it to their customer hence the &quot;best possible&quot; scenario for the seller.&nbsp; <span class="bbc_u">In &quot;THEORY&quot; on paper it works,</span> but so does communism.&nbsp; MLS is a tool and an option for realtors to help produce buyers for their listings.&nbsp; On a sellers agency side the agent is able to show the prospective buyer any available property that has been listed.&nbsp; Unfortunately many of the better properties don&#039;t hit the MLS.&nbsp; The reason for that are many.&nbsp; For one, many realtors use the system to show how much better their &quot;in-house&quot; listings are.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />A large number of realtors are uncaring to other agents time and waste it by bringing unqualified &quot;lookers&quot; or people posing as buyers.&nbsp; It&#039;s so rampant that many listings agents will simply refuse to show the properties unless their client can show proof of funds or produce a current pre-approval.&nbsp; On a number of occasions I found myself helping sellers and buyers with their coop needs by using the MLS systems.&nbsp; I was able to help and co-broke these coop units but the listing brokers were so surprised they still call me today to help them with other properties.&nbsp; MLS is specially great for other types of properties like houses, newly develop properties and of course the more difficult properties to sell.&nbsp; To successfully market and sell Coops you need a neighborhood broker. Local brokers will have a better chance to know the building, they may know the Coop members, shareholders, the super or at least are close enough to the action that they know the intricate sociopolitical foundation of the particular coop board they may be working with.&nbsp; That is something a Broker outside of the neighborhood circle cannot accomplish for you wether it&#039;s a 200 agent office or a one person team.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />So, I beg to differ when it comes to the local coop market and add that you are dead wrong, not about the MLS but about the so called &quot;BIGGIE&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;What you may not realize is that many local brokers, and you did take the liberty to name quite a few, do co-broke but on a local level, a sort of their own close knit mini MLS.&nbsp; I sold a few properties that were with some very well known realtors in Flushing and Bayside for 6 Months with no takers.&nbsp; The sellers had dealt with me on other matters and gave me a few properties to sell in JH, Corona and in Forest Hills.&nbsp; Two weeks later I had offers for all units in JH, and in Corona.&nbsp; Forest Hills was a bit tougher since it had the most available units in the market but 5 weeks later and lots of leg work produced an accepted offer. This is not a fluke and it is because I am talking about Coops.&nbsp; Granted, they were sponsor owned but since then I had found myself with well qualified buyers being turned down by coop boards because I didn&#039;t know the Board or the Mgmt or the super.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t know because I am not known by the Building and so on.&nbsp; Ever since then I have decided to hand pick those listings that may require a coop approval.&nbsp; Trust me, it can get really ugly when a realtor doesn&#039;t have a good grip of what kind of&nbsp; coop they are dealing with.<br />&nbsp;<br />Choosing to be a member of MLS should be an automatic, deciding to keep the listing in-house is the brokers and sellers business.&nbsp; The broker may know he can sell it within 21 days.&nbsp; The likelihood of an &quot;outside&quot; broker knowing what the Coop Board is looking for is slim to none whereas the local broker will easily qualify a prospective buyer.&nbsp; Why in the world would any one co-broke a listing that is a sure quick sale.&nbsp; Now, if the property is on the market for 21 days with no serious buyer or the broker knows the property is not such an easy sale then absolutely, MLS from day one. If you choose to list your property with a broker you can request that they place it on MLS as a condition to the listing and most will.&nbsp; If someone is not ready to buy and is just looking I recommend hitting the open houses and browse sites like realtor.com.&nbsp; If you are looking to buy in a specific area or in a specific bloc or building avoid the MLS stigma and simply look into sites like Backpage and Craigslist or hit the streets and walk into several local RE offices and be honest.&nbsp; Tell them that you are in the market, that you are ready and that you will visit other brokers in the area in your search.&nbsp; On a final note, GET PRE-QUALIFIED before you start making appointments and be treated like royalty.<br /><br />I will continue the posting later since I feel obligated to expand on this extremely important issue.&nbsp; I will split the posting now and later will address the several reason why a broker may decide to keep a listing in-house or place it in the MLS.&nbsp; It may bore the heck out of most but it may bring a new perspective on the realities of the market.</strong></span></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_6959">NYC Native, I tried to follow your discussion and rebuttal to jmp99â€™s post.&nbsp; <br /><br />From my reading, jmp99â€™s overall suggestion to sellers is to maximize their sale price AND decrease time on the market by exposing the property to the most number of potential buyers.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, jmp99 suggested utilizing the service of larger real estate agencies that are willing to share the commission with any broker.<br /><br />With all due respect to you, jmp99â€™s post did not state that only realtors from the larger agencies can become a member of the multiple listing service (MLS).&nbsp; In fact, unless Iâ€™m mistaken, jmp99â€™s post did not discuss the MLS at all.&nbsp; Therefore, your lengthy critique of the MLS is probably not that relevant (perhaps even irrelevant) to your rebuttal to jmp99â€™s post.<br /><br />However, since you did post some of your opinions regarding the MLS, I will also jump in with my thoughts on the subject.&nbsp; You stated that you were against â€œthe falsehood and attempt to mystify membership to the MLSâ€.&nbsp; While I can certainly see that MLS realtors may not be any more professional than those not on the MLS, I believe (and correct me if Iâ€™m wrong), the chief criticism of the MLS from the consumer standpoint is the very anticompetitive nature in which they are set up.&nbsp; More than a few MLS systems have been targets of federal antitrust law suits because of their anticompetitive nature that renders a great disservice to consumers.&nbsp; Agents willing to take smaller commissions have been barred from the MLS, along with agents willing to provide less than the full range of service typically provided by realtors.&nbsp; Internet-based real estate agencies have also been barred from joining the MLS.&nbsp; All this seems to be missing from your critique of the MLS.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, I donâ€™t really see your point about jmp99 being â€œdead wrongâ€ about local realtorâ€™s unwillingness to work with other real estate agents and their desire to keep the full commission.&nbsp; You stated yourself that local realtors co-broker properties but only with other local brokers.&nbsp; This seems to the PERFECT example of the anti-competitive nature of local real estate agents that jmp99 is complaining about!&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I wonder how many local real estate agents go to the trouble of explaining to their client (the seller) that the agent will go ahead and screen out any offers (regardless of the quality of the offer) or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by the few local agencies in JH.&nbsp; That hardly seems in line with a real estate agentâ€™s fiduciary duty to a client-seller, unless it is fully disclosed up front.&nbsp; HOW MANY SELLERS WOULD BE WILLING TO IGNORE AN OFFER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WASNâ€™T BROUGHT TO THEM BY A LOCAL REALTOR?&nbsp; I CERTAINLY WOULDNâ€™T!<br /><br />I also disagree with your defense of local real estate agents over agents from larger city-wide agencies.&nbsp; There are certainly some agents from larger agencies that are simply clueless, but I just donâ€™t see the supposed advantage that local brokers can provide.&nbsp; You seem to suggest that local brokers have the inside scoop on buildings and will somehow make the sale go smoothly.&nbsp; Speaking as a co-op board member myself, I think that is a much too generous advantage you seem to award yourself.&nbsp; A prospective buyerâ€™s financials comes first and will always be paramount in my building.&nbsp; No real estate agent can miraculously help the process in my opinion when it comes to a prospective buyerâ€™s financialsâ€¦no matter what kind of inside scoop they think they might be in possession of.&nbsp; Also, being pre-qualified means nothing to a co-op board.&nbsp; It may indicate to an agent that a prospective buyer is serious, but a year ago, even a door-knob can get pre-qualifiedâ€¦that has no bearing on a buyerâ€™s ability to pay his/her mortgage!&nbsp; Therefore, the advantages that a local real estate agent may provide in terms of his ability to get the inside scoop is minimal at best!&nbsp; A hard-working agent from the larger agencies can get a hold of such information too!<br /><br />Your arguments seem largely based on what is good for you and other local brokers.&nbsp; As jmp99 points out, YOUR INTERESTS AS A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH A SELLERâ€™S INTEREST!&nbsp; It might be a terrible waste of your time and resources to show an apartment to someone who is only window shopping or not pre-qualified, but a seller really cares primarily about getting the highest price in the least amount of time!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></div>

That case was scheduled to go to trial in Chicago in July.<br /><br />The settlement â€œis a win for consumers, certainly, who will now have the benefit of unrestricted competition,â€ Deborah A. Garza, deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in an interview. â€œThere inevitably will be more efficiency and more competition in the market.â€<br /><br />Real estate agents earned $93 billion in commissions in 2006, with a median commission of about $11,600, Justice Department officials said. Internet brokers, offering pared-down services, provided average rebates of 1 percent on commissions that normally ran 5 or 6 percent, translating into thousands of dollars per sale.<br /><br />Consumer advocates hailed the settlement as an important and somewhat surprising step by the Bush administration, which has staked out a position on many antitrust issues seen as favorable to business interests. <br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em></div>

<br /><br />From my reading, jmp99â€™s overall suggestion to sellers is to maximize their sale price AND decrease time on the market by exposing the property to the most number of potential buyers.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, jmp99 suggested utilizing the service of larger real estate agencies that are willing to share the commission with any broker.<br /><br />With all due respect to you, jmp99â€™s post did not state that only realtors from the larger agencies can become a member of the multiple listing service (MLS).&nbsp; In fact, unless Iâ€™m mistaken, jmp99â€™s post did not discuss the MLS at all.&nbsp; Therefore, your lengthy critique of the MLS is probably not that relevant (perhaps even irrelevant) to your rebuttal to jmp99â€™s post.<br /><br />However, since you did post some of your opinions regarding the MLS, I will also jump in with my thoughts on the subject.&nbsp; You stated that you were against â€œthe falsehood and attempt to mystify membership to the MLSâ€.&nbsp; While I can certainly see that MLS realtors may not be any more professional than those not on the MLS, I believe (and correct me if Iâ€™m wrong), the chief criticism of the MLS from the consumer standpoint is the very anticompetitive nature in which they are set up.&nbsp; More than a few MLS systems have been targets of federal antitrust law suits because of their anticompetitive nature that renders a great disservice to consumers.&nbsp; Agents willing to take smaller commissions have been barred from the MLS, along with agents willing to provide less than the full range of service typically provided by realtors.&nbsp; Internet-based real estate agencies have also been barred from joining the MLS.&nbsp; All this seems to be missing from your critique of the MLS.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, I donâ€™t really see your point about jmp99 being â€œdead wrongâ€ about local realtorâ€™s unwillingness to work with other real estate agents and their desire to keep the full commission.&nbsp; You stated yourself that local realtors co-broker properties but only with other local brokers.&nbsp; This seems to the PERFECT example of the anti-competitive nature of local real estate agents that jmp99 is complaining about!&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I wonder how many local real estate agents go to the trouble of explaining to their client (the seller) that the agent will go ahead and screen out any offers (regardless of the quality of the offer) or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by the few local agencies in JH.&nbsp; That hardly seems in line with a real estate agentâ€™s fiduciary duty to a client-seller, unless it is fully disclosed up front.&nbsp; HOW MANY SELLERS WOULD BE WILLING TO IGNORE AN OFFER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WASNâ€™T BROUGHT TO THEM BY A LOCAL REALTOR?&nbsp; I CERTAINLY WOULDNâ€™T!<br /><br />I also disagree with your defense of local real estate agents over agents from larger city-wide agencies.&nbsp; There are certainly some agents from larger agencies that are simply clueless, but I just donâ€™t see the supposed advantage that local brokers can provide.&nbsp; You seem to suggest that local brokers have the inside scoop on buildings and will somehow make the sale go smoothly.&nbsp; Speaking as a co-op board member myself, I think that is a much too generous advantage you seem to award yourself.&nbsp; A prospective buyerâ€™s financials comes first and will always be paramount in my building.&nbsp; No real estate agent can miraculously help the process in my opinion when it comes to a prospective buyerâ€™s financialsâ€¦no matter what kind of inside scoop they think they might be in possession of.&nbsp; Also, being pre-qualified means nothing to a co-op board.&nbsp; It may indicate to an agent that a prospective buyer is serious, but a year ago, even a door-knob can get pre-qualifiedâ€¦that has no bearing on a buyerâ€™s ability to pay his/her mortgage!&nbsp; Therefore, the advantages that a local real estate agent may provide in terms of his ability to get the inside scoop is minimal at best!&nbsp; A hard-working agent from the larger agencies can get a hold of such information too!<br /><br />Your arguments seem largely based on what is good for you and other local brokers.&nbsp; As jmp99 points out, YOUR INTERESTS AS A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH A SELLERâ€™S INTEREST!&nbsp; It might be a terrible waste of your time and resources to show an apartment to someone who is only window shopping or not pre-qualified, but a seller really cares primarily about getting the highest price in the least amount of time!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><span style="color: navy;" class="bbc_color"><em><strong><br />80Th street.observer, I should have started my posting with &quot;when you say co-broke I am assuming you are indicating that most JH realtors refuse to use the MLS system to list their properties.&quot; I read between the lines and if someone reads the posting and sees it differently than I did then you are right about jmp99&nbsp; not using the word MLS.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to see different angles of things and I saw it on the angle of an experience COOP agent and ex-board member of several buildings.&nbsp; JMP99 makes general mention of agents, using their names in a manner I feel was a bit unfair to them. JMP99 does make a statement about co-brokering that as I mentioned, in theory works best to secure the highest offer possible for the seller and ultimately benefits the Industry&nbsp; In the businesses that I am involved in it would be unforgivable to simply start naming other realtors or environmental/construction firms in an attempt to trash them.&nbsp; Many may not agree, but that&#039;s what opinions are about.<br /><br />I think 80thstreet got what 80thstreet got out of the posting and it&#039;s OK.&nbsp; I think that my rebut touched on too many issues and I did not address the issue specifically. I also failed to quote JMP99 so that the &quot;loss in translation&quot; was evident.&nbsp; There is such a thing as too long a posting and I certainly crossed that line a long time ago...LOL&nbsp; It would take a whole lot of witting to get my views understood and even then, unless you have been there it may still be foggy. Ever heard of &quot;reading between the lines?&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly what I did and I felt it necessary to unmask the posting for what I believe it really was and I will not apologize for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets&#039; start with the co-broker or cooperating broker and the antitrust mentioned.&nbsp; By JMP99 stating that the mentioned local agents do not co-broke JMP99 simply showed disregard and in my opinion total disrespect for these hard working local brokers.&nbsp; Many of these agents co-broke but instead of putting it up in the MLS (in this case or Queens LIBOR) they choose not to waste their time and go right to the source...LOCAL REALTORS THAT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE QUALIFIED AND SERIOUS, READY TO DEAL BUYERS, NOT POSERS. I also wrote that many realtors will ask that their buyers show proof of funds and / or a pre-qualification before they show.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about that, regardless of what you may have been led to believe (am I reading between the lines???)&nbsp; I also think that any realtor showing properties to buyers of other agents without a pre-qualification letter or proof of funds is simply not looking out for the best interest of their clients and is setting themselves up for a whole list of abuse in the business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now going into giving myself credit...again what I posted was that I witnessed the abuses of Board and that unfortunately many local realtors have an edge over the &quot;outsider&quot;.&nbsp; As a byproduct of my posting I did many things but giving myself any credit was one thing I did not...LOL.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see, if I wanted to give myself credit I would have posted something like...&quot;list with me, I will find a buyer and I will get him approved by your Board&quot;...Now that would be crazy talk 80thstreet.&nbsp; In fact, I want to repeat that I GENERALLY DON&#039;T LIST PROPERTIES UNLESS THEY ARE SPONSOR OWNED UNITS.&nbsp; On occasion I will list a resale but only if I know the Board is fair and I am confident I can get someone approved without racism or prejudicial elements.&nbsp; Your building may follow a fair and level SOP for allowing shareholders but the realities of many other buildings differ from yours.&nbsp; I will not name certain Buildings because then I would be doing the same thing I posted against, posting names as if that would have no repercussions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am totally aware that different Coops observe different requirements but even then not knowing the Building can complicate matters. Yes, many Coop Boards are as fair as can be but many, and I mean many are guilty as charge.&nbsp; I believe that I made it clear that I have found myself hand picking resales because these practices are still rampant. I can write, not one posting but a books worth of the abuses that still exist in several Cooperatives.&nbsp; I have to admit that JH Cooperatives are a lot more compliant to the federal laws as it pertains to the &quot;protected classes&quot; but we are still a long way from equality and a level play field.<br /><br />Finally (for now, I think 80thstreet is going to keep me busy and 80thstreet did bring valid points to this subject) IT IS MY OPINION BASED ON CERTAIN REALITIES, it is better to know someone in the Board, or the Mgmt or at least some other shareholders that can expand your knowledge of the Building.&nbsp; This is important because offering plans, amendments, house rules and the financials are not going to tell you anything about the Building&#039;s admissions committee.&nbsp; Based on this very personal opinion that is something that is not likely to be happen with an outside broker. </strong> </em> </span> </div>
