				so we just had our first delivery experience from Black Thai, mixed, leaning towards the positive. we ordered:<br /><br />Duck Wrap: duck, pickled veggies that could double for banh mi fixins and hoisin sauce in a flaky roti. i&#039;d have liked a little more pickle in the veg, but the portion of duck was generous, and well cooked.<br /><br />Black Thai Salad: a sort of chicken larb with a few additions. way, way too bland. ground chicken needs a whole lot more than just a little lime juice to make it palatable.<br /><br />Pad Prig Khing: we got a chicken version. this had all the kick the salad was missing. slow burn spicy, really well cooked string beans and a nice sauce.<br /><br />Drunken Noodles: pork version. not as saucy as some i&#039;ve had. good pork to noodle ratio, just enough veggies to make you feel moderately virtuous. oddly, this dish is usually very spicy, but only hit a few hot notes.<br /><br />overall, i&#039;d try a few more things. they have a few fish dishes on the menu that look good, but at 20 bucks a pop (not bad for a whole fish, really), we wanted to test the waters on the lower end of the price scale first.

				I just finished dinner from there. Bottom line: it was ok. <br /><br />Fast delivery, polite delivery person, and he was able to find my door, something that some other deliverers can&#039;t seem to figure out. <br /><br />Food is relatively expensive, and just not that great. <br />Chicken Lettuce Wrap was very good, best thing we had. Hoisin sauce was great. <br />Fried tofu was watery. <br />Pad See Ew was ok.<br />Thai Rama was fair. &quot;Mixed vegetables&quot; apparently means cabbage and onion. <br />Pineapple fried rice was a bit bland. <br />Jasmine rice was dry. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there are exactly zero other Thai delivery options for me, so I will probably order from them again. <br /><br />

				Having shared that first delivery order with dssjh, I&#039;d have to say my opinion is somewhere between theirs and yours, superclam.<br />Agreed about the duck, though I preferred the drunken noodles to the pad prig khing, personally.<br />There was a general lack of vibrancy that the better Thai dishes in the neighborhood have, but I suspect with a few things on hand at home, we can doctor them a bit. It was a meal where the engines warmed up, but takeoff speed was never achieved.<br />The price point doesn&#039;t make it as attractive, as there&#039;s better for similar or lower prices. <br />It wasn&#039;t bad, by any means, but we&#039;re close enough to have Ayada and Arunee as options (wish we could do some sort of delivery relay system for folks like yourself just out of range).

				I went passed around 7 on Thursday and it was completely shuttered. Has anyone actually seen it open? Maybe they just do takeout business. Odd.<br />Thursday night Bocaito was totally empty, Black Thai was shuttered and El Coyote was very busy but with some open tables but no one seemed to notice 2 customers standing waiting to be seated.<br />We went home and ordered take out from Tomo.

				I&#039;ve also wondered about when this place is actually open. I&#039;ve passed by on different days at different times of the day and it&#039;s always been closed. I live right around the corner, so I have been trying to get a glimpse of the inside for a while. That said, a stack of menus was dropped off in the lobby of my building this week and according to the menu they&#039;re open from 11am-11pm everyday.

				I&#039;ve ordered delivery from Black Thai twice now via Seamless; both times the food was great- I&#039;ve had the steamed dumplings, prawn chips, pad ka prow, and ginger stirfry (i can&#039;t remember the Thai for that one...). The spice level was spot on.

				dssjh, I&#039;m also puzzled. Perhaps Northern is neither hoodish or local. Or maybe it&#039;s both and we are behind the Lingo Times.<br />Ordering from some place with a serious metal grill on the front is a great leap of faith. Menus under the door or not.

				i didn&#039;t actually know we were taking a leap of faith....living on 35th in the 70s, i don&#039;t walk up northern all that often, so i had no idea they weren&#039;t &#039;official&#039; yet. the food was okay, but we just ordered from kitchen 79 tonight and it was much better. not quite sripraphai or ayada (my two local favorites), but very, very good.

				Visited Black Thai last week - and I recommend it!&nbsp; Many of the entrees at around $10.&nbsp; The decor is charming.&nbsp; The service was great and the food was excellent.&nbsp; No liquor license yet.&nbsp; Worth a walk to Northern, and an excellent addition to Northern.

				&nbsp;A little late to the party but we tried Black Thai the other night and thought it was quite good. Nothing exotic but well prepared<br />and good portions. Would enter as a definite in our reliable food menus category.
