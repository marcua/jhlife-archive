				the 2 dudes that are always on the corner of 79th and Roosevelt, as seen on google maps.&nbsp; they send a never ending parade of young Hispanic men into the parking lot behind kitchen 79.&nbsp; The sheer number of men they send back there, plus the quick turnaround time.&nbsp; has to be drugs.&nbsp;

I agree on all counts except maybe the PS 69 flea market...that&#039;s actually cute and I don&#039;t mind it. Here&#039;s other things:<br /><br />- Roosevelt Avenue needs a BID. I don&#039;t care that Queens United or that other scrappy little &quot;activist&quot; groups hate it. Roosevelt is an embarassing dump and needs a complete overhaul. Our local politicians should fight for the betterment of the community.<br />- All of these soliciting massage parlors should immediately be shut down and their licenses revoked. Also, there should be no new licenses issued, effective immediately.<br />- Honestly, until Roosevelt Ave can get its act together, there should be an immediate ban on new liquor licenses for establishments on Roosevelt as well.<br />- Would love to fight for some beautification efforts along Northern Blvd when they reimagine traffic flow<br />- 37th Avenue needs some help too, but chiefly, elected officials should be on the forefront of attracting new and vibrant businesses there so that we cut down on the amount of empty stores (and cheap junky stores too).<br />

				I have mentioned this before I suppose what was in Times Square before the massive clean-up... moved to Roosevelt Ave to create the Roosevelt Ave Red Light District...which is what&#039;s there now. <br /><br />4th Ave in Brooklyn (Sunset Park) was also a kinda Red Light District when I lived in Brooklyn 10 years ago.<br /><br />But because of Industry City etc, the Red Light District in Sunset Park is completely gone now.<br /><br />In a way, Sunset Park, Brooklyn is a similar neighborhood to Jackson Heights. Diverse, immigrant, relatively affordable. <br /><br />Amazon being here might&#039;ve got rid of the Red Light District. But we&#039;ll never know. <br /><br />It&#039;s interesting gentrification does get rid of Red Light Districts.&nbsp; And the downside is prices rise as the ares become more desirable by the wealthier. That&#039;s the inherent tension. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				These are all great suggestions. Unfortunately, the business lobby in JH is very strong. The Roosevelt Ave merchants definitely have the ear of the pols as do the merchants around Diversity Plaza.<br /><br />If we want change we have to show up en masse at community meetings. I was at one about a year ago which focused on community policing and someone complained about the endless piles of garbage on 73rd and 74th Sts and one of the merchants was there who said he represented a merchants group. He immediately rose to say it&#039;s not the merchants fault, that people dump garbage there. That may be true but it shouldn&#039;t matter. If it&#039;s in front of your store you ought to clean it up.<br /><br />Ditto on double parking all over. The merchants don&#039;t want their customers ticketed. It&#039;s bad for business. Clogged streets are good for business, in their view.<br /><br /><br />

It sounds like a lot of us are on the same page, but the problem is that 1. we&#039;re not organized and 2. we stay silent. Jackson Heights Life is an amazing forum, but I think we should all make our voices heard. I&#039;m not sure how to do this - do we start our own community activist group?? <br /><br />It starts with letter-writing, 311 calls, and calls to elected officials. 311 is particularly useful for trash/noise complaints.

You&#039;ve never eaten food from a truck? You&#039;ve never bought produce from the guys on 75th and Roosevelt or 82nd or 37th? Should we boot the guy selling books on 37th and 81st? How about the juice trucks? Do they make the cut?<br /><br />4) I believe the flea market outside PS69 is a fundraiser. You want to deny money to the PTA? The people selling on 37th and 82nd are obviously doing some business or they wouldn&#039;t be there. That&#039;s how the free market works.

				Don&#039;t even get me started on Queens Barrios/United. They are a hateful group. Have you ever seen their posts on FB? They are unbelievable. They are fighting for all the most backwards things, I agree with you ABC, it&#039;s the ultimate irony.&nbsp; I suspect many of us feel differently than they do, but we&#039;re not out there making noise, filing frivolous court cases, or hitting Jeff Bezos pinatas.&nbsp; Until we mobilize to shout louder than they do, they&#039;ll continue to claim that they &quot;represent&quot; Queens.

				Still amazed. And can&#039;t quite believe it.<br /><br />So, I have to repeat it to myself.<br /><br />The sex worker industry is being promoted. Thus jobs in the sex industry are being encouraged.<br /><br />And any job in Amazon etc is being denigrated. <br /><br />Thus aspirations for women (and men too) are for the sex industry. And that is what is being touted as good for the culture/future for Queens?<br /><br />Looks like we will become that touristy RED LIGHT DISTRICT ( as in Amsterdam) after all! I was half-kidding in previous posts but it is coming true!<br /><br />I understand now. These groups appear to hold the political power (via Jessica Ramos/AOC) in the borough. <br /><br />There is a blindness over how perverse this logic is. Fear of change has twisted a sense of ethics.&nbsp; <br />

				The bill to decriminalize sex work makes it illegal to punish customers, not just sex workers&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s why it is opposed by some feminists, who rallied against it not long ago, as noted here: https://carolynmaloney.com/the-feminist-divide-over-decriminalizing-sex-work/&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />It is difficult for me to envision how the bill Ramos is supporting will stop the sex trade in JH. If anything, it will make the street scene after midnight more sleazy.&nbsp; It&#039;s been widely acknowledged that creating the Red Light district in Amsterdam, where prostitution is legal and regulated by the government, was a well-intentioned mistake and it is going to be abolished.&nbsp;

				Both those tweets were retweets by Queens Neighborhoods United, which is QueensBarrios. There are many groups, fluid and flux and purposefully confusing. QNU acts as the umbrella for smaller groups, but is the grassroots of the democratic socialists. However, DSA deliberately distances and obscures the relationships. <br /><br />So yes, AOC.

				I realize that some folks have already twisted my original post into a racial argument. Whatever. But the point of it was that JHLife members were specifically blaming the cops for not doing their job and in some instances if I recall correctly, participating in the crimes.<br /><br />The tweets I posted show evidence of why that may not be the case.
