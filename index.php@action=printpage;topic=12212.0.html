				Thanks for the link.&nbsp; What I&#039;m interested in knowing is if this kind of over-bidding is becoming common in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; I&#039;m really surprised that an apartment listed at $285K went for $336K!<br /><br />I have noticed that some of the apartments on jacksonheightslistings.com have gone for over asking, but I don&#039;t think by such a large percentage.&nbsp; This was listed at $327K and went for $350K. http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-21-79th-street-2-bedroom/

				As a Realtor working mostly in Jackson Heights (I live here), I can say that there has been a surge in sales price this spring and summer particularly in 2 BR listings.<br /><br />In June I listed a 2BR in a well-kept building just one street outside of the Historic District. The sellers were motivated so I listed it for an attractive price in the 380&#039;s. The day it hit the MLS calls started flooding in. When it was on Trulia and Zillow a day later things really went nuts. There were many offers over list price and in four days the sellers had accepted a cash offer in the 400&#039;s, very close to 10% over list. It&#039;s now under contract at that price.<br /><br />So yes, JH is drawing attention as a great alternative to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Buyers get more space and spend less money and are discovering what this neighborhood really has to offer as a wonderful place to live. <br /><br />Ellen Pratt<br />Licensed Sales Associate<br />Rock Realty<br />75-47 31st Ave<br />Jackson Heights NY 11370<br />Cell/Text 434-989-7068<br />Direct: 718-440-9458<br />ellenwpratt@gmail.com<br />

				I remember this deal well, the outbid cash buyer mentioned in the article was our client. I can tell you that he was over ask, but not that far over ask. Finishes we&#039;re good but low grade, so we didn&#039;t feel comfortable going higher. Few months before that we listed and sold a 1 bedroom with high grade finishes just a block away from this property for $318k in a post war building. These are just early indicators of what we&#039;ve been predicting since 2012.<br /><br />www.jacksonheightslistings.com<br />

				Lilybell, I&#039;m curious... were there any signs before the red herring that your landlord was considering a conversion? I&#039;ve heard rumors that mine was considering that for our building. I&#039;m hoping we can move into a two-bedroom before it happens (if it really is going to happen).

				ANY capital improvements recently made by your rental landlord should make you wonder if they are not about to attempt a conversion to a coop. Back in the early 80s, just about EVERY apartment complex in Queens that converted had three tell-tale signs:<br /><br />1. New windows<br />2. Upgraded elevators and lobbys<br />3. New laundry rooms

				Interesting, I wonder what the tell-tale signs of redevelopment are? Curious to see what is in the future for Diversity Plaza. The Duane Reade on 74th and this NYT article would portend positive things for that part of JH, I hope. <br /><br />In any case, it&#039;s always exciting to see JH getting attention.
