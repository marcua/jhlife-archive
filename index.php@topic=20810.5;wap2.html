			<br />--- Quote from: itsit on December 28, 2021, 12:18:22 PM --- Yeah. We have so many bored tweens here in JH. Some on this board and they&#039;ll like it. Meanwhile Heather Cox Richardson on Substack is a thought provoking read. Nice to be outside the traditional machinery of news and commentary which is something I appreciated from this soon to be gone site.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />My observation of this forum is that it&#039;s far more opinions on topics rather than any real news.<br /><br />Which is fine.<br /><br />But individuals&#039; opinions being confused with actual news... is not so great.

			is there a single neighborhood chat board anywhere in North America that&#039;s focused on real news?&nbsp;

			here&#039;s an instance where i wish the forum would have had a simple agree/disagree option. because you&#039;re correct, and there&#039;s really not much else to add.

			This is the first and only forum I have ever been a part of.<br /><br />And as such, I reiterate, that this forum has taught me so much about the inner online thought processes of people, opinions, anger, kindness, group-speak and human flaws. <br /><br />Thank you again to the moderators for this incredible learning curve on online protocol and behavior.<br /><br />I leave the forum far wiser and much more knowledgeable about the online world than when I started. <br /><br />And I take that into the future. <br /><br />Much appreciated!<br /><br />&nbsp;
