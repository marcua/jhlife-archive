				Anyone have any other solutions to my $350 a month TWC bill?&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked into dish, but I&#039;m not in line of sight. I have two modems, so that may have something to do with it. And that&#039;s on top of my $250 a month for my Verizon cell phone, which has 4 lines and I&#039;m not really complaining about that, but combined its 600 a month.

				Check your bill, call them if necessary, and figure out what you&#039;re paying for that you can cut.&nbsp; If you&#039;re paying $350 a month it&#039;s not just the two modems, it&#039;s probably a lot of extra channels.

				wow that is a lot to spend. Have you looked into Verizon fios? we have one modem, (you could probably buy your own) and five boxes with all the channels and dvr, landline phone and internet and spend around 250. Tmobile has a new &quot;one&quot; plan where you get up to four lines for $160 total and that includes everything-even tax!!

				that does seem like a lot. we have high speed, upgraded internet, landline service and the &quot;ultimate package&quot; of tv channels (basically &quot;the works&quot;) and it&#039;s around $250. just one modem, though.

				I believe I have the same &quot;ultimate package&quot; as you dssjh for @ $184 per month........and I thought that was ridiculously high!&nbsp; You&#039;ve got to be vigilant with them every year refusing to pay their yearly 5% increase.&nbsp; With the switch to Spectrum.......who knows what will happen.

				Lots of people are cutting the cord. Just get internet ($60/month all in from TWC for 100/10MBS), get netflix and amazon prime and buy a chromecast or amazon tv (total:$13/month).&nbsp; How much tv/landline do you really watch and is it worth $75/month?<br /><br />http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/how-to-cut-the-cord-and-what-to-do-if-you-cant/<br /><br />If you must keep cable tv: Buy modems/routers don&#039;t rent them.

				We found that going to the TWC store and threatening to leave them garners a discount - there is actually quite a bit of flexibility in what they charge, and they can charge you less, but you must ask.&nbsp; Going through the phone always resulted in promises that didn&#039;t always materialize.&nbsp; Happily I now have Verizon which costs more but does not drop connection as TWC did.

				You can get Earthlink too. Mine is at around $40 a month just for internet and I bought my own modem off amazon --- no worries.

A lot of people forget that over the air TV even exists because they&#039;ve been paying for cable for decades.

				FIOS puts the fear of god in them, but unfortunately Verizon has been dragging their feet with the rollout in JH.&nbsp; Grrr.&nbsp; I only have internet with TWC but was looking in to adding basic tv but there&#039;s no way I&#039;m going to pay what they want for it and I sure as hell won&#039;t get phone service with them given how unreliable they&#039;ve been.
