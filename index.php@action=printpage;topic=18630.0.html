				Financially I feel very close to retirement but I want to make sure I don&#039;t pull the plug too early and get bored.&nbsp; I am closing in on 61 and want to scale back since I have been a department head in Financial Services for over 20 years and I want less stress and more time to myself.&nbsp; Is there anyone else who is retired or nearing retirement and can share there experiences or their fears/expectations about retirement?&nbsp; I moved from JH to Bayside&nbsp; several years ago because commuting on public transportation to our jobs in Eastern Queens/LI&nbsp; was not easy&nbsp; from JH because of parking.&nbsp; I love both Bayside and JH ( frequent it often) but I am not sure I will stay in NYC forever because of the taxes.&nbsp; Would love to hear your thoughts/experiences.

				Itâ€™s too bad that this thread did have any replies.&nbsp; I am In a similar situation, because at 59.5 I stopped working, and decided to try retirement.&nbsp; <br />There are so many variables, so there is not one answer that will work for everyone, but I am planning on living on about 85% of my last salary, and as the years go on I will eventually start to collect SS.&nbsp; <br />

				I retired last year and love it.&nbsp; I am very active with the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, local schools and in local politics, so I am still very busy.&nbsp; Less money, but more control over my day
