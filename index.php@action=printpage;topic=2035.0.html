				Very funny, I always wonder what&#039;s going on at home while I&#039;m out.

				That video is adorable!<br /><br />This thread brings back memories of when my husband and I decided to videotape our first dog while we were out.&nbsp; We had her confined to a specific area in our apartment, so it was easy to position the video camera to catch all her activity.&nbsp; While we were out for approximately 2 hours, she went about jumping the safety gate we had installed in order to prevent her access to the kitchen.&nbsp; She was a small dog, so it was amazing to see how she managed to climb over the gate and then climb back.&nbsp; The camera also caught her repeatedly sniffing our shoes and then napping by them.<br /><br />I now realize how it&#039;s possible for a dog to easily get in trouble when not supervised.&nbsp; My current dog has a crate that we used when she was a pup, and to date she remains comfortable with it.&nbsp; We haven&#039;t had to place her in the crate when we leave her alone, yet when we return, we find her stretching as she comes out to greet us.
