					So, Jadasie, can you answer my question? I&#039;m happy to help the baggers unionize, but I still need to know whether they&#039;re getting paid at all. To follow-up on your generalization about posters here, the problem with ideology-driven arguments is that they often overlook the discussion at-hand in order to make a point.

					Thanks for the thread about the tipping protocol for building supers and others. That&#039;s what I love about this online community, which mimics something organic and old-time. You could live here for a hundred years and still not know anyone. Online here, more questions are raised and answered than I&#039;d ever have time to think of myself, so thanks for that. That tipping thread is only an example.&nbsp; So, thanks for all that...<br /><br />Now, what I&#039;m curious about are the grocery workers, especially at Trade Fair.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the situation is? Is it just that the management there allows them to ask for tips (I don&#039;t see this at the Met, for example) and before I make any assumptions I&#039;m seeking some information/assistance in seeking information about what the deal is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still have a recurring dream about working for 3.25 an hour as a grocery store bagger when I was in high school (and until I was 18 when as a cashier I could make more than the 3.75 an hour ceiling for baggers). My students are shocked to hear how much I made from age 15-18 (1983-85). Once I turned 18 about three years later, I was promoted to cashier (and immediately quit, since freedom to wander off, collect carts, do carry-outs, etc., was a perk work preserving when compared to the responsibilities of being a cashier). My students are shocked but the truth is that 3.50 or so per hour back then was more in real dollars than 7 and change is now. For example, fuel was under a dollar a gallon, for just one misleading indicator.<br /><br />Back to the Trade Fair workers.&nbsp; I read somewhere about a suit filed on behalf of workers at a Brooklyn grocery store for some situation where they were not being properly compensated -- Does anyone know what I&#039;m talking about?&nbsp; I don&#039;t assume that this is the case here, but that&#039;s why I&#039;d like to know what others here know about this...&nbsp; <br /><br />Generally, it&#039;s my policy to tip well and tip often, especially pizza workers, baristas, and others whose incomes need community supplement since I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s difficult as a small business owner to pay what is proper and fair--I&#039;m not apologizing for them but rather for the market-based system, which I loathe. <br /><br />Any thoughts?&nbsp; I know what the Living Wage is, so once I get some proper information I may come back around with something about that... But first, as Tony T says, &quot;just the facts.&quot; Well, if you have some facts, please share...<br /><br />

					Does anyone know what was up last evening down by 87th Street/37th Ave? <br /><br />In honor of my people back in Hamtramck, I went down to the new Polish deli (recently described in a food/restraurant thread on this site), and the lights on that block were out. Before I went in to find the worried owners sitting there in the dark, there was a tremendous booming sound, which seemed like an explosion but was described a few minutes later as a truck falling over (?). Inside the restaurant, and while they scooped up from stuffed cabbage and rice for me in total darkness, they described being able to hear the fire under their feet and other loud &quot;explosions.&quot;<br /><br />When I left, I peeked down 87 and the street was filled with thick smoke. Con Ed trucks were everywhere, mixed in with NYPD and NYFD trucks.<br /><br />I heard a helicopter overhead later, but was never verified if that was an emergency services aircraft or news.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two thumbs up on the good food. I promise to go back in the light.

					Chuckster,<br /><br />I&#039;m responding publicly in case you are not the only one.<br />Are you still having problems? &nbsp;There was a problem early in the day yesterday but it should be fine now. Make sure you have flash player plugin for your browser--try any video at YouTube or BlipTV and if you are only having problems with this one video please let me know -- PM me and I will see what I can do to help... If you&#039;re having trouble with more than just that video, try another browser or make sure the Flash player is up-to-date. If its only this video it would help to know what browser and version you are using and what OS. &nbsp;Thanks......<br /><br />And Jeffsayyes, I think it was you who did a walk-around bit of photography about the mess on 73rd Road, etc. If you -- or anyone else -- would like to be interviewed, or participate in doing some photography/video/sound/etc. for a short piece about the myriad issues (from the issues raised in the press conference to those raised over the summer involving garbage, homelessness, the Eagle), please contact me. &nbsp;I&#039;m looking to do this piece in the next short while and would love to have the participation of members of this board. &nbsp;<br /><br />--Jimmius of Chinchinuppus

					Tony T, do you have any new turds in mind?&nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed when you joined JHL on November 3, you were calling for &quot;anything but Dems and Repubs&quot; and I&#039;m curious who you would support, since there is still time to find a 3rd party candidate, or better challengers to Monserrate within the Democratic Party. For example, are you looking at right-leaning parties, left, or crank candidates or boutique ones? I don&#039;t disagree with your basic premise (that politicians as a class are quite odious--something I would say of my own profession, teachers, btw), but wonder if you have any ideas or alternatives. Sometimes it feels like we have no options and are always choosing the lesser of the &quot;two evils.&quot; Since moving to Jackson Heights in 2006, I&#039;ve been happy to find folks like Dromm and Peralta who are receptive to input from the community. They seem ever-present to me. I always see Peralta on 37th Avenue and unlike some other people, he doesn&#039;t always travel like some thug with an entourage. <br /><br />My union is considering adding &quot;access&quot; to the criteria, like voting records, when making endorsements (and therefore contributions). I&#039;ve found these two (Dromm and Peralta) to be much better than what I was used to, and we alll know about Sears and her terrible record on constituent services. I&#039;m sure Dromm is putting into place a strong community function, something Sears couldn&#039;t do given that her backers were not members of the community.<br /><br />IN ANY EVENT,<br />I&#039;d like to call the question, and so given the choice between Monserrate and Peralta, I&#039;ll put my chips in with Mr. Peralta. If he&#039;s guilty of a crime, I&#039;ll go sing carols outside his cell block. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to be necessary, LOL, so your hyperbole, &quot;I think an arrest is iminent (sic)&quot; seems oddly partisan. If it&#039;s not, fine...<br /><br />Given the choice, would you back Monserrate over Peralta? It would be useful to know when reading your future posts, since Mr. Monserrate&#039;s crimes are already proven while even constructing <span class="bbc_u">allegations</span> against Mr. Peralta out of innuendo and shady &quot;investigative reporting&quot; is extremely premature. If you read the article without the angle you already brought to the table you might, like Shelby2 apparently, and me, at least, find something else stinks here and it isn&#039;t Mr. Peralta. In that first post of yours, you suggest there is evidence to be found in campaign filings. So, given that statement, and these new allegations, care to break any news here? Seems like you know something the authorities don&#039;t, and so I, as an &quot;investigative reporter&quot; myself, would love to interview you, on the record or off...<br />

					Thanks, the insight imparted here is consistent with some other versions of this I&#039;ve heard, especially with regards to the columnist. I loved Diaz&#039;s comment about the FBI. Talk about throwing stones... LOL. I hope someone is writing this up since the automatic script machine at Law &amp; Order just burned out. <br /><br /><br />
