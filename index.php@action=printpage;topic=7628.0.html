				I know this might have been discussed before but prostitution on Roosevelt is getting to be a real problem.&nbsp; Every morning it seems to be getting worse as I see more and more of these women walking along the avenue with no care in the world.&nbsp; If anyone knows a number I can call or someone I can write to address this problem I would really appreciate it. <br />I take the q33 home after work around midnight and there&#039;s tons of cops everywhere but then when I go jogging in the morning and run through baxter ave toward 37th ave they&#039;re all I see now.&nbsp; This is getting RIDICULOUS!&nbsp; &nbsp;:tickedoff:

				Call Detective Johnson. who is the Community Affairs Officer at the 115th Precinct. If you Google 115th Precinct and look for Community Affairs under the list of contacts, her number will be there.<br /><br />She is not always easy to reach her on the phone right way but, if you leave her a message describing the problem, with your name and phone number, she is very responsive and she <strong>will </strong>get back to you.

				Yeah, pretty juvenile comment, JaxsonHitesDelux.<br /><br />But thank you for introducing me to the guy who took this picture, Chris Amade. His Flickr page includes some striking street photography from Jackson Heights, Hunts Point and East New York. The series he did on prostitutes in Jackson Heights was actually very sensitive and respectful.

				You liberals are so hyper-sensitive.&nbsp; As a homosensualist myself, I have a license to use/abuse archaic terminology such as &quot;the third sex&quot; to highlight the Eisenhower-era panic of posters wanting the gestapo to stomp out prostitution.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that the point of this thread?&nbsp; And as far as demeaning transpersons, I think the guy/gal hanging out his/her/its tidbits on the street like that (as seen in the photo) is demeaning him/her/itself just fine even without my camp humor.&nbsp; Donchathink?&nbsp; <br /><br />p.s.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget to vote for Romney so we can help stomp out prostitution.<br /><br />p.s.s.<br /><br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/arnade/7894222260/

				A few months ago, I read an eye-opening, in depth article about Human(sex) Trafficking on BBC news online, I was disturbed to read that that a large number of young women forced/sold in to prostitution, coming from Central Amer/ Mexico, end up, guess where? our neighborhood, Jackson Heights, as well as a few other nearby Queens neighborhoods. Just google, sex trafficking new york jackson heights, to read some of the sad facts....<br />There was also an article in the Queens Chronicle from earlier this year you can google: &#039;Fighting the sex trade in Queens and statewide&#039;<br />It&#039;s disturbing, but I think it is important to get the facts....<br /><br />Take Care<br /><br />
