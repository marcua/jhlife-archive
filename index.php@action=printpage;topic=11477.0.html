				Strange question:<br /><br />Anyone know of a place in the neighborhood where I could get a wedding ring stretched or enlarged or something like that? Any idea of an approximate cost? <br /><br />Alternately, I could lose 15-20 lbs, but where&#039;s the fun in that?&nbsp; :-X

				maybe one of the bigger South Asian jewelry stores on 74th? some seem to have actual jewelers who create pieces on site, so they should be able to do a resizing, i would think.

				That&#039;s what I figured, I was just wondering if anyone had any good (or bad) experience with a particular one.

				Devison&#039;s on 82nd near between Roosevelt and 37th did an excellent job resizing a ring for me.&nbsp; The are on the east side of the street (closer to Roosevelt).

				There&#039;s a jeweler across from Table Wine (I think it&#039;s called Alisa and Sofia&#039;s Jewelry) where I had some necklaces fixed and my engagement ring cleaned. Their prices were reasonable and they were very nice. I think they could do it.

				Thanks, everyone. <br /><br />Homeowner, if I may - when you say &quot;resizing&quot; did they stretch the ring out, or did they cut it and add material to it?

				Not in the neighborhood, but if you&#039;d make the trip to lower Manhattan, Greenwich Jewelers on Trinity Place does a wonderful job with resizing. I found that when I was looking for a place that does resizing about 5 years ago, most places sent the ring off site, and needed to hang onto it for about a week to complete the service. Greenwich does everything on site, and if you make an appointment, it takes them no more than an hour. It&#039;s also a small family operation - dad and business partner are the jewelers that do the work in the back, and his two adult daughters handle sales in front. Lovely people.

				Thank you! <br /><br />I dropped it off at Devison&#039;s today. I pick it up Monday. I&#039;ll let you know. <br />

				And I&#039;m thrilled to end this exciting tale by saying that Devison&#039;s did a great job. Ring fits great, and they polished it at no extra charge. Price was exactly what they quoted. Big thumbs up from me.

				Sorry for not responding Superclam I had not checked the site in a few days.&nbsp; So glad they did a good job for you.&nbsp; To answer your question, they made my ring larger.&nbsp; I have no idea how they did it as it was invisible to me.

				Haha, I am also clueless as to how this happened. I&#039;m guessing some sort of heat &amp; stretching was involved. Anyway, thanks for the recommendation. <br />
