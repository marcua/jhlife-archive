					The way I understand the law - if someone is completely physically in your place and threatens you, you can do what you need to defend yourself and home. In my case since he wasn&#039;t completely in if I had somehow harmed him I could be liable. Yes, that is what we are up against.The nebulous part is what do they call a threat? And it would be their word against mine.Weapon or no weapon shown to me their presence is a threat. They didn&#039;t just climb through the window for a cup of tea.<br /><br /><br /><br />

					<br />Thanks Bella &amp; Captain. <br /><br />Yes I saw his face clearly. The police are sorting through the story and the cams. One step at a time.<br />I agree a baseball bat is legal. In an ideal world it&#039;s not a weapon. I&#039;d rather take it to Travers and play with the kids. But if it means peace of mind at home then so be it.

					Thanks dssjh! The cops pointed out the cams to me and said there are cams across the street also. Really it&#039;s not the sort of thing I pay attention to. And there is a good reason for that - I&#039;m not into mischief! Just a normal low key person here. So they see me coming and going? Who cares, I have nothing to hide. Now that I see the cams my sense of humor says look up at them and wave hi.<br /><br />I hope that it makes you feel comfortable as well to know that the cams are there.<br /><br />Thanks also ljr.<br /><br />I also want to say that I do not support defunding the police, and held that view before my incident. If there are problematic cops the system needs to be able to identify them and handle that on an individual basis. We need to have them and having less instead of more is not going to help anything at all. <br /><br /><br />

					Thank you r, abcdefghijk, Ms. Jackson for your support and help. I am happy to see that this thread has a lot of views. I have been living in this apartment for 28 years, been in the neighborhood since I am 5. I love JH and that is why I am here in it and on this site. The more we can share, even if we disagree at times, the better off we all are. The police are involved. I did see the creeps face and there are cams everywhere over here.

					Other than being rattled by this experience I am fine. Who knows what would have happened if he had come all the way in. Yes he went up and disappeared and that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean to another window. I am now better prepared in a legal way. So I wouldn&#039;t recommend that he or any of his friends try it again.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Last night at 11:45 PM I was sitting in front of my computer. Directly behind me on the opposite side of the room is a window to the fire escape. The window does have a fire safety gate on it, but I had it open and a small fan in the window. I heard a crash and thought the fan fell over. When I turned around the fan was lying down, the screen that was down was now up and I saw a a pair of man&#039;s arms on the fan. He was about to move it out of the way and come in! <br /><br />I did scare him with a LOUD set of expletives. Now the guy was apologizing and trying to hand me a story about not being able to get into his apartment. I did see him and he was no one that I know. And he certainly knew this isn&#039;t his apartment. The guy ran up above and disappeared.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, if he&#039;s desperate from Covid economics or if he has an expensive daily habit to support. Both of which are maybe an incentive for burglary. I should also say that the window is quite visible to the outside and in a fairly well lit up place. This may be an isolated incidence or the beginning of a neighborhood rash. Please be vigilant as well as careful!

					Summer camp needs are not the same as permanent shut down of the Avenue.<br />Depending on the needs of the Summer camp Travers has space including 78th already permanently shut. If that isn&#039;t sufficient then there is an opening for dialogue. But traffic still needs to flow, cars need parking spaces and deliveries need to be made. That is not mean spirited, it&#039;s logical and practical.

JH isn&#039;t Disney nor should it become that. If young families don&#039;t feel this place is kid friendly enough why are they here? They knew, or should have known what neighborhood they moved into.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Maybe Jackson Heights didn&#039;t used to have a big kid population decades and decades ago. <br /><br />It certainly does now. And in a democracy, numbers matter... <br /><br />Young families have changed the neighborhood. <br /><br />It&#039;s no longer ok to not be kid friendly. As perhaps in a previous era.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Perhaps you misunderstood or came to a hasty conclusion. Did I touch on a sensitive nerve?<br />I am in no way opposed to children or people having them. In fact that was never the case in JH at all. I did try to point out however that children do not rule this neighborhood. And yes to be truly democratic as you say means to consider that there are other needs here besides children only!<br /><br />If you know the the history of JH you would acknowledge that the original marketing strategy to bringing people here was geared at Manhattan families. JH was said to be a planned community with trees, open air and recreation space where children could get out of the stifling city. A place where people could raise families, in a more gentle environment. That also meant having our commercial zone as well as our less trafficked quiet zone. <br /><br />The ends of the side streets were open gardens, not built upon. On 34th and &amp; 35th Avenues there were grassy malls with benches running up the middle. The golf course was also here then providing plenty of open space for all and included a colonial era farm house that was called &quot;The Casino&quot; which served as a meeting place and club house. Travers Park is the last remaining vestige of the golf course that was never built on. There were also the private gardens behind groups of buildings which still exist today. The boards that govern those private gardens have strict rules these days that barely allow for anything but looking. The problem was the housing shortage after WW2 and the end blocks, malls, and gold course all began to disappear. As a side note, even today the children&#039;s playground within Travers is placed at the Northern Blvd. end of the park, not right on 34th Ave. Is this also to be considered non kid friendly? <br /><br />We also had our own small hospital in which many of JH&#039;s second generation were born. More Kids! And it really is too bad that the place couldn&#039;t have had its problems resolved and remained a hospital. it might have been an asset during this pandemic. Too many Queens hospitals were shut down and we were left at the mercy of the overburdened Elmhurst General. And what happened to our hospital and it&#039;s generous sized parking lot? A public school.... but we don&#039;t like kids here?<br /><br />I said this neighborhood is not Disney nor should it be. It is also not a Club Med for singles or a Billyburgh for Hipsters. It is a wonderful well planned place with all kinds of people with all kinds of needs ALL of which need to be considered. THAT is the democratic way. Add to this our original planned &quot;Garden Within the City&quot; has been compromised over the years and there is only so much that can be done at this point for ALL who live here. <br />
