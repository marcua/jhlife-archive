				Sign went up for a pharmacy in between Sagar Chinese and the upcoming Italian restaurant. Name sounds familiar--is it moving from another location on 37th maybe? Unbelievable how many pharmacies we have --also optical stores and banks, of course. How do they all survive?

				Agree DSSJH--lack of business expertise and maybe lousy luck is probably the real problem. The owners of Jackson Gyro are experienced restaurant owners. Same with Sagar Chinese. The Queensboro guy is not an experienced restaurant owner, and though Stew is a chef, not a restaurant owner either. <br /><br />I will never understand this thing about the neighborhood only supporting cheap food options. There are a number of long-term, successful restaurants here that are not at all cheap--Peruvian, Argentinian, Columbian, etc, as well as Uncle Peter&#039;s, off the top of my head. My husband and I went for dinner on Valentine&#039;s Day to Armandos--granted it was a big holiday, but it was jammed to the rafters with a line out the door, and with people from all backgrounds and ethnic groups, not just what used to be called &quot;yuppies&quot; back in the day. Yes, it was a special occasion--but the other restaurants I listed above seem to do just fine in Jackson Heights.

				I was told the owners of Jackson Gyro also own the building. So in addition to being experienced business owners, they also didn&#039;t have the same kind of real estate cost pressure.

				Jeffsayes: Swim Two Birds is in a pre-existing restaurant space. There were two previous restaurants there in the six years I&#039;ve been living nearby. The Queensboro was a carpet store.

				ljr is correct about Swim Two Birds.&nbsp; <br /><br />There were at least a couple of Indian restaurants in that spot in the past.<br /><br />The Halal place next door (the one that&#039;s apparently for sale now), however, was originally a dry cleaners.&nbsp; They opened up pretty quickly, if I recall.

				I&#039;m thinking.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s the fact that the Halal place has no liquor license... that situation facilitates the opening of restaurants.<br /><br />Swim and Queensboro both have new liquor licenses, right?<br /><br />So my deduction is that new liquor licensed places are tough to open up.&nbsp;

				If there&#039;s a delay in a liquor license for some reason, how would that stop a restaurant from opening entirely? I&#039;ve gone to plenty of BYOB restaurants as well as places that opened their doors with staff telling us booze would be available in the future once the license came through.

				agreed, Captain.<br /><br />and here come the posts about how allowing BYOB will get a restaurant shut down immediately because it&#039;s illegal -- despite the fact that restaurants all over the city have been advertising (in print and on television) their BYOB status for decades.<br /><br />

				even if BYOB is illegal in NYC, I don&#039;t see how that stops a restaurant from opening up even if it takes longer to get a liquor license. I know selling wine, beer, and cocktails is a money maker for a restaurant, but it&#039;s not a requirement to open. You&#039;ll make more money selling food without booze than selling nothing at all. I don&#039;t think the liquor license is the issue for these restaurants that are taking a lifetime to open.
