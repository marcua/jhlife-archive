					Thank you for bringing up parking ShinjukuBaby, I&#039;m not sure how I forgot to mention that. <br />The city could also do much better in enforcing double parking and other violations. <br />Over a year ago the city implemented the open corridor program on Roosevelt Ave. During the program, the amount of traffic agents aggressively moving along anyone who even attempted to stop along the curb at Roosevelt Ave was something I had never seen before, and was a bit of overkill as the Ave was completely wide open with very little traffic. The minute the program ended, the enforcement just disappeared and Roosevelt turned back into a clogged double parking shit show. Instead of simply targeting that enforcement at double parkers that cause the problem, the city just let everything go back to the way it was. <br /><br />The point is that parking would not even need to be totally eliminated to make 35th Ave flow smoother. Dedicated delivery loading zones on each block coupled with aggressive enforcement of double parking would make a world of difference. That wouldn&#039;t necessarily solve our problem of too many people driving through our neighborhood, but it would be a reasonable compromise.

					I don&#039;t see anyone addressing the real problem- that there is simply too much motor vehicle traffic in and through our community.<br />Why should a great neighborhood amenity be compromised to accommodate people (many not JH residents) driving to and through our community?<br />Sure, plenty of people in the neighborhood own vehicles and use them to commute or to make longer trips, but how many people in the neighborhood drive to go less than a mile within the neighborhood, and in such a dense neighborhood is that type of travel really practical or efficient?<br />Sure the closure of 34th Ave affects the levels of traffic on other local streets, but there must be other options than going back to the status quo of making 34th Ave another alternative car sewer to Northern Blvd. The residents of our community young, old, and everything in between deserve better. 35th Ave should not remain the alternative car sewer to Northern Blvd either. <br /><br />One possibility, which would be difficult in the short term but beneficial in the long term would be to for the DOT to redesign the streets to discourage driving in JH. Restricting through traffic on 35th Ave (with exceptions for buses and school buses), coupled with sufficient signage and enforcement to discourage through traffic&nbsp; on our community streets would be difficult to achieve, but not impossible. Yes it would be much easier to go back to what we had before, but it would be a short term solution to a long term problem. In a few years, the whole neighborhood will be as congested as it is now with 34th open (because it is currently open, not closed) and our quality of life will still suffer. Our community deserves better. <br />If we make driving easier, more people will continue to drive here, if we make it more difficult to drive here, less people will choose to do so. <br /><br />

					Haven&#039;t slept through the night in at least a year? A year ago there was almost no truck traffic and very little traffic of any kind. It was probably the quietest this neighborhood has ever been since it was developed. <br />Our residential side streets happen to be in a densely populated neighborhood with more than one thriving commercial corridor, and is a destination for many, particularly for our restaurants and food trucks. <br />

					Without ever having owned a scooter myself, I&#039;m pretty sure the pros are that it&#039;s super easy to park, and you can just scoot past the block long line of traffic waiting to cross the light at Northern Blvd or 37th or Roosevelt Ave, or pretty much any other traffic. <br />The cons are that people parking cars will probably damage it and knock it over from time to time before it gets stolen, and I think it&#039;s pretty easy to steal a scooter. Two guys can literally pick it up and put in the back of a pickup or van in 30 seconds and be gone. <br />Come to think of it, I don&#039;t think I ever see any scooters parked around here, the theft issue is probably the reason.

					People complain that folks won&#039;t be able to get deliveries, they also complain that there&#039;s delivery vehicles everywhere. <br />They complain about speeding bicycles, but would rather go back to the status quo of speeding cars, trucks, and SUV&#039;s so that more people can drive through our neighborhood. <br />There&#039;s dog crap everywhere! Can&#039;t they please go back to only crapping and peeing on the sidewalk like before?<br />They want to bring up the congestion on 82nd St and 74th St business streets which have always been a traffic nightmare and somehow blame it on 34th Ave. <br /><br />This open 34th ave is obviously not working out. Nobody goes there- it&#039;s too crowded.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/tongue.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" />

					Read the article. The headline is misleading.<br />It&#039;s not permanent, but the program has been extended indefinitely past the original Oct 31st end date.

I get that people like to take a stroll but the median on 34th is not a park.&nbsp; The needs of the people who don&#039;t have cars doesn&#039;t out weigh the needs of the&nbsp; people&nbsp; who need them for work and family. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>People can still own, drive, and park cars in the neighborhood. The 34th Ave open street does not prevent that. Sure it makes driving more inconvenient at times, but it does not preclude driving in the neighborhood. <br />Opening 34th back up to traffic will completely take away the one significant open space in the neighborhood that people can walk, ride, and play on. It sounds like you want to completely take away something that adds great benefit to MANY in the community because it causes a minor inconvenience to some residents (and many non residents). It&#039;s basically &quot;all for me, none for you&quot;. The selfishness exhibited in that position is amazing. <br />&nbsp;

I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve probably buzzed people in who were not delivering any packages to me -- I just have to hope the people I&#039;ve buzzed in were legit delivery people and their delivery was for someone else in my building.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If someone says it&#039;s UPS (or Amazon or whatever), ask who it&#039;s for.
