				good evening growing up in Astoria all my life a 3 family home was called a &quot;<span class="bbc_u">Three Family Home</span>&quot; and not a &quot;Townhouse&quot;.&nbsp; If you look in all of the real estate books it doesn&#039;t say &quot;townhouse&quot; for a Three Family Home.&nbsp; I guess people are really trying to be fancy in Astoria now.&nbsp; :)
