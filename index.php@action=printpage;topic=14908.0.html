				Has anyone taken the bus down to the Rockaways? I usually drive to Jacob Riis beach but looking to go to near 116th St and don&#039;t want to deal with parking. How long does the bus usually take on a weekend? Is getting home a nightmare?

				It takes about an hour and a half or so by bus and like 30 min to drive. We like to catch it at the first stop in woodside to guarantee a seat because it gets packed in the summer.&nbsp; There is a municipal lot on 116 if you get there early enough you can find a spot. Coming back the stop is the same as the drop off.&nbsp; There always seems to be a bus waiting there and the traffic is not so bad. There is a stop by Elmhurst hospital and the 74th street station.

				We usually take Q52 or Q53 at Queens mall to Rockaway during weekend. As there is almost no traffic and only limited bus stops. This bus line can easily be the fastest bus and probably reach the same speed as a subway. Q52/Q53 from Queens mall to Rockaway is about 40-50 minutes.<br /><br />When we come back, we only take Q53 as the kids are tired and it&#039;s hard to do subway transfer. It can be 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes from Rockaway to 74th st, depending on the heavy traffic at the Broadway section<br />

				The bus is great, I took it this weekend at 74th Street to 116th last stop, at 10am Sat - it takes an hour both ways, coming back round 6pm.&nbsp; Most of the young people get out at 96th but you can ride it further and get away from the crazy crowds.&nbsp; I highly recommend the bus and getting on at Woodside or 74 guarantees you a seat, also getting on at 116 gets you a seat.&nbsp; Otherwise it&#039;s packed with people going fishing and swimming or commuting.

				This is great to know, thanks! I think I&#039;ll try out this option sometime this summer. Glad that you are able to get a seat if you get on at 116th!
