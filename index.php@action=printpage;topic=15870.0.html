				It seems that the Surenos and Mara 18 have gotten into a pretty serious tag war in between 35th and Roosevelt from 86th to 91st over the past 3-4 months (especially around Roosevelt. They&#039;ve really hit the Vanilla Cafe). I&#039;ve called 311, the 115th, and sent an email to the Jackson Heights Beautification Group about getting it removed. Result: Nothing. Any ideas of how to get this taken care of or am I going to have to paint over it myself?

				JHBG&#039;s graffiti-removal team, like all of our endeavors, is volunteer and does not work in the winter because graffiti removal involves spraying lots of water under high pressure to remove chemical solvents - something that winter weather is not conducive to doing. <br />The city has a program to remove graffiti, but I&#039;m not sure of the extent of its work. May want to check with Councilman Dromm of Ferreras offices. Good luck.<br /><br />

				Have you tried taking a photo on it on twitter and tweeting at nypd115? in the day and age of social media, this probably has more impact

				I am told that Roosevelt has it&#039;s own task force of NYPD 115 and NYPD 110. I don&#039;t know how to get in touch with them. Senator Peralta has a campaign to clean up Roosevelt, and always responds on Facebook. Maybe try that? <br />Also, I recently met the 115 crime prevention officers, they were doing outreach at Planet Fitness, almost the same block at Vanilla Cafe. Maybe give them a call? Here are all the NYPD numbers for the 115. I&#039;ll help paint, if you do decide to. I noticed it, and it&#039;s on my kids walk to school. I wish it wasn&#039;t, so I&#039;d help. <br />Precinct: (718) 533-2003<br />Community Affairs: (718) 533-2010<br />Community Policing: (718) 533-2035<br />Crime Prevention: (718) 533-2052<br />Domestic Violence: (718) 533-2070<br />Youth Officer: (718) 533-2071<br />Auxiliary Coordinator: (718) 533-2071<br />Detective Squad: (718) 533-2039&nbsp; <br />
