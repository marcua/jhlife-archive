				Apparently when Don Francisco Meat Market closed, they did not take their cat.&nbsp; I approached Dr. Tselos&#039; office to see if they had any information.&nbsp; I just learned this morning, his office was unable to contact the owners and have called the ASPCA to come and rescue the animal.&nbsp; The person I talked to at Tselos&#039; office said a number of people have come in concerned about the cat&#039;s welfare.&nbsp; If anyone knows a store that might want a mouser...<br /><br />

				I checked the store again this morning and the cat is still there, although someone must have been in the store as the filled black garbage bags are gone. Since the sign in Don Francisco&#039;s said go to Chivito D&#039;Oro for sausages, I went over to Chivito D&#039;Oro and inquired about the cat.&nbsp; They seem to know the owners, so left my number and hopefully they will be able to find out something.&nbsp;

				I saw the kitty there as the store was closing and thinking oh&#039; they will come back for it. &nbsp;If they have cleared everything out and left the cat there then that is animal abuse / neglect / cruelty to an animal and the officials should be called on the owners. &nbsp;People that abuse animals are more prone to abuse children and other people. &nbsp;I used to go to Don Francisco and thought that they were all very nice people. &nbsp;If this is true, it it very very sad and upsetting and people should know about it.&nbsp;Thank you concerned neighbors! &nbsp;You are what makes our neighborhood great.

				I agree with Griswold Girl.&nbsp; <br /><br />Somehow I doubt someone from the closed down shop has been stopping in to feed/water the poor kitty.&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(<br /><br />I am also surprised the ASPCA has not come to rescue it yet.

				if you call the ASPCA, they will not keep her, they transfer their dogs and cats to the ACC in Manhattan which is a kill shelter..so if someone can take her, it will save her life.

				I went by Don Francisco&#039;s just now and there was not one but TWO very serene-looking cats sitting there waiting - possibly siblings.&nbsp; The are both basically white cats with patches of color.&nbsp; One has two other colors, making her definitely a girl and the other is white with orange patches, which means it could be either a girl or a boy.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see any sign of food or water dishes but they may be in the back.&nbsp;

				On an impulse, I looked up the phone number for Don Francisco and called it.&nbsp; A man answered but said he was not the owner - just someone cleaning the store.&nbsp; I have a feeling he really WAS the owner but did not want to admit it.&nbsp; He was very defensive and&nbsp; said that the owner comes every day to feed the cats and that people should not worry.&nbsp; I guess we should keep an eye on this and see if that&#039;s really the case.&nbsp; I asked him if the owner was going to eventually take the cats out of there and he said he did not know.&nbsp; Please, everyone - when you go by, keep an eye out and see if there are any apparent changes to the picture.
