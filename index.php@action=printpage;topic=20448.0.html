Like I don&#039;t know... some freak show shooting into an apartment building, or the the increase assaults, or any number of other things that have a much greater impact on the quality of life in Jackson Heights.

				I think it&#039;s a great idea to have a thread about vendors on 34th Ave.. I don&#039;t live on 34th Ave, but I have heard from some residents that they are concerned about the additional trash issues, and also noise/smells, especially if the cart or vehicle for vending is set up directly outside of people&#039;s apartment windows.<br /><br />Would love to hear from other residents of 34th Ave or the surrounding blocks to hear their opinions.

				I am concerned about vendors for several reasons:<br /><br />1. Health concerns - quality of food, cleaniness of the cooking, etc. Basically keeping up with the NYC guidelines for healthy food services - esp. disease issues.<br /><br />2. Garbage left in the area.<br /><br />3. Increase in vermin from the garbage and food. <br /><br />4. The unfair competition for our local merchants who have suffered for over 1 year because of the COVID close down. Support our merchants.<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;The advocates for Open Streets permanent closure while in a pandemic without serious urban planning studies are going to get more than they wished for. The potential for Carnivale with any of the necessary supports is high. The vendors, the trash, the ebikes, the 12hr every day closures! and other aspects need a real examination over a period of time to insure that things are done with a good outcome for all of our residents. We can find lessons from the High Line where people who live next door to it are the least happy. Let&#039;s not make issues where we can avoid it. Compromises could be had!<br /><br />&nbsp;BTW, 37th Ave and Northern Blvd both have some truly excellent restaurants, delis and cafes that could really use more business right now.

				There&#039;s a lot of great ideas here, and I&#039;m glad that this has turned into a productive conversation. Ultimately, while I do enjoy taking a stroll down 34th, and feel that is a great benefit to the community since there is so little public space, I&#039;m ambivalent about allowing vendors. There are times when I&#039;m walking there and think to myself &quot;man I&#039;d really like an empanada&quot; but then I remember, as one person mentioned, that there are several excellent places on Northern or 37th where I could find one. In other words, the lack of vendors will not keep me from taking a brisk evening walk.<br /><br />Anyhoo, how do you all feel about the stack of drunks on 82nd Street, the increase in assaults, and the freak shows that like to shoot into windows?

Not to mention the noise level and vendors issues. Sorry but High Line type development is not a sell for locals, luxury apts though might be in favor.

				Comparing apples with oranges is no help at all.<br /><br />There is no way luxury apartment developments built by esteemed architects will be constructed in Jackson Heights/Corona along 34th Ave.<br /><br />Just like urban living cannot be compared with suburban living.<br /><br />A person might as well compare 34th Ave to the Champs Elysees in Paris. <br />These comparisons are attempting to prove a point with no logic behind them.<br /><br />34th Ave is nothing like the High Line in upmarket Chelsea. <br /><br />Nor should it be.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&quot;locals being forced off sidewalks by throngs of High Line visitors&quot; - I do sympathize, but some of those sidewalks hardly accommodate one person. And 74th Street between Roosevelt and 37th can get very congested with large family clusters at times!

				&nbsp;That luxury building on Roosevelt and 70th streets seems to be doing just fine. It looks pretty well occupied and having that great restaurant row across the street with UFC and the Isakawa has got to be a selling point. They have a great deal on daytime parking too. Looks like 6 apts are available on Streeteasy. So no, we are not the same market as the High Line by a long stretch but there are new luxury buildings in the lower 70&#039;s and sadly this might mean the loss of our South Asian community which does not seem to have a voice here in the neighborhood with the horrendous traffic and filthy streets that never change.<br />&nbsp; One other thing that I believe is important. The Highline was built slowly. In manageable pieces. And they are still adding to it. The 34th Ave project feels too big to do well in one shot. Many people feel this way but the political voices are not saying so just yet. Take it slow and do it well please!

				Jackson Heights in Queens is nothing like the fancy parts of Manhattan/Brooklyn.<br /><br />Like I said before, you might as well compare Jackson Heights to Paris, it&#039;s equally absurd. <br /><br />34th Ave is working fine...and the majority of folks are happy with it.<br /><br />That&#039;s what matters.

				&nbsp;There ARE places in which the green spaces could expand. But what is most concerning is the aspect of the now vs. what the needs might be in 3-5 years. Will walking down 34th ave always be as interesting to residents when the pandemic is behind us? Should we stage in real improvements slowly and see the response? Or do we just go all out, right now, and ask for everything to be permanent for the foreseeable future?<br /><br />&nbsp; If I was a person very invested in the Open Streets program, I would want to know what every objection was so that I could deal with it before proceeding. The fact that certain constituent&#039;s issues are being totally ignored is concerning. The area around 77th/78th/79th needs real attention. The people who need rides are in desperate straights here. The traffic around the park is clogged now and gets awful every summer. Who knows what this summer will bring? The top of 34th at Junction is a major traffic issue with the supermarket exits and the bottom at 69th street needs to be reconsidered<br />with lack of walkers and businesses impacted negatively. These are just a few of the issues that need solutions in the short/long term. <br /><br />&nbsp; Yes, there is green space and play space to be found here in JH Lot&#039;s of areas in public schools could be opened to the community and insides and rooftops could provide much extra space. It seems like closing areas like 90th/91st Street where there has been significant crime over the years would benefit from closures. But the way the discussion has gone so far saying &quot;Don&#039;t Change Anything!&quot; and leave 34th Ave closed 12hrs a day, 7 days a week and count on volunteers at all times to move barriers and clean and garden is just not making sense to me long term - or frankly, now.

				&nbsp;Responding to the above post:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>1) how do you deal with security around schools? most parents might raise concerns about making schoolyards and school rooftops open to everyone. </strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp; Have you ever been around IS145 after school hours? There are many groups using this space.The yard is very popular and the cafe style tables added in recent years are wonderful. I think that the yard in front of PS69 could be used by the community with some but not lots of supervision for example. The school up at 90th? has popular dance classes and other offerings already. These spaces can be rented though I am not sure exactly the method- might go through the janitors?. There is great space in IS230 that is sometimes rented by religious groups on the weekends. The newest JH school at 70th and 34th ave. looks to have rooftop space but am not sure if anyone uses it yet. Since the open play fields wer<em>e taken over by the fenced off green mound in Traver Pk. free play spaces are not so available here. These are just a few random places that I know about and until we FINALLY get a community center, this might work.</em></em><br /><br />2) <strong>how do you deal with insurance for people randomly climbing onto rooftops? and how do you transform those rooftops from asphalt to &quot;green space.&quot;</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The same insurance that the above groups pay to the city could be used by the community. I am not sure that everyone is looking for &quot;green space&quot; but rather &quot;play space&quot; or just free space. I remember that for years an older woman would play basketball by herself in the morning at Travers Park and a guy with big headphones and rollerblades would be zooming around. There was a thriving dog walking group in the AM and PM before the renovations. No, its wasn&#039;t green but was what they used well apparently. Green is also high maintenance and very costly as lawns are considered poor choices in urban areas. Native plants and shrubs are better bang for buck.</em><br /><br />3) <strong>how would closing a crime ridden street to traffic cut down on crime when most of that crime is committed on foot?</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>I know that this is true but it also seems like more eyes might be on the street and if accomplices were part of it, they couldn&#039;t make a quick getaway with closed streets. Also am thinking that shorter blocks can ban adult use of bicycles which is another deterrent. Have older bikers dismount for that block for safety. Could have a crossing guard or traffic cop here which is a job that many people would be qualified for. Hire locals.</em>

				thank you for a serious, well-considered reply. you make some excellent points, and some that i disagree with. need to digest and not toss off an off the cuff response.
