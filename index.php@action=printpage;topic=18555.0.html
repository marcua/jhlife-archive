				Hi everyone! This will be my first Christmas living in a co-op and we are encouraged to tip the Super and maintenance workers for Christmas. <br /><br />What is the usual amount that we are supposed to tip ? Does the super get a bigger tip than the other workers?<br /><br />Any guidance would be appreciated it.

				tipping is a must, in my view. i usually give the super 75-100 dollars in a card, and the porter, our only other building employee, 20-25. they&#039;re both great guys who work very hard, and it&#039;s not a quid pro quo, but i always figure it doesn&#039;t hurt to have some goodwill built up.

				Think of tipping as insurance for good service next year.<br /><br />$75 for the super seems reasonable but if you call on him regularly then maybe more. The super is essential to tip. When you have a flood in your apartment, or no heat, or some other issue and you have to call him at 1 a.m., you want him to remember that you were the very nice person who generously tipped. He will likely respond in a much more timely manner. Cynical, yes, but true.<br /><br />Maybe $50 if you have a doorman.<br /><br />

				I would note though that if your super is full-time, and housing is provided in the coop, that&#039;s kind of a different situation than the porters and other maintenance staff. My coop has a decent number of maintenance staff and a full time super on salary who gets housing included as part of the compensation package. That definitely effects the decision making process on who gets how much or if the super gets a tip.

				If there&#039;s a big staff the other rule of thumb would be to only give to those you really know and have interacted with or those who have assisted you in some particular way.<br /><br />Most supers live rent free and get a salary. You still ought to tip them before anyobne as they&#039;re your go-to when problems arise.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve heard folks say: `I called my super five times about this issue and I can&#039;t get him to come.&#039; Next question I ask: `Did you tip him at Christmas and do you ever tip him when he stops by to do something?&#039; The answer is usually no.<br /><br />I know that sounds harsh but the reality is the super is a service employee and no one gets rich doing the job. It&#039;s often dirty and thankless and not that all well paying. You&#039;re expected to be on call 24/7 and deal with all manner of people.<br /><br />Giving the guy $75 or whatever is reasonable.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi All <br /><br />Thank you for all the feedback. Very appreciated! I plan to tip because the building is well maintained and I def want to remain on their good side. <br /><br />I live in a co-op with several buildings so we have a dedicated porter for each building so I would probably give to the super and to the porter in my building. <br />&nbsp;<br />:)

				I&#039;m going to increase my tips this year because of all of the extra work they have been doing lately due to everyone ordering things online. We get so many more packages than we used to.

				If I had a full-time super who got housing as part of his compensation package ignore my phone calls, that&#039;s something I&#039;d make sure the board who hired him address since the super is failing to performing the job he was hired to do. Tipping the maintenance staff, sure. (But I also, and I think more importantly, tip them throughout the year when they help me out with something) But tipping the super to ensure he performs his job that includes a salary and zero housing cost? Nah.&nbsp;

				I tip the super! He doesn&#039;t just sit around delegating work- he is always outside shoveling in the winter, he&#039;s the one people text in the middle of the night, he is the one who comes to my apartment when something goes wrong and he is much of the reason our building runs smoothly and is so clean. He helps me way more than the porters and doormen (but i tip them too!). I am so grateful to him and i make sure to show it by tipping him well at xmas and throughout the year when he does me a favor.<br /><br />

In the city, it can account for 40-60% of where your money goes (if not more). A full-time super who gets a salary, full-time benefits, and housing costs covered has a decent compensation package. I consider the compensation package that I am paying for as shareholder and take in to account whether or not someone is management and earning a salary versus earning an hourly wage. Now, if the super is part-time, doesn&#039;t have housing included, etc. that&#039;s a different situation.

				Tipping is like giving a year end bonus at any other place of employ. Many places do and some places don&#039;t. I know it makes a difference to me even if I already have a &quot;good comp package.&quot; I don&#039;t see how it would be different for staff at a co-op. I think the staff at our co-op do a great job. It cost us ~$350 to tip everyone at the end of the year which I feel like wasn&#039;t a burden for us but a nice gesture/token of appreciation. If it&#039;s not possible for you financially, I think that&#039;s one thing but otherwise, why not?

So it&#039;s rather like comparing apples to oranges since coops aren&#039;t profit making businesses.<br /><br />Basically, I and others draw a line between tipping management and tipping non-management. I tip my server at a restaurant, but I don&#039;t tip the manager; I tip my hairdresser, but if the owner of the hair salon is doing my hair, I don&#039;t tip him/her. I get it if folks want to tip their full-time building super (or do so with a gift of a nice bottle of wine) out of appreciation for hard work and excellence, but I don&#039;t get it as a shareholder if the intent of the tip to the super is to ensure the super actually performs the job the individual is hired and paid fairly to do. If the only way to get your super to return your phone call is to give a holiday tip, the super is derelict in his/her basic job description.

				1. I tip my super and the other staff (porters, etc.). If I didn&#039;t, I believe that I would still get called back if I report that something&#039;s not working properly. But I think sometimes people who tip might get quicker service. I mean, if two apartments have reported a similarly urgent problem, and one has tipped and the other hasn&#039;t, someone has to be helped first.<br /><br />2. Not all issues are similarly urgent. I may be wrong, but I tend to think that being a tipper helps get results for something that&#039;s not in any way urgent.<br /><br />3. The fact is, apartment building residents <em>do</em> tip. Who wants to be known as one of the apartments that doesn&#039;t tip?
