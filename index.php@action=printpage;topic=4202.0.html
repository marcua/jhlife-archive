				Been passing it a number of times and decided to try it last night. &nbsp;Cassidy&#039;s Ale House on 75th &amp; 31st Ave opposite the shopping plaza with Canelle!!!!!! &nbsp;:D is exactly what you would expect. An Irish style pub, tap beers and pub food. &nbsp;I finally found a hamburger that is drip down your chin good. :rockon: &nbsp;The place was packed and a bit noisy with partyers (sp!) and the requisite TV&#039;s tuned into every sport channel and alas one FOX channel, but I won&#039;t hold that against them. &nbsp;Burger was delicious, my partner had a grilled chicken sandwich with ham &amp; cheese and Blue Moon on Tap. &nbsp;Just what the nabe needs, now why can&#039;t we get something on 37th Ave like this???? &nbsp;Could greedy landlords charging exorbitant rents have something to do with it????Hmmmmmm :o :o &nbsp;&gt;:( sorry into icons today.

				Agreeing with Jimbo.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also gone for burgers at Cassidy&#039;s Ale House and have enjoyed every morsel!&nbsp; &nbsp;:smitten:&nbsp; I&#039;ve also substituted sweet potato fries for the regular fries.&nbsp; Yum!

				So glad that other people are finally recognizing the wonderfulness of Cassidy&#039;s burgers! I live just a few blocks away and go there at least 2 or 3 times a week for a few drinks and their Cassidy&#039;s special burger with sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon and BBQ sauce is my go-to meal when I have something to eat. Actually everything that I have had on their menu is really good. Their wings are also phenomenal. I like the medium ones best (they have a spicy sweet flavor) but the hot ones are great too. <br />Try the Franziskaner beer on tap, it&#039;s even better than Blue Moon.

				Is Cassidy&#039;s a restaurant/pub similar to Donovan&#039;s, where you could bring the kids at lunchtime? or is it really more of a bar that happens to serve food--ie, best to leave the kids at home?

				I&#039;ve gone to Cassidy&#039;s twice now, and each time there have been families with children (tweens) there.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually a pretty nice environment.
