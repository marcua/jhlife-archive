				Hello everyone I&#039;ve been living in Jackson Heights for almost a year now and haven&#039;t fully explore here much. I&#039;m usually in other parts of Queens or Manhattan. I recently went to a nail salon (will not mention the name) and they did a horrible job on my gel manicure, that I am slightly disappointment by and upset that I spent $20 on a horrible gel manicure. I was wondering if there is any good nail salon around Jackson Heights that you all recommend that do a nice decent job on gel manicure. I am on 76ST &amp; Broadway. Thank You!

				Sorry, but, I gotta make an example of this. Don&#039;t be afraid to walk around and find your spot. There&#039;s no shortage of nail salons around. And a bad manicure is of very little consequence. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get manicures but, when I moved here I left my barber of 15 years because I wanted to go to a local guy. I walked around and selected someone after surveying the scene inside. Now we are pretty friendly when I go in. And that is essentially what makes a neighborhood feel like one. You walk around and get familiar. Spend time <span class="bbc_u">and money</span> in the local businesses. Based on recent comments, it seems like there&#039;s a concern that the friendly and village like quality in JH is at stake as new folks move in. That&#039;s pretty normal for NY today and probably always has been. But, when your new, it&#039;s important to try to integrate into a place rather than bend it to ones tastes and interests. Not trying to pick on you. Just more of general thing in response to other threads I&#039;ve seen on here recently....

				Gordan, xamy was looking for a recommendation not a lecture.&nbsp; Anyway, although I&#039;ve only used the Nail Salon at 35-58 78 Street twice, I was very pleased and plan to use it in the future.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve never had a gel manicure but I like Cindy&#039;s on the corner of 81st and 37th for a quick mani. it&#039;s cash only so come prepared. Also, another friend in the neighborhood recently recommended Mari at Dior Salon on 80th between 37th and Roosevelt. She is very thorough and takes her time doing your nails. My regular (non-gel) manicure stayed flawless for a week after I went to her.

				I don&#039;t get my nails done often, but I got a pedi at the Nail Salon on 78th st and liked them too. <br /><br />Not sure what the problem with asking for recommendations is... one can get a serious infection from a shop that isn&#039;t clean/careful.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16977.msg81121.html#msg81121">Quote from: JH3525 on September 13, 2017, 09:55:26 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Gordan, xamy was looking for a recommendation not a lecture.&nbsp; Anyway, although I&#039;ve only used the Nail Salon at 35-58 78 Street twice, I was very pleased and plan to use it in the future. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />

				&quot;Walking around&quot; and &quot;getting familiar&quot; with a neighborhood does jack all for finding a nail salon and nail tech who does a nice job on gel manicures. The only way to find out where to go is to ask for recommendations, risk having crappy looking nails for two weeks as you try salon after salon, or risk being arrested for loitering as you try to stake out a spot to examine everyone&#039;s gel manicured nails as they leave.<br /><br />That being said, I know someone who recently moved to the neighborhood who does gel manicures. Any recommendations from the board east of 82nd St.?
