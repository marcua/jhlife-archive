					Here is the reason we only accept <br /><br /><strong>electronic checks...can I pay by cash or check?</strong><br />Farm Spot only accepts electronic checks. They are a safe, simple way for members to pay, and an efficient way for us to process the hundreds of applications we receive. In the past, volunteers spent weeks processing these applications manually, resulting in numerous complaints about delays in cashing checks. Electronic checks are a safe and secure alternative, and allow us to quickly receive funds, issue a receipt, and pay the farm in a timely manner. Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:farmspot@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">farmspot@gmail.com</a> with any further questions.
