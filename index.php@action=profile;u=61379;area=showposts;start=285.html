I&#039;M genuinely excited to be part of the Washington Plaza family and part of this amazing neighborhood&#039;s fabric!<br />I&#039;m so glad to hear that I&#039;m not the only one that painfully endured a long process from the date of offer being accepted to actually closing. I bought my 2 bedroom in the D building in May and finally moved in November. It was seriously the longest few months bc I was just looking forward to being in this neighborhood! I&#039;m a Queens gal through and through. Lived in other places and Queens is where I always come back to as HOME. Being in JH has even reaffirmed that notion. <br />I would LOVE a get-together as I&#039;m really looking to build a community within the building and make new friends in the hood. I&#039;m a single mom of a daughter who is by the way looking for babysitting gigs. She&#039;s responsible, so good with kids, smart and very mature. Also loves to sing, a lot and all the time, so we apologize in advance if you hear her. She will be 12 this Sunday! You may see us together like sisters, she&#039;s a super kid!!!<br />I&#039;m so excited to learn that the gym will be in the D building! I can&#039;t wait for this to be finished but I heard that may be the last phase which seemed like another year of constant construction. <br />So far, I&#039;m so happy about the purchase. I love the neighbors I have met this far. The staff here is by far the best group of such hard working, sweet and helpful people. We feel very lucky. <br />As far as the courtyard, I heard that they wanted to restone the fountain edges and just update the gardening. <br />I also thought I&#039;d be super upset about losing FiOs but TWC must have some amazing deals with WP bc my network connection speed is super fast! I don&#039;t own cable so I&#039;m only dealing with the internet and I can&#039;t complain!<br />anyway, we can&#039;t wait to eventually meeting all of you! <br />Good night!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Despite beating me to the move, welcome, Babycakesmama! It&#039;s good to know your daughter is an experienced babysitter. That&#039;s definitely something we&#039;ll need after we move. And like you, we&#039;re eager to meet you all!

					Thanks for the warm welcome, all. We look forward to meeting you all. My wife and I are uncommonly friendly. As a testament to that, the officiant at our wedding was actually a couple we sold a desk to over Craigslist. And two of our closest friends are people who joined us for the tour of our current apartment three years ago. We also like to entertain. I make craft cocktails as a hobby and my wife likes making cheese and fruit plates. And we both like to drink wine. Haha. So, we&#039;re definitely people persons, and really want to get to know our neighbors. And since we&#039;re only having the one baby, it&#039;s important to us that he grows up being sociable.<br /><br />So, all that to say: 100% down for a get-together!<br /><br />Since we&#039;re talking about timelines, there were a couple of questions that I had been wondering: <br /><br />1) I&#039;m also curious to know about the gym, but all the common areas in general. My understanding is that everything is being renovated. I read somewhere that the courtyard will be as well, which was confusing. What about it is being renovated?<br /><br />2) Somewhere on this thread someone said the building was being wired for Verizon FIOS. Is that true? Is that still happening? Because we&#039;d be leaving behind RCN — which we LOVE — for what appears to be TWC/Spectrum. Which feels like a special kind of torture.

					I&#039;ve been lurking on these boards (and on this thread) for about a month now, and figured it was good time to come out of the shadows, considering my wife and I have just entered into contract. Specifically, on the unit I think some people might have been watching (and was posted about in this thread): E61/62. The 4BR/3BA.<br /><br />We want this to be our &quot;forever home.&quot;<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m looking forward to joining the Jackson Heights community. I think many people had this notion that the folks who were going to buy the more expensive units were going to come from Manhattan or Brooklyn. But my wife and I (along with our two year old), live in LIC now. And before that, we lived in Jamaica, where I went to school (St. John&#039;s). So, we&#039;re coming from having experienced living at various ends of the Queens spectrum.<br /><br />All that being said, I&#039;m a bit in the same boat as Lilybell (who seems to be the matriarch of this thread — hi!). I get the impression it&#039;s a long road ahead before our unit will be complete. There are literally no walls in there right now. So, we&#039;re taking the &quot;it&#039;ll be done when it&#039;s done,&quot; approach. We&#039;re deeply invested in LIC as civic leaders in the community. So, there&#039;s really no rush for us to pick up and leave. We kid of expected to wait about six months. Until I read Lilybell&#039;s surprisingly long timeline for what is a smaller apartment. You are like a Buddhist monk.<br /><br />Nice to meet you all!<br /><br />P.S. My handle is MrPlaza because my last name is Plaza, not because I&#039;ll be living in Washington Plaza. Haha.
