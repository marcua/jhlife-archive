			Similar to the Lifers thread, I thought about this as I walked by PS 69 tonight ...<br /><br />I went to PS 69, as does my son.&nbsp; Any other 2 generation (or more??) families with our neighborhood schools out there?&nbsp; Did both you and your mother or son or daughter or father go to 69, or 145, or even 227 is around long enough now.&nbsp; Or even St Joan&#039;s or Garden (actually I went to Garden too.)<br /><br />(For that matter, I went to Bronx Science, as did my mother.&nbsp; But I&#039;m thinking locally here)

			My son and I both went the full distance at Garden.

			Yes. He had the same English teacher in upper school and my childhood friend, who became a teacher, for English in middle school.
