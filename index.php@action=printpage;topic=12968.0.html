				Hard to tell, only one apartment had its windows knocked out, now they&#039;re boarded up. Lights are on and people are moving around the rest of building. I never saw any open flames, but it was a two alarmer and fireman were in several of the apartments that I could see, walking around with flashlights, and on the roof.

				It was a kitchen fire that generated enough black smoke that people had to go out their fire escapes.&nbsp; Water damage affected at least 3 apartments below, many doors were bashed in or locks broken and many apartments and hallways still have smoke damage.&nbsp; The apartment is a charred shell.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				the one in LeFrak City was falling asleep, since residents died. perhaps people going out. i have forgotten stuff, but i have a good sense of smell, so i&#039;ve never reached peril/fire extinguisher stage. it&#039;s very sad.

				this fire was about 8-9 o clock. I supect it was a grease/oil fire which wasn&#039;t promptly extinguished, because it seemed to happen very quickly. I watched from my window. But of course I don&#039;t know, since I don&#039;t live in that building.

				I live in the building and we don&#039;t know yet.&nbsp; Fire marshall report is &quot;pending&quot; which isn&#039;t uncommon.&nbsp; Even with it pending we can go and pick up the report which is good.&nbsp; The shareholder and roommate have told several different people a different story.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our insurance company will be by this week so I&#039;m hoping they have info from the Insurance Adjuster who came the night of the fire. In the meantime the clean up and restoration for those affected is not happening fast enough.&nbsp; It amazes me how many companies take on more work then they can handle.&nbsp; &nbsp;They say they&#039;ll be there on Monday and a shareholder takes off work AND then they don&#039;t show up.&nbsp; That annoys me.&nbsp;

				Sorry to hear, buddy. Determining cause can take awhile, when there was fire in my work building in SoHo, it took well over a year for a determination to be made. Between the Saybrook, the Ravenna and now your building, we&#039;re looking hard at renter&#039;s insurance for our stuff. <br />Does your building&#039;s policy cover any &quot;loss of use&quot; for folks who are out of their apartments?
