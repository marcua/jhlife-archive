				This afternoon, the Foodtown was a full-on meltdown zone. every single cashier -- human and self-serve -- had lines halfway down the aisles, and in some cases, back to the meat counter.&nbsp; full carts, angry shoppers. i haven&#039;t seen anything like this in a grocery store since i lived through the Northridge earthquake in 1994.<br /><br />i was reminded of this classic Simpsons moment.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4m-lNi61Rk

				I saw someone tweet about a Sam&#039;s Club in Minnesota that looked like the worst Black Friday crowds ever seen. I hadn&#039;t realized it was happening in our area as well.

				Huh - yesterday it seemed if anything a bit empty, though I suppose it depends on the time of day. <br /><br />Today I was in Woodside and the Associated and Key Food (whatever it&#039;s called) and the Korean market near 61st St all seemed quiet.<br /><br />

				Twitter is full of videos of massive crowds at Costcos around the country. Like this:<br /><br />https://twitter.com/vote4dongshen/status/1233814600749060096?s=20<br /><br />Also in Flushing (although to be fair, every time I&#039;ve been to Costco in NYC on a Saturday, it&#039;s been a bit of a madhouse) so this may not be off from a normal Saturday. https://twitter.com/vote4dongshen/status/1233868272661037057?s=20

				This neighborhood supermarket is usually very busy and you’re calling it a full on meltdown. I have been living here for 35 years, and yes that store has gotten busier over the past year or two with lines down the isles. But I attribute it to with the lack of choices and the time of day you go there.&nbsp; Do you think it’s a panic because of the coronavirus?&nbsp; Spreading fake news?&nbsp; And I’ve been through quite a few earthquakes in New York, so I’m not sure of the correlation between the two. People don’t usually go shopping after an earthquake

				i have been living here for 25 years and have been going to this store for most of that time. since i am a block away from it, i go to it at least four or five times a week. i&#039;ve never once seen it like this. let me know if you&#039;ve spent more than 25 minutes on a checkout line there.<br /><br />you&#039;ve never been through an earthquake in New York. trust me. the earthquakes in New York didn&#039;t kill dozens of people or destroy entire neighborhoods.&nbsp; the earthquakes in New York didn&#039;t bring down buildings. they didn&#039;t take the electrical grid off-line. <br /><br />thanks, Jixxie. always good for a laugh.<br /><br /><strong><em>[Moderators note: Revised with permission of the author.]</em></strong>

				By the way, they receive their bread twice a week half baked. And then they finish cooking it in their kitchen. If you get here that day or the next day or two and it’s still warm and crusty it’s really good. I like the choices of bread better here than any place in the neighborhood.
