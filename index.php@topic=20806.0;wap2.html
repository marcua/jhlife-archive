			I hope you are all healthy and safe. <br /><br />After 7 1/2 years without a studio, I am finally signing a lease tomorrow on an amazing new space in Woodside (33-46 55th street btwn 37th and Broadway) in a brand new studio building.&nbsp; I can not afford it alone and am looking for someone to share the space with me.&nbsp; The space is 19&#039; x 12&#039; and is $850 month (so $425 each). This includes all utilities (superfast Wifi, heat, electricity, and AC!).&nbsp; <br /><br />The spaces are just being built out by owner and Jackson Heights artist Deborah Wasserman who has been running other studios across the street for 10+ years.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s going to be a wonderful small community of professional artists,&nbsp; 7 studios total with a shared kitchen and bathroom. The studio is an interior space but it has a skylight and is well ventilated.&nbsp; One block from M/R train @ Northern Blvd. Deborah is hoping for a move in date of January 1st. <br /><br />I am looking for someone who would be there during the day since I will only be there a couple of evenings a week starting at 4/5pm and some weekend days. Looking for someone who works mostly digital since I need a clean space. Writers, photographers, video artists, filmmakers, graphic designers, remote workers in need of office space are welcome!&nbsp; &nbsp;If interested, please email me off list. Jess@jesslevey.com <br /><br />Thank You!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jess Levey<br />
