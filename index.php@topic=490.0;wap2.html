			<strong>Chuckster</strong>:
			<br />
			For the past year or so, I&#039;ve been tracking the Corcoran website and have noticed that they mostly list Manhattan and Brooklyn properties.&nbsp; They may have some representation in the Hamptons as well.&nbsp; What&#039;s odd is that if you perform a search on their website, you&#039;ll see that they also represent the areas of Astoria and Long Island City.&nbsp; No mention of Queens as a whole though.&nbsp; Hmmm....&nbsp; Is it safe to assume that in the eyes of Corcoran, other neighborhoods in Queens lack the hipster vibe? <br /><br />Take a look at the street where they&#039;ve set up shop.&nbsp; Not exactly a glamorous spot. :o<br /><br />From Brownstoner:<br /><br />http://www.brownstoner.com/brownstoner/archives/2008/02/corco_sets_up_s.php
