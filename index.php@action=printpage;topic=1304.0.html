				Hi,<br /><br />I heard that Dines Farms was looking at the space on the south side of Northern between 81 &amp; 80th, where the Betel Furniture place was. I had my doubts as that is really a very large store front. <br /><br />I walk past frequently but haven&#039;t seen any progress, nor heard anything on the jhfamilies site.<br /><br />Another empty one on Northern near the fire house.

				I heard that Dines Farms was passing on the site which they had been considering (the former Betel furniture store on Northern b/w 80 &amp; 81). There is now an empty long-distance phone place next to that empty store as well.&nbsp; I heard that the former Betel is going to become an &quot;upscale Mexican&quot; restaurant. I just hope they get a liquor license quickly and I&#039;ll be there!
