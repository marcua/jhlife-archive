			Lately, I&#039;ve been really into big salads from the likes of by Chloe, Chopt, etc.. What are recommendations for really good salads in JH? I have enjoyed the kale ones at Laly&#039;s, but can&#039;t think of any other standouts at the moment.

			I actually had a really good salad from El Toum last night. The Lebanese Salad to be exact. It was not very expensive, maybe $8, and a very generous portion. <br /><br />I also LOVE (and I mean LOVE) the Signature Salad at Just Made for U!<br /><br />
