				<strong>Wine of the Day: Jean Leon 3055 Merlot</strong><br /><br />Let us share with you the story behind this legend Jean Leon. Jean Leon, a young idealist who broke new ground in difficult times and saw his dreams come true from creating the most prestigious restaurant in Hollywood, La Scala to the famous Jean Leon 3055. Today, the memory of that great man and his singular adventure comes to mind every time we uncork the wine that bears his name: Jean Leon. Wonder what 3055 stand for?

			<dd class="postbody">
				The Other is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah.&nbsp; The Peirano vineyard had a unique way to make wines. They make sure their vines struggle a little bit, through techniques like deficit irrigation, to help concentrate the fruit flavors. Tasting notes, vibrant color and aromas of blackberry and plums are complimented by spice, toasty oak and cedar notes. A wave of black cherries and a hint of smoky dark oak lead to a long seductive finish.

				Wine of the Day: Fattoria Victiccio Toscana Bere 2011.<br />Bere is from Tuscany, Italy. Is a blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet, and 25% Merlot, making this wine a “Super Tuscan”. The term “Super Tuscan” describes any Tuscan red wine that does not adhere to traditional blending laws for the region. Super Tuscans often use other grapes, especially Cabernet, making them ineligible for DOC(G) classification.This wine has a beautiful nose of ripe red fruit – cherry and strawberry. The full palate has loads of lush fruit – black raspberry and cherry. The tannins are mild and well integrated. This wine makes a lovely match with pan-roasted filet mignon with mushroom and red wine sauce.

				Every Wine has a story, but many are forgotten fast or shall never be mentioned. This one stuck with me. We in general are intrinsically curious. We alwyays ask why? We are driven to the point that we seek to explain the unexplainable, going as far as placing huge mirrors in the universe to look even deeper into the dark. One of these mirrors is called the Hubble telescope, and is best accessed from an observatory on top of the Andes Cordilleras named Tololo.Famous for its uniquely crisp and clear, unpolluted night skies, here at the grand junction between man, curiosity and the surrounding universe, here at the Earth’s opposite side of Lhasa, the Himalaya’s spiritual center, where tales of indigenous people report of similar powers, no grapes are grown, here is where ideas are.&nbsp; And as every wine is not only the result of nature’s own doing but also an expression of man’s confrontation with nature, Tololo stands for exactly this: Curiosity.<br />The label on the bottle is a simple representation of the above idea, he who is curious is looking up into the night sky: the observatory (open dot) connects the Hubble (blue star) with the Sun (golden sun), Moon and stars (red point), and we watch from below. <br />Tasting notes: Pretty mixture of boysenberry, blackberry and cherry fruit notes, mid palate of noble tannins leading into a slightly peppered finish.

				Wine of the Day: Domaine Mas Barrau - 100% Cabernet Franc<br />This wine has a Lovely black fruit&nbsp; with a robust rich palate, a full-bodied wine with real warmth and depth. There is a wild ripeness of sweet scented fruit twinned with an edgy woodland perfume. The palate is incredibly long and very rich - scrumptiously juicy fleshy Rhone flavours are counterbalanced and intertwined with the savoury crunchy rooty character of Cabernet Franc.<br />

				Hi NYC Native,<br /><br />No, &quot;Super Tuscans&quot; wine is what they are referring to specifically to Bere. This wine is not a table wine. While California red are popular among many resturants, we do have a selections of good California wines, more specifically a Zinfandel called, &quot;Wild Thing&quot; from Mendocino Country is one of our most popular red wine. All our wines are very selective, please stop by anytime to our wine shop for some tasting. We host wine tasting every Fridays and Saturdays. Looking forward meeting you. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				Wine of the Day: INURRIETA SUR from Spain<br />A blend of Garnacha and Graciano. Inurrieta SUR has pleasing aromas of blackberry, ripe fruit, and a little cinnamon spice. The predominant flavors when tasting are fruity and sweet with black cherry cola notes. This wine has a silky mouthfeel and good balance. It has a nice long finish and velvety smooth tannins. We found this wine to at its best on the first day. The texture and flavor of this wine bring to mind one of my favorite treats, gelato.

				Oh, yes - I understood that the Super Tuscans are not table wines (as per Italian standards) my questions was that if there any other blended wines beside the super tuscan.&nbsp; I think that table wines are considered inferior in Europe but that in reality, blended wines can be more pleasing then single grape (varietals?)<br /><br />Have you posted your wine tasting dates?<br /><br />Thank You and glad you are part of JHL !!!

				Most Italian wines are blended. We do have a great selection on Italian wines. Honestly, now that you have bought the question up, I&#039;ll have to look and see if there are any single grape wines from Italy that are as good as the blend. Stay tune, will have an update. <br /><br />We host wine tasting every Fridays and Saturdays from 6 to 9 pm. I posted it on the Chat forum called, &quot;Wine Tasting&quot;<br />I also add them to the Calendar as well, but been busy for the past week, forgot to post them. <br /><br />Please stop by. <br /><br />

				Wine of the Day: Lacrima di Morro d’Alba. Alba, Italy<br /><br />Mario Lucchetti began in the 1980s with the first acres of Lacrima di Morro d’Alba. His passion focused on restoring the importance of the area’s native varietals. With new plantings in 2004, the estate’s total vineyard size expanded to 14 hectares and continues to grow today. In recent years, Mario’s son Paolo completed his degree in enology and is now working side by side with his father to carry the family tradition into the next decades. The focal point of the winery is their basic Lacrima bottling, but they also produce the “Guardengo” single-vineyard bottling as well as an Amarone style Lacrima made from partially dried grapes. Lacrima di Morro d’Alba is an indigenous dark purple grape that exemplifies the Marche wine region. On average, the grapes are harvested in the first ten days of September and vinified using the traditional method to make a very pleasant, ready-to-drink wine with the unmistakable bouquet of violets and wild strawberries. Fruity yet exotic and concentrated, this wine is delightful paired with traditional salami and Italian coldcuts, roasted meats and grilled sausages and is perfect for spring and fall.<br /><br />Lacrima Di Morro D’Alba 2012.<br />Deep violet in color, the wine explodes out of the glass with an extremely intense and heady bouquet of exotic Eastern flowers and wild strawberries and pomegranate. Once past the intriguing nose, the palate features wild berry compote, hints of roses, violets and geranium, a note of pink peppercorn and finishes very fresh with limited tannins. An utterly unique experience featuring outstanding balance and concentration. Personally,&nbsp; this is one of my favorite wine.

				Wine of the Day: Eurynome Red 2010, Greece<br /><br />Greek mythology paints the goddess Eurynome as one who began life.&nbsp; Because she had nowhere to call her own, she left the sky and on the waves of the sea danced with grace as she united wisdom and divinity while forming the elements of the earth. <br /><br />Eurynome Red 2010 – With this bottle of wine from PDO Goumenissa and consisting of 70% Xinomavro and 30% Negoska grapes both of which were grown organically. A beautiful ruby red color and aromas of cherries, plums, and spice. Tastes of cherries, cranberries, hazelnuts, and a touch of black pepper.&nbsp; With the intense acidity and structure of Xinomavro and the high alcohol yet soft tannins and acidity of Negoska, it was no surprise that this dry and balanced wine would have a smooth finish after having been aged for twelve months in new French oak and six more months in the bottle.

				Wine of the Day: Blink, Greek sparkling wine<br /><br />Given a 90 points from Wine and Spirits and “Best Buy” recommendation (August 2013 issue), Blink is the modern expression of Greek sparkling; a new, natural, brut sparkling wine, from Zibibbo grapes of the volcanic terroir of Lemnos island.<br />Grape is 100% Muscat of Alexandria (Zibibbo). Blink provides an intense and lengthy bubbly experience. The color is light yellow with soft aromas of almond flowers, pear, apricot, lemon, jasmin, rose and yeast, as well as citrus notes. Good structure with a flowery palate that starts off smoothly, with a pleasant acidity and metallicity, ending with a refreshing caramel aftertaste. Paired well with spicy delicacies, sweet-sour dishes, as well as light desserts with dark chocolate or fruits.

				Wine of the Day: Laderas de Inurrieta, Spain<br /><br />100% Graciano. Graciano is a black-skinned grape variety that is rarely seen outside its home territory in northern Spain. Principally located in Rioja and Navarra, Graciano is one of those grape varieties that are more likely to be mentioned on the back label than the front. It is highly prized for its intense aromatic properties, but is notoriously low-yielding in the vineyard. Consequently, it is not widely planted and typically appears alongside Tempranillo and Garnacha in various interpretations of the red Rioja blend. Has a very intense cherry red color, almost opaque. Aroma of good intensity, with wood (fine quality) in the foreground, with toasty notes (peat, graphite), accompanied by an intense fruitiness (plums) and a chocolate background. The palate shows a good structure, acidity, lively, great fruit intensity and a very long finish and very smooth. This wine will be available for tasting tonight.

				Wine of the Day: Gran Vinaio, Spain<br /><br />Grape: 100% Red Grenache<br /><br />This crowd pleaser Gran Vinaio was the talk of the night at The Latino Show Magazine Awards 2014t! <br /><br />This Gran Vinaio is a marvelous and unique Grenache. Deep concentrated fruit shows through with black opal and brick red at the core and throughout. The nose offers bright red fruit layered with white pepper and herbaceous anise. This wine has a twist: The approach is soft and elegant, the middle is fat with good fruit and the finish brings a masculine and powerful onset of tannin – top side, barrel, spice, deeper fruit on the middle-side and a lingering finish. <br />

				Wine of the Day: Pandeia White<br /><br />Grape: Assyrtiko 100%<br /><br />Let us take you to Greek! Pandeia is the mysterious Greek goddess of the full moon and soft dew, both of which disappear in the morning sun. Elusive to mere mortals, little mention of her fleeting beauty remains, but her namesake wine conjures her image and rewrites her myth.<br /><br />Like the yellow- green cast of moonlight in the glass, this wine is aromatic with cream and fresh peach, with a medium body and a long lasting ripe peach and white fruit flavors, supported by citrus notes. Both memorable and ephemeral as the goddess herself.<br /><br />This wine will be available for tasting tomorrow from 6 to 9pm.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sorry, no image due to upload size limited. <br /><br /><br /><br />

The nose has many tropical fruit and green apple notes to it. This wine also shows vanilla and oak notes when tasting due to it being fermented and aged in French oak casks.<br /><br />We enjoy this chardonnay a lot and believe it also to be cellar worthy for a year to 18 month. Rich, buttery, slightly oaky and still manages to show its fruit. Lump crab cakes, snow crab or Pacific salmon will all pair well with this wonderful chardonnay from Argentina.

				Wine of the Day: PAGOS DEL GALIR GODELLO LÍAS 2012<br /><br />In the Spanish denomination of Valdeorras, we can find the Virxen del Galir winery that is actively recovering some very rare and nearly extinct native grape varietals. One of these grapes is Godello, the white grape used to craft this incredible white wine. <br />A golden-yellow colored wine with green reflections. The nose of this wine has loads of fresh white fruits alongside great floral aromas and a tough of raisins and limes.<br />The palate of this wine is dense and fresh with a long passage that is very expressive of this unique varietal. We can also clearly taste that this white wine has been aged in its lees.<br /><br />OUR PERSONAL OPINION:<br /><br />This is a very silky and fresh white wine that is very expressive and has been a pleasant surprise for us.

It is sourced from a vineyard dedicated to producing rosé and is Grenache dominant combined with Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Dolcetto.

				Wine of the Day: Palacio de Vivero Verdejo/Viura, Spain<br /><br />The Palacio de Vivero is a refreshing summer quaffer. It comes from Rueda, a DO (Denominación de Origen) located in the Northwestern portion of Spain. The region is known primarily for its white wines based on the Verdejo grape. The Palacio de Vivero is a blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura. Verdejo grapes are generally harvested at night. This means that the grapes enter the cellar at the lower night time temperatures, lower temperatures means less oxidation, or browning of the juice. Viura, also called Macabeo, is seen often in White Rioja and also as part of the blend to make Cava, Spain’s best known sparkling wine.<br /><br />The Palacio de Vivero has a very aromatic nose, an attribute of the Verdejo grape. It smells of cactus pear and key lime. In the mouth you get a fair dose of nice bright acid to balance out the ripe green fruit flavors of kiwi and pear.<br /><br />Pair this wine, mid-week with a super fast, super satisfying dinner of steamed Mussels, a quick salad, and some fresh bread.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wine of the Day: TRIGA, Spain<br /><br />The Spanish enologist, Rafael Canizares, seeks to achieve the maximum expression of every grape he works with. Triga is the new Clio. If your a fan of the Clio, Triga will blow your mind. The label is an expression of thge name. In the local areas of Spain, Triga is wheat and the label expresses this with Crop Circles that have plagued this part of Spain for generations.<br /><br />This Spanish red that is made up of 85% Mourvedre and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a Opaque purple. Explosive black and blue fruit aromas are complicated by notes of licorice, Indian spices and floral oils. Rich and expansive but showing unlikely finesse thanks to bright acidity. Sweet blueberry and cassis flavors stain the palate and linger on a very long, intensely spicy, focused finish. <br /><br /><br />

				Wine of the Day: Pago de los Capellanes Reserva 2008<br /><br />This wine will be available for tasting tonight. You do not want to miss this sip! <br /><br />A classic from Ribera del Duero with the pure expression of the region&#039;s terroir. It goes through a very careful elaboration with the minimum intervention possible. Slow malolactic fermentation for one month with its own yeasts. This wine is aged for 18 months in new French oak barrels and rests in the bottle for at least 18 months more. It is recommended to decant this wine one hour before serving it in order to appreciate it better and to avoid the possible sediments (this wine has not been clarified nor filtered). <br />It can be stored and aged for long (for the next 10 years). <br />A very elegant wine to be enjoyed at every sip, serious and extremely nice Spanish wine from Ribera del Duero with an embracing attack, which gives way to abundant notes of very tasty ripe fruit, wrapped in creamy and noble toasted aromas. It shows a silky, very friendly, even sweety mid palate with a very good acidity and well integrated tannins. Long and elegant finish with a great persistence.

				Wine of The Day: Corgo Da Régua Douro 2012, Douro, Portugal<br /><br /><br />Grapes: Tempranillo, Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Barroca<br /><br />Winemaker Emídio Bacelar has crafted a judicious blend of four Port grapes: superstar variety Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), Touriga Franca and Tinta Barroca. The grapes are carefully selected, with subpar berries being discarded and left for the local boars. Grapes are trodden by bare human foot (perfect for the task!) in granite lagares (troughs), in the traditional fashion. <br /><br />The starkly-beautiful Douro region in northern Portugal is famous for its fortified wine, Port, but in actual fact production here is evenly split between Port and table wines. The terraced, vertiginous slopes that characterise the region are composed of unforgiving schist and granite, a terroir that is ideal for the production of high-quality wine.<br /><br />The Corgo Da Regua 2012 is Vivid and intense, with inviting aromas of blueberry and violet. The wash is rich, spicy and exotic, with attractively-chalky tannins and delicious flavours of blackberry liquor, allspice and bashed peppercorn. Juicy, structured and very good.<br /><br />Decant for an hour and have with well-seared ribeye or stuffed Portobello mushroom burgers on this Portgual Day! <br />

				Wine of the Day: Purple Star<br /><br />Fourth of July is this Friday.&nbsp; As we celebrate, fireworks, BBQ, Picnics, get together Reunions. This Purple Star Wine are a fit for Wine of the Day and Week. Here is the story of Purple Star Wine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Purple Star Wines, In 2008 Kyle and Amy Johnson set out to start a winery with a specific vision: Our philosophy is that wine should be accessible, approachable, and affordable. But most of all, we believe a wine’s purpose is to bring together family and friends!<br /><br />Paying It Forward As a family, they&nbsp; find themselves blessed with good health. Their good fortune, however, comes with a realization that others are less fortunate. As a result they have chosen to donate 15% of Purple Star Wines’ proceeds to Seattle Children’s Hospital to benefit uncompensated care—a gesture we hope will lighten the financial burden of families overwhelmed by the expenses associated with critical medical care. It’s their way of “paying it forward.”<br /><br />Purple Star’s varietal blends are grown from some of Washington State’s finest appellations including Wahluke Slope, Yakima Valley and Red Mountain. With grapes handpicked at their optimal flavor profile and juice fermented at cooler temperatures for longer periods, our wines exhibit softer tannins and retain more varietal character.<br /><br />Featuring Purple Star 2013 Chardonnay has an aromas of green apple, pear, smoke and marshmallow, carry through a structured mid palate with balanced natural acidity.<br /><br />95% Caliche Lake Vineyard - Ancient Lakes AVA<br />5% Kiona Vineyard - Red Mountain<br />Direct to press, cold settled overnight. Caliche portion fermented with CY3079 in stainless steel. Kiona barrel fermented with indigenous yeast in 100% new French Oak. Both lots were kept sur lie for 6 months.<br />

This 2011 bottling of this distinctive blend opens with a dazzling spectrum of fruit and floral aromas, from crisp white peach, honeyed pear and sweet mango, to touches of fresh jasmine blossom and white chai tea. Filled with bright and juicy fruits, the palate flaunts flavors of succulent white nectarine, candied pineapple, green fig and subtle grapefruit. The crisp and slightly off-dry flavor profile lasts well through the clean and refreshing finish.<br /><br />With its balanced acidity, this versatile wine pairs well with a number of dishes, from light salads to seafood to, most notably, foods with a hint of spiciness — its subtle sweetness provides balance alongside a touch of heat. Try Chenin Blanc + Viognier with a flavorful Thai curry, a sushi dish, such as a spicy tuna roll, or seared halibut.

				Wine of the Day: Eurynome white 2012<br />According to the oldest of Greek myth, life began with the goddess Eurynome. Having nowhere to rest, she split sky from sea, then danced gracefully on the waves, birthing the elemental entirety of the earth; uniting wisdom and divinity. Her namesake wine is the result of equally comprehensive winemaking.<br /><br />MADE WITH ORGANIC Roditis Grape: 100%<br /><br />The light and fruity Roditis (literally “rose”) is one of the oldest and most renowned Greek grapes, features the aroma of basil and ginger, with fruity cues of apple and banana sweetness. Light and delicate in the mouth, with a lingering finish.

				Wine of the Day: Palacio de Vivero, Spain<br /><br />The Palacio de Vivero is a refreshing summer wine. It comes from Rueda,located in the Northwestern portion of Spain. The region is known primarily for its white wines based on the Verdejo grape. The Palacio de Vivero is a blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura. Verdejo grapes are generally harvested at night. This means that the grapes enter the cellar at the lower nighttime temperatures, lower temperatures means less oxidation, or browning of the juice. Viura, also called Macabeo, is seen often in White Rioja and also as part of the blend to make Cava, Spain’s best known sparkling wine.<br /><br />The Palacio de Vivero has a very aromatic nose, an attribute of the Verdejo grape. It smells of cactus pear and key lime. In the mouth you get a fair dose of nice bright acid to balance out the ripe green fruit flavors of kiwi and pear. Perfectly for a summer drink!

				WE NOW HAVE #KOSHER WINE! <br /><br />Wine of the Day: Ugav Cabernet Sauvignon 2011, Israel<br /><br />Jerusalem Winery was established in 1976 and is located in northern Jerusalem. The winery is kosher lemehadrin, under the supervision of Bedatz Beit Yosef and the Chabad Rabbinical Court. It produces a variety of wines and its vineyards are located in prime wine growing areas. Their Cabernet Sauvignon 2011, which is Kosher for Passover, stood out to us as one of the best reds we tasted; balanced with a nice structure, plenty of fruit and very food friendly (great with brisket!). This wine is equally enjoyable sipped on its own as a cocktail, with a cheese plate or other appetizers as an aperitif wine and a great addition on your holiday table!<br /><br />Tasting Note: A dark plum color, this wine has aromas of cherries, cloves and cinnamon gives way to a full bodied palate filled with dark berries, cocoa, cedar and violet notes with soft tannins and nice concentration. Very approachable and versatile.

				Wine of the Day:Di Gresy Moscato La Serra 2013, Italy<br /><br />Now that summer is here, we are thirsty for this easy, fizzy, tropical-fruit-scented white. At just 5 percent alcohol by volume, it&#039;s ideal for Sunday brunch. And no, &quot;La Serra&quot; does not mean &quot;evening,&quot; although this wine works well with a spring fruit tart or strawberry shortcake at the end of a meal. It actually means &quot;greenhouse&quot; -- yet another reason to sip it while the early-summer fruits and vegetables are coming into season.<br /><br />Intense, full, and harmonious on the palate, it is an excellent dessert wine with biscuits, dry cakes and fruit. Available now!&nbsp;
