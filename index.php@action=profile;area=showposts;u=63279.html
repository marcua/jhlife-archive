					Well if it’s any sign of positive action, I did notice that the Dept of Sanitation posted a sign on the Burger King today saying they were going to come do a site cleanup. Has it happened? Not sure. Do I hope the landlord/owner of that building got slapped with a fine so big it knocks them back? You bet.

Some thoughts:<br />- Danny Dromm and Francisco Moya - but don&#039;t get your hopes up because these two have proven to be pretty useless<br />- 311: The more calls/complaints logged the better - it focuses the city&#039;s attention on this issue<br />- Community Board 3 - as I posted on the other (now locked) thread, other city community boards have been transparent about homeless outreach. Ours has not. <br />- 82nd Street BID<br />- 115th Precinct - for those that exhibit violent and/or lewd behavior. Hearing that they are exposing themselves to children makes my blood boil.<br />

					The situation is horrifically sad. Just because something is “legal” or decriminalized (ie public urination), doesn’t make it right.<br /><br />I’ve lived in this neighborhood for 5 years and while we’ve always had some vagrancy, it’s never been this bad. Walking from 72nd street past the post office, up to 88th street, I must have encountered a dozen (at least) drunk men. One got in my face aggressively to ask for money, one was crawling by the 82nd street bust stop bc he was too drunk to stand. An older man was sprawled out unconscious, contorted in such a such a way, clutching a vodka bottle. <br /><br />These were only a few of the encounters just yesterday. It’s unacceptable. I’m getting very close to moving because if this is the accepted norm in the community, then I realize our values don’t align.<br /><br />And Dssjh, I have lots of friends in what you would probably call “gentrified” Brooklyn:<br />Brooklyn Heights, Carroll Gardens, cobble hill, downtown Brooklyn, and fort Greene. The level of street litter and random drunk men pale in comparison to here.<br /><br />Actually come to think of it, Hudson Yards is as clean as a whistle. Soho and West Vill looked pretty great the last time I was there. Hmm…

					While we try to establish who does and doesn&#039;t have expertise, let&#039;s all do something which I KNOW we are all Grade A, PHD-level experts in...<br /><br />Using our fingers (<em>and thumbs...and voices</em>) to call and write to the elected officials, 311, and city agencies to ensure that we are being heard, our complaints are being recorded, and hopefully that translates into increased services to the area.<br /><br />We all agree that the situation is untenable, correct? We need to be a united front now more than ever. There may not be a consensus as to the tone taken towards addressing the problem, but it seems clear that we know what we need to do to get the adequate services for these individuals and resources to the community. I hate to say it but we have to show up. We have to complain like hell and keep following up even if we get no response.&nbsp;

					I do have an update after speaking to the retail management company. Couple things:<br /><br />1. The former Burger King space has been rented as of last week. New occupant plans to take possession within the next 2-3 weeks. Cleanup/buildout is first priority. No update on what the tenant is - they were not able to share. Please lord let us hope this is true and is a solid deal.<br /><br />2. Another resource to reach out to in addition to the resources Shelby shared (thank you!) would be the 82nd Street BID. They represent business interests primarily, but have mentioned that not a single Jackson Heights resident or owner has reached out to them about this issue (not sure if that&#039;s true, but that is what was said). They use our voices/support/involvement to get additional support from the city. It&#039;s important to show them that we care as well. <br /><br /><br />On a side note - I still don&#039;t understand how CB3, which works directly across the street, doesn&#039;t address this issue! Like WHAT?

I actually will do the same (again...sigh). On Nextdoor, there is a whole thread about Poop Alley, so I might link to that as well.&nbsp; I worry tremendously that Danny Dromm is just going to disregard us as a bunch of NIMBY bigots. Have you seen his response to a lady on Facebook when she brought up vendors on 34th Avenue? He straight up called her a racist on a public forum. If that&#039;s the mindset he&#039;s in, it&#039;s truly no wonder why nothing gets done about the situation here. <br /><br />Moya doesn&#039;t seem to comment publicly like that, but I am not sure he&#039;s focused on these quality of life issues.<br /><br />I would also recommend calling the building management and being a squeaky wheel: Kent Realty: 718.353.8368. I called them back in April (Still saved the VM), where they told me they&#039;re aware but there&#039;s &quot;nothing they can do.&quot; Um, YEAH RIGHT. How about at least a power wash? Why not board it up like the space further down the block? I just don&#039;t get people&#039;s apathy.

Instead of calling for policing and punishment, how about some compassion? If one feels strongly about not wanting to see people passed out drunk on the sidewalks in the neighborhood, consider joining or starting a group to give them the help and support they need to get them off the streets and simultaneously improve their well-being and the health of the neighborhood.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m just going to be the one to say it. I am maxed out on compassion. Empathy, compassion, excuses, and endless understanding/coddling is getting us as a community nowhere and clearly not helping these individuals either. I have called DHS/311 many times and personally witnessed a refusal of outreach efforts as well and the situation keeps getting worse, not better. We&#039;re complaining about 82nd street, but has anyone even been to the corner of 83rd and Roosevelt? It&#039;s literally a poop-strewn toilet now. Literal poop on the walls and sidewalk. What is HAPPENING to this neighborhood?<br /><br />Back to 82nd Street...I&#039;ve had to leap over a streaming flow of urine in realtime. I have to hold my breath to walk down the block to get to the subway. I actually LIVE on the block and I am now strongly considering moving out of the neighborhood because I am realizing that I am just not aligned to what&#039;s happening here. Living like this is not acceptable to me. It&#039;s stressful, unpleasant, and there just seems to be a general apathy from our elected officials. They&#039;d rather focus on 34th Avenue, as if that&#039;s the ONLY block that matters in Jackson Heights.<br />

Danny Dromm is so checked out. He’s useless.

It has gone from 1-2 men to upwards of 8-10. And for the record sometimes they do sleep on top of one another.<br /><br />The quality of life on the block is horrendous. The stench permeates even across the street. And, on more than one occasion I have stepped over a stream from them urinating live. It’s so depressing. So what do you suggest we do? Just let it be? No. There has to be some middle ground. These men need to be placed in a shelter where they can receive adequate food and have access to necessities. Living under an awning is not a viable solution for any of us.
