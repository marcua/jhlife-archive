				&nbsp; It appears that Covid will be with us for awhile longer but many in the community are back at work, in school, keeping appts, home improvements, etc. Should this be the time where we have a dialogue about the lag in use mid-day of the 34th Ave Open Streets? The darker nights that will be here shortly make for an unsafe amount of visibility for those later hours too. <br />&nbsp; The hours that the street is happily in use seem to be early, as in the 8-10am time and then somewhere in the 2:30- 3:00 to 6-7. Opening the street to alternate needs for schools, seniors, residents, deliveries, sanitation crews, etc. would be very welcome to those who live on the avenue. It seems like a reasonable and fair compromise to have a dialogue about and it&#039;s one that neighbors would very much welcome.

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">I love your suggestions on the change of hours. I believe that the people who manage this OS would find it difficult to move the barricades so many time per day.&nbsp; Perhaps we can come up with an easier plan.<br /><br />We need to work together as a community to see what we can come up with. And we must remember to work around the idea that the elderly and disabled can manage it and also get their necessary services. Also remembering the disabled children using the special school buses.<br /><br />Please join our discussions on FACEBOOK at:https://www.facebook.com/groups/370192364142041</span>

				^^seems like you&#039;re speaking for all the residents of the avenue when you say what they as a uniform group would welcome.<br /><br />Practically speaking, you have to address how to actually open up and shut down the Open Street 4 times a day. Currently, that is done by volunteers. The logistics of doubling the manpower necessary to do that makes me weary just thinking about. People have to actually manage this stuff, and those people at present are volunteers.<br /><br />Rather than debating online on a forum that holds no sway with our elected representative in the city government or DoT, I think it&#039;s better to participate in the DoT&#039;s forums for the OS. There have been many, many sessions since fall 2020.<br /><br />I&#039;s worth noting that just a few months ago there was a primary for the city council seat opening up. Almost every block on 34th Avenue went for the guy who supports OS. There&#039;s a general election in November. 34th Avenue residents can vote for the Libertarian who wants to end 34th Avenue OS.

Are volunteers going to move the barriers for years on end, for example Hoping for clarity where all sides are listened to in a reasonable fashion by outside evaluators and real bonafide city planners. They are out there and any professionally managed project would want their feedback before solidifying any plans of this magnitude.

				Most of the groups you identified can and do use the street during the day. There is no restriction of access, just the minor inconvenience of moving the barricade and then hopefully move it back. <br />In the occasional case of someone who is handicapped or too frail to move the barrier on their own, there are always other people around, and the majority of the people in our neighborhood would have no problem assisting someone who needs it if asked. <br />As far as the &quot;darker&quot; nights, we have streetlights and headlights, it&#039;s never really dark around here.

				&nbsp;No one wants to demonize and belief me, some of us have had mucho contact with the DOT. They say that they are not - and should not be- the last word on 34th Ave Open Streets. This project has become so divisive in the neighborhood, I do not envy their jobs either. But the lack of interest in really seriously examining what is working here and almost more importantly, not working, is incredulous to me. Why would you not want to investigate options to volunteers moving the gates in a very public and not just online forum? I personally have suggested we follow the Rockaway Boardwalk example of small golf cart-type things that NYPD Community style officers or Traffic officers drive up and down the streets, maybe 2 at the most, at a time. This might alleviate the need for heavy barriers and cones (or something lightweight) could be used as enforcement would<br />be nearby. This would help with the speeding e-bikes, the fears of seniors and less abled crossing or getting ride shares without getting trampled and a host of other issues.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, we have tried to ask these questions. Repeatedly. And no one wants to demonize anyone here and apologies if it comes across that way, but all highly impacted parties are not at the table, in my opinion, and we need to do a much better job evaluating this 34th Ave Open Street Project. What is the pushback about as I seriously do not understand the lack of interest to get this right?

				&nbsp;Open Streets closure today at 6:00pm. Hallelujah that there is going to be some compromise and tailoring of the Open Streets project based on circumstances like weather. Maybe we can see a<br />break in the cloud cover here...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a question of if it offends, which in and of itself is not an apology, but rather a question of what kind of framing of other people&#039;s perspectives, motivations, and thoughts creates an atmosphere for functional communication and resolution.<br /><br />We all know, or we should know anyway, that when we have a conflict with our SO, the moment one of us starts saying &quot;you always do X&quot; or &quot;you never think about Y&quot; the person saying that is very likely engaging in distorted thinking of has a distorted perception, because almost no one always or never does anything. It also immediately puts our partners in the position of having to defend themselves. The same holds true for community based conversations. If people could just stop painting those who hold a different opinion as the devil incarnate, maybe a productive conversation could happen.<br /><br />And finally, I think a lot of people think of DoT as an agency that can be relied upon to act based on data. Whatever the administration is obviously influences direction. But given who the next mayor likely is, I wouldn&#039;t count on a loss of city support for the OS program.

These people argue that the OS is bad for people with disabilities and elderly people, while dismissing actual people with disabilities and elderly people who support the program.&nbsp; The people against the OS are creating a false argument that somehow the supporters want conflict between pedestrians &amp; bikes, that we want to impede people from getting grocery deliveries, or being picked up by access-a-ride.&nbsp; We, of course, don&#039;t want those things - we just feel that any of them can be addressed with good design.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure, itsit, who you think you think you are convincing by continually posting about this here - it&#039;s a bit like posting anonymous complaints about your co-op board in the public spaces in your building - it may feel good, but it&#039;s not actually doing anything to accomplish what you say you want

				Most folks have chosen their sides concerning this issue . I doubt anyone is ever swayed by posts on this or any other forum. <br /><br />Basically...it&#039;s pro car lobby versus the pro pedestrian lobby.<br /><br />The spirit of the times is moving towards pro pedestrian. As is obvious by the various continuing successful street closures in Manhattan. <br /><br />The future is clear. Whether folks are happy or unhappy about the future to do with this...simply depends on their stance.

				&nbsp;Abcd... would ever give us an idea of how you life without any cars/buses/garbage trucks/delivery trucks/ambulances/firetrucks/access a rides/walkers, etc come in and out of buildings on 34th without difficulty in the window of time the street is closed?

Most people are in neither lobby. Most people walk sometimes and ride in vehicles at other times. That&#039;s why there are streets and sidewalks. In Long Island there are many communities with no sidewalks, since no one walks anywhere. If you want to close 34th Avenue, fine. But first resolve the issues this causes, which are obvious. Don&#039;t wait until later and say no one said anything. And deal with the electric vehicles on the Avenue that obey no regulations.

The list will go on as more and more pedestrian friendly spaces are planned for NYC.<br /><br />This is a global phenomenon in first world countries.

				And I enjoy the open space on 34th ave... totally different vibe than being crammed onto a small sidewalk. For those that think the solution is to build more parks, please build them first and please have those revolve around the upper 80’s to 90’s near 34th so we can have easy access near our footsteps instead of walking 10 blocks. Mb I’ll feel OS isn’t needed then. <br /><br />Quick design Q on those that are claiming accessibility issues. Aren’t most accessibility ramps typically located on the side of the buildings anyways and not in the front where the streets are closed off? Also, the sidewalks are narrow and are actually not great here in JH so bring able to use the primarily smooth roads to walk/push a wheelchair is a blessing. Speaking from the POV of someone who has a fully disabled parent.

Besides, there are plenty of parks with road ways in them (i.e. Eastern Parkway).

				&nbsp;Do we think it&#039;s wise to make permanent plans for a post pandemic situation without allowing the pandemic to subside? Let&#039;s assess needs then, see where the financials are in the city, look at the overall flow of the neighborhood and vote, yes vote, where the information is wide disseminated and not only with online contact. A real vote and real plans made with data collected by electronic sources along the avenue could tell us as a community who is in favor and who is not. The DOT is treading lightly and listening, and listening, because they are the first call if traffic flow collapses here in JH.<br /><br />&nbsp; BTW a few real estate parcels are available for a community center and the one that stands out the most is the parking lot on Northern Blvd next to the 115th which the city already owns. It&#039;s been talked about for years and this might be the time to make paradise (a community center!) out of a parking lot. Money from Biden for Infrastructure along with canceling the Airtrain might just be a way to get this to happen. Yes, I believe in magic.<br /><br />&nbsp; Also talked about for some time, is opening the schools to multiple activities after school hours, weekends, summer for other uses. The current kookaberry system is so crazy where it has to go through the maintenance staff and they are not easy to deal with! Many suburban school systems do this often and the community gets a twofer with its educational buildings. Why not here? There are some things happening but the community at large is not always aware of the offerings.

				^what&#039;s illegal about the current set up of most vendors?

				My feeling about politics is that the USA always hovers around the center. Not far right, nor far left.<br /><br />And if it veers in one direction it reverses course towards the other...kinda like a pendulum around the center.<br /><br />And I think that&#039;s ok.<br /><br />Historically, other nations have veered too much in one direction and it&#039;s turned out equally bad...whether left or right. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s interesting to me that one of the tenets of meta-modernism, which is still a developing philosophy, has turned up on Jackson Heights Life. As far as the sex workers are concerned, I am personally fine with people making a living in that way if it is right for them, provided that they are able to set their own terms. I don&#039;t get the impression that that is the case here considering the goons that hang out on 79th and Roosevelt, and the fact that human trafficking and sex slavery is a known problem in Jackson Heights (not to mention Flushing):<br /><br />https://qns.com/2019/04/jackson-heights-spa-manager-busted-for-sex-trafficking-ordered-worker-to-give-happy-endings-to-clients-da/<br /><br />https://pix11.com/news/morning/victim-highlights-perils-of-nyc-sex-trafficking/<br /><br />https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/jose-peralta/roosevelt-avenue-epicenter-nyc-sex-trafficking-officials-say<br /><br />To call what happens around here &quot;sex work&quot; is simply not acknowledging that a lot of these women are doing it against their will, or at the very least, that they are not receiving their fare share of their labor.

No matter your opinion on whether or not sex work should be legal, this really isn&#039;t a difficult concept to understand.

The push to legalize sex work is myopic.<br />And is somehow bizarrely and incorrectly mixed up with immigrant rights.<br /><br />My observation of sex work is that initially possibly it may be a way of making a living. Possibly.<br /><br />But that choice of life is so corrosive to the person that pretty soon the sex worker begins to rely on legal and illicit drugs in order to cope with the lifestyle.<br /><br />And before long the sex worker finds themself trapped working in the sex trade in order to pay for their drug habit.<br /><br />Anyone observant can see the endless file of sex workers traipsing to 79th and Roosevelt. <br /><br />I believe that&#039;s one way the &quot;goons&quot; exploit the sex workers. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Few people on 34th Avenue today, although I enjoyed my walks at 8:30 am and 1:30 - 3 pm, BUT tons of traffic backed up all over due to the parade today on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Good work DOT.

I thought open streets was basically run by volunteers, led (among others) by Jim Burke, car-owner with a cool orange work vest from Maspeth Safety, resident of the beautiful [xxxxxxxxxx], which isn&#039;t on 34th Ave. Maybe take it up with him and his &quot;coalition&quot;, and while you&#039;re at it ask why next weeks Halloween parade is going to mess everything up on 37th Ave for a second week in a row when there&#039;s a perfectly nice open street to use. <br /><br /><strong><em>[Moderators Note: publishing personal information for other people is against our forum rules.]</em></strong>

				Maybe you guys should start participating in community forums? In their presentation to the community board, DoT highlighted the consistently high foot traffic of 34 OS, the great job their partner running the program (Coalition) is doing with programming, and that DoT employees have taken over clean up, maintenance, and some of the barricade duties.
