				I&#039;ve been in contract for 6 months at 3335 81st st (and have already moved out, I have a prior thread from the winter!) and I finally am done trying to plead with the board to approve my sale. People only want to pay 150K for my condition apt, and they won&#039;t approve it unless I sell for 180K (which is the same floor price they gave my better-conditioned upstairs neighbor).<br /><br />My apartment is in old condition all around, 70s kitchen and bathroom, caked on baseboards all around, etc<br /><br />I was wondering what kind of advice I could get on renovations. If I went to a really affordable but savvy contractor and said I only had 20K to work with, would that be enough to raise my value? I would imagine the things included they would have to do is replace tiles/floors bathroom hardware, refinish the tub, replace cabinets and floors in the kitchen (MAYBE one new appliance like stove) and then replace the baseboards and refinish hardware.<br /><br />I renovated less than that in Manhattan in my new apartment for 30K so I&#039;m worried I won&#039;t get far here in Queens, but for my Manhattan apt that required some demo and a full skim-coat (which is super expensive, my new apt could use that but I can&#039;t even go there). But really I would be living paycheck to paycheck if I went any higher!

				I don&#039;t really know the answer to your question, but you could try sending a Personal Message (PM) to the member here called NYC Native. http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?action=profile;u=450&nbsp; He has done many renovations of sponsor units to get them ready for sale.

				The most that buyer was willing to do was a sellers concession which maxed out at 6%. Any other deal that artificially inflated price they were not comfortable with from either a legal or from a mortgage payment perspective. We were talking about a ~40K difference in what was offered vs what the board thought it was worth.<br /><br />The board actually changed its mind after I posted this, but it was too late. They completely freaked out those buyers and their rejection was in writing, thus providing them an out of their deposit/contract :(<br /><br />I&#039;m putting it back on the market while I look for a contractor and pursuing all angles. <br /><br />

				Hi Breakdown<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry about all of the drama...1st thing to do is take it off the market and do a bit of sprucing up - keep your agent but ask him / her to pull it off MLS and Trulia etc for a couple of weeks while u get it right.&nbsp; You then place it back on the market with new photos etc etc.<br /><br />Send me some pictures of the unit, Ill give you some free advise if you would welcome it.&nbsp; You might be able to get a lot more money if you so some simple things to the bathroom and kitchen.&nbsp; Have you painted it and staged it?&nbsp; Its not a lot of money if you think about your return..&nbsp; Lighting is really important and so is staging!<br /><br />The board is just being careful about bringing down the value of the other apartments - so while their actions are hurting your sale they are in fact helping you and the other shareholders.&nbsp; 40k represents about 22% of 180k so that&#039;s a big drop...I am certain that you can probably get another 20 to 25k with a 6k to 8k investment on your end.&nbsp; If a bank is involved then you get another 6% on a concession so you are closer to the previous sale price and if you get a cash buyer than you can do a full concession for renovations matching the previous higher sale.&nbsp; On a final note, You and your agent should have been aware of the latest sales sheet before accepting this offer - an experience Coop Broker would have advised against accepting it since the price would have red flagged the Board and management.<br /><br />I have served on Boards and still serve on committees myself...including an admissions committee .&nbsp; &nbsp;While I understand your frustration and believe me, I have been in your shoes myself, as a Board member, I couldn&#039;t justify accepting a sale that would represent a 20% decrease from a previous comparable sale.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
