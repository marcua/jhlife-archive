					Re potential alterantives to Elmhurst emergency room:&nbsp; there is a medical clinic on the north side of Queens Blvd. about a block or two east of Broadway (right before Georgia Diner and Target) which is open for walk-in patients fairly late at night (around 11PM or so) and all day weekends. Have been there several times myself as have friends;&nbsp; have never waited more than 30 minutes or so and the care is OK (good enough for relatively straightforward things).&nbsp; <br /><br />They accept HIP and possibly other insurance.&nbsp; Even without insurance, I think the cost is relatively reasonable, at least compared to a hospital emergency room (an out of town friend went there a couple years back after a minor accident; cost for exam and tetanus shot was around $125 if I recall right).&nbsp; &nbsp;

					I too think that Krispierâ€™s comments are a bit over-generalized.&nbsp; I moved here (after about 20 years in Manhattan) in the late 90s because I liked the neighborhood pretty much just as it was â€“ and I still love it today (expect to be here for a long time to come).&nbsp; Probably many if not most people who move here from elsewhere in the city feel the same way.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think itâ€™s true that there are a few people with an over-idealized concept of the â€œhistoric districtâ€ and the kinds of buildings, stores (and people) which should or should not be in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, My understanding of Jackson Heights history is that the era when it was a super-exclusive, highly planned enclave was a long, long time ago â€“ pretty much limited to the 1920s and came to an end with the depression.&nbsp; At that time, the original architectural scheme was pretty much abandoned (i.e. no more tennis courts, golf courses, open spaces at the&nbsp; ends of blocks) and the neighborhood became much denser and culturally diverse.&nbsp; Someone with a better knowledge of local history please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong about this..&nbsp; <br /><br />The best legacy of the teens and the 20s are the wonderful buildings which remain from that period â€“ which of course are well worth preserving (there are some great buildings from the 30s too).&nbsp; <br /><br />Jackson Heights will inevitably change â€“ NY is an evanescent city â€“ but hopefully however the changes happen, it will retain its current cultural vitality and (relatively speaking) affordability for people of all economic and cultural backgrounds.&nbsp; <br />

					We are lucky that a lot of cabs are available around the subway station pretty much around the clock â€“ and I totally agree that if someone is coming out of a bar at 3AM completely blitzed, spending a few bucks for a cab is the best option â€“ <br /><br />My guess is that most of the people who come home late (including all the people who work late or people who are coming home from concerts, ball games etc.) are sober (or more or less sober) and can and do make it home on foot OK without being an obvious target for someone with criminal intent.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If this incident encourages people to demand a greater police presence, good security cameras in all building lobbies and other effective crime fighting tools, then something good will have come from it.&nbsp; On the other hand, if it discourages people from going out at night because they feel the streets are somehow becoming too dangerous (and that if you canâ€™t afford a cab you have to stay at home) then that would be a really bad outcome -- and could create a situation that would ultimately lead to more not less crimeâ€¦ <br />

					Needless to say, basic crime-fighting precautions&nbsp; -- i.e. donâ€™t let anyone you donâ€™t know in the building, donâ€™t give out your SS number -- are important.&nbsp; <br /><br />But is simply deciding to walk home after midnight instead of taking a cab really such a reckless decision?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The implication of this argument seems to be that if you cannot afford to take a cab you should just stay home, because the risks of walking the streets at night are far too great.&nbsp; First of all, I do not believe this is really true about Jackson Heights, at least at the moment, despite this really bad incident.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I also think that an atmosphere of fear and paranoia â€“ where only the â€œstreet smartâ€ survive â€“ ultimately leads to more crime not less crime, insofar as people become fearful about going out, bars, restaurants and theatres shut down and formerly vibrant neighborhoods potentially turn into scary places.<br /><br />(It is also truly unfair to speculate about everything the victim of this crime did â€œwrongâ€ â€“ even assuming he did let his guard down a little bit, and there is no evidence at the moment that this is what actually happened,&nbsp; is there anyone who is 100% aware of his or her surroundings every minute?&nbsp; Really, this could happen to anyoneâ€¦.)<br />

					I understand the importance of being prudent, but -- <br /><br />This can potentially lead to a vicious circle where the fear of crime prevents people from walking home or going out in the evening, which in turn leads to less people on the streets, which then leads to more crime, which in turn creates more fear and reduces the number of people on the street still further.&nbsp; <br /><br />In an urban neighborhood like Jackson Heights (or NYC as a whole) I do not think that being able to walk home from a bar or restaurant after midnight should ever be a â€œfantasy islandâ€ expectation --&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					If the developer was seeking a zoning waiver in order to construct a 40 storey condominium tower (or even a 10 or 15 storey tower) then there would be a very good reason to be concerned about adverse impact on the neighborhood â€“ <br /><br />But a six storey building with a commercial ground floor and five floors of apartments is consistent with numerous other buildings along 37th Avenue (which is, after all, the main commercial street in Jackson Heights ) and would presumably be no higher than the 1930s apartment building just across the street, which Iâ€™ve always thought looked quite elegant and imposing (in a good way).&nbsp; &nbsp;Assuming a half-way decent design for the new structure, the proposed building would seem to be a reasonably good use of this space and might prove to be an aesthetic enhancement over just another taxpayer (which to me always look kind of provisional and ordinary).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					I like this idea with one caveat:&nbsp; <br /><br />Medallion concept seems a little problematic â€“ what seems to have happened with yellow cabs is that existing medallions are bought and sold at extremely high prices (hundreds of thousands of dollars I believe) which I understand is mostly attributable to strict limits on medallion supply imposed by TLC.&nbsp; This in turn creates high entry barriers for anyone looking to enter this business â€“ <br /><br />Think that for non-Manhattan cabs, TLC could and should establish some basic safety and environmental protocols â€“&nbsp; including exams, inspections for drivers, vehicles etc â€“ and issue licenses, which would be personal and limited to the individual or company applying.&nbsp; If TLC wanted to limit the number of drivers or cabs for traffic or environmental reasons, it could simply limit the number of licenses issued with no need for medallions. (Although I donâ€™t necessarily think itâ€™s a good idea to limit the number of cabs â€“ in an essentially urban area like Jackson Heights, maybe limiting private cars is a better way to goâ€¦.) <br />

					One potential solution for the City/TLC â€“ which I believe has been floated in the past â€“ is to maintain the existing yellow cab/medallion rules for Manhattan below 96th Street (in which the number of medallions issued is strictly limited) but open up the market to livery cabs in all of the other boroughs.&nbsp; <br /><br />The TLC could then introduce licensing/regulatory requirements for operation of cabs outside of Manhattan â€“ thereby providing basic regulatory oversight -- but not limit the number of medallions, as is currently the case with yellow cabs.&nbsp; Presumably cab service in Jackson Heights and like neighborhoods would then be (i) legal and subject to regulatory oversight by the TLC; and (ii) more or less at the level the market demands.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This would not seem to meaningfully dilute the value of yellow cab driver medallions given that yellow cabs ovewhelmingly focus their efforts on Manhattan anyway, save for trips out to the airports.&nbsp; And existing cab service in Jackson Heights and similar neighborhoods would be maintained but regularized, which maybe would curb some of the problems people have expressed concern about --&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					Purely from my own experience, in ten plus years in Jackson Heights I can say that Iâ€™ve taken livery cabs on many occasions and have never had a memorably bad experience.&nbsp; Some drivers are better than others, some more courteous than others but everyone is basically OK (I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to call them â€œshadyâ€)<br /><br />It seems pretty clear to me that, whatever the objections to livery cabs, there is a meaningful need for cab service in Jackson Heights â€“ otherwise the livery cab drivers would not be here in the numbers they are.&nbsp; In particular, people who cannot afford cars or who choose not to drive appreciate having this service available for occcasions when walking or public transport is not feasible -- <br /><br />Actually, although I might be biased as a non-driver myself, I think that one of the main reasons our streets are so congested is not livery cab drivers, but the fact that far too many people use private cars.&nbsp; Cabs would also seem to be more environmentally friendly than cars given that most of us use cabs selectively whereas people who own cars tend to use them routinely...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					Just wanted to note that for some of us, the livery cab drivers provide a very useful service in a neighborhood that is generally under-served by yellow cabs.&nbsp; I live about 15 minutes walking distance from the 74th Street station (the bus seems to take even longer) â€“ which is usually not a big deal.&nbsp; But late at night or when if Iâ€™m carrying a lot of packages, the ready availability of the livery cabs is a tremendous convenience.&nbsp; Generally find drivers to be friendly/courteous â€“ no better or worse than yellow cab drivers.
