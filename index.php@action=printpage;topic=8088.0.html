				Rather than take down the signs, they should actually enforce what it says. The city could make thousands of dollars each day in Jackson Heights alone.

				i tried suggesting enforcement from about &#039;97 through 2000. <br /><br />several cops openly laughed at me both on the phone and standing in front of me. the latter group invariably rolled their eyes as well.<br /><br />i got the same response from our council member and one of her staffers, and a very patronizing letter telling me that cops from the 115th &quot;constantly&quot; wrote tickets for honking.<br /><br />you know, like the fines for dog poop -- which bring millions into the coffers every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				Why anyone would view the removal of these signs as a victory is incomprehensible. Ask most drivers and they&#039;ll tell you that they actually are a deterrent. Good to know that DOT is officially shirking their responsibility to address such an irrelevant &#039;quality of life&#039; issue so they can focus on more important stuff like bike lanes.

				how long have you lived in new york, Flea?<br /><br />and how many times have you walked down 73rd or 75th in jackson hts -- both laden with these signs -- without horns honking? if even one percent of them could be prevented from honking by a sign, i&#039;d advocate hanging six foot high ones from every light pole.<br /><br />but let&#039;s try to be realistic. they don&#039;t work, any more than the &#039;scoop the poop&#039; ones do.<br /><br />and your antipathy towards bike lanes? try to move forward into the &#039;90s, ok? we need real alternatives to car commuting, particularly in a place like nyc, where using a car is impractical, slow, unhealthy to the environment, expensive and well, silly.

				The family across the street from me would have the bus honk their horn twice a day, everyday, once in the morning, than again in the afternoon to alert the parents that the bus was here for their kid. I&#039;d call 311 every time for about two weeks. I couldn&#039;t believe it when I saw undercover cops actually wait for the bus, than ticket the driver. Never happened again.
