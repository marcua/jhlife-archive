				If you own a dog and don&#039;t pick up its poo, please start doing so as part of your spring cleaning campaign.

				I agree. It was especially bad during the snow. I guess I was trying to piggy back on the earlier spring cleaning thread!! There&#039;s enough of a garbage problem in the neighborhood without dealing with basic lack of consideration. Can&#039;t wait until my toddler wants to investigate the steaming mounds of poo that seem to be on every block! <br /><br />Actually my nanny also lives in the neighborhood and has three dogs. She goes around her block picking up the poo from other dogs so that her neighbors don&#039;t think it&#039;s her.&nbsp; <br /><br />I notice there are doggy bag disposal stations intermittently on Roosevelt Island. Would be great if we could get them out here. Maybe building owners could subsidize them.

				I would like to think free baggies would help but I think the neighborhood needs to help too, I have gently confronted people after watching them not clean up after there dog. While it is uncomfortable it was worth it as they picked up their nasty crap!!!

				I have two dogs and while it is not the most pleasant thing to do-I do it.. Who wants to step in that? or smell it? ick!!! I&#039;ve seen people let their dogs do it on others lawns/property. They don&#039;t care.

				Hey I do pick up after my pooch always, and I also loath those that don&#039;t do it because it gives dog owners a bad name. I think the biggest issue is lack of enforcement of the laws. If a police officer sees someone not pick up, they need to issue a ticket right then and there.<br /><br />BUT I have to point out that my Co-Op has an interior garden, and they do not allow dogs to be in the garden at all. So bringing dogs into the interior gardens is really not an option for me and I imagine most JH dog owners. I&#039;m sure you are being sarcastic, but I didn&#039;t want people thinking that dog owners SHOULD use the interior garden instead of walking the dog on the sidewalk.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4404.msg29201.html#msg29201">Quote from: amadan on March 27, 2010, 04:06:25 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you own a dog and don&#039;t pick up its poo, please start doing so as part of your spring cleaning campaign.
