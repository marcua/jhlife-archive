				I don&#039;t have vision coverage. <br /><br />I had been getting my contact lenses from Coco&#039;s on 37th Avenue.<br /><br />It used to be that I could get lenses outside of the one year re-examination requirement. Coco&#039;s&nbsp; current owner/management is adhering to the once-a-year requirement. Does anyone know of an optical store that may be less strict in this regard? <br /><br />Doesn&#039;t have to be local.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have a recommendation for an eyecare specialist who will skirt the one year exam requirement (I haven&#039;t found one at least), but in case it&#039;s of interest, I recently came across this article about a new contact lens company that&#039;s trying to set up a direct sales model in order to cut prices. here&#039;s the article: http://www.gq.com/story/hubble-contact-lenses<br />I believe there&#039;s a link to the lense site in their. note- I definitely haven&#039;t tried these lenses so i can&#039;t vouch for them!

				I usually buy my contacts online. I was using VisionDirect, but they were purchased by Walgreens. What I used to do was mark my calendar to know exactly what date my prescription was expiring, and then if my eyesight seemed ok just before that date, I would buy another 6 months or a year&#039;s worth of contacts prior to the prescription expiring in order to avoid having to go in for another exam right away. That won&#039;t help in this case since yours is already expired, but if you end up going for an exam, perhaps you could use that method to help you extend the time next time around.<br /><br />I just joined Costco so will probably be getting my exam and purchasing my contacts there next time.

The doctor only comes in on certain days, so I would call to check which ones. They will provide you with a written prescription after the exam. Then, I would purchase my contacts from VisionDirect, which was recently taken over by Walgreens. I just visited the Walgreens website and they still carry the lens in my prescription - rarer toric ones - at a similar price, so I will probably continue with them in the future. Finally, just before the 1-year expiration date, I&#039;d order another year&#039;s worth of lens.
