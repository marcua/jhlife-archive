				Don&#039;t know if this has already been posted about, but there&#039;s a tasty new pizza joint on Northern around 84th.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Pagliaccio Pizza, and I&#039;ve ordered from there several times already -- fast delivery, good prices, and pizza that is definitely a cut above anything else available in the neighborhood.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have a website, but search for them on Facebook -- they have their menu posted there.&nbsp; Cash only, unfortunately.&nbsp; Worth a shot if you are in the mood for good pizza!

				well, I do not know Louie&#039;s, which I see is in Elmhurst, Pagliaccio is much closer to me, my husband and I think it&#039;s special, and he is Brazilian, which has exceptional pizza.&nbsp; Pagliaccio is different from any gourmet style pizzza I&#039;ve tried around NYC, try it.

				Restaurateur Brings Gourmet Pizza From Manhattan to Queens &nbsp;(http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121221/jackson-heights/restaurateur-brings-gourmet-pizza-from-manhattan-queens)<br /><strong><br />Article excerpts below. &nbsp;To see the whole thing, click the link.</strong><br /><br />EAST ELMHURST â€” Some immigrants are lured to the United States by the promise of achieving the American Dream. For RaÃºl Bonetto, all it took was a copy of the movie &quot;Wall Street.&quot; As a young man living in Argentina, Bonetto had no interest in living a Gordon Gekko lifestyle. He was more interested in the film&#039;s setting: New York City&#039;s bright lights drew him in, and he credits the film as the reason he moved to the U.S.<br /><br />&quot;When I saw the city on the big screen, I said, &#039;What are you doing here?&#039;&quot; Bonetto, who was 22 years old at the time, recalled. &quot;&#039;I should be there!&#039;&quot;<br />By 2008, Bonetto lived in an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and was a successful restaurateur who had owned seven restaurants in the city since moving to the U.S. in the late 1980s...<br /><br />Now back in the U.S. and living in Astoria, Bonetto has ditched the bright lights of Manhattan, reentering the world of restaurant ownership in a residential Queens neighborhood.<br /><br />Pagliaccio, a new gourmet pizzeria at 84-15 Northern Boulevard on the Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst border, is a far cry from his previous restaurants on the Upper West Side. &quot;The space is bigger, and the rent is cheaper,&quot; Bonetto said. &quot;In Manhattan, in a good location, you need to spend a lot of money.&quot;<br />But Bonetto is no stranger to the area. As the owner of a string of Latin American restaurants in the 1990s and early 2000s, he often bought his ingredients from local shops like DespaÃ±a Foods, a restaurant and grocery specializing in Latin foods at 86-17 Northern Boulevard...<br /><br />But the restaurant&#039;s signature pie is the Circo, Bonetto said. It&#039;s a thin-crust pie with sliced pepperoni, sausage, pancetta, green peppers and onions, served on a special tray created by Bonetto that holds three sauces: a red pepper sauce, a parsley and basil sauce and a spicy green tomatillo and jalapeno sauce.<br />Bonetto is perhaps best known for his empanadas. The former owner of restaurants Pampa and Gauchas, he has been featured making empanadas on Good Morning America and the Food Network. Spinach, beef, chicken and ham and cheese empanadas are all on proud display at Pagliaccio.<br /><br />The name Pagliaccio means &quot;clown&quot; in Italian, and is inspired by the opera Pagliacci. The title fits the theme of his previous two pizzerias, Traviata and Rigoletto, both named after operas and located near Lincoln Center. &nbsp;In the future, he plans to design a back patio similar to an Italian plaza, complete with cafe tables and a fountain. But for now, Bonetto, who went from a bustling metropolis to a residential neighborhood, has a modest goal: to run a small, successful business.<br />&quot;Not a big restaurant,&quot; Bonetto said. &quot;Just a pizzeria.&quot;<br /><br />(http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/12/raul-bonetto-13560404564311.JPG/image160x120.jpg)<br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121221/jackson-heights/restaurateur-brings-gourmet-pizza-from-manhattan-queens#ixzz2FhoKmx4x

				I had lunch at Pagliaccio today and it was delicious! My husband and I had to personal pies. I really recommend it. We had DespaÃ±a and the other pie divided into two, half milongo and half Napolitana. These were all great!! Great addition to the neighborhood!!

				So I heard some negative things about this place and wanted to try it first hand. I went today and had a pizza margarita. I thought the sauce was very good and the mozzarella tasted fresh. I wanted something simple to start with and was very happy. The place is really nice with a farmer&#039;s table and outdoor space. I rather liked it and will report back on my next order. Consistency is key. Most of all it appeared blessedly clean and wasn&#039;t another CHICKEN place.

				I gave them a try via delivery last week and was disappointed. I got the Primavera with Broccoli, Mushroom, Black Olives, Green Peppers and Onions. The pizza was very soggy, but I don&#039;t think it was undercooked. I think it was a combination of extra moisture in the vegetable toppings and the crust being stretched too thin. The ingredients did seem high quality and delivery was super fast, though. I might give them one more try with something simple like pepperoni.

				I was at Pagliaccio today and I think the service was good, but the pizza was okay..I personally think they need to pay more attention to high quality ingredient and make the pizza think crust and should not be undercooked.&nbsp; I hope the owner of&nbsp; Pagliaccio reads this message.&nbsp; Guys I would recommend Fornino Pizza located in Bedford Ave trust me its better than Patsy&#039;s...I might give them a try after 3 months or so.........good luck.

				Stopped by Pagliaccio tonight and was pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; I ordered a Margherita pie topped with spinach and chicken.&nbsp; The crust was cooked just right... thin crust with nice texture and crispness.&nbsp; Also a plus, the staff was very pleasant and attentive, and the dining room is tastefully designed.&nbsp; Looking forward to enjoying the outdoor space once the weather warms up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here are a few pics I took to share:<br /><br />(http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d107/Raespix/photo83_zps5204a178.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d107/Raespix/photo81_zps5d297d65.jpg)<br /><br />(http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d107/Raespix/photo84_zps17cdbcba.jpg)

				Ok, so based on the overall positive reviews of this place, I just had to go.&nbsp; <br /><br />Aesthetically, the place looks good.&nbsp; It brings back memories of when I used to love Pio Pio in its old cozy location, when I felt it had more heart.&nbsp; <br /><br />My wife and I decided to stick with the traditional and ordered their basic Mozzarella pizza and a chicken cutlet parmesan with spaghetti entree.&nbsp; First we started with a caesar salad.&nbsp; Unlike most places, it came out lightly dressed, which was refreshing.&nbsp; They advertise they make their own caesar dressing.&nbsp; <br /><br />The chicken parm came out about 25 minutes after ordering.&nbsp; A little long, but we weren&#039;t in a hurry.&nbsp; We both found the chicken and the spaghetti to be tasty.&nbsp; Strangely though, the parm came out as a cutlet with cheese, and no tomato sauce!&nbsp; Luckily, there was a ton of sauce on the pasta, so we were able to make do.&nbsp; Overall, a tasty dish.<br /><br />About 10 minutes later came the pizza.&nbsp; I do love getting pizza on trays, which gives it a gourmet touch.&nbsp; At first glance my wife says,&nbsp; &quot;Wow, oily...&quot;&nbsp; Truth be told the balance was a bit off.&nbsp; The pizza was smothered with cheese, and a bit light on sauce.&nbsp; When I grabbed my first slice, I got doused in oil on my clothes.&nbsp; Should&#039;ve blotted the pizza first I guess, but I hate to do that.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as taste, the crust was awesome.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some reviews saying the crust was underdone, but we found it to be perfect.&nbsp; Next time I&#039;m going to ask for easy on the cheese, heavier on the sauce, and I think the pie would&#039;ve been great.&nbsp; My wife didn&#039;t mind the greasiness so much, but then again didn&#039;t get it on her pants and shirt.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping the greasiness of the pie was a result of them needing to get the kinks out.&nbsp; Does strike me as a bit of a rookie mistake, however.&nbsp; I will be giving them another shot (or two), and hope they stay around!<br /><br />As for now, in my mind Louies still wears the crown for best regular and grandma pizza.&nbsp; Newcomer Mr. Bruno&#039;s wins for best sicilian, and as far as really good gourmet pizza I still have to trek to Forest Hills for Nicks.&nbsp; I&#039;m gonna keep my fingers crossed that Pagliaccio will work out their newbie issues and round out Jax Heights emerging great pizza options.&nbsp;

				when I went to chicago, I was all purist and ordered the pies plain. Simple, pure. BUT, I later realized that I was being an arrogant know-it-all when I realized that everyone gets the pies loaded with sausage, meatball and whatever. Later, I realized that deep dish is not the only style at all in chicago at all and now I need to go back. <br /><br />I&#039;m saying.... maybe you should get toppings next time? I haven&#039;t been but look forward to it. Along with Mr. Bruno&#039;s (which miiiiight be related to a Mr Bruno&#039;s in Jersey).

				Mr. Bruno&#039;s is definitely related to the Jersey folks: Their delivery boxes are emblazoned with notes about the awards won by the Jersey operation.<br /><br />we&#039;ve ordered twice from there&nbsp; -- sicilian pies, their specialty -- and had the same so-so experience both times. tasty sauce, and a lot of it, sort of old-school in that the sauce is on top of the cheese (which is also good). but the crust was way undercooked and &#039;wet&#039; both times, making the inner half of each slice kind of unappetizing.

				On the whole Jeff I agree with you.&nbsp; When I go to Chicago, I let the locals order for me and was not disappointed.&nbsp; On the whole however I don&#039;t go crazy with toppings on my pizza.&nbsp; Chicago aside, a pizza joint should be able to combine sauce, cheese and dough well enough to stand on their own.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been to a place featuring gourmet pizza that has not been able to do that.&nbsp; As a side note, after our pie came out I saw the chef run downstairs to get more sauce.&nbsp; Maybe this is why there was so little on the pie and none on the parm.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping next time they get it right, and I just caught them with an off pie.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as Brunos, I&#039;ve ordered there sicilian four times.&nbsp; Once I got it as above described.....soggy and unappetizing, but the other four times it was great.&nbsp;

				New to the neighborhood, Cute place with outdoor space I suppose for the summer. Just tried this place, was pretty good actually..Fresh pie, thin crust. We had the Margherita and a Pepperoni. It would be nice if they served ( there are no alcoholic beverages). I am going to try Louie&#039;s since I&#039;ve read so much about it although I am closer to Gianni&#039;s

				Welcome to the neighborhood! <br /><br />I highly recommend Louie&#039;s and not just for their pizza. But since we are on the topic of pizza, try their Grandma - one the best I&#039;ve had. Also a huge fan of their salmon dish (only $12!) and they have many other great specialties at an affordable price as well. <br /><br />Figured that since you&#039;re new to the area that I&#039;ll give you some other suggestions (although not all in Jackson Heights proper). Elmhurst is incredible for affordable authentic grub, particularly of the Southeast Asian variety. <br /><br />Ayada on Woodside Avenue in Elmhurst is excellent (Thai)<br /><br />Mie Jakarta on Whitney Ave in Elmhurst&nbsp; (Indonesian)<br /><br />Phayul on 37 Rd, just off 74th St (Tibetan) <br /><br />Urubamba on 37 Ave &amp; 87 St (Peruvian)<br /><br />La Casa del Pollo Peruano on Roosevelt &amp; 81 St and another location on Roosevelt &amp; 87 St (Peruvian roast chicken - personally has surpassed Pio Pio and is one of the best values in the area)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Went back to try their margherita pizza.&nbsp; Pretty darn awesome, I must say.&nbsp; Waaayyy less greasy than the regular pizza we had the first time.&nbsp; We loved it.&nbsp; Three dollars more than the regular, but well worth it.&nbsp; Also, once again I&#039;d like to mention we had the caesar salad.&nbsp; Best in the nabe, nice original tasting dressing.<br /><br />I also want to say that this is the 2nd time we&#039;ve been and there has been nobody else there when we were eating our meal.&nbsp; If you are in the mood for a good pizza support their business so they stay around!<br /><br />

				We definitely have to try this place out soon. Mr. Bruno&#039;s is ok. Their slices are small and the older man working there has a major attitude problem!! Gianni&#039;s is not the same. The people&nbsp; there are so sweet but today my kiddos picked me up a slice and it was disgusting. Hard, cold and stale tasting!! Louies is too&nbsp; far for delivery.&nbsp; I am seriously thinking of opening my own pizza joint.. Also wanted to mention Thomas pizza is selling the business&nbsp; again..

				I sometimes wonder if people aren&#039;t being &quot;too&quot; critical. I ordered from here several times and every time was better then the next. Much better than any other pizza place in Jackson Heights for sure. I hope people patronize them over the mediocrity that exist.

				<br />&nbsp;Petster, completely agree with you, this place is excellent, and should not be compared to an average pizza joint.<br />This is not your typical pizza, frankly I am a bit bored with average pizza. I also encourage people to try their empanadas. I also am thankful that the owner made a nice effort in the design of the place, not looking like a pizza place. Argentinians are known for their attention to detail.

				As a little side note, my wife and I were looking at Pagliccio to throw a party this spring. We liked the idea of having an outdoor space and using their big table and maybe was hoping they would let us bring some beer or wine.&nbsp; We called once and left our number for the owner and never heard back.&nbsp; Then we called again and the person I believed was the owner said he would call us right back, and never did. Then we stopped by to have lunch and left our number again with a gentleman who was working there who remembered we had tried calling a few days before.&nbsp; Still never heard back, so we decided to move on to another place.&nbsp; Strange right? You think that a restaurant would love the idea of having 30 people are so customers bringing hundreds of dollars worth of business.

				I&#039;m thinking maybe they don&#039;t have the staffing for it.&nbsp; But who knows, I&#039;ll still go there for the awesome Margarita pie.&nbsp; FYI, the price on the Margarita went up from 16 to 17 smackers.&nbsp; Still worth it.

				<br />Looks like they have closed, sad to see them go.....:( <br />I really liked their pizza. although I was a bit curious, as I ordered a pizza to be delivered a few weeks ago, and they sent me the wrong pizza, and they would not come back with my correct order :(&nbsp; If they do come back, I hope they improve the customer service.

				If they were treating other customers the same way, it&#039;s no surprise that they&#039;ve closed.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t tolerate that from a restaurant.&nbsp; If they refuse to deliver what you ordered, you shouldn&#039;t be charged for it.&nbsp; I hope they at least refunded your order.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7984.msg50745.html#msg50745">Quote from: Di_11372 on September 21, 2013, 01:04:33 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Looks like they have closed, sad to see them go.....:( <br />I really liked their pizza. although I was a bit curious, as I ordered a pizza to be delivered a few weeks ago, and they sent me the wrong pizza, and they would not come back with my correct order :(&nbsp; If they do come back, I hope they improve the customer service.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I ordered from them twice and the pizza was soggy both times. A lot of folks raved about it, maybe it was better fresh out the oven.

				Unfortunately im not surprised it closed.&nbsp; Last time i went it was a disaster service wise.&nbsp; Not to mention we ordered a selection of pizzas and while we waited an hour for the pizza they brought over to us pork and beef taco meats to try out.&nbsp; Very strange, guess they were failing as pizza and wanted to add more of a latin flavor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ultimately sad to see them go.&nbsp; However flawed they could produce a good, unique pie.&nbsp; Over the past year, we&#039;ve lost alchemy and pagliccio, which in my mind were two of the most interesting developments eating-wise in our hood in years.&nbsp; A shame.

				<br />I agree with you Ptbass. And It also seems that anything a little unique has a hard time surviving on Northern Blvd, which is unfortunate.
