			Anybody here used to drink in The Golden Note? It was a classic bar on the corner of 75th Street and 37th Ave.

			There was a roller skating rink on the north side of Roosevelt Ave. at around 70th street right next to the BQE.&nbsp; I think there is a church or a warehouse/distribution center in that space now.<br /><br />And there used to be a hospital on 34th Avenue between 73rd and 74th Street where the school is.&nbsp; Luckily I never ended up there after any of my roller disco adventures!<br /><br />

			I had the luck to go to the hospital on 73 st. and 34 ave,(Jackson Heights hospital/Wyckoff) twice! Once I had x rays in the basement and it was like being in a bad sci/fi movie from the fifties. <br /><br />I also remember eating at the Jackson Diner on 74st. near 37th ave. The menu was half American and half Indian. So, you could have an egg salad sandwich with a side of samosa&#039;s.<br />There was a German waitress who had a heavy accent, who once corrected the way I pronounced chole puri. That was pretty funny.
