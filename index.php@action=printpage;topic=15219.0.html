				Have anyone try the new street cart around the Diversity Plaza by Chili&#039;s. Every time I come back from work, there is always a group of people getting food there.

				Lots of business going on at the Bangladesh Street Food Cart but almost no business going on at Chili&#039;s who I&#039;m certain is paying an enormous rent and will be out of business soon.&nbsp; The owners of these food carts in JH&#039;s know what they doing and I&#039;m sure are very profitable.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Went to Chili&#039;s (the new Tawa Tandoor) once. It&#039;s pretty much what you would expect from an Indian restaurant that has a very large buffet yet very little through traffic. Some stuff tasted old, reheated, some of the rice was hard, etc. I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s still open.
