					Last night, shortly <strong>after 9pm</strong>, one of their employees came into our building and rang the actual door buzzer of EVERY single apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our buzzer went off and my husband got up to investigate.&nbsp; He did not open the door, but watched through the peephole and saw this guy ringing every other buzzer on our floor, dropping menus when they didn&#039;t answer.&nbsp; I wanted to confront the guy, but my husband wasn&#039;t into that idea.&nbsp; So after this loser did our floor, he went upstairs to the rest. (We could hear the buzzers in the nearby upstairs apartments too). <br /><br />Who does this??&nbsp; <img src="https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/angry.gif" alt="&gt;&#58;&#40;" title="Angry" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Aren&#039;t the piles of menus of menus in lobbies and menus shoved under doors enough - but this place has to disturb every single resident that was home last night?&nbsp; <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t interested in going there before, am certainly going to speak up about it now.&nbsp; Who wants to order from somewhere that will harass your neighbors?&nbsp; <br /><br />Good job, Taste of Lahore!

					I know this is technically East Elmhurst, but I&#039;m just curious.<br /><br />Anyone involved in this?&nbsp; Over the last few months I&#039;ve noticed a fenced in area of one of the Landing Lights parks being used as a dog park, but over the last few <em>weeks</em>, I&#039;ve seen &quot;NO DOGS&quot; signs posted, and last weekend on Saturday the doors to the fenced in area were padlocked shut and there were more &quot;NO DOGS&quot; signs - but the following day the locks and signs were gone and there were dogs/owners inside.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are some flyers around &quot;HELP US SAVE THE 78th STREET DOG PARK&quot; with the aim to formally recognize the space as a park.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a dog, so I have no horse in this race, so to speak.&nbsp; Just wondering what the consensus is, and if there were another dog park available in the nearby neighborhood - how could that be a bad thing? <br /><br />

					I hope this is the right place for a post like this. I am seeking out ideas in getting a longstanding situation resolved.&nbsp; Namely, the swift removal of an extremely destructive and unstable neighbor.<br /><br />My BF and I moved into the fourth floor of one of the Richelieu buildings on 77th St between 35th &amp; 34th Ave in April.&nbsp; Overall we&#039;ve had a great experience. Our neighbors are super-friendly, etc.&nbsp; Except for one BIG problem.&nbsp; A mentally unstable man who lives in the apartment above us.&nbsp; This story explains the firetruck and cops at this location last night.<br /><br />A little over a month ago, we woke up and saw water all over the kitchen floor.&nbsp; It was coming from the light fixture, and making its way down the space between wall and paint on the left side.&nbsp; My bf called the super and he showed up immediately.&nbsp; He took pictures with a digital camera first so that he&#039;d have &quot;proof&quot; to show the guy upstairs why he&#039;d need to get into the apartment, because as he said, the guy is a little &#039;weird&#039;.&nbsp; While the super went up, we were able to hear part of their conversation.&nbsp; What we heard was &quot;I DIDN&quot;T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Riight.&nbsp; The super came down and said that the kitchen faucet was on full blast and the drainage pipe under the sink had been loosened.&nbsp; And that the guy claimed he didn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been waiting since then for the plaster etc. to dry out.&nbsp; Before last night it looked a mess and the Super said we&#039;d have to have the cabinets on that wall taken down so the wall could be replastered, along with part of the ceiling that would need to be replastered and all repainted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fast forward to LAST NIGHT.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I had left the kitchen/livingroom area and were in the bedroom for less than fifteen minutes and we heard a knock on the door.&nbsp; It was the neighbor in the apartment BELOW us, saying his hallway was leaking from upstairs.&nbsp; He asked if the crazy guy was leaking again.&nbsp; We had NO idea until we went into the kitchen and saw the light fixture FULL of brownish water, and more water coming from other parts of the ceiling.&nbsp; We and the guy downstairs were unsuccessful getting in touch with the super, and the situation was worsening. Water bubbling everywhere, worries of an electrical fire since the water was obviously hitting things it shouldn&#039;t in the ceiling...&nbsp; And of course, though people banged on his door, crazy man refused to answer.&nbsp; He was home, his lights were on.&nbsp; <br /><br />As a last resort, we called 911.&nbsp; A fire truck was dispatched within a few minutes.&nbsp; We and a few other neighbors were chatting in the stairwell while they were yelling to him and getting ready to break his door down.&nbsp; The neighbors were warning the firemen that the guy is crazy and violent. Many of our neighbors have lived in the building for over 25 years, like this guy, and they know his antics well.&nbsp; The firemen crowbar the door open easily, after asking him to open it for over five minutes.&nbsp; The guy starts screaming at them the following:&nbsp; &quot;GET OUT.&quot; &quot;THERE&#039;S NO FIRE&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I&#039;M NOT CRAZY&quot; &quot;I&#039;M ON MY MEDICATION&quot; &quot;GET OUT OF HERE&quot;.&nbsp; Obviously his apartment is filled with water and they go to investigate. Cops are called.&nbsp; Cops show up. They end up escorting him out to go to the mental hospital for the night.&nbsp; I was happy until all the neighbors said, it happens all the time, he&#039;ll be back tomorrow doing the same shit.&nbsp; He&#039;s been taken to court several times but he always ends up back here.&nbsp; There were also mentions of him having drug dealers climb up the fire escape to his apartment (which means going past OUR window!), pulling a knife on another tenants son, and the fact that this guys brother threw himself out of the window upstairs 12 years ago. Unsettling.<br /><br />So now we have worse water damage than before.&nbsp; The firemen had to take one of our fuses out (connected to the kitchen light, for safety) and we have no electricity in half our apartment.&nbsp; I know that Management will take care of the damage.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>HOW CAN WE PROPERLY GET THIS SITUATION RESOLVED, meaning this guy needs to be removed from the building as soon as possible.&nbsp; How much damage and havoc can someone cause before it&#039;s too much?&nbsp; 25 years the man has lived here and as per the neighbor across from him, this water thing has happened 10-15 times!</strong><br /><br />We plan on calling the building manager today (along with several other neighbors) but is there absolutely anything else we can do?<br /><br />Post back or Private Message if possible.&nbsp; Any additional questions will be answered.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for reading, I am so exhausted from last night.

					I currently *technically* live in East Elmhurst, by a half-block.&nbsp; My significant other and I will be looking for a place in Prime Jackson Heights so we can be closer to transportation.&nbsp; I would love to get into one of the pre-wars and have been doing research as much as I can, but I can&#039;t figure out which of the&nbsp; buildings rent and if they do, how to get in, and if they&#039;re pet-friendly etc.<br /><br />We can pay up to 1600-1700 for a 1BR<br />Currently almost non-smokers, but we don&#039;t smoke in the apartment anyway...<br />Couple of cats<br />Both of us are working professionals, responsible etc. etc.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />And thanks. <img src="Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
