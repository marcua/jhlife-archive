				Two menu&#039;s were place under my door, one Chinese the other Japanese both located at<br />37-09 83rd Street called Empire Chinese Restaurant and the other Empire One1Sushi.&nbsp; Considering we only have two Japanese Restaurants, Empire One1Sushi could do well if the food is good.&nbsp; I plan to visit soon and order Japanese Take Out.&nbsp;

				Let us know! I find when a place does both Chinese and Japanese, both tend to be mediocre. Hopefully, that&#039;s not the case here.

				Empire Chinese has been around for a while, they are pretty standard chinese takeout. But they are good, along with Pekking Kitchen they are my go to for chinese food cravings.

				Maybe I&#039;ll give them a try just for Chinese. I&#039;m getting a little tired of Ming Wok. <br />

				we tried the sushi last week. not terrible, but meh. the fancy roll wasn&#039;t bad but the fish in the couple pieces of nigiri was just so-so.<br /><br />the menu is almost an exact duplicate of east 21, which is also part of a Chinese/Japanese tandem. I might try cooked food next time around, but won&#039;t go back for seconds on the sushi.

				I&#039;ve gotten a couple hundred menus from East 21 Chinese and Japanese slipped under my door. Somehow, I haven&#039;t tried them yet. For Chinese, I switched a few years ago from Empire to Peking. For Japanese, I like Happy Kitchen. I&#039;m not a food critic, but I really like the atmosphere they have there. I guess I am skeptical of places that do both Chinese and Japanese. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s reasonable. The chicken at Empire always seemed a little rubbery to me, so I switched. But maybe they&#039;ve upped their game along with the addition of Japanese.

				have you tried JJ Garden for Chinese? it&#039;s one of my favorites. in the shopping center by the waldbaum&#039;s. they deliver to me, not sure quite how far they go.<br /><br />agreed on the idea of restaurants that try both Chinese and Japanese...the latter is the one that really seems to suffer.

The sushi &amp; tempura were actually ok, but the cooked food was awful. Flavorless and rubbery chicken teriyaki. That should be the standard dish in any American Japanese place.

				For Chinese food, we are lucky to be next to Elmhurst, one of four(maybe more than that by now) New York Chinatowns. Most of the restaurants deliver to Jackson Heights. For example, we often get food from Sweet Yummy, funny name, but really good and authentic setchuan food.
