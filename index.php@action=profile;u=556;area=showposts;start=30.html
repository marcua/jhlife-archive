					Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dear Community Member:<br /><br />Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) is offering a Children&#039;s Anxiety Group for children ages 6 to 10, with unwanted fears, worries, and shyness. <strong>Facing Anxiety with Courage &amp; Empowerment (FACE)</strong> creatively incorporates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, psychoeducation &amp; practice. This program is based on extensive research, with the goal of helping children learn (in a supportive and encouraging environment) to cope more effectively with anxiety. The group activities will help provide children with tools to face stressful situations more courageously. <br />&nbsp;<br />The group is expected to start January 2016 and run on Thursdays from 4:30pm – 6:00pm for 16 sessions. Interested participants will be offered a brief phone screening followed by an in person interview to ensure that your child’s needs can be best met by this group. As a community service, most of the cost will be subsidized by the college, such that the fee for participation will be $95.00 (this includes the application, group screening, child group sessions, and parenting sessions). The fee may be further reduced in the case of financial need. <strong>No one will be turned away for inability to pay.</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />For more information regarding our children&#039;s anxiety group- Facing Anxiety with Courage &amp; Empowerment (FACE), Psychological Wellness Programs, or Psychotherapy Services, please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or call 718-570-0500. Visit us at <a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC</a> Queens College Psychological Center is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-21 Main Street, Flushing, Queens. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Other Services: QCPC&#039;s mission is to bring treatment programs based on extensive research to benefit the community directly. The clinic continues to offer treatment for problems such as depression, stress, anxiety, interpersonal/relational issues, dissatisfaction with current personal or interpersonal life choices, grief and bereavement, coping with medical illness or disability, trauma, self-esteem and body image concerns, parenting issues and adjustment to changing life circumstances. For children, typical problems may include separation anxiety, school refusal, social anxiety, fears, phobias, social skills deficits, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), tantrums, aggression, depression, moodiness, impulsivity, defiance and disobedience.&nbsp; The clinic team works closely with our child clients’ schools and does school visits when necessary. Fees for these services are based on a sliding scale from zero to fifty dollars (average fee is $10) that takes into account personal and/or family income and circumstances. This community mental health service is a training and research center operated by the Ph.D. program in clinical psychology. Advanced doctoral candidates in the college’s Clinical Psychology doctoral program provide treatment to patients under the close supervision of experienced, licensed psychologists on the Queens College faculty.

					Greetings: Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information. Thank you.<br /><br />Dear Community Member: Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) is offering a <strong>Children&#039;s Social Skills Group for girls ages 6 to 10</strong>. The group is expected to start March 5, 2015 and run on Thursdays from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm for 10 sessions. This social skills program is based on extensive research, with the goal of increasing children&#039;s self-esteem &amp; social skills in a supportive environment. The group activities focus on the development of life skills such as problem solving, using appropriate social skills, making and keeping friends, and how to deal with stress and conflict.&nbsp;Interested participants will be offered a brief phone screening followed by an in person interview to ensure that your child’s needs can be best met by this group. As a community service, part of the cost will be subsidized by the college, such that the fee for participation will be $75.00 (this includes the application, group screening, child group sessions, and parenting sessions). The fee may be further reduced in the case of financial need. No one will be turned away for inability to pay.<br /><br />Also continuing is the QCPC ’s<strong> FREE&nbsp;Coping with Depression Program for Adults.</strong> (Therapist’s who speak Spanish are also available).<br /><br />Other Services:&nbsp;QCPC&#039;s mission is to bring treatment programs based on extensive research to benefit the community directly. The clinic continues to offer treatment for problems such as depression, stress, anxiety, interpersonal/relational issues, dissatisfaction with current personal or interpersonal life choices,&nbsp;&nbsp;grief and bereavement, coping with medical illness or disability, trauma, self-esteem and body image concerns, parenting issues and adjustment to changing life circumstances. For children, typical problems may include separation anxiety, school refusal, social anxiety, fears, phobias, social skills deficits, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), tantrums, aggression, depression, moodiness, impulsivity, defiance and disobedience. &nbsp;The clinic team works closely with our child clients’ schools and does school visits when necessary.Fees for these services are based on a sliding scale from zero to fifty dollars (average fee is $10), that takes into account personal and/or family income and circumstances.&nbsp;(Therapist who speak Spanish are also available).&nbsp;This community mental health service is a training and research center operated by the Ph.D. program in clinical psychology. Advanced doctoral candidates in the college’s Clinical Psychology doctoral program provide treatment to patients under the close supervision of experienced, licensed psychologists on the Queens College faculty.<br /><br />For more information regarding QCPC Psychological Wellness Programs, Girls Social Skills Group, or Psychotherapy Services,&nbsp; please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to:&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a>&nbsp; or call 718-570-0500</strong>.

					Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.&nbsp; Thank you. <br /><br />As part of their community service mission, Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) is currently offering a free Depression Treatment Program.&nbsp; Stress and Depression can drain your energy, hope, and productivity, and affect your relationships with those you love.&nbsp; If you have mild depression that isn&#039;t improving, or you have moderate depression, CBT treatment may be very helpful to you. <br /><br />Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) recognizes that past events may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It helps you understand your thoughts and behavior and how they affect you.&nbsp; A screening is required, and if appropriate for CBT, you would then be eligible to receive 8-12 individual sessions at no fee. All QCPC programs are based on extensive research, and adopt a collaborative stance that encourages you to work on changing how you feel by putting into practice what you have learned.<br /><br />For more information regarding the QCPC Depression Program, please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or call 718-570-0500.

					Free Social Anxiety Support &amp; Treatment Program at Queens College<br /><br />If you live with Social Anxiety Disorder you may be interested to know that the Queens College Psychological Center is currently offering, as part of their community service mission, a free Social Anxiety Support &amp; Treatment Program (SASTP).&nbsp; SASTP is based on extensive research, and provides a safe, comfortable, respectful and accepting environment in which to learn about the impact of social anxiety disorder through the life cycle, learn specific skills targeted to helping develop healthy relationships and connectedness, and break through social anxiety&#039;s interference with achieving goals and potential, as well as to enhance self-esteem, acceptance and well-being.&nbsp; For more information regarding the SASTP please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a>&nbsp; or call 718-570-0500.

SAD is characterized by excessive anxiety and self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with SAD have a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being judged by others and of being embarrassed or humiliated by their own actions. While recognizing that their fear of being around people is unreasonable, they cannot control the worry, and often experience low self-esteem and depression. SAD can be limited to only one type of situation (e.g. fear of speaking in formal or informal situations), or may broadly impact making or keeping relationships. Physical symptoms can accompany the intense anxiety&nbsp; (e.g. blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, and other symptoms of anxiety, including difficulty talking and nausea or other stomach discomfort.) <br /><br />Queens College Psychological Center is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, Queens.&nbsp; For more information please call at: 718-570-0500 or email at <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> Visit us at http: <a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) offers compassionate, high quality, evidence-based, psychological services for children, adolescents, and adults.
