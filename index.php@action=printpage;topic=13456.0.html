				Figured I&#039;d ask the folks on here what the &quot;protocol&quot; is for grabbing a street parking spot. Last night I was coming home and was double parked waiting for a spot. About 3 cars back someone started their car to pull out. I backed up a bit, put on my blinker (not my hazards, just my blinker), and gave the exiting car enough room to pull out. Before the other car pulled out, a third car pulled up behind the car that was pulling away; as soon as the exiting car moved out of their spot the third car zoomed into the spot and grabbed it. I was there for longer and I had my blinker on and had backed up a bit, in my mind both of these are indicators that I was about to pull into the spot. So I pulled up next to the car and asked what they were doing and why they took the spot when it was clear that I was there first and was about to park there. The passenger in the car (the driver remained silent) insisted that it was &quot;protocol&quot; that you wait immediately behind the exiting car if you are going to take their spot. He insisted that he didn&#039;t know that I was waiting for the spot and that &quot;I could be doing anything&quot; and &quot;he didn&#039;t know if I was waiting for somebody&quot; etc etc since I was up ahead. I said no, if I was just standing, loading/unloading, etc. I would have had my hazards on, not my blinker, and not in a position to take the spot. The person was incredibly rude and insisted that &quot;everyone&quot; knows that the parking &quot;protocol&quot; is that you wait behind the exiting car. <br />I&#039;ve *never* heard this supposed parking &quot;protocol&quot; and have seen people both ahead and behind of the exiting car take a spot. Often it&#039;s not possible to get behind the exiting car because of other moving vehicles, buses, etc. on the street (and it kind of doesn&#039;t make sense, since the majority of the time you&#039;re pulling in backwards to parallel park and need to be in front of the exiting car anyway).<br />So - what&#039;s the deal here? Is there some sort of unwritten rule about street parking that I don&#039;t know about? If so, why has it not been made apparent in my X number of years living in JH and parking in NYC in general? I know that you can&#039;t save a spot, etc., but when someone is within 3 cars of the exiting car and has their blinker on, to my mind, it&#039;s pretty obvious that they&#039;re waiting for the car to leave.

				Oh man... This is the Seinfeld episode. I&#039;ve been on both sides here as the person that past the car and tried to back up and also the person that took the spot from someone trying to back up. I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that once you past the car pulling out, you&#039;ve missed your chance. We all know it&#039;s a hazard to start backing up on the street in the hopes to get there before someone comes up from behind for that exact reason. Got to suck it up and admit you missed that one and move on. Hopefully you&#039;ll hit one at the right moment next time. On the other hand if you were clearly backing up in the process of parallel parking thats another story.

				The protocol is to wait behind the car that&#039;s exiting a spot. Once they pull out you move ahead and parallel park. Otherwise you&#039;re in the way, even if you&#039;re a few cars down they still have to go around you, and you also have to wait for them to get around you before being able to back up and park. It&#039;s also not clear you&#039;re taking the spot, as you ran into, though it does sound like you&#039;re situation was a judgment call if they saw you backing up.

				First of all - Thank you for bringing this up. I love street etiquette, especially with driving and parking. <br /><br /><br />So, a few points....<br /><br /><br />- It is definitely protocol that the person would back into a spot by parallel parking. If the person went head-in, that&#039;s a breach of etiquette. This was addressed in Seinfeld here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov7HFwrRFyc<br /><br /><br />- That being said, it is less a breach of etiquette to wait in front of the space. I do think about this quite a bit, and while you can still technically get into a spot going backwards down the street, I would say the the person who is facing the spot has somewhat of a right of way. In terms of proximity, a car waiting behind the car coming out is closer and safer to the spot than a car in front who will have to move ahead an extra spot, then back up at least a car length to get to the spot. This is not a total breach of etiquette in my view, but I would say the person in back has the right of park. In the case of a bus or truck coming, you just gotta bite the bullet and keep moving forward. <br />..... First priority should be the person getting out of the space safely, THEN it is the person waiting in line to make their move. <br /><br /><br />- You had your blinker on; it would make sense that you are waiting for a spot IN FRONT of you. Is the person behind you supposed to give you the right to park to every spot in front, aside, and behind you? <br /><br /><br />In conclusion, I wouldnt get too perturbed but unless the person went in headfirst, I would say they had the right to park.

				I deal with this kinda of situation about 5% of the time. Next time put your car in reverse while holding your brake and have your blinker on indicating that your going to replace the car leaving. So, at least it will show the other drivers that your reverse lights are on and that you have your blinker on. I have had the situation with you, happen to me a couple of occasions, waiting for 5-10 mins for the car to move out and then someone tries to sneak in. I usually get out screaming which creates a scene, 9/10 times the person moved because of pure principal and that they don&#039;t want to get into a fight. Parking in JH is not worth fighting over but sometimes it really gets me going...

				This JUST happened to me yesterday! I wagged my finger and said it was bad etiquette. it was in good nature though, he said he had a long day and could he please take the spot. I said okay, but dont do it again because it is bad parking etiquette and he knows it. I circled the block and got a spot as someone was coming out.
