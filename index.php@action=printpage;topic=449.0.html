				I&#039;ve noticed that internet service has been more off than on for the past 2 or 3 days.&nbsp; Pages have loaded slowly if at all.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; I was reading about an under sea fiber optic cable that was damaged in India recently by an anchor.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if this could be the cause?&nbsp; I mention this only because I&#039;ve read similar complaints on other forums during the moments that I have been able to connect to the internet.

				Do you use a combo of Earthlink and Time Warner Cable? That&#039;s my combo and they are indeed having problems. I hope they get it fixed up very soon.

				I have cable internet service from Earthlink that is provided by Time Warner. for the past few weeks or so I have had frequent periods of either sluggish internet connection, or no connection whatsoever. It usually comes back within 30-60 minutes. My question:&nbsp; has anyone else been experiencing this kind of problem? What other providers are available in the neighborhood...Verizon? I wonder if another provider has better service. This is infuriating, especially considering the rates they charge...arghh...

				thanks, michaelb - that&#039;s incredibly useful information! i am considering changing over to rr cable - i have been hesitant because it means giving up my earthlink email address, but i think i&#039;m going to bite the bullet. earthlink has definitely sunk to low depths in terms of service.

I&#039;ve had RR for years, first with aol and now Mac.&nbsp; Usually it&#039;s very fast.&nbsp; I think something is going on with Time Warner

				I too have Earthlink service through TimeWarner Cable and I must report that I have been having extensive problems in recent weeks. However, my problem is connectivity rather than speed. I seem to be losing my ISP connection intermittently (several times a week), which requires that I reboot my cable modem. Further complicating matters is the fact that I have home phone service through Earthlink as well, so this ISP disconnection also disables incoming/outgoing calls. Until I read your post, I was beginning to suspect that my cable modem was at fault but perhaps there is another explanation? (Just for reference, I live on 80th Street between 35th and 37th Avenues.)

				Tonight my service was so damn slow I decided to call Time Warner and see if they could do something.&nbsp; About one hour later and after speaking to Service levels 1, 2 AND 3, I learned that my Timer Warner service is operating at the speeds it should be.&nbsp; We ran two different Speed tests and both my upload and download numbers were close to the parameters of the service that I&#039;m supposed to have.<br /><br />The tech. guy at level 3 said for me to speak to Apple because it might be a software bug.&nbsp; When I told him that other people felt their computers were acting &#039;sluggish&#039;, he said maybe it&#039;s a virus! yikes.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m calling Apple tomorrow and will do the process again to see if I can figure this out.

				I just thought I would share this information with all TimeWarner Cable customers: I posted in this thread a few weeks back but then all the problems seemed to clear up for a few weeks... until three weekends ago when my service (phone and internet) went down for three days. I thought my cable modem to blame and TWC sent a serviceman to come replace it. He checked the line and informed me that the signal coming into our building was at a frequency that was higher than the standard operating range of the cable modem... a problem that TWC technicians had to fix from the street level. Sure enough, since then my service has been fine again. <br /><br />Slightly off-topic: Is anybody else as outraged as I am by TWC&#039;s upcoming rate increase? I&#039;m especially insulted by their latest marketing gimmick--locking down a rate for the next two years--considering that Verizon has now entered the market in NYC and could be offering FioS service by then. Or am I foolish to think that competition might actually bring rates down?&nbsp; ???

				Don&#039;t be outraged just switch to Verizon now.&nbsp; I only have basic cable now with TWC.&nbsp; And truthfully that could change in the future because I&#039;m very happy with my Verizon wireless internet service.&nbsp; Verizon kills me on the cell phone charges but the home phone and internet fees are reasonable.&nbsp; The only reason I haven&#039;t switched my tv to them is sheer laziness.
