				Last night at 11:45 PM I was sitting in front of my computer. Directly behind me on the opposite side of the room is a window to the fire escape. The window does have a fire safety gate on it, but I had it open and a small fan in the window. I heard a crash and thought the fan fell over. When I turned around the fan was lying down, the screen that was down was now up and I saw a a pair of man&#039;s arms on the fan. He was about to move it out of the way and come in! <br /><br />I did scare him with a LOUD set of expletives. Now the guy was apologizing and trying to hand me a story about not being able to get into his apartment. I did see him and he was no one that I know. And he certainly knew this isn&#039;t his apartment. The guy ran up above and disappeared.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, if he&#039;s desperate from Covid economics or if he has an expensive daily habit to support. Both of which are maybe an incentive for burglary. I should also say that the window is quite visible to the outside and in a fairly well lit up place. This may be an isolated incidence or the beginning of a neighborhood rash. Please be vigilant as well as careful!

				Other than being rattled by this experience I am fine. Who knows what would have happened if he had come all the way in. Yes he went up and disappeared and that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean to another window. I am now better prepared in a legal way. So I wouldn&#039;t recommend that he or any of his friends try it again.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Thank you r, abcdefghijk, Ms. Jackson for your support and help. I am happy to see that this thread has a lot of views. I have been living in this apartment for 28 years, been in the neighborhood since I am 5. I love JH and that is why I am here in it and on this site. The more we can share, even if we disagree at times, the better off we all are. The police are involved. I did see the creeps face and there are cams everywhere over here.

				Yeah, this is concerning, for sure! We live nearby and will be more careful about locking windows. We also have stoppers on most of our windows--they can only open a few inches unless we release the stoppers from inside. For the ones that don&#039;t have stoppers, we will keep them locked and at least we will know that if someone wants to break in they would have to break the window--and we&#039;d hear that for sure. Scary.

				Thanks dssjh! The cops pointed out the cams to me and said there are cams across the street also. Really it&#039;s not the sort of thing I pay attention to. And there is a good reason for that - I&#039;m not into mischief! Just a normal low key person here. So they see me coming and going? Who cares, I have nothing to hide. Now that I see the cams my sense of humor says look up at them and wave hi.<br /><br />I hope that it makes you feel comfortable as well to know that the cams are there.<br /><br />Thanks also ljr.<br /><br />I also want to say that I do not support defunding the police, and held that view before my incident. If there are problematic cops the system needs to be able to identify them and handle that on an individual basis. We need to have them and having less instead of more is not going to help anything at all. <br /><br /><br />

				<br />Thanks Bella &amp; Captain. <br /><br />Yes I saw his face clearly. The police are sorting through the story and the cams. One step at a time.<br />I agree a baseball bat is legal. In an ideal world it&#039;s not a weapon. I&#039;d rather take it to Travers and play with the kids. But if it means peace of mind at home then so be it.

				If they threatened you or displayed a weapon you would probably be OK.&nbsp; If not, your retaliation might be considered a disparity of force.&nbsp; It also depends&nbsp; on the city/state.&nbsp; Some places consider your home your castle and you have the right to defend it.&nbsp; In Deblasio&#039;s NY I think criminals have more rights now.

				The way I understand the law - if someone is completely physically in your place and threatens you, you can do what you need to defend yourself and home. In my case since he wasn&#039;t completely in if I had somehow harmed him I could be liable. Yes, that is what we are up against.The nebulous part is what do they call a threat? And it would be their word against mine.Weapon or no weapon shown to me their presence is a threat. They didn&#039;t just climb through the window for a cup of tea.<br /><br /><br /><br />

No questions later about whether or not you have a license to have such an item in your home. Bats also give you reach. You can use it push someone away from you (or out your window) without taking a swing at them. I&#039;ve used a bat to let someone who attempted to enter my bedroom window know I meant business. They stopped.

				^yeah, something similar happened to me in college. It&#039;s scary, I know. I&#039;m glad I had a softball bat in the apartment to grab and give me a little extra courage as I told whoever was on the porch roof trying to open my window in the middle of the night that they were in for a world of trouble.

				A burglar will usually leave without being threatened, as did the original perpetrator. A home invader may well have a gun. Don&#039;t bring a bat to a gunfight has usually been sound advice. <br />Additionally, if you actually try to use the bat, you face the chance that an unarmed person overpowers you and now is no longer unarmed. <br />Finally should you be charged with a crime you may be faced with a considerable bill for a defense lawyer. None of this is to say that you shouldn&#039;t defend yourself, but that you should consider all the implications.

				How can you make a quick, &#039;legal&#039; reaction when a stranger just invaded your space? Allow that person to join in? Good thing she was able to scare him away and that he didn&#039;t carry any weapon. Being a female is also especially vulnerable. Self defense should be a priority with physical response as the last resort.&nbsp;

				I can tell you this - you can&#039;t predict a reaction, not even your own. Things happen in split seconds with no time to intellectualize them. As soon as I realized what was happening there was an immediate flood of adrenaline. My first reaction was to stop what was happening. I was not going to be a victim. I was not going to cooperate or flee. Luckily becoming scary worked for me. Had things escalated I don&#039;t know what my adrenaline might have done. Hopefully I will never have to find out.

Just make sure you ring the doorbell. LOL <br /><br />I&#039;m told the law says that perp has to be all the way in your place and a threat before you can use the bat or pan. Otherwise you can be held liable for assault. Others have said grab the creep, drag him in and then he&#039;s yours. Your word against his. Something like pepper spray is a good way to disarm first and then clobber him if need be. That&#039;s called legally defending your home and self.

				I lived in DC during the crack years and have been mugged twice and burglarized. I ended up slashing the burglar&#039;s fingers pretty bad with a knife as he was attempting to gain entry and didn&#039;t get in a bit of trouble except that my university charged me to clean the small amount of blood off the carpet (off-campus student housing, I was in college at the time). <br /><br />Beech Court, I&#039;m glad you are ok and thank you for the warning!

				Thanks Lilybell.<br /><br />I am fine and better prepared if I should ever (hopefully not) have to face this again. I hope this thread has made others aware of all that I learned going through this experience. I&#039;m sorry you had yours. Sometimes I think that this Covid economy tempts people into things that they might not normally try. That&#039;s sad.<br /><br />As this story unfolds a clearer picture of that night is coming into focus. I&#039;m just not permitted to say things publicly till all concerned have done their part and wrapped things up. Either way it still should not have occurred and in the end I&#039;m the one that has to live with it.
