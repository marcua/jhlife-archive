Their goal is to raise $500,000 as soon as possible.<br /><br />&quot;We have a lot of people in the community who love parks and are committed to preserving open space,&quot; said City Councilman Daniel Dromm. &quot;For the advocates in the community to have collected such a large amount of money in bad economic times is incredible.&quot;<br /><br />School officials seemed open to accepting a community loan at a meeting last week attended by nearly 150 neighborhood residents, said Dromm (D-Jackson Heights). But no one from the nursery-through-12th-grade school promised the land would go to the city - even if residents raise enough money to cover the school&#039;s operating costs.<br /><br />Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s board of trustees, has said the school would prefer to sell the yard to the city to expand nearby Travers Park.<br /><br />But Garden School is in tough financial straits due to an enrollment drop. And it could take up to two years for the school to get a dime from the city due to its lengthy acquisition process.<br /><br />&quot;The community is making us into the bad guy when the city has not put up one nickel in licensing or guaranteeing that they are going to purchase the property,&quot; Rakosi said.<br /><br />The trustees rejected a $4.7 million city offer last month to buy 20,000 square feet of property. It also shot down a $4.8 million bid for 29,000 square feet that would have allowed Garden to use the yard during the school day.<br /><br />The school is now &quot;close&quot; to signing a deal with a developer for &quot;substantially&quot; more money, Rakosi said, but the trustees are still &quot;talking&quot; to the city.<br /><br />&quot;I didn&#039;t ask [the community] to raise half a million dollars,&quot; Rakosi said.<br /><br />The issue has become heated because Jackson Heights has one of the least amounts of park space per capita in the city, according to New Yorkers for Parks.<br /><br />Dudley Stewart, president of the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, which is spearheading the pledge drive, hopes the community&#039;s efforts will sway the trustees.<br /><br />But &quot;we will not ask people to honor their pledges until we&#039;re certain the school accepts the city&#039;s offer,&quot; Stewart said.<br /><br />Jacqueline Quinn, 46, of Astoria said she would consider pulling her two children out of the school if Garden sells its yard to anyone but the city. She said she hopes students can use the field during school hours.<br /><br />&quot;If the school was willing to work more with the community, I think it would build a bridge for the future success of the school,&quot; she said.</div>

Held at the Community United Methodist Church, the meeting was attended by representatives from local organizations, elected officials and nearly 80 Jackson Heights residents, most of whom were previously unaware of the proposed sale. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Garden School, an 87-year-old institution with classes from kindergarten to 12th grade, is reeling under the effects of the recession and a drop in enrollment. In March 2010, the school began talks with the city regarding the sale of its 29,000-square foot-playground at the corner of 34th Avenue and 78th Street. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The city, hoping to expand Travers Park, situated across the street from the playground, made two offers: $4.7 million for 20,000 square feet and $4.8 million for 29,000 square feet, the latter coupled with a clause allowing Garden School to continue using the playground during school hours. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œIt was an extremely generous offer, very close to the asking price of $5.2 million,â€ said Councilman Danny Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), who was involved in the negotiations and secured most of the funds for the purchase. â€œThe important thing was that the school could sell the property and continue to use it, so that the kids wouldnâ€™t lose their playground.â€ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;At a Jan. 18 board meeting, trustees of the school voted to decline the cityâ€™s offer. They are considering a private developerâ€™s offer of $5.4 million for 20,000 square feet, said Gruen, a deal which would allow the school to retain one third of the property as its playground. The main reason for rejecting the cityâ€™s offer, he said, was that it would take too long to close the deal. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;When buying property, the city must follow the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure or ULURP. For land deals, this process, which typically takes 12 to 18 months, starts with an application to the Department of City Planning followed by multiple certifications and reviews by city bodies including the community board, borough president and city Planning Commission. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œSo the question is, how do we get from here to there?â€ Gruen said at the meeting, estimating that the school was in immediate need of $500,000 to cover operating costs and remain open for the next academic year. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Both Garden School and Dromm said that they have, individually and together, made several attempts to arrange for a bridge loan, approaching private investors and the schoolâ€™s wealthy alumni and banks such as JP Morgan Chase,to help the school survive till the cityâ€™s check clears. But none of the negotiations have been successful, said Richard Marotta, principal of the school, attributing their failure to obtain a loan to high interest rates, ranging from 10 to 13 percent, and the absence of an executing contract with the city. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œThe fact is that the deal with the city adds many expenses. We have to extend our existing loans for another year or more, pay debt service costs and take a new bridge loan at a high rate of interest,â€ said Gruen. Another problem, he added, is that the deal is contingent upon whether the city has funds at the time that the ULURP process is completed 12 to 18 months later. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Community organizations, such as the Jackson Heights Beautification Group and the Jackson Heights Green Alliance, who have been in touch with the school since December of last year, say green space must be a priority in the neighborhood. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œJackson Heights and our community district is next to last in the city in the amount of green space we have,â€ said Edwin Westley, president of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group. â€œThis is a rare opportunity to expand our green footprint.â€ <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This sentiment seemed to resonate with residents at the meeting who voiced their opposition to a playground being turned into a construction site and then to a big apartment building. The area is zoned as R-7, which would allow for the construction of a seven or eight storey residential building. The school is also considering selling its air rights to developers, which would allow construction of an even taller building. The community also expressed concern about the fate of Jackson Heightsâ€™ Play Street, a space on 78th Street between Travers Park and Garden Schoolâ€™s playground, to be closed to traffic in July and August, giving children more open space to play during the summer. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In an attempt to salvage the situation, residents at the meeting made several suggestions, including: an appeal for federal funds, a wide-scale neighborhood fundraiser themed â€œDo you want to buy a park?â€ an interest-free community-based loan program and an initiative to persuade banks in the neighborhood to give back by providing funding. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œThere is a lot of energy here. Many people found out about this problem only today and really want to do something,â€ said James Cornejo, 42, who has lived in Jackson Heights all his life and has two children who use Travers Park regularly. â€œI want to request the school to work with the city and the community so that our children can have more open space and a better future.â€ <br /><img src="http://images.zwire.com/local/Z/Zwire2731/zwire/images/Front020311W_I508.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37685">A lot of the negative comments particularly regarding Dr. Marotta feel very personal and agenda-driven and don&#039;t seem to have any constructive purpose.&nbsp; As a parent at Garden School I and many others that I speak to would like park space as much as everyone else. But the true gem of Garden School is not its land...there is other land that could be park space in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The true gem is what happens in Garden School and the love and caring and learning that takes place there every day and night as it&#039;s a second home to all its students and to us parents too.&nbsp; Parents may have strong opinions about whether the yard goes to a developer or not but ask any kid who goes to Garden how they feel and they will tell you that they feel safe and nurtured and they love their teachers, their school and Dr. Marotta who is always there with his door open for them. He knows each and every one of them and they know him.&nbsp; He is a visionary who never sways in his belief in learning, respect, and social responsibility.&nbsp; He teaches that not only to the kids but to us parents too.&nbsp; I&#039;m so grateful that he has been a part of my child&#039;s life and I look forward to many more years with him in our lives.&nbsp; As parents we know that our goal right now is to protect and save this unique and valuable institution and if that means selling the land to a developer then so be it.&nbsp; The school will maintain part of the yard for green space and use the money to provide resources to further enrich the teaching and ensure that Garden is here for our children and grandchildren.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with trying to preserve and expand our quality of life in JH by attempting to get more green space but please let&#039;s not lose perspective on what JH institution is truly at stake here. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_37849">I&#039;ve watched the NY 1 story a couple of times now and I can&#039;t agree that it is fair and balanced. The story does not cover the Community&#039;s effort to help facilitate the sale of the land to the city. In fact it almost makes it seem as if the city hasn&#039;t done anything to make the deal work out. <br /><br />But what it does do is point out that the school seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth. At the meeting at Community Church a few weeks ago the representatives from the school said they wanted the deal with the city to happen but needed money to cover costs while they waited for the ULURP process to go through. However, whoever this Rakosi guy is in the NY1 piece makes it sound as if they aren&#039;t even happy with the amount of money they have been offered and don&#039;t believe there&#039;s money there at all. They can&#039;t have it both ways either they need money upfront to accept the offer or they simply don&#039;t want what has been offered. <br /><br />What&#039;s even more telling to me is his statement that his &quot;Fiduciary responsibility is greater to the students than to the community&quot;. A lot has been said on this board about how the Garden School is a part of the JH community and how we need to consider the &quot;children of Jackson Heights&quot; yet a comment like that tells me something quite different. <br /><br />If the school really wanted this deal to happen I would think they would be looking for ways to make it work rather than publicly blaming the city for not being able to accommodate their current financial situation. Where was the &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; when they started losing money ?</div>

A private foundation also is looking into possibly loaning the school up to $500,000, a source said.<br /><br />&quot;I remain hopeful that the deal will happen,&quot; said City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights), who has spearheaded the push to acquire the property.<br /><br />&quot;The city has given its word that this is extremely high-priority, and they have no intention of backing out of the deal.&quot;<br /><br />But even the community&#039;s generosity may not be enough to sway school officials. It is in bad financial straits after its enrollment dropped with the economy.<br /><br />&quot;If the city came with the money tomorrow, then I&#039;m selling them the property tomorrow,&quot; said Michael Rakosi, vice president of the school&#039;s board of trustees. But &quot;there&#039;s no money down, there&#039;s no date of closing, there&#039;s no contract.&quot;<br /><br />It could take up to two years for the city&#039;s check to clear due to a lengthy acquisition process. Rakosi said the city has not offered to rent the land in the meantime.<br /><br />&quot;Saying they&#039;re going to do it is different than going to contract, putting down a deposit, licensing the property and closing,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;That&#039;s what all the private developers promised, and they&#039;ll do it by putting up the money immediately.&quot;<br /><br />The board is in talks with a handful of developers, he said, and is close to signing a deal.<br /><br />Rakosi added that the board wasn&#039;t interested in accepting a community loan as a stopgap measure because the city could pull out at any time - leaving the school on the hook for paying back the loan.<br /><br />But Edwin Westley, president of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group, wasn&#039;t buying that argument.<br /><br />Westley said that Rakosi challenged him and other local activists at a December meeting to raise money for a loan. Now, after the community has raised about $250,000, the school refuses to meet with them, Westley said.<br /><br />Rakosi, who previously told the Daily News that he didn&#039;t ask the community to raise the money, confirmed that he did, in fact, encourage the fund-raising.<br /><br />&quot;Things have changed since then,&quot; Rakosi said. &quot;The offer did not extend to the end of time.&quot;<br /><br />Nevertheless, Jackson Heights Green Alliance President Dudley Stewart, is still soliciting pledges.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the least amounts of park space per capita in the city, according to New Yorkers for Parks.<br /><br />Stewart would like to link Garden&#039;s yard - more than half the size of a football field - to Travers Park by turning the summer-only 78th St. play street into a permanent pedestrian plaza.<br /><br />&quot;A number of parents of current students are going to withdraw their children from the school if the school sells to a developer,&quot; Stewart said.<br /><br />&quot;If an apartment building goes up, it&#039;s a death sentence for the school.&quot;<br /></div>

An applicant must file a standardized Land Use Review Application and all required accompanying documentation with the Department of City Planning (DCP). Copies of all applications and accompanying material are sent to the affected Borough President, Community Board and the City Council within five business days of receipt. If the application involves land in more than one community district it is also sent to the appropriate borough board. The Borough Board is comprised of the Borough President, all Community Board chairs and City Council members within the affected borough.<br /><br />Certification. DCP is responsible for certifying that the application is complete, and ready for public review through the ULURP process.<br /><br />An application cannot be certified until DCP determines that the application includes all forms, plans and supporting documents that are necessary to address all issues related to the application. If the particular application is subject to environmental review, a negative declaration or a conditional negative declaration or a notice of completion of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement must be issued before an application can be certified. There is no mandated time by which this pre-certification review must be completed. The Charter permits applicants or the affected Borough President to appeal to CPC for certification after six months from the date of application submission.<br /><br />Certified applications are sent within nine days to the affected Community Board, Borough President and the City Council and if appropriate, to the Borough Board.<br /><br />Community Board Review. Within sixty (60) days of receiving the certified application, the Community Board is required to hold a public hearing and adopt and submit a written recommendation to CPC, the applicant, the Borough President and when appropriate, the Borough Board. The ULURP rules include provisions relating to the notice and conduct of a Community Board public hearing. ULURP provisions also govern the quorum, vote and content for a Community Board recommendation. If a Community Board fails to act within its time limit or waives its right to act, the application proceeds to the next level of review.<br /><br />Borough President Review. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Community Board recommendation, or if the Community Board fails to act, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the Community Board&#039;s review period, the Borough President shall submit a written recommendation to the City Planning Commission. If an application involves land in more than one community district, the Borough Board may (within the Borough President&#039;s review period) also review and submit a recommendation to CPC. If the Borough President fails to act within the time limit, the application proceeds to CPC.<br /><br />City Planning Commission Review. CPC must hold a public hearing and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the application within 60 days of the expiration of the Borough President&#039;s review period. City Planning Commission hearings are generally held twice a month on Wednesdays in Spector Hall at 22 Reade Street. Adoption of a CPC report approving, modifying or disapproving an application requires an affirmative vote of seven commissioners. If the Borough President has recommended against an application for site selection, disposition of city owned property or acquisition and has recommended an alternative site pursuant to the fair share provisions of the Charter (section 204), then nine affirmative votes are required. CPC then files copies of its decision with the City Council. In most cases, disapproval of an application by CPC is final and terminates ULURP. Disapproved applications for urban renewal plans are subject to Council review. In addition, disapproved applications for special permits, zoning text changes and zoning map changes that the Mayor has certified as necessary are subject to review by the City Council. (Note: No &quot;certificate of necessity&quot; has been issued by any mayor since ULURP went into effect).<br /><br />City Council Review. The City Council does not automatically review all ULURP actions that are approved by CPC. The Charter requires the Council to review certain actions, some only under special circumstances, and makes provision for the Council to elect to review other actions.<br /><br />The City Council automatically reviews (Mandatory Review):<br /><br />zoning map changes;<br />zoning text changes (not subject to ULURP but subject to Charter section 200 and 201);<br />housing and urban renewal plans;<br />disposition of residential buildings, except to non-profit companies for low-income housing<br />The Council may elect to review the following by voting to take jurisdiction within 20 days after CPC files its report (Council &quot;call-up&quot;):<br /><br />- City Map changes;<br />- maps of subdivisions or plattings;<br />- zoning special permits;<br />- revocable consents, franchise RFPâ€™s, and major concessions;<br />- non-City public improvements;<br />- sanitary and waterfront landfills;<br />- disposition of commercial or vacant property;<br />- disposition of residential buildings to nonprofit companies for low-income housing;<br />- acquisition of real property; and<br />- site selection.<br />Applications disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President (Triple no):<br /><br />An application which is subject to elective review by the Council, will be reviewed if that application was disapproved by the Community Board and Borough President, was approved or approved with modifications by the City Planning Commission, and the Borough President files an objection to CPC approval with the Council and CPC within 5 days of receipt of CPC&#039;s approval.<br />Within 50 days of receipt of the CPC report on an application that is either subject to mandatory review, is &quot;called-up&quot; by the Council, or is a &quot;triple no&quot; application, the Council must hold a public hearing, and approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />If, during the course of its 50-day review period, the Council decides it wants to approve an application with a modification, it can do so only by referring the proposed modification back to CPC. CPC must then determine if the modification is of such significance that additional environmental review is necessary or that additional review pursuant to ULURP is required. If CPC determines that additional review is needed, the Council may not adopt the modification. If no additional review is needed, the Council can adopt the application with the modification. When the Council proposes a modification, CPC has 15 days to make its determination and during that period the City Council&#039;s 50-day clock is stopped.<br /><br />A City Council action approving, approving with modifications or disapproving most CPC actions, requires a majority vote of the Council. Urban Renewal Plans that have been disapproved by CPC can only be approved by a 3/4 vote of the Council.<br /><br />If the Council fails to act within its review period, the Council shall be deemed to have approved the decision of the City Planning Commission.<br /><br />Mayoral Review. Mayoral approval is not required. A decision by the City Council to approve or disapprove a land use application is considered to be final unless the Mayor elects to veto a Council action within 5 days of the vote. The Council, by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of its decision within 10 days of the veto.<br /><br />Applications approved by CPC that the Council did not assume jurisdiction or act on within its 50 day review can also be vetoed by the Mayor within 5 days of the expired Council time period. The Council , by a 2/3 vote, can override a Mayor&#039;s veto of the CPC decision within ten days of the veto. </div>

And what is the plan for the &quot;open space?&quot; Why the secrecy?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As City officials have repeatedly stated, the plan is to purchase the land as park-land as an extension of Travers Park. There have not been any formal discussions of how the park-land would be constructed. I think this is an area where the City will look to the Community and the Garden School to give guidance and direction.<br /><br />In terms of &#039;secrecy&#039; -- I&#039;m not sure what you mean? The only thing that seems to be secret is: Who are the private developers and what are their plans for building on that lot? </div>
