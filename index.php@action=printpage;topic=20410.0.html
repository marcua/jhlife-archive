				Just a shout-out to support our local restaurants.<br /><br />The last few times I&#039;ve gone to El Toum Lebanese either for take-out or just walking by it was empty of customers. I&#039;d hate to lose this neighborhood gem. High quality, healthy fare at reasonable prices.<br />

Order pickup from El Toum! Then swing by as quickly as you can and take it home!

				Had a really bad delivery experience with them...took over 1 1/2 hours and the food packaging was so poor, it was not appetizing to eat.&nbsp; Wish them well, but would recommend they improve their delivery service.

				Tried El Toum for the first time this past weekend. Was SO GOOD. And huge portions. Delivered within 15 mins! Only negative was no napkins/utensils in the bag. But an A- indeed.

				It&#039;s practically a one-man operation there, so they do drop the ball sometimes. Including forgetting to include part of the order, which happened to us a few nights ago. But we think overall it&#039;s a great addition to the food options here, so we just remember to stress &quot;please don&#039;t forget&quot; whatever it is when we order.

				We haven&#039;t had a chance to try El Toum yet, as we are not big on take out/delivery, but had some Lebanese dishes from Sammy back during the Juju days.&nbsp; Always first rate.&nbsp; We are excited to give it a go with dine-in now that that&#039;s opening up.

				we haven&#039;t tried a lot of things -- we&#039;re also not big on delivery or takeout these days -- but everything from El Toum has been really good so far. highly recommend the appetizer combo, with spreads and falafel. generous portion, generously spiced (not heat, but flavor).
