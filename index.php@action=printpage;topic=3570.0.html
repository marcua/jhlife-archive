				I saw some great costumes this year at the Jackson Heights Halloween parade, and have to say that I&#039;m liking this more and more each year. Much better than the Village cause its in the hood and for the kids. One of the cutest costumes I saw was a little boy dressed up as a UPS driver, pulling a cart behind him with UPS packages on it. It was hilarious!! Was wondering if anyone else saw a costume worthy to mention?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Very cool!&nbsp; We must have been in a different part of the parade, we didn&#039;t see a lot of these ...<br /><br />My pictures didn&#039;t come out so hot except a few (I&#039;m more a point and shoot and pray type), but here&#039;s one ...
