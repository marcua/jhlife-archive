				Your friend should go online to the NYS health exchange and see what plans he might qualify for. The loss of a job is a special circumstance that should allow him to sign up for health insurance even though it&#039;s not the open enrollment period.<br /><br />https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov<br /><br />I think he should be able to find some sort of coverage through the exchange that is cheaper than $1200/month.

				I threw thousands away on COBRA. Don&#039;t let your friend make the same mistake. <br /><br />If one is out of a job and really needs medical care, NY Presby is right around the corner. They will consider current income and adjust the bill and work out installments.<br /><br />I don&#039;t qualify for Medicaid. I was hospitalized last year for a week (NYP in UES Manhattan), had every test imaginable and three blood transfusions. My bill was I think 16,000, maybe more. It was reduced to something ridiculous, like $800. There were no deductions, however, for the doctor&#039;s bills. Those I had to pay in full, but we agreed on an installment plan. They worked with me every step of the way.

				Your friend might want to look into short-term insurance, which is extremely limited but also generally MUCH cheaper than buying on the individual market. One catch though is that short-term plans were not available at all in New York State when I last checked; might be worth looking again though, since a lot of the rules around short-term insurance changed recently at the federal level.<br /><br />More background:<br />https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/01/652141154/buyer-beware-new-cheaper-insurance-policies-may-have-big-coverage-gaps<br />https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/short-term-health-insurance
