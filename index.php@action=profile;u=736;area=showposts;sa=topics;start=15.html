					I was going through a pile of mail on my table today and came across an &quot;important change in terms notice enclosed--please read&quot; notice from Chase credit card (you know, those notices a lot of people simply throw out).&nbsp; The notice states that they will be &quot;making some changes to your credit card account in response to market conditions and to maintain profitability on your account&quot;; i.e.--INCREASING the interest rate.&nbsp; It then states that you can accept the increase by doing nothing, or you can choose to not accept the rate increase, in which case you have to close your account (you will still owe your balance, but wouldn&#039;t have to pay it back immediately--you&#039;d continue to get a monthly statement but not be able to charge anything else to the credit card).&nbsp; I just called them and cancelled my account.<br /><br />So, if you have a chase credit card, you may want to look into this.&nbsp; I already hate Chase because I previously had a Wamu card, and Chase purchased Wamu.&nbsp; I always had paid my Wamu card after I received the &quot;reminder&quot; notice from them via email, something I had set up on the account.&nbsp; I had a balance on my Wamu card that I had transferred over with a 1.99% rate until 2010.&nbsp; When Chase took over, I didn&#039;t receive my reminder notice, and I missed a payment.&nbsp; I realized this a few days later and I called them, explaining the situation and asking if they could waive the late fee this one time, and that I would immediately make a payment.&nbsp; They refused, and then I notice that because of my late payment, they had jacked my rate up to 22.24%!&nbsp; They also refused to change that.&nbsp; Now, I completely acknowledge that it was ultimately my fault that I missed the payment, but what happened to customer service?&nbsp; I hate them, and once I finish paying them off, will never do business with them again.<br /><br />Also, if you know of any other forums to post this to warn people... can&#039;t let them get away with this!

					My friend will be in the area tomorrow for a very limited amount of time, and I want to meet him quickly for a cup of coffee or a drink.&nbsp; He has less than half an hour, and I don&#039;t want parking to be an issue.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a little coffee shop or cafe (even dunkin donuts or starbucks is fine) with seating and a parking lot?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking Northern Blvd would be a good option, but I don&#039;t know that area very well and can&#039;t think of a place to tell him to meet me.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated!

					I&#039;m trying to file my taxes online, and there is a question about which school district I am in (I live in Woodside, 67th Ave/41st Street, zip code 11377).&nbsp; I have no idea what school district I am in, since I don&#039;t have kids and therefore don&#039;t really care.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t think this mattered if I didn&#039;t own a house, but the site is not letting me move on.&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to get my taxes out ASAP and am annoyed at the holdup.&nbsp; Does anyone know?

					I was trying to get to Astoria today, but several roads were blocked off!&nbsp; I attempted to take my usual route--down Woodside Ave to Northern Blvd, but there were police barricades starting around 63rd St.&nbsp; I went down Queens Blvd instead and attempted to turn right at 43rd St, but again--police barricades, maybe trying to prevent cars from getting to Northern Blvd?&nbsp; I was finally able to get to Northern when I reached 35th St.&nbsp; Just wondering if anyone knows why this was all blocked off?

					I noticed this morning that my water had a brownish tint. You can&#039;t tell it&#039;s brown running out of the faucet, but against my white sink and bathtub, you can see a tint of brown.&nbsp; My super said it&#039;s probably because they were doing some kind of construction across the street.&nbsp; He recommends just using a brita and filtering the water from the sink through there (that&#039;s what his family does).<br /><br />Just wondering if this happens to anyone else, and IS the water really safe to drink?&nbsp;
