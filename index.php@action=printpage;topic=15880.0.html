				There was tape across the road on 76th Street so the road was blocked from GNC to the other side of the street .It looked like crime scene tape but as we were slowly driving by it is hard to say anything with certainty There seemed to be a small cluster of people(perhaps 25 or so)on the Foodtown side of the street looking on. Also from a car window we saw what appeared to be a sheet over something (or somebody) near GNC. Can&#039;t provide anything more but I hope it wasn&#039;t a serious crime incident.
