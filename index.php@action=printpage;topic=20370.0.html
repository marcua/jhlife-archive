				&nbsp;I am not exactly sure about these but I had the tastiest enchiladas last night from El Rinco Tinto with chicken. They do have Mexican and Columbian dishes and we have had fabulous meals from them all the time. I notice lately they are doing more specials. BTW they cook for World Kitchen some of the time for Covid needs.

				I had the Enchiladas Suizas at ERT last week and I wasn&#039;t impressed. Too much sauce and the enchiladas became too soggy for my taste. I used to like City Coffee&#039;s version of the dish, but they&#039;re long gone. Still like the ERT&#039;s platanos with guac and cheese, and the salmon al pastor was tasty, but I wouldn&#039;t order the Enchiladas Suizas again.

				A couple of weeks ago I went to La Casa de Julia in Woodside (Roosevelt Ave. &amp; 65th St.). I asked the waiter what he recommended, and he said if I wanted traditional Mexican, then order the enchiladas suizas. I did -- they were very good. <br /><br />Though I will note I haven&#039;t eaten them from many places to compare.<br /><br />
