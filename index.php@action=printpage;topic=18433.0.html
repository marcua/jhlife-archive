				This guy is part of some inception of the same skinhead crew that murdered Julio Rivera in Jackson Heights. Or I guess the murderers were trying to impress these guys.<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/18/nyregion/the-symbols-spawned-by-a-killing.html<br /><br />If anyone is at all familiar with this culture in the context of the &quot;hardcore scene&quot; (CBGS in the 90&#039;s) it was always different groups of meat heads who go around looking for a fight. A simple violent mob mentality. They have always come up with all sorts of stupid justifications for this kind of violence. Be it love of country or pride in your race. All bogus excuses to beat someone up.<br /><br />The proud boys basically represent this without a music scene or even a sports team attached.
