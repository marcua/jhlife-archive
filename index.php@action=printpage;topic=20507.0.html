				A few miles from Jackson Heights there is an indie theater which is a locally owned and a terrific asset nearby called the Kew Gardens Cinema. The F train stops nearby and it&#039;s about 10 minutes by car. If you are missing in person movies, please visit them soon and know that your support is appreciated. They show films similar to Manhattan&#039;s Angelica theater for a bunch less and they have children&#039;s films and some streaming situation also.There are 5-6 theaters, sweet young people working the concession and tickets and sanitizing all over. Homemade cookies too! Loved &quot;Nomadland&quot; on the giant screen and feel like it was more immersive with the desert landscape that it every would have been at home. Order a great<br />pizza across the street timed for exiting the movie and you have a lovely night.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; https://www.kewgardenstheatre.com/movies

				I will second or third the recommendation. We have gone there often and always wondered if many JH residents go there--it is rarely crowded, does cost less than most theaters, and shows the good movies! I was assuming they would be gone post-pandemic--it&#039;s great to know they are open again. Such a nice theater and really so close.

				Today was the first time since Covid that we decided to go to the Movies.&nbsp; <br />We went to Kew Gardens and saw the Anthony Bourdain documentary titled Roadrunner.&nbsp; <br />Excellent film &amp; delightful normal movie going experience.&nbsp; <br />We preordered our tickets, and selected our seats. No surprises, no issues.<br /><br />This particular theater is our favorite, and with virtually no crowds it feels like a safe environment.&nbsp; (We are vaccinated- and masks are optional if you are too)
