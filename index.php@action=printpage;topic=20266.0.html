				&nbsp;Off to a weird start and then DOT person says they are committed to keeping this success story open. Huh? Wasn&#039;t it a discussion to hear from various points of view as to whether it should be an open street, post pandemic, for 12hrs a day? Hope there is room still for serious debate and acknowledgement of fixes, needed not just heaps of praise for present situation.

				Fixes like enforcement against drivers who drive around the barriers and zip down a block because they don&#039;t want to drive another block to Northern or 35th? And maybe some enforcement against the petulant horn honkers who night after night are shocked that there is traffic on the cross streets in Jackson heights during the evening rush hour and take it out on our neighborhood residents? <br />It sound like itsit is against making the open street permanent, but has not articulated why. <br />

				There seemed to be a bit of an agenda from DOT moderator for keeping Open Streets.&nbsp; Someone needs to get Danny Dromm and Jessica Ramos cameras, so they can be seen when speaking to constituents on Zoom. In the end, hopefully they heard the many concerns from people who actually live on 34th and the neighboring streets.&nbsp; Traffic and honking is often unbearable on 35th certain times since the closure. Interesting DOT didnâ€™t seem to want to focus on overall traffic issues beyond 34th.

				I for one am delighted that DOT is interested in finding a way to keep it open. It has been amazing. <br /><br />The argument about traffic and honking frankly applies to the entire neighborhood, and I therefore don&#039;t think that 34th av is somehow unique in their needs. I&#039;d love to hear a solution for the entire neighborhood. <br /><br />But it&#039;s been amazing to see the community enjoy Open Streets and take ownership and advantage it. I wouldn&#039;t want to see it ceded back to cars at the expense of us humans.

				Much like how folks complained about 14th St in Manhattan being closed to traffic and instead used for public transport and pedestrians...and how people were against Diversity Plaza being created by excluding vehicles....the same happens with 34th Ave.<br /><br />All of these throughways have turned out to be great successes once cars are banned.<br /><br />And this absolutely applies for 34th Ave too.

				&nbsp; Are we talking about the 34th Ave Open Streets in active Pandemic- or Post Pandemic? <br /><br />These seem like two entirely different things. How can something be evaluated for permanence when impermanence is our norm now? Many of the people who spoke with concerns last night live on 34th ave and see much more than an hour a day of activity (or lack thereof) within the 12hour<br />closure. It was also noted that a number of the people who spoke were completely in favor and had known positions by the moderator. One commentator mentioned she had never even heard of alternative voice until last night. The discussion needs to be more inclusive and broader, though for a first go, a number of good alternatives and compromises were put forward. Also the city is BROKE right now which has to be front and center of any discussion.<br /><br />&nbsp;Urban planners, please come forward if you are out there. Lawsuits are expensive and not getting this right will result in endless litigation. Let&#039;s please avoid this! One more thing is Diversity Plaza isn&#039;t a great local project to put forward as a comparison. It went from being a man space that was pretty trashy to a man space that is less trashy and has some lovely formal type plantings and gets cleans several times a day but is still...trashy. Literal trash, empty food containers, all kinds of trash on street. Still. Additionally, the green mound at Travers is in limbo as it is so costly (labor) to maintain and gets ruined every fews days without the fencing. This was another hugely popular community ask but is now a questionable choice a few years later as it replaced free play areas that the zumba classes or other activities might have used. A better comparison is the Woodhaven Blvd. bus route 53 which was studied and discussed door to door and now is the only MTA bus route with an &quot;A&quot; rating in the city. All sides were considered and they took their time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Discuss/Plan/Wait for Vaccine/Discuss more/Plan more...what is the hurry if something would be really great and a true solid benefit to all in the neighborhood? There are considerably less people using the ave now - fact- so what will the impact be when we were are back up with full schedules?Coming up with a plan post-vaccine makes the most sense. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				34th Ave is a huge and beloved success for pedestrians. Who are the majority of folks in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I suppose that is hard to accept for those who are against it.<br /><br />Much like election results are hard to accept when they don&#039;t go the way a person wants.

Despite what you read in various places, there&#039;s no proof that a majority of residents support making Open Streets permanent. There&#039;s no proof because residents have not been surveyed. This meeting was the first listening session offered, and there were comments in support and comments against, and plenty of comments from people who support some aspects of the program but have legitimate concerns they want addressed. <br /><br />The meeting was not advertised widely (only on social media) and it was only open to people who felt comfortable with a Zoom meeting. I would imagine this excludes many older residents who may not have known about the meeting or didn&#039;t know how to Zoom adequately.<br /><br />Since you missed the meeting, you can still make comments by email to the following addresses. (I only sent mine to John O&#039;Neill but it makes sense to send to all the available addresses.)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/SYM6lGE.jpg)<br />

The 34th Ave open street does not prevent that. Sure it makes driving more inconvenient at times, but it does not preclude driving in the neighborhood. <br />Opening 34th back up to traffic will completely take away the one significant open space in the neighborhood that people can walk, ride, and play on. It sounds like you want to completely take away something that adds great benefit to MANY in the community because it causes a minor inconvenience to some residents (and many non residents). It&#039;s basically &quot;all for me, none for you&quot;. The selfishness exhibited in that position is amazing. <br />&nbsp;

				Saturday December 12 on one of the warmest evenings in awhile, there were few people walking on the street at 6:30 pm. There was plenty of room to walk on the sidewalk--in fact I felt less safer walking on 35th Avenue where there was more traffic and people around.&nbsp; Would like to have the Open Street, but DOT needs to clearly evaluate the need to have this year round between 8 am to 8pm.&nbsp;

Have you considered that it just might be your block that&#039;s empty? For example, I&#039;ve consistently noticed since the spring that usage is lighter down near 69th St. through the lower 70s. And I&#039;d be curious what you consider &quot;practically deserted&quot;? If there are five people on the block, is that practically deserted? 2? 10?<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been up or near the Avenue since the weather has turned more winter-like this week, but throughout November and early December I was regularly returning home from work in the evening hours and routinely saw groups of people walking/jogging on 34th Avenue after dark. I&#039;m not totally made up in my mind whether or not the hours should remain as they are, but I also think we shouldn&#039;t misrepresent the use Open Streets gets in the evening hours..
