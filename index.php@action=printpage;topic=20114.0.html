				It was definitely not a two or three week run. I live right across the street and was thrilled at the idea of him serving dinner, so I was paying close attention. I think he literally served dinner ONE evening, and then told people he had to get more up to speed and work out the kinks before really starting dinner service. We had not gone there that one night but were planning to go the next night. But then he announced he would not do it after all, too demanding and difficult, I presumed. For that one night, he had a paper menu printed up (we took one home that day) and was serving the sorts of dishes he has always served at JuJu&#039;s--at least that&#039;s what I recall. It&#039;s really too bad. His food was great and I remember going there a lot around the time we moved here in 2011--getting coffee and lunch as we moved in, etc. It&#039;s really too bad. But he ran that place alone with the help of wife and son, and I imagine that&#039;s pretty hard to keep going. And how could he run dinner service too on that basis? I wouldn&#039;t hold my breath waiting for him to open a Lebanese restaurant in that space. Highly unlikely--more likely someone on FB was expressing a wish that he would do so. I&#039;d be thrilled and surprised if that rumor is true, though.

				i didn&#039;t realize it was literally one night. i had one of those printed menus, too, and i had hopes, since Sami&#039;s prepared dishes (especially the soups) are quite good. thanks for a more detailed, more accurate recollection.

				The neighborhood is getting close to the ability to sustain this but... here&#039;s my question: Is there one restaurant here that does not primarily cater to it&#039;s own culture? Do we have any restaurants whose bread and butter is being &quot;exotic&quot;? Maybe Arunee but hard to consider it that since it&#039;s so close to Thaitown.

				What I would give for a delicious Falafel or Shwarma in the neighborhood...right now I have to head to Sunnyside, Astoria, or Forest Hills.&nbsp; This would be a good location for that, but anytime there is an attempt in Jackson Heights for food outside of our standard neighborhood cuisines it seems to lack quality.&nbsp; Hoping this proved me wrong.

				Work is being done inside JuJu&#039;s and the owner is there. I&#039;m thinking maybe he&#039;s turning it into a retail/takeout place instead of a sit-down cafe? That might be easier to keep going in covid times? Has anyone asked him?

				Sami hasn&#039;t been there when i&#039;ve walked by, but the inside demolition looks pretty thorough. i agree that it seems like a full on change in direction, more than a change in cuisine.
