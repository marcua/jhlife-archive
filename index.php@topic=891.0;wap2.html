			&nbsp;:rockon:<br />My name is Hana Dolgin, and I am an independent licensed broker, which means I am not affiliated with any other agency. I have been selling coops and condos in Jackson Heights for about six and half years now. I lived in Jackson Heights for three years, so I know the neighborhood and most of the buildings really well, and have a lot of experience in helping buyers to find the apartment of house of their realistic dreams.<br /><br />I would be happy to help you find what best suits your needs and budget. Please feel free to contact me at 917 509-3256 or email apts.hd@gmail.com.<br /><br />All the best,<br />Hana
