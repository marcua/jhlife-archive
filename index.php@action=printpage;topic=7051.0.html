				extract from Dale Carnegie&#039;s book:<br /><br /><br />Rule No. 9: II necessary, make a little extra money off your kitchen stove.<br /><br /><br />If after you budget your expenses wisely you still find that you don&#039;t have enough to make ends meet, you can then do one of two things: you can either scold, fret, worry, and complain, or you can plan to make a little additional money on the side. How? Well, all you have to do to make money is to fill an urgent need that isn&#039;t being adequately filled now. That is what Mrs. Nellie Speer, 37-09 83rd Street, Jackson Heights, New York, did. In 1932, she found herself living alone in a three-room apartment. Her husband had died, and both of her children were married. One day, while having some ice-cream at a drug-store soda fountain, she noticed that the fountain was also selling bakery pies that looked sad and dreary. She asked the proprietor if he would buy some real home-made pies from her. He ordered two. &quot;Although I was a good cook,&quot; Mrs. Speer said, as she told me the story, &quot;I had always had servants when we lived in Georgia, and I had never baked more than a dozen pies in my life. After getting that order for two pies, I asked a neighbour woman how to cook an apple-pie. The soda-fountain customers were delighted with my first two home-baked pies, one apple, one lemon. The drugstore ordered five the next day. Then orders gradually came in from other fountains and luncheonettes. Within two years, I was baking five thousand pies a year-I was doing all the work myself in my own tiny kitchen, and I was making a thousand dollars a year clear, without a penny&#039;s expense except the ingredients that went into the pies.&quot;<br /><br /><br />The demand for Mrs. Speer&#039;s home-baked pastry became so great that she had to move out of her kitchen into a shop and hire two girls to bake for her: pies, cakes, bread, and rolls. During the war, people stood in line for an hour at a time to buy her home-baked foods.<br /><br /><br />&quot;I have never been happier in my life,&quot; Mrs. Speer said. &quot;I work in the shop twelve to fourteen hours a day, but I don&#039;t get tired because it isn&#039;t work to me. It is an adventure in living. I am doing my part to make people a little happier. I am too busy to be lonesome or worried. My work has filled a gap in my life left vacant by the passing of my mother and husband and my home.&quot;<br /><br /><br />When I asked Mrs. Speer if she felt that other women who were good cooks could make money in their spare time in a similar way, in towns of ten thousand and up, she replied: &quot;Yes-of course they can!&quot;<br />

				Good story that I never heard. I was born in Jackson Heights in 1938 and lived on 82 Street and 35th Avenue. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school, P.S. 69 for Kindergarten and graduated from St. Joan of Arc Grammar School in 1952. Nellie Spears&#039; cakes were always my birthday cakes of choice. Especially one white cake with white icing that was particularly delicious. Big event out was a hamburger at Edson&#039;s on 37th Avenue and picking up a Nellie Spear treat for desert. By the way Edson&#039;s son became an early executive with McDonalds before they went public in 1966.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				The great &quot;Nellie Speer&quot;. Wonderful pies, cakes and honey buns. The drug store/soda parlor on the South West corner of 37th Avenue and 82nd Street before it was Moss&#039;s Drug Store was I believe Liggett&#039;s in the 40&#039;s and early 50&#039;s. Where Field&#039;s Dept. Store was an old fashioned candy store Fanny Farmer that actually sold individual candy to &quot;feather merchants&quot; like myself (under the age of 9). Liggett&#039;s had a wonderful E-W soda fountain where a nice guy soda jerk sold everyone nickel cokes, later a dime. Famous English muffins toasted. (Soda-jerk lived on 82 Street in an apt. between 35 and 34 Ave with his parents and his name was John Erickson and became a movie actor. One movie I can remember he was in was Bad Day at Black Rock starring Spencer Tracy, Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin.)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Nellie Speer&#039;s was our bakery of choice. Her lemon meringue pies changed my life.
