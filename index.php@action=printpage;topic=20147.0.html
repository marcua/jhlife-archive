				Are you positive the mamma squirrel is dead? Can you put it in a warm box near where you found it to see if the mamma comes back? Are there other babies? It might take a few hours for her to come back.&nbsp; The nest might have been destroyed and Squirrels usually have several nests.

				Hi, someone had found a dead squirrel in the garden shortly before we found the baby squirrel wandering around on the grass.&nbsp; We have a little box for it with a small blanket and it stayed in it over night.&nbsp; We have been feeding it some peanut butter (which it loves), and giving it milk through an eye dropper.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am contacting some NYC agencies today.&nbsp;

				Hi, thanks for everyone’s support and ideas.&nbsp; The little squirrel is doing well.&nbsp; We have created a bed in the garden’s shed and she (not sure of the sex) is eating the berries and peanut butter and other goodies we leave for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are also giving her baby formula which she laps up.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is very active during the day, and then comes back to the shed in the afternoon to nap.&nbsp; &nbsp;She really loves the garden, and we are hoping that she can thrive there.&nbsp; Fortunately, there is a group of us who are looking out for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fingers crossed!

				Hi, Babette (yes, we named the squirrel) is doing fine—eating lots of food, and getting bigger.&nbsp; She is staying in the shed most nights, and then hangs out in the garden during the day.&nbsp; She is just getting the hang of climbing trees, and hoping that she can live a long squirrel life.
