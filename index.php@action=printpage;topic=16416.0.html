				Hi, all- I know this is always a difficult topic, but we&#039;re hoping to rehome our male tabby cat, Claude. This is what is best for his sake, our sake, and the sake of our two female cats. We recently relocated to the neighborhood from Brooklyn, and have been trying to help Claude settle into our new one bedroom apartment. Although Claude is very friendly toward humans, he is dangerously aggressive toward our two female cats. This is a behavior he&#039;s exhibited for the past several years, that we&#039;ve been struggling to manage. We&#039;ve spoken with our vet, and have tried countless anxiety treats, collars, and medications. We had hoped being in a new environment, where everyone is on a level playing field, would improve or correct his behavior. Unfortunately, it hasn&#039;t. Again, Claude is very loving and affectionate toward humans. He loves playing, being pet, and snuggling up on the couch. He would absolutely need to be in a single cat environment (not sure how he would react to a dog). Claude is healthy, and is up to date on all of his shots. If you or anyone you know may be interested in welcoming Claude into your home, please let me know. As some of you probably know, when it comes to rehoming animals, its difficult to know who to trust online. We&#039;re hoping this forum will provide a shield against shaming, people looking for &quot;bait&quot; animals, or people trying to sell animals for lab testing. We just want Claude to happily transition into the loving home he deserves. Thank you.
