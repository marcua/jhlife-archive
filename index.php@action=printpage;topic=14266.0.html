				DOUGLAS ELLIMAN JUST RELEASED: <br />Our exclusive 4th Quarter 2015 Elliman Report for Queens<br /><br />file:///C:/Users/leaf/Downloads/Queens_4Q_2015_highlights%20(2).pdf<br /><br />We have just released the fourth quarter 2015 “Elliman Reports” for the Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess sales markets; the leading resources on the state of these markets. We are proud to add Northwest Queens to our growing list. As always, our market reports are produced in conjunction with Miller Samuel to provide you and your clients with the most comprehensive and neutral market insight available. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Brooklyn housing market continued to be on a tear, with prices rising for the fourth consecutive year. Inventory was not able to keep up with rising sales. Tight conditions along with a robust city economy kept the pressure on the housing market.<br />&nbsp;<br />Housing prices in Queens continued to flirt with new record highs. The pace of the market remained fast&nbsp; with more sales and less inventory. In our new report, Northwest queens experienced a jump in sales activity from the year before.<br />&nbsp;<br />Westchester county continued to benefit from rising housing prices in New York City resulting in high sales volume and less inventory. Fourth quarter sales were at their highest level since 2004.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Putnam county housing market moved much more quickly than last year with more sales and less inventory. Despite the faster moving pace, housing prices slipped from year ago levels.<br />&nbsp;<br />Inventory rose faster than sales as the market pace in&nbsp; Dutchess county eased. Single family prices remained stable as condo prices slipped.<br />&nbsp;<br />At Douglas Elliman, we are constantly looking for ways to provide our clients with better information, empowering them to make more informed decisions. Our efforts to create this market report series reflect our strong belief that access to timely information is a vital resource in a market that is constantly changing. Committed to providing the best information in the industry, we are proud to offer this service to our clients. Explore our full market report series covering Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Northwest Queens, Long Island, The Hamptons, North Fork, Westchester, Putnam &amp; Dutchess Counties, Fairfield County, Greenwich, Miami, Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Los Angeles and Aspen&nbsp; reports at http://www.elliman.com/marketreports <br />&nbsp;<br />Warmest regards,<br />Dottie Herman<br />President and CEO<br />Douglas Elliman<br />&nbsp;<br />*Visit&nbsp; http://www.elliman.com to search more than 239,600 listings and access all of our current market reports.<br />______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Marlene Flores - 917-208-6709<br />Douglas Elliman Real Estate<br />47-37 Vernon Blvd.<br />Long Island City, NY<br />marlene.flores@elliman.com
