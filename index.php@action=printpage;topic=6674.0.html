				As I noted in the JH Transportation Study thread, the city often starts with a low-cost, quick-to-implement temporary design, and then does some outreach before settling on a more permanent design.&nbsp; <br /><br />They painted the street today.&nbsp; Hopefully some seating will arrive soon, but don&#039;t expect anything fancy to start with.

				For someone like me who spent every week in the old Earle Theatre(now the sad old Eagle) watching Saturday morning serials and then as I grew up older foreign films, the forlorn state of this surrounding area is heartbreaking. For those who never knew the Earle it was a little gem with a dark&nbsp; green and crystal thirties lobby and a devoted audience. As I recall it was the smallest of the theatres in Jackson Heights both the now gone Boulevard and the hanging in there Jackson both had double or triple the capacity with only the Colony on 82nd St having anything like the intimacy of the Earle. The once great Earle is now the dead, dying decrepit Eagle with the area around it similarly uncared for. <br /><br />So if&nbsp; there is a moral arc to this story&nbsp; not only would there be a pedestrianised islet at the descent to the subway, providence might also allow for the Earle to be revived and become if not exactly its former self at least a cleaned up and welcoming venue for films and community events. Is there even a slight hope that something like that might happen?

				E train -- Sadly, except for the marquee, the theater is gone.&nbsp; It has been gutted and is being converted into small shops.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen inside, but I doubt there&#039;s much in there to save.&nbsp; Over the long run, who knows, somebody could buy the building and rebuild a theater inside of it.&nbsp; But I think it&#039;s unlikely in the near term.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I think this little block has a bright future.&nbsp; It was overrun with traffic, and now has a chance to become a bit of an oasis.<br />

				I happened upon the pedestrian plaza yesterday, and took the opportunity to have lunch there. We bought award winning street food on 73rd and B&#039;way, and shared our table with an old Sikh guy. It was very pleasant. I&#039;m glad it&#039;s there. Hopefully the trees will come soon. <br /><br />A heads-up though...the business community is against it, and has printed vinyl signs saying so, and vowing to return traffic to the area.

				Closing off that block of 37th Road was also part of reducing the number of possible turns and helping traffic flow on Broadway, 73 and 74 Streets.&nbsp; The plaza is an added benefit of simplifying traffic patterns.&nbsp; Some of the merchants comments don&#039;t make sense, although&nbsp; I have concerns about vendors taking over the plaza and hurting their businesses.&nbsp; Residents have paid a high price over the years for all of the non-local traffic that descends on our community.&nbsp; Residents&#039; favorable assessments need to be taken into consideration and are a very large part of the equation as well.

				You are completely right. The city needs to be involved in maintaining whatthey created. Of course a little help from the community should be welcommed. And the shops there aught to be especially concerned as well as the rest in the area that hope to attract business. <br /><br />As for rats being far behind - cross over and look around the NW corner of 73rd &amp; Roosevelt where the #7 escalator comes down. That whole area is already infested as is the bottom of the escalator where Broadway &amp; Roosevelt meet.

				A few things to keep in mind about the city&#039;s public plaza program:<br /><br />- Everywhere in the city this program has been implemented, a local organization has taken responsibility for maintenance of the plaza.&nbsp; Usually it&#039;s a business improvement district, but sometimes it&#039;s a local non-profit.&nbsp; I think discussions are still ongoing about who the local partner will be.&nbsp; But I think instead of looking to the city for help, I think we should be asking the neighborhood&#039;s businesses why they can&#039;t begin to take responsibility for maintaining their highly successful little business district.&nbsp; (I&#039;ve heard that there are some pretty sharp divisions within the business community itself, which prevents them from working together to get anything done).<br /><br />- The city has said several times that work on a permanent design for the plaza will begin in the spring.&nbsp; We should expect nothing less than a top-notch design for the plaza.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that will require our active participation to get it done.&nbsp; See my earlier post (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=3015.msg41426#msg41426) about how the design for Times Square has evolved.

				I had one idea and one question.<br /><br />On my way to work yesterday, I &quot;bussed&quot; one table that was covered with the remains of a large group&#039;s takeout meal. It was a little gross, but luckily there were plastic bags left with the other garbage so I didn&#039;t have to touch anything messy and it took a minute or two, max.<br /><br />I wonder if those of us who want the plaza to stay might make this a habit -- I don&#039;t think we can count on the business owners there who are against the plaza to clean up, since the worse it looks, the more likely it is to be abandoned.<br /><br />And, what about he Doe foundation? Does anyone know where they clean? Could we request them to add the plaza to their rounds?

				My understanding about the Doe Foundation is this (and my husband has a much better understanding than I do, but I can&#039;t ask him right now): typically, these are paid for by a local BID. However, 74th Street is almost exclusively owned by one landlord, and he has no interest in sponsoring anything (and as someone mentioned, there are quite a few rifts among the business owners). Now, I may be remembering what I heard incorrectly, but I believe the Doe Fund was sponsored some other way, and that&#039;s why we only have a part-time Doe Fund, instead of a full-time Doe Fund.<br /><br />So, they may be cleaning the Plaza, but my guess is that we need a full-time Doe Fund. I would be willing to do any of the following:<br />1. Work on a volunteer committee to help clean (although my time is limited when I work full-time and obviously, we need a number of people to make this effective)<br />2. Pressure the landlord (in ways TBD) to make up the other half of the Doe Fund so we could get full-time help (which that street warrants)<br />3. Organize a fundraiser for a full-time Doe Fund<br /><br />Doe Fund may now be full-time, since it&#039;s been a while since I talked about this, but I&#039;ll ask around to confirm.<br /><br />General thoughts? <br /><br />And thanks for bussing a table! I really think there needs to be a return to anti-littering campaigns, like the Native American chief I remember so vividly from my youth. (Maybe we can pressure the local schools to start something, so kids will educate their parents?)

And there was a brand new trash can set up in the middle of the block (with a plastic liner), which now makes 3 trash cans in total for that area (2 others on the corners). Two uniformed city workers were there cleaning up, too.&nbsp; :D

				&nbsp;Had a conversation with one of the shop owners this evening on the pedestrian plaza. The complaint was specifically about the loss of Elmhurst<br />Hospital workers/visitors through the street. I was thinking that things looked as busy or not when I went through on my usual times but they<br />say that the Elmhurst folks are now patronizing the businesses on the other side of Roosevelt. Since the hospital is staffed 24/7 this must account<br />for a large number of people not spending on 37th road and finally, I see the financial problem. Also the carts must be hurting as I heard before<br />that Sammy&#039;s Halal can make over $5,000. on a good day. Not alot of this going to rent either...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, still love the pedestrian plaza but am worried the numbers are a problem. What can be done to increase the sales for these folks?<br />

				Planting some trees would help business (in Spring, anyway). Studies have shown that trees attract customers. A few wooden benches would be great, too. I think most people are more comfortable sharing a bench with a stranger than a table (i.e., no forced eye contact).

				There&#039;s quite a lot that could be done to beautify that plaza and perhaps increase sales or foot traffic.&nbsp; There are only 4 big tables in the plaza, yet there&#039;s room for plenty smaller and nicer looking ones.&nbsp; Take a look at any of the many pedestrian plazas in Manhattan where they&#039;ve done an amazing job with the spaces.&nbsp; Take a look at the upcoming Queens Plaza greenspace.&nbsp; I am hoping that come this spring, the city would be willing to invest in planters, trees, chairs, tables, trashcans, and cleanup crew - to make it a more welcome, inviting place.&nbsp; The other night I did not see many trash cans at all, despite the volunteer crew that was said to come in this past weekend.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s increasing, but I&#039;m noticed a few more beggars hanging around the area of the plaza now. The plaza is not that inviting of a place with all the trash, lack of seating, and concrete barrenness.&nbsp; It&#039;s not someplace I would seek to hang out in - and I&#039;m clamoring for greenspace to even just sit down and read a book in.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has nothing - no greenspace at all.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t it be wonderful if it did?&nbsp;

				frmo today&#039;s Daily News<br /><br />Jackson Heights pedestrian plaza has South Asian merchants in uproar&nbsp; <br />Business owners to rally for its removal, claiming plaza hurting sales <br />BY CLARE TRAPASSO / NEW YORK DAILY NEWS <br /><br />South Asian merchants in Jackson Heights are riled up over an award-winning pedestrian plaza that they claim is undermining their struggling businesses.<br />They plan to rally on Sunday for the removal of the square on 37th Rd., between 73rd and 74th Sts., in the heart of Queensâ€™ once-bustling Little India. The area is famous for its South Asian grocery, jewelry and clothing shops.<br />â€œCustomers come from tri-state [area\]... to Jackson Heights to shop,â€ said rally organizer Rashid Mohammad. But â€œthe traffic has been made so complicated and so many traffic tickets have been issued that people do not like to come [anymore\].â€<br />The plaza was created last fall following a three-year Jackson Heights transportation study conducted by the city. The project received strong support from the community, prominent local organizations and was backed by City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights).<br />The pedestrian space was also voted best new plaza in the city by the website StreetsBlog.org.<br />But Razi Ahmed, who plans to open a South Asian supermarket and food court in the former Eagle Theater, said local merchants were unaware of the plan.<br />â€œIâ€™m really scared now,â€ said Ahmed, who plans to open the grocery within two months. â€œAll the businesses are dying.â€<br />â€œIt used to be hustle and bustle,â€ he said. â€œNow itâ€™s nothing.â€<br />Shiv Dass, president of the Jackson Heights Indian Merchants Association, said the pedestrian zone led to the loss of about 20 parking spaces â€” another headache for out-of-state drivers coming into a neighborhood known for its lack of spots.<br />Dass voted in favor of creating the plaza at a Community Board 3 meeting last year but has since changed his mind.<br />â€œThe place looks like a graveyard. Thereâ€™s nobody sitting there,â€ he said. â€œGarbage is piling up. ... The homeless people are there.â€<br />Dromm disputed those claims and said the plazaâ€™s been tidy â€” and popular â€” in the community.<br />â€œItâ€™s an area in Jackson Heights thatâ€™s desperate for open space,â€ said Dromm, who met with South Asian business leaders before the plaza was erected. â€œPeople really like having it there.â€<br />He added that the city deemed the corner of 37th Rd. and 73rd St., now part of the plaza, the areaâ€™s most dangerous intersection.<br />â€œIâ€™m asking these merchants to give it a chance,â€ he said. â€œThis can work for everybody involved.â€<br /><br /><br />

				This is all depressing. <br /><br />If the merchants are correct and more stores go under, or don&#039;t open up in the Eagle site,<br />then who is helped?<br /><br />Right now the weather isn&#039;t exactly conducive to sitting outside, but I agree about the garbage that mysteriously<br />arrives anyway.<br /><br />Good luck to the merchants, I say!<br /><br />

				The rally the merchants are planning should really be against all the traffic, congestion and litter the out of town shoppers bring to our neighborhood. The plaza is filthy and needs to be cleaned and greened. Maybe that would help to make it more desirable. I believe that the merchants are short sighted and put greed above having respect for the community as a whole.<br />

				There are a number of statements from that News article that don&#039;t really make much sense.&nbsp; First of all...I realize that parking is an issue around here, but if people are really traveling from out of state to shop here am I to believe that the loss of 20 spots means they drive out, get frustrated and just turn around and go home?? Second, the business owner quoted in the article states that the pedestrian area is both a deserted &quot;ghost town&quot; and filthy with garbage.&nbsp; Well, clearly the garbage didn&#039;t just appear....someone is using the area, so it&#039;s not exactly a ghost town.&nbsp; This pedestrian area is great, it just needs to be fully implemented with more garbage cans, trees and some benches like it&#039;s part of the green streets thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, if that guy opens a supermarket and food court on that block i&#039;ll be eating there regularly.&nbsp;

				The South Asia Store Crawl takes place on the 37th Road Pedestrian Plaza this Sunday at 3 p.m. (Jan. 29)<br />How does it work? Just show up; Walk around; Buy some food, maybe some items that you can use. Sari, anyone? <br /><br />The concept is to support merchants who may be hurting in a poor economy and also support the pedestrian plaza and bus and traffic improvements launched by the city in the fall. <br />You can also let the merchant know you support the plaza. Note: some merchants oppose the plaza, through in meetings they seem most upset by relocation of the bus stop to a new spot which has greatly sped bus service, according to Councilman Dromm&#039;s office.<br /><br />BTW, the owners of Delhi Heights restaurant are big supports the plaza. The plaza is on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th Streets.

				NY1 has a report on the plaza:&nbsp; http://queens.ny1.com/content/top_stories/155121/jackson-heights-merchants-say-pedestrian-plaza-harms-their-business<br />This plaza is an eyesore and badly planned. Apparently, they are still deciding whether or not to make it permanent, but unless they make it an official greenspace with planters, trees, and real tables like they do in the Manhattan&#039;s greenspaces, it will remain a dumping ground for trash and the local bum&#039;s hangout. Jackson Heights could really use some true greenspace and if implemented the right way, businesses would see commerce increase.&nbsp; I really hope the city and the business owners give it a real chance.

				The city only does major landscaping job after plazas become permanent. That&#039;s how plazas are handled cross the city. Government can&#039;t afford to do major changes in the first round - and then rip them out if plazas don&#039;t work.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the plaza there. Could be center for South Asian restaurants in area - with sidewalk cafes, plenty of green - and perhaps appropriate entertainment. That&#039;s why head of South Asian business group voted yes - before later changing his mind. Better had he raised some of these issues so they could have been addressed instead of just going along.<br /><br />Given the extensive community outreach, I think the city did a good job planning the plaza. My only gripe is that they didn&#039;t run the test in spring and summer when it would have been more heavily used. Just because it isn&#039;t working, however, isn&#039;t necessarily the city&#039;s fault. It was a test and sometimes project don&#039;t make the grade.<br /><br />In any case we hope the changes to bus service and the traffic safety remain. <br /><br />Len

				So does every greenspace in Manhattan go through this ugly period before major landscaping is done? &nbsp;Does that mean that greenspaces like 23rd Street in Madison Square Park got big boulders and a just a few tables first to test it out? &nbsp;I admit I don&#039;t know much about what goes into these things, but I just don&#039;t see anything about the plaza that would actually encourage one to make it a destination point. I just think it really needs some work in order to get people to want to use it. &nbsp;The good intentions are there but it&#039;s just not going to work if it&#039;s not an inviting place to be. &nbsp;I yearn for public greenspace here. &nbsp;You&#039;d think with all the coop gardens around that there would be some, but as yet, I haven&#039;t found any. &nbsp;I don&#039;t own property, so I seem to miss out on anything green here.

				I don&#039;t remember the details of 23rd Street, but I recall that Times Square got a bunch of aluminum and plastic folding chairs.<br /><br />We agree completely with you on the lack of open space being a problem in Jackson Heights. Several years ago we unearthed the figure showing that we rank 49th out of 51 City Council Districts in the amount of park space here. The last district, on Manhattan&#039;s East Side, has Central Park across the street so no tears for them.<br /><br />If you are interested in this issue, check out the Green Agenda for Jackson Heights on Facebook, or google for our webpage. And then contact us. We are working hard to get more open space for JH and make it a greener place. That&#039;s why we went to 37th Road on Sunday.<br /><br />All the best.

I could find the census stat, but it&#039;s a very small number. The vast majority of residents - especially living south of Northern Boulevard - rely on public transportation.<br /><br />The issue is that the Indian shopping district, especially over the past 10 years, has grown to depend on non-resident shopping. Many of these shoppers are families who used to live in Jackson Heights (say, in the 80s) but &quot;moved on up&quot; to Richmond Hill, southeast Queens or Nassau County. They drive back to Jackson Heights via the BQE exclusively to load up on supplies, then drive out. Unfortunately, to redesign the neighborhood to cater to these nonresident shoppers would involve blowing up a couple of blocks&#039; worth of apartment buildings to turn them into parking lots.

				If you support the plaza contact Councilman Danny Dromm&#039;s office and let them know. Our councilman wants to make this work. You can also contact NYS Department of Transportation to support this.<br /><br />We, JHBG/The Green Agenda for Jackson Heights, will be looking into the process for a final decision, whether there will be another public hearing, etc. <br />We will post the info here, but a better venue to stay on top of this would be to &quot;like&quot; the Green Agenda for Jackson Heights on Facebook.<br /><br />BTW, we just posted there about getting a permit from the state which will allow us to start our community composting center.

				Finally got to see the pedestrian plaza and have to say that I absolutely love and support it. I didn&#039;t find it to be too dirty either. It is an incredible improvement from the traffic and filth that was there before. Yes. It needs more trees and green. I have to say that I&nbsp; also think this is a great opportunity for business.

				I&#039;m sympathetic to the merchants, but when you read the WSJ opinion piece and Streetsblog you have to wonder if the merchants are not short sighted and suffering from a lack of leadership. Mr. Das the head of a merchants group there approved the traffic changes including the pedestrian plaza on 37th Road and voted for it on the Community Board. He missed an opportunity to make suggestions along the lines of what the city is now considering to deal with some of the merchants&#039; problems. <br />&nbsp;<br />This lack of vision leaves the merchants dependent on a business model that is not particularly sustainable. They seem more worried about business from the suburbs than Jackson Heights and NYC&#039;s transit-oreinted neighborhoods. At some point, someone will buy a failing mall near a highway and turn it into a South Asian shopping center far more convenient to suburbanites and the JH stores will lose a lot of business.<br /><br />Meanwhile we are left with these shoppers endlessly circling the block, waiting for a parking space to open up - polluting the air, honking horns and congesting streets. <br /><br />There&#039;ll be more on the saga of the 37th Road Pedestrian Plaza in JHBG&#039;s &quot;Views from the Heights&quot; newsletter. Print and online versions should be available in mid-March.<br /><br />Len Maniace<br /><br />

				Jeff is certainly on to something... when there are simply too many competitors in one small area, business is bound to suffer for all.&nbsp; Honestly, how many stores selling near-identical products can survive in a three-square-block area?<br /><br />Here are the comments I made in response to the Wall Street Journal piece:<br /><br />The dangerous traffic conditions that residents have suffered with for many years have been ameliorated, thanks to the changes made by the Department of Transporation. For example, rationalizing how buses navigate the local streets so that they now go directly to the Victor Moore Arcade bus station has been very successful. A key component of the DOT study was to reduce the number of ways drivers could turn along Broadway, Roosevelt Avenue, 73 and 74 Streets - all adjacent to 37 Road. This resulted in the closure of 37 Road, and thereby the creation of the plaza. The new traffic patterns are, in fact, now simpler, well marked, and helpful to both drivers and pedestrians. This has also resulted in fewer accidents and safer pedestrians (both shoppers and residents making their way to the subway). Shoppers coming to this section of Jackson heights can always use public transportation - there are 5 subway lines and 6 buses right there - if they find the new traffic pattern too challenging. Finally I doubt that the sole cause of a slowing business environment is the closure of 37 Road. That simply does not make sense, nor does it ring true. Why a perfectly good landmark-worthy art-deco theatre that had shown well received Bollywood films was destroyed for a new grocery store, when there are three major competitors within one block - Patel Brothers, Subzi Mandi, and Apna Bazaar - along with numerous smaller ones, also defies business logic. I am sure most residents would concur on all of these counts.<br /><br />

				Good points on traffic, jhlifer. And yes, the economy is bad all over - 37th Avenue is dotted with closed stores. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure about comments on the supermarkets and the theater.<br />Apparently there&#039;s demand for three supermarkets. None were among those&nbsp; complaining about a downturn in business. Whether there will be demand for a fourth is another question.<br /><br />And if there was good money to be made with movies, the theater would ahve remained open right until the owner found another use ready to go in. There probably isn&#039;t a huge demand for Bollywood movies locally and the suburban shoppers want to get their supplies and get home. We&#039;re not talking about a commercial district whose merchants have added ANY amenities to make people want to be there. <br />

				The New York Times<br /><br />March 18, 2012<br />Traffic-Free Plaza Roils Little India in Queens<br />By SARAH MASLIN NIR<br /><br />The new pedestrian plaza on 37th Road in Jackson Heights, in the heart of Little India, is an oasis of calm, a much-needed stretch of open space in a traffic-glutted area of Queens. Or, it is a glaring example of disastrous city planning, a blighted, unlovely esplanade that has all but decimated commerce in the neighborhood.<br /><br />It depends on whom you ask.<br /><br />Last September, in efforts to create more open space and decongest nearby Roosevelt Avenue, the city repurposed one block of the road â€” much as the Bloomberg administration has reinvented chunks of Times Square â€” to be a haven for pedestrians.<br /><br />But the plaza bears little resemblance to Times Square, just six miles away. A half-dozen traffic-blocking boulders and rickety picnic tables seem to be the sum total of the alterations to the streetscape to date, but business owners say it has been enough to turn a once-bustling block into a barren one.<br /><br />In the coming days, the plaza will be tweaked: parking spots will be added and a tributary road rerouted, among other things. But still the community remains divided between merchants and residents, who see the plaza, between 73rd and 74th Streets, as a boon for a park-starved populace.<br /><br />â€œThis is a business place, this is not Times Square where people come from all of the world and sit there,â€ said Javed Chaudhry, who sells phone cards and accessories at GRB Distributors. He recalled feeling a mounting dread as the boulders rolled in. â€œI knew I was going to lose my bread and butter,â€ he said.<br /><br />Without car traffic or the Q47 and Q49 buses that used to stop on the block, many merchants claim business has fallen by at least half. Park advocates say the recession is more to blame. But even during the economyâ€™s darkest days, says Raj Bhalla, who sells cellphones, Jackson Heights was largely spared, because of the bustling business of East Asian people drawn here for products from their homelands.<br /><br />Councilman Daniel Dromm, a Democrat who had pushed for the plaza, said he believed the business owners were overstating the impact, and he challenged the merchants to turn over their books and prove their losses. No one has done so.<br /><br />Even if the business community were to prove its claim, Mr. Dromm said, the plaza would most likely stay.<br /><br />The plaza was created after an 18-month study of safety and congestion in Jackson Heights by the cityâ€™s Transportation Department, said Seth Solomonow, a department spokesman. No cost estimate is available, he said: the boulders, tables and paint were already on hand. It broke ground after unanimous resolutions by Community Boards 3 and 4.<br /><br />â€œThey didnâ€™t ask me anything; nobody knew,â€ said Abdul Karim, who manages the Jackson Heights Music Center on 37th Road. â€œThey just came. They closed the street.â€<br /><br />Mr. Dromm said that he tried to reach out to business owners but that he was dismissed.<br /><br />Nooruddin Dashti owns two jewelry shops on the road. Since the closing in September, he says, he was forced to reduce hours at his newest shop after firing all but one of his employees because he could no longer pay them.<br /><br />Little Indiaâ€™s customer base, the merchants argue, is not foot traffic. Destination shoppers come here for Nepalese, Indian and Bangladeshi goods. The closing ate up parking spots, merchants say, and made streets unnavigable.<br /><br />Some passers-by, however, enjoy it. â€œWe like it, itâ€™s nice, itâ€™s kind of less crowded, otherwise youâ€™d see a lot of vehicles coming from here, there, you never know,â€ said Karsang Dawa, who lives nearby in Woodside. â€œBut itâ€™s very dirty, thatâ€™s a problem.â€<br /><br />Mr. Dashti says he has been fined by the Sanitation Department for picnickersâ€™ litter. On a recent Thursday, piles of garbage spilled from trash bags on the tables and lumped in the street, next to boxes and a broken television. Cigarette butts eddied in the gutters. Workers from the Doe Fund now clean multiple times a day, says Mr. Dromm, who spent $42,500 from his discretionary fund on sanitation there.<br /><br />On a sunny morning in early March, the street was nearly empty. A few men slept at the blue picnic tables, more than one emitting a scent that made sharing a table impossible. The lounging men have become a fixture since the street closed, people who live nearby said.<br /><br />One man, who gave his name only as Derek, said he began hanging out on the block as soon as the street was closed. â€œRather than be on an avenue that is all active and engines flowing here and going there,â€ said Derek, as he paced back and forth unsteadily, â€œitâ€™s calm and tranquil.â€<br /><br />Perhaps too calm and tranquil, says Mr. Chaudhry, the phone-card salesman. â€œEither this park is going to be here,â€ he says, â€œor weâ€™re going to be here.â€<br /><br />

				i could understand the merchants&#039; complaints a little more if these businesses sold products that actually required catering to vehicular traffic. i have to wonder how many people specifically drive in from westchester or new jersey to buy a phone card from a specific vendor -- rather than go to one of the 3,722 others in jackson heights -- or the 1100 or so in the edison area.<br /><br />there&#039;s not a single vendor on 37th road -- as far as i can think of -- that would seem to need a loading zone or a parking space directly in front of its doors. anyone have one in mind that might?

				I think it&#039;s funny that Ms. Nir tweeted about Fox News doing &quot;her story.&quot; The NY Daily News and other local outlets have been covering the controversy over the pedestrian plaza for months. I&#039;ve noticed that attitude in other NYT reporters too-- i.e., this story didn&#039;t exist until the Times wrote about it.

				As someone who has lived in Jackson Heights for several years, I am not park-starved and I certainly didn&#039;t move here with the idea that the city owed me any green space (Flushing Meadow Park will do just fine). Noone in my building would be caught dead in that pedestrian plaza. Its filth is only matched by the unsavory characters who lurk about there day and night. Mr. Dromm&#039;s assumption that the merchants of 37th Road have something to hide is by far the most troubling aspect of that NYTimes piece. Why would anyone in their right mind open their financial records to a total megalomaniac?! And why would anyone expect the head of the 74th Street business association to inform merchants on 37th Road of the impending pedestrian plaza? Their failure just sends more business his way. Unfortunately,&nbsp; Sarah Maslin Nir didn&#039;t ask the really tough questions like (1) how coincidental is it that the economic downturn that hit 37th Road started on Sept. 20th--the very day the street was closed to vehicular traffic; (2) why isn&#039;t anyone asking the DOT to open their books and show us all exaclty how they spent over $650,000; (3) after repeatedly saying &quot;give it a chance&quot; in the press, when is Danny Dromm going to realize that after 6 months, the plaza continues to be a failure. Being so stubbornly inflexible and refusing to listen to reason only reinforces my image of him as a whiny kid, stamping his feet and leaving nothing but useless dust in his wake.

				I couldn&#039;t disagree more.&nbsp; There is no question in my mind that Dromm has the best interests of the commercial district in mind when he asks the merchants to give the plaza more time and approach the issue with an open mind.&nbsp; To be frank, the merchants&#039; constantly evolving complaint and their focus on red herring issues (such as the notion that the homeless appeared in the area only after the plaza was put in place), raises questions about whether their claims can be taken seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, Streetsblog ran a great take-down of Sarah Maslin Nir&#039;s article.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know if she or her editors were to blame for running with the photo they did (presumably it was the editors), but it was a lazy and sloppy choice.<br />http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/03/19/the-jackson-heights-plaza-photo-the-times-doesnt-want-you-to-see/

				Thank you.&nbsp; I was so perturbed&nbsp; when I read the post prior to yours toddg. It is unconscionable that someone would subvert the truth like that. The fact of the matter is that since they set up the pedestrian plaza there has been a 200 percent improvement. While no where perfect, it is a&nbsp; world apart from the filth, cacophony, and pollution that exited there before.&nbsp; I can&#039;t fathom&nbsp; anyone NOT wanting open space void of that. It&#039;s a win win situation for the merchants and the neighborhood.&nbsp; I applaud Daniel Dromm and all that he has done to improve the quality of life for all of us in Jackson Heights. I think he has been the only elected official who has actively initiated positive change in a long time.

				In my opinion, the merchants approval will turn on a dime when the first one of them actually markets to the traffic coming through there.<br />You could do a fine business if you understood what someone might want while sitting outdoors awhile on 37th Road in Jackson Heights. <br />And then this conversation will completely change. In the same way that the first successful food cart has attracted a dozen or more here<br />there will be one leading entrepreneur, or local innovator, who will show the other business people how to make a profit. And then there <br />will be competition and fighting about this as well as the improvements in the design and greenery that are scheduled to appear.<br />&nbsp;Hopefully, Kebab King or Delhi Heights will use the opportunity that has been handed to them on a platter to make 37th Road a street food <br />destination here in Jackson Heights.

				The city has implemented some steps to address the merchants&#039; concerns.&nbsp; Today, the city reversed the direction of 37th Road east of 74th Street.&nbsp; This helps in two key ways:<br /><br />First, it enables the city to remove the one-block bike lane that it had added to 37th Road for safety reasons, and replace it with parking.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any official estimates, but I&#039;d bet that the net result of this change and the implementation of Muni Meters means that the area around 37th Road will now have more parking spaces than it did before any of the changes were made.<br /><br />Second, the reversal of 37th Road creates a clockwise loop for vehicles to circle between 74th Street and 75th Street, without having to venture onto Roosevelt.&nbsp; In a conversation I had with some of the merchants, they cited the loss of the counterclockwise loop between 73rd and 74th Streets as a key reason for their loss of business.&nbsp; (It didn&#039;t make sense to me, but they were convinced that the area became too difficult for out-of-town visitors to navigate, so they stopped coming.&nbsp; &nbsp;They also said this was a more important issue to them than the loss of parking).&nbsp; This new clockwise loop should work better than the old counterclockwise one, because it doesn&#039;t require left turns.<br /><br />Finally, we also got some new planters on the plaza.&nbsp; Nothing beautiful, but every little bit helps!<br /><br />Overall, an important step forward.&nbsp; Here&#039;s hoping the warmer weather is making things easier on the merchants.

				Thumbs up on the planters.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much needed and I&#039;m happy they put them in.&nbsp; It does wonders.&nbsp; Looking forward to the rest of the cosmetic enhancements.&nbsp; This area seriously needs real greenspace, rather than concrete greenspace.<br /><br />A Columbian chicken spot on 37th Ave around 78th Street or so put up a garden in front of his shop yesterday - it&#039;s so nice!&nbsp; Full of flowers and cuteness.&nbsp; I love it when local shop owners take an initiative to beautify the street.&nbsp; It&#039;s so pretty here in the spring time.&nbsp; I am so jealous of property owners who have gardens to sit in.&nbsp; What I would do to have that.&nbsp; There&#039;s supposedly a new park coming in near Travers but from what it sounds like, it&#039;ll likely be a park of the sport and playground variety.

				Planters, finally!! They have hardy shrubs mostly in them now. Maybe some annual flowers will be coming. The way they are arranged is nice and<br />if the tables were improved, this place will really be swell. I will say that the vendors seem to be benefiting more than the restaurant owners but<br />if Kebab King and Delhi Heights were to put out sidewalk seating and service, they would do a fantastic business in my opinion. It may spawn a<br />new group of sidewalk cafes which I would love to have here in Jackson Heights.

				the jackson heights neighborhood alliance issued a press release on the 37th road plaza that, in my opinion, was anything but factual. <br />&quot;On Thursday, April 5, the Department of Transportation (DOT), 6 months after the temporary plaza was launched on September 20, 2011, moved to make the plaza, which has destroyed the peaceful atmosphere of the immediate area and damaged the businesses of local merchants, permanent by installing flower pots and making other minor modifications.&nbsp; The broad opposition to the plaza apparently was no obstacle to the Council Member and the DOT in their desire to transform this ethnically diverse community which was bustling and safe into a hangout for petty thieves, drunken homeless and loitering gangs, thus choking off the economic vitality of the area, with businesses, jobs and revenue being lost each day the street was closed, as well as making the quality-of-life miserable for many.&quot;<br />They claim to be &quot;a coalition of residents and merchants who were suffering under the presence of the pedestrian plaza.&quot;, but list no names!&nbsp; Anyone know who is heading up this group?

				It was a great meeting tonight. &nbsp;I didn&#039;t get a head count, but the JCJH was packed to capacity. <br /><br />The coalition of aggrieved 37th Road businesses and 75th Street residents was there and was quite vocal. &nbsp;They made their presence felt with some sharp questioning and a few outbursts, but they were significantly outnumbered by supporters of the plaza and other transportation improvements. &nbsp;When Dromm made his pitch for the types of transportation and livability improvements he was trying to bring to the neighborhood, the crowd broke out into loud and sustained applause. &nbsp;<br /><br />In general, Dromm and Crowley divided up the questions so that Dromm answered the questions about local issues and Crowley answered the questions about federal issues. &nbsp;But I was quite pleased that when Crowley was pressed on the plaza controversy, he didn&#039;t distance himself from it, as he easily could have. &nbsp;Instead, he reminded the audience that he was the one who secured the federal grant for the study, and that he had done so because the neighborhood had been looking for solutions to its chronic traffic problems. &nbsp;I thought this was a lot more helpful on this issue than I expected him to be.<br /><br />At the end of the meeting, a representative from the JH Green Alliance read a very nicely written statement in support of the plaza. &nbsp;He said that while the Green Alliance wasn&#039;t involved in asking for the plaza and the transportation changes, they recognized that the city had made these changes after an extensive public process -- and that opponents&#039; claims to the contrary were damaging efforts to build civic engagement and ensure that public agencies are accountable to the demands of the community. &nbsp; It made a number of excellent points. &nbsp;Hopefully somebody from the Green Alliance can post the statement here.

				I missed the end. was the man who spoke on the 75th behalf the mustachioed one in the suit? The way he was talking, it seemed like he was a lawyer straight out of 80s Chicago.

				Jeff: Yes, he was the guy who spoke.&nbsp; After Dromm pointed out in passing that he didn&#039;t live in the neighborhood, he started huffing about his right to speak, instead of just making the point he wanted to make.<br /><br />I think both the residents&#039; group and the business group are playing this very poorly.&nbsp; Dromm and NYCDOT have been very patient and open to constructive proposals.&nbsp; But instead of engaging constructively, both groups continue to peddle obvious lies and exaggerations.&nbsp; They are squandering their credibility and their ability to sway still unformed public opinion on this issue.

				The following is Jackson Heights Green Alliance&#039;s official statement on the issue.&nbsp; I read an earlier version of this at the meeting.<br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS GREEN ALLIANCE<br /><br />STATEMENT ON 37TH ROAD PUBLIC PLAZA IN JACKSON HEIGHTS<br /><br />The 37th Road Public Plaza is the product of a sound idea and perhaps less-than-perfect execution, whose success is nevertheless already visible and will become even more obvious with time.&nbsp; We wish to emphasize that, while this project is not of our making, the Jackson Heights Green Alliance fully supports it.<br /><br />The claim has been made that the 37th Road Public Plaza initiative is being rammed down the throats of the community with no public meetings or input.&nbsp; We find this claim not only unfounded and untrue, but destructive to the community dialogue.&nbsp; This was a road, and therefore under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT).&nbsp; <br /><br />The decision to convert it to a plaza was a direct outcome of the DOTâ€™s Jackson Heights Transportation Plan which was years in the making and included a robust public involvement process â€“ with walkthroughs, open houses, public workshops, and several community board meetings.&nbsp; Our members have attended many of the workshops, having come across flyers for them posted around the neighborhood.&nbsp; The claim that the plaza had no public process is false and inflammatory, and we wish those who are making it would, for the benefit of honest, civil community dialogue, stop.<br /><br />As to the merits of the plaza itself, the claim is also being made that it has resulted in increased vagrancy, gangs, trash, and a drastic drop in business. We think this characterization is unfortunate in a neighborhood that prides itself on its diversity.&nbsp; And, with regard to this last claim, it is our understanding that no data has been offered to support it; therefore, the rest of the community is being asked to simply take their word for it.&nbsp; As local residents who have observed the plaza countless times and at all times of day, all we can say is that we, again, are troubled by this claim, as 37th Road appears to us more busy and vital than ever.<br /><br />Jackson Heights has one of the lowest percentages of open space in the city, and for that reason, the Jackson Heights Green Alliance has successfully advocated for the 78th Street Play Street, which is also becoming a plaza this year.&nbsp; The key to a successful plaza is that it must be used, and therefore it is helpful if it is located near to other activity.&nbsp; In that case, we have Travers Park.&nbsp; But, in many ways, 37th Road is even more fortunate in its location, nestled between the busy 73rd and 74th Streets, and the second busiest subway station in Queens.&nbsp; It is, by far, the busiest pedestrian location in the entire neighborhood.<br /><br />There was a lot of doubt and skepticism when the Times Square plaza was established, but a recent article in the Times Real Estate section said that the end result has been to render the retail there some of the most valuable in the whole city.<br /><br />Regressing to the point of allowing motor vehicles back on the 180-foot stump of public space that was 37th Road, in this heavy pedestrian center, would make no sense.<br /><br />In summary, a lot of claims are being made with very little â€“ or in some cases contrary â€“ data in evidence.&nbsp; Jackson Heights needs open space, and 37th Road is an excellent location for some of that open space.&nbsp; To many of us, this is an experiment that is working.&nbsp; But we suggest that whatever decision gets made be made on actual verifiable data, and not just on a lot of claims, however passionately or frequently stated.<br /><br />###&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Green Alliance is an entirely volunteer-run 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded in 2007. Our mission is to expand, protect, and promote open space in Jackson Heights, New York. Our recent successful initiatives include the award-winning 78th Street Play Street and the Grow A Park campaign to expand Travers Park. For more information, visit our website: www.jhgreen.org

				I wonder how many members of the J.H. Green Alliance ever spent a dime in any of the businesses on 37th Road. As long as you continue to never put your money where your mouth is, your opinion is worthless. It&#039;s also unfortunate that you actually believe the bunk Danny Dromm spoons out. No one in that Town Hall meeting asked for the Transportation Study to be reversed. They asked for it to be reviewed for alternatives.

				Seriously, the Little India section of JH is very popular for both South Asians and persons of other ethnicities, bot local and visitors. I believe it would be MORE popular if it was maintained in better order by shop owners.&nbsp; I know I would be more encouraged to shop there. Shopkeepers: are you listening, for once?!!<br /><br />I have my own complaints about JH, but Dan Dromm has been a consistent advocate for everyone who lives here. I am stunned by how tireless he is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it first-hand and I&#039;ve seen it repeatedly.&nbsp; I am no push-over (as you suggest those of us who support Dan Dromm are) but I am sorry to see that you are disatisfied with someone who actually accomplishes things for JH.&nbsp; But this is your opinion and I&#039;m sure you have your reasons for having it.

				Yes, anyone who shops on 37th Road is entitled to an opinion. If you don&#039;t mind having to step over piles of garbage or share your plaza table with people who are simply loitering or sleeping or intoxicated, then so be it.<br /><br />To the other know-it-alls, I respond with the following:<br /><br />-the merchants did ask to have the plaza removed from its current location and placed on 37th Road between 75th and 76th Streets instead<br /><br />-the merchants did ask to have the Q47 and Q49 bus stops returned to the 37th Road, BUT they did NOT ask to have the buses returned to 73rd St (the obvious route should be on 35th Avenue and Broadway since these are two double lane roads that would allow for emergency and delivery vehicles to stop in front of buildings/businesses without creating a traffic jam; NOTE that this is the same route used when 37th Avenue is closed for parades)

Sometimes the place on 37th Road has Russian Standard and Cuervo at a better price than the place up at 37th Avenue and 75th Street. I also commute using that subway entrance, and last year I used to take the Q49 bus to the subway, so that makes me kind of a trifecta.<br /><br />It had always puzzled me why the bus stops were on 37th Road. With the buses idling there, it tended to make that block loud and noxious, and there was a little bit of &quot;Frogger&quot; traffic dodging to get across the street to the subway entrance. Also, the new 74th Street subway station has that really convenient bus terminal built right into it, and the main entrance to the subway station has more gates and more walking room than the 37th Road entrance does, which means it&#039;s better for handling a bus-full of traffic. It&#039;s also easier to get up to the 7 from the main entrance, with wider staircases. So for the bus commuters, parking the buses at the main subway terminal rather than the 37th Road entrance makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />Meanwhile, now that the buses aren&#039;t dumping into the 37th Road entrance, we don&#039;t get that crazy clog when a busload of people are trying to go down the two narrow-ish staircases in the morning. It&#039;s far from deserted - there&#039;s a steady flow of people in and out of the station at that entrance - but the passenger load is much more appropriate for the size of the entrance and staircases.

				I think you hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; For some crazy reason, some of these business owners think that we owe them tribute or something for creating such an amazing destination.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even seen it opined&nbsp; (in comments to an article) that 37rd Road&nbsp; put Jackson Heights on the map.&nbsp; Seriously there are many contributions this retail area made to JH, but it is by no means the reason I moved here.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has an illustrous history, beautiful architecture and yes, a diverse population.&nbsp; I&#039;m tired of the inflated entitlement of these merchants.&nbsp; <br />They refuse to take responsibility for the fact that well, I&#039;ll say it, maybe 37 Road isn&#039;t all that. They can choose to participate or not, but they don&#039;t make the rules for a public street.

Although there were four people in the audience who held up signs opposing the implementation of the plaza (including former City Council candidate David Rosasco from Woodside), there was an extended round of applause after Dromm explained why the plaza was installed in the first place.<br /><br />The 37th Road Public Plaza is a result of the federally-funded Jackson Heights Transportation Study. The city Department of Transportation conducted an in-depth, three-year study at the request of community leaders and elected officials to identify ways to improve pedestrian safety, reduce traffic congestion, and minimize noise and air pollution.<br /><br />â€œI was elected in 2009 to the City Council with a mandate to improve the quality of life of residents,â€ said Dromm. â€œThe two top concerns I heard repeatedly during my campaign were that traffic congestion in the lower 70s section of Jackson Heights was making life unbearable for residents, and that the community has a need and desire for more open space. The public plaza on 37th Road presents an opportunity to address both of these concerns.â€<br /><br />Dromm showed pictures of how well the plaza is being used and spoke about the critical need for economic development in the area. Despite being interrupted several times by the four opponents of the plaza, Dromm continued to talk at length about unlocking its potential and making sure that the retail stores in the neighborhood are thriving places to do business.<br /><br />Crowley and Dromm took questions from the audience for nearly two hours and addressed a wide range of federal and local issues including health care, sanitation and redistricting.<br /><br />With a small contingent of people outside the Jewish Center protesting Crowleyâ€™s vote on a free trade agreement with Colombia, the congressmember also took time to explain his vote and speak about the importance of engaging one of our countryâ€™s strongest supporters in Latin America.

				It&#039;s gratifying to see the changes being implemented at the plaza. It&#039;s swept and spritzed and used regularly and the planters are a nice addition. It&#039;s so satisfying that city officials have paid attention to the people! Donald Dromm seems to be a good guy.

				Delhi Heights Looks to Open Sidewalk Cafe in Pedestrian Plaza<br />By Smriti Rao 5/7/12<br /><br />(http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/05/1336403699.jpg/image320x240.jpg)<br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS â€” Popular Jackson Heights restaurant Delhi Heights wants to open a sidewalk cafe this summer, making it the first eatery to do so along a busy commerical stretch.<br /><br />Delhi Heights is getting its paperwork together to apply for the permit to serve food on the sidewalk in the new pedestrian plaza at 73rd and 74th streets on 37th Road, owner Mohan Baruwa told DNAinfo.com New York.<br /><br />â€œWe have a lot of people coming to the plaza now,â€ said manager Suman Oli.&nbsp; â€œWe wanted to make the most of our sidewalk outside.â€<br /><br />The pedestrian plaza opened last fall and has been controversial ever since. Many local merchants complain that the plaza has led to traffic congestion problems in the area, and led to a drop in business.<br /><br />But people who live and work in the area were excited for the sidewalk cafe. <br /><br />â€œI think the sidewalk cafÃ© is a great idea,â€ restaurant worker Shipan Dey said in Hindi.<br /><br />Restaurant worker Raju Rama, who spends his day off hanging out with friends at the plaza, was equally enthusiastic about a new cafÃ© nearby.<br /><br />â€œIt should be clean and cheap, only then people will come,â€ he said, adding, â€œAnd the food should be tasty.â€<br /><br />(http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/05/1336403869.jpg/image640x480.jpg)<br /><br />(http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2012/05/1336404118.jpg/image640x480.jpg)<br /><br />Read more: http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120507/jackson-heights/delhi-heights-looks-open-sidewalk-cafe-pedestrian-plaza#ixzz1uOoB8OyS (http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120507/jackson-heights/delhi-heights-looks-open-sidewalk-cafe-pedestrian-plaza#ixzz1uOoB8OyS)

Benches, like they have in front of the post office, would be great. I think the problem might be balancing seating on the concave asphalt. Remember when the tables used to be off to the side? They were wobbly. More centered, they seem to work better. This might be a problem they need to overcome, but benches on the street-side of the sidewalk might work.

				finally! maybe an end to the madness.<br /><br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/33/plazareconciled_at_2012_08_16_q.html<br /><br />In a capstone to a nearly yearlong fight, City Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) and business owners in Jackson Heights announced Friday the controversy around the 37th Road Plaza was essentially over now that the businesses have created an organization to care for the space.<br /><br />â€œI have looked forward to this day coming for a very long time,â€ Dromm said.<br /><br />Business owners Agha Saleh and Shazia Kausar instituted the new group, Sukhi NY. The organization, the name of which means â€œprosperity and happinessâ€ in Hindi, aims to both work with the city Department of Transportation to improve the quality of life in the plaza and hold events there to bring the diverse populations of Jackson Heights together.<br /><br />â€œThis is the best solution,â€ said Kausar, who is president of the organization and owns the cafÃ© Bombay Chat. â€œWe will make this plaza beautiful and more people will come.â€<br /><br />Following the findings of a transportation study for Jackson Heights and with the approval of Community Board 3, the city DOT installed a plaza on 37th Road between 73rd and 74th streets in October. After 37th Road was closed, many business owners said they experienced large drops in their sales and witnessed an increase in vagrancy. They raised their problems at multiple meetings with the DOT and members of CB 3.<br /><br />As the weather became warmer, however, more shoppers and residents began to use the plaza. Sukhi hopes to keep the momentum going by using the plaza as a place to hold events.<br /><br />From Thursday, Aug. 16, to Monday, Aug. 20, Sukhi will hold a Chaand Raat Festival/Eid Baazar to celebrate the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.<br /><br />â€œYou will see this street further transformed into a beautiful area in honor of those holidays,â€ Dromm said.<br /><br />Both Shiv Dass, president of the Jackson Heights Merchants Association, and Mohammad Peer, of the Bangladeshi Merchants Association, said they were glad a compromise had been reached.<br /><br />â€œThis is a great day,â€ Peer said. â€œAfter months of misunderstanding, we have restored our differences.â€<br /><br />Dromm said he believed a solution was able to be reached because throughout the debate the lines of communication were kept open between those who opposed the plaza and those who were for it. He encouraged all residents, even non-Muslims, to take part in the Eid celebration and enjoy the diverse community.<br /><br />â€œWe are all in this together, and as Agha said, we are all Americans,â€ Dromm said. â€œThis is our neighborhood. These are all our shops.â€<br /><br />Reach reporter Rebecca Henely by e-mail at rhenely@cnglocal.com or by phone at 718-260-4564.<br /><br />

				While the better weather has certainly helped, along with ongoing discussions, I think that the merchants may have finally realized that the real issue (beyond the overall weak economy that we have all suffered through) is not the plaza, but competition from other ethnic shopping enclaves in the NYC metropolitan area.&nbsp; The Wall Street Journal recently profiled a new south asian shopping area in Nassau Country, with parking and other amenities.&nbsp; There are similar shopping districts in New Jersey, and I am sure some can be found in Westchester and Connecticut.&nbsp; If our local merchants continue to solely rely on shoppers from outside the borough (or those without access to public transportation), business will remain challenging&nbsp; - not because of a one-block plaza, but because of new shopping options and an oversaturation of similar stores.&nbsp; <br /><br />The level of competition is so high - multiple gold stores, large supermarkets - on just a handful of blocks, that Marketing 101 would indicate that opening another gold store or food market will more likely take business away from already existing stores and further weaken sales.&nbsp; Appealing to non-south-asian customers and local residents might end up being a wiser strategy in the long term.&nbsp; Plus cleaning and beautifying the shopping district can only attract more business.

				cleaning would be a huge plus. the merchants on 37th are out there constantly sweeping and cleaning. maybe they get ticketed more often?<br /><br />there needs to be co-operation among the business owners, though: if buildings A and C clean their walkways hourly and building B lets grot build up, it&#039;s a losing battle.

				I know that Dan Dromm has tried to have some public education projects re not littering, merchants cleaning up sidewalks etc. but there&#039;s got to be a better way. The old &quot;not enough garbage cans&quot; or the garbage cans are full doesn&#039;t cut it with me. If the garbage can is full carry people should carry refuse to their next destination where it can be properly disposed of.&nbsp; I don&#039;t drop my waste on the street when I&#039;m walking my dog, I carry with me until I find a can. It can and should be done.&nbsp; People need to grow up and take care of their environments, even urban ones.

				I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. People have said this over and over again but the only real way to clean up the streets is law&nbsp; enforcement. If you get a ticket, then you&#039;ll be &quot;educated&quot; not to do it again. This should also apply to the store owners who never clean up&nbsp; in front of their stores. They should be setting the example.I hope that Daniel Dromm is able to make a positive impact by getting more enforcement in the area.

				I wonder if it ever occurs to community leaders to suggest diversity in retail, not just in people.&nbsp; The repetition of stores in JH is a part of it&#039;s curse and downfall. It might work in SA or Bangladesh, but with our high rents, you have to stand out in order to attract enough customers.

				Trust me, what community leaders think or say will likely have little if any influence on individual business decisions.&nbsp; Also, the opinions of some outsiders will not likely be welcomed.&nbsp; Unfortunately it will be business failures that finally convince the next merchant to try something different.<br /><br />The owners of commercial buildings have a big say regarding their tenants.&nbsp; For example, commercial leases can stipulate that no direct competitor be leased within the same building.&nbsp; But there is nothing preventing a tenant from renting in another building across the street.&nbsp; That is what we are experiencing.<br /><br />Until our merchants look more carefully at the competitive dynamics of the local area, we will continue to throw up our hands over situations like this.&nbsp; So if they complain again about how bad business is, we know it is not because of a one-block plaza.

				Retail diversity in some contexts makes commercial sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in an urban environment, itâ€™s also fairly common for specialized commercial centers to develop --&nbsp; which become known for particular products/services/cuisines etc.&nbsp; ( i.e. the diamond district in midtown, the plant stores in the East 20s along 6th Ave., various antique districts, many other examples in NYC and elsewhere).&nbsp; &nbsp;In that context, having multiple competing business offering the same or similar products in a small area enhances the overall level of economic activity.&nbsp; Traditional retail diversity -- in the sense of having a florist, a hardware store, hair stylist, a dry clearner&nbsp; etc. -- is a little beside the point in a commercial center of this sort.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The 74th street corridor has plainly become an established commercial center for a number of products (directed predominately though not exclusively to the South Asian community) with seemingly dozens of jewelry shops, sari shops, food vendors and restaurants offering the same or similar products.&nbsp; My guess is that that over the years, the concentration of so many competing businesses has been a boon to the overall level of economic activity and profitability rather than a hindrance.&nbsp; So itâ€™s not really surprising that there would be two Bangladeshi supermarkets within half a block. <br /><br />Not sure what the current state of business is on 74th Street -- although by the number of people going in and out of stores it seems like it is still going strong. Could be wrong, but I kind of doubt there would be a strong business incentive to introduce more retail diversity.&nbsp; <br />

				what you say makes sense - but in the rest of JH, it seems to result in failed businesses. And it&#039;s a drag too, because the majority of these businesses are really uninspiring. I&#039;d love to shop in the neighborhood, I do to the degree possible.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need really expensive high-end stores. There is a new Russian deli on 37th that looks very nice - hope it manages to hang in there for a while before the landlord strangles the life out of it.

				the business failure rate -- in my opinion -- is not a function of lack of diversification. the recent failures on 37th include an old school mini-market, a dry cleaner, a clothing store, rudy volcano (however you&#039;d classify that place) and an indian restaurant.<br /><br />the non-diversified sections -- solid blocks of desi businesses, solid blocks of central and south american&nbsp; 37/restaurants, phone card places, places that afford links to a homeland -- aren&#039;t suffering the same failure rate.<br /><br />frankly, it&#039;s all down to landlords who want to suck every last dollar from tenants -- a proud american tradition. the tiny dry cleaner at 37th and 76th managed to squeak by paying 4500 a month, for a place a little smaller than a typical two bedroom apartment in this neighborhood. they charged relatively high prices, did very nice work .... and had to leave when the LLC in charge wanted another two grand a month.<br /><br />a big crash is coming, and it&#039;s not gonna be pretty.

				Is it called Diversity Plaza now? that&#039;s very interesting...<br /><br />DSSJH, there are still lots of South Asian businesses going out of business. They are just replaced by similar businesses most of the time. <br /><br />The rents are terrible, but how can you blame the landlords for going at market rate?

				http://www.queenstribune.com/2013Weekly/Trib%20Web%20042513/News_042513_VendorsPledgeToKeepCityStreetsClean.html<br /><br /><br />Vendors Pledge To Keep City Streets Clean <br /><br />By Trisha Sakhuja<br /><br />Street vendors joined Councilman Daniel Dromm (D-Jackson Heights) and community leaders to hold a press conference on April 23 to announce a new collaborative project, the Clean Streets Initiative.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Councilman Daniel Dromm joined street vendors in an effort to keep Queens streets clean.<br /><br /><br />“I am proud to endorse the Clean Streets Initiative,” said Dromm. “I have been working with street vendors to improve conditions in our communities for a long time and feel this is a giant step in the right direction to addressing some of the issues concerning street vending.” <br /><br />Some may think street vendors are the cause of dirty street corners, but Agha Saleh, founder of Social Uplift Knowledge and Hope Initiatives (Sukhi New York), feels otherwise. <br /><br />“The street vendors are the bread and butter of the local community. They are real eyes and ears. They don’t liter, instead they use their garbage bins and create a clean space for their customers,” he said. <br /><br />One of the goals of non-profit organization VAMOS Unidos is to advocate street vendor rights. As part of the Clean Street Initiative program, street vendors will place around stickers reading “Clean Streets Initiative” on their carts in Jackson Heights and Corona. The participants will pledge to maintain the area within a 20-foot radius of their carts. The vendor owners will keep their area clean of debris and provide more trash bins if needed. <br /><br />VAMOS Unidos took the lead in the NYC Green Cart program, which introduced 1,000 new green carts to sell fruits and vegetables in underserved areas, and it has proven successful. The organization joined with the Dept. of Health and ally organizations, helping to provide low cost, healthy foods to communities plagued by diseases. <br /><br />“It is these kids of pro-worker, pro-community projects that improve neighborhoods,” said Rafael Samanez, executive director of VAMOS Unidos. “This is a kick-off to unite vendors and turnaround the negative image of vendors in New York City.” <br /><br />VAMOS Unidos plans to expand to other neighborhoods and create a collective effort to keep the streets clean, which in turn will increase business and the livelihood of Queens. <br /><br />“We provide the community with reasonable priced and fresh food,” said Sammy Noor, owner of Sammy’s Halal Food, located on the corner of 73rd Road and Broadway in Jackson Heights. “This program reinforces our pledge to keep our neighborhood clean because we not only work here, but also live here.” <br /><br />Even though VAMOS Unidos initiated this program in response to Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras’(D-East Elmhurst) New Deal Program, which proposes to increase the number of garbage bins and sanitation pickups, as well as install more lighting and video cameras on Roosevelt Avenue; Ferreras’ program does not seek a reduction or removal of street vendors. <br /><br />The 37th Road pedestrian plaza in Jackson Heights has recently emerged as the local gathering place for the community and a central place where holidays from all religions are being celebrated. Last year, businesses were angered by the decrease in traffic and drop in sales, but united efforts from Sukhi NY and VAMOS Unidos changed the mindset of the local businesses. The pedestrian plaza is slowly becoming an advantage to the local businesses because they see an increase in sales, an increase in foot-traffic from nationalities other than Asian Americans and together they strive to keep the area clean. <br /><br />Reach Reporter Trisha Sakhuja at (718-357-4000), Ext. 128, or at tsakhuja@queenstribune.com. <br /><br />More Sharing Services Share | Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on email Share on print<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />HOME

				&nbsp;Here is where I have a problem with the vendors/shop owners behavior vs. their words. Just days ago during <br />the morning rush hour right on 73rd road, I encountered a shopkeeper from the lottery &amp; other items store <br />right next to the subway entrance emptying his smallish trash can into the city garbage cans. In front of <br />streams of people in broad daylight. I questioned him about this and asked if he knew that this was not right<br />as private businesses are by law responsible to pay for private garbage pickup. He shrugged and acted like <br />in a few minutes you will be gone and I will do this a few more times probably even today. Keep emptying <br />my trash into the public bin that always overflows and you, taxpayer and resident, will just have to deal.<br />&nbsp; These are the vendors that are pledging to help the community keep the street clean? What accountability<br />do we have?

				taggie, i agree with your thesis, but it&#039;s no different in JH than park slope, murray hill, woodlawn or tottenville. some business owners are considerate of neighbors, some are, for lack of a better word, pigs.<br /><br />after 17 years in this area, i can say that mobile vendors create less trash than brick and mortar retailers. look down and you&#039;ll see more snapple bottles, chip bags, cigarette packs, candy wrappers and phone cards than leavings from taco trucks or momo carts. we need to target people who sell the former just as much as the latter.<br />with any luck, we can make a dent :)

				I think many people would disagree with you. I lived in the Bronx in a working class/lower income neighborhood for 25 years but I have never dealt with trash on the scale and in the way of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I think until we stop giving bad behavior a pass, we will enable it.&nbsp; I do think that there is not one group that is responsible for all the littering, it is pretty much systemic.
