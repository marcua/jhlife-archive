It&#039;s the part with the scummy green industrial &quot;pond&quot; surrounded by tarmac by the Van Wyck. Yes, I absolutely agree that it would be much nicer to replace that pond with beautiful green space, but that&#039;s not one of the available options. The question is what they&#039;d do with the existing soccer fields, which should absolutely be monitored.<br /><br />Using Citi Field isn&#039;t an option in part because, according to soccer fan sites, teams in shared stadiums don&#039;t draw nearly as many fans; there would be various other scheduling and landscaping issues. Baseball stadia are used much more heavily than other sports&#039; stadia, and Citi Field is also too big for soccer; it would look perpetually empty, leading to a vicious cycle of disappointment.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_45303"><strong>DAILY NEWS: SOCCER STADIUM PROPOSED <br /><br />MLS executives and pols are pushing for arena in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, <br /><br />but deal is a long way from done.</strong><br /><br /><br />Queens has a big appetite for world-class soccer - and ticket demand for Wednesday&#039;s Chile-Ecuador friendly at Citi Field is proof - but can the borough support a Major League Soccer franchise and a $300-million stadium?<br /><br />MLS executives and elected officials who are pushing for construction of the facility in Flushing Meadows Corona Park say yes -- but they acknowledge the deal is far from done, and it might be years before a MLS team plays its first home game in north-central Queens. Despite reports suggesting construction could begin early next year, the proposal still has to clear environmental and legislative obstacles.<br /><br />There&#039;s also potential for conflict with local residents, who are concerned about the loss of parkland and opposed to commercial development of the park.<br /><br />&quot;These stadiums and the process take time,&quot; said MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche, describing the negotiations as &quot;exploratory.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s still an ongoing process right now.&quot;<br /><br />Still, Queens Chamber of Commerce&#039;s Executive Director, Jack Friedman, is so optimistic about the completion of a 25,000-seat soccer-specific stadium, he told the Daily News, &quot;It&#039;s definitely going to happen.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s going to be a great, great thing.&quot;<br /><br />The stadium, plotted for the section of the park called The Fountain of Planets, would be the home field for the city&#039;s first major professional soccer team since the Cosmos - the team that introduced Americans to such stars as Pele and Franz Beckenbauer - moved to New Jersey&#039;s Giants Stadium in 1976.<br />&nbsp;<br />League officials want to bring a team to the Big Apple to create a rivalry with the New York Red Bulls, the MLS team that plays its home games in Harrison, N.J. The team would draw fans from Corona and nearby neighborhoods dominated by soccer-crazy Latino fans, who last year did their part to sellout an Ecuador-Greece friendly at Citi Field.<br /><br />The Red Bulls have struggled to draw fans to their $250 million stadium, and their presence hasn&#039;t been the financial boon Harrison anticipated. The small industrial town has plunged into debt since Red Bull Arena was erected.<br /><br />Still, MLS is eager to bring another team into the area - and are pushing for completion while staunch supporter Mayor Bloomberg is in office.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;There are 13 million people in the metropolitan area,&quot; said Courtemanche, whose league currently boasts 19 franchises in the United States and Canada. &quot;The research that&#039;s been conducted indicates that clearly is an opportunity for two professional soccer teams in this area.&quot;<br />MLS officials also say they will replace the existing soccer fields in the area with upgraded fields surrounding the stadium. They&#039;d be available for recreational use.<br /><br />&quot;MLS is ready to run youth leagues, child obesity programs, so they&#039;re really engaging the local community,&quot; Friedman said. &quot;With this and Citi Field and the U.S. Open Tennis Center, we really feel like we developed a destination area, like a sports Mecca.&quot;<br /><br />The main hurdle to the project, Mayor Bloomberg said on Monday, is replacing the roughly nine acres of parkland the city would give up for the project. One proposal discussed by state and city officials would call for the Metropolitan Transit Authority to turn over an equivalent amount of land that would be converted to parks.<br /><br />Friedman outlined two specific proposals -- one that would transform the area of the abandoned Flushing airport, and another transformation closer to Forest Hills near the abandoned Long Island Railroad lines.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ve got to find land in roughly the same area,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;There is land on an MTA site, which everybody said, &#039;Let&#039;s get that.&#039; I have not talked to (MTA chairman) Joe Lhota, and I don&#039;t know how practical it is, and how much Joe needs that land for other things. Before we go spending or taking away Joe Lhota&#039;s land, maybe we should ask him.&quot;<br /><br />State Sen. Jose Peralta said he is enthusiastic about the proposal, but the Democrat from East Elmhurst doesn&#039;t want his constituents to lose green space, either.<br /><br />&quot;We want to avoid a situation where city parkland is replaced with a parcel in Duchess County,&quot; Peralta said. &quot;That&#039;s the key to getting this thing ironed out.&quot;<br /><br />The Bloomberg administration also wants to make sure the soccer league has adequate financing for the privately funded project, a City Hall source told the Daily News.<br /><br />Parking might also be an issue. Supporters of the facility say soccer fans could park at Citi Field and lots used for the US Open; MLS has discussed a scenario in which it won&#039;t host games conflicting with either Mets games or the US Open, alleviating the parking strain.<br /><br />But Citi Field is a hike from the proposed side, and the proponents will have to work out plans for disabled fans. They may also face opposition from businesses and residents who fear soccer fans will take away parking spots.<br /><br />The stadium might also compete with Citi Field for concerts and other non-baseball events. The Mets&#039; owners were once in discussions with MLS about purchasing the expansion team, but have taken their name out of the hat.<br />Before targeting Flushing, MLS investigated 20 sites spanning al five boroughs - including Randall&#039;s Island, Willets Point and Pier 40.<br /><br />MLS will select an ownership group that will take over financing the stadium and management of the franchise once a location is selected, Courtemanche said. The new owners will have to pony up for hefty expansion fee. The last team to join the league, the Montreal Impact, paid $40 million, and the fee is expected to increase dramatically for a New York City franchise.<br /><br />Despite the substantial monetary commitment, Courtemanche said it&#039;s just a matter of picking one of the multiple ownership groups that have stepped forward, not finding one.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Saudi consortium Sela Sport owns the rights to the Cosmos name and is planning to field a team in the second-tier North American Soccer League next year. The Cosmos have committed to multiple years with NASL, but ownership remains in talks with MLS about a future partnership.<br /><br />&quot;Clearly, we&#039;ve had discussions with the Cosmos,&quot; Courtemanche said.<br /><br />The Cosmos have maintained they have the means to fund a New York franchise in MLS.<br /><br />Read more: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/queens-300-million-soccer-stadium-house-mls-franchise-article-1.1136400#ixzz23Zt4T7mI" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/queens-300-million-soccer-stadium-house-mls-franchise-article-1.1136400#ixzz23Zt4T7mI</a></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_45307"><span class="bbc_u">Village Voice</span>: <strong>Don&#039;t Count Your Cosmos Before They&#039;ve Hatched</strong> by Neil deMarcus<br /><br />Ever since the Post&#039;s Albany columnist Fred Dicker reported on Monday -- based solely on two unnamed sources -- that a deal for an MLS stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is &quot;close to being wrapped up&quot; and that construction &quot;could begin early next year,&quot; the story has bounced around the journoverse like a free kick off Tobin Heath. WNYC chimed in with the news that Mayor Bloomberg had cited the project semi-approvingly (&quot;My understanding is there&#039;s a lot of sentiment in Albany that they would be willing to do it&quot;), while Bloomberg News did the same for Gov. Cuomo (&quot;We support bringing major league soccer to New York and are working with MLS to make that a reality&quot;). Deadspin, meanwhile, went off on an unnamed-source tangent of its own, insisting that &quot;a really rich dude from the UAE&quot; is in the lead to buy a Queens expansion franchise, which may or may not end up being a revival of the New York Cosmos.<br /><br />Before everyone rushes out to buy hideous Pele throwback jerseys, though, take a deep breath. Conversations with public officials and community activists make it clear that any Queens MLS stadium still has enough hurdles to clear that there&#039;s no way on earth construction will begin in the next 12 months. And some obstacles -- in particular, the one with a baseball-headed mascot -- could end up deep-sixing the project before it ever gets off the ground.<br /><br />The report (sorry, &quot;exclusive&quot; report) by Dicker that started this whole thing was based on only two sources, one entirely unnamed, the other referenced only as an &quot;excited state official.&quot; (Make your own damn joke.) Given that Dicker&#039;s beat is Albany, the likely scenario is that some capitol official -- Assemblymember Francisco Moya, who last month penned a Daily News op-ed calling Flushing Meadows &quot;the perfect location&quot; for an MLS stadium, is a reasonable suspect -- wanted to spread the word that things were proceeding apace in the legislature, which must sign off on &quot;alienation&quot; of any New York parkland that&#039;s going to be converted to other uses.<br /><br />Before the legislature can alienate city parkland, however, it needs to receive a &quot;home rule&quot; message from the city council giving it the go-ahead. When the Yankees wanted to seize Macombs Dam Park for their new stadium, Bronx councilmembers happily obliged, firing off a home rule message in a mere eight days. In Queens, though, this will require the signoff of councilmember Julissa Ferreras, who&#039;s been publicly cautious about the MLS plan. Ferreras spokesperson Tarik Coles told the Voice last week that while his boss &quot;is in support of MLS coming to Queens, it&#039;s just a matter of things being done correctly&quot; -- including soliciting community input on how and where to replace the public soccer fields that would be razed to make way for the Cosmosphere, something that&#039;s still very much up in the air.<br /><br />Ferreras&#039; approval would also be required for the next stage of the process: ULURP, the uniform land use review process that all rezonings and changes in land use are required to undergo in the city. (Even if MLS were to try to argue that a stadium isn&#039;t a new use of parkland -- because it would still be a public park, and buying a ticket to soccer is, um, a form of recreation? -- the league would still presumably require ULURP to get a long-term lease on the space.) This would require an environmental impact statement to be drawn up, which would trigger a nine-month series of mandatory public hearings, at which point we&#039;d already be well into the second half of 2013, if not beyond.<br /><br />And even if Ferreras is brought around to full support for the stadium -- say, via something involving Chris Quinn and extraordinary rendition -- MLS could still face an even more formidable foe. By all accounts, Mets owners Fred and Jeff Wilpon are less than thrilled about someone other than themselves opening a soccer stadium in Queens, especially after their initial interest in buying an MLS expansion franchise fell by the wayside thanks to their Madoff-spawned money woes. There&#039;s also the little matter that any soccer team would want to use the Mets&#039; parking spaces for its fans -- and the Wilpons already have their own plans to partner with uberdevelopers Related on a shopping mall in their parking lot. A lot, incidentally, which is also technically part of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. (Flushing Meadows is the unofficial city record holder for &quot;most stuff that you would never think would be in a park.&quot; Not to mention &quot;most stuff you wouldn&#039;t think would exist in this century.&quot;)<br /><br />In planting his story, what Dicker&#039;s Albany informant was most likely after was to jump-start the MLS plan, giving it a higher profile as it enters into the ring to battle it out with the U.S. Tennis Association&#039;s proposed expansion, the Mets&#039; Willets West project, and maybe even a casino. Which is exactly what he got, courtesy of the aggregatoverse. We&#039;re so easy sometimes.<br /><a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/dont_count_your.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/08/dont_count_your.php</a></div>

Most notably, the New England Patriots have a mall in their parking lot. The difference? The Patriots sell out every game, play in extreme hot and extreme cold weather when folks are looking to step indoors for a little while, have a tailgating culture with lots of fans showing up hours early and staying well after the game is over, and are located in an area that is under-served by shopping centers. The Mets have none of those things going for them. Really bad idea to build a mall there. But that&#039;s the Wilpons for you.</div>

The Red Bulls are fun to watch and they really have some good games coming to the venue but the city didn&#039;t do much to help the area. In fact,<br />you hope that you are out of there with the groups or it might get sketchy even a half hour past the game. There is an abandoned<br />factory right next to the field and something really unresolved (big mud pit) in front of the stadium. Inside is nice though and we&#039;ve<br />seen some excellent games lately.<br />&nbsp; In Flushing, we have much more to offer in terms of an easy commute and a big fan base. My family would be there in a heartbeat as would many local fans we know. Really hoping this happens in Queens to match this international sport with our diverse community.<br />&nbsp;And one more thing, soccer tickets tend to be affordably priced which is something sports venues in NYC can&#039;t seem to understand.<br />People could actually afford to take the family to a game. Let get the ladies in there too!</div>

The US Open has not even begun, but already fields are being used as parking lots.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LOezql.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />This is a field just past the indoor pool, which is normally used for picnicking, not parking cars. From what I could tell, the excess amount of cars were due to CBS staff getting ready for the US Open. Can&#039;t wait to see how much space will be required once thousands of fans show up. <br /><br />As for the &quot;scummy green industrial &#039;pond,&#039;&quot; which I&#039;ve read others say is filled with &quot;sewage water,&quot; it didn&#039;t seem so bad to me. The water seemed no more scummy than any other body of water in New York City parks, and definitely did not smell like sewage. This family of geese seemed to think it was swell. <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sdhSCl.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />But we all know geese hate soccer.<br /><br />At the time I shot these pictures, I did not realize my camera was in black and white mode. You&#039;re just going to have to believe me that is was not ooze-green and the geese weren&#039;t dying. </div>

These projects would meet that need in spectacular fashion and provide employment to thousands of Queens residents,&quot; said spokeswoman Julie Wood.<br /><br />The developers expressed similar sentiment, saying they would work with the community.<br /><br />The Willets Point development already went through an extensive public review and was approved in 2008. But the plan, now backed by a partnership of Related Cos. and Sterling Equities, was significantly revised and will begin undergoing an additional environmental review later this month. The USTA proposal is expected to face a review this fall. MLS, which has yet to strike a final deal with the city, also would be required to seek City Council support.<br /><br />Council Member Julissa Ferreras, who represents the area, echoed concerns about the temporary loss of community soccer fields during construction, reduced access to the park, increased traffic, pollution, noise, safety, litter and the impact of the mall on mom-and-pops.<br />&quot;I have an obligation to make sure that our community gets a voice in the processâ€¦The community needs to decide if these three different proposals are a good use of parkland,&quot; Ms. Ferreras said.<br /><br />To be sure, some developers have already promised benefits to the community. MLS has pledged to refurbish public soccer fields on the site, make additional park improvements and minimize disruption, according to people familiar with the matter, which has helped it win support from a number of politicians and community groups.<br /><br />Flushing Meadows Corona Park is the borough&#039;s largest park, where a mostly Latino and Asian immigrant population plays soccer, bikes and picnics. But the shabby, sprawling space has been plagued by funding shortages and neglect, park advocates say.<br /><br />While new stadiums would undoubtedly create strains, they could also be an opportunity to make needed upgrades, some said. &quot;It&#039;s been dependent on the ebbs and flows of public funding, which has led to fairly inconsistent maintenance,&quot; said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks. &quot;There really is an opportunity for partnerships there if these projects are going to go forward.&quot;<br /><br />On a recent sunny afternoon, people enjoying the park expressed both support and concerns about the impact of the new developments. Juan Vidal, 70 years old, who lives in New Rochelle and rides his bike in the park, said he loves soccer but thinks Flushing Meadows is too cramped for a major-league stadium. &quot;They should do it someplace else,&quot; he said.<br /><br />â€”Alison Fox contributed to this article.<br /><br /><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444426404577647743259180070.html?mod=googlenews" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444426404577647743259180070.html?mod=googlenews</a></div>
