				OK, so I live in Forest Hills and although I acknowledge that it&#039;s a nice area, I have grown bored with it after 13 years.&nbsp; Lots of couples and lots of children, but not a good single person scene.&nbsp; I am not looking for a crazy party vibe, but just more singles floating around.&nbsp; My building in Forest Hills has maybe 10% singles and a lot of them are elderly.&nbsp; The rest are young couples...nothing against couples...I used to be one, but it&#039;s not where I am right now.<br /><br />Is Jackson Heights good or is it also a couples area?<br /><br />Would Astoria or perhaps Sunnyside or (gasp!) Brooklyn be better choices?<br /><br />Thanks everyone!

				This is a real family neighborhood. Gay families, straight families, all kinds of families, but if you aren&#039;t already paired off in Jackson Heights, it isn&#039;t going to happen here. I know some single people in the neighborhood and they&#039;re quite bored. What little nightlife there is here consists of depressing taxi-dancing clubs for lonely Latino immigrant men who are trying to forget that they miss their wives back in Puebla.<br /><br />Astoria is the place to be if you&#039;re single. There&#039;s a running joke among my friends that Jackson Heights is where Astoria residents go to breed.

				Not sure how to answer your query. A neighborhood is what you make of it, and unless you live someplace that is completely devoid of places to socialize (like Roosevelt Island, where I once lived&nbsp; :P), you can find possibilities anywhere. I guess the answer to your question lies in what you are looking for and expect to find? I presume you&#039;re not just looking for quick hook-ups (you can go to Chelsea for that or use Grindr ;D) but for places to hang out and meet other guys like yourself? Jackson Heights has great places to eat and an abundance of gay bars (and no, you don&#039;t have to speak Spanish fluently to enjoy them, though it can help ;)), and its only shortcoming is the lack of parks and greenspaces. Hey, did I mention we have a Starbucks now? <br /><br />The annual Queens Pride march and festival is Sunday, June 5th: http://www.queenspride.com/QueensPride2011/prideinfo.php<br />The JHBG historic tour is Sunday, June 19 (rain or shine): http://www.jhbg.org/events/events.html<br /><br />Maybe attending one or both events will help you decide if it&#039;s worth the move from Forest Hills?

				May I ask how old you are?<br /><br />I had problems finding people my own age in JH (not for romantic purposes, just friendship). All the people on the floor of my apartment building were 60+, except for youngish family. I never did find a neighborhood bar that I agreed with my tastes.

				honestly, i would look elsewhere. <br /><br />my main reason for wanting to move out of JH is the lack of young single people. don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s a great neighborhood for families/couples but once the market gets better, i&#039;m out of here.

				I&#039;ll second Steven&#039;s post - come for Pride - and take a look around. It&#039;s not Chelsea or Hell&#039;s Kitchen, but there&#039;s a high quality of life here, and it&#039;s a lot closer to HK and Chelsea than Forest Hills, plus a visible and open gay community (though not necessarily many young singles).

				Many of the gays I have met in the neighborhood are coupled or have made the defense of marriage their utmost priority. Though the situation is very different in the local bars and nightclubs, at the Queens gay pride parade and at Queens Pride House, I am assuming most of the people at these places and events do not actually live in the area. (I could be wrong.) I recently created a Facebook group (http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_130253643718562) to facilitate discussion and interaction among Jackson Heights queers regardless of their ages and relationship statuses. I encourage any gay person living in or near, or considering living in or near, Jackson Heights with a Facebook account to join it. We currently have over sixty members, and thatâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />The group description is<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The number of gays in Jackson Heights is clearly escalating and Iâ€™m jealous I donâ€™t know more of them. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to make new friends in the neighborhood? We need a good online forum to help bring us together because walking up to strangers on the street and saying â€œYouâ€™re queer; right?â€ can be a bit intimidating. Feel free to make new friends in this group, continue old ones, meet for lunch, walking, bowling, cinema etc.<br /><br />This group needed a catchy name thatâ€™s easily found by searching, but rest assured that the word <em>gay</em> refers, as it did in the 1960s and 1970s, to the full breadth of the community: Lesbians, gay men, homosexuals, bisexuals, and those of us anywhere along the continuum of transgender. Needless to say, no ethnic group is excluded. One of the best aspects of the neighborhood and its environs is the ethnic diversity. We are Asians, Latin Americans, Europeans, Africans, Near Easterners, Pacific Islanders and everybody else. We are also, in case you hadnâ€™t noticed, of all ages, body types and levels of ability.<br /><br />Also, anyone living close enough to Jackson Heights to want to join the fun is more than welcome, so our queer neighbors in Woodside, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst and Corona should feel free to join.<br /><br />At least at the beginning, I wish to de-emphasize the commercial gay venues in the area. We all love the bars and discos on and near Roosevelt Avenue, but this group may become swamped with endless promotions for parties in each venue on every day of the week should their participation be encouraged. However, the not-for-profit and nonprofit organizations should actively participate. As of now, that means the Queens Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee (QLGPC), Queens Pride House, SAGE and New York Bear Den, but other not-for-profit groups, gay and not-necessarily-gay, local and citywide, are welcome.<br /><br />I am Mosheh, better known as Mark to the world at large, and I live in the western Heights in the seventies. I created this group to spend more time with you and meet my gay neighbors in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />If you do not wish to be drowned in notifications, I recommend editing your settings by clicking â€œEdit Settingsâ€ in the upper right area.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div align="center">â€¢ <em><strong>Gay Neighbors in Jackson Heights</strong></em> (http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_130253643718562).</div>
