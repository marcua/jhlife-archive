				Did anyone attend this forum last week with Helen Sears and the head of the Queens Planning Dept. on the topic of &quot;Zoning&quot; according to the flier I spotted about three hours after the event ended?<br /><br />If so, can you fill us in on what was discussed?

				I didn&#039;t hear about this meeting either. I would have loved to have gone. Did anyone actually attend? <br /><br />And, how would one know about this meeting in normal circumstances? Shouldn&#039;t this be listed in the Community Board calendar (even if not officially a Community Board event)?

				Is the &quot;zoning&quot; that your talking about have to do with restrictions on what they can do with one family homes?&nbsp; I see quite a few homes which had been only one family now turned into 3-4 family homes.&nbsp; The result is more trouble parking,more people, more noise, more garbage, less green, less pride etc., etc., etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m a transplant from Brooklyn and Jackson Heights seems much less congested for me. I hope that the information will be posted here regarding such a meeting.

				I heard that some of Helen&#039;s constituents got postcards about the meeting (I live in Montserrat&#039;s district). Other than that I only realized it b/c I saw a flier (too late) in the window of the Jewish Center. <br /><br />It could have been about anything -- upzoning Northern Blvd or Roosevelt, downzoning other areas, or a million other things. I wonder if we will ever know?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I did attend the meeting. And I wouldn&#039;t have known about it either ecept for the fliers I saw about 2 hours before the meeting. I walked down 37th ave earlier that morning and saw nothing, when I went out in the late afternoon there they were. the Councilperson&#039;s office is certainly on their gig.. ugh. Strangely enough the event was well attended mostly by Helen&#039;s regular constituents&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />For the most&nbsp; part the meeting was a presentation on zoning given be the Director of City Planing for Queens. It was a watered down lesson on how the city is divided in to zones (Residential, Commercial, &amp; Industrial) and what those zones mean. The major concerns that Helen laid out to be addressed were how tall buildings could go in JH, and what could be done about houses that have paved over their front yards to create parking spaces etc. <br /><br />The bottom line is most of JH&#039;s residential areas are zoned for R6 or R7 which are buildings that top out somewhere between 6 and 10 stories. Apparently there is no real restriction on how high a building in these categories can go, however the higher a building is the further back from the street it must be set, which after a certain point makes building really tall buildings impractical in our neighborhood. At least that&#039;s the jist of what was said. <br /><br />As far as paved yards is concerned the city recently passed a law the requires home owners with yards to maintain their yards as such and gives incentives to new developments to include more green space in their plans. So while JH has to deal with the yards that have already been destroyed we can rest assured that there are laws in place to protect the remaining yards. <br /><br />I left before the Q&amp;A period so I&#039;m not sure what else was discussed. I don&#039;t know if they touched on the over developement of 73rd and 74th Sts. as a zoning issue or not, but I do plan to follow up with Ms.Sear&#039;s office on that. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
