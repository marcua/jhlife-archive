				Moved into the colonial court 35-36 on 76th street late last year and am alarmed by the number of waterbugs that i see in the basement and in the hallways. I live on the 6th floor, and we get them up there. The building is very clean though, and this includes problem areas like the incinerator.<br /><br />I&#039;m baffled by their presence. 30 years spent living on the other, less scenic, less hygenic side of roosevelt avenue and i can count the number of waterbugs i&#039;ve seen on one hand. sure we had pesky little roaches because of poor maintainence and inconsiderate neighbors, but never waterbugs.<br /><br />Is this a common problem throughout the historic district?

				I may just be very fortunate, but I&#039;ve been in the Greystones for just about 4 years now and I&#039;ve only had one waterbug/cockroach sighting in my apartment since moving in. (And I credit that to an upstairs neighbor who was gut renovating her kitchen at the time.) So I don&#039;t think you can make a blanket statement about the entire historic district.<br /><br />As a lifelong New York apartment dweller, my experience tells me it&#039;s not just the cleanliness of the building in general, but also that of your neighbors. If you&#039;ve got neighbors who leave food out, pile dirty dishes in the sink all week, or hoarders who never throw anything out living adjacent to your apartment, there&#039;s almost nothing you can do about certain pests. <br /><br />The other possibility is that there&#039;s a serious and chronic water/moisture condition. I presume the 6th is the top floor? Has the roof membrane been checked? What about the parapet walls, coping stones or pointing on the brickwork? Are all the drainage pipes clear and unblocked?

				hmm... my building is full of elderly people, so it is possible we have a few hoarders. But Everything is &quot;seemingly&quot; very clean. Again, no garbage strewn about the halls or incinerators. There is work being done on the roof, and for some reason the entire building is very hot/humid - a perfect environment for waterbugs (I&#039;m talking about like almost 10 degrees hotter than it is outside). <br /><br />Could you please explain how the pointing, parapet walls contribute to a &quot;water/moisture&quot; condition.

				I don&#039;t think waterbugs have anything to do with cleanliness.&nbsp; They breed in mulch and compost so it&#039;s probably because of your gardens...They also like leaves, dead trees, wood piles and retainer or driveway walls.&nbsp;

The previous generations of tenants chose to simply add another layer of tar paper over the previous layers, and at some point had a tar-like material applied to the inside of the parapet walls to waterproof them. Water and moisture becomes trapped between layers, which can rot wood and cause brick and mortar to disintegrate over time. It can generate mold, and probably creates an environment suitable for colonies of waterbugs. We had all of this old material removed.

Like you said, putting tar on brick is absolutely the worst thing you can do to a wall, and in fact doesn&#039;t even stop the leaks for more than a few months. It does, however, create more business for engineers and contractors.
