					So I finally went by UFC today... I didn&#039;t realize from the casual mentions of the place that it&#039;s not just fried chicken, but <em>Korean</em> fried chicken. I can never get back those two years of lost Korean fried chicken opportunities, but I&#039;m glad to finally know the truth! My life satisfaction has significantly improved.

					I was staying at a timeshare that my friend&#039;s father owns (or rents, or whatever one does with a timeshare).&nbsp; It was called La Belle Maison.&nbsp; Run by Wyndham.&nbsp; It was pretty good.&nbsp; Had a fitness center and pool.&nbsp; There was also a separate Wyndham that was in the French Quarter proper (ours was just outside... basically, you cross the street and you&#039;re in the Quarter).&nbsp; <br /><br />Some other friends stayed at the Marriott.&nbsp; It was also centrally located and seemed nice - very big.&nbsp; It had a lot of little stores in the lobby and either a bar, restaurant, or both.&nbsp; Another friend stayed Hotel St. Helene, which was much smaller and adorable.&nbsp; It was also directly in the French Quarter.&nbsp; It looked pretty nice, too.&nbsp; They held her bags for her after she checked out (as did the Wyndham where I stayed).&nbsp; They also had a pool.<br /><br />Honestly, there was no shortage of conveniently located hotels, so you&#039;ll probably be okay wherever you end up.&nbsp; And I think it&#039;s fairly impossible not to have a good time in that city.&nbsp; Just be sure to check the weather - we had a lot of monsoon-type rain while I was there and they don&#039;t have umbrella salespeople who appear out of thin air like they do here.

					So I was in New Orleans over Labor Day weekend and stopped at a cool funky store called Road Kill with some friends.&nbsp; I ended up buying a dress there and while chatting with the guy at the register found out that he had grown up in Jackson Heights!&nbsp; On 80-something and Northern.&nbsp; He went to PS 69 and everything.&nbsp; He says that his mom is still living in the apartment he grew up in.&nbsp; He&#039;s been in NOLA for 20 years now, so I assume she&#039;s been in the neighborhood for quite some time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t catch his name (went back to the store again, but he wasn&#039;t around), but I thought that was pretty cool.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					Lizbeth, this may be too far north, but I just saw this beautiful two-story three bedroom on Trulia: <a href="http://www.trulia.com/rental/3058526023-3050-83rd-St-FL-2-East-Elmhurst-NY-11370" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.trulia.com/rental/3058526023-3050-83rd-St-FL-2-East-Elmhurst-NY-11370</a><br /><br />It&#039;s between 30th and 31st Avenues, but it&#039;s big and very pretty.

					I&#039;d also be interested in being involved in letters, meetings, etc.&nbsp; I think this proposal, if done right, could be really wonderful for our neighborhood.
