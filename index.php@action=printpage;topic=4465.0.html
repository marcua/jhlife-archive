				I live near the Chase bank on 77th Street on the North side of Northern Blvd.&nbsp; On warm nights, so far this year and last, I very often hear a bird singing in the middle of the night.&nbsp; It seems to sing alone.&nbsp; I am by no means a bird watcher but I AM a bird lover and I&#039;m quite curious about what it is.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in the area since 1985 and have only been hearing this bird for the past season or two.&nbsp; Has anyone else heard it?

				very funny MW!&nbsp; <br /><br />Madalyn, It usually chirps the same tweets over and over.&nbsp; It sounds beautiful....but lonely because it sings alone.&nbsp; Although, a whole chorus of them at 3am may be a bit disturbing so I guess lonely is better.

				Almondine,<br /><br />One of the most common night-singers around here is the Mockingbird but is sings a wide and wonderful reportory of songs.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of my favorites!<br /><br />Lately, pre-dawn, I have been hearing a loud song which, as it turns out from Googling bird songs, is a Cardinal.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually two or three whistles on an upscale - like a guy whistling to call someone, and then a series of faster whistles that may be going upscale or downscale.<br /><br />If you Google cardinals and birdsong, you can see if that&#039;s it.&nbsp; They have a few different tunes too so see if you can find several.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a link to a site that has lots of birds and their songs:<br /><br />http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~tony/birds/index.html<br /><br /><br />

				It could definitely be a Mockingbird.&nbsp; It is not bothersome though, like some people make Mockingbirds out to be.&nbsp; On the other hand, it&#039;s never been right outside my window.&nbsp; From a distance, it sounds lovely.&nbsp;

				I would much rather hear bird song than car alarms or honking horns.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find it disturbing at all, even if it&#039;s loud.

				The mockingbird by me (as it most likely is one) sounds beautiful. To me it just sounds lonely,as I mentioned before.&nbsp; But again, if something is going to sing at that hour, then I guess it&#039;s better to be just one than several.&nbsp; I consider it a nice treat...for now.&nbsp; I wonder how my neighbors feel....

				The mockingbird you are hearing at night is probably an unmated male - looking to woo a female with his song.<br /><br />I have never heard a mockingbird make a harsh or ugly sound.&nbsp; They are rather creative in the wide variety of songs they sing.

				You might like this project by artist Nina Katchadourian, where she installed &quot;car alarms&quot; in cars that were actually recordings of bird calls that sounded like car alarms.<br /><br />http://www.ninakatchadourian.com/confusinganimals/caralarms.php<br /><br />NPR&#039;s All Things Considered did a story on this and you can hear the story and the natural car alarms on their site here <br />The Call of the Wild Car Alarm &nbsp;(http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/july/car_alarm/)
