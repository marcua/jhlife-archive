					Has anyone gotten a flu shot locally recently? I called Vitalscript and Franks and both are out of flu shots and not sure when to expect them in. I have restrictive insurance and those were two of the pharmacies on my list. I was thinking instead of calling down the list (mostly independent pharmacies) and getting similar answers, I would just go to Costco and pay the $20. I know Costco has them in stock.

That demand is largely driven by Camara’s use of less mainstream Filipino flavors, she says. Doughnut fillings include champorado, a chocolate porridge, and pinipig, a type of toasted sweet rice preparation.<br /><br />“I feel like there’s always more that could be done with [Filipino food] and more that people can learn about. That’s really huge for me,” says Camara, who grew up regularly visiting home-style Filipino restaurants in Woodside, where she now lives. “I knew ube was one of those gateway flavors that people like to buy,” she says. “But what’s going to make these doughnuts special is once I start bringing all the other Filipino flavors.”<br /><br />Camara kickstarted the business a few months after she lost her catering job at Union Square Hospitality Group, in March, when the company laid off 2,000 employees due to the COVID-19 related shutdown. At first, the doughnut business just served as a side hustle, though in recent months, it’s taken on a life of its own.<br /><br />click link for full article <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2020/9/8/21427633/kora-filipino-desserts-doughnuts-instagram" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://ny.eater.com/2020/9/8/21427633/kora-filipino-desserts-doughnuts-instagram</a>

He was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.<br /><br />He served at the Louisiana Department of Health before and after Hurricane Katrina, with a focus on reshaping the state’s healthcare system in the wake of the storm. He was a Rhodes Scholar, earning an MSc in global public health from the University of Oxford.<br /><br />He trained at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School and Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School. During his training, Chokshi performed clinical work in Guatemala, Peru, Botswana, Ghana, and India.<br /><br />Chokshi also served as a White House Fellow in the Obama Administration and was the principal health advisor to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. In 2016, President Obama appointed him to the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health.<br /><br />Chokshi now lives in Jackson Heights, just a few blocks away from Elmhurst Hospital, with his wife, a public school teacher and Queens native of Dominican and Argentinean descent, and 14-month-old daughter.<br /><br />“I saw what this virus did to my community, to my neighbors and to my fellow healthcare workers,” he said. “But his epidemic is only the most recent example of the vicious cycle of illness and inequity that I’ve seen over my career. Each of those experiences further forged my conviction that we must build toward better health systems with prevention at the center and a more proactive approach to avoidable human suffering.”<br /><br />Click link to read full article <a href="https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/queens-based-doctor-set-to-replace-oxiris-barbot-as-new-department-of-health-commissioner/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/queens-based-doctor-set-to-replace-oxiris-barbot-as-new-department-of-health-commissioner/</a>

					Sad news for artists in the area -- the only comprehensive large-sized art store in the area, Artist and Craftsman LIC, has permanently closed. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Artist &amp; Craftsman Supply</strong><br /><br />&quot;It is with heavy hearts that we announce the difficult decision to close A&amp;C Long Island City permanently. Our staff and senior managers have put great effort into the store, but due to the conditions of the local market and the financial losses we have faced, we are unable to sustain our operations to make business viable. We are truly grateful for the loyalty, dedication, and outstanding level of professionalism displayed by our employees.<br /><br />A huge thank you to our loyal customers who have supported us in Long Island City. You can still find Artist &amp; Craftsman Supply throughout the country, including our three locations in Park Slope, Williamsburg, and Bushwick. Thank you for all of your support.&quot;

They must also have lost income from April 1 to July 31.<br /><br />The one-time subsidy covers the difference between the &quot;rent burden&quot; — the amount of rent above 30 percent of a renter&#039;s income — before and after March 1. It also contains a cap on the subsidy amount based on fair market rent.<br /><br />That means it likely won&#039;t cover the entirety of rent for most New Yorkers.<br /><br />But it will provide help for some New Yorkers for up to four months of rent payments between April and July.<br />

					Has anyone else been getting a lot more spam calls than usual? Just this week I&#039;ve been getting about 5 per day with area codes all over NY, with the noticeable exception of&nbsp; the usual NYC area codes. I used to get them from 917 (which is what my number starts with) and now they are coming from 518, 516 and 914, which are all within NY state, but not within the 5 boroughs.<br /><br />I block the number after they call but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s doing any good.

Excerpt below:</strong><br /><br /><strong>The Look Book Goes to the Roosevelt Avenue Subway Station In Jackson Heights, where ridership on the 7 and E lines is slowly picking up.</strong><br />By Jane Starr Drinkard Photographs by Kyle Dorosz<br /><br />Donnell George (pictured above), Unemployed DJ, Upper East Side.<br /><br />Where are you going?<br />The Upper East Side, to my friend’s house, where I’m staying. I’m just off a flight from Miami. My story is insane, bro.<br /><br />What happened?<br />After the pandemic hit, I was laid off from my job at the Standard. I was broke and ended up in Florida — I had to go stay at my childhood home with my mother. My mom, my family — they don’t really accept homosexuality. And I moved to New York in the first place to be gay, to explore myself. So going home — I had to put everything that New York brought out of me back into a box. Those months were dark, and they were raw. But then the moon and the sun and the planets aligned: Unemployment kicked in. My friend sent me $100. I booked a flight back to New York.<br /><br />How does it feel to be back?<br />Girl, listen. I’m just so happy.<br /><br /><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/472/fc7/233a62f24f6c5dd3aa97019f1ce67c268e-200626-NYMAG-Lookbook-096.rvertical.w570.jpg" alt="" height="400" class="bbc_img resized" /><br /><br /><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ff8/6d2/5dd9c116f190ba4fc67b1321dd8105fdce-200626-NYMAG-Lookbook-037.rvertical.w570.jpg" alt="" height="400" class="bbc_img resized" /><br /><br /><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5d1/520/525abdc6a1c013c76feeb500c4b6b10855-200626-NYMAG-Lookbook-095.rvertical.w570.jpg" alt="" height="400" class="bbc_img resized" />

					This is such a horrible story. A drunk driver hit a woman who had founded a Covid 19 charity that delivered food to needy people. She was in the process of making a delivery and this guy hit her. Now she&#039;s on a ventilator. What I don&#039;t understand is his only instruction was &quot;don&#039;t drive.&quot; He didn&#039;t have a license so that&#039;s a no brainer.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-dwi-crash-arraignment-queens-mom-coronavirus-charity-20200625-rs6bwlg6vff7hmlvqtofsotdau-story.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-dwi-crash-arraignment-queens-mom-coronavirus-charity-20200625-rs6bwlg6vff7hmlvqtofsotdau-story.html</a><br /><br />A motorist accused of speeding with an open can of beer before a crash that nearly killed a Queens mom making food deliveries for a coronavirus charity was released without bail Thursday and ordered not to drive anywhere in the state.<br /><br />Luis Encalada told cops after Wednesday’s crash that he drank three beers and was driving without a license when his Honda sedan plowed into the back of an SUV along Northern Blvd., pinning Nancy Tituaña between the two vehicles.<br /><br />Tituaña, 35, was delivering food for Brigada de Esperanza NY, a food charity she launched to help people affected by coronavirus, when Encalada’s out-of-control car struck her. The mother of three was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital Center in critical condition, leaving canned goods and produce scattered on the ground.<br /><br />Authorities said Encalada had three times the legal limit of booze in his system when he crashed and an open can of Coors Light was visible in his SUV’s cup holder.<br /><br />A member of the Brigada board, Alex Bautista, said Tituaña had a six-hour operation Wednesday followed by a five-hour operation Thursday.
