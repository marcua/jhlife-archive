				A new wreck of a store on 82nd between Roosevelt and 37th.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who walks this block can’t help but notice a new discount clothing store with music blaring from a large speaker at the front door, shredded newspapers on their floor, crudely painted window signage, and racks of cheap cloths pushed out on the street encumbering the pedestrian flow.&nbsp; What an eyesore.&nbsp; I would think that the Jackson Heights BID encourages businesses to be more respectful of the neighborhood’s commercial norms.

I haven&#039;t passed by yet, but when I do and if the speakers are loud, I will call 311 to report this. This is not a positive direction for 82nd St., which has seen some improvements in recent years.

				I passed by today and there was loud music coming from a store, but to me it looks like a store that&#039;s almost out of business rather than a new one opening up. I suspect they are playing the music to bring people inside to buy the last remaining merchandise. I&#039;m certainly not in support of the music, and if the other cheap clothing stores start doing it as well, it would be pure cacophony on that block, but to me it looks like a temporary situation so I did not call 311.<br /><br />Maybe there is a new store that is also blasting music as well, but this is the one that stood out to me for its loud music and unkempt appearance.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/lskv2yI.jpg?1)

				This is the same store in street view, Oct. 2017. So it must be going out of business now, given its current appearance.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/V70tXAB.jpg?1)

				I was as close to being beat up as I ever was, trying to do a 311 outside Boost Mobile on Roosevelt 37th. They were blaring sound. Still do. I was taking a photo for the 311 app and lady came out screaming. I&#039;m pretty tough, so if I say I was almost jumped- it was scary. Now, I seriously walk on the other side of the street. <br />Send address (sorry if I missed it) I will do a 311 also. The noise, all the noise is driving me batty. <br />

				What a jerk this owner is.&nbsp; Not only is the music blaring, you couldn&#039;t even walk up the street because they were blocking the sidewalk selling crap.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve also called 311 about a store and the crazy loud music, but this place looks like its going out of business.&nbsp; Seems to be&nbsp; an ongoing nuisance. Why don&#039;t they just close the doors and keep the music inside.&nbsp; Also noticed a lot of sidewalk vendors on 82 street lately.

				Why all the side walk vendors? We are so over crowded, such little sidewalk space.&nbsp; I assume ther has to be a law that you can’t sell crap especially food on the street without a licensee. In my perfect JH world all these vendors would be tossed out and we actually had our side walks back.&nbsp;

I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s being allowed. I have started to walk up one of the side streets adjacent to 82nd when I have to get off at 82nd, because it&#039;s just too frustrating to deal with this obstacle course.
