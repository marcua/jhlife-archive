				Thanks for posting this article. I know that the handwringing over immigration and real estate has been going on in Jackson Heights since the beginning, but I would be interested to read print articles about this from bygone eras, especially from independent or otherwise &quot;undergound&quot; publications. Is there a historian of Jackson Heights print culture around? I know often the best sources for information on this are community members who&#039;ve been around for a while...<br /><br />I must confess to being shocked that Google is scanning even old magazines. <br /><br />The opt-out settlement seems like a gross injustice to me. I think it is unreasonable to assume that all orphan texts want to be reborn in the 21st Century eternally searchable. When they&#039;re able to find and reproduce underground zines from the neighborhood, I&#039;ll be giving them a pass. Until then, it just grates on me that only one of the largest and richest corporations with tacky slogans like &quot;Don&#039;t be evil&quot; gets an exemption from the U.S. Code. <br /><br />

				there have always been pockets of tolerance and intolerance in this area. it took ages for the founding families of St. Joan of Arc to find a spot for the church building because non-Catholic residents thought that Catholics bred like rabbits and would destroy the upstanding character of the neighborhood as it stood in the &#039;20s. the more things change....

				I absolutely love this interracial neighborhood for it&#039;s diversity. Here&#039;s one disturbing housing trend that I see<br />though, which is the homes in Jackson Heights often have many illegal tenants in basements and other parts of the <br />house. The fire over the weekend in Woodside had a tragic ending, in part to this practice. Can we establish<br />some real guidelines for fire safety while acknowledging that many immigrant groups have large families<br />and others in these local houses? One Open House I went to had turned a three-bedroom home in what<br />they called seven-bedrooms by using closets and partitions as well as the basement to make these &quot;rooms&quot;.<br />Is there a government agency that oversees this? This could save lives...

				in theory, homes are inspected, as i mentioned in another thread. as with all law enforcement agencies, there are officers all too willing to look the other way given the proper &quot;encouragement&quot; to do so. when i co-owned a private house, we had inspections at least three times a year. we were legal, so we had no problems, but neighbors managed to squeeze through somehow.

				There was a community forum held this past June that was meant to address the topic of illegal basement apartments.&nbsp; The focus seemed to be on tenant advocacy by promoting regulations that would assist the immigrant population in finding safe and affordable housing.&nbsp; Was anyone here able to attend this forum?<br /><br />Illegal Basement Apartments- A community forum (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2737.0)

				To help searches....<br /><br />I believe the article was from September 25, 1978 (not 73) and written by Mark Schorr. Here&#039;s a response &quot;letter to the editor&quot; that I found on Google Book Search, but I can&#039;t find (or they don&#039;t seem to have) the earlier issue. The article was called &quot;Gunfights in the Cocaine Corral&quot;<br /><br />http://books.google.com/books?id=A-ECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Mark+Schorr+%22New+York+Magazine%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&amp;q=Mark%20Schorr%20%22New%20York%20Magazine%22&amp;f=false
