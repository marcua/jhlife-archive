				I&#039;ve been going to <strong>Gulzar Beauty Salon</strong>, 74th and Roosevelt, for traditional eyebrow threading for several months. For the price $5 and the efficiency you can&#039;t beat this place. I really enjoy the no frills yet all business approach. No appointment necessary and I&#039;ve only had to wait, for literally one minute at most, before a chair opened up and I was taken care of in five minutes. The women who work there are nice and the place is clean enough. Before moving here I used to go to a swanky threading place in SoHo where I thought it was a deal at $25, but no more. Gulzar may not have the trendy scene of a Manhattan spa, but it&#039;s the place for me to get what I need.<br /><br />Hope other people can check it out.<br /><br />Anyone recommend a place for pedicures?

				Todd, eyebrow threading is a dipilitory (sp?) technique whereby hairs along the eyebrow line are removed using thread and a twisting motion rather than the more conventional methods like waxing or tweezing.&nbsp; Threading is quicker and if done correctly, beautifully sculpts the eyebrows.&nbsp; It&#039;s a traditional method that is popular in India, perhaps this explains its popularity in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had this done twice, and on each occasion, my eyebrows looked amazing.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen lots of posts on threading, but not much on waxing.<br /><br />Are there any good (inexpensive) waxing places in the area?&nbsp; Specifically a place that does a good <strong>Brazilian</strong>.<br /><br />I know there are quite a few places in the city, but it seems hard to find anything elsewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that the Beauty and Youth Spa in Chelsea does one for $25 which seems too good to be true.&nbsp; Has anyone been there?<br /><br />Thanks!

				To all,<br />Keep an eye on the nail salon located on the corner of 81st and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; I had a mani/pedi a few months ago and the lady taking care of me told me she had to eat her lunch in the bathroom.&nbsp; She then asked for a new nail file and the owner called her outside.&nbsp; She returned to tell me that he had reprimanded her for asking for a new file as she had received one the day before.&nbsp; She as well told me that she is timed and can&#039;t go beyond 30-45 minutes for the mani/pedi.&nbsp; After hearing this, I told the owner that I believed his behavior was somewhat abusive.&nbsp; I&#039;ll let the ladies fight their battle.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to do it for them.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; Perhaps others on this forum can get a better handle on how the ladies are being treated in that establishment by stopping by sometime. God bless them!&nbsp;

				Can anyone recommend a good eyebrow threader?&nbsp; The last time I had my eyebrows threaded, my forehead broke out in a rash.&nbsp; I&#039;m wonder if this has to do with the method itself or if my skin is just super sensitive.&nbsp; Anyone ever have a post reaction to threading?

				I&#039;ve gotten it done at the place on 37th Ave &amp; 80th a few times (also a thrifty facial!).&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what could cause a reaction since they only use thread.&nbsp; Maybe the lotion they sometimes put on when finished threading?&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve been getting mine threaded for years and it&#039;s amazing how the pain level can vary depending on the person threading.&nbsp; :/

				Nail 37 is bad.&nbsp; The owner cut me really bad one time and put this antiseptic on my finger that burned like hell and didn&#039;t even apologize.&nbsp; God, lets hope I didn&#039;t catch anything.&nbsp; Will never go back.<br /><br />Sadly, I think the neighborhood nail saloons are awful.&nbsp; I have tried every single one and they are all dirty, crowded and I can never relax completely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just went to Eve salon in Astoria which is clean, super relaxed, brand new and wonderfully soothing.&nbsp; In addition, really, really cheap.&nbsp; It would be great if Jackson Heights nail salons could take notice.&nbsp;

				i actually really like 78 Nail salon, just off 37 ave....it can get cramped, but it&#039;s clean -- both to the eye and in terms of hygiene -- and there&#039;s very little staff turnover, so the ladies get to know you and your likes.

				curly hair without blow drying means heat lamps.&nbsp; unfortunately, you&#039;ll just have to call around and see which salon has them.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some do have them, I just don&#039;t know off hand.

				I did a search on this topic and it brought up really old results.&nbsp; I thought it would be nice to start a <strong>new thread for people to post their opinions on where to go and where avoid as far as beauty treatments in the area.</strong><br /><br />Here&#039;s my very limited list of experiences... (Note: I&#039;m SHY so if a place is really crowded I&#039;d usually just walk by instead of going in and asking about wait time etc.&nbsp; If someone can recommend some great spots I will try to get over it. lol!!) Also - I bite my nails so I personally skip manicures. haha.<br /><br />Pedicures -<br />I&#039;ve only been to 78 Nail &amp; Spa in this hood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone about 4 times and had someone different each time.&nbsp; I really really like the sander - but I really hate that every single time I go there are 3-4 people in front of me and then on top of that someone comes in and has an appointment.&nbsp; It takes forever. (I&#039;d make an appt - but I don&#039;t &quot;love&quot; any of them&quot;&nbsp; Also when you walk in, nobody acknowledges your presence AT ALL - no greeting, no nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Facials-<br />I&#039;ve been to the place on 37th Ave &amp; 80th (mostly does threading) for their facials.&nbsp; It&#039;s no frills, but cheap.&nbsp; I prefer when one of the older women does the facial - but I feel it would be rude to say so, so I just deal with whoever.&nbsp; The last time I went, the girl annoyed me and I haven&#039;t been back.&nbsp; So... I&#039;m looking for other options. :)<br /><br />Threading-<br />The place on 37th &amp; 80th is fine for this.&nbsp; It&#039;s much cheaper than in Manhattan.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to go to Dulhan on B&#039;way across from the Korean market.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t a fan of their threading, but the facials were nice.<br /><br /><br />

				The original mani/pedi post was critical to those establishments already in existence. &nbsp;I moved on with DIVA&#039;s want it all! &nbsp;I&#039;m a true DIVA, but I made fun of your DIVANATRIX list serve name. &nbsp;You know it was a joke, but you got angry, so I asked that you contact me so we could discuss. &nbsp;<br /><br />In the meanwhile, I just found out that there is a greater issue at hand. &nbsp;A JH storeowner has her little grandchild at Columbia-Presbyterian and needs a heart transplant, so I think we should focus on important things. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure you would agree!! &nbsp;<br /><br />Best, &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;78 Nail &amp; Spa&quot;<br />&quot;Pedicures -<br />I&#039;ve only been to 78 Nail &amp; Spa in this hood. &nbsp;I&#039;ve gone about 4 times and had someone different each time. &nbsp;I really really like the sander - but I really hate that every single time I go there are 3-4 people in front of me and then on top of that someone comes in and has an appointment. &nbsp;<span class="bbc_u"><strong>It takes forever.

				Yay FoxyWiles!&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad you agree. :D&nbsp; <br /><br />I was just there again on Saturday and got some pretty blue toenail polish at the end of my kickass pedi.&nbsp; The girl I had this time was different - I don&#039;t know what her name is but she&#039;s a young college student studying architecture - very sweet and she did a great job.<br /><br />I also got my eyebrows waxed and that was done very well.&nbsp; This woman puts on false eyelashes that can last a few weeks for $20!&nbsp; If I had a special occasion coming up, I&#039;d totally do it.<br /><br />The only thing I don&#039;t like is one of the hairstylists comes off as super-desperate and kept asking me if I wanted a haircut (even the day I made the appt!).&nbsp; I was nice the first few times and not so nice the last few.&nbsp; Her behavior was totally unprofessional, and I could tell her continued interruptions made the girl doing my pedi a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; And seriously... I don&#039;t know why she thought she could talk me into getting a haircut by being so obnoxious.&nbsp; I have my own hairdresser that I&#039;ve been going to for years.&nbsp; There was never a chance.<br /><br />I still love the place and will continue to go back.&nbsp; And again, yay for fun nailpolish colors!! :D :D :D

				my friend and i went to tsering on sunday. (*note to self, most places don&#039;t open before noon on a sunday) i had a very nice experience there getting a $15 pedicure. although my massage chair didn&#039;t seem to work, the people were friendly and the services were plentiful -- considering i only paid $15 plus tax before tip. the range of colors are a bit limited so if you have your own varnish, you may be better off. i only get a pedicure maybe once every 6 months, i don&#039;t think i have the range of experiences to give a comparison account, but for the most part i was very satisfied spending $20 there. i mentioned to the girl that i heard about tsering on this forum and she said she worked on someone who said she would mention it on a discussion forum. i wonder if that was divanatrix.

				:D&nbsp; Yay! I was just back&nbsp; at Tsering on Thursday for a pedicure. <br /><br />Also.&nbsp; In a very surprising turn of events, I got my hair cut in the neighborhood today!&nbsp; My friend and I both had appointments with our stylist of several years this afternoon (based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn) and she canceled on us at the last minute (again) and tried to reschedule us for next week.&nbsp; I, being direly in need of a cut <strong>TODAY</strong>, did a quick yelp/messageboard search of the hood and decided to give Isabel&#039;s a try.&nbsp; (I will <em>never </em> let the Tsering stylists touch my hair because they are so obnoxious when I&#039;m getting my pedicure done.)<br /><br /><strong>Isabel&#039;s &nbsp;</strong> is on 37th Ave betw 76th &amp; 77th.<br /><br />Isabel herself was with a customer already, so Alberto took care of me.&nbsp; I found him very pleasant to deal with and he did exactly what I asked him to do with my mop.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had a consultation before I got sent to the hair-washing station where he got a feel of what my hair is like and what it does when it isn&#039;t reigned in.&nbsp; After the wash we discussed again what I was hoping to get my hair to do and decided on length etc. He was very friendly, but didn&#039;t talk my ear off. I normally get shy and uncomfortable during a cut if the stylist acts sort of fake and makes conversation for conversation&#039;s sake,&nbsp; but Alberto wasn&#039;t like that at all, and I appreciated it.&nbsp; Overall I was pleased with the experience and found everyone that I dealt with to be very friendly.<br /><br />Cost at Isabel&#039;s? $41 w/ tax.&nbsp; What I&#039;d been paying normally? $95.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>Disclaimer:&nbsp; I have no problem paying for the haircuts I had been getting from my prior stylist, but I have been ticked with the unprofessional treatment my friend and I received the last few times by canceling because she was hungover, so I figured it was time to make a point by canceling the rescheduled appointment and trying someone new.&nbsp; I may or may not go back there - who knows</em></span>

				Just wanted to let y&#039;all know I got a mani/pedi today at the nail salon on 81st and 37thave (sorry, can&#039;t remember the name!) and ended up getting my mani done with &quot;shellac&quot; (spelling may be wrong) It is awesome, I&#039;ll update you but my sister gets it done and apparently it DOES not chip.

				I might have asked before but is there any place that someone can recommend for a decent, low-price blowout?<br /><br />Also, I used to frequent the nail salon on 73rd near northern boulevard (I forget the name but it is right across the street from the bus stop) but have stopped going because the owner is so mean to her workers.&nbsp; Every few weeks, there were new ladies working there.&nbsp; They all always looked sad and I once heard the owner telling a young girl who worked there that she could only take her lunch break after five hours of work.&nbsp; I asked some workers why other people left and they always looked uncomfortable and said that it was really hard to work with that owner.&nbsp; Also, two of the workers I talked to told me that they were working there pro bono for a month because the owner had promised them that once they went through &quot;training&quot; they could have their own mani/pedi chair.&nbsp; Of course, once the month passed those workers disappeared.&nbsp; I feel bad and want to do something but so far, the only action I have taken is to stop going there.<br /><br /><br />

				I would like to put in a good word for Peter, who runs For Your Hair on 76th near Roosevelt, and his associate Patricia who does nails. This is a down-home and friendly neighborhood place and even if it isn&#039;t fancy, the services rival what you might get in Manhattan -- but at a much more affordable price. I&#039;ve been in the area for five years and was wary of the &quot;big hair&quot; look I saw at many local places. So I was schlepping to a hipster place on the LES....but when a neighbor showed up with a really nice haircut, I found that this local joint suits me to a T.

				He is a talented hairdresser - I found good reviews on yelp so I thought I would give him a try when my usual place (lisa at sheer success) was booked and I needed a cut asap.&nbsp; I was wary at first for the opposite reason of above postings, there&#039;s a barber&#039;s pole on the outside of the building so I was afraid he would be more of a &quot;man&#039;s&quot; hairdresser than a woman&#039;s.&nbsp; But he did a lovely job (with my curly hair, which is a miracle).&nbsp; They guy doing shampoos could use a few lessons on being more gentle, but Peter was good, and that&#039;s what counts :)

				after a lot of trial and error, i&#039;ve settled on Bellagio on Roosevelt and 76th. the technicians do good work, and the place is quite clean, probably the cleanest i&#039;ve seen in the neighborhood, particularly the pedicure chairs. i&#039;ve never done acrylics there, but the mani-pedi work is really good. there&#039;s a woman who does facials as well, which i&#039;ve only done once, but it was a good experience.<br /><br />
