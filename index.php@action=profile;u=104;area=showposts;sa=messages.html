					I totally disagree with the view that benches should be limited/eliminated just because some people loiter on them &quot;inappropriately.&quot;&nbsp; While I get annoyed at kids trampling my front lawn or dog walkers allowing their dogs on it ... and a little less annoyed (but still annoyed) when I see young lovers necking on or in front of my stoop at night, I welcome the occasional elderly or physically disabled or just tired, package-bearing adult whom I find sitting on my stoop during daylight hours.&nbsp; The person usually apologizes and offers to leave and I reply that he or she is welcome to stay and rest.&nbsp; That is what a public bench is for, and I do not mind the occasional use of my private stoop for that purpose.&nbsp; Where are those &quot;quality of life&quot; police officers to deal with bench denizens who are behaving inappropriately?&nbsp; And when did snoozing on a bench become such an offense?&nbsp; Other than the risk of having one&#039;s pocket picked, a nap on a bench in Central Park is one of the joys of city life.<br />- Miggie on 86th St.

					My family moved to Jackson Heights from Woodside in 1962, but prior to that we visited Jackson Heights quite frequently to shop, dine out and go to the movies.&nbsp; &quot;The building that currently houses The Renaissance Charter School on 37th ave between 81st and 82nd used to be C&amp;S a horrible department store that no one ever went to&quot; was, for many years prior to that, a quite popular department store called Fields.&nbsp; It gave out distinctive black and white shopping bags and was there for as long as I can remember (back through the early &#039;50&#039;s.)&nbsp; May its memory live on !!<br /><br />&nbsp; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=64.msg250.html#msg250">Quote from: Aronan on November 23, 2007, 08:47:54 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m born and raised in Jackson Heights. <br /><br />I went to PS 69 and IS 145 when they were literally half the size they are now. <br /><br />Across the St. from PS 69 there used to be a Sizzler where the Jewish Community Center now stands. <br /><br />The liquor store mentioned above was actually on 73rd st. It was Sam&#039;s Liquor Store, Sam always&nbsp; gave me pennies when I went in there with my father. <br /><br />On the corner of 73rd St. and 37th road where Kabbab King is now, there used to be a place called Dumbarton Oaks, it was a stripper bar but prior to that it was actually a respectable restaurant (or so I&#039;ve been told).<br /><br />On the same block just past the Eagle (or Earle) theater there was a pizza shop, Benny and Tony were the father son team that ran the place. Sal&#039;s barber shop (now on 76th st.) was also there. Sal still cuts my hair some times. A tiny little deli that never seemed to do any business, and The Magic Touch an old style gay bar. Across the st. there was a type writer repair show. which lasted for the longest time and I believe was replaced by a travel agent. <br /><br />Going west on Broadway where the Korean Market is now, there used to be an A&amp;P.<br /><br />One more block west at 72nd and Broadway there was Gibbons, an Irish bar &amp; restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over to 37th ave. near 79th St. where Novo currently is was Barrs Toy store. Next to it where the Starbucks is allegedly going was a bridal shop.<br /><br />On the South side of 37th ave between 74th and 75th there was a Carvel Ice Cream store. <br /><br />The building that currently houses The Renaissance Charter School on 37th ave between 81st and 82nd used to be C&amp;S a horrible department store that no one ever went to.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a candy store on the South East corner of 82nd St. <br /><br />The Woolworth&#039;s on 82nd st. was indeed 2 floors and had a diner in it. <br /><br />On Northern Boulevard next to the Mark Twain Diner there used to be an Arby&#039;s.&nbsp; Where Rite Aid is now there was a C-Town. <br /><br />On 76th St. just behind a small car lot there used to be Northern Lanes. Our other bowling alley. <br /><br />Natives on 83rd and Northern used to be a movie theatre. <br /><br />That&#039;s all that comes to mind at the moment.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
