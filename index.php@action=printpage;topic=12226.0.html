			<dd class="postbody">
				So, about 7 years after I posted here on this board about my plans to renovate my kitchen, I finally did it!!&nbsp; I had a really wonderful and reasonably priced contractor who guided me through the entire thing and did careful, tasteful, accurate work.&nbsp; If you would like to contact him about your own jobs, his name is Robert Roses and he can be reached at (deleted)&nbsp; <br /><br />He does all types of interiors.&nbsp; I was lucky to find him -- I first heard of him here on this board, but I also found an architect&#039;s blog that credited him for contracting work and that&#039;s what inspired me to contact him.&nbsp; Frances Temple-West Architect, Jackson Heights Kitchen (http://templewestarchitect.com/jackson-heights-kitchen--bath)<br /><br />I am attaching some pics of my own kitchen.

				It looks amazing! I&#039;m just starting my kitchen reno so this gives me hope that it&#039;ll all be worth it :) Did you get your counter top at Ikea as well? Also - just out of curiosity - why did you choose the hard wood floors over tile?

				I have to admit, I haven&#039;t done a white kitchen in while unless I was asked to...so I decided to do one after seen yours.&nbsp; I guess I found new faith in white kitchens after seen yours.&nbsp; I think we have done close to 200 kitchens.&nbsp; Most of them cookie cutters I admit but we try to do what we can with whatever budget the landlords allows.<div align="center"><br />(http://i.picasion.com/pic78/73a1033c4cb0ff92d9acc40c2a365a82.gif)<br /><br />(http://i.picasion.com/pic78/b4d3e0389c5fce71a29146a996f84bc0.gif)</div><br />This Picture doesn&#039;t show the finish product I just noticed.&nbsp; I put a Grecian bull nose a few days ago to give it a cleaner look on the side walls.<br /><div style="text-align: right;">(http://i.picasion.com/pic78/b07b3f3b10d9abbec5c6fdab39d05f1a.gif)<br />The steel Beams didn&#039;t allow me to fully open the top of the room so we did what we could with them. I prefer the taller wall cabinets of course..<br /><br />(http://i.picasion.com/pic78/3f72240e74271b9d9015c6e81d2fdd1f.gif)<br /></div><br />I added an under the counter water filtration system which I recommend to anyone redoing their kitchens.&nbsp; The filters last 2 or 3 times as long and the water flows twice as fast vs the fridge.&nbsp; I still hooked up the fridge one because of the ice, but I think I&#039;m doing this from now on.<br />
