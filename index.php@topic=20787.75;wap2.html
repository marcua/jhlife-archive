			<br />--- Quote from: itsit on December 23, 2021, 07:51:21 PM --- It would be a beautiful Christmas present to have all parties involved recognize the plusses and the problematic regarding the 34th Ave Open Streets project.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />The Open Street of 34th Ave is a fantastic Christmas present to the people of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Thank you, Santa...and whoever else is involved in the fabulous project. <br /><br />It&#039;s a most wonderful Christmas gift during these pandemic times to be out in the open where it&#039;s safe...and not stuck indoors where it&#039;s less safe.

And this site won&#039;t be around for me to gloat about it!
