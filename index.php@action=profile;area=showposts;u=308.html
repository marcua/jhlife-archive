					I&#039;ve always wondered why the Greystones weren&#039;t built around a single street block and were instead built on both sides of 80th street.&nbsp; My understanding is that each side has their own private garden not shared with the rest of the block.&nbsp; Why not build it like the Chateau or the Towers.&nbsp; Any one know the answer?

					I agree with jmp99.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with discussing the practices of local real estate firms <span class="bbc_u">by name</span>, whether the practice is good or bad.&nbsp; If NYC Native wants to be professionally courteous to his fellow brokers, that is certainly his choice.&nbsp; From my reading of jmp99&#039;s posts, there was no attempt to smear the character of any realtor.&nbsp; Even if jmp99 did discuss local real estate firms by name, jmp99 simply wrote about his or her understanding of the practices of local real estate firms.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think NYC Native again avoided the question of whether local real estate firms engage in anti-competitive practices.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the questions posed was: Whether local real estate agents engage in the practice of screening out offers or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by other local real estate agents.<br /><br />This question relates to anti-competitive behavior and possibly antitrust issues because if local brokers will only work with other local brokers in an (whether intentional or not) to keep larger agencies and non-local brokers from competing in JH, then the result may be: (1) sellers may not see a better offer (or even a higher offer) simply because a potential buyer was not represented by a local broker; (2) buyers won&#039;t have access to the market of JH properties without having to go through a local broker; (3) non-local brokers are unwilling to compete in marketing JH properties because they know they are being shut out by local brokers....all three results are a detriment to sellers and buyers alike!&nbsp; <br /><br />My reading of NYC Native&#039;s response seems to be that local brokers are somehow more likely to produce buyers that are <span class="bbc_u">serious </span> in their decision to buy and are more <span class="bbc_u">financially qualified</span>.&nbsp; This just does not seem true to me.&nbsp; First, asking a potential buyer to produce a letter from the bank to show that the potential buyer is pre-qualified is something ANY broker (local or non-local) can ask for.&nbsp; No one on this thread even suggested that a broker asking for a pre-qualification letter was somehow engaging in anything illegal or anti-competitive.&nbsp; So, NYC Native, this is not a matter of seeing things &quot;from your angle&quot;.&nbsp; Second, taking Manhattan as an example, I don&#039;t think a broker that works mostly in the Upper East Side is somehow going to produce buyers that are any more serious than buyers being represented by brokers that work mostly in Soho.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, my conclusion seems to be that NYC Native is dodging the question about possible anti-competitive behaviours by local brokers and trying to characterize the discussions on this thread as some kind of slander against individual local brokers.&nbsp; This is simply not the case.<br /><br />I&#039;d be HAPPY (even ecstatic)to find out that local brokers are NOT engaging in anti-competitive behavior.&nbsp; But if this is true, I&#039;d like it to be backed up by a little more than arguments such as (a) &quot;theories&quot; don&#039;t pan out, and (b) this discussion is &quot;trash talking&quot; other people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					NYC Native, I tried to follow your discussion and rebuttal to jmp99â€™s post.&nbsp; <br /><br />From my reading, jmp99â€™s overall suggestion to sellers is to maximize their sale price AND decrease time on the market by exposing the property to the most number of potential buyers.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, jmp99 suggested utilizing the service of larger real estate agencies that are willing to share the commission with any broker.<br /><br />With all due respect to you, jmp99â€™s post did not state that only realtors from the larger agencies can become a member of the multiple listing service (MLS).&nbsp; In fact, unless Iâ€™m mistaken, jmp99â€™s post did not discuss the MLS at all.&nbsp; Therefore, your lengthy critique of the MLS is probably not that relevant (perhaps even irrelevant) to your rebuttal to jmp99â€™s post.<br /><br />However, since you did post some of your opinions regarding the MLS, I will also jump in with my thoughts on the subject.&nbsp; You stated that you were against â€œthe falsehood and attempt to mystify membership to the MLSâ€.&nbsp; While I can certainly see that MLS realtors may not be any more professional than those not on the MLS, I believe (and correct me if Iâ€™m wrong), the chief criticism of the MLS from the consumer standpoint is the very anticompetitive nature in which they are set up.&nbsp; More than a few MLS systems have been targets of federal antitrust law suits because of their anticompetitive nature that renders a great disservice to consumers.&nbsp; Agents willing to take smaller commissions have been barred from the MLS, along with agents willing to provide less than the full range of service typically provided by realtors.&nbsp; Internet-based real estate agencies have also been barred from joining the MLS.&nbsp; All this seems to be missing from your critique of the MLS.&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, I donâ€™t really see your point about jmp99 being â€œdead wrongâ€ about local realtorâ€™s unwillingness to work with other real estate agents and their desire to keep the full commission.&nbsp; You stated yourself that local realtors co-broker properties but only with other local brokers.&nbsp; This seems to the PERFECT example of the anti-competitive nature of local real estate agents that jmp99 is complaining about!&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I wonder how many local real estate agents go to the trouble of explaining to their client (the seller) that the agent will go ahead and screen out any offers (regardless of the quality of the offer) or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by the few local agencies in JH.&nbsp; That hardly seems in line with a real estate agentâ€™s fiduciary duty to a client-seller, unless it is fully disclosed up front.&nbsp; HOW MANY SELLERS WOULD BE WILLING TO IGNORE AN OFFER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WASNâ€™T BROUGHT TO THEM BY A LOCAL REALTOR?&nbsp; I CERTAINLY WOULDNâ€™T!<br /><br />I also disagree with your defense of local real estate agents over agents from larger city-wide agencies.&nbsp; There are certainly some agents from larger agencies that are simply clueless, but I just donâ€™t see the supposed advantage that local brokers can provide.&nbsp; You seem to suggest that local brokers have the inside scoop on buildings and will somehow make the sale go smoothly.&nbsp; Speaking as a co-op board member myself, I think that is a much too generous advantage you seem to award yourself.&nbsp; A prospective buyerâ€™s financials comes first and will always be paramount in my building.&nbsp; No real estate agent can miraculously help the process in my opinion when it comes to a prospective buyerâ€™s financialsâ€¦no matter what kind of inside scoop they think they might be in possession of.&nbsp; Also, being pre-qualified means nothing to a co-op board.&nbsp; It may indicate to an agent that a prospective buyer is serious, but a year ago, even a door-knob can get pre-qualifiedâ€¦that has no bearing on a buyerâ€™s ability to pay his/her mortgage!&nbsp; Therefore, the advantages that a local real estate agent may provide in terms of his ability to get the inside scoop is minimal at best!&nbsp; A hard-working agent from the larger agencies can get a hold of such information too!<br /><br />Your arguments seem largely based on what is good for you and other local brokers.&nbsp; As jmp99 points out, YOUR INTERESTS AS A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT MAY NOT BE ALIGNED WITH A SELLERâ€™S INTEREST!&nbsp; It might be a terrible waste of your time and resources to show an apartment to someone who is only window shopping or not pre-qualified, but a seller really cares primarily about getting the highest price in the least amount of time!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					Perhaps CCTVs would have helped catched the shooter (...I doubt it it though), but I don&#039;t think it would have helped much with the overall problems ailing Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; In my opinion, for JH city officials to recommend that NYPD and the city install cameras on Roosevelt Ave is like recommending a Band-Aid for a bullet wound.&nbsp; It simply sounds like the city officials that represent JH is passing the buck to the NYPD!&nbsp; I don&#039;t like budget cuts to the police department any more than the next person, but the situation on Roosevelt didn&#039;t get to this point yesterday...its been a long time coming, no?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Who licensed the shady bars and strip joints on Roosevelt Ave?!?&nbsp; If we (collectively) allow such establishments to exist during good times, why should we be surprised that things may get ugly during economic downturns?<br /><br />If these establishments didn&#039;t exist on Roosevelt Ave, perhaps we would have less problems.&nbsp; The shooting is probably just the tip of the iceberg that is the most visible to us...if the drug, prostitution, fake ID, etc problems are tackled first, there would probably be a decrease in more violent crimes too.&nbsp; Even tackling lifestyle issues such as excessive honking, double parking, ear-shattering music from passing cars may help!&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m being silly, but if a person is constantly getting ticketed for his excessive honking, double parking and ear-shattering music as he is passing through JH to get to Roosevelt Ave, he might not go through JH as often! <br />

					I picked up half a chicken yesterday, with two sides.<br /><br />Original American Chicken may have to rethink the ventilation system they&#039;ve installed...it was very smoky (from the grilling) inside the restaurant.&nbsp; Maybe it was just the first day and the ventilation system just wan&#039;t up and running yet.<br /><br />The chicken was moist, and overall good, but not great.&nbsp; The sauces (tomato and bbq) weren&#039;t very good at all.&nbsp; The sides weren&#039;t very good either.&nbsp; A great sauce and some good sides may have made all the difference...it didn&#039;t look like the restaurant cared about these things.&nbsp; Oh well, I&#039;ll go back and revisit them in a few weeks and see if things have improved.

					I wonder how the new e77 computer policy is working out?&nbsp; <br /><br />If the place is still packed with laptops...is it because (1) the barristas are not or are unwilling to enforce their new policy, OR (2) laptop users are indeed getting up every so ofter to purchase more drinks OR (3) both?&nbsp; If so, then how does this improve the situation?!?&nbsp; <br /><br />I can totally understand why the management/barristas don&#039;t want to get involved in throwing people out of the shop...I read the &quot;third place&quot; article too, and it does seem like e77 is set up to be that kind of place.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still kind of like the idea of only allowing 3 laptops in the shop at any given time.&nbsp; That way, laptop users will police themselves...incoming laptop customers will naturally &quot;push&quot; out the sitting laptop users...its a simple self-policing method that doesn&#039;t involve the shop proprietors being stern with any particular customer!&nbsp; Other customers without laptops and looking for a place to sit won&#039;t have to compete with laptop users either...well, because there can be only 3 laptops in the shop at any given time...simple as ONE, TWO, and THREE.&nbsp; Oh well, what do I know about running a coffee shop...clearly e77 did their research on the subject.

					Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Speaking for myself, I hope at the end of this conversation, Espresso 77 comes out for the better.&nbsp; I want to see this neighborhood gem do well.<br /><br />Patrons of e77 that bring their laptops in and treat e77 as their personal office for the whole day whilst only buying a cup of small coffee is probably not the kind of business that will allow e77 to thrive.<br /><br />BUT, I&#039;m not sure it is all that useful to characterize <span class="bbc_u">every </span> patron with a laptop in this manner.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen two laptop users sharing a table.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen laptop patrons getting up every 30 minutes to buy another cup of coffee (while making a pitstop at the loo).&nbsp; I would argue that it is much too easy to characterize every patron with a laptop as the source of the problem simply because they are the most <span class="bbc_u">visible </span> in a very tight space.&nbsp; <br /><br />If achieving a high-turnover is our <span class="bbc_u">only </span> concern, shouldn&#039;t e77 be worrying about the mothers and nannies that drag in their kids - occupying more than one seat - while only ordering a cup of coffee?&nbsp; (Let&#039;s not even discuss the screaming that those &quot;awful&quot; kids do that can drive other patrons up the wall)&nbsp; What about the older patrons who seem to hold court both inside and on the benches outside e77 during the day whilst nursing their one cup of coffee...how do they contribute to e77&#039;s bottom line?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Suggestions made above such as posting a sign limiting computer usage to 30 minutes reminds me of fast food chains like McDonalds.&nbsp; Treating laptop patrons like the homeless and vagrants that camp out at McD seem a little extreme.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, I certainly don&#039;t want the nice granny enjoying her cup of coffee on a sunny afternoon to be booted out of the shop after 30 minutes.&nbsp; Why should the 30 minute limit apply only to computer users?<br /><br />In my opinion, there is nothing &quot;cool&quot; about laptops at a coffeeshop per se, but it is the diversity of people visiting a store that serves a quality product that makes e77 cool.&nbsp; Young and old, laptop and non-laptop, etc, etc makes e77 cool.&nbsp; This mix of people and the energy they create...and not just the brightly colored walls and artwork makes e77 an attractive store to go plop down 3 dollars for a cup of beverage.&nbsp; <br /><br />And for those that are &quot;put off&quot; by the computer users at e77, I know of other people who avoid shops like Lety&#039;s and Dunkin Donuts because they think its used by the senior residents of JH as a lounge.&nbsp; <br /><br />My suggestion would be to limit the number of laptop users at e77 to perhaps 3 patrons at any given time.&nbsp; That way, laptop users continue to contribute to the diversity of e77 while making a less significant impact on turnover rate and seats occupied.&nbsp; Those that use e77 as their office will be constantly asked by incoming patrons carrying laptops how much longer they were planning to stay.&nbsp; Plus, the nice barristas at e77 won&#039;t have to become &quot;hall monitors&quot; with stop watches.&nbsp; <br />For me, I love the diversity...best illustrated by the past two story hours at e77...moms, dads and kids, older folks...all with drinks in hand...and a few laptop patrons sprinkled in for good measure!
