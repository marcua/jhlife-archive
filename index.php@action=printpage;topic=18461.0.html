				In Denmark, they are implementing separate compartments in trash containers for refundables.<br /><br />So that people who collect these bottles, cans, etc for money have easy access to them and thus don&#039;t have to spill garbage all over the street in their search for the refundables.&nbsp; <br /><br />NYC, this is a great idea. And one we need. <br /><br />(Perhaps refundables can also be separated in domestic garbage too? So folks don&#039;t split open the garbage bags and make a mess in their search?)

				Is this a problem? People go through my building&#039;s recycling bags like clockwork to pull out the refundable bottles, and l never notice the rest of the recycling being strewn about. They seem to actually be pretty careful about it -- I assume so no one gives them any grief about going through the recycling.

				&nbsp;Our super actually has an arrangement with a woman he lets in to go through the refundables before he does the final<br />bagging. Not sure what the nature of the transaction is but it makes less volume go out in the bags and I don&#039;t see our<br />recyclable bags cut open as others look for cans and bottles. But the separate container is an excellent idea!!!

				i&#039;ve seen the same couple of ladies collect ours for almost 20 years, never an issue with mess. they&#039;re very careful. <br /><br />but yes, having it institutionalized (or whatever) would be a good idea. in Montreal, the street corner cans are all divided in four, and it works very well.

				Here&#039;s another angle, though. Right now, there are people who are eager to go to the effort of rummaging through the bags so they can find refundables to turn in. In a sense, they work for it. If the refundables are in a separate bag, the first person who comes along and wants some spare change can take them with no effort. If someone is needy enough that they&#039;re willing to dig through the bags, I&#039;d rather see that person make the profit.
