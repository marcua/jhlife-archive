			<strong>20th Century Boy</strong>:
			<br />
			Named telephone exchanges are relics of a bygone era; then again, so am I. The Jackson Heights exchanges I remember from the period before the conversion to numbered exchanges in the 1960&#039;s are: DEfender, HAvemeyer, HIckory, ILlinois, NEwtown and TWining. &nbsp;Can anybody remember any others?

			There&#039;s some discussion on the topic of telephone exchanges at the following thread:<br /><br />You know you&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights a long time ...<br /><br />It&#039;s been a while since the last post there, so am now wondering if anyone has any more fun information to share on the topic.
