				by:Anthony J Trimboli Likes Western Queens and Brooklyn- What do you think of the bus service in Western Queens areas like Jackson Heights, Astoria, Sunnyside, and even areas like the East side of Manhattan across the bay??? Hah. That is some pretty good service by MTA Bus. Where I live, in Howard Beach, the service has improved a little since the MTA took it over, but it is still the same type of service. Today, I was riding on MTA Bus, the Q11 and as if Howard Beach and some other areas are full of electrical wires down, the bus today had an electrical wire that was down in the back of the bus. It was sort of blocking the back door. According to FDNY Office of Inspection, electrical wires in strange spots should be reported to 311, 911, or perhaps who is in charge of them. A bus on the Q 11 went out of service today because I reported the electrical wire slightly blocking the back door on the bus. Besides that, you have buses which were mostly Triboro Coach and Queens Surface up there. You should see how impressive these buses are. You see them almost everywhere around these areas including Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side across the bay. Wow. In some areas, the bus service is no good. You go out to Eastern Queens like Douglaston and Bayside and you have long waits for the bus to come, the area is a little bit like a farm a commercialzied farm and that continues all the way down Northern Blvd to Centereach to a certain degree and you have LONG waits for buses out there!!!!! I can not believe how well the bus service is over in certain areas like yours and Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side. Wow. Very good service. If you talk about Long Island Bus, it is a bad wait and so are some buses East on Northern Blvd. Those areas out there are after Flushing, New York heading East are mostly commercial straight until Centereach to a degree, so there may be more people taking cars out there, but the bus service in some areas can be bad compared to how it is in Astoria, Jackson Heights, and even across the bay on the East Side.

				See, here&#039;s the thing.&nbsp; I love to walk, though of the last two years I do it less and less (and my waistline shows it :( ).<br /><br />But some mornings, as I walk down 35th Avenue, especially if I have my hands full of three or four shopping bags of teaching materials, I will stop at the 49 (nee 19B) bus top and wait for the bus.&nbsp; And 3 out of 5 times, the front heavy buses shoot right by.&nbsp; Sometimes two in a row.<br /><br />I say front heavy because the drivers must think these buses are full.&nbsp; In fact, though sometimes they are legitmately full, there are ones where the front has people standing tight, but the back aisle is free and clear.&nbsp; No one moves back, the drivers, perhaps eager to get done sooner, don&#039;t enforce that, and feel justified in not stopping.<br /><br />Now I can walk, and usually do if I see one go by, but I leave at the stop people who can&#039;t (eldery, disabled clients from the satellite apratment in my building, parenst with young kids) and I think it&#039;s horrible how underserved the area is.&nbsp; The buses fill up (or at least appear to, in the cases above) so quickly in the 80s that by the time they reach they 70s, they go right on by.<br /><br />I have spoken to the MTA twice on twice (and Triboro before that, when it was still responsible for the 19B), and was told all buses MUST stop if they are not totally full.&nbsp; Usually after I use the website complaint, and get my confirmation, they seem to serve the area better for about 2 - 3weeks, then it starts again ...<br /><br />I totally recommend anyone in similar circumstances use the MTA complaint form as well.&nbsp; They may add an appropriate number of buses if everyone did ...

				by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, a fellow member was telling me that he was having problems with the MTA Website due to overcrowding of buses up there in Jackson Heights. Yes, I agree with him. I have used the MTA Website and it is really bad. Do they listen??? I think they are very busy or something at the MTA website. They do not really listen to me neither. They do not listen to letters or anything like that. I think they are just busy or something, like they will listen to your topic for a couple of weeks, dependant on the importance and then just forget about the topic because they have a brand new one to focus on. You should see how bad the New York City Transit website is. I think the best thing to do perhaps is just try to tell a driver about the problems. The sites are too busy in my opinion, especially New York City Transit for example.Too busy an amount of sites. Honestly. They are busy. They will listen to your topic like for one day if it is not important. Try to get the driver&#039;s attention and see if he or she listens or something. That is the best advice. I was sorry to hear this.

				I don&#039;t usually ride buses, only subways, so can&#039;t comment on that.&nbsp; <br /><br />But I will say that I found the MTA&#039;s change in how they do weekend advisory alerts about trackwork and diversions extremely confusing.&nbsp; I used to get a weekly email with a summary of the work on the lines I requested (E,F and 7).&nbsp; When they revamped their website, for some reason they were unable to continue giving me weekend advisories without me going on to the site, creating an account, choosing a password, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried several times to sign up for what are now called &quot;Planned Service Outages&quot; yet I still don&#039;t seem to get notified.&nbsp; Instead all I seem to get is emails about sick passengers, power outages, police investigations etc.&nbsp; I just tried going into my account to change my selection so that I get notified <strong>only</strong> about the planned outages, but the system doesn&#039;t allow me to make this change.<br /><br />It&#039;s really convoluted.&nbsp; At this point I am only being notified about the things I don&#039;t want to know about.<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problem?

				by:Anthony J Trimboli- I AGREE SO MUCH!!!! Track work is horrible by me. I live in Howard Beach, which is OK as an area but I like Western Queens better. Howard Beach is OK and you have the A Train there. They have this track diversion where you have to get off the A Train at Utica Avenue and get a bus upstairs to Downtown Brooklyn and take the bus to High Street and then get back on to the train again just to get to Manhattan for volunteer work or for enjoyment. Not only do I not like the A Train, I like trains like the R and V and F much much better, this diversion is ridiculous on the A Train by me. You live where buses can get you to a location, I have the Q60 which I rode on yesterday to get me into Manhattan. The R train is not bad either nor are the other trains around there!!!!! I mean I agree with you on the strange diversions the MTA has with trains, especially this one on the A Train. I do not really care for the A Train, however, in the least bit compared to trains by you like the N and R and 7, etc. Better service or something....

				I don&#039;t have much complaints about bus service, but like Shelby, I don&#039;t ride the bus that often.&nbsp; Overall, I&#039;d say that when all buses and subways are running smoothly, you can&#039;t beat our public transportation system.&nbsp; There really aren&#039;t many limits on where one can travel within the City.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just last week I decided to experiment on a new route to New Hyde Park to meet-up with my sister.&nbsp; I took the E train to Union Turnpike and then took the Q46 bus heading toward LIJ.&nbsp; OK, so I then had to switch to another bus (N25), but I did manage to reach my destination in approximately 1 1/4 hours of travel time.&nbsp; Not too bad overall considering that Long Island is not exactly easily traveled via public transportation.

			<dd class="postbody">
				by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, that is so true about bus service in Queens. You can get around easy with them. One reason for that, my dad told me is like the Q46 may be that way because people who live out in Glen Oaks, New York or Lake Success out in Nassau County, New York may NEED to get to the New York City Subways. The same applies to routes that are in other eastern areas like Springfield Gardens, these people need a bus to go up Merrick Blvd and even part of Merrick Rd and Valley Stream to get them to the necessary subway to get them to Manhattan. Yes, bus service, especially in Queens can be that way, especially all the way out there. If you look at many New York City Transit bus routes they all go from the farms out there to the major areas where you can pick up buses like Jamaica Terminal or Queens Boulevard, for example because the people out there need public transportation to get them from Queens or even Western Nassau County, like the bus around Green Acres Mall to get to the necessary subways. yes, I agree with you on that. I think the buses and their routes out there are even more reliant in Eastern Queens and part of Western Nassau County, New York than where you are where you have trains also on top of buses. My dad told me this once. People rely on these buses.

				This is true about eastern Queens.&nbsp; The school I teach at is so far out, we can walk 3 blocks in two directions to Nassau.&nbsp; Needless to say the fastest NYC MTA way is the F train to 179th (last stop), change for the Q43 for a long ride.&nbsp; But the buses are so crowded by 179th, they skip it (highs chool kids going Van Buren).&nbsp; The solution is to get off the F at Sutphin (4th to last stop), and catch the bus before it fills up for an even longer bus ride.<br /><br />Luckily a non driver like me has car pooled all these years ...<br /><br />When I don&#039;t have the ride, I do the train bus thing.&nbsp; Lately though, I spoil myself with the LIRR ... Woodside to Floral Park in 25 minutes, or Jamiaca to Floral park in 9 (after hopping the E), then a 15 minute walk up Little Neck back into Queens.

				by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, the buses out there are for that reason. Yes. I know that there are no subways around but you do have a Long Island Bus a while up if you walk to Hillside Avenue, but even that does not connect you to any buses that go around your area, I do not know of any Long Island Bus that connects with the Q60 or something like that.<br /><br />I think the planners in the area decided to make the buses that way to just get people to various interesting locations around Manhattan and Queens so they could travel without subways.<br /><br />Again, there is a Long Island Bus about a block away from there and that does connect to NYC Subways that go around where you are, I think. You have to walk to Archer Avenue.

				by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. The buses have that more where they have announcements that are outdated on the bus and subway that tell you special announcements. I have no idea why New York City Transit keeps old announcements out there to be posted to others. They should at least know to remove the special announcements that are old or outdated not to confuse the passenger. But, they have been doing that for years with putting announcements in trains and buses that are old and outdated in nature. I have no idea why they would do so. They are sloppy that way at New York City Transit I guess. I have no idea why they keep outdated announcements, I know they have problems sometimes cleaning the trains and buses and leaving litter on them for a week, maybe they have no time to get the old announcements down-- I know some subway lines like the A and C Trains keep the litter on the floor of the train for about a week in some instances. They actually do that with platforms and trains sometimes on the A and C Lines--it is only by the lines by me too.

I&#039;m sure they have some formula somewhere that dictates when a new map is merited. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think the maps are a significant expense in terms of the entire MTA budget, so reducing the frequency oif publication or eliminating them all together wouldn&#039;t have a real impact.

I just do not think it is worth the time and money to produce a large announcement about sick passengers on the train. is everybody really this sick on the train??? If they are sick, they can get off for certain at the next stop and get off rather than have New York City Transit produce announcements like those. Those are a waste of money, yes. i agree with you on that.
