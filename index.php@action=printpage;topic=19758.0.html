				Good evening everybody. As we are trying to cope with these extraordinary times in which we live, my roommate and I have taken to extensive cooking. I am Italian-American (my mother is from Verona) with extensive experience living in Mexico, and my roommate is half-colombian, half-Venezuelan, with experience working in high-end restaurants around NYC. Yesterday we kicked around the idea of giving digital cooking lessons and doing local delivery of home-cooked food. Within 24 hours, we already accumulated a handful of orders for both. So, I wanted to pitch this to the community here. As of right now, here is our menu for delivery:<br /><br />- Northern Italian style meat sauce with Ground Turkey trot Pancetta<br />- Bean and Kale Stew<br />- Caldo de Gallina<br />- Chicken Chorizo with Risotto Milanese

				how is this &quot;trust&quot; established on an anonymous message board?<br /><br />&quot;f somebody trusts me enough to buy food from me I will continue to sell to them.&quot;<br /><br />and break the law. congrats, this board is now being used to promote ADMITTED criminal behavior, and solicit more of it!<br /><br />mods. can you ban this person?<br /><br />&quot;Right now NYS has bigger fish to fry anyway.&quot;<br /><br />wait for this excuse from others. you&#039;ll love it then!<br /><br />in addition, why should restaurants, and food carts, who have obeyed the law - and have paid to follow hygiene laws ..,...and are now suffering have to compete with you?

				Posted by JA: &quot;Yesterday we kicked around the idea of giving digital cooking lessons and doing local delivery of home-cooked food. Within 24 hours, we already accumulated a handful of orders for both. So, I wanted to pitch this to the community here.&quot;<br /><br />I remembered correctly. You had offered to make/sell your sauces here awhile ago.<br /><br />Checking your posts, I see you know a lot about certain ethnic foods.<br /><br />What does <em>trot </em>mean?<br /><br />Good luck to you.
