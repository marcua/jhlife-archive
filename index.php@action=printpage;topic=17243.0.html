				These sweethearts lost their mom unexpectedly, and we want to help find them a loving home. Read about them below, and if you know of a good family for them, let us know!....<br /><br />Banjo and moon are closely bonded brothers that were adopted from the ASPCA last year. They are six years old and they love people. Banjo is especially friendly and climbs in your lap as soon as he meets you and loves belly rubs. Moon is friendly too, though a tad more independent. They are tiny - about 7 pounds each. They must be indoor cats. They are healthy and eat Prescription Diet food. They are a type of polydactyl - they have a few extra toes which just makes them cuter.<br /><br />We have a lot of cat “accessories” – a practically new cat tree, food bowls, litter boxes, lots of toys, and even cat shelves which were never installed. The cats also have pet insurance which can be directly transferred to the new owner(s) if they want. <br />
