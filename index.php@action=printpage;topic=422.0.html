				Avela, I think the benches were removed because they were attracting people who would spend the better part of the day sleeping on them and littering the surrounding area with empty bottles.&nbsp; I miss those benches and would love to seem them return.&nbsp; Only this time, it would be nice to be able to have a seat every now and then and do some people watching.

				On the other hand, anybody can use Central Park, Grand Central Station, and Bryant Park, and they aren&#039;t too shabby.&nbsp; They just have people who tend to them and make sure they remain inviting to all.&nbsp; Perhaps in partnership with the 115th Precinct, the community can work out a way to prevent our street benches (if replaced) from becoming sleeping spots.

				I totally agree.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know that previously we had benches there, but I&#039;ve often thought that the space is wasted.&nbsp; With park space in our neighborhood so limited, we should make the most possible of every public space.<br /><br />I&#039;m sympathetic to the homeless, but surely there are some legal means that can be used to prevent &quot;camping out&quot; and it goes without saying that public urination is not legal. :police:<br /><br />I also wish we had some restaurants with sidewalk seating, but that&#039;s a discussion for a different thread... ;)

				There are some creative ways to use space that work to discourage loitering of the kind folks are talking about. Consider Bryant Park - it used to be a poorly designed space that encouraged vagrancy, but is now a place that encourages use by regular folks (which in turn serves to discourage use by drunks). Partnership for Public Spaces is a good NYC-based non-profit that helps communities brainstorm about design solutions that work for spaces like this. It IS possible.

				Why not the shop owners on 82nd St.&nbsp; How much does a bench cost and how many benches do you have on 82nd St.&nbsp; We&#039;re probably taking about $20 a shop owner.&nbsp; It would also make sense if Bank of America purchased and maintained all the benches with a sign on each bench, &quot;Courtesy of Bank of America.&quot;&nbsp;

				Whoever is responsible, they should put metal vs. wooden benches back to replace the broken ones we have now and more of them.&nbsp; I would love to see more stores on 37th Ave. have a bench out in front that they take into the store at night.&nbsp; Some places do this and, not only is it good for business, I think is gives a place more of a neighborhood feeling.&nbsp; It was very sad when they had to remove all the benches from the front of the Post Office.&nbsp; Although they eventually attracted a rowdy and messy bunch of drunks, they also served as a nice place for older folks to sit and socialize.

				I think Aronan is on the right track here in terms of what entity is responsible for maintaining the benches on 82nd street.&nbsp; It is likely DOT or perhaps the 82nd Street BID.&nbsp; I am pretty certain it isn&#039;t the Parks Dept.<br /><br />Broadly speaking, benches are a bit of a tricky amenity.&nbsp; Many people like the convenience and small town feel benches give.&nbsp; But they can also be a beacon for unwanted behavior.&nbsp; The benches at the Post Office ended up being pretty problematic.&nbsp; <br /><br />And if the benches aren&#039;t properly maintained they are just an eyesore.&nbsp; Or worse they can be a hazard.

				Noticed there are now some benches outside post office on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Once the weather gets nice like today, always look for chance to sit outside.&nbsp; Would be nice if more benches are placed throughout neighborhood, doesn&#039;t seem like much movement in having outdoor cafes.&nbsp; Guess it means heading to Astoria and other hoods to enjoy eating al fresco.

				This is great news especially for the elderly that walk to the PO they need a place to rest. I remember when they took them out. The ones on Northern are mostly destroyed and/or inhabited by people in need of serious help. St Marks church allows residents to use their garden/benches as well.

				We are talking about both...any place you can sit outside would be nice.&nbsp; If I take a long walk in the neighborhood, sometimes you feel you need to sit (and I am not yet Fifty).&nbsp; A bench or a cafe where you can order a drink both serve that purpose. Would be nice to have more options in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Homeless and drugs may have been a problem in the past...seems like every other neighborhood in Queens has more outdoor seating options.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				God only knows why, but there are plenty of benches to sit on, at the triangle where the BQE comes out onto Broadway. Not exactly scenic, or quiet, but they got put there as part of the renovation. Isn&#039;t that ridiculous? Business owners should not have to put their own benches out.

				In front of the entire PS 69, behind the tall fences/gates, you have a lot of land with grass that is not utilized.&nbsp; This would be ideal for lots of benches and in the evening it would be locked.&nbsp; Would the Board of Educations allow this?&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone from Councilman Dromm&#039;s office is reading this message could you please reply.&nbsp; The cost would be minimal.&nbsp; This area would be so much nicer than in front of the Post Office or the benches on 82nd Street.&nbsp;

				Do you think it&#039;s a byproduct of having too much private space - houses with gardens and buildings with garden spaces?<br /><br />I gotta say, it&#039;s a pet peeve of mine - sidewalk cafes. In some places it&#039;s great; side street, light traffic, trees. But the number of joints (especially in Manhattan) that have set up tables and chairs on a busy street with LOTS of pedestrians, LOTS of traffic (and its inherent honking and engine noise and exhaust fumes) are just legion. There are even a few that are set up on top of bus stops. How is that pleasant?<br /><br />But yer right, it WOULD be nice to be able to perambulate the neighborhood and stop in a nice little bistro for a bite and a glass. But that makes me a hipster trustafarian, I guess.... :-\

				According to Gothamist (http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/dot_to_install_1000_shiny_new_bench.php), the city is rolling out a new program that will install 1,000 new benches on city streets over the next several years. &nbsp; This is a great opportunity to get some of those broken benches on 82nd Street and Northern Blvd. replaced, and possibly add some new ones where they are needed. &nbsp; <br /><br />(http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/images/sidewalks/citybench_img7.jpg)<br /><br />The program is targeted at commercial districts, bus stops, and areas near senior centers, libraries and hospitals. &nbsp;Perhaps a bench in front of Regal Heights Rehab Center on 34th Avenue would be helpful? &nbsp;Or the Jackson Heights library?&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas for other locations? &nbsp;<br /><br />There&#039;s a form to fill out to submit an official request: http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/sidewalks/citybench.shtml
