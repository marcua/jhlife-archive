				Thank you, all.<br />Our goal is environmental sustainability, not just making JH look good, although there&#039;s nothing wrong with that.<br />Our curbside gardens create a hospitable environment for the trees they surround to grow and thrive. In turn, trees -- especially big mature trees -- significantly reduce street temperatures, and even that in our homes, through shade and transpiration (basically cooling by evaporation.) And that reduces the need for AC, meaning less energy consumption and less planet-warming carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere.<br />What&#039;s more these tree gardens, and the larger Post Office garden, are habitats for beneficial insects, hence our slogan, Bringing Mother Nature back to the city.<br />Many of you have participated in our efforts. Thank you. For those who haven&#039;t, we hope you will join us once, you just might enjoy it. If not you don&#039;t have to do it again, promise.
