			&nbsp;So much debate has happened with 34th Open Streets. Can anyone please answer why the ave is <br />closed when it is pitch black out at 7:00 on a cold night? With proper data collection, this could be<br />right sized so that the timing of the closures matches usage, need and common sense safety. How<br />many streets are closed at this hour besides 34th Ave which is not well lit and is mostly residential?

Must you inject your two cents of blind praise in every single discussion of &quot;Open&quot; Streets, regardless of whether it is relevant in any way at all? Itsit is totally right on this.

			&nbsp; Thanks ChickenringNYC. It&#039;s an ominous sign that our current electeds and those on the way out - and the way in - are avoiding a town hall style debate here. Any format will do but both the sides of always open vs. always closed vs some common sense usage needs to be properly debated if the neighborhood can withstand this change. The fact is that Open Streets are great for some, some of the time. And not really so great for others and they tend to be impacted more hours. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The army of people who want to make this &quot;their project&quot; and have their names attached is equally scary. But the immediate concern I have is the lack safety and visibility on these dark, cold and sometimes rainy nights is that 34th Ave is desolate and the lack of vehicular traffic makes it unsafe for residents living on the ave or nearby.
