				Hey all,<br /><br />I&#039;m Adam Warner from CUNY Graduate School of Journalism in Midtown. &nbsp;I started my first semester last month and will be at the school for another year and a half or so.<br /><br />For our Craft of Journalism class, each student had to choose a neighborhood to cover in one of the boroughs. &nbsp;I picked Jackson Heights and will be covering the neighborhood into 2012. &nbsp;I wasn&#039;t too familiar with the place going in, but have found it to be a fantastic corner of the city. &nbsp;I&#039;ve really enjoyed my experience so far.<br /><br />I was at the community board meeting last Thursday and picked up some helpful info, most notably the problem with overcrowded schools and the issue of little green space in the neighborhood. <br /><br />In any case, my next assignment is a crime story. &nbsp;I plan on visiting the precinct tomorrow, but thought I&#039;d ask around as well. &nbsp;So my question is: have there been any recent incidents or trends in the neighborhood that you feel need covered?<br /><br />Please feel free to PM me or respond with any ideas.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m open to any story suggestions, from social or political issues to profiles pieces or interesting events/places worth reporting on in the neighborhood.<br /><br />On a side note: &nbsp;I&#039;m also working on a piece about 75th Street being switched from northbound to southbound and the effects of that change on the community. &nbsp;If you know of any residents or businesses in the area that have been affected (positively, negatively, or not at all) by the move, let me know. &nbsp; <br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Adam

				Story idea:&nbsp; contrast &quot;NYPD Observation Tower&quot; with &quot;Falafel Cart Perv&quot; strings.&nbsp; Obviously some people on this message board think everything is peachy and quaint about Roosevelt Avenue/surrounding areas and the uptick in crime in the neighborhood&nbsp; while others (perhaps women?) not so much....&nbsp;

				Thanks, I live here too.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about making the mobile observation tower the focus of my story.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to use it as a focal point and then branch out into crimes/incidents that led to its being placed at 37th Ave./81st St.<br /><br />I was talking to one of the officers who works at the mobile center a week or so ago (not knowing at the time I might be doing a story on the structure), so I&#039;d like to start with him.&nbsp; One thing he mentioned was a problem with fights breaking out at bars, but I&#039;d have to talk with him again to confirm that those fights relate to the mobile tower. <br /><br />I also left a message with 115th Precinct&#039;s community affairs office, so hopefully I&#039;ll hear back from them soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />There aren&#039;t very many bars on 37th Avenue, are there?&nbsp; I think of them as being located primarily around Roosevelt Ave, but again, I&#039;m new to the neighborhood so I could be mistaken.&nbsp; <br />

				By all means investigate incidents and the reasons behind putting up the polcie tower.&nbsp; It is extremely important for people to be knowledgeable&nbsp; about and vigilant against crime in the neighborhood, including any uptick in crime. The incident at the falafel cart is obviously revolting and inexcusable. <br /><br />At the same time, it seems to me that some of the statements on the other thread about Roosevelt â€“ ie that it should be avoided at all costs, that it is not safe day or night â€“ were exaggerated and from my perspective as a long time resident, not really warranted based on current conditions on Roosevelt.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is important that discussions about crime be grounded in reality.&nbsp; I understand there are real problems along Roosevelt, particularly with quality of life issues. But it also seems like there are&nbsp; countless people who patronize bars, restaurants and businesses in that area every day and late into the evening, mostly without incident.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />For me a dangerous neighborhood is a neighborhood full of gunfire, roaming street gangs intimidating and terrorizing people, a high incidence of homicide, rape, arson and similar&nbsp; vicious crimes.&nbsp; Iâ€™m just not seeing that here, at least at the moment. <br />

				Yes, it&#039;s not that bad yet. Yes, you can walk on Roosevelt Avenue during the day most of the time:<br /><br />http://www.qchron.com/news/western/roosevelt-ave-shooting-prompts-call-for-action/article_348bba8b-5e3c-53d9-9b6d-38c74a6f0157.html<br /><br />Yes this was three years ago.&nbsp; But one year ago, a young man was beaten to death on 37th Avenue at about 7:30 at night.<br /><br />I wanted to make an impression on this women who was wandering around after midnight looking for open restaraunts to get food.&nbsp; She doesn&#039;t need to risk her safety.<br /><br />But I repeat:<br /><br />This summer, two women were sexually assaulted in JH. The first incident happened on Thursday at 3:10 p.m. The suspect allegedly grabbed an 18-year-old woman from behind, sexually abused her, and then ran away.<br /><br />Police say the suspect struck again the very next day at 8: 26 a.m. The suspect grabbed a 21-year-old woman from behind, sexually abused her, and then took off.<br /><br />Police released a photo earlier THIS WEEK of the suspect.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8393471&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-8393471<br /><br />This summer a groper was lose in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe he&#039;s been caught as yet.<br /><br />http://www.qchron.com/news/western/article_6b22e2fe-c471-11e0-b043-001cc4c002e0.html<br /><br />http://news.danieldromm.com/2011/08/pix11-queens-on-groper-alert.html<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to paint JH as the wild west.&nbsp; But I think we should take crime seriously.&nbsp; Crime increases during periods of great economic stress like the time we&#039;re experiencing now.&nbsp; Look - I live here too.&nbsp; I want JH to be a nice place for everyone who lives here.&nbsp; and safe too.&nbsp; &nbsp;Will that take an observation tower? I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; You think I&#039;m being alarmist.&nbsp; I hope that you&#039;re right and I&#039;m wrong, really I do.

The tower was up, the cart is only 1 block away.<br /><br /><br />And the answer from the police officer is also strange -- if the problem is bar fights, why have it on 37th Ave?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think people are complaining about the police being present in the neighborhood.

				If people don&#039;t want the observation tower they should let Police Community Affairs know.&nbsp; However, my point is that some people think Jackson Heights has no discernable crime problem and some people feel the opposite.&nbsp; I think that people have to be vigilant in Jackson Heights to keep this a livable community.&nbsp; But if you think an observation tower is unecessary in JH, by all means voice your opinion.&nbsp; I just want a police presence, whatever form it takes.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the police are trying to catch lewd falafel cart vendors (although they should); I think they are trying to keep an eye out for gang activity and other organized crime occurring in the neighborhood. I don&#039;t know why they chose to put it where they did.&nbsp; If you ask a police officer on the street, they will not tell you the whole story.&nbsp; If you want to know more about the hows and whys of they are doing something call&nbsp; 115 Precinct ommunity Affairs: (718) 533-2010 . Or call Dan Dromm&#039;s office and speak to his community liason. (718-803-6373)<br />&nbsp;<br />I have an email alert for news about JH, so I see on a daily basis what is being reported in the news.&nbsp; Some days it&#039;s a health fair at the local PS, or breast cancer screenings; other days it&#039;s that the police busted an illegal identity theft or prostitution ring. I am a resident and a home owner of Jackson Heights, I want to know what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; I want to be safe and happy in the community that I live in. I am not complaining to be negative or for the sake of complaining. I am just trying to keep my eyes and ears open.<br /><br />My suggestion to the student journalist is to look at the reasons WHY some people feel one way about crime (and perhaps the need&nbsp; or lack of need for observation towers)&nbsp; I think the press&nbsp; has called JH&nbsp; a &quot;diverse&quot; community; perhaps diversity stands for something besides ethnicity in this instance.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m a life long resident of Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m also of the mind that dangerous means gangs, gunfire, robberies, junkies. Jackson heights is at worst seedy. And this absolutley should be addressed, but generally speaking it&#039;s not a dangerous neighborhood. In fact, I&#039;m still somewhat shocked that it isn&#039;t a more dangerous neighborhood, considering the drug and prostitution trades that flourish here. Add to that the homosexual and transgender - transgender prostitution demographic, and you&#039;ll understand why it&#039;s more seedy (read: not very wholesome or safe, but not dangerous if you&#039;re just walking through).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Compare the statistics to Corona, you&#039;ll see what I mean. Also as a journalism major you really should google &quot;Manuel De dios Unanue&quot; as his life and death tie in to the neighborhood, and few people know about him.

				As we were walking by yesterday My child and I had a discussion about the tower. We were wondering if there is a crime happening how long would it take to descend to get the perp? We also notice there was a police officer (not in the tower) tucked in a doorway of a closed business texting on his phone. Makes me feel really safe.. :police: ???

				Thanks for the continued discussion everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been tied up with midterms the past couple of weeks, but will be attending the 115th Precinct&#039;s Community Council meeting this evening.<br /><br /><br /><em>mkn567</em> - I had never heard the story of Manuel De dios Unanue before, thanks for bringing it up.&nbsp; I&#039;d be interested in doing a commemorative piece marking the 20th anniversary of his death come March.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to believe he isn&#039;t mentioned more, considering the gravity of his death.&nbsp; Has crime decreased enough (over the last 20 odd years) that people aren&#039;t talking as much about the presence of cartels, etc.?<br /><br />I did a quick search and pulled up a couple of old Times articles that mention a heavy cartel presence in the 90s.&nbsp; It sounds like Jackson Heights was a much different place then:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/11/nyregion/jackson-heights-streets-familiar-to-drug-cartels.html<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/nyregion/window-immigrant-crime-jackson-heights-drugs-dirty-money-prostitution.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm<br /><br />Most information that I&#039;ve found seems to show a significant decrease in crime in Jackson Heights over the last 20 years,&nbsp; e.g.: http://www.dnainfo.com/crime-safety-report/queens/jackson-heights<br /><br /><br /><em>I live here too </em>- That&#039;s a great story recommendation.&nbsp; I have gotten a fairly wide range of opinions from locals on crime/safety in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Some people say that crime (specifically prostitution, drugs, and assault) is a glaring reality, while others seem to feel Jackson Heights is bordering on crime free.&nbsp; There&#039;s also the middle-of-the-road demographic that says it&#039;s all about being street smart. <br /><br /><br />BTW, do you guys recommend any local advocacy groups or community organizations that would be open to talking about crime in the neighborhood?&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping to discover a few tonight at the Community Council meeting. <br />

				Considering Jackson Heights is one of the hottest burgeoning neighborhoods in the five boroughs, I would suggest that if <strong>mkn567</strong> â€“ as a lifetime resident of the area â€“ feels this neighborhood is seedy, it&#039;s quite possibly due to his or her presence here.<br /><br />How very revealing to see this person toss LGBT people in the same pot as drug dealers and prostitutes.
