				Has any other Time Warner Customers been getting piss poor service lately? Primarily in the evenings? My issues started June 28th - and by now I have a call/notes log long enough to circle queens. I&#039;ve been making myself very vocal to get the issue resolve. I live on 81st and the issue just destroys Time Warner&#039;s fastest speed service.<br /><br />My ping times skyrocket into the 300-400 range and bandwidth drops significantly until around midnight, then speeds are normal. It starts going to shit around 8:30PM each evening. Even on weekends, when you&#039;d think &#039;peak hours&#039; would slow it down sooner than 8:30, I get full speed service (300Mpbs) until about 8:30, then BOOM down to between 8-12Mpbs and horrible latency.<br /><br />Trying to see if anyone else has been getting similar performance in the area. Thanks!

				I&#039;ve been having similar issues with 300/20 since February.&nbsp; I&#039;m near 81st as well.&nbsp; It gets fixed for a while, then it starts again within a month or two.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you tried twc.cotp@twcable.com?&nbsp; (Office of the President, Executive Customer Care Team.) They can usually get things unstuck but unfortunately, fixes don&#039;t last all that long.&nbsp; They have some serious issues with both their infrastructure and available bandwidth in the neighborhood and seem unwilling or unable to address it.<br /><br />The level 3 support people are good (direct number 866-506-0218), but once these issues are referred to their network group they end up in limbo with no response.<br /><br />I wish we could get FIOS, but there&#039;s no fiber passing most of our streets.&nbsp; When Verizon ripped up 37th Avenue near 81st I saw they were burying some fiber there, but when I asked they said it wasn&#039;t for FIOS, only phone service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last but not least, complain, complain, complain!&nbsp; &nbsp;The NY State Attorney General&#039;s office was interested in whether or not New Yorkers were actually getting the bandwidth we&#039;re paying for.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://ag.ny.gov/are-you-getting-internet-speeds-you-are-paying?wssl=1 (http://ag.ny.gov/are-you-getting-internet-speeds-you-are-paying?wssl=1)<br /><br />FCC Complaint Form:<br /><br />http://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824 (http://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824)<br />

				Thanks for the info Deja. I went ahead and filled the FCC complaint and submitted all the info/ screenshots I could for the NY State Attorney General&#039;s office. I may compose something to the Office of the President, Executive Customer Care Team as well.

				How do you check the speed? <br /><br />I don&#039;t use internet at home on weekdays, so what I get on weeknights is &quot;normal&quot; for me. However, I do notice that the speed slows down significantly after midnight. I keep getting &quot;Resolving host...Resolving host...&quot; messages at the bottom of the window. It&#039;s never occurred to me to complain to TWC because I didn&#039;t think it would do any good.

				It took years, but the Birchwood House on 73rd St just got FIOS a month or so ago. My service was just hooked up today (supposedly up to 100 Mbps). Speedtest says 71.88 Mbps download and 22.44 Mbps upload over Wifi right now.<br /><br />I had the same problems with Time Warner off and on where the internet would seem to be throttled at certain times. There was a particularly bad stretch that lasted for months, and then the service was fine for the last year. I assumed that they added capacity once Fios started installing on the block, but don&#039;t know for sure!<br /><br />Slowdowns in the evening are probably due to your neighbors eating up all the bandwidth by streaming Netflix and other TV.

				In addition to complaining to the NY AG and FCC, don&#039;t forget to send one to 311 as well: http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2834/cable-provider-complaint<br /><br />I previously made a cynical remark about them probably not doing anything but the last time I filed a complaint I got a call from someone in TWCs &quot;Regulatory Compliance&quot; division a couple of days later who sounded very irritated that I called the city on them.<br /><br />Also consider downgrading your service to what you&#039;re actually getting instead of paying for what you&#039;re not.

When I made my yearly call to TWC to renegotiate my new &quot;promotional package,&quot; the lowest rate I could get (for the cable channels I wanted and internet) was available in two different packages: one with the higher speed, and one with telephone. Since I&#039;m happy with my wireless service, I didn&#039;t want the phone option, so I took the package with the higher speed. They simply <em>did not offer</em> a lower-priced package without the higher speed or phone.&nbsp;

				Maybe there&#039;s something we can do as a group to light a fire under Verizon for FIOS.&nbsp; They&#039;re supposed to be taking orders even if it&#039;s not in your building and are supposed to provide it within a year.&nbsp; I wonder if hitting up any of our local elected hacks would do any good.

				I just returned my Time Warner equipment at Queens Center. They told me they increased capacity in western Jackson Heights 2 years ago, as I suspected.<br /><br />FYI, they offered a Triple Play package for $138 / month with a 6-show DVR if I was willing to stay (not willing, obviously). Might be useful info if you&#039;re trying to get something out of them.<br /><br />FIOS internet has been great for the first few days.

				Actually, Verizon has the absolute legal right, under State and Federal statutes, to enter into any multiple dwelling and install FIOS.&nbsp; There is literally nothing that an owner of a multiple dwelling can do to stop them.&nbsp; They will enter into an agreement with the owner regarding damages and liability for their installations, but that&#039;s it.&nbsp; I forget how many units a building has to have for this to apply.&nbsp; It may sound weird, but think of it this way - no owner of a multiple dwelling can prevent the phone company from coming in and installing phone service either, and since Internet has really replaced the phone in most instances, the State is just assuring that renters are not denied an essential service by their landlord.<br /><br />Verizon has sued owners for access, and has always won.
