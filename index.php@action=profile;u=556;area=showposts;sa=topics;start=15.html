					Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.&nbsp; Thank you. <br /><br />As part of their Community BrainFit Program, Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) is currently offering a free Depression Treatment Program.&nbsp; Stress and Depression can drain your energy, hope, and productivity, and affect your relationships with those you love.&nbsp; If you have mild depression that isn&#039;t improving, or you have moderate depression, CBT treatment may be very helpful to you. <br /><br />Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) recognizes that past events may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It helps you understand your thoughts and behavior and how they affect you.&nbsp; A screening is required, and if appropriate for CBT, you would then be eligible to receive 8-12 individual sessions at no fee. All QCPC programs are based on extensive research, and adopt a collaborative stance that encourages you to work on changing how you feel by putting into practice what you have learned.<br /><br />For more information regarding the QCPC Depression Program, please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or call 718-570-0500.

					Please share this with anyone who may benefit from this information.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dear Community Member:<br /><br />Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) is offering a Children&#039;s Anxiety Group for children ages 6 to 10, with unwanted fears, worries, and shyness. <strong>Facing Anxiety with Courage &amp; Empowerment (FACE)</strong> creatively incorporates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, psychoeducation &amp; practice. This program is based on extensive research, with the goal of helping children learn (in a supportive and encouraging environment) to cope more effectively with anxiety. The group activities will help provide children with tools to face stressful situations more courageously. <br />&nbsp;<br />The group is expected to start January 2016 and run on Thursdays from 4:30pm – 6:00pm for 16 sessions. Interested participants will be offered a brief phone screening followed by an in person interview to ensure that your child’s needs can be best met by this group. As a community service, most of the cost will be subsidized by the college, such that the fee for participation will be $95.00 (this includes the application, group screening, child group sessions, and parenting sessions). The fee may be further reduced in the case of financial need. <strong>No one will be turned away for inability to pay.</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />For more information regarding our children&#039;s anxiety group- Facing Anxiety with Courage &amp; Empowerment (FACE), Psychological Wellness Programs, or Psychotherapy Services, please email your contact information (phone number where you may be reached, best time to call you, and if it is okay to leave a message) to: <a href="mailto:QCPC@qc.cuny.edu" class="bbc_email">QCPC@qc.cuny.edu</a> or call 718-570-0500.

The clinic continues to offer treatment for problems such as depression, stress, anxiety, interpersonal/relational issues, dissatisfaction with current personal or interpersonal life choices, grief and bereavement, coping with medical illness or disability, trauma, self-esteem and body image concerns, parenting issues and adjustment to changing life circumstances. For children, typical problems may include separation anxiety, school refusal, social anxiety, fears, phobias, social skills deficits, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), tantrums, aggression, depression, moodiness, impulsivity, defiance and disobedience.&nbsp; The clinic team works closely with our child clients’ schools and does school visits when necessary. Fees for these services are based on a sliding scale from zero to fifty dollars (average fee is $10) that takes into account personal and/or family income and circumstances.
