					Maureen!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great to know you saw my comments and passed them on to dad.&nbsp; There have to be so many others who have delighted in reminding him of great times.&nbsp; Few people can say that they have that many friends and that have positively touched so many lives.&nbsp; OK, there was a lot of drinking too.&nbsp; Here&#039;s another recollection of mine.&nbsp; In 1977, I traveled to Ireland (alone) for the first time.&nbsp; When talking with Tommy, he suggested I might stop and say hello to his brother Eugene? berry in Dublin.&nbsp; He gave me the address of the bar where Eugene hangs out in the East Wall section.&nbsp; You might imagine how the Yank kid stood out walking in there.&nbsp; The bartender said, yes Eugene hangs out here and might be coming in yet that night.&nbsp; Eugene finally walked in, sat down with his pals at which point they all pointed at me.&nbsp; So I ended up having a few with Tommy&#039;s brother in East Wall.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure Tommy remembers my friend Jimmy Gallagher, who lived in Jackson Heights and ended up working for the N.Y. State racing (thoroughbreds).&nbsp; Just spent a weekend with him in Saratoga where he still spends every August.&nbsp; He&#039;s 60 years old, 3 grown kids and great wife, Nancy, whom you would have known also.&nbsp; The names of restaurants such as Casa Bella and La Fusta come up as well as the strip joint; Dunbarton Oaks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I seem to remember that the Liffey closed as &quot;Bridie&quot;? sold it?&nbsp; I&#039;ve always wondered how many years the Liffey was in operation and how long your dad had worked there.<br />It would be tempting to join FaceBook just for the conversations from former patrons.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A final note for Tommy regarding someone I had mentioned.&nbsp; The tall fellow (6&#039;9&quot;) that accompanied me in and sang from time to time was my best friend, Brian.&nbsp; At 35 he finally got married (she was 6&#039;).&nbsp; In 2000 she contracted liver cancer and passed in 4 months.&nbsp; For eight years Brian raised the two girls and a boy.&nbsp; The daughter grows to 6&#039;5&quot;, all time scorer leader at Boston College and plenty more records.&nbsp; The summer that she entered BC, Brian died suddenly of a aneurism.&nbsp; The daughter (eldest) is now playing in the WNBA for the Chicago Sky (injured, though) and the son has grown to 7&#039; tall (average athlete) in college.<br />Brian had a framed Liffey Certificate on his wall.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great to hear from you and Tommy, Maureen!&nbsp; <br /><br />Tom Agnes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					I&#039;ve only today happened on the exchange of comments 3 yrs ago re Tommy Berry on this forum.&nbsp; Very glad to hear from Tommy&#039;s daughter, Maureen, that he and Joe were fine.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that Maureen will see this and pass along to Tommy and/or Joe.&nbsp; They remember me.&nbsp; But, I had some of the best times ever there. <br /><br />I was 24 living in Connecticut and started driving down after the Liffey was written up as &quot;One of the 5 best neighborhood bars in NY&quot; and &quot;touted as having the best pint of Guinness this side of the Atlantic&quot;&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Pictures in article included Chris Keely smoking his pipe.<br />I would often bring my 6&#039;9&quot; friend and we would sing.&nbsp; When that friend moved to Minnesota and flew in for Christmas, i would pick him up at LaGuardia and we&#039;d head straight for the Liffey where he would call his home in Connecticut advising the parents who were in the middle of Mass at the house, that he was tied up at the airport for awhile.&nbsp; But, I trucked down all sorts of friends who all had a great time.<br />I still have two gift certificates for Liffey pints.&nbsp; In the hand-drawn cartoon is an elf peeking into the coffin box with the unusual contents (an enormous phallus) that the boys kept behind the bar.&nbsp; Tommy would bring it out whenever we sang Finnegan&#039;s Wake.<br />I have the article of the former Jackson Hts resident who had moved out to Washington, but after 7 yrs and a powerful craving for a Liffey pint, told his wife he was going to Tacoma and flew, instead, to LaGuardia and a weekend at the Liffey.&nbsp; I totally understood that kind of obsession.<br />Joe Taylor always wore a bow tie and presented the more formal atmosphere.&nbsp; Tommy presided over the night shift and had to be one of lads.<br />I&#039;ve blown off work when fed up with those idiots and headed down to the Liffey at 10 AM for some pints, a paper and conversation with Joe.<br />A men&#039;s room that belonged in Calcutta, but where the piper from the Emerald Society passed out standing up for 20 minutes until he came to, burst out blaring those pipes and on out to the street.&nbsp; The pool table.&nbsp; the vendors stopping in with stuff to sell that just fell off the back of a truck that day.&nbsp; Throughout, Tommy and Joe were the best!&nbsp; And at 2 AM I would drive all the way back to Connecticut.&nbsp; My friend Jimmy Gallagher, who the boys might remember, failed to pass along Tommy&#039;s message re the last night of the Liffey, so I never had the chance to say goodbye (and grab the box behind the bar).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So if anyone is in touch with Joe or Tommy (hopefully Maureen), please send my sincere thanks and very best wishes to them both.&nbsp; The Liffey was Lourdes, the holy water came in pints and the priests didn&#039;t need vestments.<br /><br />-Tom Agnes<br /><br />
