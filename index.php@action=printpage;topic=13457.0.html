				Last night while driving on Roosevelt Ave there was a NYPD checkpoint set up for cars driving westbound on Roosevelt at around 93rd. St. I waited in a long line of cars who were also being stopped, and when I finally got up to the cop who was stopping people I was asked for my license. I handed over my license and asked what I was being stopped for. He looked over my license and said that they were just stopping people to check licenses. After looking over my license he sent me on my way. I&#039;ve got a valid license, car is registered and insured, no reason to worry, etc., and I was pretty shaken up. I&#039;ve never encountered this before. How frequently does this happen here in JH? Is this something new? Why are they doing this? Anyone have any insight into this checkpoint practice? Is it even legal to be stopped while driving and asked for ID without cause (or, not to be told what the reason for the checkpoint is)?<br />

				The cops were probably stopping to check for drunk drivers, because it was a holiday weekend. If that was it, pretty standard and not exclusive to Jh.

				To check licenses.... and smell your breath for alcohol. It happens all over the country, especially on a holiday weekend. Keep safe.

				Also, the 115th writes about 300 tickets a month to unlicensed drivers, without these checkpoints. We have a bit of an issue with that as well as uninsured drivers. <br />I am glad they are checking, as these drivers are more prone to leave the scene of a collision - there really is a rise in hit and run drivers in the city in the last year, and anything that can prevent it, is useful. <br />Yes, 335 unlicensed and 110 uninsured in May. <br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/traffic_data/115sum.pdf

				Oh yes, white privilege in full effect here. To me it seemed as if they were targeting unlicensed Latino drivers. And also checking for drunk drivers, too. Never seen a check like this on 37th in the 80&#039;s.

				You know what - my husband is a person of color who&#039;s been stopped and frisked his whole adult life, and he would gladly sit in a checkpoint for this purpose because it is worth it. Jackson Heights has the highest number of drunk drivers in the entire city, and we have a depressingly high number of pedestrian injuries and fatalities.&nbsp; I am very good friends with a undocumented person from Ecuador, who delivers pizza. He was hit by a unlicensed drunk driver right here in JH, and was not able to work for several weeks and now suffers from disabling back pain.&nbsp; My husband and I tried to help him as much as we could, but he will never be the same.<br /><br />http://nypost.com/2010/06/14/nycs-drunkest/<br /><br />

				Actually the article is about Corona, but Roosevelt Avenue is a corridor that includes both neighborhoods.

				Nope: DUI checkpoints and the resultant request for licenses have been found to be legal<br /><br />http://traffic.findlaw.com/traffic-stops/are-dui-checkpoints-legal-.html<br /><br />but KNOW your rights at all checkpoints!<br /><br />http://www.flexyourrights.org/faqs/my-rights-at-checkpoints/

				i grew up in inner city cleveland and the checkpoints were used far far more often in non-white neighborhoods and inner ring suburbs than in the equivalent of rockland/fairfield/nicer westchester.....

				That would make sense as there is a higher density of traffic and the likelihood of preventing drunk/drugged drivers would be higher. Honestly, given the way people drive here, I think it acts as a good deterrent.

				I have seen people refuse to hand over license for checkpoints and go on there way..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know it doesn&#039;t seem legal to check for licenses...that&#039;s pretty intrusive (not talking about DUI)
