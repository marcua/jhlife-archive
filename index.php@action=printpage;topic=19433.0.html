				Just want to give a plug to the new Angel Indian Restaurant that opened at 7414 37th Rd. The owner was a chef at Adda in LIC, and the menu is all vegetarian. <br /><br />Was damn tasty, we had the saag paneer and the Masala Dosa; both of which tasted so fresh and you could taste the love. <br /><br />They are still shacking out the operation, but a awesome additional to the hood.

				I posted to support a new business in Jackson Heights, that was really tasty. Hopefully, we won&#039;t need to worry about Adda, because we can just stay in the neighborhood. <br /><br />It will be interesting if they applied for a beer/wine license or it will be BYOB. I forgot to ask when we were there over the weekend.

				Went tonight. It was good. The paneer is top notch. The rest was okay. I&#039;ll definitely go back to try something else.bc there is potential and the people there are nice. <br /><br />Def think every restaurant in this part of the nabe can use a serious aesthetic upgrade. Decor and ambience aren&#039;t even that expensive anymore!!!

				We ate there last night and echo everyone&#039;s positive comments here. Staff is great, food is much better than mostly all other options in and around 74th Street. If you&#039;ve been to Adda, then you know what you are in for apart from this place being pure vegetarian (a big plus in my book). Go now before the NYTimes does and the place gets packed up.

				We had a great time here tonight. The saag paneer was the best we&#039;ve ever had. Servers were friendly and offered us dahi batata puri as amuse-bouche: delicious! Also enjoyed the bhindi masala (okra) and rajma masala (red kidney beans). We plan on returning soon with friends. The chef-owner took time to chat with us. This is definitely a neighborhood gem worth supporting!

				Further adding to the praise, went for lunch today and thoroughly enjoyed everything we had--flavorful and tasty without being too spicy.&nbsp; Shout out for the Lotus Root Koftes and the Special Vegetarian Biriyani.&nbsp; After a recent meal at Adda--on many top 50 lists--I may have enjoyed our Jackson Heights Angel even more, the main difference is this is vegetarian, and Adda&#039;s menu is meat heavy.&nbsp; Nice additional to Jackson Heights, and superior quality to most of the South Asian places in the neighborhood.

				Yes! While we will still go to our usuals when we specifically want a meat dish, this has become our new favorite spot. That homemade pillowy paneer and generally high level of care with ingredients and preparation really set the food apart. We&#039;ve gotten it three times now when non-JH people come over and it shows off our neighborhood well!

				&nbsp;Based on the enthusiasm here, we got about five dishes yesterday from Angel. They were all outstanding and three had chicken, one cauliflower and one mixed veg. Naan too and this delicious green sauce. So tasty! We will move them to the top of the terrific options here in JH.

				Got the keema pav (lamb appetizer) tonight and I definitely recommend it. Really tender and well spiced. Also noticed a new Chef&#039;s Special item in addition to the dum biryani dishes -- chole batura. Oh my gosh the combination of the chickpeas and pickle and red onion is amazing. It&#039;s definitely going into the regular rotation of things we order from Angel.

				Nearly 20 Queens eateries have made the prestigious Michelin’s affordable restaurant list this year, including seven for the first time.<br />One of them is Angel Indian.&nbsp; (And it’s well deserved)<br /><br />The other JH restaurant that earned this is Phayul (Tibetan)

				&nbsp;These two restaurants are so deserving! It&#039;s fantastic for them. And for us with the thinking that this attention will bring them another group of customers to keep them in business through the pandemic and beyond. Love them both.

				i didn&#039;t mean that to be insulting and i didn&#039;t mean to disparage the dish (i find it pretty tasty sometimes).<br /><br />but it was actually invented in the U.K., and has been embraced there and here. the more Americanized Indian restaurants -- like the long-departed Mehfil and the recently departed Indian Taj -- served it. Angel, like its sister restaurant Adda, is more dedicated to making dishes that are full-on Indian.<br /><br />And i do hope you can find a nearby place to satisfy that craving -- i know the feeling from craving other dishes.<br /><br />here&#039;s a little story that lays out the origin story pretty well...<br />https://yorkshirebusinesswoman.co.uk/did-you-know-that-chicken-tikka-masala-doesnt-actually-exist-well-not-in-india-anyway/<br /><br />edit to add: i&#039;ve been to this place in Astoria and thought it was good (i only ordered veg dishes) and they seem to have it on their menu.<br />https://www.yelp.com/biz/tikka-indian-grill-astoria

				Thanks for the info.......and I did not take your comment as insulting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken to making the dish on my own, but haven&#039;t quite perfected the recipe to my liking.&nbsp; There was a place in the city that was great, but unfortunately, they are no longer there.&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;ll give the Astoria restaurant a try one of these days.&nbsp;

				I think the Murgh/Chicken Mahkni is similar.&nbsp; Angel has it on their menu and it is one of the dishes I like offered by Dera at 72nd and Broadway.&nbsp; You may want to try that dish if you crave Chicken Tikka Masala.
