			hello,<br /><br />I am looking for long time residents of Jackson Heights to interview for an art project, funded by the Queens Council on the Arts. I am creating a series of drawings which combine excerpts from interviews with architectural drawings of facades in the neighborhood.<br /><br />See this link for some examples: http://www.lindaganjian.net/upcoming<br /><br />I am looking for older residents of Jackson Heights to share their memories and impressions of the neighborhood. The excerpts are presented anonymously in the artwork. I record the interviews on my phone for my records, but I can also share a copy with you, and with your permission, I can also submit to the Queens oral history project through the library.<br /><br />Feel free to contact me if interested.<br /><br />-Linda<br />
