			<br />
			If you could ask your dog ONE QUESTION and get an answer (JUST ONCE), WHAT WOULD YOU ASK?<br /><br />I often wonder what&#039;s going on inside my dog&#039;s brain when he&#039;s staring at me so I&#039;m curious to hear what others say.

			What is bothering you?&nbsp; Sometimes you know a dog is feeling sick or down and you don&#039;t know why.

			Mine&#039;s kinda stupid but I&#039;d want to ask: What do you do when I&#039;m not home?

			Give it to me straight: Is it really so awful when I leave and wonderful when I return, or are you hamming it up for a treat?

			I can&#039;t even think if one good question I&#039;d like to ask.&nbsp; I have too many.<br /><br />You know, I used to have another dog a few years back, and when she was a puppy we would leave her in a closed off area of our apartment.&nbsp; We&#039;d set up all these safety gates so as to prevent her from possibly getting into trouble in other areas of the apartment.&nbsp; Hubby and I would go out to dinner or a movie and come back home to find our place a mess.&nbsp; The uncertainty of what the dog had gotten into would worry me.&nbsp; She was a small puppy, so we couldn&#039;t figure out how she was escaping the closed off area.&nbsp; One day we decided to videotape her while we were out.&nbsp; We set up the camera and left.&nbsp; Of course when we returned home we encountered another mess, so we ran to the TV to watch the tape.&nbsp; The little brat was climbing the gate, and having difficulty at that.&nbsp; She was tiny but somehow managed to scale the big gate.&nbsp; So much for the idea of the gate.&nbsp; We scratched that and just had to call on dog sitters from then on.<br /><br />New dog....new ideas.&nbsp; The second time around, we used a crate to keep our dog safe when we were not home.&nbsp; It worked like a charm, and gave us peace of mind.
