And I think people do tend to stay at Google for longer than just 1 or 2 years, unlike Amazon, so they might be interested in buying rather than just renting.

Think restaurants, bakeries, hairdressers, cinemas, of course dog daycare centers, etc. They didn&#039;t just hoard their money. <br /><br />And salaries generally did go up in Seattle (and the minimum wage went up, notably). Partly because the Amazon workers could afford to pay higher prices for things, so other employers could afford to raise salaries. And also partly because other employers had to increase their salaries in order to compete with Amazon for employees. Amazon hires a really broad range of people, not just engineers.<br /><br />Probably one of the worst things that happened in Seattle is that the prices of anything that was very limited in supply went up sharply (e.g. rent and housing prices), which did hurt a lot of people in the community, unless they already owned property themselves. It probably could have been much worse, Seattle was actually pretty good at knocking down old warehouses and buildings and constructing new apartments, which helped to prevent severe price escalation like in San Francisco and the Bay Area (where no new housing seems to ever be constructed). But the house prices still escalated pretty rapidly in Seattle.<br /><br />BTW, for anyone curious about Amazon work culture, this site is pretty interesting: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thefaceofamazon/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/thefaceofamazon/</a>. It has stories about office jobs and also about warehouse jobs.

Queens alone has over 2.5 million I think. <br /><br />New York is a giant place over 10x Seattle&#039;s size.<br /><br />These folks will simply blend into the diverse mix here...and add to it.&nbsp; That&#039;s the beauty and dynamism of New York.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I basically agree, but FYI, the &quot;official&quot; Seattle is just a tiny area (a bit like the &quot;official&quot; San Francisco). The area around it that most people would think of as still being Seattle (and where you could easily commute to Amazon) is several million people, depending on where you draw the borders.<br /><br />For example Seattle + Bellevue + Kirkland + Redmond has a similar area to Queens and has over 1 million people. <br /><br />I think Amazon might not have a huge impact on NYC overall, but it will definitely have a big impact on the neighborhoods near Long Island City. If other tech companies start moving to NYC (or growing here), e.g. to hire all the dissatisfied Amazon employees who have already moved here, then that could have a big impact on NYC. <br /><br />For example, there was an article a few days ago that Google is going to double their headcount in NYC (to 20,000+), and Facebook also has a large office here which will probably grow. Nobody really wants to live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore when they could live in a more interesting city like NYC and still have a great job, especially when it&#039;s often cheaper to live in NYC as well.

By far, the most lively place near Amazon was a Whole Foods, which closed at 9pm and is now part of Amazon anyway.<br /><br />If Long Island City is really chosen for the HQ, then I would expect a lot of people to live in Astoria, Greenpoint, Sunnyside/Sunnyside Gardens, etc, instead of actually living in Long Island City where everything seems kind of ugly and bland. Maybe Jackson Heights near the Roosevelt/74th station as well, though it is much too far to walk, but the subway access is pretty great. Or maybe the area near Forest Hills station if they have kids and want the best schools, but most Amazonians had dogs instead of kids, so expect to see a lot of fancy dog daycares and salons pop up in Queens <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Here&#039;s an example of how many buildings Amazon now occupies in Seattle, although even that map is out of date: <a href="http://www.amazonhqtours.com/take-an-audio-tour/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.amazonhqtours.com/take-an-audio-tour/</a>. That whole area marked with yellow buildings was dead outside of work hours, and not somewhere most people wanted to live, especially because they often didn&#039;t hold positive feelings towards Amazon and didn&#039;t plan to stay working at Amazon for longer than 1 or 2 years.
