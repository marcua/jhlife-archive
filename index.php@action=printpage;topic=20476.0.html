				We all know about https://www.turbovax.info/, right? It continuously scans all city and state (and I think now pharmacy) sites to show all currently open appointments everywhere on one page. It often mentions which vaccine is given at the site too. If you keep an eye on it, you&#039;ll eventually catch when there&#039;s a massive opening of appointments. You can then just click to link to the city or state website to make your appointment. It saves you the trouble of having to check multiple sites.

I&#039;ve been volunteering with Vaccine Angels and it helped me get lots of people appointments. The news appears to be we&#039;re crossing over from a time of vaccine scarcity to one of trying to locate more people who want a shot.

The nearest big site to us that carries it is The Javits: https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/<br /><br />For other sites, the Vaccine Finder is helpful because it tells you which site has which vax:<br /><br />https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/<br /><br />The drug stores are a mixed bag. Rite Aid/Duane Reade has Pfizer. CVS has J+J. <br /><br />CVS&#039;s system is a bit wonky. It works best on Phone. It will tell you that all of NY state is booked up, but you can trick it into revealing new openings. The first time you&#039;re asked to choose a state, choose a state other than New York that you think will have more vax than people who want it. Choose a date. Now edit the date and when you do that change the location. This time search for an area not a zip code, such as Queens, NY. <br /><br />Many of the drugstores keep a paper waiting list. I&#039;ve heard from more than a handful of people who say they walked into a drugstore at the end of the day and got one. <br /><br />For links to all the &quot;finders,&quot; this is a pretty good summary:<br /><br />https://states.aarp.org/new-york/covid-19-vaccine-distribution

				It still seems a challenge to get a vaccine appointment and the general recommendation is to get whichever you can get soonest (J&amp;J, Phizer, or Moderna). If a medical professional told you specifically to only get J&amp;J because of health conditions you have, then that&#039;s a different story of course. I&#039;m not even sure if this is something that doctors specify to their patients. I know some people with certain conditions are advised against getting a vaccine.<br /><br />Most people shouldn&#039;t overthink it, just get the soonest appointment for any COVID vaccine.
