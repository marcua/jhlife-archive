				Being the person that I am, I have to point out a few things.<br /><br />Firstly, this seems a bit suspicious to me<br /><br />and.. Jackson Heights is spelled wrong<br /><br />My major issue is that this party begins at 9PM in a residential building, I don&#039;t know what kind of party this is supposed to be, but do you really think the neighbors would appreciate all the noise that will be generated.<br /><br />Just my opinion.

				It seems to me that instead of ignoring an invitation that clearly wasn&#039;t of interest, several people on this board decided to respond with sarcasm, rhetorical questions, and outright hostility.&nbsp; Nice welcome mat.&nbsp; If it were me, I wouldn&#039;t have responded either.<br /><br />Would it kill us perhaps to could show a bit more civility to newcomers to the neighborhood?

				I will ask directly:<br /><br /><strong>MarkDu</strong>, Did you happen to notify your neighbors that you were inviting an entire messageboard of random strangers into your building? <br /><br />(It would be different if one had to log in to view all the posts here, but that isn&#039;t the case, so anybody from anywhere can come to this board and read all the posts without creating an account.)<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />For me, that is the main issue stemming from the OP, however much the Moderating team and OP seem to want to gloss over it to say that people are being &quot;unwelcoming&quot; by responding to a really strange first post.&nbsp; Is there a new rule now we aren&#039;t allowed to voice concerns?&nbsp; <br /><br />I have <em>nothing </em> against MarkDu by the way.&nbsp; I read in another thread that he plans on taking on the leadership torch of the JH Food Group.&nbsp; That takes a lot of balls and I wish him great success.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s not difficult to understand why the original post was strange to more than one person.&nbsp; Your last argument pretty much states &#039;only people that live in the building are allowed to have an opinion, who the hell are you to say anything&#039; and is pretty baseless since markdu himself opened the invitation to his neighbors meaning <em>&#039;people that read this board&#039;</em>.&nbsp; Markdu has even said he&#039;ll be posting <em>more </em> open invites in the near future, so it would seem he wasn&#039;t &quot;scared off by the meanies!&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t see why you are trying to quiet people that brought up valid concerns.&nbsp; It seems you are more interested than arguing around the point than actually discussing it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				I acknowledge everyone&#039;s concerns here and it was never my intention to create a discussion about the potential nuisance one might create by having a party within a building, among other issues. It&#039;s also fine with me that people might express disinterest or suspicion to the posted event, and that is fine as well- this is a message board where anyone can express anything they want. <br /><br />By making an generally open invitation on this message board, I necessarily assumed everyone who actively participates in this message board would be of suitable age, maturity or discretion for open invitations to my place and I think it was a reasonable assumption given that based on the posted messages, people here seemed civically and socially engage with the community at large. So if it seemed suspicious that I gave an open invitation, that was the reason why I did so on this particular forum. Otherwise, I was ever mindful of the New York City building codes, the carrying capacities of my apartment and buildings among other potential liabilities, so I would be ready to prevent any overflow that might create a nuisance within the building. <br /><br />Anyway, this thread was all really informative as I learned quite a bit. Feel free to keep this going.

				do you guys really think that an open invitation on this site would yield 100 crazy, drunk partygoers coming in and out of the building? the reality is that an open invite and nothing else would only give 2 or 3 people.
