				I had some problems inserting the hyperlink, sorry about that. The article came out in today&#039;s Daily News, though, and it&#039;s definitely something that we all need to be aware of.

				Wow, that story was worse than I expected.&nbsp; It was 11:30 in the morning and they grabbed her off a bike.&nbsp; I had assumed I was going to read that she knew her kidnappers.<br /><br />Thanks very much for posting the link.&nbsp;

				East Elmhurst, technically. But yeah, so scary. DNAinfo.com has a few more details:<br /><br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130725/east-elmhurst/woman-knocked-off-her-bike-by-minivan-kidnapped-queens-cops-say

				That is scary.&nbsp; I have walked around that area of East Elmhurst during the day before and it feels like a very safe, pleasant residential area with single family and 2-3 family homes with driveways and yards. It sounds like a big risk for 5 men to take to get what is probably only going to be a few dollars in someone&#039;s wallet.&nbsp; I hope the victim is ok.

				Thanks for posting! I was around when the ambulance was there. I live nearby. Terrible, hopefully this won&#039;t happen again and as neighbors we&#039;re proactive about eliminating these losers.

				From what I heard about this on NY1 yesterday, it sounds like she was targeted by these guys. She owns her own cab company and apparently they were saying things like &quot;Where&#039;s the money!!?!&quot;. It sounds highly targeted, not random. But at 11:30AM? That&#039;s brazen. Hope they catch them.
