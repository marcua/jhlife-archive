					This is neat ... I really should come here more.<br /><br />Question:&nbsp; Do the photos have to be just buildings, or can they be people and events in the neighborhood?&nbsp; (For example, I have great shots of my son and his classmates at the Halloween parade.)<br /><br />If this is a silly question for the group, as soon as I figure out this personal message stuff, maybe someone can tell me on the QT.&nbsp; Thanks!

					I always forget I joined this board &#039;til someone links it from the yahoo group.&nbsp; LOL!<br /><br />Anyway, I lived in the Greystones for about 9 years and loved it (we only moved because we wanted more space), though I admit I was spoiled to the walk-up situation because we were on the first floor, direct from the staircase.<br /><br />One small thing though is that the gardens behind the Greystones, at least on our side that was between 79th and 80th, aren&#039;t like Dunnolly or Hawthorne (other places I&#039;ve owned co-ops in) in that not very many people use them, the grass is more like a field.&nbsp; Not being of the green thumb variety, didn&#039;t bother me much, but for the true garden enthusiasts, these aren&#039;t your central &quot;courts&quot; like many of the other co-op communities.&nbsp; (Unless they&#039;ve changed since 2003?)<br /><br />No idea why it&#039;s divided over two blocks though (in fact it always struck me odd, because its like the gardens extend into what would be the property of the other co-ops on 79th and 81st).

					Just to add to the &quot;?&quot; originally listed at Dunnolly Gardens, it is a co-op, but all 6 buildings are one co-op.&nbsp; (This was new for me .. I grew up for most of my childhood in Hawthorne and spent a decade in a Greystone ... both are, as said here, where each building is its own co-op.)<br /><br />

					It was already mentioned that Lucy Liu grew up here.&nbsp; Just to add, she attended both PS 69 and IS 145 (we were in the same classes).&nbsp; I remember when Ally McBeal was on and she joined the cast I was like &quot;I know her ...&quot; then when I saw the name I was like &quot;ahhhh.&quot;<br /><br />Another notable local (notability arguable I guess to some) is Gene Simmons of KISS fame.

					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your survey is the first I&#039;m answering on this board.&nbsp; (I was actually referred by a friend from the yahoo group, only to find out that I must have joined months ago and never recalled ... that&#039;s a sign of old age!&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />&nbsp; )<br /><br />First name (optional)?&nbsp; Rob<br /><br />Male or Female?&nbsp; Male<br /><br />Age (optional)?&nbsp; 38<br /><br />What is your ethnic background?&nbsp; Italian-Greek-Polish<br /><br />How long have you lived in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; 38 years (5 apartments all within 6 blocks of each other ... I&#039;m not really a nomad.)<br /><br />Do you work in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; No, I work in Floral Park.&nbsp; I teach special education.<br /><br />Do you drive or use public transportation?&nbsp; Public transportation, though I&#039;m a very good passenger when others drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Do you own or rent accommodation?&nbsp; Own, always have.<br /><br />What major changes do you think have taken place in Jackson Heights (in terms of economic development, density, housing, ethnicity, transportation, etc.)?<br /><br />Wow, that&#039;s a longer answer.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously the neighborhood has gone through major changes a few times in my 38 years. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as crime, I remember the street gang 70s, the wild drug 80s, the cleaner and leaner 90s, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s partially the change in the neighborhood (I recall when we first got the 115th precinct), and partially the overlying betters sense of community here.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Housing prices, after a dip in the early 90s, have skyrocketted.&nbsp; (I bought a co-op in 1993, sold it for over 200% what I paid in 2002, bought a larger co-op with those profits, and now that property is worth over twice that value.&nbsp; If I were starting out today, I&#039;d be priced out of my own neighborhood.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Economic development is different ... better and worse.&nbsp; Rather than give any one opinion, I would point out that franchises were not here when we were growing up (we had to hike to Astoria Blvd or the mall for McDonalds!), but the smaller stores were always special as well (for example, we bought our (yes, its true) RECORDS from Numbers, not the mall).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ethnicity was always diverse ... Jackson Heights was unique in that aspect.&nbsp; I recall when I went to high school at Bronx Science, there were kids from all over the city.&nbsp; There were neighborhoods that were known as predominately Italian, or Colombian, or Irish.&nbsp; Jackson Heights had no &quot;classification&quot; ... it was always diverse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Transportation was always great ... 20 minutes from Manhattan.&nbsp; It&#039;s only been improved by better service overall (although the once-19B-now-49 needs more buses!!) and more train lines.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the density is best summed up in the education.&nbsp; When I went to PS 69, kids from all over the neighborhood went there.&nbsp; We then went to IS 145 (except for the few who tried the then brand new IS 227 magnet school).&nbsp; It was a little crowded but we all fit.&nbsp; Now there are so many more kids, there are 4 extra schools ... 69 itself only takes kids from 72nd Street to 79th or 80th.&nbsp; So the population density has increased, as is reflected by that fact.<br /><br />What problems in Jackson Heights cause you concern?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The neighborhood is great, but of course it could be even better.&nbsp; Security can sometimes be an issue (I&#039;d had family assaulted outside the school while dropping children off), especially at night.&nbsp; The over pricing of the real estate tends to attract a certain &quot;trendy&quot; element that then express dissatisfaction over the way the neighborhood is.&nbsp; Some object to the noise ... me I thrive in it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, Jackson Heights is the reason so many of us are overweight!&nbsp; All this great food to eat out or order in ... why stir up the Campbells when I can get aloo gobi or pad khing or a Colombian steak?&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Yes I can blame the neighborhood for the extra pounds I packed since college.<br /><br />Glad I found your survey!&nbsp; Its a great way to introduce myself to a board that I apparently found late night months ago (ah insomnia!).<br />
