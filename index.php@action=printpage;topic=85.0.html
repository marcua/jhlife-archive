				Are there any low key bars in JH? I recently noticed the Ready Penny Inn and wanted to check it out, but it seems that there are very few irish style pubs in JH. I also went to Legends for the BBQ and we got a beer there as well. So far the best deal seemed to be the bowling alley- bottles of Miller were only $2.50! I&#039;ve been to some of the pubs in Woodside (Donovan&#039;s-tried the burger- and Saints and Sinners), but would like to find a local.<br /><br />Any bar reviews would be appreciated. :)

				I&#039;m sure that someone would have mentioned it, but since I&#039;m here and don&#039;t feel like cleaning my apt, I&#039;ll do it myself. :-)<br /><br />There&#039;s Cassidy&#039;s Ale House on 75th and 31st.&nbsp; &nbsp;The place has been there for a long time.&nbsp; Started off (as far as I know) as Stable Mates, then went to Big Boys in the 90s and has been Cassidy&#039;s for...6 or 7 years?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Not sure it would fit into the category of &quot;low key&quot; or not, but if you go there after 3:00ish, you&#039;re sure to catch a few of the teachers from McClancy decompressing from their day.&nbsp; &nbsp;The food is on the better-than-decent side but the wings were on the tiny side the last time I ordered them there.<br /><br />They have the usual beer selection with 8 or 10 taps, but being a bit of a beer snob, I can&#039;t get excited over Miller, no matter how cheap it is.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				I am also a beer snob, and am sad that so many of the places close to me have really uninspired choices in bottles, and nada in draft.&nbsp; I like the Ready Penny and Legends ok, but both are a long enough trek that I rarely go.&nbsp; I wish so much that the old North Fork bank on 37th and 80-something would become a sun-filled place for burgers, salads, and wonderful microbrews on draft.....sigh.....<br /><br />(Attention any aspiring restauranteurs: I promise I will spend all of my money there)

				I do love Sunswick, and the burger I had there was pretty good, too.&nbsp; As a mom of a 2yo, though, I need some good draft beer closer to home!&nbsp; One thing I like about Cup is that it is a place that provides crayons for my toddler while I imbibe in a Magic Hat or Dogfish Head.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a bit of a hike. :(

				meh. Not really. DH and I just went out last night and were too tired to make it to Woodside. We had two choices for pints: Legends or ReadyPenny. We chose RP and while they pour an ok pint of Guinness (other than that, just Killians, Bud, and something just like Bud) the atmosphere is just depressing.&nbsp; Legends isn&#039;t much better. I wish someone would open up a place with good drafts and some atmosphere, and if there were bistro food, too, I would blow a lot of money there, I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; Woodside is fine, but the whole allure of a good neighborhood bar is that it is close by (and has draft, obviously!).<br /><br />I often walk by the defunct NorthFork bank and think of what a great, light-filled space it would be for good pints and pub grub.

				My BF and I constantly discuss the lack of bars in JH.&nbsp; We like Legends for a quick meal and a cold one, but not for a hangout...Cassidy&#039;s is just scary.<br /><br />Lately, we&#039;ve been TRYING to like the Ready Penny...They&#039;ve been having this recurring karaoke night, which is fun and hilarious at the same time.&nbsp; They&#039;re trying, but it&#039;s still not up to snuff.&nbsp; Helen&#039;s a doll!&nbsp; <br /><br />We stopped up to Novo once for a drink after dinner, and we just didn&#039;t feel comfortable there - plus they charge Manhattan prices.<br /><br />Unfortunatetly, our hangouts are still in Astoria, but would LOVE to have a true local.&nbsp; anyone, anyone?

				oh goodness - I&#039;d written off Terraza on Gleane a while back, simply because the best they had was Heineken in a bottle. <br /><br />BUT, on my run this morning, I took a slight detour to peer into the window and saw.....A BROOKLYN LAGER <span class="bbc_u"><strong>TAP!!!!</strong></span><br /><br />There was a second beer on tap, but for the life of me, I can&#039;t remember what the heck it was.

				A lot of the bars/pubs in Jackson Heights strike me as being hangouts for alcoholics (who need to hang out in some 12 step meetings) as opposed to&nbsp; social drinkers just&nbsp; hanging out enjoying a beer or two. I have never been to Legends or ReadyPenny Inn, but, have heard they&#039;re&nbsp; pretty decent. Novo doesn&#039;t seem to me to have that bar vibe, more like an upscale restaurant/bar ( i agree about the Manhattan prices). I like Jardi, has a nice continental flavor and good Sangria, and love the appetizers.&nbsp; Not sure if they have beer on tap though (not a beer drinker). <br />

				I don&#039;t drink beer.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I do give a huge thumb&#039;s up to Legends for the BBQ that&#039;s served up in the back of the bar.&nbsp; The beef short ribs are smokey, tender and delicious.&nbsp; The bar area seems low key, mostly frequented by folks watching sports or talking about the same.&nbsp;

				So to follow up on my own post: we ended up watching the fight at Dolphins Sports Bar on Northern Boulevard.

				Raizer Blue is a Spanish bar (Spain).&nbsp; Most of the customers are Spanish but you do find English speaking customers.&nbsp; It has a nice clientele and pretty barmaids.&nbsp; It has a great jukebox with a good selection in both English and Spanish.&nbsp; The music is usually very loud so if that would bother you you might not like it.&nbsp; It gets very crowded after 10PM on Fridays and Saturdays.&nbsp; <br /><br />Donovan&#039;s is a great Irish Pub with an older crowd than many Irish Pubs.&nbsp; Mostly 30&#039;s and up.&nbsp; It is on the corner of Roosevelt Avenue and 58th Street.&nbsp; It also has food at very reasonable prices but they don&#039;t accept credit cards.

				I really like Jardi on Northern and 84th or so?<br />I love the atmosphere, the tapas are delicious and affordable - and they have a decent wine selection. I&#039;m hoping they canned the really bad latin singer who starts at 10:00. After he starts singing, conversation is useless, although it is good for a laugh.

				We checked out The Ready Penny and Terrazo last week on a Wednesday night. The RP wasn&#039;t too welcoming, so we high tailed it for Terrazo. There was an event going on upstairs, but they let us stay and drink downstairs. They had Brklyn Lager &amp; GUINNESS on TAP!!! AWESOME! Both were great. It&#039;s the first bar I&#039;ve been to in JH that I really thought was cool and relaxing. They are doing quite a bit of work on the place, and I&#039;m looking forward to going back to see the progress. If a place like Terrazo can make it in JH (I guess technically it&#039;s Elmhurst, but whatev) it seems more places like that can totally open up.

				We went to Terraza early, but there was no one there, they didn&#039;t have coffee or milk (even though they have a nice coffeemaker).&nbsp; All the seats were uncomfortable and they were moving things in and out.&nbsp; The music was waaaaaaaay too loud.&nbsp; Again, it could be because it was early, but it was like they were doing us a favor by letting us stay there.&nbsp; Why open if you are going to be doing construction?<br /><br />I&#039;ll try it again some night, but it reminded me of college student coffee shop.

				I wandered into Terrazzo Cafe last Wednesday night.&nbsp; It is definitely a different type of place that we have had in the Heights before.&nbsp; Clearly a Latin/American crossover feel.&nbsp; The Beers are $4.00 for any bottle and $6.00 for a Guinness or Brooklyn Lager on tap.&nbsp; Being a member of the 40+ group I was older than almost everyone there&nbsp; although I did talk to some friendly people.&nbsp; I would come again but not by myself as many people there seemed to know each other.&nbsp; All in all I think it is a nice addition to the neighborhood especially for the younger artsy crowd.

				Sorry Buddy,<br /><br />If I did open something, it&#039;d be a dive.&nbsp; Beer and a shot joint, dusty and dimly lit.&nbsp; Jukebox, pool table and maybe 2 TV&#039;s tops, decked out like the bar in the basement of your granddad&#039;s with old Miller High Life schwag for decor.&nbsp; Taps would probably be domestic fare with one Guinness and one Seasonal, but we&#039;d keep Heineken, Sam, Corona, Amstel and a few others in bottles for variety.<br /><br />And call me a traditionalist, but a bar doesn&#039;t serve food.&nbsp; A restaurant serves food, which can contain a bar, although Legends is the one exception, the only bar I&#039;ve ever been to that contains a restaurant, but if I opened a bar... well pretzels and beer nuts is about the best I&#039;d do.<br /><br />I never made it to the Starting Gate when I was in Woodside, but remember hearing a few good things about it in passing.<br /><br /><br />

				<strong>Eddiestjohn,<br /><br />Good question, Just pull up to the open lot and find a spot or go to the covered parking below.&nbsp; They won&#039;t stop you and if for any reason there is a security outside and they ask if you are staying (99% chance this wont happen) you simply say you are going to pine or better yet say you are going to see Chuck.&nbsp; Everyone eats there, employees as well so they wont care.&nbsp; I often find myself hanging out in the lobby waiting for a friend and I have never ever been asked anything.&nbsp; I often go by chance and rarely plan on going but may find myself there 3 or 4 times monthly.&nbsp; Gigantic Parmesan sandwiches and other fare at the bar as well but take advantage of the small buffet&nbsp; if you aren&#039;t at the dining room.</strong>

				I am probably much closer to Cassidy&#039;s than most of you but in my opinion, it is worth the walk for beer and for the food. I&#039;ve always found it to be friendly and welcoming. In fact, when I moved here in October after a long and yucky day unloading the moving truck by myself, I went there and was instantly welcomed. When I said I was new to the neighborhood, the bartender introduced me to everyone and everyone was very friendly. Having lived in a lot of different places, it was most of the nicest welcomes I have gotten to a new neighborhood. People gave me advice about different.<br />I now go there frequently with my husband and (sometimes) our 11-year-old. When we do bring our daughter, they are always really nice to her and remember that she likes Shirley Temples :) The food is really good, the special burger is fantastic and they do their own steak fries. During football season, they had a wings (25 cents) and Coors Light special ($7/pitcher).<br />And their draft beer selection is better than most in the neighborhood. They just added Franziskaner Hefeweizen which is delightful and much cheaper than most other places.

				wow, thanks for the tips, Tara!<br />I gotta tell you, last football season, I had some trying weeks, and not many of my friends are fans of watching football... All I wanted to do was watch football and eat chicken wings and drink beer. That&#039;s all I wanted. It was hard finding this in my neighborhood. I still am not all about Legends - I pretty much just wanted 25 cent wings.... I will def check out cassidy&#039;s by years end.

				Well, Cassidy&#039;s definitely has excellent wings. Their medium ones are a little spicy and a little sweet. The hot ones are your traditional hot buffalo wings and the really hot ones are wonderfully hot but still flavorful...I only ate one but my husband loves them. And you can&#039;t beat 25 cent wings and $7 pitchers of beer. If you are there on Mondays during football season, look for us. My 11-year-old will be the silly one cheering for the Detroit Lions if they are playing...Yikes!<br />

The kitchen is definitely open pretty late on Friday and Saturday but I am not sure when exactly it closes on any other night. I know I&#039;ve been able to get food before 11 though.

				Wow!&nbsp; It&#039;s been a while since the last post to this thread, so I&#039;m sure Jackson Heights and neighboring communities have seen a few changes in terms of bars, pubs, etc.&nbsp; Here&#039;s one change...&nbsp; Donovan&#039;s Pub in Woodside is under new ownership and will be getting somewhat of a facelift.&nbsp; According to the Queens Chronicle, the new owners are Woodsiders.<br /><br />While the new ownership claims to want to maintain the pub&#039;s original vibe, they are planning some changes.&nbsp; This may be of interest to those looking for a sports bar feel:<br /><br /><strong>&quot;The taps will get a little updating as well with a few more microbrew selections. The new owners want to also tap into the Mets and Giants fan customer base by subscribing to additional TV sports packages.&quot;</strong><br /><br />Best burger joint, Donovanâ€™s Pub, in Woodside bought by neighbors (http://www.qchron.com/editions/western/best-burger-joint-donovan-s-pub-in-woodside-bought-by/article_35a865f7-3ea5-5ef2-85b7-fefac008497b.html)

				There is also a small Thai bar on Woodside Ave. around 76 street or 77 street. It&#039;s between the Tea Cafe and the Thai grocery store. It&#039;s small but has high ceilings and is a nice little space. They also have Thai bar snacks for sale as well as drinks, and get a mostly young asian crowd, but the one time I was there, there was a nice mix of people.

				<br />Amaru is extremely calm and has a nice atmosphere early in the evening.<br />After living on Northern for 7 years now, I am almost 100% sure that that the reason why it turns in to a club during the late hours/ wknds, is that they would not be able to survive without that income. Northern sadly, does not like anything too unique :(<br />If rents were lower. on 37ave, I personally think that is where a smaller, more charming bar may be successful. When Arunee Thai opens on 37 th, I read they will have a bar.<br /><br />In regards to bars, for now, I think we all still need to take a short trip to Astoria for the type of establishments we are looking for; something charming, quiet, a little atmosphere....

I&#039;ll keep my fingers crossed we&#039;ll get one soon. I&#039;ve heard there&#039;s also a lot of good pubs in sunnyside.
