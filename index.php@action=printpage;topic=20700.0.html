				I have noticed that there are couple of folks who regularly smoke marijuana on the 34th ave open street at around 3 pm. It&#039;s usually around the IS 230. Is it legal to smoke marijuana in public? If not, how can we make it stop? I hate it when I walk past them with my daughter coming back from school.

				It is now legal. You can smoke a fat blunt anywhere you can smoke cigarettes, pipes, or cigars. Even if it wasn&#039;t legal, nothing would be done about it.

				Not really true.&nbsp; I had a similiar problenm on the corner of my home when it wasn&#039;t legal.&nbsp; The police showed up. Not too sure what happend but they never came back.&nbsp; Now if you see it near a school, it&#039;s a drug free zone.&nbsp; Children and adults have the right to breathe in fresh air. I&#039;d report it to the police and to the school. It just may move somewhere else but not near the kids.

I&#039;ve just never had any luck getting anything done about it when it was illegal (there was a pair that would hang out on my block all day, stinking it up. they eventually moved). I&#039;m curious if a drug free school zone means anything for reefer since it&#039;s now legal.

				i don&#039;t care for cigarette or weed smoke, but i think the exhaust from idling vehicles is worse than either.

				&nbsp; So you are talking about the many idling vehicles that are choking the areas around IS230? The bus lanes are full, the hydrants have cars parked there. Pretty much every space that could be taken that the delivery trucks on 34th have not already occupied in the cross streets. It&#039;s a zoo out there and the weed is the fragrance in the air that will mask the idling for now. <br />&nbsp; Our JH schools are not good at creating zones for pickup which mandate where caregivers and students can intersect. Jessica Ramos mentioned creating something like a scramble zone? where there is more attention to how things flow out of the schools and considers things like disabled students and neighbors which is currently not what we see happening. Not sure if she wanted the Board of Ed to do this or DOT? But it is chaotic right now in good weather.
