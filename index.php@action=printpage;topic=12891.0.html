You have to call Verizon and request it for your building. They do a site survey and attempt to install it, which takes about six months. They&#039;re in the middle of the site survey for my building.

				They keep offering us a FIOS bundle for about $80 a month, but the small print: &quot;plus installation, equipment...and other fees&quot; is off-putting. Anyone have any idea what these might amount to? <br /><br />Additionally we rent in a family-owned building so presumably the installation cost burden would fall on the elderly owners. I doubt they&#039;d be interested.<br /><br />

				I had fios for a couple of years in my old place in Brooklyn. Basically the pricing -- after all the add ons -- works out to be a couple of bucks cheaper than TWC. (I&#039;d guess after all&#039;s said and done you can expect to save $5 a month.) You get better upload speeds, and maybe marginally better customer service. (Though for all of you expecting a huge improvement over TWC&#039;s service, don&#039;t hold your breath.) There is one significant downside: The fios box, which nobody tells you about until they show up at your door, is freaking huge. Like 5 times the size of a normal TWC modem. It&#039;s a large piece of equipment that, because of the nature of fibre optic cables, needs to be close to where the fios line comes into your house. We ended up hiding it behind a bookshelf, but its something to think about.<br /><br />All in all it seems like people who don&#039;t have access to fios imagine a promised land of cheap internet. But the truth is, it&#039;s really basically the same as TWC. I&#039;d probably order fios if it came to my building, but I don&#039;t miss it hugely
