				I&#039;m curious to hear thoughts on this one.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t seen any other posts about it.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a pretty good summary of the race and the candidates: http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/8326-crowded-race-election-queens-district-attorney-and-reset-prosecutorial-agenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />And here&#039;s a quick rundown of who is endorsing who: https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/endorsements-queens-district-attorney-candidates.html&nbsp; <br /><br />Announced candidates are:<br />Tiffany Caban<br />Melinda Katz<br />Rory Lancman<br />Gregory Lasak<br />Betty Lugo<br />Mina Malik<br />Jose Nieves<br /><br />If I can try to sum it up succinctly: It seems like Lasak and Lugo are running as relative moderates with criminal justice experience; Katz and Lancman are running as politicians who see the DA as a person who can fix policy issues; and Caban, Malik and Nieves are running as criminal attorneys who want to reform the DA&#039;s office.<br />

				Also very curious to hear what people are thinking about this race. <br /><br />Progressives seem to be very excited about Cabán (https://theintercept.com/2019/03/26/tiffany-caban-queens-district-attorney/), and I like that she has such a fresh vision, informed by her work on the &quot;other side&quot;... but I have serious doubts about her level of experience and expertise, and her ability to run a large office. I think she&#039;s been a public defender (certainly an honorable job) for just a handful of years. She seems like someone with great ideas but not necessarily the right qualifications.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen much talk about Mina Malik, but at least on paper, she seems like an excellent candidate. She was an assistant DA in Queens for over a decade, so she certainly knows the ropes, and she&#039;s been an outspoken advocate of criminal justice reform. She&#039;s also run a large office (the Civilian complaint review board, which handles complaints about NYPD treatment—certain good issues for a DA to be aware of). https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11611/Malik<br /><br />It seems like it may be a race between Caban (DSA/WFP endorsement, grassroots organizing behind her), Katz (name recognition, Queens Dem machine), and Lancman, but I&#039;d love to see more in-depth coverage about all the candidates—like that Gothamist article on Caban—so that we really can make more informed choices. I know there was already one debate about a month ago, but I think more are planned.<br /><br />The Queens Daily Eagle has had ongoing coverage of this race:<br />https://queenseagle.com/all?tag=Queens+District+Attorney

				The real reason the Queens machine is pushing Katz (an obvious party hack with no criminal experience) along with Governor is to protect the corrupt criminals who run our government. This all but assures that these people feeding off the backs of hardworking people never are held to account for their corrupt assignments of positions or awarding of contracts to their members of families and donors. They know with Katz at the helm, the fix is in and all that is needed to stop an investigation is a phone call. Remember the former heads of the Assembly and Senate are in prison. This is how corrupt our system is. One party rule does this and it will now accelerate with the Senate in Democratic hands.

				Che, I can only guess at what makes your brain work the way it does. <br /><br />You use zero sum argument against the prevailing winds. That doesn&#039;t even make sense. If <em>white</em> is your issue b/c it dominates the political culture, than it would have less incentive to destroy what racists perceive as &quot;the enemy.&quot; If anything, it is the other way around. I suggest that it&#039;s the radicals that are employing such tactics to strip power from the existing institutions.

				A looong time ago, long before Sliwa, Katz was known/perceived to be lesbian. I sort of think it&#039;s true, having known her when I myself was in politics. If true, she has not used that identity to pander for the LGBTQ vote.<br /><br />Cabal DID this weekend. Disgusting.

They know with Katz at the helm, the fix is in and all that is needed to stop an investigation is a phone call. Remember the former heads of the Assembly and Senate are in prison.

Katz proved herself - don&#039;t need any more information on that. Black devil, white devil, yellow devil, red devil... Easy to pander to people&#039;s fear and a common enemy. What happens when we become the enemy? What happens when brown people become white just like Italians, Greeks, and Jews did? It&#039;s always been about power and identifying it by race is reductive and obtuse.

She has promised to stop prosecuting recreational drug use, prostitution and small-time crimes like subway fare evasion, and seek less punitive sentences for many felonies.<br /><br />Katz, 53, has the backing of state and county party leaders like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo as well as a host of unions.<br />Katz has never worked in criminal law, but was the best-financed candidate in the race. She had also promised major reforms to the district attorney&#039;s office, including curtailing prosecutions of women for prostitution.<br /><br />The winner will be favored to win the November general election to succeed longtime District Attorney Richard Brown. He died last month at age 86.<br /><br />Either Katz or Caban would be the first woman to serve as Queens district attorney.

				It seems that if you are a registered Democrat and you voted, your vote should count even if you didn’t sign your name on the line.&nbsp; The people who voted may of not been aware that you need to sign your name.

				If the bill passed both houses of the NYS legislators before the election then it is not improper to sign it into law. It lets people’s vote count regardless of minor irregularities.

				There is no conspiracy in allowing a voter that showed up and voted and forget to sign their name to have their vote count and not be the subject of a protracted legal battle. Allowing votes to count from registered Democrats is not voter fraud or favoritism. What is favoritism is what the Governor is doing by not signing the bill that clearly allows those voted to be counted. You really learn how corrupt our whole system of government truly is when these close elections occur. Very pathetic.

				During any race, IMO, the rules at the beginning should be the same as the rules at the end of the race.<br /><br />Be it the Olympics or the Attorney General of Queens.<br /><br />That&#039;s my opinion.&nbsp; And considers the ETHICS of a situation. <br /><br />Both sides are equally advantaged or disadvantaged by changing the rules midway. Both. Equally. <br /><br />The rule, currently, is &quot;sign your name&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s a perfectly reasonable rule at the beginning of the race. And remains a perfectly reasonable rule even now, to me, at the end of the race. <br /><br />If that rule is changed for the next race, then so be it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Nothing changed because we know the last 100 votes who didn’t sign the card were not counted. <br /><br />Next Cuomo refuses to sing the law allowing these votes to count. <br /><br />Then a loyal Brooklyn Democrat Judge will throw out the votes and declare Katz the winner and thus democracy is thwarted yet again.&nbsp;

Some might be for Katz. Maybe Katz voters forgot to sign. Katz voters might also be equally forgetful concerning signatures as Caban&#039;s might be.&nbsp; Your logic is...not logical.

				The further and further to the left the Democratic party is pushed by extreme progressives, radicals, and social justice warriors, the more afraid I become of a second Trump term.

				Every registered Democrat’s vote should count regardless of any signature technicality. This could mean Katz would still win, but every vote should count. People who are not registered with the Democrats cannot have their vote count. I find nothing unreasonable about this position.

Here’s Why It’s Still Not Over.<br /></strong>By Vivian WangJuly 29, 2019<br /><br /><br />(https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/29/nyregion/29queensda/merlin_156998010_719d1882-3833-4927-955d-6101efc19f8e-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp)<br /><br />Melinda Katz, the establishment favorite, was certified as the winner, but Tiffany Cabán has refused to concede.<br /><br />A recount gave Melinda Katz a 60-vote lead over Tiffany Cabán in the June 25 Democratic primary for Queens district attorney.<br />Seth Wenig/Associated Press<br /><br /><br />The New York City Board of Elections on Monday certified Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, as the winner of the June 25 Democratic primary for Queens district attorney, the culmination of a 34-day election battle that was one of the closest and most bitter in recent New York City history.<br /><br />But the board’s certification does not end the contest: One of Ms. Katz’s opponents, Tiffany Cabán, has already filed a lawsuit challenging the results, which have her losing to Ms. Katz by a mere 60 votes.<br /><br />Nor does it end the identity crisis that the race represented for the Democratic Party. Supporters of both campaigns have cast the outcome as a verdict on the future of the left, with backers of Ms. Cabán, a former public defender and democratic socialist, describing her candidacy as a rebuke to machine politics, and supporters of Ms. Katz, the favored candidate of top Democratic leaders, accusing the other side of aggravating the party’s polarization.<br /><br />That battle seemed all but certain to rage on, even as Ms. Katz claimed victory on Monday after a two-week manual recount.<br /><br />“This is a great day for the people of Queens, who have waited patiently for the long recount process to conclude,” Ms. Katz said in a statement. “While it is everyone’s right to avail themselves of the judicial process, I urge all participants in this hard-fought election to come together and join me in beginning the hard work of reforming the criminal justice system in Queens.”<br /><br />But Ms. Cabán refused to concede, citing the broader mandate of reform that she had invoked throughout the campaign, and which propelled the race to national attention.<br /><br />She said that more than 100 ballots had been improperly not counted, likening that to voter suppression.<br /><br />“This race is not over,” Ms. Cabán said at a news conference on Thursday, when the results of the recount first became clear. “Our campaign will be in court to protect Queens voters from being disenfranchised by New York’s restrictive and undemocratic voting laws.”<br /><br />Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for Ms. Cabán, called the certification a “formality” that would allow the campaign’s lawsuit to move forward.<br /><br />That the certification was seen by many as just a step rather than a final result underscored the topsy-turvy nature of the race. On the night of the election, Ms. Cabán had declared victory, citing a 1,100-vote margin. But a delayed count of paper ballots on July 3 put Ms. Katz ahead by 20 votes.<br /><br />That slim margin automatically triggered a manual recount — the first ever to span a full county, according to state elections officials. Over the past two weeks, Board of Elections staff members crowded into a nondescript mall in Queens — also home to a BJ’s Wholesale Club and a Burger King — to tally every ballot by hand, while volunteers and lawyers for both candidates stood guard.<br /><br />The recount process itself was painstaking and dull. But it unfolded against a backdrop of mistrust and mutual recrimination, as Ms. Cabán’s supporters hurled accusations of voter fraud and suppression. Ms. Katz’s supporters — including prominent elected officials such as Representative Gregory Meeks — suggested that Ms. Cabán’s backers were gentrifiers inconsiderate of nonwhite voters, many of whom supported Ms. Katz. (Ms. Katz is white, and Ms. Cabán is Latina.)<br /><br />Ms. Cabán’s supporters have already pointed to the looming court battle, when Ms. Cabán’s lawyers plan to argue that elections officials improperly discarded dozens of ballots — more than enough to flip the election yet again if reinstated.<br /><br />Many of those ballots were invalidated for technical reasons, such as an eligible Democratic voter showing up to the wrong polling site, or not writing “Democrat” on the ballot. Poll workers are responsible for ensuring that voters fill out affidavit ballots correctly, said Jerry Goldfeder, a lawyer for Ms. Cabán.<br /><br />Still, it is impossible to know how much those disputed ballots would change the outcome even if they were reinstated. Invalidated ballots were not opened, so there is no way of knowing if they would add to Ms. Cabán’s tally or Ms. Katz’s.<br /><br />It is unclear how long the court proceedings will take. In 2012, a special election for a Brooklyn State Senate seat led to an automatic recount; David Storobin, a Republican, ultimately won by 16 votes, 72 days after the election.<br /><br />In 2004, a race in Westchester County led to the longest-running contest for a Senate seat since before the Great Depression. The contest between Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic county legislator, and the Republican incumbent, Nick Spano, set off a three-month court battle that ended with an 18-vote win for Mr. Spano. (Ms. Stewart-Cousins, who won a 2006 rematch, is now the leader of the State Senate.)<br /><br />In the meantime, observers have given up on trying to predict the outcome.<br /><br />Jerry Skurnik, a longtime political consultant, said he thought Ms. Cabán would be hard-pressed to make up a 60-vote lead with about 100 disputed ballots. But then again, he said, “I thought it was hard to see how Katz could overcome an 1,100-vote margin with so few absentee ballots.<br /><br />“I’ve been completely wrong about this race,” Mr. Skurnik added. “So nothing will surprise me.”<br /><br />Correction: July 29, 2019<br />An earlier version of this article misidentified the Republican who won the special election for Brooklyn State Senate in 2012. He is David Storobin, not Daniel Sorokin.<br /><br />Vivian Wang is a reporter for the Metro Desk, covering New York State politics in Albany.

				I hated that I had to vote strategically rather than for who would have been the better QDA. I have no confidence in Katz. She, like Van Bramer and Gianaris, will embrace just enough of the socialist mantle to ensure reelection. It&#039;s sickening. But who in their right mind would vote for a DA (of all things!) that embraces dishonesty and anarchy to support a worldview of global governance and collectivism. You have to be crazy or dumb. It helps to be both.

				The DSA has an edict: Do Not Talk To Cops. Literally, we almost had a prosecutor that is so anti-cop that her field director has the edict on her twitter bio. The rule was enforced at this week&#039;s DSA convention. <br /><br />Tonight was National Night Out. Melinda Katz participated. I don&#039;t recall our local pols announcing it. Does anyone know if any of our pols or their reps attended? <br /><br />On another note, the Dems do not appear to have anyone running against AOC in 2020. So far, there are about four republicans and one interloper dem.
