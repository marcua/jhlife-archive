				Hi all!!<br /><br />I have a question to people who lives in Birchwood House.<br />My question is how come its maintenance went up rapidly in past 5 years?<br /><br />I digged out past posting and found out its maintenance used be around $500 for 1BR in 2008.&nbsp; Currently,&nbsp; the coop has several listings for sale and their maintenances are around $700.<br /><br />The building is lovely, close to subway, has parking inside.&nbsp; <br />I want to buy!!<br />But $200 up in 5 years???<br />What&#039;s happened to the building&#039;s financial?<br />Are you expecting $40 increase every year forever?<br /><br />I appreciate somebody answer my question.<br />Thank you!<br /><br />paparinkochan<br /><br /><br />

				As I just bought a coop recently, my experience told me that you can offer your price you are comfortable with and then during the contract signing time, get your time to do the due diligence. Like reading the financial documents and the board meeting minutes, if you find something you are uncomfortable with, you are free to back out. You probably have to pay several hundred dollars for the attorney. Some attorneys will not charge you unless you have signed the contract. <br /><br />Of course, if the broker/seller is helpful, ask them to give you the building&#039; financials for the past five years. A lot of them are unwilling to give those unless you give an offer price. The financial statement gives you full picture of what is going on.

				<br />Thank you for your reply, jh_coop_buyer!<br />You are right.&nbsp; I will ask the seller for the building&#039;s financials.<br />I hope he is helpful. =)<br /><br />By the way, did you hire a broker?<br />If so, do you think s/he made your buying process easier?<br />Or do you think you didn&#039;t need their help?<br />

				You currently have four (4) one bedrooms for sale at the Birchwood.&nbsp; The largest is 850 SF with a maint of $765.&nbsp; Two that are 780 SF (maint $678 &amp; $698) and one on the first floor which is 740SF with a maint of $660. These are all list on Streeteasy.&nbsp; The broker to work with is Nu Place Realty a small firm in Forest Hills who were the onsite agents when the building was selling large number of units several years ago.&nbsp; I don&#039;t consider $765 a month maint for 850SF to be excessive.&nbsp; I also have 850SF and have a monthly maint of $723 which is just $42 less and I don&#039;t have Doorman Service.&nbsp; A large 850SF unit just sold in March for $265K.&nbsp; &nbsp;When Nu Place was selling units several years ago, I visited and was very impressed with the units and the renovations.&nbsp; Also, I would not be concerned about the Birchwood have four one bedrooms for sale since the building has 159 units.&nbsp; The largest unit is located on the 7th floor and is renovated.&nbsp;

You then adjust that upwards or downwards a bit to account for extra or less amenities (i.e. doorman, terrace, additional staff, roof deck, gardens, etc.) <br />$765 by 850 SF = $0.89 / SF<br />That alone doesn&#039;t provide the whole picture since I don&#039;t know what amenities the building provides -- but a poster above mentioned that this building has a doorman, if they are full-time, that can certainly increase the maintenance a bit.

				I know mostly everyone on here will tell you to go for Pre War buildings, but there are great bargains to be had in post war buildings.<br /><br />I live on 88th street, in a large 2 bedroom about 1,000 sq feet, garage &amp; laundry in building, with a maintenance under $600. 2 bedrooms here go for less than a 1 bedroom at Birchwood.<br /><br />As much as I wanted a pre war, to me, the savings and amenities of a post war are well worth it.

When I was buying, I didn&#039;t have a choice to have my own broker (see the discussion at http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8054.0).&nbsp; As there is one major broker in jackson heights who does not allow co-brokering&nbsp; and tends to price the home higher than the other brokers (when you are looking for the apartment for a while, you will know who I am talking about), but this broker gets the inventory. I ended up buying a coop with this broker. In general, my dealing with him seems relatively smoothly. This broker is professional and you are his customer after all.&nbsp; But don&#039;t expect him to get a good price for you as he is exclusively working for the seller.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t expect that a buyer&#039;s agent is going to help me to get a good price as his primary purpose to have a deal. If the buyer&#039;s agent deems it too difficult to negotiate a good price for the buyer, he will loose the interest to work for you.<br />Here is another thread where a broker asks the seller to consider co-brokering (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8051.0). I don&#039;t think this broker is successful to convince the seller to do this as evidenced by the fact many good apartments were sold by the above mentioned no co-brokering agency. I sort of understand from the seller&#039;s point of view (The person who can get me a better price and sells faster will get to sell my apartment, co-broking or no co-broking is none of my business).<br /><br />Anyway, after you are looking for the apartment for a while, you will have a good feeling how to price the apartment correctly. acris is good source to check the price history.

				Thank you for the information, JH3525, rhydewithdis, and, eddi.<br />I understood they increased their maintenance because they invested in roof deck, doorman, and front area, so&nbsp; the current maintenance per/sf at Birchwood is not bad.&nbsp; <br />Anyway, I have to check the building&#039;s finance to predict if they need to continue increasing their maintenance $40/year or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!<br />
