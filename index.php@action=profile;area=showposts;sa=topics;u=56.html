					I have a cat climber that is covered in sisal, with two platforms for bird watching, napping, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ve had it for a number of years but it&#039;s still very serviceable.&nbsp; I had to recover the bottom (1 of 4) section because even cats that are not interested in climbing will sharpen their claws on it.<br /><br />The catch is that it was constructed for a floor to ceiling height of 9 feet and it&#039;s on spring tension so anything higher or lower will not work.&nbsp; <br /><br />My photo is too large to attach here but, if you&#039;re interested, email me and I&#039;ll send you a pic.

					<em>I am posting this for a friend.&nbsp; Inquiries should be made to newsletters@foranimals, Inc.&nbsp; Donations are also most welcome.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been procrastinating about adding a lovely feline (or two) to your household, this is the time.<br /><br />Madalyn<br /></em><br /><br />Our shelter must relocate; free adoptions to qualified homes&nbsp; <br /><br />View this email in your browser&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />A Time of Great Need<br /><br />The future of over 50 cats is at stake<br /><br />As we celebrate the start of a new season, For Animals faces a huge challenge. We have lost our shelter space of over 10 years, and must vacate within a few months. Our shelter not only houses adoptable cats and kittens, but a separate area acts as a holding space for our TNR program. <br /><br />&nbsp;We are reaching out to our supporters to ask for assistance as we begin the process of looking for another suitable space. This is not an easy task: aside from the fact that rentals are extremely costly, most landlords are unwilling to accommodate animals.<br /><br />&nbsp;In an effort to make ourselves more attractive to landlords, we are trying to reduce the number of cats in our shelter. If we can&#039;t find a new space, we don&#039;t know what will happen to the more than 50 cats and kittens currently in our care so getting them into homes is a top priority. As a way of reducing our population we are offering free adoptions to qualifying homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;We sincerely appreciate your continued support and hope to hear from you this Spring as we work through this difficult time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Sincerely,<br /><br />&nbsp;Theresa Bachu<br />&nbsp;Founder, For Animals<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />How you can help:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Adopt<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />If you have the room and the love you can assist us by adopting one of our friendly senior or young adult cats. We also have many difficult to place cats who do not like to be picked up or held, or are shy around humans; they would make great companions to other cats, and some are well suited for indoor/outdoor life (in safe areas).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Outreach<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Another way to help is by reaching out to barns or farms in the tristate area that might be&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />

					I am copying information received via a friend of a friend, about two lovely kittens that need a home.&nbsp; If you are looking, or know someone who is looking for 2 kitties, click on their Petfinder links and fall in love.&nbsp; <br /><br />You may respond directly to the original sender - Robyn Fleming - at <a href="mailto:rfleming2175@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">rfleming2175@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Madalyn<br /><br />Hello NYC friends,<br /><br /><br /><br />First of all I promise this is the last/only time you will get an email from me about this!&nbsp; I&#039;m doing everything I can to get the word out about these two wonderful kittens I&#039;ve been fostering for the past couple weeks.&nbsp; They are amazing, but I really need to find them a home ASAP.&nbsp; My own two cats have about had it and it would break my heart to return the kittens to the shelter, especially after they&#039;ve made so much progress with us.&nbsp; Please, if you or anyone you know would like to welcome these two into their homes, please forward this on, tweet their Petfinder profiles, or anything else you can think of.&nbsp; Thank you!!&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />About &quot;Callahan&quot; and &quot;Calanthia&quot;:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Callahan&#039;s Petfinder profile: <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/28734838/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/28734838/</a><br /><br />Calanthia&#039;s Petfinder profile: <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/28734849/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/28734849/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The facts:<br /><br />•They&#039;re approximately 6 months old.<br /><br />•They are brother/sister pair; the black and white one is the boy (&quot;Callahan&quot;) and the calico is the girl (&quot;Calanthia&quot;).&nbsp; I am not responsible for their names <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br />•They are bonded and should be adopted together, but might be able to be separated if there are other animals in the home to play with (the woman in charge of the shelter would decide this).<br /><br />•They LOVE other cats!&nbsp; My own cats can attest to this all too well...&nbsp; I bet they&#039;d be fine with dogs, too.<br />•They are pretty shy when you first meet them and it takes some time to earn their trust (the little calico more than the boy). But in the 2 weeks they&#039;ve been with me they&#039;ve made amazing progress.&nbsp; I know they will be wonderful, loving pets in a home that will give them the little bit of time and patience they need to learn to trust their new family. <br />•They were briefly adopted into a home with a 9-year-old child, but were returned after about 2 weeks.&nbsp; I actually met the child and can see why it wasn&#039;t a good fit - she had too much nervous energy for these kittens and didn&#039;t like that they were &quot;messy.&quot;&nbsp; The kittens would do best in a calmer home, which doesn&#039;t mean no kids or other pets - it just depends on the kids/pets!<br />•They&#039;ve had their shots; the boy has been neutered and the girl will be spayed very soon; they&#039;ve tested negative for FELV and FIV.<br />•There is a per-kitten adoption fee which covers the veterinary care they&#039;ve received and supports the shelter (The Animal Project) - trust me, the shelter needs the help.<br />•They will be at the Petco on Broadway and 92nd St. this Saturday (and every Saturday until they are adopted) from 2-6pm.&nbsp; <br />•As trusted friends/coworkers I would also welcome you or any friends of yours <br />
