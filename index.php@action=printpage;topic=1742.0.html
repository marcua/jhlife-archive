				It looks like the restaurant is open for business.&nbsp; I walked by there about an hour or so ago and noticed a colorful &quot;opened&quot; sign by the door.&nbsp; They also had a sign advertising a buffet for $8.50.&nbsp; The wait staff was inside, but I guess it was still too early in the day for customers.&nbsp; The place looks nice!

				I went to the new restaurant last night, Mehfil, and ordered a chicken curry to go. I have to say it was really good, spicy with a complex but fresh tasting sauce. The condiments that came with it were good too, so was the fresh naan. The decor is nice and clean, no liquor license yet but coming soon for beer and wine, the people there were friendly AND they deliver! I recommend it and would like to hear others opinions.

				We had take-out from them last night - chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, rice and naan.&nbsp; I concur with sb - everything was really fresh and the naan was very good.&nbsp; The spicing was really mild, so if you like spicy, ask for it.<br />It&#039;s not quite as good as Spicy Mina, which is my favorite South Asian place in the area, but definitely a good place to have around.

				wow, you guys are quick. they just opened Monday I think. looks like you were just as excited as I was. I walked in today to check out the buffet spread. Looks pretty good although not a huge selection and I was a little skeptical about the vegetable fried rice rather than biryani, oh well. the tandoori chicken looked pretty mean in a good way. <br />They serve northern indian food. I still don&#039;t exactly know what that means... more creamy? <br /><br />prices are in line with the new generation of indian restaurants. <br /><br />and, I should hope it&#039;s fresh - i don&#039;t think anything&#039;s had the chance to spoil yet!

				As Arunee was mysteriously closed today, I decided to explore the buffet here.&nbsp; Interesting display, the quarters were a little tight (the lady at the next table bumped mine every time she moved), and heavy on the fish tandori and fish curry, which I liked a lot.<br /><br />I liked the decor too.&nbsp; And the metal cups, bambooish check holders, all nice touches.

				Mehfil is our new favorite restaurant. We really enjoy the food, in particular a standout rice dish called Shahajani Pullao, a house specialty made with chicken, slivered almonds, eggs, raisinsâ€”not to be missed. My husband and I have lived in Jackson Heights for two and a half years; we regularly eat at other JH Indian restaurants, and you wonâ€™t find this dish anywhere else. Weâ€™ve ordered it three times this week alone! The Chicken Biryani is also excellent. While we do pick up food to go, we prefer to eat there. The ambience at the restaurant is peaceful and relaxed, with elegant dÃ©cor and a row of booths for a bit of privacy. And the manager and waitstaff are very professional and nice. Mehfil is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, and already we canâ€™t wait to go back.

				Mehfil hasn&#039;t yet hit favorite status for me (too much competition), but I&#039;ve tried it twice and had two good experiences.&nbsp; James_and_Faye, on your recommendation I&#039;ll try that Pullao next time.&nbsp; If you like this dish, you should also try to two delicious &quot;Palau&quot; entrees at Afghan Kebab House -- I particularly like the one with orange rinds in it.

				I was walking by Mehfil today, and spur of the moment decided I wanted to try it for dinner.&nbsp; I walked in and placed an order for takeout (Palak Paneer) and then ran across the street to Met to pick up a few items.&nbsp; My food was ready in under 15 minutes, and the people in Mehfil were very nice.&nbsp; And the palak paneer was so good!&nbsp; The portion is very large, enough for 2-3 meals and it comes with a lot of rice.&nbsp;

				My family and I went to the buffet a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it...especially the tandoori fish and bread pakora!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if bread pakora is on the regular menu, but I&#039;ve never had it outside of my mother-in-law&#039;s house (and never even seen it at a restaurant).&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a deep-fried slice of sandwich bread (usually wonder bread) covered in the normal pakora chickpea batter.

				FYI:&nbsp; If you go to website www.restaurant.com, there are Mehfil gift certificates.&nbsp; The price is $10 for a $25 gift certificate, and if you use the code &quot;SAVE&quot; you will receive 70% off and the price is only $3 for a $25 gift certificate.&nbsp; I just purchased 2 (and some for other restaurants), but have not used them yet.&nbsp; Only catch is that the certificate can only be used Sun-Thurs, for dinner, with a minimum $35 purchase.&nbsp; Link below all about restaurant.com:<br /><br />http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=3795.0

				So I went into Mehfil today as I wanted to try it and it was close to my apt so I can get delivery from them. I am sad to say that my experience was not good. Right after I was seated i moved the chutney tray that was on the table and a roach crawled out from under and walked across the table. I told the waitress and left...

				I did not have a good experience at this restaurant.&nbsp; I usually try samosas at every Indian restaurant. If they can get the pastry dough right, then they usually know what they are doing.&nbsp; Not only was the doughthick &amp; tough, they apparently fried them in very old oil.&nbsp; not good.

				That&#039;s too bad about the samosa.&nbsp; I rarely order them from anywhere because they are generally greasy or they taste like they&#039;ve been sitting around.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the last time I ordered from Mehfil, my friend wanted samosas so we ordered them.&nbsp; They were great -the dough was light and they weren&#039;t greasy at all.&nbsp; I guess it depends on timing and luck.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love their paneer makhani.&nbsp; It&#039;s the best I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood.&nbsp;

				Just want to add to this thread, that Mehfil&#039;s brunch is the freshest, tastiest Indian brunch I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood, hands-down. It still puzzles me why certain JH restaurants (not to be named here) have such a stellar reputation among Manhattanites, when to my opinion they only run in the middle of the pack.

				We continue to take out from Mehfil regularly (on average two times a week) and enjoy the high quality of the food. Last week we were able to go to the restaurant and sit down to eat. We tried the Paneer Bhurji and it&#039;s a new favorite. Also ordered the Mint Paratha--it tastes like mint tea in bread form!

				Gladly! Paneer Bhurji is a vegetarian dish. It&#039;s mashed-up paneer, the Indian cottage cheese, along with onions, tomato, garlic, and green chiles, along with ginger, turmeric, and cumin. Heavenly over rice. The consistency is often described as similar to scrambled eggs, but it&#039;s more gravy-like. <br /><br />Other dishes at Mehfil that we&#039;ve had that include paneer are: Vegetable Malai Kofta, Mattar Paneer (paneer cubes with peas), and Paneer Palak (paneer with spinach). They&#039;re all good, but the Paneer Bhurji is extra special. Definitely try it!

				I ordered from them last night (my third time, I think) and the food was terrible. Maybe it was just an &quot;off&quot; night, but it was a serious decline from the last time I ordered. So much so, in fact, that I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll order again. I ordered lamb korma and the lamb was mostly gristle. The korma itself had very little flavor. It was a big disappointment.

				I&#039;ve found the (vegetarian) food to be deliciously consistent...<br /><br />And I am NOT clicking on the health inspection link!&nbsp; I just can&#039;t do it.. especially since I have Mehfil leftovers in my fridge.&nbsp; My thoughts are that since they got a poor health inspection, they have to fix it in order to continue operations.&nbsp; Therefore, they must be MORE clean now.&nbsp; Hoping...

				Mehfil went from perfect to several violations in the span of one month, but none of the violations seem that bad.&nbsp; Every restaurant in any city will have some mice nibbling the crumbs on the floor from time to time (I once worked in a kitchen of a nice restaurant where the mice would eat tunnels through the fancy bread!).&nbsp; Many restaurants in JH and Elmhurst have been nailed recently by the health dept...it seems like every place my family eats regularly!

				I&#039;ve always gone back and forth with this restaurant.&nbsp; On the plus side the food was lighter than most Indian I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; On the other hand, it wasn&#039;t as intensely flavored.&nbsp; I guess the two are connected.<br /><br />In any event, I don&#039;t see these as just minor health violations.&nbsp; They received 60 violation points, which is quite high by any standard.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll go back.

				I was reluctant to post this when it happened but in light of the health code violations I guess I will.&nbsp; I ordered delivery from them last month (dinner time) and at 10 am the next morning came down with the worst food poisoning I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I was sick for a full week and missed four days of work.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that it&#039;s nearly impossible to tell where one acquires food poisoning and that it could be from something I ate earlier.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to blame Mehfil because I don&#039;t know if it was their food that got me sick.&nbsp; I was even willing to give them another chance but now I will have to think about it.&nbsp; 60 violation points is quite high.&nbsp;

				I hate to post this, but here goes!&nbsp; Given that people are expressing worry about this particular restaurant&#039;s health code violations, it is important to provide some context.&nbsp; You can get the last few years of health inspection reports for any restaurant in the city at this website:<br /><br />http://167.153.150.32/RI/web/index.do;jsessionid=3D16B2434E13AFC783E1E451DB231664?method=goldenAppleList (http://167.153.150.32/RI/web/index.do;jsessionid=3D16B2434E13AFC783E1E451DB231664?method=goldenAppleList)<br /><br />It&#039;s not pretty for most restaurants...for example, here are the reports for Kabab King over the last few years.&nbsp; They have been closed more than once by the DOH, having earned scores of 52, 65, and 71 (for paperwork violations, improper use of rat poison, etc).&nbsp; They also earned some 0&#039;s during that period.&nbsp; Again, I post this information to provide context and not to pick on anybody or any particular restaurant (and Kabab King is right next to my building...have eaten there.&nbsp; Find the food OK but think they coast a bit on reputation).<br /><br />KABAB KING<br />73-01 37 ROAD, QUEENS 11372<br />718-457-5857<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;06/12/2008<br />73-01 37 ROAD, QUEENS 11372<br />Inspection Date: 06/12/2008<br />Violation points: 0<br /><br />Establishment re-opened by DOHMH<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;06/11/2008<br />73-01 37 ROAD, QUEENS 11372<br />Inspection Date: 06/11/2008<br />Violation points: 39<br /><br />Establishment Closed by DOHMH.

				I can report that I ordered from Mehfil again this past Friday night and had another good experience. The Chicken Tikka Masala was excellent as was the Paneer Palak. (On a previous occasion I had ordered the Chicken Shahi Korma and Channa Masala, and found them both to be excellent as well, as are their breads.) The gentleman who took my order was extremely polite and the food was delivered in about a half hour. <br /><br />As has been already pointed out, you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a restaurant in the city that has not at some time or other been sited in a health inspection. (One of my favorite Manhattan lunch spots was once closed for two weeks by the Department of Health... I had eaten there an average of twice a week and never got sick or saw anything that made me suspect their kitchen was not &quot;up to code.&quot;) In my way of thinking, it&#039;s not such a bad idea to patronize a restaurant that has recently been sited: Unless the owners are complete morons, they are usually conscientious about fixing the violations in order to pass their follow-up inspection with as few points as possible.

				In a non-violation related story, they must have a wider delivery area than most local resturants.&nbsp; One day this week at my school, a student of mine from Elmhurst (specifically, somewhat near PS 7) came in holding an menu (he tends to hold a paper from whatever is in his lobby to show me, its his thing) from this place.<br /><br />I&#039;m like, whoa they deliver that far down Broadway!<br /><br />
