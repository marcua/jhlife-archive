Even if he&#039;s not someone to emulate or look up to, he did, in my opinion, write some pretty powerful words. Stuff that goes on in prison is worse than I had even imagined, and i&#039;ve heard some personal stories. One of my co-workers (also a former gang member), has given me the lowdown.

					They should only read something written by Tookie Roberts during his 20 years on death row before Arnie pulled the switch.&nbsp; Lots of kids think being in a gang or going to prison is going to be a better lifestyle than what they&#039;re around. Some of them have little or no identity and apparently gangs and gang-speak give them this. I&#039;m not so shocked by that website though.

So, I guess gangs and crime are across all cultures. My guess is the drugs involved are forms of opiates and/or marijuana. Just a guess.

As per the &quot;filth&quot; element, I actually feel sorry for some of those that prostitute themselves, and even some of the &quot;clientele&quot; (those who have serious and very real sex addictions). What I consider the real evil to be is those that take advantage of others weaknesses and prey upon them.
