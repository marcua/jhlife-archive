Here are the details of these numbers<br /><a href="http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-DL424A_NYMET_16U_20150213151208.jpg" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-DL424A_NYMET_16U_20150213151208.jpg</a><br /><br />For all of these neighborhoods, only the sale listed on streeteasy have been collected. Not many properties in Queens, Brooklyn and Bronx, Staten Island are listed on streeteasy, that is why they only had less than 100 sales in each neighborhood. Queens Douglaston has only 18 sales on streeteasy. <br /><br />Second of all, the median sale price is not apple and apple comparisons. So if 2013 sale was about all big apartments while 2014 sale was only about studios and one bedroom, you will see median price decrease even though the same apartment has increased more than 20%.<br /><br />To really understand the price trend, we really should focus on the manhanttan condo index <a href="http://streeteasy.com/nyc/market/condo_index" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/nyc/market/condo_index</a>, which is based on the sale history of the same apartment, so there is no problem of comparing apple and orange. <br /><br />The condo index does not cover Jackson Heights or Queens. The best thing for Jackson Heights will be from <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jhrealestatereport.com/</a>, collected by the knowledgeable local realtor Daniel Karatzas. He even collected the sale price in each well known buildings in Jackson Heights and divided it according to apartment size so one can easily spot the trend.<br />

To press a thorough investigations, it would require serious efforts (monetarily and emotionally and legally) and would probably a full time job itself.

					It would be interesting to notice that all recent fires in Jackson Heights happened at the 37th ave as far as I know, none in the side street area. <br /><br />The previous two fires have paid the landlords handsomely. A new condo building (84th st and 37th Ave) is built after the fire.&nbsp; The rebuilt Brunson building (37th ave and 74th st) after the fire will attract higher rents.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if this new fire (whether intentional or not) will result in a new condo building or a rebuilt building. In one way or the other, some low rent paying tenants have to move out.&nbsp;

The link for history is broken just for your building (Carlton House). I looked at the active listing of this building, all are by Douglas Elliman. My suspicion is that Douglas Elliman can pay some money to streeteasy to have the history of this building blocked. Of course, one can always use acris to find out the sale price, just a little bit cumbersome.

You can look for the charter schools, the nearest one is next to the public library at 81st street. There are other charter schools in Long Island City and Astoria. Of course, some families test into the gift and talented program. <br /><br />The non-public schools options are the catholic schools (one is St Joan of Arc at 82nd st and another one close by is St Sebastian in Woodside). If you have money to spend, the garden school near Travers Park is a good option.

					I am also kind of know the ins and outs of the real estate transactions. I spent a lot of time on the streeteasy, nyt, redfin, acris and Columbia real estate floor plan brochure (The last one is super helpful as many realtors don&#039;t publish floor plans) when I bought my first apartment a couple of years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I also wished I had used a good local experienced agent as a buyer agent to help me to negotiate the price in Jackson Heights&nbsp; (see the long thread at <a href="index.php@topic=8054.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=8054.0</a>). As some else mentioned, there are some pocket lists around which are only open to the local realtors. There are a couple of reasons for the existing of the pocket lists. <br /><br />1. The owner is hesitate to sell and still lives in the apartment. He does not want his apartment to be publicly seen at every corner of the world.&nbsp; This is extremely helpful if the owner changes his mind and does not want to the sell the apartment at a later time so he can still live in the apartment peacefully and with the privacy.<br />2. The pocket listing will not have the listing history at streeteasy or multiple listing service so he can test the water as many times as he wish without the consequence of giving the wrong impression that the apartment is able to sale.<br /><br />For these reasons, I understand some people just give the apartment info to the local realtors, who may advertise the apartment at NYT (sometimes with the address disclosed, but the apartment number is never disclosed). In this case, there is definitively no co-broking.

When people just had the online info for the wrecked apartment 2B and mistakenly assumed it was on second floor.&nbsp; The information obtained online in conjunction with the incorrect assumption is a recipe for confusion. The most reliable information should come from a local realty expert such as jhlifer or an actual visit of the apartments.<br /><br />It&#039;s also interesting to note that Queens Brownstoner also picked the incorrect info from this thread <a href="http://queens.brownstoner.com/2015/01/listing-of-the-day-33-16-81st-street/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queens.brownstoner.com/2015/01/listing-of-the-day-33-16-81st-street/</a>

					There is a floor plan for the another building&nbsp; (33-27 80th st) at the tower in the streeteasy<br /><br /><a href="http://streeteasy.com/sale/484328-coop-33-27-80th-street-jackson-heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://streeteasy.com/sale/484328-coop-33-27-80th-street-jackson-heights</a><br /><br /><img src="http://cdn-img3.streeteasy.com/nyc/image/31/10388231.gif?_ga=1.134118344.797227809.1419679273" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />I&#039;m not sure of the floor about the the particular building that has the 519K apartment. However, the right apartment of the above is definitely a classic 7 (3 formal bedrooms, one maid room, and a dining room, and a living room, and a kitchen), which was described from mpc properties.<br /><br />The 1/2 bedroom apartment (in the rear or in the garden) could be constructed by including the top two bedrooms (near the garden) and the two bath rooms and the kitchen next to them and the entrance/livingroom/foryer could be from the bedroom near the entrance.<br /><br />By doing this type of split, the front of the classic 7 would be a small one bedroom or a big studio apartment (the maid room would become a small kitchen).
