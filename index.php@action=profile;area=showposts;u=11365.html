					My only request is better, fresher produce.&nbsp; I spent $7 on organic apples once there and came home.&nbsp; They were all rotten.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t have the time to go back and return them.&nbsp; Also, if they could keep the prices reasonable, that would be great too.

Let me see if I&#039;m understanding it. The schools need to adjust to serve the majority of kids. In JH&#039;s case, we have many ESL and low income students. Therefore, students who excel would need external mentoring, because most of the system&#039;s resources are focused in bringing up the base (that is low income and ESL). Is that more or less it?<br /><br />Comparing with schools in Park Slope or in Forest Hills: are those schools, then, better mostly because they have more affluent students enrolled? They don&#039;t have to spend as many resources dealing with ESL and low income, so they can focus on other areas. Am I right? So... the problem of school excellence is not so much with the school system but with how to bring low income and ESL to the level of wealthy students. Is that essentially it?<br /><br />(I apologize if my conclusion is completely dumb or known to everyone. This is new to me: I came to the U.S. after college and am trying to figure out the system because I had a baby last year. Thanks.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is not at all what I was saying.&nbsp; Having ESL and Title 1 status does not make a school good or bad nor does it tax an individual school&#039;s resources.&nbsp; Money is allocated along different &quot;lines&quot; to schools.&nbsp; ESL falls under Title III funds which schools only receive based on the number of English Language Learners they have.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that parents need to be involved in their child&#039;s education and not leave it all up to the school.&nbsp; In wealthier suburban districts and NYC public schools, you see VERY active PTAs that do a lot of fundraising.&nbsp; This helps schools out immensely.&nbsp; In terms of teaching, curriculum, etc., there is not a lot of difference between schools in our neighborhood and schools in the suburbs.&nbsp; The difference can be felt in terms of infrastructure, resources (technology and upkeep of existing technology), facilities, and enrichment opportunities.&nbsp;

This was very helpful. Another question, if I may: what are the odds that a child going to school here will enter a very top university? Will children going to school in JH be able to compete with kids from a rich suburb?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a hard question to answer.&nbsp; From my perspective, I think it depends a lot on the family and the parent involvement.&nbsp; If college is a priority for your family, you will seek out opportunities within the public school system to prepare your child.&nbsp; I have seen students excel at the elementary school level and get into the top middle schools and high schools in the city.&nbsp; I do not teach in Jackson Heights, but have taught in two different neighborhoods in the city both with similar populations to JH.&nbsp; As a parent myself, I make learning central to our family life.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though my daughter is a baby, we visit museums, farms, the library, parks, etc.&nbsp; I plan to find outside art classes for her later on since most schools do not have funding for art anymore.&nbsp; I also plan to find sports programs or music classes depending on her interest because those are also areas that are lacking in the public schools.&nbsp; I may opt her out of testing when she is in 3rd grade depending on what the educational atmosphere is like at that time.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t comment directly on any of the schools in the neighborhood, but I can say based on my experience as a public school teacher, I am confident that I will find the right local school for my child and be able to send her to a public school that will prepare her for the future.&nbsp; Hope that helps!&nbsp;

					It&#039;s so hard to even reply to this thread in a way that makes sense because the whole thing really doesn&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; In a nutshell, test scores mean something and they don&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just run down a list of things to remember when interpreting this data.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The 3rd grade math test has 7th grade level algebra problems in it.<br />2.&nbsp; In the ELA, 3rd graders had to cite text in their responses.<br /><br />So... do I think this test actually tells us anything about where our 3rd and 4th graders are academically? My answer is:&nbsp; very little.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said... some schools did drastically better than others.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; You really have to interpret the data differently for each school.&nbsp; Here is why.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; English language learners have to take the test after only 10 months in the country.&nbsp; 10 months!&nbsp; Imagine you come from another country and don&#039;t speak any English, but maybe have a strong academic background, you probably won&#039;t do so well after only 10 months.&nbsp; Schools with high ELL populations and new arrivals tend to do worse on the test.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean they are bad schools.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Our neighborhood has a lot of fantastic dual language programs.&nbsp; Students in dual language programs do worse on tests in 3rd and 4th grade.&nbsp; They don&#039;t reap the benefits of becoming literate in 2 language systems until 5-7 years in the program (that&#039;s 4th grade at the earliest for students that started DL in Kindergarten).&nbsp; If you look at their performance in high school, they regularly outperform their monolingual counterparts in several longitudinal studies on the subject.&nbsp; So, if the school has a dual language program, the students may score lower, but actually be performing on a higher academic level.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The test was written by Pearson publishing.... Pearson publishing: a FOR PROFIT organization.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The test is supposed to measure &quot;college and career readiness&quot; based on the Common Core Standards.&nbsp; These have no research base... read the Diane Ravitch article above.&nbsp; <br /><br />5.&nbsp; Does anyone remember the talking pineapple?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/talking-pineapple-question-state-exam-stumps-article-1.1064657" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/talking-pineapple-question-state-exam-stumps-article-1.1064657</a><br /><br />I&#039;m a teacher in NYC. I love my job.&nbsp; I love my school.&nbsp; I love my students.&nbsp; I think a lot of schools are fantastic.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to interpret this data.&nbsp; You know and love your children.&nbsp; ADVOCATE for them!&nbsp;

					As a teacher AND a parent, all I can say is that the NYC public schools have tons of opportunities for students but you have to know how to navigate the system.&nbsp; I&#039;d say ask on the JH families yahoo group and find out about people&#039;s experiences.&nbsp; School report cards honestly mean very little.&nbsp; A school can get an A, but be a total nightmare, likewise, some of the highest performing schools have Cs because they don&#039;t meet AYP (annual yearly progress).&nbsp; Schools get extra credit for servicing high-needs groups, and getting students to make more than a year&#039;s progress.&nbsp; If students are already high performing and getting 4s on the tests, how can you prove more than a year&#039;s progress?&nbsp; Also, the SQR (school quality review, available on the statistics link for each school) is a good resource, but again, not the only indicator.&nbsp; It will have a narrative description of what the school does well and what it is working on.&nbsp; Schools are scored with &quot;well-developed, proficient, developing, etc.&quot;&nbsp; While getting &quot;well-developed&quot; is a good sign, some &quot;proficient&quot; schools are excellent as well.&nbsp; The parent and teacher surveys is also good indicators of the atmosphere at a school.&nbsp; Bottom line:&nbsp; visit your zoned school, enter your child into the lottery for every lottery school in the district and ones out of district that you would feel comfortable commuting to, get your child tested for gifted and talented (not because the programs are necessarily better, but because it may give you more choice of schools), and talk to other parents.&nbsp; Good luck!

					I reported a bunch too including one directly in front of my building.&nbsp; When I called 311 they said it would be stickered in 24 hours and towed within 72 hours.&nbsp; No sticker, no tow, still sitting there 5 days later.&nbsp; This is infuriating.&nbsp; People say that the police have worse things to worry about... but how hard is it to tow or boot a car?&nbsp; My car would be towed in a second if I were illegally parked.&nbsp; They are all over Eastern Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst now around 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, and 89th street both north and south of Northern Blvd.&nbsp; I had never seen them around here until this past week and they are everywhere taking up much needed residential parking spaces.&nbsp; Why can&#039;t they be towed?&nbsp; This is ridiculous, they have phone numbers painted on them, so it&#039;s very easy to get in touch with whomever is doing this.&nbsp; Quality of life issue, public nuisance, whatever you want to call it, it&#039;s downright ILLEGAL.&nbsp;
