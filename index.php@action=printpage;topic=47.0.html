				I have a new favorite bread in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It&#039;s the &quot;all natural sunflower and grain&quot; bread from the Polish Market on 37th Ave around 80th St.&nbsp; It&#039;s baked fresh and (looking at the label) comes from a bakery in Corona.&nbsp; I have also tried a few other varieties there and they&#039;ve also been good (including the light rye).<br /><br />Occasionally the Polish place also has smoked salmon for a very reaonable price.&nbsp; But they seem to run out quickly.<br /><br />Anyone else have any great finds?

				Here&#039;s a unique item mentioned in today&#039;s NY Times...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/dining/12off.html?ref=dining<br />Off the Menu<br />By FLORENCE FABRICANT<br />Published: December 12, 2007<br /><br />In the Market<br /><br />With the approval of imports of Jamón Ibérico from Spain last week, shipments are arriving at stores. Among them, in New York: Agata &amp; Valentina, where the ham is selling for $71.96 a pound; Grace&#039;s Marketplace, where it is $90 a pound; Dean &amp; DeLuca, which has it for $87 a pound; and Blue Apron Foods in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which has it for $95 a pound. Despaña Foods in SoHo and Jackson Heights, Queens, charges $90 a pound sliced by machine, $99 by hand. </span><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow!&nbsp; What&#039;s that about?&nbsp; According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam%C3%B3n_ib%C3%A9rico), Jamón Ibérico is made from black Iberian pigs, the only type of pig that eats mainly acorns.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a big ham fan, but if my next lottery ticket is a winner, I&#039;m heading straight to Despaña Foods to taste the stuff.&nbsp; Interestingly, however, according to the Wikipedia article, the very best quality Jamón Ibérico, the mainly acorn-fed variety known as <em>bellota</em>, won&#039;t be available in the U.S. until July. <br /><br /><em>UPDATE, Dec. 13: More on this from Ed Levine (http://edlevineeats.seriouseats.com/2007/12/iberico-ham-deliciousness-alert.html)</em>

				I like the baked goods at La Nueva Bakery, but my absolute favorite item has to be the spinach empanada.&nbsp; The filling is generous and very flavorful.&nbsp; The chicken and beef are great as well.&nbsp; I purchased an assortment of the empanadas for large gatherings, and on each occasion, they&#039;ve disappeared rather quickly!&nbsp; Delicious!

				I have to say Espana foods is pretty impressive. I&#039;ve been there twice. Interesting, I was in Forest Hills, several days ago.&nbsp; I purchased some cheese from the cheese shop, and when I got home, I realized that it smelled, it was outdated by dec 17, 2007. I threw it away. Seems that a shop that is Zaget rated would be more careful of their product.

				Terma Serrano (http://umamimart.blogspot.com/2008/02/fridgin-out.html), an unusual-sounding beverage, is available from &quot;a little Argentinian bakery in Jackson Heights&quot; -- possibly La Nueva 2000?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t been there in a while, but they used to have a sign that showed the flags of multiple nationalities.&nbsp; In any case, I thought they were the likely vendor they&#039;re a bakery that also has some refrigerator &amp; freezer cases with packaged goods.
