				Does anyone know of - and ideally have positive experience with -&nbsp; a Reliable JH wash &amp; fold laundry service, preferably with pickup &amp; delivery to the 70&#039;s?<br /><br />&nbsp;If no pickup &amp; delivery, must be in low 80s or high 70s.....<br /><br />

				Zhen Wei Laundry, 3712 75 St, 718 396 0088.&nbsp; They pick up and deliver.&nbsp; Read the yelp reviews.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used them for many years and never had a problem.

				One further comment in the event you use Zhen Wei Laundry.&nbsp; The couple who operate this laundry do not own it.&nbsp; It&#039;s owned by his uncle.&nbsp; For this reason, I insist they accept a tip even though they&#039;re against it.&nbsp;

				We use Young&#039;s Laundry.&nbsp; They are on 78th street, just up the street from Lemon Tree vegetable stand. The service is excellent, they fold everything nicely, and the shirts are placed on a hanger.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think they drop off/pickup.&nbsp; <br />Now I try to buy only non-iron dress shirts, so this has eliminated my dropping shirts off at the cleaners.&nbsp; <br />Usually I drop off early Saturday morning, and I pick it up later in the day.&nbsp;

				we use Tide One, which is between 76th and 77th on 37th ave.&nbsp; the owner does most of the pickups and deliveries himself, they&#039;re very good and very reliable. the space has gone through a few owners over the years, but this gentleman seems to be in it for the long haul. highly recommended.
