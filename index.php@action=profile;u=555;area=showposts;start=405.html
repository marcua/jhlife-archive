					Still relatively new to the neighborhood, so I&#039;ll bite... What&#039;s the big objection to the kiosk? Is it unsightly? Does it block pedestrian traffic? Are you concerned it will create litter? I&#039;d just like to know why all the residents in your building (across the street) are up in arms about it. As a customer of that Astoria Federal bank branch, I can tell you that a newspaper kiosk would be rather low on my list of concerns about that intersection.<br />

					<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The real problem however is perhaps with the word gentrification its self. It would be interesting to explore the roots of the word (any English teachers out there?) as I don&#039;t think it was meant to be a positive term. Community development, renaissance, chage etc. good terms gentrification seems to have a negative connotation.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From Wikipedia:<br />The root of &quot;gentrification&quot;, &quot;gentry&quot;, derives from the Old French word genterise (a variant of gentilise), meaning the people of noble birth. Sociologist Ruth Glass coined the term in 1964 to mean the influx of wealthier individuals into cities or neighborhoods who replace working or lower-classes already living there. She defined it by using London districts such as Islington as her example: One by one, many of the working class quarters of London have been invaded by the middle-classesâ€”upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottagesâ€”two rooms up and two downâ€”have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences [...]. Once this process of &#039;gentrification&#039; starts in a district it goes on rapidly until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention defines gentrification as &quot;transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value.&quot;<br /><br />And now my thoughts:<br />So it DOES have a built-in negative connotation, although one must assume a radical liberal bias based on the word&#039;s origin. Oddly enough, when predominantly white middle-class families moved away from the cities and out to the suburbs, these same sociologists ALSO blamed them for the resulting urban decay via the phenomenon they called &quot;white flight&quot;.

Change is good, most of the time and I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to go to sleep in lovely little JH one night and wake up in hipsterland the next morning. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why is it that certain people only see &quot;gentrification&quot; as one of society&#039;s evils? <br /><br />Having lived in South Park Slope for a number of years before moving to Jackson Heights, I certainly do NOT feel that way. The gentrification that occurred while I lived in that neighborhood brought vast improvements to the quality of life for everyone living there... cleaner and safer streets, improved city services, higher quality shopping and dining options, and higher property values. I know this last item is the one that usually has all the &quot;bleeding hearts&quot; screaming about people being forced out of the neighborhood, but I simply didn&#039;t find that to be the case. Most existing homeowners were happy to sell their property for several times what they had paid, especially when many had done nothing to upkeep or improve their homes over the many years (in some cases, decades) that they had been living there. In virtually every case on my particular block, the new homeowners had to make a significant additional investment in their property (plumbing, electrical, structural, and aesthetic renovations), however, their investment not only increased the value of their property, but all of their neighbors&#039; as well.<br /><br />[The one significant downside to &quot;gentrification&quot; in this city is the seeming lack of community board oversight when it comes to overzealous developers. I DO believe that a neighborhood&#039;s character and architectural heritage need to be preserved, as I&#039;ve stated in one or two other threads on this bulletin board.]

					Okay, I feel the need to further elaborate my concerns. I am not opposed to new development by any means, but as a longtime resident of Queens, I know that our neighborhood will only benefit from new construction that is well thought-out. Having grown up in Woodside and now happily living in the heart of&nbsp; the Jackson Height historic district, I have seen far too many single-family homes with beautiful front and back yards disappear, only to be replaced by hideous multi-family apartment dwellings that lacked a single shrub for landscaping. My earlier reference to the blight of Main Street has much to do with an &quot;Asian&quot; aesthetic (or lack thereof) in which the developer builds on top of every available inch of ground, without regard for pedestrian traffic, public spaces, greenery, or neighborhood character.<br /><br />Just a few things to consider: The medical offices alone will bring more congestion to this already very busy intersection... Are these offices in any way going to be affiliated with nearby Elmhurst Hospital Center? Does the developer already have tenants committed to leasing this space? Where will the entrance/exits to the parking garage be located, and is this public parking or for tenants only? <br /><br />I only bring questions like these up because I want responsible development in our neighborhood.

					I&#039;m sorry, but I am not very hopeful that the building about to rise in this spot is going to enhance our community... a Flushing architect? I&#039;ve avoided Main Street for the past decade, and this sounds to me as if it&#039;s the expansion of the eyesore known as Broadway from Elmhurst into Jackson Heights. Who gave the okay for this project? Was this reviewed and approved by the community board? And who in their right mind would want to live in an apartment overlooking the 74th Street #7 station??

					I just thought I would share this information with all TimeWarner Cable customers: I posted in this thread a few weeks back but then all the problems seemed to clear up for a few weeks... until three weekends ago when my service (phone and internet) went down for three days. I thought my cable modem to blame and TWC sent a serviceman to come replace it. He checked the line and informed me that the signal coming into our building was at a frequency that was higher than the standard operating range of the cable modem... a problem that TWC technicians had to fix from the street level. Sure enough, since then my service has been fine again. <br /><br />Slightly off-topic: Is anybody else as outraged as I am by TWC&#039;s upcoming rate increase? I&#039;m especially insulted by their latest marketing gimmick--locking down a rate for the next two years--considering that Verizon has now entered the market in NYC and could be offering FioS service by then. Or am I foolish to think that competition might actually bring rates down?&nbsp; <img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />

					Todd... Did you really believe that Bloomberg&#039;s congestion pricing plan was going to improve mass transit for the people of the outer boroughs? <br /><br />If anything, I envisioned it making matters much worse for Queens commuters by adding more cars to our streets (i.e., those Long Islanders who would end up doing the park-and-ride from Jackson Heights, Forest Hills, or Jamaica in order to save themselves the congestion fee) and adding more riders to the already overcrowded subway lines serving those neighborhoods. As it is, the price of gasoline has caused ridership to increase on the E and F lines enough to make my morning and evening commutes miserable!

					I too have Earthlink service through TimeWarner Cable and I must report that I have been having extensive problems in recent weeks. However, my problem is connectivity rather than speed. I seem to be losing my ISP connection intermittently (several times a week), which requires that I reboot my cable modem. Further complicating matters is the fact that I have home phone service through Earthlink as well, so this ISP disconnection also disables incoming/outgoing calls. Until I read your post, I was beginning to suspect that my cable modem was at fault but perhaps there is another explanation? (Just for reference, I live on 80th Street between 35th and 37th Avenues.)

Then vote for politicians who will do the hard and dirty work. Vote for politicians who will make sure that our tax money is well spent in programs that will allow at least one parent in a household to stay home taking care of their children. And if the household only has one parent, then make sure there are programs to help that parent. Vote for politicians who will go after inflation, poor education and who will fight for salary increases. Vote for politicians who would rather spend out tax money on programs for the people instead of giving subsidies to big corporations. Vote for politicians who will create true Universal Healthcare so that people don&#039;t go broke paying for medical bills.&nbsp; And if that politician doesn&#039;t exist.

Forget the surveillance cameras and put more cops on foot patrol. And adopt a zero-tolerance policy for public drunkenness, loitering, lewd/vulgar behavior, loud music and noise, littering, graffiti, and a strict enforcement of standards for all businesses operating legally along the avenue (and closure for those businesses operating without the proper licenses and permits). If you&#039;re willing to do that, then we can ALL tackle the larger issues like universal healthcare, better schools for our kids, and meaningful economic development.<br />
