				My mother is coming to visit in April!!!&nbsp; She&#039;s a polio survivor and has trouble walking long distances and stairs.&nbsp; This is my 4th apartment and I have an elevator now so she&#039;s finally able to come visit my home... I&#039;m crazy excited - after all these years she&#039;ll see that I do actually clean my room and vacuum without having to be threatened with being grounded first :2funny:<br /><br />She&#039;s been to NYC before so she doesn&#039;t need to do a lot of sightseeing and will mostly be visiting with friends and family but we will want to go out some.&nbsp; Does anyone have suggestions for wheelchair rentals? And anything besides taxis and zipcar (both of which I&#039;ll be using) to ease getting around?&nbsp; she CAN walk its just with a couple canes, and since she&#039;s such a trooper she keeps going long after she should.... a scenario I want to avoid.<br /><br />Ideas for things to do would be appreciated too..<br />We are thinking dinner cruise around Manhattan (she loves boats and water) - anyone have any suggestions regarding those just in general?<br />She wants to see Ellis Island... I know a limited number of wheelchairs are available but I&#039;d rather not be at the mercy of first-come-first-served&nbsp; :-\<br /><br /><br />

				That is so exciting!!&nbsp; I hope she enjoys her visit.<br /><br />I can&#039;t help with any direct personal advice but I did find this website that might be good for a start.<br />http://www.nyc.com/visitor_guide/disabled_and_mature_travelers.75846/editorial_review.aspx<br /><br />Perhaps others will have some personal recommendations.

				oh, Mary&nbsp; :)<br /><br />i know this feeling...my mom has MS and has difficulty navigating NYC, although she too can walk short distances.<br /><br />i&#039;ve rented a wheelchair at maram pharmacy at 37th and 77th, and i believe the surgical supply store on roosevelt at 75th street also offers that option. it&#039;s been a couple of years since&nbsp; mom&#039;s last visit, so i don&#039;t recall prices.<br /><br />we&#039;ve done the basic circle line cruise...a three hour manhattan circling, not the two hour half-loop....and that&#039;s nice provided you have the right seat (one side is better than the other). no real experience with a dinner cruise, though.<br /><br />happy that you&#039;re getting to have this visit!

				Can she take advantage of Access-a-Ride or do you have to be a NYC resident?

				Wheelchair rentals are very expensive. I would suggest you purchase a lightweight standard wheelchair. It doesn&#039;t have all the bells/whistles like swing away foot rests or calf pads but they are much cheaper and lighter and fold easy. Rite aid,CVS and other pharmacies usually have them on sale for under $100. You might also look at craigslist. We&#039;ve given away ALOT of medical supplies (most new) and they always give them away on craigslist or sell cheaply. Acess-A-Ride is unreliable and I do believe you need to be a nyc resident and go through alot of red tape. There are alot of buses that go into the city and the MTA has a site where they list the accessible&nbsp; train stations (also check to make sure the elevators are working) You might also consider getting her folding canes (if she doesn&#039;t already have any) so if she does decide to use the chair to rest the canes are easier to hold. I would steer clear of those big walkers with the three wheels and hand brakes I find they go too fast and sometimes the persons grip isn&#039;t too great for the brakes. Just a few thoughts. Enjoy your mom&#039;s visit!!
