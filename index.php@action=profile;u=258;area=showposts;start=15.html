					I just wanted to say that this is the most â€œdemocraticâ€ exercise that I have ever been asked to participate in by an elected official.<br /><br />We live in an era in which the City is broke.&nbsp; The State is broke.&nbsp; And legislators are facing a disturbing set of options.&nbsp; They can cut basic services.&nbsp; Firehouses?&nbsp; Schools?&nbsp; Or they can risk the wrath of teapartiers, and come up with revenue generating strategies.<br /><br />I, for one, strongly support generating revenue.&nbsp; I have mixed feelings about some of the revenue generating ideas presented in this survey, but some of them just make sense.&nbsp; A small increase in fees for birth certificates and death certificates?&nbsp; &nbsp;And I do support a progressive tax that would put a higher burden on higher income families.&nbsp; Soda tax?&nbsp; Absolutely!&nbsp; I read that many tens of millions of dollars would be generated by a tax on plastic surgery procedures.&nbsp; That option was not listed, but I wrote it in.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are all going to live with the consequences of the difficult decisions that our elected representatives make this year.&nbsp; I really appreciate this opportunity contribute to this process.&nbsp; <br />

					Taggie, I suspect that you are right, and that the police had been to that corner before, and that is probably why they were in no hurry to respond to the numerous 911 calls.&nbsp; Clearly, the victim, her friend, the woman with the phone, and the abusive man knew each other.&nbsp; I was seeing it for the first time, and it was shocking.&nbsp; <br /><br />This man should not be on the street.&nbsp; Certainly not in that condition.&nbsp; As I said in my original post, I don&#039;t know if he was mentally ill, drugged out or both.&nbsp; If he is mentally ill, the police should have brought him to emergency psychiatric care at Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; And if this happens on a regular basis, he needs serious long-term help.&nbsp; The woman with the cane does not deserve to be beaten and abused, even if she is homeless, and even if the abuser is someone she knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot get these events out of my mind.&nbsp;

					Friday at 2:30 in the afternoon I saw a man assaulting a woman on 37th road across from the train station and the former Eagle Theater.&nbsp; The man was trying to grab her cane, and she was holding on while he whipped it left and right, dragging her body in one direction and then the other.&nbsp; She screamed for him to let go.&nbsp; He screamed obscenities that the filter on this forum would not allow.&nbsp; Both the assailant and the victim appeared homeless.&nbsp; Pedestrians walked by without raising their eyes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another woman, perhaps homeless as well, but much less destitute in appearance, shouted for the man to leave the woman alone.&nbsp; The man then lurched towards her, flailing his arms.&nbsp; She threatened to call the police, and then took out a cell phone and dialed 911, and described the incident.&nbsp; She assured the woman and her female companion that the police were on the way.&nbsp; The man walked away, but came back a few minutes later.&nbsp; He pushed the woman with the cane again, knocking her to her side.&nbsp; The woman with the phone screamed at him, and he lurched at her, arms flailing, pulling down his pants, and screaming that he was going to blow her brains out.&nbsp; She called the police again, and this time so did I.&nbsp; I approached the women at this point, and told them that I had called the police too, and that I would provide a report to the police of what had happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over the next half hour, nearly a dozen calls were put into 911.&nbsp; The operators often insisted that the police were â€œalready thereâ€ although they were not.&nbsp; And during that half hour, the man, who was either mentally ill, severely intoxicated, or both, went back and forth&nbsp; between terrorizing these women, pulling his pants down, pushing them, screaming threats and obscenities, and wandering off down the street, only to come back and start again.<br /><br />When the police finally arrived, I was already late for my 3 PM meeting in midtown.&nbsp; The woman with the phone and I waved at them, but by this point she was screaming hysterically, insisting that he had assaulted her too.&nbsp; The police asked her what she had done to cause the attack.&nbsp; I was stunned.&nbsp; The original victim sat quietly clutching her cane, smiling in a way that was inconsistent with the events going on around her.&nbsp; I tried to talk to the police, but the male office yelled at me, and told me to â€œstand over there!â€&nbsp; I tried to speak again, and he yelled â€œI said OVER THERE.â€<br /><br />I stood for a few minutes.&nbsp; Finally, I wrote my cell phone number on the back of a business card, gave it to the officer, and said I would be available to file a report after 5 PM when my meeting was over, but that I was very late.&nbsp; I stated again that the man had assaulted the women, and that he clearly needed mental health services, and I got ready to get on the train for my meeting.&nbsp; A man who works in my building had witnessed the end off the incident, and asked me what happened.&nbsp; I gave him a short summary, and he said â€œWell, you did your civic duty.â€&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I didnâ€™t feel as if I had done my â€œcivic duty.â€&nbsp; But I donâ€™t know what I could have done differently.&nbsp; Other than walking with my eyes averted, like most of the people on the street.&nbsp; <br />

					I think that the ranking of the criteria is rather odd.&nbsp; Transportation is 42 out of 50?&nbsp; Honestly, with the E,F,R,G,V and 7, along with a strong network of buses that can take you easily to midtown, the airport, the Rockaway beaches, I have trouble imagining any outer boro communities with better transportation.&nbsp; <br /><br />And what is &quot;creative capital?&quot;&nbsp; We scored last place in that category. Guess there is no art, music, dance..... no street musicians, no free concerts in the park or on 37th road.&nbsp; No art exhibits or poetry readings. Restaruants/cafes with live music don&#039;t count, I guess.&nbsp; Drag shows, certainly not.&nbsp; &nbsp;And parades are clearly low-culture, not high culture.&nbsp; &nbsp;No culture out here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Restaurants?&nbsp; 32 out of 50?&nbsp; You&#039;re kidding.&nbsp;

					It is MUCH easier to do through the mail if you are eligible.&nbsp; Last time I had to go in person, because I was getting a passport for a minor child, and I was required to physically present identification and whatnot.<br /><br />Rather than waiting in the ridiculously long lines here in JH, I actually went to a Manhattan post office.&nbsp; Even though there was still a wait, it was not as bad, and there were places to sit.&nbsp;

					I look forward to having the opportunity to vote for Bryan.&nbsp; He is a smart guy, a hard worker, and he is someone who really cares about the issues facing immigrant communities, low income families, and anyone who is getting a raw deal.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t need to invent a platform, like some new politicians do.&nbsp; The work that he has been putting energy into for years will become his platform.&nbsp;

					Something about that corner.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember the Islamic Thinkers.&nbsp; I liked their name the first time I saw them, and went over to see what they were about.&nbsp; Ooops.&nbsp; I originally approached a man, and he backed away and directed a woman to answer my questions and move me along.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard more than a few people speculate that they were actually undercover homeland security types hoping to find fanatisism within the local Muslim communities.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; Not a nice bunch of folks in either case.&nbsp; <br /><br />Watched the aproned prayer people a few days ago. They did look sort of sad and defeated.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s been a couple of years since the white Hari Krishnas danced and chanted for bewildered 74th Street shoppers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But my favorite Jackson Heights &quot;offensive religious incident&quot; is this youtube video.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqIa1JgG3qc" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqIa1JgG3qc</a>&nbsp; Vintage 2007.&nbsp; <br /><br />It actually contains great neighborhood footage, though sadly a low quality video.&nbsp; Every time I watch it I see more neighborhood faces that I know.&nbsp;

					Well that was a few day&#039;s worth of high drama.&nbsp; <br /><br />So.&nbsp; Can anyone explain the mechanics of this special election?&nbsp; <br /><br />Assuming Peralta gets elected, do we then have a special special election and put Bryan Pu Folkes in his seat?&nbsp; And what would the timeframe be for that?&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a really difficult year for the State, with enormous deficits and&nbsp; painful cuts on the horizon that will effect all New Yorkers.&nbsp; At a time in which Upstate legislators would love to dump a disproportunate part of the fiscal problems on NYC, I&#039;m concerned about any voids in representation during this crucial State budget season.&nbsp;

					How very sad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve watched that theater cater to the needs of two very different communities over the past two decades.&nbsp; I&#039;d only been inside once, but I know for many many community residents, it was an important place.&nbsp; I remember when they would call in the 115 and the 110 to hover outside when an important cricket match was taking place and being shown live at the Eagle.&nbsp; Just in case there was any rioting.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; <br /><br />Another generic storefront?&nbsp; &nbsp;Tragic.&nbsp;

					I think the Colonials are the most attractive walk ups in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; (Most people think the Greystones are, but I disagree).&nbsp; The units are gracious and sunny, and I really like the layouts.&nbsp; The Colonials are actually a series of buildings, each with 10 units, I think.&nbsp; I am pretty sure that each building is in charge of its own management, so it is a very different situation from the big buildings.&nbsp; A few years ago i was in an apartment that had a washer/dryer in the unit, which is very rare in JH.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if there are different policies in different buildings.&nbsp; Safe?&nbsp; I live on the same block and I have always felt very safe here.&nbsp; Used to live 3 blocks away, and I felt very safe there too.&nbsp;

					Sorry to be responding so late to this post.&nbsp; <br /><br />I live and work in JH, but I often have morning meetings downtown.&nbsp; I love getting on the 7 train at 82nd street, standing one stop, and getting a seat when everyone gets off at 74th.&nbsp; I turn on my ipod, pull out a book, and enjoy the ride.&nbsp; I then change to the 4/5 downtown, and generally stand.&nbsp; So the 7 from 74th onward is the BEST part of the commute.&nbsp;
