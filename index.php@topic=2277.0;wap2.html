			The Daily News has a slide show of photos taken during a recent, but brief roll-out of the MTA&#039;s vintage subway cars, wicker seats and all.&nbsp; Anyone remember those cars?&nbsp; I always thought they resembled battleships or submarines.&nbsp; The slide show includes some background conversation from actual riders.&nbsp; Upon spotting the ceiling fans in the car, one rider exclaims how charming they are, and how back then people seemed to focus more on comfort.&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; All I remember is a fan blowing hot hair in my face and getting splinters from the wicker seats.&nbsp; &nbsp;:2funny:&nbsp; Far from charming!<br /><br />Daily News -- Subway Nostalgia<br />
