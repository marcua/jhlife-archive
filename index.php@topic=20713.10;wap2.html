			Things are just not so formal in a small coop--it would be weird if they were the same as in a large building. We&#039;re just a small group of neighbors and we communicate with each other our plans. The &quot;supervision&quot; is more informal, but there is no reason to assume that informal means negligent and people should be frightened off from small coop ownership because it seems scary and unregulated or something. Our longtime president tells people what to watch out for, that certain things should be replaced during a renovation, but we don&#039;t have forms and fees and formal reviews.

			Does anyone that had to deal with DOB have experiences to share? <br /><br />I am looking to hear from people that had to go through condo/coop renovations on things like knocking down non-bearing walls, changing from a bathtub to a shower, and updating electrical and were asked by the management company to file those permits with DOB. <br /><br />How was the process? How long did it take? Any anecdotes could be helpful.<br /><br />I am posting this one here again since I think the topics could be related to this topic as well. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />DD

			Our contractor did all the filing during our renovation. We didn&#039;t have anything to do with any of it.
