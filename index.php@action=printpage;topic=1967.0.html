				<strong>Coquito, OMG.&nbsp; Years ago we used to have a coquito contest.&nbsp; There would be about 12 - 15 of us getting <br />together in Throgs Neck at a friends place.&nbsp; You name it they were there...politicos, friends, business people<br />and they were all there for the junk.&nbsp; That&#039;s right Coquito!<br /><br />We had a hell of a party and the following week my friend Gerson would have the annual &quot;pasteles Making <br />gathering&quot;.&nbsp; In the coquito contest it was just as it sounded.&nbsp; People would have to make it home and bring it<br />ready for drinking.&nbsp; As you can imagine by the end of the &quot;contest&quot; no one was in shape to judge anything <br />thus I got cheated out of my place in coquito history...LOL.&nbsp; On the &quot;fiesta de los pasteles&quot; <br />(pastels making gathering) a dozen or so of us got together and basically made pasteles.&nbsp; My friend had all the <br />ingredients and everyone brought their own poison (BYOB) + extra for the Host of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone would peel the Yuatias, another the guineos, calabaza and and that good stuff.&nbsp; Someone else would cube<br />the pork butt and others would make the sofrito, recaito and prep the onions, peppers and whatever else we <br />would shove into the masa.&nbsp; It was like an orgy of drunks trying to tie up pasteles in the Platano leaves.&nbsp; Oh yeah,<br />it got ugly...LOL&nbsp; GOOD TIMES....GOOD TIMES</strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">There is quite a few ways of making coquito and while I know how to make it some may find it can be too sweet and <br />not sweet enough for others.&nbsp; Then again if you are coquito virgin you&#039;ll love it...OH YEAH!!!<br /><br />Try this one since it is more traditional than the Newyorican one some of my frineds make....I think I&#039;m going to place it on the forum I started for Holiday recipes, but I think I&#039;ll make a batch tomorrow.&nbsp; :D<br /></span><div align="center"><strong><br /><br />(http://www.spanishtown.ca/Images/coquito.jpg)<br />1/2 cup water <br />1/3 teaspoon ground cloves <br />3 egg yolks<br />1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br />1 teaspoon vanilla extract (imitation is fine)<br />1&nbsp; can evaporated milk<br />1 can of Coco Lopez cream of coconut <br />1 can of condensed milk (the sweet, thick one)<br />1 1/2 cups Don Q rum (if you can&#039;t get Don Q Gold you can use Bacardi Gold or Black)</strong></div>OK, now for the real work<br /><br /><em><strong>You can use white rum if you wish instead of the Gold...I like the gold.&nbsp; If you want to cut down on the eggs you can as well, I just like it rich.&nbsp; You should use a double boiler if you have it otherwise be careful not to burn it.&nbsp; Combine the egg yolks and evaporated milk.&nbsp; Bring to a boil and then lower the temperature to low and stir regularly.&nbsp; Once the mixture becomes thicker (it should coat the spoon) take it off the range.&nbsp; You should allow the mixture to cool off for 10 or 15 minutes.&nbsp; Now take your blender and add the rest of the ingredients including your cooled off mixture.&nbsp; Put it in the fridge a few hours and serve cold.&nbsp; Once you taste it you can play with the cinammon and vanilla until you get to the point you want.&nbsp; You can leave it out and simply pour it over ice if you preffer it that way.&nbsp; If you can handle it a bit harder just add some rum to it...that&#039;s what I do&nbsp; but if you want a lighter one you can use 1 cup of rum instead :buck2:</strong></em>

				&nbsp;<strong>Hey, don&#039;t mess with perfection Lady!...LOL<br /><br />Some of my friends don&#039;t use any eggs at all.&nbsp; I learned to make coquito with the eggs so I was conditioned to do so.&nbsp; I think the eggs add a bit more richness but I had it without it and they taste great as well.&nbsp; Make sure you add the rum 1/2 cup 1st than keep adding until you reach a point you are comfortable with.&nbsp; Some may find the 1 1/2 cup a bit powerful so use caution... :D<br /><br />There is a diabetic version I make for my dad...it&#039;s not too bad actually.&nbsp; I take a coconut and skim milk and put it through the blender until it&#039;s super shredded.&nbsp; Then I boil it with cloves in medium/low for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Once it&#039;s cooler I drain and squeeze the coconut.&nbsp; Finally I add the vanilla, cinnamon and packets of splenda until it&#039;s sufficiently sweet.&nbsp; My dad doesn&#039;t &quot;really&quot; drink anymore so we hit it with a splash of rum per serving.

				This is not a traditional holiday recipe, but I made it for last year&#039;s Christmas dinner and my family requested it again this year...<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Moroccan Roasted Carrot Salad</strong></span><br /><br /><strong>for roasted carrots and dressing:</strong><br />3/4 lb medium carrots, peeled and quartered lengthwise<br />1 red onion peeled and slivered into eighths<br />1/4 cup and 1 tbs olive oil<br />1 and 1/4 tsp salt<br />2 tbs sugar<br />2 tbs fresh lemon juice<br />1 tbs fresh grated lemon zest<br />2 tsp paprika<br />1 tsp ground cumin<br />1/2 tsp cinnamon<br />1/4 tsp cayenne<br /><br /><strong>For couscous</strong><br />2 and 3/4 cups water<br />2 and 1/4 cups Israeli or Pearl couscous<br />1 tbs olive oil<br />2 tsp salt<br /><br /><strong>Additions</strong><br />1/2 cup kalamata olives, pitted and chopped<br />1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br />1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley<br />1/2 cup crumbled feta (optional)<br /><br /><strong>1. Make carrots and dressing</strong><br />Preheat oven to 425 degrees.&nbsp; <br />To roast carrots, place the carrots, onion, 1 tbs olive oil, 1/4 tsp of the sale and the pepper on a baking sheet.&nbsp; Toss well and transfer to oven. Roast carrots, shaking occasionally, until they just begin to caramelize around the edges (about 30 minutes).&nbsp; Carrots should be firm not mushy.<br /><br />Meanwhile, make the dressing in a bowl by whisking together the sugar, lemon juice, rest of oil, spices and remaining salt unti sugar is dissolved. When the roasted carrots are cool enough to handle, cut them into angled 1-inch slices and toss them well with dressing.&nbsp; Cover and marinate the carrots chilled for at least 4 hours.<br /><br />2<strong>. Make couscous and assemble salad:</strong><br />Bring water, salt and olive oil to boil in a heavy saucepan and stir in couscous, then reduce to simmer, uncovered, for 6 minutes. Cover pan and remove from heat. Let stand 10 minutes. Spread couscous in 1 layer on baking sheet and cool 15 minutes.<br />Transfer couscous to a bowl and stir in carrot mixture, the additions and salt and pepper to taste.&nbsp; Serve warm or at room temperature.

				Thanksgiving 2009 is over... let&#039;s move on to more holiday recipes!<br /><br />I made the Moroccan carrot couscous for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit.&nbsp; You can find the large-sized couscous at Trade Fair in the aisle next to the produce aisle, and across from the Halal meats-- just look way up (top shelf) for a red box.&nbsp; There&#039;s another brand in a different color box too, but I always get the red one.<br /><br />

				Here&#039;s a really nice applesauce recipe.&nbsp; I always leave out the sugar.&nbsp; It&#039;s from http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/applesauce/<br /><br /><strong>Applesauce</strong><br />Preparation time: 45 minutes. The sugar amounts are just guidelines, depending your taste, and on the sweetness of your apples, use less or more. If you use less sugar, you&#039;ll likely want to use less lemon juice. The lemon juice brightens the flavor of the apples and balances the sweetness.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />â€¢3 to 4 lbs of peeled, cored, and quartered apples. (Make sure you use a good cooking apple like Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Jonathan, Mcintosh, or Gravenstein.)<br />â€¢4 strips of lemon peel - use a vegetable peeler to strip 4 lengths<br />â€¢Juice of one lemon, about 3-4 Tbsp<br />â€¢3 inches of cinnamon stick<br />â€¢1/4 cup of dark brown sugar * (optional)<br />â€¢up to 1/4 cup of white sugar * (optional)<br />â€¢1 cup of water<br />â€¢1/2 teaspoon of salt<br /><br />Method<br />1 Put all ingredients into a large pot. Cover. Bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes.<br /><br />2 Remove from heat. Remove cinnamon sticks and lemon peels. Mash with potato masher. <br /><br />Ready to serve, either hot or refrigerated. Delicious with vanilla ice cream or vanilla yogurt.<br /><br />Freezes easily, lasts up to one year in a cold freezer. <br />

				Well, not really a Holiday recipe but my grandma and aunt would make it somewhat more special during the holidays when people would come over. &nbsp;You could actually see the chicken parts instead of mini chunks--hehe. &nbsp;She would usually do it with guandules instead of the sweet peas and she added the raisins as well.<div align="center"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Fricase de Pollo</strong></span></div><br /><div align="center">(http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Comida_Criolla/pollo_guisado-600x450.jpg)</div><br />Olive Oil - 3 tablespoons <br />Whole Chicken - cut into normal size as if you were frying it but take excess skin off<br />Onion, chop it up anyway you like -- 1 medium or large <br />Italian or Bell pepper, chop it same as the onion<br />Garlic, minced -- 5 cloves <br />Smoked Ham (you can skip it if you don&#039;t do swine), diced about 2/3 of a cup of less <br />Cilantro, rough chopped -- about 1/2 bunch <br />Oregano - about a tablespoon <br />Stock - 1 cup<br />White Wine 1 1/2 cup (my aunt would add a can of schaeffer beer)<br />Tomato sauce -- 1/2 cup <br />Red wine vinegar -- 1 tablespoon <br />Green pimento-stuffed olives -- 10-15 <br />Raisins - 2 tablespoons (she added this on her holiday version..hehe)<br />Bay leaves - 2 or 3 <br />Salt and pepper - this one is hard since I never measure - use your judgement and to taste <br />Peas -1 small can <br />1 large potato, (cut into 1-inch cubes) <br />1 teaspoon capers &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><em><strong>Heat the oil in a large pot over high heat. Once you see it is very hot lower it to a medium - hot and add half a teaspoon of sugar (for color) until it becomes caramelized or dark brown. &nbsp;(You can skip the sugar browning and use achiote instead) Add the chicken and allow it a a couple of minutes per side until it browns nicely then remove to a plate. <br />Add the onion, pepper and garlic and saute over medium heat until the onions are soft. Then add the ham, cilantro and oregano and saute for another 3 minutes or so. &nbsp;Stir in the remaining ingredients except for the peas and return the browned chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes then check to make sure the chicken is tender. &nbsp;If you need more time allow it 10 more minutes or so <br /><br />Add the peas and simmer for another 5 minutes. &nbsp; Turn off the range and allow to rest for about 5 minutes. &nbsp;Serve over white or yellow rice</strong></em>

				<strong><br />I think Im going to try that one Shelby....Looks really yummy!</strong><br /><br />I&#039;m flying tomorrow afternoon to PR, I have a wedding to attend to on Saturday. &nbsp;I&#039;ll ask one of my Tias to give me a recipe or two (or 4) of dishes my grandma made. &nbsp;Grandma (mom&#039;s side) was the original &quot;fusion&quot; cook (arent grandma&#039;s the most capables cooks) as far as I&#039;m concern. &nbsp;Her French and Spaniard &nbsp;(and whatever other hell holes the great grandparents lived and mixed up with along the way in the 1600&#039; - 1800&#039;s) heritage fused to make some memorable cooking when we were growing up. &nbsp;Abuela used whatever was available to make some amazing dishes that, unfortunately I have never found outside of our Pueblito and other small towns. &nbsp;<br /><br />She would make soups / caldos with corn flour and bacalao, unique stews with Fabas &amp; garbanzos and one way or another managed to slip in Yautia lila and other root veggies, old hen, guineas, duck and rabbit on a regular basis to an army of ungrateful grandkids. &nbsp;When we came back to NYC, the only PR food we saw being cooked locally was basically cuchifritos, rice &amp; beans (usually pink, red, black or pigeon) and stews.&nbsp; Dishes like surullitos con queso, Panapen, piononitos, guanimes, bacalao a la vizcaina, arroz con calamares en su tinta, Arroz con cangrejo and pescados en escabeche may not ring a bell to many Nuyoricans but to many of us that grew up (at least for my pre teen years) this was the Abuela dishes that we remember growing up. <br /><br />IM HUNGRY!!!
