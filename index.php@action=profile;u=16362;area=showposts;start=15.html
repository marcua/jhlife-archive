					Not in the neighborhood, but if you&#039;d make the trip to lower Manhattan, Greenwich Jewelers on Trinity Place does a wonderful job with resizing. I found that when I was looking for a place that does resizing about 5 years ago, most places sent the ring off site, and needed to hang onto it for about a week to complete the service. Greenwich does everything on site, and if you make an appointment, it takes them no more than an hour. It&#039;s also a small family operation - dad and business partner are the jewelers that do the work in the back, and his two adult daughters handle sales in front. Lovely people.

					Most of restaurant profits are driven by alcohol sales, so it makes sense that if they&#039;re a dry restaurant they have to price their menu a little higher to cover expenses. We&#039;ve eaten there once, and enjoyed it very much, and the people that work there are lovely, we just don&#039;t eat out very much. But well worth a visit for some excellent food and hospitality.

					I go to a place in Sunnyside, Tommy&#039;s Dry Cleaning on Skillman and 46th. It&#039;s a bit of a hike, but I find the quality of his work is worth the trip, everything is done in house, and Tommy is always there, so you&#039;re getting an accurate estimate and time frame on the spot instead of leaving your garment and waiting for a call.

					As outrageous as this all seems, and as bad as I feel for the workers and their families, this is actually pretty standard practice across retail. The thinking behind it is that if workers are notified in advance that they will be losing their jobs, they will loot the store for goods and cash before departing. It is crappy that they were given no severance and/or a deal was not worked out with the new owner to keep them on, but the lack of notification is a reality of the industry.

					I find pigeons and their poop (and, by extension, any human who feeds pigeons) all repulsive, I just don&#039;t know that there&#039;s much to say beyond that. The solution to the problem is to round up the pigeons and dispose of them, but I don&#039;t think anyone would really publicly endorse those measures, and have fun getting paint-bombed by PETA if you do. You could scrub the sidewalk under the 7 train three times a day, every day, and it would still be covered in bird crap. The fact is, the birds are plentiful, that&#039;s where they hang out, and they crap a lot.<br /><br />I live in Washington Plaza, and there&#039;s one tree next to the lower fountain that the birds love. The maintenance team sprays down the walkways every day, but sure as sh--, every morning there are piles of it right under that tree. Under the 7 train is that times a million.<br /><br />I read a book a long time ago, White Teeth by Zadie Smith. There was one character who was so frustrated with birds crapping all over his awning that he would kill the birds with his meat cleaver (he was a butcher). His mantra was, &quot;The sh-- is not the sh--. The pigeon is the sh--.&quot; It wasn&#039;t a great book, but I always remembered his mantra.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s not that people aren&#039;t in agreement with you, I&#039;d guess that many are. I just don&#039;t think there&#039;s much that can be done aside from crossing Roosevelt as little as possible, and at other locations (there tends to be more crap under the stations than in between them) when it&#039;s absolutely necessary. And publicly shaming people who feed the birds.

					It&#039;s not uncommon for the owner of a business to withhold closure information from their staff for as long as possible, the thinking being that those that are aware of their impending unemployment will start looting. So, I wouldn&#039;t doubt that the lease deal is signed by Blink simply because the staff of the existing gym is unaware. Or was unaware, as they have now been tipped off.<br /><br />Build-out for a gym would take no more than 14 weeks, could be weeks faster if it is just cosmetic (i.e. if showers and toilets are remaining in place, but locker rooms are receiving new tile and a fresh coat of paint).

					If you click on the DNAinfo link and see the picture, those of you who are Farmspot members may recognize Chef Sanhi from this season&#039;s Thursday night distributions. She has been there every week selling a selection of her pastries, and every one I&#039;ve tried (and I&#039;ve tried a lot) has been delicious. She is a truly talented pastry chef, and I&#039;d love to see her succeed with a shop in Jackson Heights. And if you haven&#039;t tried her pastries yet, you&#039;re missing out!

					I&#039;m kind of in agreement with the folks that are saying that we, as a neighborhood, wouldn&#039;t quite be able to support a bistro, and throwing Starbucks into the conversation is comparing apples and oranges. As someone said in a previous post, Starbucks is a place that people will go to and read, work, stay a while; a brunch place or bistro wouldn&#039;t allow that, and would require a packed house and fast turn-over every night and weekend in order to make rent, let alone profit. Juju&#039;s, and even Alchemy, are the more apt comparisons for the kind of business a bistro would drum up, and these places aren&#039;t exactly bursting at the seams with patrons; luckily for them, they&#039;re not paying 37 Ave rents, and seem to be making do. <br /><br />If you&#039;re longing for some different options/American food, I encourage you to try a burger at Cassidy&#039;s up on 31st Ave. It&#039;s a bit of a walk, but the burger is solid, and the regulars, while usually over-served, are friendly and entertaining. And if you want a Starbucks alternative, but would like to stay put longer than the E77 time limit, venture up to Coffeed on Northern Blvd. It&#039;s a couple miles (a good walk in this lovely fall weather we&#039;ve been having), or a few stops on the Q66 bus or M/R (to 36). The coffee is fantastic, the food is good, and you can linger as long as you like. Oh, and the Brooklyn Grange farm is on the roof of the building, so you can go up and check that out too! It&#039;s pretty awesome.<br /><br />

					I&#039;ve done a little bit of research on Starbucks&#039;s leasing practices because, honestly, I found it hard to believe that a Landlord would give them this kind of power. As it turns out, they are being sued in a class-action suit in Seattle for this and other practices they utilize to wipe out competition. You can read about it here:<br /><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starbucks-accused-of-abusing-monopoly-power-in-violation-of-sherman-act-57142892.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starbucks-accused-of-abusing-monopoly-power-in-violation-of-sherman-act-57142892.html</a><br /><br />They have also fallen victim to the same practices used by McDonald&#039;s, which, for all we know, is where they got the idea. See details here:<br /><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-04-22/news/0604220176_1_lease-retailers-mcdonald" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-04-22/news/0604220176_1_lease-retailers-mcdonald</a><br /><br />So, after all that, it is certainly plausible that they have a lease that restricts competition, and that competition is very broadly defined in their lease. Such a bummer for our neighborhood.<br /><br />One final note (and possibly glimmer of hope)... I also did some digging around public records of some city agencies (Buildings and Finance, to be exact), and it appears that while this particular landlord owns this particular block, they don&#039;t appear to be affiliated with any other property in the area. That&#039;s not to say they&#039;re not operating under multiple names, but I would think that Starbucks&#039;s stranglehold is limited to buildings with the same lease ownership as their own, and is therefore limited to their current block. Here&#039;s to hoping, anyway.

					I do worry a little about the gentrification effect though. On the one hand, this is an established neighborhood that is largely owner-occupied. Gentrification tends to begin with rental prices and then spill over to selling prices, but Jackson Heights lacks and abundance of rentals (for a neighborhood so dense, anyway), and is therefore missing a somewhat critical stepping stone. The lack of certain amenities (a gym, for example) and retail diversity could further stall gentrification, maybe even squash it all together.<br /><br />On the other hand, depending on how much press the neighborhood gets between her blog, brownstoner, and any other outlets that might jump on the bandwagon, there&#039;s potential for some opportunistic owners to put up a listing with a way-too-high asking price and see if they get any nibbles. And if they do, that might just set the tone for the next few years of real estate in Jackson Heights. And in that case, yes, people will be priced out of the neighborhood, specifically renters looking to buy and owners looking to upgrade. I&#039;m in the former category, and my husband and I are hoping to buy two years from now. And right now I&#039;m a little nervous.

					I don&#039;t think that&#039;s how right of first refusal works... Typically, when that is built into a contract, the owner is required to offer the lease proposal of the vacant space to the rights holder (in this case, Starbucks) prior to offering it to any other potential tenant; if Starbucks refuses the space, the landlord can do business with whomever he/she wants. Starbucks would not have a say unless they rented the space themselves.<br /><br />They may have some co-tenancy/adjacency restrictions built into their lease, but having that kind of control worked into a lease is almost unheard of, and typically would need to be very specific (e.g. Dunkin Donuts, Panera Bread shall not be within 1/4 mile of premises).
