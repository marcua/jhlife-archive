				Yes, good idea! The new building on 83rd and Roosevelt has a large space that is often (somewhat randomly) used as a wholesale clothes bazaar. It is really quite awful, total dump. I haven&#039;t been in but it does appear large. <br /><br />There are also a few empty spots between 84th and 85th on 37th. I wonder if they could be conjoined. <br /><br />

				For comparison&#039;s sake, the Sunnyside NYSC is 15,000 sq feet. &nbsp;This gym feels really small to me, but of course when you account for sq footage, you have to remember all the locker rooms, office space, recepton area, etc. that take up space.<br /><br />I would love to have ANY good gym in the neighborhood. &nbsp;I have never been to a Planet Fitness but if it&#039;s a nice one, I&#039;ll take it and switch from NYSC.

				Ditto on any decent gym coming to the area.&nbsp; I&#039;m new here and I&#039;m amazed at the sheer lack of options to get myself in shape.&nbsp; No parks, no tracks, no gyms.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gained 20lbs I think, just because there&#039;s nowhere to go.&nbsp; I joined Zumba at a local studio and it&#039;s only offered once a week and never has more than 2-3 people taking it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken pilates at Mimi&#039;s but the instructor I liked left.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m taking kickboxing at I Love Kickboxing.&nbsp; There was&nbsp; a Groupon and out of desperation I bought it.&nbsp; Have to say it&#039;s the best thing I could have done.&nbsp; The workouts are awesome.&nbsp; The only bad thing is that taking classes at studios like this makes working out expensive.&nbsp; So when the groupon runs out, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll be able to afford it.&nbsp; Joining a gym is usually much cheaper and you get the classes for free.

				The lack of a decent gym in Jackson Heights is the biggest sticking point I have with the neighborhood (I&#039;m thinking about moving there). If the gym is more than a 15 minute walk (let alone a subway ride...! or a place you have to drive to...!) odds are pretty high you&#039;re going to skip a lot of workouts when it&#039;s raining, or snow is on the ground. JH is absolutely under-served in that department. If you look up gyms/do a search on Google maps, you can see a vast area of Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst that has no options at all. A gym on Northern Blvd would probably clean up (would need research to confirm demographics, but there is only Curves on Northern Blvd, and a small gym/karate studio near the BQE.<br /><br />In my opinion, a NY Sports Club with a pool, etc, isn&#039;t necessary (huge investment up front). A bare-bones gym with plenty of space and new equipment would do well, be less expensive to open (and less expensive to join). Northern Blvd. seems like an obvious place where that could happen. The Executive Fitness gym is far enough away that they could co-exist. People want a gym that they can easily walk to, and the area around Northern Blvd is ripe for picking.<br /><br />There are great gyms in Woodside, Astoria, and Flushing. Rego Park and Forest Hills have chains like Ballys. I don&#039;t see why Jackson Heights is so lacking in this regard.

				The only gym I&#039;ve seen is the one on 78th and Roosevelt (I believe), but it&#039;s so sketchy. We definitely need a big name gym in the area, like a bally&#039;s, NYSC or a Planet Fitness. Forest Hills has like 4 in a 2 block radius on Austin Street! Northern blvd would be ideal... how do we go about this?

				Resurrecting this thread to add information relating to a new development on the Planet Fitness front.&nbsp; According to a recent blog entry from the <strong>Jackson Heights Post</strong>, Planet Fitness has filed for permits with the Department of Buildings to bring the gym to Jackson Heights, specifically Roosevelt Avenue, between 86th and 87th Streets.&nbsp; The article states that Community Board 3 was scheduled to address this matter yesterday, December 17th.&nbsp; Anyone have any more news on this?<br /><br />Planet Fitness files plans to open on Roosevelt Ave/86th Street (http://jacksonheightspost.com/planet-fitness-files-plans-to-open-on-roosevelt-ave86th-street/)<br />

				If that location doesn&#039;t work out. 75-22 Broadway and near Roosevelt train station seems to be vacant. The restaurant and the micropower career Institute seems to be gone. According to my Google search micropower Institute got into some legal trouble. Not sure if that video store next to restaurant and underneath micropower Institute shown in Google maps is still there since it is not an updated photo of 75th street Broadway. Someone should seriously suggest that place if it fulfills the requirement.

				The location reported by the Jackson Heights Post seems to be undergoing renovation. There was a crew on 86th St. near Roosevelt with dumpsters doing demo the other day, I think it was for that location. There&#039;s also brown paper up on two of the store fronts (the third is covered by metal gate) so I&#039;m guessing this is a real thing. It&#039;s right across the street from Executive Fitness too. <br /><br />I wonder how long it will be until a full service gym that offers group fitness classes and conveniences like towel service, soap, hair dryers, etc. will make it&#039;s way to JH?

				NYSC&#039;s parent company, Town Sports, was looking to sell NYSC in March. Not sure if that&#039;s still the case, but the company isn&#039;t doing well. They over expanded. <br /><br />I actually think the most likely gym to court is Crunch, but my guess is the Crunch gyms in the outerboroughs are franchises. The gym business is one with two models: super cheap like Planet Fitness, Executive Fitness, or Blink; or nice high end gyms. Honestly, I think there are enough people in this neighborhood that would be happy to work out at some place with towel service, classes, etc. and pay more than $15/month. Crunch Essentials I think are smaller and less high end than a corporate Crunch (I went to the one on 34th St. with a friend, and it was amaze-balls nice. And I used to be a Crunch member years ago.), but the one in Richmond Hill offers month-to-month rates at $26 on the high end, and the photos on Yelp look decent.

				And just take a look at this at this group fitness schedule from the Richmond Hill Crunch.

				Is Planet Fitness better than Blink? They seem the same-ish.<br /><br />I&#039;d happily pay more for a NYSC. Crunch would be even better!<br /><br />What&#039;s with that ginormous building Chipoltle is in? On Northern and like 90th St.?&nbsp; It&#039;s totally empty. With a fenced rooftop.

				I think Planet Fitness and Blink are about the same. There&#039;s been instances where Planet Fitness&#039;s &quot;no gym-timidation&quot; policies have been taken to ridiculous extremes by club managers - women getting grief for wearing only a sports bra on top at the gym, people getting grief for wearing a bandanna at the gym. The benefit for the consumer is that some of the overcrowding at Blink could be alleviated. People who live closer to 75th St. can stay there, and any members closer to 86th St. can go to Planet Fitness. <br /><br />I&#039;d note also that Executive Fitness is comparably priced and though smaller, that location for the gym is relatively new and the gym is in good shape. They have a fitness room which is a good spot to do yoga/mat pilates/stretching, is a secondary weight area and is good for running your own cardio/weight training circuit. I wish they&#039;d use that space for group fitness classes.

				If you take a look at Astoria, you&#039;ll find a significant amount of independent&nbsp; or lesser known gyms.&nbsp; Club Fitness, The Matrix, Life Health Fitness, The Rock, Astoria Health Complex, in addition to the chains: Planet Fitness, Blink, Lucielle Roberts, NYSC, and probably more I&#039;ve missed.&nbsp; I see no reason we can&#039;t support this.&nbsp; I joined Blink but quit due to the crowding.&nbsp; I just pay for zumba classes in the neighborhood now, which we do have plenty of.&nbsp; But I would love to join a gym nearby that had both classes and equipment, that was clean, and not so crowded.&nbsp; I do believe we have people to support it.&nbsp;

				Yes, $10 per month with a $39 annual fee, plus a registration fee -- right now $1 but probably more when it opens.&nbsp; Plus you need to have the fees come out of either a checking account or put on a credit card.<br /><br />

				Check to see what the cancellation policy is. I was at Blink for a couple months, but the over crowding was just too much, so I found another gym closer to where I live. Blink just required a six week notice.<br /><br />Also watch for any additional fees -- twice a year blink charged a maintenance fee, so you had to take that in to account looking at your yearly cost. Many insurance plans will also reimburse for gym fees (at least partially) if you go a certain number of times in a given period.

				I don&#039;t trust any gym as far as their business practices.&nbsp; I have heard far too many stories of gyms continuing to charge people&#039;s accounts after they give proper notice and quit.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, that said, I am actually kind of happy to hear the news about the checking account since it means that perhaps the overcrowding won&#039;t be as severe as at Blink.&nbsp; I refused to even consider joining Blink after visiting at 2pm on a weekday and finding it extremely crowded.&nbsp; I figured if it was that crowded at what should have been a very off-peak hour, that it would be totally miserable at the regular peak hours.

				I think Blink might not be bad on off peak hours if you&#039;re there to mostly use the treadmills or elliptical machines. <br /><br />I do free weights and run through my own HIIT workouts, which requires some floor space, and found that area at Blink to just be inadequate even during off-peak hours. I also found the gym etiquette to be wanting in some of the patrons. Guys were parking themselves in some of the weight machines and when you ask to work a set in, respond they only have one more set to go. And then proceed to keep their asses in the weight machine for another five minutes. Allowing folks to work in a set on a weight machine is basic gym etiquette but does not insist their members adhere to such basic standards. (I know. I tried to get staff and the manager to do something, and they wouldn&#039;t.)<br /><br />I popped in at Planet Fitness because I&#039;d like to see if their cardio machines are going to include Spin bikes and rowing machines&nbsp; -- treadmills and ellipticals get boring, and recumbent bikes are kind of pointless -- but they are still under construction.

				Because it was so cheap and is only one block from me I went ahead and joined Planet Fitness figuring it can&#039;t be worse than Blink, which actually raises my stress levels. On day #2 in business it was 100x better, but I suspect that&#039;s just because not everyone realizes it&#039;s open yet. I could actually use the weight machines, which I never can at Blink, though the downstairs area where they are located was fairly busy (and already male-dominated). The cardio equipment on the main floor was only about 10% occupied. I would say there is roughly the same amount of equipment and machines as at Blink but it seems like more because it’s spread over two floors. I have a feeling this easygoing atmosphere won&#039;t last long, as there was a line 20+ deep to sign-up around 4:30pm.

				I am a member of PF, although I signed up at the Hudson, NY branch so that I can go when I&#039;m upstate on weekends.&nbsp; Payment is only via checking account, although they take your credit card information should the checking account charge not go through.<br /><br />I have not gone to the JH location as of yet, but I&#039;ve been to other PF&#039;s.&nbsp; They&#039;re a mixed bag.&nbsp; The one in Hudson NY, being less crowded and huge, is amazing.&nbsp; Equipment is new, location spotless, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also been to Flushing and regretted it - old equipment, parts broken;&nbsp; locker room with old rusty lockers and filled with signs that you shouldn&#039;t keep valuables in the lockers;&nbsp; dirty bathroom.&nbsp; Just an FYI if you decide on the global membership.<br /><br />On the plus side, global membership includes free tanning and use of some hydromassage machines.
