				Thirty years ago, the JHBG first launched its Historic Jackson Heights Weekend highlighting our unique garden community.&nbsp; And over the decades people have come from far and wide (and, of course, close to home) to attend the exhibit of original photographs and ephemera, a slide presentation, the garden tour and the walking tour.&nbsp; Attendance has grown to a total of over 300 for all events over the last few years.<br /><br />Sadly, the pandemic forced the cancellation of the June 2020 and June 2021 events. However, we are preparing for a “slimmed down” version this September (only the Garden and Walking Tours). We invite you to join us.&nbsp; Tickets are $10 for each tour.<br /><br />Garden Tour: September 18th from Noon to 4pm (raindate: September 25th)<br />We anticipate 12 gardens participating this year.&nbsp; And since we have never had a fall garden tour, here is a chance to see what they look like as the summer comes to a close.&nbsp; Tickets can be purchased at Espresso 77 (35- 77th Street) beginning in early September.&nbsp; On the day of the event tickets can be purchased in front of Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets between 11am and 2pm.&nbsp; We hope to have some books and T-shirts also available for sale.<br /><br />Walking Tour: September 19th at Noon<br />Tours will meet at 11:45 in front of the Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets).&nbsp; We ask that you reserve in advance by calling 347-766-9129 so that enough guides are available to keep each tour group to under 20 people.<br /><br />POST THE FLYER IN YOUR BUILDING!&nbsp; THANK YOU.<br />
