You&#039;re happy about this? I saw it and practically shook with anger. Reason being, there is absolutely no way a shop that has a few mangos and stale bread can be paying the enormous rents that have sent other shops to the wayside. Do we need more mangos in JH?&nbsp; That is a pretty big sized property, and its not even a third full. <br /><br />Last week I had a wonderful conversation with the owner and sales guy at Cigi Bikes. He&#039;s been here 30 years, and I gladly pay an inflated prices to keep him here. The rents are astounding, and I was left wondering how anyone pays them on the likes of fruit, DVD&#039;s or cheap housewares... <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in renting a kitchen space in the neighborhood to do some baking...how I&#039;d love to see the San Andresito space turn into a rentable commercial kitchen for all the many talented bakers, and hungry neighbors here in JH...but my initial research proves pretty upsetting. $11, 000 for a space on Roosevelt??? Man alive!! <br /><br />I don&#039;t wish them well there, I wish that whatever it is they are doing to pay the rent is fully investigated and legally vetted. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />missmarty,<br /><br />Please do support the stores you like. Excessive competition leads to zero profits and zero quality. But on the other hand, these owners are hard working people who had worked for others for decades. They wanted to start their own business. Their families are here. So they will spend their earning here rather than sending it away. I will support them, particularly when NYC isn&#039;t a very friendly place for a small business, not to mention the landmarks laws here. First-time business owners will very likely make mistakes and end up paying the violations that they can not afford.<br /><br />The rent they are paying is way below $11k since that space had been vacant for nearly a year before they moved in. It&#039;s, for the most part, a game of supply and demand. There was once an opportunity for a restaurant to be built there. After careful research, the potential tenant moved on because of the landmark issues and health-related concern. Basically every landmark application takes about 3 weeks. If it is denied and a re-submission is required for whatever reasons, it takes another 3 weeks to get a reply. Also, there&#039;s a big apartment building across the street, it will be an art to properly place the exhaust vents. If the wind blows the exhaust air toward the apartment building, or the residents there &quot;feel&quot; that the air quality isn&#039;t as good as before, additional funds have to be reserved for the lawsuits. These additional start-up cost and ongoing cost have to be taken into consideration. Plus, I don&#039;t know if it will be the best idea to add a bakery store half block away from La Nueva.<br /><br />Again, the rent isn&#039;t even close to $10k but it will be interesting to see how well they will do. Wish them best of luck!

					It was on Sunday. I was in my store most of the time but I did not notice that many people outside until the police cars showed up and blocked the street. The crowd stayed on the other side of the street. My customers were not threaten by them at all. Apparently, the cops did not appreciate 700+ people in and outside a small restaurant. It could be avoided if it was an organized celebration but then again a proper permit may be needed and the local fire department may not allow that many people in the store. I&#039;m just glad that this did not lead to a more violent event.

					Another company named &quot;Atlantis Business Consulting&quot; was in the neighborhood selling energy supplies. The company representative explained that they selected a couple of the best energy providers on the ESCO list that had good reputations and provided lower rates than Con Edison or National Grid. The business model sounded legit but I refused to try it out. Then she asked politely if I could help her company out by giving permission to monitor my gas/electric accounts for a year.&nbsp; She believed that she was helping out everyone by fighting against Con Edison/National Grid that overcharged their customers. Again I refused to reveal my information on gas/electric bills. After she left, I visited a few nearby stores and found that one store manager signed up a release form with this lady. By signing this form, not only the manager agreed to let LibertyPower (one of ESCO) monitor his accounts for a year, but also agreed to switch the energy suppliers for a year. I suspect that this is the form that she tried to get my signature on. I don&#039;t know if this company has visited the residential buildings.

					According to DEP website, discolored water is drinkable... <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt="&#58;o" title="Shocked" class="smiley" /><br /><br />What is Discolored Water?<br />Discolored water is only an aesthetic problem, and is caused when changes in system pressure stir up sediment in the Cityâ€™s pipes. <br />Is It Safe To Drink?<br />Yes, discolored water is safe to drink, but residents who are experiencing discolored water coming from the faucet should let the sediment settle before drinking. <br />What Should I do?<br />Residents should not be alarmed, but are encouraged to report these conditions via the Cityâ€™s non-emergency help line at 3-1-1 so that DEP can identify and resolve any problems and efficiently restore the system to normal.

					I&#039;m sure we are not alone here.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> It has been a long time since I last met with one of these scammer. so here&#039;s the story.<br /><br />A few days ago, a lady came to my store and asked to take a look at the utility bills. She opened the conversation with &quot;I&#039;m with ESCO and I&#039;m here today to make sure the utility companies in this area are treating people alright. First I thought she was a researcher or inspector working for some kind of public service department. Whatever that was, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to show her the bills and let her finish her report/job. So I showed her the most recent bills. Then she moved to the next step saying that she could help me lock down the current rates so that I would benefit from the fixed rate when the bills became higher during summer time. I realized that most likely she was a scammer and wasting my time. (In order to change rates, I will need to switch the utility supplier. so she worked for a utility company other than national grid or con edison.) I had a computer right in front of me. I google searched &quot;ESCO scam&quot; and a few reports came up on the page. Then I told her that she was free to leave. During the entire conversation, she never mentioned that she was from &quot;JUST ENERGY&quot;. She left me a business card with &quot;JUST ENERGY&quot; on it.

					I also did not find Boris overly friendly but he was not rude, neither. Since he&#039;s not here any more, maybe give the store another try. The young guys seem pretty nice to me, however. They are hard workers as well as Ella who recently took over her husband&#039;s job. I stepped in the liquor store a couple of times each month.
