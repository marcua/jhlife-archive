Karla Otto, international public relations agency, is leading an initiative to bring it to New York City at 7pm tonight, using the hashtag #ClapBecauseWeCare.<br /><br />Karla Otto is asking people to give doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, grocery store workers, restaurant workers, truck drivers, sanitation workers, friends, neighbors and colleagues a two-minute round of applause for their essential work.<br /><br />If you need some inspiration, check out how it was done in London and Madrid:...”<br /><br />I can’t include the links to the videos, but it is pretty neat to hear the applause and not see any people. Would love to see it take off here too.

					I was in a rush so didn&#039;t have time to look closely, but it looks like Phayul is opening a new location (or just moving). I saw signs of it at a street level spot on 37th Road across from their current location. I&#039;m not sure if it will occupy the 74th Street part of the old Army &amp; Navy or if that place was split.<br /><br />Anyway, hopefully I didn&#039;t imagine it and maybe someone else already knows the details and can share here.

					I received this email today so I&#039;m posting it just in case.... If anyone is interested and able to help this little guy, PM me for the rescuer&#039;s contact info. &nbsp;He needs to be an only cat apparently.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bill is a special kitty who came upon years of hard luck. After living<br />briefly in a home until his owners moved, he was tossed outside and<br />abandoned to the elements, losing most of his hearing and his teeth! <br />Bill was fed inconsistently &amp; indifferently, no medical needs were ever<br />attended to. He lived through snow and rainstorms with only a cardboard box<br />and a plastic chair for shelter on a bad bad block full of abandoned kitties<br />and lots of children who aren&#039;t nice to cats.<br /><br />I heard about Bill from a friend who had moved to the block and realized how<br />he was suffering through the winter, saw how much he loved to be pet on the<br />head each time my friend passed by, found out this had been going on for<br />years and called me. When I rescued him from his cardboard box under the<br />plastic chair, he was egregiously undernourished, filthy, missing most of<br />his teeth, and almost entirely deaf (he can hear clapping hands).<br /><br />Bill is far more confident knowing he no longer has to worry about his next<br />meal, has a cozy place to sleep, sheltered from the weather and consistent<br />love. He now purrs at the drop of a hat, the second he curls up! With<br />regular petting and holding, he has begun to seek out affection<br />independently. He sleeps on the bed every night and up by foster mom&#039;s head<br />and will switch sides of the bed in the middle of the night if she turns<br />around in order to be closer to her, often putting a paw on her arm or leg<br />while sleeping to feel near. He also gets a little jealous of her laptop<br />when she uses it in bed (often) and will nuzzle on it, walk back and forth<br />on it, and curl up by it in between her and the laptop. In spite of his<br />sobering upbringing, he likes to play and is particularly fond of<br />string-like toys (something foster mom realized when she came home to the<br />roll of toilet paper pulled down and shredded up as if a kitten had just had<br />a blast with it). Lately Bill has taken to waiting for his foster mom right<br />behind the front door since he is deaf, that way he knows when she gets<br />home!<br /><br />Bill is losing his home because his foster mom is moving into a dorm that<br />doesnÂ¹t allow pets. I have cats and Bill needs to be in a home without other<br />cats. <br /><br />Bill doesn&#039;t demand much and really just needs a loving, sweet human who<br />loves to be loved by a sweet kitty. He doesnÂ¹t like other cats and really<br />just wants to be around you. You aren&#039;t even obliged to pet him a lot. He<br />mainly just wants you to be there when you can.<br /><br />Bill is now healthy, tested negative for fiv/leuk, is neutered, and is<br />up-to-date on all of his shots.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------

					Hi,<br /><br />I have an aloe plant, well actually it looks like it has grown to about a dozen of them, that needs to be separated and re-potted.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is anything special I need to do to separate them at the roots, or are they pretty hardy?&nbsp; If I can do it without harming them, does anyone want any baby aloe plants?<br /><br />Thanks!
