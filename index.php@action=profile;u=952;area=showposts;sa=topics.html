					Hi,<br /><br />We are selling a birch veneer dining table that measures 55&quot;x35.5&quot; (seating for 4 people).&nbsp; It has two extension leaves that store underneath the table.&nbsp; When both leaves are installed, the table is nearly twice as long and could easily fit eight people.<br /><br />There are a few dings and scratches, but overall the table is in very good condition (leaves are in mint condition, as we rarely use them except for parties).<br /><br />$60<br /><br />Send me a PM or email <a href="mailto:jason.munshisouth@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">jason.munshisouth@gmail.com</a> if you would like to see it.

					There is a new crepe place at 61st St &amp; Woodside...we went there today and it was actually pretty good!&nbsp; &nbsp;They have savory buckwheat crepes with some classic (ham, egg, cheese) and nouveau fillings (tiger shrimp).&nbsp; And the lighter-colored dessert crepes with classic (butter &amp; sugar, Nutella) and nouveau (coconut, S&#039;mores).<br /><br />We tried the veggie crepe and a beef, onion, and gruyere savory crepe on special, and a nutella and banana for dessert.&nbsp; All the crepes were soft and not too thick or chewy.&nbsp; There isn&#039;t much seating, but the place is cute and you could definitely eat standing up outside.<br /><br />The chef told me she opened in Woodside because she has an aunt that lives there and the rent is cheap.&nbsp; This place is her first restaurant...kind of reminds me of Nixtamal and Timmy O&#039;s in that someone is trying something new in a place where the cost of entry isn&#039;t too high.&nbsp; <br /><br />Definitely would recommend you try this place out, especially those that were hoping for Le Gamin in our neighborhood!

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />I need to clear some space in the apartment and am looking to sell an IKEA kitchen cart.&nbsp; It has 10 hooks for hanging pots and pans (10&quot; skillet pictured for scale), and could potentially be used as a butcher block.&nbsp; The top is very heavy, solid wood, although should be sanded to a very fine grain before being used for food (as per the instructions when we first bought it).&nbsp; It has two wheels on the bottom and is very easy to move around despite its heaviness.<br /><br />We used this item as a microwave cart for a couple of years, so it is in very good shape.&nbsp; It was originally about $125; we are asking for $50.<br /><br />We live on 73rd St b/w B&#039;way and 37th Ave.&nbsp; Send me a message through JHLife if you are interested!

					We don&#039;t go to the food group because we have a one-year old who is a bit of a wild card at restaurants, but on the way to the Queens Zoo today we stopped by Tortilleria Nixtamal and Timmy O&#039;s.&nbsp; Both were fantastic!<br /><br />At Nixtamal we had the fish tacos and three kinds of tamales (verde, rajas, and italiano).&nbsp; The fish was fried very nicely...kind of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.&nbsp; But the tortilla is clearly the star.&nbsp; Very flavorful and perfect texture without being too heavy.&nbsp; We bought a pound to take home!&nbsp; The verde and rajas tamales were both solid, but we didn&#039;t think the tamales were as fantastic as the tortillas.&nbsp; The italiano is a fun one to try for a different flavor: italian sausage, mozarella and tomato sauce.&nbsp; They also have some good soda choices...we tried an apple-flavored one whose name escapes me.<br /><br />The owner let me take the kid in the basement to see them fermenting and grinding the masa.&nbsp; They have a tortilla machine up front, but it wasn&#039;t operating at the time.&nbsp; A NYTimes reporter was hanging around the place looking to interview people who came to buy masa, and he quickly found a couple all the way from Connecticut.<br /><br />Great service and can&#039;t wait to go back...hopefully the food group can report on more of the tacos and the pozole!<br /><br />Timmy O&#039;s is just a block or two away.&nbsp; Timmy was the only one there and seems to do most of the work himself.&nbsp; He makes frozen custard...see here for an explanation (more egg yolks and butterfat than ice cream!):<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_custard" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_custard</a><br /><br />Timmy was very talkative, so he told us a bit about the store.&nbsp; He&#039;s from Long Island, but traveled to a culinary institute in St. Louis (my hometown) to learn how to make frozen custard.&nbsp; There are dozens of custard places in St. Louis, and he went to most of them while he was there!&nbsp; Most he asked me about I had never even heard of.&nbsp; He sources his custard mix from a local high-end dairy, but the vanilla flavoring he uses comes from a supplier in St. Louis he makes up real vanilla for custard places.&nbsp; Timmy has a proprietary mix made from Madagascar and Seychelles vanilla beans that he is quite proud of!<br /><br />Daily he has chocolate, vanilla, and a &quot;flavor of the day&quot; which was dulce de leche.&nbsp; He&#039;ll let you try all three for free...you can get them mixed as &quot;concretes&quot; (a St. Louis term for frozen custard with ingredients blended in), but honestly the custard is better on its own.<br /><br />I wish both of these places were closer to 74th St, but rents are probably lower in Corona!&nbsp; Try out both and help them stay in business!

					A friend of mine at Fordham U. is organizing this project...may interest those of you with gardens!<br /><br />Volunteers needed to watch bees, free plants given out!<br /><br />Amazingly, over 220 native bee species have been identified living in the five boroughs of New York City, including large carpenter bees (the &quot;giants of the bee world&quot;), mining bees (which live underground), tiny green metallic bees, and several species of bumble bees. Through a program entitled â€œNew York City Bee Watchersâ€ (<a href="http://www.nycbeewatchers.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycbeewatchers.org/</a>) everyday New Yorkers help scientists understand where these bees live in the city by observing flowers in their own backyard, community garden, green roof or terrace. Volunteers watch for bees on specific flowers for 30 minutes once every two weeks. They then submit their observations on frequency of bee visits, type of bee, and other useful data via an online form. Itâ€™s an easy, great way to contribute to urban conservation, and a good excuse to get out on a sunny day and enjoy nature in the City.<br /><br />NYC Bee Watcher Orientations, held in all five boroughs of NYC, are free and open to the public. All attendees will receive free native wildflowers and one very special garden sunflower that ties our observations into a similar nationwide survey of bees.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bee Watcher 2009 Orientation Events<br /><br />All orientations are free and will be held in the evenings from 6:00 to 8:00 pm over the next two weeks. Please RSVP by clicking here or call 718-370-9044. Free plants will be provided and there will be a discussion of bee species of special interest and current bee conservation efforts in New York City.<br /><br />Brooklyn&nbsp; (Monday June <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cool.gif" alt="8&#41;" title="Cool" class="smiley" /> at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Ave.<br /><br />Bronx (Tuesday June 9) at the Van Cortlandt House Museum, Van Cortlandt Park<br /><br />Staten Island (Tuesday June 9) at the Greenbelt Nature Center, 700 Rockland Avenue<br /><br />Queens (Wednesday June 10) at Alley Pond Environmental Center (APEC), 228-06 Northern Blvd.<br /><br />Manhattan (Tuesday June 16) at Central Park&#039;s North Meadow Recreational Center off the 97th St. Transverse Rd.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Please bring friends and forward this email to anyone else you think might be interested.

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />My family and I closed on a co-op in JH in November 2008.&nbsp; &nbsp;During 2008-&#039;09 our building had about 60 rental units that were converted to co-op status and sold by a sponsor, so a significant fraction of the co-op residents are new owners.<br /><br />Earlier this year the co-op informed everybody that the maintenance fees would increase by 5% starting in April to cover a higher tax assessment.&nbsp; Even though the RE market has flattened or dropped in the area, the tax assessments apparently take a few years to catch up.&nbsp; Fair enough.<br /><br />This weekend everyone received a letter along with their maintenance bill stating that we are being charged an additional tax assessment this month of about $0.65 / share.&nbsp; In our building that works out to almost a double maintenance fee for the month of April.&nbsp; This is on top of the 5% increase in maintenance that kicked in this month.<br /><br />Here is where things get really confusing.&nbsp; Most of that additional assessment fee will be covered by the $400 NYC tax abatement, STAR , senior citizen programs, etc, <strong>EXCEPT FOR NEW RESIDENTS</strong>.&nbsp; The managing agent claims that new residents are not eligible for the tax abatement if we bought after Jan 1st 2008, so we will have to pay the full assessment.&nbsp; The management also suggests that they are taking the tax abatements to &quot;balance the budget&quot;, and not necessarily to cover higher RE taxes (although this point is not at all clear in the letter).<br /><br />If you have read this far, then I would like to request your opinion on the following questions:<br /><br />1) Does it seem right to charge an additional tax assessment if the maintenance has already been increased 5% to cover the higher tax bill?&nbsp; And maintenance fees in our building are higher than what I&#039;ve seen in RE ads for Jackson Heights, even though the building finances seem to be in good shape.<br /><br />2) If new residents are not eligible for the tax abatement because they weren&#039;t owners during the full period the abatement covers, then why are new residents &quot;eligible&quot; to be charged a full tax assessment?&nbsp; It seems like the management is having it both ways, but only in the ways that favor taking more money from us.<br /><br />My suspicion is that someone on the board or at the management agency saw a one-time opportunity to make a windfall off of the ~60 new owners in the building by charging this assessment when they knew the abatement was not available.&nbsp; Back of the envelope calculations would suggest that this additional tax assessment amounts to $40,000-$60,000 for the co-op.<br /><br />Thoughts?&nbsp; Other similar experiences?

					Anybody else see this article?&nbsp; Apparently some old white folks are afraid that Bellerose is becoming another Jackson Heights!&nbsp; It could just be one or two guys...it&#039;s hard to tell from an article such as this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/thecity/22froz.html?_r=1&amp;ref=thecity" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/thecity/22froz.html?_r=1&amp;ref=thecity</a><br /><br />I lived near this commercial area for about six months while waiting for renovations on my JH apt to be finished.&nbsp; Like many urban fringes, it has been in commercial decline for awhile (a combo of low population density and aging).&nbsp; If anything, the South Asian businesses are adding some much needed life.&nbsp; And the businesses are all on major commercial streets (mostly Hillside Avenue just east of the Cross Island)...it&#039;s not like they are opening inside residential neighborhoods.&nbsp; The pattern of development here is very much suburban, with strips of mini-malls and then separate neighborhoods of single-family houses with lawns.<br /><br />The &quot;City&quot; section in the New York Times lately seems to exist mostly for people to complain about how the city is changing or otherwise doesn&#039;t meet their desires and unrealistic standards.
