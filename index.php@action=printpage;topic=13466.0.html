				The folks at Zabb Elee&#039;s opened a sake bar/izakaya downstairs over the July 4th weekend! I can&#039;t tell you guys how excited I am about this new development in the neighborhood, just a few doors down from the fantastic beer offerings at UFC&#039;s and Little Tibet.<br /><br />Drinks: About 6-7 kinds of sake. Pitchers of Sapporo for $12, and an intriguing Japanese hefeweizen called Ginga.<br />Food: I didn&#039;t try a lot (I&#039;d already had my fill of UFC) but the little we did order was good.&nbsp; Izakaya style dishes like takowasa, grilled mackerel, fried chicken gizzards and shishito peppers were on the menu. They also have sushi, some rolls and Japanese style pasta. I&#039;d recommend talking to the friendly owners (Joe and Kam - hope I got their names right!) about the specials of the day and what fish they have. <br />Decor: Fun izakaya, reminiscent of Kenka in the East Village. It&#039;s very small, tight, and cosy, but there&#039;s been a lot of care taken with the aesthetics of this place. <br />Hours: 6pm to 2am most days, open till 4am on weekends.<br /><br />I&#039;m already planning to go back!

				Yeah, I went there post-meal (John Brown barbecue in. LIC) as well but the sake was great, cool environment and great tunes. Heard Robert Johnson, Bobs Dylan and Marley intestine I was there, a musical combo and soundtrack you don&#039;t hear often around here.

				Went there tonight and arrived just as Bob Marley was giving way to the Blues. Nice, low-key vibe, friendly staff, and the chef-owner stopped by our table to see how things were going.<br /><br />Classic Japanese pub food -- really tasty. We went with the steamed edamame, tender takoyaki (with chewy tidbits of octopus tentacle in the center), grilled Hokke (mackerel with grated daikon and a lime wedge on the side) and Napolitan (Japanese-Italian fusion spaghetti with tomato, bacon, onion, red bell pepper, parmesan and slivers of dried seaweed -- greasy and smoky in a perfect-with-a-beer kind of way). A couple of pics attached...<br /><br />Some of the other tables opted for sushi and sashimi. One of the orders we saw was elaborately presented in a giant cocktail glass filled with shaved ice and garnished with seashells and a cherry-blossom sprig.<br /><br />We saved room for the &quot;Dessert King,&quot; a fish-shaped pancake stuffed with red bean paste, served with green tea gelato, matcha warabi (sweet jelly cubes dusted with green tea powder) and more red bean paste.<br /><br />And we tried the Ginga Hefeweisen, which was very good. <br /><br />

				I have just visited this place once. The atmosphere was really cozy and welcoming but they mainly played Thai pop songs though. I recommend skipping the rolls (too Americanized, probably Thai-ized, and sweet). I wish there were yakitori and other grilled animal innards. With a few more draft beer options (ahem, like UFC a few doors away), I can imagine myself going there often, maybe too often.

				I&#039;ve also been once and loved everything about it--the food, the music, the service. The staff all seem excited to be a part of it and it&#039;s easy to share their enthusiasm. Our waitress told us they are expanding the menu next month. And here is a great write-up from dnainfo:<br /><br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150716/jackson-heights/sake-bar-offers-12-sapporo-pitchers-under-michelin-starred-thai-restaurant<br /><br />

Like puri, I also wish they have a better beer selection, but maybe it&#039;s better for my liver that they don&#039;t.

				I went there last week. <br /><br />Negatives.<br />The octopus starter was tough (I think this was an outlier) and the sake menu was small. There are much better sakes you can get for the same price at other izakayas and no cold sake by the glass.....<br /><br />Pluses<br />&nbsp;Place has a nice vibe, they were playing indie music and jazz. It is actually designed with a modicum of style, feels nice to sit there.<br />The mentai pasta was GREAT. Like an odd japanese version of linguini ala bottarga. Delicious.<br />I&#039;m sure the mackerel and the other cooked stuff is as good. The staff was really friendly.<br /><br />Get some good cold sakes by the glass and I&#039;ll be there a LOT more.<br /><br />

				checked it out last night for the first time and couldn&#039;t have been happier. had a few dishes that were stellar....the gizzards, fried perfectly and hit with just enough salt and pepper, the mentai pasta that lalochezia mentioned earlier and described to a t (I was reminded of taramasalata) and a Hamachi collar that was huge (and the most expensive thing on the menu).<br /><br />we got there around midnight and were the only couple there, but by 1:30, it was packed, and people were waiting to get in.<br />lovely, lovely service....such a great addition to the neighborhood!

				Really enjoyed the food here the other night.&nbsp; I will say that the wait time for our food was about an hour, even with only another table of patrons next to us.&nbsp; It felt very slow and we were starving.&nbsp; I might suggest ordering an appetizer - hopefully that would help with the wait.&nbsp; At one point they opened the door, and we had to ask them to shut it because the train going by every few minutes was extremely loud.&nbsp; Staff was very friendly though and I hope the wait time was just a blip in service and not the norm.

				Finally made it here the other night. We were a party of four and explored quite a bit of the menu. Quite simply, there is not another menu remotely similar to this one in the neighborhood. The mentai pasta with creamy cod roe sauce and nori was really fantastic. All the fried items were done perfectly -- the chicken gizzards had a great dose of black pepper. I really dug the two different takes on grilled mackerel. We had takoyaki and wasabi marinated octopus. The sushi, admittedly not traditional, tasted fresh and good. Even the desserts, which often aren&#039;t my thing, were great. <br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for something local and different, go to this place.&nbsp;

				Just want to chime in and sing the praises of this place. My wife and I had our anniversary dinner at Zabb Sake on Saturday night and couldn&#039;t have enjoyed it more. Really unique menu, and they&#039;ve made the most of a kind of weird location; it reminds me of Decibel in the East Village. With UFC, that little section of Roosevelt is in danger of becoming hip.

				Wow! Some friends from Manhattan called on Saturday morning asking if we were around, and if are interested in a &#039;food adventure&#039;&nbsp; we were home, and decided to go out for a late lunch.&nbsp; I choose Zabb Sake because our friend had lived +worked in Japan a few years ago. <br />We were all blown away by the food and the entire experience.&nbsp; It is a very cool, relaxed vibe, the servers were terrific.&nbsp; We had the Mentai pasta, 2 orders, Hokke (grilled salty mackerel) fried oysters, rice balls, and one other dish that was like fried balls covered with a light bbq flavor.&nbsp; <br />We will be back to try more items on the menu, sushi + ramen next time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				the new place has some really high points - and unusual dishes - on the menu. right now, they&#039;re doing a spicy strawberry and salted egg salad that&#039;s fantastic, kind of a spin on the papaya salad that every thai place serves these days.

				We went to the izakaya bar last night and I&#039;m sorry to say, the menu has completely changed. It was very adventurous when we went over a year ago, a real small-plate style resto with a ton of options.&nbsp; Now it seems to be mostly sushi (selections from a plastic-covered, illustrated menu) and a limited number of smallish dishes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going back.&nbsp; So bummed.
