				I don&#039;t think so, they didn&#039;t close to start renovation and expansion until after the first of the year. Things seem to be coming along pretty good; if the light&#039;s right you can see through the triangle cut outs around the construction shed door....

				Their post about the timeline for renovation was closing on January 11th, with an expected closure of a month. My guess is like just about like all renovation, it always takes longer than expected. Hopefully they&#039;ll be open again soon. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve seen any posts from them about hiring, but since the space will be bigger and they should be able to handle more customers and hopefully will need more staff, that would be a good indication that the reopening is just around the corner.

				Not sure if there is any change in official laptop policy, but I was there for lunch today and I saw someone using one. However, they seemed to be a bit understaffed today, so perhaps they did not have time to notice or deal with it. There was a line of customers for most of the time I was there. It may take them some time to adjust to having a bigger crowd to serve. The space is really nice, they do have a few new menu items, and the beers on tap seem to be a big hit.&nbsp; I was excited about the expansion, but I have to say I kind of missed the more intimate feel of the smaller place today. It&#039;s noisier now, which of course it will be in a bigger space with more customers. Can&#039;t have it both ways!
