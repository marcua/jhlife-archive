				I&#039;m moving to JH and have a small (under 20 lbs) dog. Any suggestions on a good rental building? I was excited about Washington Place, but they don&#039;t take pets. <br /><br />Thanks!

				The standard form lease in my building says &quot;no pets&quot; but everyone has cats or dogs.&nbsp; The Super even had a dog for a while.<br /><br />I have lived there for more that 20 years and always had 1 or two cats.<br /><br />It&#039;s at 35-64 84th St and it&#039;s owned by the Joseph Bruno Trust (718) 639-0476.&nbsp; The Trust has at least one other building in the neighborhood as well.

				in the realm of sublets, which is also a possibility, i can vouch that the warwick is a no-go for dogs, the manchester okay. i think i have seen pups walk in and out of buckingham hall but not 100 percent on that.<br /><br />good luck. you and your pal should be able to find a nice spot here.

				My building is pet friendly and there are usually&nbsp; studio apts open, sometimes larger ones too. I think the studios go for $950, and they&#039;re very large.&nbsp; The rental office # is 718 898-4221. Address 80-15 41st Ave. The people in the office are very nice. Rent stabilized, too.

				My building is very pet friendly.&nbsp; There are more tenants with puppies than without.&nbsp; The only pets they don&#039;t allow are lions, tigers and grizzillies.&nbsp; The building is 34-59 89th Street ... 89th Street between 34th &amp; 35th Avenues.&nbsp;

				The Windsor building at 72-17 on 34th Avenue is very pet friendly. Am not sure how many rentals are<br />available as the building is mostly co-op.<br />
