				As I walked by 79th Street between 35th and 37th Avenues yesterday, I happened to easily notice a couple of satellite dishes positioned on top of the row buildings on the west side of 79th and also on the roof of the building on the east side of 79th as you approach 37th Avenue.&nbsp; These dishes are viewable from street level.&nbsp; I may be wrong, but I thought that the Landmarks Preservation Committee only permitted these types of antennae only if they are not within eye view from street level?&nbsp; Does anyone know?&nbsp; I remember a while back when a few residents in our building asked about installation of these dishes, and at that time, the board of directors clearly stated &quot;no way&quot;.

				I was told that satellite dishes were not allowed, too.&nbsp; I got digital cable DVR instead.&nbsp; Maybe those satellite dishes are illegally positioned?

				If you look closely, there are many violations in the District, including - most glaringly and defiantly - the metal cladding being gradually installed on the top of the building on the south side of 35th Avenue between 79th and 80th streets.

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised that if this cladding is indeed in violation, that at some point, the LPC will be called upon to investigate.&nbsp; A little over a year ago or so, the owners of a&nbsp; building located at 83rd Street and 35th Avenue were found in violation by the LPC for having illegally removed and destroyed original decorative sculptures from the building&#039;s facade and also removing original iron fencing, fixtures, etc.&nbsp; I believe JHBG had a hand in bringing this to the attention of the LPC, and ultimately, after trying to pull a fast one, the owners were ordered to restore the destroyed items.&nbsp; Unfortunately, decorative terracota dolphins which adorned the exterior of the building were completely destroyed and could not be replaced.<br /><br />Off hand, it would be pretty simple to check for the appropriate work permits at the DOB&#039;s website.&nbsp; The &quot;cladding&quot; building&#039;s address no. would be needed to check on this.

				There is no question that the cladding (a cheap shortcut aimed at eliminating the need for repointing) is a flagrant violation, and the building has been reported more than once for it; the illegal installation has been under way for approximately two years. The problem is that the Landmarks Commission lacks sufficient enforcement resources. Various residents in the building have expressed outrage about the fact that it has been reported, so the Commission has obviously written some kind of warning letter. <br />
