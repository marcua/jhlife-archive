					oooooh!!! looks like the truth hurts.<br /><br />First of all Username/jjhs you have a point about how our heritages yours/mine came here, so in essence we all need to pack clean up it up and give it back to the Indians.<br /><br />In the 1600&#039;s the Dutch/German were the first to come to NY and dominate and eradicate the American Indians the true Americans out of the this land. The oldest and riches families that came here were the Rockefeller&#039;s, Astors, The Bronx family<br />which the Bronx and one time was an estate. How&#039;s that for history....<br /><br />What I should have included but for got, so I will do it now is that one posters had said that the people were dreaming of yest-er year. Yest er year was when immigrants came here in the late 1800&#039;s/1900&#039;s, and followed the laws of the land<br />they kept it clean and did not turn it into what look like their home back from where ever. Hung the American Flag with pride and learned the language as best as they could. They came here humbled by the experience and tried to fit or blend in. <br /><br />They did not spit on the floor/ throw garbage on the ground nor did they trash apartments.<br />The mentality was way different back then and the caring and respect they showed is far different than today.<br />More over the men dressed well wore actual jacket and slacks, women wore dresses coats and would not dream of wearing some of the outfits that some of men and women wear today. Back most men and women didn&#039;t have much as far as clothes go except for the wealthy. However the one or two suits that did have were kept clean worn everyday. Back then people knew how to carry themselves today I have no idea what is going on in the minds of&nbsp; people.<br /><br />If I were to move to another country the right thing to do is ask what are the proper procedures to follow of the land,and not to piss anyone off or offend them that&#039;s all I am saying here. There are rules here that are broken from spitting on the floor to turning your terrace into a storage place that it makes it look like Beijing.....is what makes neighborhood look bad.<br /><br />Yet, from the sounds of it you seem like the type to plop down anywhere do as you feel, and make a comment well in my country it&#039;s ok to do this....Good night.

					The only way JH can be cleaned up is to get rid of the illegals, all of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;:tickedoff:<br /><br />They lived in squalor&#039;s in their country, and then come here and trash it up.<br />Most don&#039;t follow the rules and regulations of how to keep things clean and neat.<br />If they handed out tickets for every person spitting on the street we would be able to pay China back in no time.<br /><br />Over the weekend I was standing at the bus stop and standing next to me was a young guy he looked over to his left and spit with in and inch of his own foot, and then did it again. I moved over and he gave me a look like what is wrong with me...Now I do not know when spitting became a past time or a hobby.<br />But do people think this is sanitary, and don&#039;t people think that this contributes to diseases.<br /><br />&nbsp;I do know is that I am sick of seeing the ground covered with gum, dog crap, dog urine, garbage, homes that have been converted into store fronts. Mattresses in the front peoples homes.<br /><br />I shutter at the thought of brothels here with women who were or are brought here to perform sex acts against their will. Forest Hills is the Beverly Hills of Queens and this in no way shape or form would this happen. BTY, that is how most of these so called store fronts are able to pay the rent. It is because most are dubious. <br />

					Many years ago, they use to have a sign in writing that is:<br /><br />No eating<br />No music playing<br />No spitting<br /><br />Young enough to ride for free<br />Young enough to ride your knee<br /><br />Also you were not allowed to cross your legs on the trains and buses, and yes there is a rule that if you put your bag or other items on the seat next&nbsp; to you, you will be fined.<br /><br />Now all these rules are broken all the time, and I don&#039;t see the cops doing really much of anything.<br />They need to post these signs in English, Spanish,Chinese, Russian, Indian, Arabic. :coolsmiley:<br /><br />But even then people will break the rules because the feel they are entitled.<br />

					I have just learned about the Cavilear closing....<br /><br />Yes this is sad to see, I just wonder that if major retailers move in will that jack up the apartment rentals as well as the Co-ops/ Condos, and the storefront rents even more? Forest Hills apartments are through the roof.<br /><br />Storefronts as well one person was asking for $20,000 per month yes that&#039;s right folks 20G&#039;s. The owner that I spoke to was not budging at all. Perfumania was suppose to take over but could not even get a leg up now some other vitamin store will try to open. So far we have Starbucks and the rule of thumb is that once a retailer such as SB moves in and is able to maintain it self more will follow.<br /><br />I do agree with the poster who said we need to write to Dromm about the sky high rents.<br />As some know that I have been looking to open a business here but the rents are killer....are the owners of Cavilear crazy 16K is a heavy note....Or maybe they will sell the land and build an apartment building.<br /><br /><br />77 Th

					The problem with the MTA is that your are limited to what you can open, they will not let you sell any food or open a news paper stand. Not sure how the flower shop will work out.<br /><br />I wonder if they asked about the elevators sometimes they don&#039;t work so how would one get stock down to the shop? When I noticed that I said for get it...all it takes is one time.

					Thanks to all those who responded and gave good ideas, however I do not think there would be enough clientele to sustain such businesses like Jewish Deli, bookstore.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also the rents are through the roof at $4000 a month and up. For some reason the building owners think that because there is so much foot traffic people will be stopping in from morning till night, not so...If the price of goods is too low you will not be able to pay your cost and still make a profit. Then again if your cost is too high you still lose because know one can afford to pay. <br /><br />I am all about profit, but not to the point where I make people feel that they cannot afford anything, and leave feeling uncomfortable... Get this on 82ND St. a Verizon store is opening soon, when I inquired about the space the owner was asking for $8500 per month...So my brainstorming still continues.<br /><br />Thanks 77

					A gym would be too costly the insurance I am certain would be killer, and to maintain the machines would be costly as well.<br /><br />In addition to the cheese what else you would like to see, I am sure an assortment of cracker&#039;s, how about caviar as well... I&nbsp; recently have become a fan and learned like wine caviar need not be expensive to enjoy!! <br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t stop at that guys come on, what else....<br /><br />PS Chuckter thanks for the thread <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Merry Christmas to all...<br /><br />77th

					Hello neighbors!!!!<br /><br />OK, maybe you all can help me out here I was going to open a wine shop but, was beat to the punch... <img src="Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" /><br /><br />So, now I am going to the community to ask you what do you want to have hear that you will enjoy going too and shop. I have read some posts about too many hair/nail salons/pharmacies and I agree..<br /><br />I would love to have some feed back, after all it is our neighborhood, and has potential to roll back to what it use to be, after all JH rivaled Forest Hills. <br /><br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />77
