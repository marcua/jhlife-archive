			Massage and Pilates in Jackson Heights - Christine Ferris, Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) and Pilates Instructor, is now scheduling appointments at 2nd Story Pilates + Yoga, near 82nd St. and 37th Ave. Therapeutic Massage addresses imbalances in the body preventing future injuries and relieving pain and dysfunction resulting from repetitive motion. Massage Therapy is a vital component of recovery from both chronic and recent injuries. As a preventative, massage therapy pinpoints the specific areas in the body where one holds onto daily aggravations. Therapeutic Massage integrates the person as a whole enabling the ability to unwind and experience better restorative sleep.<br /><br />Private Pilates - Learn more about your movement and how it impacts you as a whole. Sessions offer a unique personalized look at an individual’s workout needs. Through spring resistance equipment training and/or mat work we identify existing strengths and work to strengthen areas of weaknesses. Pilates integrates the body as a coordinated moving organism.<br /><br />Christine Ferris, LMT, holds an Associate Degree from the Swedish Institute of Massage (2000), and is certified by the Goodson Parker Wellness Center in Pilates (2000). She has been a practicing Licensed Massage Therapist and Pilates Instructor in New York State since 2000. Chris worked at Sloan Kettering Integrative Medicine Center for 11 years as a Massage Therapist and Pilates Instructor. Currently Chris has a private practice in Massage and Pilates. Additionally, Chris is an accomplished choreographer and dancer and creates performance works for her dance company Chris Ferris &amp; Dancers.<br /><br />I am fully vaccinated, wear a face mask, and take my clients’ safety seriously. Face masks are required for all clients, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, throughout each appointment.<br /><br />All sessions are by appointment only.
