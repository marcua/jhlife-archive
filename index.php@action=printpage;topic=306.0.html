				Here&#039;s an article about the event from today&#039;s Times Ledger:<br /><br />http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19207741&amp;BRD=2676&amp;PAG=461<br />New Visions Dem Club hears pro, con cases<br />By Howard Koplowitz<br />01/17/2008<br /><br />Representatives from two opposing sides in the congestion pricing debate argued their cases before the New Visions Democratic Club in Jackson Heights last week.<br /><br />Dan Hendrick, the communications director for the New York League of Conservation Voters, said congestion pricing is needed because &quot;the city is going to grow.<br /><br />But Corey Bearak, a policy adviser for the interest group Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, contended that congestion pricing was a &quot;tax&quot; that had more to do with paying for mass transit improvements than relieving Manhattan traffic. He said there are better ways to come up with funding for buses and subways.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s very clear it&#039;s all about revenue for mass transit,&quot; said Bearak, who is also the president of the Queens Civic Congress, a role he insists he keeps separate from his consulting work for the anti-congestion pricing interest group.<br /><br />Hendrick said congestion costs the city between $12 billion and $15 billion a year from fuel costs and loss of productivity.<br /><br />&quot;The subways are so crowded now. There&#039;s just no way it&#039;s going to work,&quot; Hendrick said.<br /><br />Of the 40 percent of Queens residents who work in Manhattan, 18 percent drive into the city, he said.<br /><br />Funds from congestion pricing would go toward improving mass transit, an idea that Hendrick advocated.<br /><br />&quot;There&#039;s been a systemic under-funding of our transit system for some time,&quot; he said.<br /><br />With congestion pricing, Hendrick said, &quot;you hit two birds with one stone. You reduce traffic and it&#039;s a fine way to fund your transit system.&quot;<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>
