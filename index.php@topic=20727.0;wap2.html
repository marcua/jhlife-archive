			The final evening of this series, its Program C @6:30PM,&nbsp; features a doc I shot in 2019 and that previewed at the end of that year, at Terraza 7.&nbsp; Small Kitchens (28 mins. 2020 sevenlocalfilm.com) connects and contrasts work and food between a Mexican cart and a Nepali restaurant both owned by immigrant women under the 7 train.&nbsp; It&#039;s an observational tone poem that intercuts multicam footage, including POV shots from cameras operated by workers, across an entire day and night along Jackson Heights-Elmhurst border.&nbsp; It&#039;s also now a time-capsule of life here just before Covid Time.&nbsp; It inadvertently captures some of the social context for why, and how, and towards whom the coronavirus was so particularly deadly here. During the pandemic, I took advantage of the pause in many other things to undertake much needed postproduction work on the 2019 footage. More recently, in preparation for this series, I produced a 2021 Epilogue that returns to these Small Kitchens to think about their resilience and that of the communities that constitute our area; it also contemplates the place of Terraza 7 in out community through the Pandemic.&nbsp; An amazing recent Terraza 7 performance Ari Hoenig, Chico Pinheiro, and Eduardo Belo â€“ who are the jazz trio Abare - generously contribute the soundtrack and appear in the Epilogue as well; their interpretation of Dizzy Gillespie&#039;s &quot;Woody &#039;n You&quot; is really the script to which I edited.&nbsp; You can check out more about this evening and the others in this series at https://terraza7.com/event/small-kitchens-film-screening-filmmaker-seth-fein-qa/<br /><br />This series is free thanks to a #CityArtistCorps Grant from the New York Foundation of the Arts, the NYC Dept of Cultural Affairs, the Mayor&#039;s Office of Media and Entertainment, and the Queens Theatre.<br /><br />Small Kitchens received support from a 2019 New Work Grant from the Queens Council on the Arts.
