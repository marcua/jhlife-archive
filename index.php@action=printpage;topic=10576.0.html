				Good afternoon to all of you and happy 2014 !!!!<br /><br />Have you considered registering your child to art classes? If so, why not do it NOW? ART FOR A START Spring semester is starting this week!!! Attached is the class schedule.&nbsp; Feel free to contact me with any questions or inquiries you may have.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yours,<br />Deborah<br />www.artforastartnyc.com<br /><br /><br /><br />I recently read an article in the NYTimes entitled: Art Makes You Smart http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/art-makes-you-smart.html?_r=0) and I could not agree more.&nbsp; Working as an art educator for over fifteen years, I&nbsp; witnessed how exposure to art has contributed to the overall well being of my students and to their mental, verbal and creative development. Having tutored art students for high schools and universities, it&#039;s evident that the development of drawing capabilities and design tools from an early age is invaluable.&nbsp; My arts program is Inquiry-based, no crafty and cookie-cutter projects, no rigid emphasis on techniques. The curriculum<br />&nbsp;emphasizes&nbsp; explorations, skill building, creativity and experimentation. My life&#039;s mission is to share my passion for the arts through my artwork and teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />ART FOR A START 2014 ACADEMIC YEAR SCHEDULE<br />&nbsp;<br />*Spring Semester starts on January 7th and will end on June 25th.<br /><br />All regular classes are one hour long and the fee is $15.00 per class, including materials. We create a thematic and well-planned curriculum and send weekly emails informing parents about our plan for the week. Subjects to explore throughout the year:<br />&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in drawings<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Techniques in painting<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Collage techniques<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sculpture and 3-d<br />-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watercolors<br />&nbsp;<br />All classes are taught by artist and educator Deborah Wasserman. Our program is considered by many as exceptional, and we have students who are now registering for their third year.<br />&nbsp;<br />SPRING SEMESTER 2014<br />&nbsp;<br />Regular weekly classes<br />Art for a Start offers four sessions per week at P.S. 69<br />(37th Avenue between 77th and 78th Street):<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wednesdays 4:00PM-5:00PM and 5:00PM-6:00PM.<br />&nbsp;<br />The 4:00PM classes are geared towards younger students (ages 5-7) and the 5:00PM classes are geared towards older students (ages 7-9). If your child&#039;s schedule cannot accommodate these particular age groups, we suggest that you still take one or two trial classes, as many students end up thriving with younger/older peers.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Students can take up to two trial classes before you make a full commitment for one semester. Trial classes are paid classes.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Fees: We require a first month and last month payment for each semester when registering plus a $10.00 registration fee. The last month payment covers the fee for the month on which the semester ends.&nbsp; If you choose to leave the program before it ends, you will lose your last month payment. We are open to make exceptions to this rule in the case of an emergency or any unplanned circumstances.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Enrollment is capped at 10 students per class. Keeping our classes small allows us to give more personal attention to each student.<br />&nbsp;<br />- Make up classes are available. Tuesdays and Wednesdays classes are very similar in age and content.&nbsp; You are welcome to bring your child to any of these classes if he or she missed their regular class. <br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes<br />Saturday classes take place at Mondo Studios in Woodside<br />(33-55 55th Street between 37th Ave. and Broadway, one block from the M/R Northern Blvd subway station).<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10:00AM-11:00PM<br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11:00:00-12:00 <br />•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12:00 to 1:00PM<br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday Advanced classes are one hour long, specialized lessons with no more than five students per class. Featuring an in-depth exploration of techniques and the use of professional materials. Students work progressively on elaborate projects over a period of weeks.<br />&nbsp;<br />-The fee for advanced classes is $25.00 per session.<br />- Enrollment is capped at 5 students per class.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />PRIVATE CLASSES: We are available to schedule private classes throughout the year.&nbsp; Please contact us if interested in arranging a meeting to discuss the possibility of a private art class.&nbsp; &nbsp;We offer portfolio preparation class for teenagers and young adults who are applying for art schools and are seeking to build a strong presentation. We also offer private classes for young students who are interested in more focused, artistic training.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />REGISTRATION:<br />&nbsp;<br />Tuesdays:<br />&nbsp;4:00PM-5:00PM, Ages 5-7 Location: P.S. 69. Still open for registration.<br />&nbsp;5:00PM-6:00PM, Ages 6-9 Location: P.S. 69. Still open for&nbsp; registration.<br /><br />Wednesdays:<br />&nbsp;4:00PM-5:00PM, Ages 5-7 Location: P.S. 69.
