					Some of us met with Danny Dromm&#039;s office today for a very productive meeting.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what we got: First, the plaza is in a very early phase right now. What we see there is not the final product. DOT will be doing community outreach sometime in the fall to come up with a final vision. It is important that everyone who is available be there to make their voices and opinions heard. This will determine the eventual design of the space.<br /><br />Second, whatever plan is ultimately drafted will not be implemented for at least another year.<br /><br />Third, there is a chance this process might be sped up if enough community pressure is applied. This would require all of us coming together and petitioning.<br /><br />Fourth and most importantly, since the final phase won&#039;t be here for a while, it is up to us the community to make this space work in the meantime. The city has its own schedule, which is going to be drawn out. For the time being, getting more immediate results will require people stepping up, getting involved, and helping out. SUKHI went out on a limb to get this plaza started. They are very small in capacity and both need and welcome help. So criticizing them will get us nowhere. Offering our assistance as a community will move this thing forward.<br /><br />Those of us who met with Dromm&#039;s office today will be meeting again next week to talk about some next steps. Anyone who is interested in making this space successful is encouraged and more than welcome to join. Feel free to let know what days and times you are available to meet.

					I was in that Astoria neighborhood that night when this went down, and watched as a SWAT team stormed a building development&#039;s courtyard in search of this guy. I doubt that he--61-year-old Gary Sarback--is anywhere near East Elmhurst or Astoria right now, but for what it&#039;s worth, here&#039;s what he looks like:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/35/astoriachasesuspect_web_2013_08_24_q.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/35/astoriachasesuspect_web_2013_08_24_q.html</a>

					I definitely never said that I <em>want</em> to leave it up to SUKHI. I said that it appears that it currently <em>is</em> up to SUKHI. But more importantly, it is up to the community as a whole, which leaves the door open for a change of partner organization. I think most people agree that JHBG has done a very good job with 78th Street. Things are moving along nicely there. I do not know what their capacity is, and whether they could help manage another plaza. I am sure they would do a great job. Honestly, I would first be interested in pressuring SUKHI to step up and do what they have been tasked to do. If that does not work, I would have no problem exploring what avenues are available to change management, if possible. Like Rhino said, the business owners along 37th Road fought pretty hard to prevent this plaza. Whether these are the exact same people who now comprise SUKHI I do not know. Was there some sort of bargain made? I would be curious to know what the deal is with them, and whether they are really up to the job.<br /><br />I would be happy to speak with Dromm about this and getting the facts. Anyone interested in joining me?

This is done in phasing. The Diversity Plaza is still in an early phase. It seems the tables and seating were taken out to resurface the road. Not sure why they haven&#039;t been put back in though. As for maintenance, this is up to the community. The local business coalition SUKHI is apparently in charge of this. Again, not sure how involved they actually are. The success of this space will require the community to step up and take ownership. The city will only do so much. Progress has definitely been slow on their part, and it&#039;s a shame the plaza wasn&#039;t complete for the summer, but I&#039;m sure more development is on its way. As for maintenance like plant-watering, contact SUKHI or Dromm. Watering plants should not be beyond the capacity of a local partnering organization--the barest minimum capacity at that.

					I don&#039;t know what Party Pizza is either, but it is a shame that U Dzika didn&#039;t make it. That was a high-quality family-run business for the very short time that it operated in this neighborhood. I had the opportunity to speak with the owners several times before they closed. The husband came to this country many years in advance to start working and saving for this business. The wife--who interestingly was a vegetarian herself--oversaw the preparation of fresh Polish food that easily rivaled that of Greenpoint or Ridgewood. Their grownup kids regularly helped out in running the place, and all them would take the time to sit down and talk and eat with their customers. The food and atmosphere were amazing, and it really is too bad that it never attracted the customer base to survive. I would hope that Pizza Party rises to that level of neighborliness, and that more businesses like U Dzika consider this neighborhood a place to establish themselves. I also wonder if anyone else had similar impressions of this place. Comments were very limited when they closed a couple years ago.

					I have been hoping for a pub this whole time as well, but I have to say I am pretty satisfied with Arunee moving there. They are a very well-run business I think. Actually, I have always liked their current location, tucked away a little, but 37th Avenue will be a good location for them. Though we still have to wait a little longer for a simple pub to open.

					Reverting the plaza to a vehicular thoroughfare will not cause the junkies to spontaneously disappear. I saw many of those same people around that area of the neighborhood before the plaza was installed. On the other hand, planters and tables will also not cause them to disappear. It is often assumed that parks and open space alleviate surrounding social ills. Instead, in many cases, they simply adopt the flavor of their surroundings. That said, better maintained areas do tend to instill a sense of respect among visitors; the opposite it often true for poorly maintained areas. Though this is not a law of nature. This is a wonderful neighborhood, warts and all. So while it is safe to say that this plaza will not be without its nuisances, I believe it will eventually be an excellent space that reflects that overwhelming positive characteristics of the neighborhood. But it will require maintenance and oversight.<br /><br />It should probably also be noted that the DOT installs these plazas in phases. I am a bit surprised myself that more has not been rolled out this summer. But the recent gravel surface treatment is a sign of progress. All of the city&#039;s DOT plazas have some local organization that oversees them. I know SUKHI is a local coalition of business owners, but I am still not sure who they are, or how involved they have been. I am sure Danny Dromm&#039;s office could put inquirers in touch with them. In terms of we the community steering the design of the plaza, my guess is that any public outreach has already been done, but I&#039;m not sure. It might be worth contacting DOT to check. As it appears, the plaza is here to stay, though by no means near completion. I am looking forward to this myself. And its important to keep in mind that the DOT will pay for the study, designs, and installation. But it is up to the community to make the space work.

					I love that cat. And I agree with past posters that the best way to deal with a concern like this is to simply talk with the owners themselves, who are very approachable. They seem to have responded extremely quickly to the exaggerated neighborhood fury that surrounded the USAgain dropbox a few months ago. I am actually pretty surprised by the sporadic but noticeable hostility that this very charming business receives on this forum. The public support clearly outweighs it, but the occasional hostility focused on this store is bizarre.

As to the other point: &quot;What&#039;s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.&quot; That is, it is perfectly fair to object to a building&#039;s qualities or occupants. But to object to its name? I&#039;m not so sure how big of an issue that is. Would I have named the building that? Most likely not. Does it matter, all things considered? Not in the slightest. Were some clandestine cabal from China buying out and renaming The Chateau, The Belvedere, and the Greystones, we might have a discussion. Otherwise, I see no reason for this thread, sorry. I agree with sl on this one.

					I&#039;m glad to hear that barbecue will remain available in the neighborhood. Friends from around the country have been trying to teach me recently about all the different regional styles of barbecue: Carolinas, Kansas City, etc. Any idea what distinguishes the BBQ at Legends as Texan?

					Oh yes, the Tenement Museum is great, though I honestly haven&#039;t taken their tour since it first opened. The one bathroom in the hallway was actually a very progressive improvement over the communal outhouse originally in the back courtyards!<br /><br />And I think you are right that the illegal conversions are essentially status quo at this point. I have read that the majority of units added to the Queens housing stock since at least 1990 are of this nature. My hope is that either they are brought into the safe and regulated housing market somehow, or that sufficient affordable housing is developed. But there are so many different parties and interests involved, and too many people seem content to keep things as they are. And as Brook Lynn pointed out, this can often pit neighbor against neighbor, which is not desirable, but nothing new either.
