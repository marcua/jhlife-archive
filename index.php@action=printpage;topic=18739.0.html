				I used to go there OFTEN when I was younger. We are talking well over two decades ago. I remember it was a bit cramped - the prices were always much higher than the Wiz and Coconuts where I usually bought my cassette tapes from. But it was a great play to pick up vinyl and you often had a lot of local aspiring DJ&#039;s coming by there to pick up the latest tunes.

				I used to shop there as a teen, primarily at the smaller store that was located at the corner of 78th Street.&nbsp; Apart from records, they also sold silk screen t-shirts of rock musicians, and posters.

				Wow, I always forget this board exists, I used to post here a lot.<br /><br />Anyway, NUMBERS was the record (yes record) store, and eventually CDs and Tapes.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t always on at 77-11 though.&nbsp; Orighinally it was on the corner where the Apple Bank is now, until maybe the late 80s, early 90s.&nbsp; I know by 1991 it was in the 77-11 spot, across from PS 69.<br /><br />I spent many a $2 and change on 45s there in the mid 1980s.<br /><br /><br /><br />
