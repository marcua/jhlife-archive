				Hello,<br /><br />As a resident who lives in the low 70&#039;s it is always a pleasure to see the pristine condition that Windsor is kept.&nbsp; This has changed since work is being done on the building and a scaffold is up.<br /><br />Does anyone know what type of work is taking place?&nbsp; I sure hope they don&#039;t do anything that changes the appearance of the grounds and building.&nbsp;

				It would appear that The Windsor is a part of the historic district (and possibly landmarked itself?), so in all probability they will not be able to do anything that changes the outward appearance of the building (short of adding a ramp to make the building ADA compliant or something of that nature).

				&nbsp;FYI the Windsor is not in the Historic District by a few blocks. The grounds have deteriorated in recent<br />years from the looks of things.

				Actually, I would say the grounds are looking better than ever. I have friends who live in the building and I have to say, I&#039;m jealous. The Windsor has cleverly approached its landscape in ways that might be lost on those who aren&#039;t savvy about design and urban ecology, but The Windsor is WAY ahead of its time for a number of reasons.<br /><br />1) They designed their back area to be more accessible than it once was. It provides grouping of intimate seating for small gatherings and individuals. It&#039;s lovely, protected, and well tended without being overly manicured and sterile. It has two functional compost bins (one for active composting and one for resting) that are dutifully tended by building residents. They&#039;ve thoughtfully approached rules for its use, so noise won&#039;t become a nuisance late into the evening. <br /><br />2) They&#039;ve maintained the historic foundation plantings around the building&#039;s perimeter, respecting the neighborhood vernacular and blending nicely with other period nearby buildings. I would love to see them underplant rather than mulch...but it&#039;s not my building.<br /><br />3) Maybe the most exciting is their entry garden, which is entirely native species. Healthy landscapes are dynamic, diverse, and support native ecology. Their front garden bursts with drifts of phlox early in the spring, has impressive asters even late into the fall, and dazzling winterberries through the coldest months. It&#039;s constantly changing with the seasons, stepping away from the tight static default of azaleas, yew, hydrangeas, and the other ubiquitous conventional suburban plantings that have robbed our environment of much of any ecological function. Don&#039;t even get me started on how native gardens outperform when it comes to carbon sequestration, stormwater management, or educating youngsters about the environment... <br /><br />I wish my building did half of what The Windsor has implemented. We just have concrete and no will power to even compost. <br />Scaffolding can be tough on plants, it robs them of light, ventilation, and water - not to mention the physical damage at its base. Here&#039;s hoping The Windsor&#039;s landscape rebounds quickly, and that more neighbors will wake up to the importance of landscapes, even small ones, in urban environments, as well as beauties beyond the overpruned and overmulched.

				&nbsp;I am sorry to say that this is not most people&#039;s opinion of the Windsor&#039;s garden. There are way more interesting, sustainable and progressive gardens in the nabe, both co-ops and private homes.

				This sure looks like a personal response by a deeply angry person who is so afraid of conflict they have to hide behind a screen name and the old &quot;most people....&quot;.<br /><br />I do wonder what the [<strong>removed by moderator]</strong> has to say about their <strong>[removed by moderator]</strong> members publicly disparaging neighborhood gardens.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />The post above was edited by a moderator.

				Most people I talked to at the Windsor --when I was attending a party and the subject came up-- did seem to like it. Though, I admit it&#039;s probably not a fair sampling. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry that it might not be to your liking, Itsit. As I&#039;m sure you know, living in a coop can often mean not getting exactly what you want; it&#039;s usually more often about finding a balance with what everyone wants, who&#039;s communicating effectively and respectfully, and who&#039;s actually willing to role up their sleeves and do the (often-thankless) work of building leadership. Other landscapes might be more interesting (very subjective), and sustainable and progressive (less subjective). I haven&#039;t seen many of them in JH, but you seem confident, so I&#039;ll take you at your word. That said, just because other landscapes might be better in your estimation, I&#039;d hope you can see that shouldn&#039;t discredit what the Windsor&#039;s landscape is doing. I&#039;d encourage you to really think about if you don&#039;t like the landscape or if your dislike stems from something/someone you don&#039;t like about your history in the building. I say that sincerely and not to be condescending, it&#039;s a thing I struggle with in my building (and life) too.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
