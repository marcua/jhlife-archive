								<div class="inner" id="msg_31704">Does anyone know what percentage of full fee to pay to a lawyer if a coop purchase does not go to closing? Does anyone know how long a board can take before replying if one is accepted or denied?<br /><br />Unfortunately, my husband and I ended up dealing with a local realtor who adviced us on a &quot;good lawyer&quot; and a &quot;good loan officer&quot; for the purchase of &quot;wonderful JH 1 bedroom<br />&nbsp;coop&quot;. The loan officer did not advice us properly and completely delayed the process by at least one full month by which time we changed to another bank. The lawyer most of the time did not care about our case and if it wasn&#039;t for her sweet secretary who was diligent, we would have fired her a long time ago. Seriously, this was one horrible lawyer who also delayed many things and hardly advocated in our behalf. Her response half of the time was &quot;call the realtor&quot; who is her friend. The realtor was another fake who said that she knew people in the building and can move things along and of course when the time came, she didn&#039;t know anything. So now after being 6 months in this purchase process, the board is taking almost two weeks to reply if we are accepted or not. It took them over a month from our board application submission for them to schedule an interview and now are taking more time that are causing lots of bank rate extension fees in our behalf. Is this usual for coops to take this long? To make matters worse now the bank is asking for the 2009 financials which the coop doesn&#039;t have and alleges that it will take a few months for this to be available. Needless to say this overall is a nightmare. We are completely turned off by the coop and their delays. After pleading with the bank, they decided to accept the operating budget instead as long as we close by the end of the month. We told the board of this through their managing agent and apparently they don&#039;t care. Not sure we want to live in a building who is so disconsiderate. So we are actually hoping that the board will deny us. We are mainly concerned how much we have to pay our uncaring lawyer from the original quote she gave us. Any input will be greatly appreciated. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_31706">Hi,<br />This is a lengthy response to your real estate concerns. &nbsp;And yes you do have to pay a fee for my time. &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;There is your side, the other side and then there is the truth. &nbsp;I am currently working on real estate transactions and all stories sound the same. &nbsp;Everyone is complaining about the delays and they are very real. &nbsp;So read below and perhaps it will all make some sense.<br /><br />JHMerlin: Does anyone know what percentage of full fee to pay to a lawyer if a coop purchase does not go to closing? <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;It has been my experience, while working with many attorneys, that you pay the fee at closing. &nbsp;If there is no closing you do not pay a fee. &nbsp;Some attorneys will ask for an administrative fee when you retain them as they have to make phone calls, review contract and co-op documents as well, prior to the closing. &nbsp;If there is no closing they get paid nothing and time has been wasted. &nbsp;They still have to pay for the expenses that they have incurred. &nbsp;And that lovely secretary has to get paid for assisting you when the attorney wasn&#039;t available for you.<br /><br />JHMerlin: Does anyone know how long a board can take before replying if one is accepted or denied?<br /><br />Response: The board usually takes approximately a week to two weeks in responding to your application. &nbsp;Some boards will contact you by phone, some boards will send you a letter.<br /><br />JHMerlin: Unfortunately, my husband and I ended up dealing with a local realtor who adviced us on a &quot;good lawyer&quot; and a &quot;good loan officer&quot; for the purchase of &quot;wonderful JH 1 bedroom coop&quot;.<br /><br />Response: &nbsp;The majority of our local realtors will give you a list of lawyers and bankers so you can select someone yourself. &nbsp;Our community has many good lawyers, many good loan officers and wonderful one bedroom coops.<br /><br />JHMerlin: The loan officer did not advice us properly and completely delayed the process by at least one full month by which time we changed to another bank. &nbsp;The lawyer most of the time did not care about our case and if it wasn&#039;t for her sweet secretary who was diligent, we would have fired her a long time ago. Seriously, this was one horrible lawyer who also delayed many things and hardly advocated in our behalf. Her response half of the time was &quot;call the realtor&quot; who is her friend. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;Your attorney&#039;s response to &quot;call the realtor&quot; is not inappropriate. &nbsp;In the purchase of a co-op the only reason to contact your attorney is below and the fee for the attorney is usually between 900 to 1,200 which is a nominal. &nbsp;<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Interview to retain services (important meeting)<br />2. &nbsp;Meeting to review the resale package of the co-op and/or sign the contract of sale (important meeting)<br />3. &nbsp;Phone call to advise if you have been board approved (secretary can handle this)<br />4. &nbsp;Attorney will contact you for closing date (secretary can handle this)<br /><br />I would add that any and all additional phone calls are handled through the attorney&#039;s assistant/secretary.<br /><br />JHMerlin: The realtor was another fake who said that she knew people in the building and can move things along and of course when the time came, she didn&#039;t know anything. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;It is possible that the realtor knows people in the building, but the only thing that the realtor can move along is the review of your board application and making sure it is accurate, and complete with the copies required for submission. &nbsp;Once that is done and sent to management, the realtor has no control over management and their delay if any. &nbsp;Once the application goes to the board, the realtor has no control over the board review process of your application either. &nbsp;The realtor as well assists you in answering questions that are relevant to the transaction. &nbsp;<br /><br />JHMerlin: So now after being 6 months in this purchase process, the board is taking almost two weeks to reply if we are accepted or not. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;Six months, minus one month with the bank that wasn&#039;t efficient. &nbsp;Not sure how long it took you to gather all the papers for the application, review and submit to the board. &nbsp;Not sure how long it took you to gather all documents for the bank and submit them.<br /><br />JHMerlin: It took them over a month from our board application submission for them to schedule an interview and now are taking more time that are causing lots of bank rate extension fees in our behalf. Is this usual for coops to take this long? <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;Not sure whether you are trying to say that it took management and the board over a month, but this is not uncommon. &nbsp;All board members must review the application. &nbsp;In addition, you lock in a rate for 45 days to 60 days and you should have gotten all relevant board application documents into management during that period. &nbsp;The timing of the lock-in is important, but due to your circumstances you can request they waive them. &nbsp;Not all banks are flexible though. <br /><br />JHMerlin: To make matters worse now the bank is asking for the 2009 financials which the coop doesn&#039;t have and alleges that it will take a few months for this to be available. Needless to say this overall is a nightmare. We are completely turned off by the coop and their delays. After pleading with the bank, they decided to accept the operating budget instead as long as we close by the end of the month. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;Corporate accountant may not have the 2009 financials yet. &nbsp;Banks will work with the operating budget and there shouldn&#039;t be a penalty for that. &nbsp;Not sure what the corporate financials and the close by end of month have to do with one another. &nbsp;Also note that due to the financial crisis that we are experiencing, banks are extremely cautious in their lending practices, and therefore although frustrating they want to make sure that they are lending to a corporation that is financially sound. &nbsp;This is not unheard of.<br /><br />JHMerlin: We told the board of this through their managing agent and apparently they don&#039;t care. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure why you are communicating with management. &nbsp;I instruct buyer&#039;s never to contact management and/or the boards. &nbsp;Realtors in the community usually take care of these calls only when absolutely necessary. <br /><br />JHMerlin: Not sure we want to live in a building who is so disconsiderate. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;The building may not be inconsiderate. &nbsp;Please understand that all real estate transactions are taking longer than usual these days. &nbsp;I understand that it is frustrating, but there is not one single person to blame. I now find myself feeling that you are unhappy with your realtor, banker, management, board and attorney. &nbsp;<br /><br />JHMerlin: So we are actually hoping that the board will deny us. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;Not sure how to respond, unless you are hoping that a board member is on this listserve and will read your request. &nbsp;If they do not deny you and you walk away from the contract of sale, it is my belief that the seller will be able to keep your deposition. &nbsp;But that is something that you must ask your attorney or his/her secretar.<br /><br />JHMerlin: We are mainly concerned how much we have to pay our uncaring lawyer from the original quote she gave us. Any input will be greatly appreciated. <br /><br />Response: &nbsp;As I indicated above, the attorneys within the community of Jackson Heights usually get paid at closing. &nbsp;The fee is nominal. &nbsp;I am not sure how many times you have contacted your attorney and for what purpose, but the reason why the attorney may not have always been available is that they don&#039;t have to be available at all times. &nbsp;Many buyer&#039;s communicate with their attorneys via email or via their secretary.<br /><br />Response/Conclusion:<br /><br />Purchasing a new home is frustrating and things don&#039;t always move smoothly. &nbsp;Even when they do, there is always a level of anxiety that can&#039;t be denied. &nbsp;<br /><br />It has been my experience that some buyer&#039;s become overbearing and nothing seems to work out. &nbsp;Then I have some buyer&#039;s that let everything flow, with some bumps along the way though.<br /><br />So I leave you with this. &nbsp;If you have contacted your attorney many times, although you do not have to pay them if you do not go to closing, a few 100 would be in order. &nbsp;Even though you say the attorney has been uncaring. &nbsp;His secretary on the other hand has not. &nbsp;And her time is worth a few dollars.<br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine the realtor not doing his/her to make this transaction work as realtors work on commission.<br /><br />The banker knows exactly what to do, but unfortunately the entire banking industry requires more paperwork and is not rushing to lend money unless they have all documents in order.<br /><br />Management of all buildings take their time in all real estate transaction board applications and unfortunately, your application is not the only one that is pending. &nbsp;<br /><br />Board members and/or the admission committees usually schedule interviews once a month in addition to scheduling the corporate board meetings as well. &nbsp;And of course every board member usually has a full time job as well, vacations, etc. which cause delays.<br /><br />Best to you!!</div>
