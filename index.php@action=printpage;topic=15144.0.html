				I&#039;m sorry to see that the large store with all the fun mannequins outside it is going out of business.&nbsp; There are two stores next to it, that are also vacant as well as a few across the street.&nbsp; They have for months now.&nbsp; I have a sinking feeling we&#039;ll only get more chain outlet stores to replace them because they&#039;re the only ones who can afford the high rents.&nbsp; The interesting thing to note is the tacit acknowledgement of these chains that the area cannot afford these high prices so they only put outlets out here, but since they are chains they can afford the rent.&nbsp; &nbsp;The mannequin store brought 82nd Street character and I&#039;m sad to see it go.&nbsp; But I have watched it happen all over Manhattan, and then Astoria, and now I&#039;ll watch it happen here.&nbsp; Vanishing NY indeed.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m not entirely following what you mean when you say the area can&#039;t afford these chains, so only outlets go in. Do you think JH can&#039;t support a Gap, and that&#039;s why a Gap Outlet went in? Ditto for Banana Republic (which owns Gaps)? The Skechers isn&#039;t an outlet store is it? (Outlets sell product that&#039;s made specifically for the Outlet).

				Sketchers is an outlet.&nbsp; And yes, I do think there are a lot of people living here who could not afford the higher Banana Republic prices but can afford the outlet prices.&nbsp; I think the Carter&#039;s is an outlet too.&nbsp; I am one of those people who can&#039;t afford the high prices.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saddened to find local businesses put out due to high rents prices, only to find chains moving in.&nbsp; And I think it says something if they realize a store with 5th Avenue prices isn&#039;t going to do as well as an outlet would.&nbsp; The local businesses do have business.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like no one was buying their clothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;They go out of business due to rent hikes.&nbsp; I know it happens everywhere.&nbsp; I&#039;m just saddened by it, that&#039;s all.

				Banana Republic isn&#039;t really a 5th Avenue priced store though, not withstanding that there is a Banana Republic on 5th Avenue at Rockefeller Center. :) It&#039;s the upscale brand for Gap Inc., but Gap is&nbsp; targeting middle class folk. You won&#039;t find $500 tops at BR, which is what I think of when I think of a Fifth Avenue store (i.e. Bergdorf&#039;s), but you will find reasonably affordable clothing that has decent quality (i.e. skirts and pants that are lined, for example). <br /><br />I recall seeing a Census breakdown block by block awhile back that showed that the average income in the historic district was a bit higher than outside the historic district (I can&#039;t find it now though, sorry), so I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s accurate to say JH can&#039;t afford middle class brands. But it is a bummer to see national brands taking over the space local stores can no longer afford.<br /><br />

Sure it&#039;s going to cost you and arm and a leg if you&#039;re replacing your entire wardrobe (and really good incentive to maintain our weight!) all at once, but if you&#039;re picking up a couple of pieces every season to replace what has worn out, it&#039;s pretty reasonable for the quality.

				I really can&#039;t afford to shop at Banana Republic and I don&#039;t know where the lines of the historic district lie.&nbsp; I still think there are a certain amount of people who live near Roosevelt Avenue and in Elmhurst and Corona as well as Jackson Heights that most of the local businesses here price their merchandise towards.&nbsp; I did find it interesting that only outlets are moving in on 82nd.&nbsp; I think what I&#039;m getting at is that as more landlords start hiking up rents we are going to see an influx of chains, and local businesses will disappear.&nbsp; That is mostly what I lament and I will miss the character of Jackson Heights in this sense.&nbsp; When everything looks the same and chains are everywhere, I have to say it&#039;s a bit boring and it is sad and I do feel sorry for those of us who will eventually be priced out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of where one can sustain a local business, where we can shop and where we can live.

For what it&#039;s worth, I think that clothing store (which seem to feature nothing that is made with natural fibers) took over for KB Toys. So for a little while at least a small store took over a space that had been a national chain.<br /><br />As an aside, I remember being able to find cheap cotton clothing 20 years ago in clothing stores. Today, the only thing cotton I ever seem to find are mumus. In hot weather, who wants to wrap themselves in polyester and rayon?

				I agree that there&#039;s a certain loss if 82nd Street becomes all national chains, but it&#039;s not something that I personally will cry over.<br /><br />This is just my little opinion, but many of the stores that have left 82nd Street, and some that are still there, just don&#039;t sell anything that I would be interested in purchasing.&nbsp; The store that the original poster speaks of is one of them.&nbsp; I personally like the fact that BR opened, even if it&#039;s an outlet.&nbsp; I know that if I need a shirt at the last minute, I can duck in there and get something of good quality for a good price in a store that is well organized and designed.&nbsp; Call me picky, but part of the shopping experience is having a welcoming environment and many stores in our neighborhood are poorly planned, have little space to move around in and generally speaking, don&#039;t eliminate inventory that just does not sell - making a crowded store even more crowded. <br /><br />I grew up in Astoria.&nbsp; There were mom and pop stores all over, and there still are a few left (and some that open all the time).&nbsp; Some of the stores that closed are missed, but that&#039;s because they actually were well stocked, nicely planned out, and had sales people that knew what they were doing.&nbsp; If these little stores were the same, I would agree that I would miss them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d like to say that some of the stuff carried is generally cheap, but as anyone that walks into UNIQLO can attest to, cheap clothes can be sold in a location that actually looks good and inviting.&nbsp;

				A light cotton top, skirt or summer dress is wonderfully breathable for the summer. Linen is better, but it wrinkles. I&#039;d also be happy with a cotton blend.<br /><br />I stopped in both BR &amp; Gap Factory today looking for something to wear to a meeting in the city that was good for warm weather commuting. BR was fine - clothing was organized, the store was clean, etc. The Gap looked like a tornado had just blown through it. (I didn&#039;t find anything by the way. Looks like the summer stuff is beginning to be cycled out and the fall items are coming it)

				who the heck buys shorts at Banana Republic? Seriously, shorts aren&#039;t even remotely upscale, and BR is an upscale brand for middle class people. <br /><br />Maybe someone making $100K (and in NYC, that&#039;s middle class) with no kids can&#039;t be bothered to walk across the mall to the Gap or Old Navy to get shorts, but add a couple kids to the mix, and that same person with the big salary would have a good reason to get him or herself to a downscale brand more in line with what shorts are: casual clothes non rich folks don&#039;t spend $60 bucks on at the place they buy their office clothes.

				Yeah, no one is buying their shorts there. But BR is kind of office wear for the middle class once you pay off your student loans and can take a step up from Old Navy. (Rich people pay way more than $50 a shirt on sale). You don&#039;t buy a whole wardrobe at once. You buy two shirts, a pair of pants, and a sweater a year. That doesn&#039;t cost an arm and a leg.

				Also depends on what your priorities are. I&#039;m middle class and sometimes spend 60 to 80 bucks on a shirt if I love it....but not from BR ....I don&#039;t think the quality is so great. I have friends who make a hell of a lot more than me and haven&#039;t bought clothing since 1963.

I&#039;m not saying that means that JH can support a Banana Republic, but I do think many people actually mean lower middle class when they call something middle class.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i&#039;d say in NYC 112k isn&#039;t enough to buy $60 shirts regularly. but then i&#039;m more careful with money than most and like to save for security over possessions. <br /><br />But i think we&#039;re talking two different things here, i have purchased shirts over $60 in the past, but not regularly. I think for a place like BR (not outlet) to survive it would need people that shop there regularly, not just casually buy a shirt here and there.<br /><br />i also think our generation looks for quantity over quality, while it may be true that you get what you pay for, I think we live in a much more &quot;cheap and disposable&quot; time now.<br /><br />certainly though the average income in JH would be much lower than 112k<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				If anyone is interested in actual data from the Census, check out this break down of Median Household income block by block. https://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nation/#13/40.7558/-73.8516 (https://project.wnyc.org/median-income-nation/#13/40.7558/-73.8516) The blocks surrounding 82nd Street have a median household income of $67K. To the east and west the median household income drops. The historic district is comparable to large chunks of Astoria, Sunnyside, and Woodside.<br /><br />It&#039;s important to keep in mind a couple of things. 1/2 of households earn above the median, and 1/2 earn below the median. This also doesn&#039;t tell you anything about the household - number of people in it, number of wage earners, age, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to point out again a wage earner pulling in $112K a year with no kids is in a very different financial situation than a wager earner pulling in $112K a year with a couple of kids to clothe, feed, save for college, and provide enrichment opportunities like dance classes. <br /><br />Priorities vary, but I can tell you having worked in an office with people who earn anywhere between $40-$120K for full time work, BR is well represented.

				The larger point that BR sells styles from this decade. I&#039;d be happy to spend my middle class income at a non-chain retailer if they sold slim-fit shirts. My wife isn&#039;t asking for much either: Jeans without rhinestones, say.

				I miss the Hallmark store and the toy store from about 10 years ago. Also miss the irish bar, Buds and also Cavalier...whatever hard times they had, we&#039;re in a better place economically now. Wish they&#039;d come back.

The easiest thing to do is to use a 40% off regular price coupon and stack a 11% discounted gift card off Cardpool. I usually pick up things closer to 70%+ off from BR by buying online and stacking codes, discounted gift cards, cashback sites, etc.

				I chuckled at the idea of the difficulty of finding jeans in JH that aren&#039;t bedazzled in rhinestones. The Gap and BR Factory stores really do fill a need in the neighborhood. The women&#039;s clothing options are limited to the women&#039;s clothing store next to Table Wine which seems to be more matronly clothing, the cheapo clothing stores that sell product you know is going to start to fall apart and pill after only a couple of washes, and the Gap &amp; BR Factory Stores.<br /><br />I stopped in the women&#039;s store going out of business on 82nd St. just to see if there was anything in there worth buying. There wasn&#039;t. If I was still 20, I might have considered one or two cotton/rayon blend t-shirts, but those sizes are for juniors, where size 8 is a large. Everything else was all polyester and rayon clothing that I always suspect will melt on your skin during a heat wave. (Most of the clothing is also a style would never have appealed to me even during my younger, clubbing days.)

				The clothing store that Sketchers replaced did sell jeans, sneakers, and non-clubby clothing, but that went under too, due to high rents.&nbsp; There are at least 4 empty storefronts on 82nd at the moment.&nbsp; 2 that have sat empty for months now.&nbsp; I agree that the Gap usually looks like a tornado hit it.&nbsp; Much like the Old Navy in Rego Park.&nbsp; Bye bye, mannequin store.&nbsp; I admit I didn&#039;t shop at your store either.&nbsp; But you were a source of amusement and fun on the way to the train in the morning, and you will be sorely missed.&nbsp; It&#039;ll all be ok guys.&nbsp; Sorry for the lamentation.&nbsp; But have a great weekend!

				As someone who aged out of jeans and sneakers on my down time a long time ago, I just wish there were some local stores that offered options for the 30-50 something who doesn&#039;t like to dress like a teenager or like a retiree. There isn&#039;t, so when I need some new clothes and don&#039;t want to leave the neighborhood, at least BR Factory is around.

				It looks like that group of empty stores along the West side of the 82nd street is being renovated.&nbsp; So it seems like the closings were more about the landlord wanting to renovate rather than the businesses not doing well.&nbsp; Any clues about what will be going in?

				Captain Flannel- <br /><br />There is that nice dress shop somewhere near table wine. Have you ever gone in? They also have casual clothes. They are so nice and have a good selection.Plus, it&#039;s the kind of business we would like to keep.
