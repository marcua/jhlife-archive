					Thanks everyone for the replies.<br /><br />We actually like our hardwood floor, but now is mostly covered, guess not much to enjoy anymore. We have added those extra thick felt pads under all the rugs, but somehow my kid will always find the spot without the rug and then stump on the floor loudly when she get frustrated, I guess she wants that loud feedback.<br /><br />It seem like most coop have similar issue with the sound vertically. We didn&#039;t think of replacing the floor and add soundproofing underneath, but I guess that is option to explore, will have to ask the management and super see if they know anyone in my building did that.<br /><br />All the new place we looked at will add around $500 to $1000 more a month to what we paying now, and all depend on how much we sell our current place. But most have that second bathroom, which is nice to have.<br />

					I am in opposite boat as the Noisy Upstairs Neighbor thread. My 1.5yr old toddler getting constant complaint from our neighbor downstair. As she sometime get frustrated, then start to scream sharply and stump on the floor continuously. Even her walking seem to get complaint from downstair neighbor. And to the point it went to management, but we met all the house rule, and we also constantly getting harass that we too loud, them yelling up or coming up and yell through our door.<br /><br />Is getting stressful to deal with this and also stressful to constantly stop my toddler to do her normal activities. So we are looking to move to another coop, not sure if that is the right move or we will end up the same, is our first kid so this might be issue again if we plan to have a second.<br /><br />So anyone live in Hawthorne Court, Greystone and Washington Plaza can provide some feedback regarding how good the building sound proof is. My current complex, when I walk barefoot my wife can hear the stump noise in the other room and sometime we can hear our neighbor downstair talking.<br /><br />

That happen to Fox5 channel and PBS13 on my TV, after I reprogram somehow my TV get two digital channels of the same number, so I suppress the old one.<br /><br />There was some service announcement on the need to reprogram, can&#039;t remember where I read it, think it was either last Oct. or last last Oct.

					For the past month, there been a Census worker coming to my building every Sunday evening to ask about follow up. The guy said is for Census control, even though I told him I already complete mine back in June.<br /><br />My first encounter, he said just few quick follow up questions, I agreed to it, but eventually it end up being the same Census questions I answered online, which at that point I stop the guy and said I already fill out the exact questions. So I told him to stop.<br /><br />Afterward, they been coming every Sunday evening. At one point I even give them the confirmation code from the Census I completed, but they still insist asking me the same questions.<br /><br />Does anyone encounter similar situation? Are they doing control to make sure my answers is consistent?<br />

					I just took the survey. You can just do the line you took most frequent and then skip the rest of the line or buses. I did one subway line and one bus.<br /><br />Is not that slow, at least when I did it on my laptop, it take a few minutes to load afterward is not too bad. The questions are long and some are repetitive, I guess they try to see if you are consistent with your answer. Hope it will give them some feedback.<br /><br />Only thing I am surprise is how MTA got a hold of my email, as I never use or signup any MTA services or newsletter.

					Think OP have good intention, but yes please don&#039;t do this in Yelp, as they are horrible company that bully business to pay them if restaurant owner don&#039;t want to show bad review on top.<br /><br />Why not work with local leader or health department, see if we can create some sort of free COVID safe training program for restaurant owner, and in return they get some sort of sticker or paper to display on their window, it will certain give some assurance for those scare to dine out. <br />But then again our government is so bad that we don&#039;t have any study on what is proper way to handle restaurant safety for COVID. There also a lot of factor that need to be address that are outside of the restaurant, for example food suppliers.

					I don&#039;t get what is the purpose of these zone. How does it prevent anyone from red zone to just walk few blocks down and dine in the restaurant. Or take subway few stops to hit the gym or get a haircut. Is the purpose just to make people in red zone inconvenience.

I am not against them, I am saying we should do something to make it better for everyone, especially those complaint about closure. Maybe something similar to Zipcar spot, section some spot off on few street for standing delivery vehicle only. It seem like most of the congestion occurs 74 to mid 80s, so maybe we restrict no parking on one side during certain hours, so similar to Northern where no parking during rush hour.

					I also noticed the new sign last week, when I past by.<br /><br />I tried Bombay Kitchen before the lock down, they were just open (after they remodel and change the name). They were very dis-organize, but the food was good (similar to Kati Roti Company in midtown but half the price) and limit set of sweet.

					Do we have to use the one near by for early voting? Last year I went to the one in Kew Garden, I would like to go to that one if possible. Reason I prefer that one is large, so more space for social distancing.<br /><br />I looked at the ballot, any one have more info with all the candidates for the Justice and Judge, or where to look for more info.

					Ummm I am not aware there is a petition, I will sign up. But yeah, I think we should at least keep it close on the weekend for start.<br /><br />I think we just not tackle this smartly, 35th ave should be enforce to no double park during certain hours or no parking during certain hours to speed up the flow. Every time I see a UPS, Fedex or FreshDirect or any other truck double park the whole traffic is backed up.<br /><br />I am also one of those as described here, that I bough a car during this lock down. I own a car for over 10+ years, then last 4 years I went car free. Parking does seem a lot tougher, but I don&#039;t think 35th ave traffic are as bad as what it is before 34th closure, or other post about Northern Ave, as it is always bad even before lock down.<br /><br />I am also noticing a lot people moving out as well, at least in my building 4 of my neighbor already move out and selling or sold their apartment already.
