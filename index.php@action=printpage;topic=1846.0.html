				Which buffet is your favorite?&nbsp; Any kind of food..&nbsp; I love going to buffets by myself, because you get your food instantly, and can try a variety of dishes.&nbsp; So far, I&#039;ve only been to the Maharaja buffet around here (vegetarian Indian), and it&#039;s very good.

I went inside only once to pay for a cassette I saw displayed outside. The place was so tiny, and so much of it was devoted to sweets and audio/video, that I canâ€™t imagine where the buffet would be. My favorites in the South and Central Asian department are Nanking Express on weekends, al-Naimat and Indian Taj every other day. Jackson Diner is very good but certainly not the best. I tried Mehfil, and I wasnâ€™t particularly impressed. I returned to Delhi Palace, and I disliked it enough I doubt Iâ€™ll return (at least not for the buffet).<br /><br />In the East Asian department, the Top-of-the-World buffet in Woodside is okay but not better than the ones I used to frequent in the Bronx. That said, it is <em>far</em> better than the one in Long Island City near Stop and Shop. East in Elmhurst is probably the best, but its prices and atmosphere have prevented me from trying it yet because I idiotically feel like I need an occasion (more than simply â€œItâ€™s carbohydrate day!â€). Any all-you-can-eat Chinese-style buffets in Jackson Heights proper?

				Wow, great info..&nbsp; I was wondering about Top of the World, because I&#039;ve been walking to 61st to take the 7 Express train in the mornings and I pass it.<br /><br />Sounds like there is a consensus on al naimet, so I think I&#039;ll try that first.&nbsp; Where is it?<br /><br />As far as I know, no Chinese buffets in JH, but I have off from work for the next 2 weeks and plan to walk around everywhere, so I&#039;ll keep an eye out for one.&nbsp; If not that, at least nearby.

				raja, the one with the cassettes on the corner, they have an AYCE, but not a proper buffet. you just go up to the people serving teh food and like oliver twist you say &#039;can I have some more???&#039;<br />they are really nice actualy. very motherly. and all vegetarian so don&#039;t worry about those carbs. <br /><br />al naimet is right across from commerce now TD waterhouse bank. it looks like a sweet shop, but go further backwards and you will find the buffet.

				The Himalayan Yak weekend buffet lunch for $10 is my favorite right now. There&#039;s rice with about 6 dishes (chicken, veggies, goat), naan, tea and dessert. I got to try butter tea for the first time at their buffet. The naan is heavenly.

				I passed by Yak&#039;s buffet today - It looked really good! it seemed more like indian style, i basically recognized everything. ehh, almost. <br />the biryani rice looked great and they had chilly pork which looked like it diddnt belong on a buffet. and they had a big tray full of those fried cheese balls soaked in sugar water - my fav.

So far as I know, only three South Asian restaurants have a self-service, all-one-can-eat buffet <em>at all times</em>: Indian Taj, Maharaja and al-Naimat. (We used to have at least four, but Ashoka closed, and its replacement Thakali Kitchen now only has a weekend lunch buffet, which pales in comparison to their standard menu.)

I want to try it. For the record, I did not write I could not find a Himalayan thread, but that I could not find an existing thread in which to discuss <em>both</em> subcontinent and Himalayan cuisine, as well as different restaurants with buffets, steam tables and table service, as I was doing. I chose the South Asian thread because the majority of the venues I mentioned served that cuisine.<br /><br />I would not quite describe Top of the Worldâ€™s offerings as â€œeverything goes,â€ but perhaps thatâ€™s because of my great familiarity with the all-you-can-eat Chinese-American buffet concept from my overindulgence at numerous good venues in and around the northeast Bronx. East Manor in Elmhurst has a wider selection of items, but the quality did not at all impress me. TW had much of what the Bronx places had, including many Western items like pizza, but with a more limited selection and some additional Tibetan items like their incredible hot sauce. They stopped offering sushi months ago, so there was nothing Japanese remaining unless you include the chicken pieces on skewers in imitation of teriyaki chicken. Still, it was probably better than EM as well as closer and cheaper. On Monday, however, Potala was identical to TW with the exception of new management and staff who havenâ€™t yet figured out how to do their jobs (exemplified by the signs on the buffet being in the old TW positions and thus bearing no relation to the food underneath them), an even more limited selection (no beef ribs, as a fellow customer pointed out), and an under-heated dining room so cold I was pulling my sleeves over my hands to keep warm and my food would become unacceptably cold before I could finish it. Perhaps as some sort of compensation, the manager was annoyingly friendly and intrusive. When I dropped a bag I was holding, he rushed to bend down and pick it up for me, and when I was at the buffet, he interrupted my flow of food acquisition to describe the different dumplings at length as if Iâ€™d never been there before. After an experience like that, I will probably try EM again before returning to Potala, or maybe even endure the hour-and-a-half trip up to Baychester.

				I gave Mehfilâ€™s buffet another try and found they had expanded it since last I had eaten there, including more low-carbohydrate (or so I interpreted them) foods. I really enjoyed it, especially the fish curry, quite a treat at a buffet. I also returned to Potala and found they too had improved to a point about the same as that at which Top of the World had been.

				I tried Mehfil&#039;s buffet today and it was delicious!&nbsp; They had pakora, palak paneer, yellow dal, a dish that looked like it was potato, but was actually squash, a zucchini dish, a chickpea dish and I forget the name of the dish, but it had kidney beans.&nbsp; They also had a good assortment of condiments, including mango chutney (my favorite!).&nbsp; I saw the meat curry dishes, but didn&#039;t try them since I don&#039;t eat meat.&nbsp; Rice pudding for dessert.&nbsp; They also bring naan and water to the table.&nbsp; They asked me what I wanted to drink, and I just said water.&nbsp; So, I&#039;m not sure what is included with the buffet.<br /><br />Side question:&nbsp; What are you supposed to do with raita?&nbsp; It&#039;s always served when I order indian food, but since the food is already creamy, I do not know what to do with it.&nbsp; Mehfil had it at their buffet also.<br /><br />Service was very good (they continually filled my water glass and brought the bread/check without my having to ask and cleared plates right away).&nbsp; The manager/owner (not sure?) was also asking everyone how their meals were.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad to say there was a decent crowd in there on a Monday at 2pm, but maybe they just all had off from work today like me.&nbsp; I hope they stay busy, as I think this is my new favorite buffet.

				Planning to go to Delhi Palace for buffet, but noticed Delhi Heights started offering buffet.&nbsp; I had been wanting to try this place.<br />The atmosphere, food presentation and quality beat Delhi Palace and Jackson Diner.&nbsp; Even better it was a dollar cheaper then the other two.<br />It&#039;s more comfortable and has a nice bar.&nbsp; Food selection varied a lot with good pakoras to start, tandoori chicken and biryani very tasty and a great selection of vegetarian dishes including a manchurian style cauliflower.&nbsp; Will definitely go back.&nbsp; Want to try Menfil as well...since it gets a lot of attention on JHL.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P&nbsp; &nbsp;Tasty!!!&nbsp;

				yep, u can dip your naan bread into raita or you can just spoon it into your mouth (my way&nbsp; &nbsp;;D).&nbsp; either way, cucumber with yogurt is delish and a great way to cool your palate from some of the spices in the other dishes.&nbsp;
