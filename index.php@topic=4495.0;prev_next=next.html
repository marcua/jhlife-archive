								<div class="inner" id="msg_30040"><div align="center">Senator Peralta joins Senator Klein, Chair of the Task Force on Government Efficiency Unveiling&nbsp; Millions in Potential Savings<br /></div><br />ALBANY, NY â€“ The Senateâ€™s Task Force on Government Efficiency, chaired by State Senator and Deputy Majority Leader Jeff Klein, released an investigative report citing $60 million dollars in potential cost-savings at the NYS Department of Transportation (DOT), and more than $200 million in funds the Department has already wasted, at a press conference in Albany on Tuesday. The report is the third in a series of investigations into state agency spending by the Task Force. The Task Force also announced on Tuesday that it will hold a hearing to probe DOT on its wasteful spending practices on Wednesday, April 28th.&nbsp; <br /><br />â€œItâ€™s time to get smart about spending and stop throwing money out the window. DOT should know they have an obligation to ensure safety, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean a right to excessive spending. We need to grab the reins and get things moving in the right direction so that we can ensure that taxpayer dollars are being put to good use for years to come,â€ said State Senator and Deputy Majority Leader Jeffrey D. Klein (D-Bronx/Westchester).<br /><br />In its latest report, the Task Force uncovered close to $60 million in potential cost-saving measures at DOT, ranging from moving some of its contracted services in-house ($46.5 million) to speeding up its typical contract close-out time frame ($10 million) to decreasing overtime spending ($3.5 million) or cutting back on night work ($360,000).<br /><br />Senator Peralta said â€œWhile my constituents in the 13th district are dealing with crumbling bridges, decaying highways and a host of other infrastructure issues, someone at the Department of Transportation thought the best use of taxpayer money was to buy $27 million dollars worth of new road signs.&nbsp; This latest display of government waste is nothing short of abuse public monies and taxpayers should be outraged.â€&nbsp; &nbsp;Peralta continued â€œWe are facing a $9 billion dollar deficit as a result of years of out of control spending, inefficiencies in government and fiscal mismanagement.&nbsp; We cannot continue the practice of balancing the stateâ€™s budget on the backs of hard working men and women while turning a blind eye to bloated budgets and redundancies in government agencies.â€<br /><br />&nbsp;The Task Force report also outlined more than $210 million in wasted funds that have already been spent, including $150 million on contract management and further rising contract costs associated with changes in DOT specifications. In 2006, DOT revised its specifications for the type of reflective sheeting used on orange construction signs, requiring full compliance by January 2009. Although DOT claimed this change would come at no cost to the state, contractors statewide had to pay nearly $27 million to replace the 2.7 million existing signs, a cost they are now passing onto the state in the form of higher contract prices.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The report found that DOT has implemented the same wasteful practice by recently revising specifications for temporary concrete barriers used at construction sites. In February 2007, DOT released revised specifications for the manufacturing of these commonplace barriers, requiring that they be replaced with barriers meeting a new set of standards by 2015. At an average cost of $36 per foot, per barrier, it is going to cost the construction industry statewide an estimated $33.5 million to meet this benchmark, a cost that once again contractors are passing onto the state in higher contract prices.<br /><br />&nbsp;In an effort to stem further wasteful spending and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars at state agencies, the Senate Task Force announced the launch of a new webpage on Monday where state employees and other interested New Yorkers can anonymously submit their ideas, suggestions and feedback on how the state can conserve resources in this tough fiscal time, as well as to report any suspected wasteful government spending or abuse of tax dollars. This page is accessible via the Task Forceâ€™s Senate website: <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/committee/task-force-government-efficiency" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nysenate.gov/committee/task-force-government-efficiency</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Senate Task Force on Government Efficiency was created with the goal of uncovering inefficient government spending and developing productive solutions to put taxpayer dollars to better use. Chaired by State Senator and Deputy Majority Leader Jeff Klein, this bipartisan Task Force was formally announced in March of 2010. It is comprised of Senators Darrel Aubertine, Brian X. Foley, Craig Johnson, Betty Little, George Maziarz, Tom Morahan, Jose Peralta, Diane Savino, Jose Serrano, Bill Stachowski, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and David Valesky.<br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"></span></div>

It is incumbent upon us to make Earth Day a reminder for what is left undone, and commit ourselves every day of the year to a safer and more vibrant environment,â€ Senator Peralta said.&nbsp; â€œTo commemorate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, Iâ€™m very pleased to have helped the Senate Majority pass comprehensive environmental reforms which remove toxins from baby bottles, launch rechargeable battery and e-waste recycling programs, and limit the use of chemicals on school grounds and at day care centers.â€ <br />Bills in the package include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S3296-G / Prohibits the manufacture, distribution and sale of child care products such as pacifiers, bottles and sippy cups that contain Bisphenol. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S6047A / Establishes a comprehensive State-wide electronic equipment reuse and recycling program. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S5119 / Reduces the Stateâ€™s waste by prohibiting the purchase and use of non-recyclable paper/mailing products. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S4983C / Limits pesticide exposures for school and daycare aged children by prohibiting certain outdoor, non-essential applications on playgrounds, turf, and athletic or playing fields. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S3593 / Institutes a rechargeable battery producer and retailer sponsored take back program at no costs to consumers. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S6141B / Requires Auto Dealerships to post a Gallons Per Mile Fuel Savings Guide within the dealership that presents information developed by the DEC. <br />Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S3788C / Creates a cancer mapping program that overlays reported incidences of cancer with environmental facilities. <br />&nbsp;<br />Earth Day was started by Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson in 1970 when he held a nationwide grassroots demonstration on behalf of the environment to give the American people a forum to express their concern about what was happening to the land, rivers, lakes, and air.&nbsp; Twenty million demonstrators and thousands of schools and local communities participated.&nbsp; <br />Four decades later, nearly every community across the state commemorates Earth Day.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_30155"><img src="http://" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />(Albany, NY)-&nbsp; Following the controversial signing in Arizona of the nation&#039;s harshest anti-immigration law, Senators Jose Peralta (D-Queens) and JosÃ© M. Serrano (D-Manhattan/Bronx) and, and their Senate colleagues, held&nbsp; a press conference today to denounce the new law, and to call for immediate, comprehensive immigration reform. SB 1070, which was signed into law by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, on Friday, April 23rd, requires law enforcement to question people regarding their immigration status and to arrest individuals if there is &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that they are in the country illegally. <br /><br />&nbsp;â€œAs a Dominican American who represents one of the most diverse communities in this country, I find Arizonaâ€™s SB1070 anti-immigrant, anti-American and unconstitutional,â€ said Senator Jose Peralta.&nbsp; â€œThis bill does not address comprehensive immigration reform; instead it will restrict civil rights and further marginalize immigrant communities. We cannot allow any governing body in this country to legalize what is nothing short of racial profiling.&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;â€œEvery immigrant family should have the opportunity to undergo the citizenship process in a secure environment,â€ said Senator JosÃ© M. Serrano, who has been at the forefront of the fight for immigrant rights in his district, and has spearheaded the East Harlem Against Deportation Initiative. â€œThe Arizona law places a divisive wedge between local law enforcement and the immigrant population, and what is more troubling, is that it embraces racial profiling as a tool for harassment. Any law that undermines the civil rights of any particular group is reprehensible and should not be tolerated- especially in a country that once served as a safe haven for those persecuted for their heritage and beliefs.â€<br /><br />He continued, â€œI represent a district with a vibrant and hardworking immigrant population, and have seen the positive effect that immigrants have on our communities and our economy.&nbsp; This regrettable law should serve as a wake-up call for the federal government to act now on the issue of comprehensive immigration reform, so that this oppressive law does not set the tone for immigration laws in New York and throughout the nation.â€<br /><br />&nbsp;â€œArizonaâ€™s new immigration law is unconstitutional and offensive,â€ Senate President Pro Tempore Malcolm A. Smith said.&nbsp; â€œRequiring law enforcement officials to question individuals about their immigration status based on â€˜reasonable suspicionâ€™ predicated on the color of their skin is outrageous and unacceptable.&nbsp; I have worked long and hard to protect the rights of all people regardless of race, religion or gender and I will add my voice now to oppose this archaic new law.â€<br /><br />&quot;I stand in solidarity with the civil rights leaders who oppose Arizona&#039;s unconstitutional racial profiling law,â€ said Senator Eric T. Schneiderman (D-Manhattan/Bronx). â€œGiving local police the power to profile and arrest people who cannot prove their immigration status on demand is as radical as it is irresponsible. This is a wakeup call for the federal government to deliver comprehensive immigration reform that will undo this moral, economic and law enforcement disaster, and prevent another state from following Arizonaâ€™s lead. There is no reason we cannot secure our borders and protect the civil rights of everyone living in this country.&quot;<br /><br />The legislators stressed that the law, which has been criticized by President Barack Obama, underscores the need for federal, state, and local governments to enact immigration policies that will provide a clear path to citizenship, while safeguarding the civil and human rights of families and individuals throughout the country. <br /><br />Aside from authorizing social profiling, the law also makes it a state crime to not carry immigration papers, and allows people to sue their local government and government agencies if they believe that immigration laws are not being enforced.<br /><br />Serrano and Peralta also presented a Senate Resolution, which will be voted on by the Senate, denouncing any policy of profiling in New York State, and urging the federal government to denounce any state-sanctioned immigration policy similar to Arizona&#039;s law, which has outraged immigrant&#039;s rights groups. <br /><br />â€œIâ€™m proud today to join with our state officials in saying: We are New York! We are not Arizona,â€ said Chung-Wha Hong from the New York Immigration Coalition. â€œBetter yet, letâ€™s all of usâ€”New Yorkers, Arizonans, Americans, immigrant and native-bornâ€” use the debacle that is the Arizona law as a resounding call to step up the pressure on Washington to fix our immigration system.&nbsp; Get out there on May 1st and make sure our leaders deliver the change that our nation demands.â€<br /><br />Angela Fernandez, Executive Director at the Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights said, â€œWe at NMCIR are alarmed by and condemn Arizonaâ€™s passage of the most retrograde anti-immigration bill this country has ever seen. For the first time, in the US, an individual can be stopped and asked for their â€œpapersâ€ based on a police officerâ€™s â€œhunchâ€ around someoneâ€™s immigration status.&nbsp; This is too reminiscent of an era we thought we left behind generations ago.&nbsp; If the individual in question cannot produce documentation proving residency, they can be detained and deported with no opportunity to defend themselves.&nbsp; Yet, we are not surprised by this law, as it is the extreme outgrowth of an already dangerous and disastrous effort by the federal government to partner with local officials to deport immigrants.&nbsp; We hope that President Obama puts an immediate stop to Arizonaâ€™s immoral and unconstitutional law and that he put an end to all partnerships between DHS and local law enforcement.â€<br /><br />&quot;Inaction on the part of the federal government only enables the continued the exploitation of vulnerable workers, the separation of families, and the promotion of misguided policies at the local and state levels. The time to fix the broken immigration system is now. We applaud State Senators Serrano and Peralta for introducing a resolution that highlights all the contributions that immigrants have made to make New York State great,&quot; said Ana Maria Archila, Co-Executive Director of Make the Road New York.â€<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_30436">Task Force Reveals Whistleblower Website Tip; Probes Officials on Wasteful Spending&nbsp; <br /><br />ALBANY, NY â€“ Senator Jose Peralta and The Senateâ€™s Task Force on Government Efficiency unveiled a recent tip submitted to the Task Force whistleblower website regarding suspicious overtime pay at the NYS Department of Transportation (DOT) at a press conference in Albany on Wednesday. Immediately following the press conference, the Task Force held a public forum to probe DOT officials on this issue and other potential findings of excessive spending. <br /><br />&nbsp;Late last month, the Task Force released the third in its series of investigative reports, this one citing $60 million dollars in potential cost-savings at the NYS Department of Transportation, and more than $200 million in funds the Department has already wasted. Following the release of the report, the Task Force received an anonymous tip on its whistleblower website that DOTâ€™s motor vehicle inspectors, 7 of whom fall into the top 10 overtime earners overall at the Department, may be inspecting vehicles not required to be inspected under NYS transportation law. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />â€œWe are facing extraordinary budgetary challenges this year and we cannot afford to have any agency or individual waste tax dollars by racking up excessive overtime, mismanagement of projects or incompetence.&nbsp; I applaud the individual who came forward and reported this misuse of government resources.&nbsp; We cannot continue the practice of balancing the stateâ€™s budget on the backs of hard working men and women while turning a blind eye to blatant abuses of public moniesâ€ said State Senator Jose Peralta (D-Queens).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />At the hearing, the Task Force heard testimony from DOT Acting Commissioner Stanley Gee; Tom Comanzo, Vice President of the Public Employees Federation (PEF); and Jay Simson, Executive Director of American Council on Engineering Companies.<br /><br />In its latest report, the Task Force uncovered close to $60 million in potential cost-saving measures at DOT, ranging from moving some of its contracted services in-house ($46.5 million) to speeding up its typical contract close-out time frame ($10 million) to decreasing overtime spending ($3.5 million) or cutting back on night work ($360,000).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Task Force report also outlined more than $210 million in wasted funds that have already been spent, including $150 million on contract management and further rising contract costs associated with changes in DOT specifications. In 2006, DOT revised its specifications for the type of reflective sheeting used on orange construction signs, requiring full compliance by January 2009. Although DOT claimed this change would come at no cost to the state, contractors statewide had to pay nearly $27 million to replace the 2.7 million existing signs, a cost they are now passing onto the state in the form of higher contract prices.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;In an effort to stem further wasteful spending and mismanagement of taxpayer dollars at state agencies, last month the Senate Task Force announced the launch of a new webpage where state employees and other interested New Yorkers can anonymously submit their ideas, suggestions and feedback on how the state can conserve resources in this tough fiscal time, as well as to report any suspected wasteful government spending or abuse of tax dollars. This page is accessible via the Task Forceâ€™s Senate website: <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/committee/task-force-government-efficiency" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nysenate.gov/committee/task-force-government-efficiency</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Senate Task Force on Government Efficiency was created with the goal of uncovering inefficient government spending and developing productive solutions to put taxpayer dollars to better use. Chaired by State Senator and Deputy Majority Leader Jeff Klein, this bipartisan Task Force was formally announced in March of 2010. It is comprised of Senators Darrel Aubertine, Brian X. Foley, Craig Johnson, Betty Little, George Maziarz, Tom Morahan, Jose Peralta, Diane Savino, Jose Serrano, Bill Stachowski, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and David Valesky.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_30514">State Senator JosÃ© Peralta, State Senator Diane Savino , State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky and Assembly member Jeff Aubry <img src="http://Call for Passage of the Wage Theft Prevention Act" alt="" class="bbc_img" /> <br />(Queens, NY)- State Senator JosÃ© Peralta, joined by State Senator Diane Savino, State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky., Assembly member Jeff Aubry, Make the Road New York, The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 are calling for the passage of the The Wage Theft Prevention Act, S7050 (Savino), A10163( Heastie). <br /><br />Every day across New York State, countless workers face rampant abuse on the job: nonpayment of overtime for 70+ hour workweeks; theft of tips; illegal deductions from wages; and payment of wages drastically below the legal minimum. In industries that form the backbone of the emerging economy, retail, service, restaurants, construction â€“ noncompliance with the basic protections of New York Labor Law is often the norm, not the exception. Unscrupulous employers drive down standards, benefiting from unfair competition with businesses that do comply with the law. The resulting lost wages, tax revenue, and economic stability affect all New Yorkers. Every dollar stolen from the hands of a worker is a dollarâ€™s unfair advantage over the competition and a dollarâ€™s absence from commerce in our neighborhoods. <br /><br />Standing in front of Bright Spot Cleaning, a business that has been accused of violating the workersâ€™ rights Senator Peralta said â€œWe are facing tough economic times with a high unemployment rate and businesses like the one we are highlighting today are taking advantage of working men and women and violating the law. It is unconscionable to steal money from people who simply want to earn and honest dayâ€™s pay and support their families. Peralta continued â€œThe Wage Theft Prevention Act t will guarantee that hard working New Yorkers will be fairly compensated and that unscrupulous businesses will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.â€ <br /><br />Deborah Axt, Deputy Director, Make the Road New York said â€œWage thieves steal almost a billion <br />dollars every year out of the pockets of New York city&#039;s working families, undercutting decent <br />businesses trying to play by the rules. The Wage Theft Prevention Act will level the playing field by <br />putting a real price tag on this kind of law-breaking for the first time.&quot; <br /><br />Sen. Stavisky&#039;s added â€œWage theft is a terrible problem not just for the individual workers who are <br />cheated but for the state as a whole because the practice steals from our tax base and costs up to $1 <br />billion per year in New York City alone. It also leaves law-abiding employers at a disadvantage <br />because their products and services cost more than those of dishonest businesses. Even if an <br />employer is caught withholding wages or overtime, the penalties are so low they do little to <br />discourage the practice. We must protect employees who speak up, and we must stiffen the <br />penalties for the dishonest business owners so that they are more of a deterrent.â€ <br /><br />The Wage Theft Prevention Act would increase penalties and tighten enforcement of the New York laws protecting workers like those at Bright Spot from nonpayment and underpayment of wages. Advocates also project that the WTPA would bring in approximately $50 million in increased savings and revenues to help the state government save valuable programs currently on the chopping block due to the fiscal crisis. <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_30730"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>SENATOR PERALTAâ€™S BILL PROTECTS CONSUMERS FROM GREEDY CORPORATIONS UNFAIRLY CHARGING FOR BILLING STATEMENTS</strong></span><br />(Queens, NY) The State Senate passed legislation (S7296A) sponsored by Senator JosÃ© Peralta (D-Queens) that will protect consumers from the growing trend of companies attempting to charge an additional fee for receiving paper billing statements instead of electronic billing statements. <br />In an effort to establish billing systems that are solely electronic, many companies throughout the nation have proposed charging consumers for receiving their billing statements on paper in the mail. Moreover, a growing number of banks and credit card companies are already charging these fees, which can sometimes be as much as $2.50 and more. <br />While these fees may seem practical as technology and the internet continue to become a part of everyday life and paper costs rise, not everyone has a computer and internet access. Paper billing and payment fees disproportionately affect low-income consumers and older customers who are less likely to have access to the Internet.&nbsp; There are approximately 2 million households in New York without Internet access, and imposing a fee for a paper bill would unfairly punish these New Yorkers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />While the environmental benefits of electronic billing and payment are clear, a better approach to reducing paper use in this area is available. Several major companies have successfully reduced paper usage by offering customers an incentive to switch to electronic billing and payment.<br />Senator Peralta said, â€œJust when we thought there could not possibly be another hidden fee buried in the&nbsp; myriad of charges already imposed on customers, companies are attempting&nbsp; to scheme more backdoor costs on consumers.â€&nbsp; He continued â€œThere is a difference between charging for services and extortion and this legislation will ensure that companies will no longer be permitted to simply create revenue streams on the backs of their customers.â€&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />This legislation now awaits action from the Assembly. <br /></div>

Her actions are a nod to right-winged hatemongering that we will not tolerate in New York.â€ <br />&nbsp;<br />Roberto Lovato of Presente.org said â€œPresente.org and the more than 100,000 people who&#039;ve signed our national petition demanding Major League Baseball move the All Star Game out of Arizona are inspired by the almost 10,000 New Yorkers speaking out today. We hope that the Yankees, Mets and MLB commissioner Bud Selig hear the community&#039;s pleas and join our fight to end the racial profiling of Arizona&#039;s BS1070.â€<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Daisy Munoz, Colombian immigrant and member of Make the Road New York spoke at the event saying <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;â€œAs an immigrant in New York Arizonaâ€™s new law makes me feel discriminated against. I feel like our rights are being violated. We must all stand up against this injustice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Wilfredo Larancuent, New York City Co-Chair of the Working Families Party added:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;New York is home to millions of baseball fans and millions of immigrants. The Mets and Yankees have a chance to make civil rights history by being the first teams to declare they won&#039;t participate in the All-Star game unless Arizona changes it&#039;s terrible law or the game is moved.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Peralta concluded â€œAs a diehard Mets fan, of course I would like to see every Mets on the 2011 All Star team, I just donâ€™t want them playing in a state that legislates intolerance and hatred.<br />&nbsp;<br />Letâ€™s have the 2011 All Star Game in Queens, the most ethnically diverse and celebrated community in the nation.&quot;</div>

After taking a stand to protect parks earlier this year when the Governor proposed dramatic cuts, Senate Democrats were able to negotiate an agreement to restore full funding for all parks, fulfilling their promise to keep parks, campgrounds, historic sites and botanical gardens open for New Yorkâ€™s families.<br /><br />Parks are a major economic engine for communities across the state; a recent study indicates that the return on investment for parks operations is five-fold, $1.9 billion in total revenue.<br /><br />The agreement also maintains funding for the very popular Department of Environmental Conservation campgrounds, which become the summer home for thousands of students who learn the importance of environmental protection and wilderness skills.<br /><br />â€œI am pleased the Governor has agreed to keep our parks open.&nbsp; Many families in New York are facing tough economic challenges this year and cannot afford to go on vacation.&nbsp; &nbsp;State Parks will be the only respite for many New Yorkers which is why it was so important for us to keep them open.â€&nbsp; said Senator Peralta.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Two months ago, the Senate Democratic Majority approved a budget resolution which included the same funding level for parks operations as last year, preventing 57 State Parks from closing and another 22 State parks from operating at reduced hours and staffing levels.&nbsp; </div>
