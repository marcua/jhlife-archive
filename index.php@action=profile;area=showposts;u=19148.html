					This sublet is a partially furnished room in a two-bedroom apartment for 3-6 months. I&#039;m flexible with the time frame but 6 months is preferred, from roughly October 1 -- March 31. No pets, no smoking, no drugs. Email <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> if interested and I will send you photos.&nbsp; (Photos are too large for this site.)<br /><br />The spacious room is 13&#039; x 22&#039; and has good light during the day with windows overlooking an inner courtyard from the second floor. It is partially furnished with a comfortable futon sofa bed, a dining room table that could sub as a work table (and could be made smaller), and bookshelves. Closet space is available in the hallway. You&#039;re welcome to bring your own dresser or wardrobe. You&#039;d be sharing the kitchen (with dishwasher), bathroom and small communal entryway with just with me, a quiet writer; my bedroom is at the other end of the apartment so it&#039;s quite private.<br /><br />The entire apartment is about 900 sq ft. This is a large, safe, elevator building with laundry room in the basement, in the heart of Jackson Heights, just a couple of blocks from the subway hub at 74th Street. Express trains bring you to midtown in 20 minutes. <br /><br />I&#039;m looking for someone who can stay from three to six months, and I am flexible with move-in and move-out dates. The monthly rent includes utilities of electricity, gas, and internet.<br /><br />I&#039;m a writer and a part-time professor whose work deals with race, ethnicity, feminism, class, and queer identity. I have lived in this apartment for four years by myself, but previously I had several wonderful long-term roommates, enjoying a neighborly friendship respectful of boundaries. I normally teach writing workshops in this room, but I need to take a break and would love for the space to host a visiting writer, artist, or scholar, someone mature, quiet, clean, and friendly. I work a lot from home, but keep to myself much of the time during the day, and I go out a few nights each week.<br /><br />If interested, please email me at <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> and me know a bit about yourself, including your profession, employment, and how you spend your days.<br /><br />Rental requirements:<br />Signed subtenant agreement.<br />Security deposit of one month&#039;s rent and first month&#039;s rent upon move in.<br />Two references to call.<br />Rent due at the beginning of every month, within the first seven days.

					<strong>Heightening Stories</strong> is a series of community-based creative writing workshops, focusing on social issues as well as craft, right here in Jackson Heights. Blended fiction and nonfiction classes are taught by acclaimed author and award-winning writing instructor <strong>Nancy Agabian</strong>.<br /><br />Two workshops are being offered in 2016: The Diversity Writing Project, and Personal Prose, details below and here: <a href="http://nancyagabian.com/teaching/current-workshops/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nancyagabian.com/teaching/current-workshops/</a><br /><br />To register or for more info, email <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><br />The Diversity Writing Project</span></span><br />7 Saturday mornings<br />in Jackson Heights, Queens<br />10:30 am – 1 pm<br />Session 1: January 30 — March 19, 2016 (with a break on February 13)<br />Session 2: April 2 — May 21, 2016 (with a break on May 7)<br /><em>A public reading of students’ new work will take place the week of May 22–26, TBD</em><br />Limited to 8 members<br /><br />This workshop provides a forum to develop and polish work specifically about issues of identity relating to race, culture, and ethnicity using the framework of literary journal and magazine submissions as a timeline. Each week will be dedicated to a step towards publishing your work: setting goals, researching venues, reading in depth, refining your pitch/submission list, and crafting pitches &amp; cover letters. Also, we’ll read and discuss a recent excerpt from a journal or magazine that connects to content issues we are exploring, such as immigration, assimilation, repatriation, internalized oppression &amp; privilege, historical legacies and losses, language &amp; translation, mixed-race &amp; cross-cultural identities, intersections with class &amp; gender, etc.; writing prompts based on a related craft issue will help to develop new work. This will also be a critique workshop, with members bringing in the pieces they want to publish and receiving facilitated feedback from the group along with suggestions on where to publish. The final week will be a submission session party, when members will bring in their laptops and submit their work to their chosen publications online. For new, intermediate and advanced writers of fiction and nonfiction, the workshop will be a space to share resources and to support each other to develop and prepare work for publication. Whether you want to find community with people who write about issues related to racial, ethnic and cultural identity, prepare this work and get it published, and/or simply learn the steps for publication for the future, this workshop is for you.<br /><br /><strong>To apply,</strong> please send an email to <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> that details 1) how your work or writing interests relate to issues of race, ethnicity or cultural identity, 2) why you want to take the workshop, including your goals and your experiences working with others in community. Attach a double-spaced 5 – 10 page sample of writing.&nbsp;The application process is intended to 1) ensure that the members have a range of diverse experiences to help each other and 2) help each member to focus on their goals, assets and interests as they enter the workshop. <strong>Application deadline: January 23</strong><br /><br /><strong>Note: </strong>This workshop is open to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity or national origin. Structured around an anti-racist framework, the workshop will collectively support more writing by people of color to be published. Those of all racial backgrounds, who write about race, ethnicity, or cultural identity, will be supported in writing and publishing work that contributes to undoing racism against people of color.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">Tuition:</span></strong><br /><strong>Session 1:</strong><br />Register by January 23: $300<br />Register after January 23: $325<br /><strong>Session 2:</strong><br />Register by March 26: $300<br />Register after March 26: $325<br /><strong>Package: Session 1 and 2:</strong><br />Register by January 23: $575<br />Register after January 23: $625<br />(Sliding scale, work trades, and payment plans available: please inquire by email before applying to nancyagabian@yahoo.com.)<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Personal Prose</span></span><br />(formerly titled “Creative Nonfiction/Autobiographical Fiction”)<br />8 Wednesday nights, 6:30 – 9:30 pm<br />in Jackson Heights, Queens<br />Limited to 8 members<br /><strong>Session 1:</strong> January 27 — March 16, 2016.<br /><em>A public reading of students’ new work will take place on March 23.</em><br /><strong>Session 2:</strong> April 6 — May 25, 2016.<br /><br />Geared for intermediate to advanced writers working on individual short stories and essays or fiction/nonfiction book-length projects, this ongoing community-oriented group encourages members to write in a way that is both bravely personal and socially conscious.

					I&#039;m subletting my large one-bedroom apartment for July and August. The specific dates are flexible but I&#039;m looking for a sublet of six to eight weeks. <br /><br />The apartment is located just two blocks from the 74th Street Station. It&#039;s 900 sq feet, so it&#039;s a good sized place for two roommates or a couple, or a couple with one child. Clean, quiet, and comfortable -- and cool with AC.<br /><br />The rent is $1850/month or $500/week (if staying less than 8 weeks), including utilities -- gas, electricity and internet.<br /><br />Please send me a message through this website for more details and for photos. Include your email address.

					Dear JH Life readers,<br /><br />I&#039;m happy to announce opportunities to join two ongoing writing workshops starting in late April 2015.&nbsp; Details can be found below and on my website: <a href="http://nancyagabian.com/teaching/current-workshops/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nancyagabian.com/teaching/current-workshops/</a>&nbsp; <br />Email me at <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> with any questions.&nbsp; And feel free to spread the word!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Community Writing Exercise Workshop</span></span><br /><br />Tuesday nights, 7 — 9 pm<br /><br />Starting April 28 and ongoing through June 30, 2015.<br /><br />Commit to at least four consecutive sessions. Enrollment open till June 2.<br /><br />In Jackson Heights, Queens<br /><br />Limited to eight members.<br /><br />$380 for all ten weeks or $160/month.<br /><br />For beginner writers, or writers looking for a means to jump back into their writing process, this workshop will provide time to write while exploring issues of place, community and identity as they manifest in Queens and beyond. The first three to four weeks will be devoted to development: we’ll read and discuss short texts and do interactive writing exercises that may be adapted for poetry or prose. Extra writing prompts will be given for you to try during the week to keep your writing muscles active; during our meetings, time will be allotted for everyone to read aloud exercise results in order to receive supportive responses from the group. In the fourth or fifth week, we’ll work on revisions, supplementing our writing time with critiques of participants’ polished pieces of between three and five pages.&nbsp; Then we’ll repeat the monthly cycle — 3-4 weeks development, one week revision. Craft and content topics will be geared for the needs, assets and interests of the group members. Examples of past lesson/writing topics have included “Dialogue and scene: A memorable conversation”, “Character and life experience: A first or last time”, and “Creating tension: suspense and structure”. If appropriate, the group will collaborate to work on a theme together, based on issues that are affecting our communities, and we’ll organize a reading, publication, or website of our work.<br /><br />To apply: Please email <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> three paragraphs that 1) explain your experience in contributing positively to a community or group and what you could offer to be a successful member of this workshop; 2) describe your interest or experience with writing and how you think this particular workshop could help you, and 3) identify some of the Queens (or NYC) community issues that you care about the most.

Held in a supportive environment in the instructor’s home, the weekly sessions include discussions of exemplary contemporary fiction and nonfiction, craft exercises to help you develop material and learn writing techniques, and constructive group feedback sessions. Content and craft are fused in an innovative set of lessons that are adjusted to the interests and needs of the group; content topics have included writing on race, class, gender, sexuality and their intersections; cross cultural &amp; queer experiences; the immigrant experience; war and occupation; food writing; and health, wellness and the body. Readings may include stories, chapter excerpts or full books as well as attendance to one or two public readings relating to the topics we will be exploring. By the end of the ten weeks, you will have completed or revised up to twenty pages of writing (one long piece or a few short essays, stories or chapters) that will be ready to publish.<br /><br />To apply: Please email <a href="mailto:nancyagabian@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">nancyagabian@yahoo.com</a> two paragraphs that 1) explain your experience in contributing positively to a community or group (writing or otherwise) and what you could offer to be a successful member of this workshop and 2) describe your writing goals, the writing you would like to do with this group and how you think this particular writing workshop could help you.
