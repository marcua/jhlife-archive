				If it&#039;s take-out/delivery pizza only--disappointing. We don&#039;t eat pizza except on rare occasions. If they also offer the broader Italian food menu someone posted, that sounds great, though I really do not understand why it seems impossible for anyone to open a pub or full-service cafe or bistro or any variety of a real American-style restaurant in this neighborhood. We are the most diverse neighborhood, yes, but what is left out is the sort of place I just mentioned. The two places that are in the works seem to be suffering from an extraordinary series of delays, while there are new restaurants opening all the time that are oriented towards one particular segment of the immigrant JH population or another. And why is that? And how many sports bars does one neighborhood need? <br /><br />I know I am being politically incorrect, but it seems to me that this neighborhood is made up of businesses that cater to their population only. It&#039;s like the &quot;integrated&quot; school where the members of different groups never mix. That&#039;s fine, only I don&#039;t understand why there can&#039;t be a few more places that cater to me. Basic American food, chicken, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, good veggies and salads, beer and wine. Not a diner -- with a nicer atmosphere than that, ideally with no TV! (I know that&#039;s asking a lot--there are TVs everywhere now.) <br /><br />I do enjoy all the varied cuisines available here, but why is it asking too much to have something like a Bareburger as well? Some of the restaurants here are quite expensive and always busy. It&#039;s simply not true that people here can&#039;t afford anything more than fast food. Why can&#039;t we have a few traditional American/European-style options? I really don&#039;t get it, but I am beginning to think there is some sort of conspiracy to prevent that from happening.

				&nbsp;Wonderful news. Finally, we will have a good good pizza place to call our own. Disappointing if it is only does take out and&nbsp; delivery, I was under the impression that that particular location should have enough room for sitdown service, as I think the other pizza places that existed there did.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;ll be by sacs on Thursday so I might pop in and ask for clarification.

				LTR - there have been restaurants such as you wish in the JH area like the Cavalier (American) and Limoncello (Italian) that have gone out of business.&nbsp; I&#039;d say we have what our community supports - unfortunately with the large rents opening a business in JH is a big risk.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to Sacs and I hope it is sit down.&nbsp; I hope the other restaurants - the Queensboro will come soon, but I know I shudder when I go by Lockwood and see how empty it is at times.&nbsp; The chains - like Gap, Starbucks, and Sketchers and the restaurants with a built in following are more likely to survive.

				Liz--with lots of new residents coming into JH, the area is changing and has changed since the restaurants you mentioned went by the wayside. People are spending a lot of money to buy apartments here now. How can it be that we cannot support a wider variety of food options? People who are relatively affluent who live here go to LIC or Astoria to patronize restaurants. Or Sunnyside. Does Sunnyside have that much wealthier or more upscale a population than JH? Even Woodside has Case del Chef and I think a few other places. Why can&#039;t JH have the same? I don&#039;t believe what you say. Some of the places here ARE expensive. And seem to be doing well.

				been following since day one. since stew and redge initially proposed a lovely sounding place, then said every other restaurant in the neighborhood served dog food, and anyone who disagreed was not welcome to cross their threshold.<br /><br />not sure what is going on with the queensboro, since dudley has gone radio silent. hoping for the best there.<br /><br />if you find northern too far (it is a bit of a walk for me as well), Cassidy&#039;s is probably off your list, too. 75th and 31st, right across from Canelle/the mini mall. atmosphere is welcoming, though.

				It&#039;s not politically incorrect to say you hope for more diverse food options near 37th Avenue.<br /><br />There&#039;s definitely some decent options along Northern or farther north - Uncle Peter&#039;s, Armondo&#039;s, the pub near JH Plaza - that go beyond Nepalese/Indian/South American fare.<br /><br />I&#039;m equally as frustrated with the limited options. The food we have is good, but it sure would be nice to be able to sit down somewhere with a nice ambiance, beer and wine selections, and get a decent burger. <br /><br />I think the difference between JH and Sunnyside is density. Sunnyside just isn&#039;t as dense a neighborhood, but it does have a sizeable Latino population well served with a number of restaurants. It also has nice Italian, French Bistros, a Gastropub, Wine Bar, Irish Bars, etc. Perhaps the issue in JH is that the population density and demographics makes it appear too big a risk to try anything that doesn&#039;t cater to the large South America and South Asian populations?<br /><br />Whatever the reason is, I think the answer is to be sure to patronize those businesses that do open up that serve what you want, so there is a track record of success catering to other tastes.

				Dssjh--we are probably neighbors, sounds to me like we live close by one another. Yeah, I would not walk to Cannelle either, but I&#039;d drive or take a car service over there. I like Irish pubs well enough, and would likely patronize Cassidy&#039;s a lot if it were near my apartment.&nbsp; Nice to know about it. I used to like Armondo&#039;s when it was in the Bruson Building. It was close to home, homey and old fashioned, and I liked the fish dishes and homemade ravioli. I am sorry to say that in its new digs, I am liking it less. Prices seem higher and the two times we went there, I didn&#039;t like what I ordered. Menu has changed. Room is smaller, noisier and less comfortable, to me. I&#039;m glad it&#039;s there, but the truth is, I am not likely to walk over there for higher prices and food that I don&#039;t like very much. Honestly, I&#039;d be thrilled to have even a Panera in the Bruson Building. Their food is pretty good, a step up from fast food, and the location in Astoria, at least, is roomy and comfortable. We&#039;ve been going a bit to a Filipino place in Woodside around 165th, not far from SriPaPhai, House of Inasal, that is inexpensive but comfortable, in a not fancy but not awful-looking setting (no fluorescent lights and no Coke machine), wine and beer available, food very good. We also like Thakali Kitchen but not always in the mood for that cuisine. Like Kitchen 79 but not always in the mood for Thai either. Just want a more basic option that is a pleasant dining experience, beer and wine, offering burgers, chicken, pasta, salads, etc. Don&#039;t see why we can&#039;t have a place like that in JH in the more central area--37th Ave or even 82nd St. My dream: a Bareburger! I emailed the guy who started that chain, who is from Astoria. He said he does plan on coming to JH, but cannot say when that might happen.

				ljr - I couldn&#039;t agree with you more. While I do love the varied local cuisines, I find I mostly order it in. It&#039;s very frustrating to have to leave my immediate neighborhood to find anything else I might crave, including Bareburger or other basic options with welcoming atmospheres, or neighborhood bars that are young, single-woman-friendly.<br /><br />And another Wendy&#039;s is opening!? I&#039;m so annoyed about that for so many reasons.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even eat out all that often, but when I do I want GREAT food with an aesthetically pleasing, TV-less environment. I was so looking forward to Swim Two Birds and it&#039;s been so disheartening to witness their decline and seemingly lack of progress. I agree with the notion that we need to patronize and support the local business that we want to succeed and stay, but how do we convince them to open up here in the first place?

				Is it just me or is this thread kind of negative for such positive news?<br /><br />I&#039;m going to focus on the positive. We are getting a pizza place that serves one of the best slices of pizza in the entire country. There could be a whole host of reasons - some of which could be out of their control, like lack of an available space - why it&#039;s not a sit-down restaurant, but that&#039;s what the owners decided and we should respect that. I also think people are underestimating how difficult it is to open and operate a successful restaurant in the first place. <br /><br />The neighborhood will eventually gentrify and we will get a Bareburger. But it&#039;s just not at that point yet, for a number of reasons, and it will take place much slower than other NYC neighborhoods. I also tend to see that as a positive though. I&#039;m not in a rush to become the next Astoria or Forest Hills. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again--Rico Tinto is as close as the neighborhood comes to the kind of place several of you are suggesting. Not only great Mexican and Columbian cuisine but also very tasty and healthy veggie and salad options as well as a mighty good burger. And, another neighborhood rarity, creative and attractive presentation and generally good music. I&#039;m still anxiously awaiting the Queensboro and Swim 2 Birds but in the meantime, a local gem which should be encouraged.&nbsp; If only they had later hours and a liquor license.

				Lalochezia--what you are saying is what I was suggesting. Is there a reason that some businesses seem to have smoother sailing in JH than others? Is there some sort of discrimination going on? Or preferential treatment according to who knows who and possibly relating to ethnicity?&nbsp; It kind of looks that way to me. <br /><br />Cultarist--I agree with the positive comments about Rico Tinto. But--and this is a big but--they have limited seating, no wine/beer, and early hours. Their food is very good, but they are a breakfast and lunch place primarily, and that&#039;s not when I most often go out. I once stopped by there to pick up a salad for dinner on my way home, and the wait for the food was insanely long. There were few people around, it was close to closing time, and they couldn&#039;t throw together a salad without making me wait for at least 30 minutes. I gave up on the idea of getting dinner to go from them, since I could not actually sit down and have dinner there after coming home at 8-9 PM, which is pretty frequent for me. It&#039;s frustrating because the food is really good. I am looking for an option that meets my needs for someplace where I simple, decent dinner can be had at a later hour.

				Good luck to Sac&#039;s, but IMO Louie&#039;s is the best in the hood.<br /><br />When we want pub-like food, we goto Brooklyn, Woodside or Astoria.&nbsp; Should a Bareburger move in, we&#039;d still do the same.&nbsp; Expensive, mediocre food served in an atmosphere that is halfway between a tavern and a Denny&#039;s.<br /><br />Lalochezia, I&#039;m not saying I disagree at all, but can you provide some specific examples?&nbsp; Are these practices something you know as a fact going on around here, or is it more of a &quot;seems to&quot; type of thing?<br /><br />Ljr, I&#039;d like to ask the same.&nbsp; Which ethnicity is getting a leg up?&nbsp; The businesses which you desire (which I do as well) cater more so to white folk and would often be run by them.&nbsp; Are you suggesting that businesses run by white folk which cater to white folk are being held back due to illegal, discriminatory practices?<br /><br />Is there a possibility that the very high commercial rents along with the relatively small amount of commercial space in a very densely populated neighborhood could contribute to most businesses primarily catering to the predominant populations who live here?<br /><br />Everytime I see a post on Swim 2 Birds, I&#039;m less likely to go.&nbsp; Just because the owner kvetched like Job on social media doesn&#039;t mean other owners don&#039;t go through the same issues.&nbsp; How long did Barrils take to open?&nbsp; Bachue was empty forever (and it still seems so!).&nbsp; Oceanic Boil took ages to open.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Palermo--where do you go for pub food in Woodside? We tried the place that supposedly had the &quot;best burgers&quot; and found it entirely unremarkable. Burgers the same as any diner.

				Sac&#039;s in Astoria is fabulous. At least it was when I had a boyfriend that lived near them and they were our go to pizza joint when I stayed over. I also think Louie&#039;s is good too. It will be a toss up. Louie&#039;s has seating, so when my spouse and I want to get out of the house, I guess we&#039;ll go there. Sac&#039;s will be closer to us, so when we want take out, I guess we&#039;ll order from there.<br /><br />What I&#039;m also missing in the neighborhood (aside from an Irish or British style pub) is a couple of restaurants that would work for a relatively inexpensive date night. The SO and I have hit Armondo&#039;s and Uncle Peter&#039;s, but they both can get pricey quick. Food that doesn&#039;t break the bank, with wine and beer available, in an atmosphere that allows us to gaze at one another romantically (or, since we&#039;re an old married couple now, doesn&#039;t have a TV distracting us when we&#039;re trying to have a date!)

				I too have lived here for about 5 years and am surprised there isn&#039;t a bistro type place you can sit down for a decent beer, burger or salad. There&#039;s 10 places per block in park slope and now Astoria. Had friends in town and had to work late so we met in Astoria for a later drink with decent atmosphere, kinda sad we couldn&#039;t just do that here in JH. The scorpion? No. Ready penny? Think not. <br /><br />I looked into opening a place on 37th next to GNC (been empty since I moved here) and they want over 7000 month. Seems steep to me as a few friend and I opened a coffee shop in bed stuy and it&#039;s half that for rent for same space. Now a salon is opening next door (yes another one!!) and the sari place expanded to 2 storefronts. As for preferential treatment, do you really think they&#039;re selling at a minimum $14000 worth of saris a month to stay open? Or are they getting a deal? Not trying to be coy, just curious why we have so many salons and pharmacies and 99 cent stores still while it seems restaurants are having a hard time to open (besides fighting with the local community board)<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait for Sac&#039;s, pizza is my favorite meal!

				I do believe what some are bemoaning is the fact that it doesn&#039;t make sense that Jackson Heights, particularly within the historic district, is not attracting the more aesthetically pleasing restaurants that other areas have.&nbsp; An influx of these establishments along 37th Avenue and 82nd Street would transform our neighborhood into one of the most desirable neighborhoods in the boroughs.&nbsp; We have so much potential, but it is not being realized.&nbsp; Cute little places with outdoor seating have sprung up all over the place in other neighborhoods, but do not exist here at all.&nbsp; These types of establishments bring an element of beauty, life and safety (with people being out in the evening) that improves the quality of life and increases property values.&nbsp; Our garden co-ops, tree-lined streets and landscaping make for a neighborhood that is far more aesthetically pleasing than Astoria, Sunnyside and even many neighborhoods in Brooklyn, yet we are sorely lacking this one amenity. It just doesn&#039;t make sense.

				And here&#039;s the big question--and I&#039;m dying to get an answer for anyone who might know.

How (and one might say WHY) do they survive? Please someone, weigh in.

				Hum and Cultarist--exactly, and exactly. Two big, extremely puzzling questions. As to why no cute little cafes and restaurants (except of course for E77, which I love) I keep hearing things like, &quot;We don&#039;t have the kind of population to support those kinds of places here,&quot; which is absurd. Of course we do, and more and more every day. I see all sorts of people in E77--all nationalities, young, old, different languages, etc. It appeals to a huge part of the population in JH. Just Made 4 You seems always busy, as well--too bad they don&#039;t have more of a restaurant atmosphere because I think their food is very decent and a good value. We order from them a lot. I just don&#039;t get it. I know the rents are high, but there are so many businesses here that as Cultarist said, don&#039;t seem to have many customers yet they seem to survive. Or...there is something fishy going on. <br />

				I am not exactly sure about what you all are complaining about. No neighborhood has everything. I will tell you what Sunnyside doesn&#039;t have: good Thai food. How about Astoria? Good Chinese. (To be fair, Jackson Heights doesn&#039;t have decent Chinese food either but a walk to Elmhurst is not too bad.)<br /><br />A more appropriate tone should be this neighborhood doesn&#039;t have places that cater MY needs but it may be fine for most or the current majority. Personally, I am glad that there&#039;s no wine bars on the 37th avenue. Anytime I walk past one in the village, I just wish it&#039;s a Sichuan restaurant instead.

				I know, Puri.&nbsp; You&#039;re right.&nbsp; Not every neighborhood can have everything.&nbsp; Nor should it.&nbsp; (Parenthetically--one thing we DO have that we didn&#039;t have before: a great restaurant with outdoor seating--I dropped by the newly expanded brick-and-mortar Arepa Lady and it&#039;s a delight and, of course, delicious--you all gotta check it out).&nbsp; While I wouldn&#039;t mind a bistro or burger joint, I&#039;m actually MORE concerned that the incomparable Terraza 7 may soon go out of business because of, yes, higher rents.&nbsp; And there is nothing like Terraza 7 here or in any other neighborhood that I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; So, it&#039;s not just a matter of lamenting the elusive wine bars and Irish pubs but just a matter, once again, of WHY are great places shut down or prevented from opening while others survive with no customers.&nbsp;

				I agree with Cultarist that this is an excellent question--why places with no clientele seem to survive, while unique places like Terrazza 7 go out of business or are prevented from opening by endless red tape and hassles from the city, I also don&#039;t get the sniffy tone regarding people stating their preferences as to which sorts of eating establishments they would like to see here. Saying &quot;no neighborhood has everything&quot; is beside the point, when people in THIS neighborhood are clamoring for a bigger, less crowded gym, more restaurant variety, etc, in the midst of a large number of empty storefronts and even the so far totally empty Bruson Building. <br /><br />Why am I not allowed to state what I want to see here, while Puri takes a sort of haughty tone implying that my preferences are somehow suspect and not as--what--maybe politically correct as his or hers? <br /><br />I actually think Saw Shack is &quot;decent&quot; Chinese right here in JH. I really am sort of offended by Puri&#039;s wording: &quot;A more appropriate tone should be that this neighborhood doesn&#039;t have places that cater to MY needs but it may be fine for most or the current majority.&quot; What put you in charge of what is &quot;appropriate&quot; for me to say or what tone I &quot;should&quot; take? And how do you know what the &quot;current majority&quot; wants and needs? Really condescending, Puri. I think it&#039;s actually your tone that is not appropriate. <br /><br />There are many people who would agree with me. I don&#039;t see how my stating my desires interferes with your opinions or desires and deserves a putdown from you. Thanks for the recommendation of The Arepa Lady, Cultarist. I&#039;ve heard of it but never been there. Will check it out. But again these blanket statements like, &quot;No neighborhood can have everything. Nor should it.&quot; are nonsensical to me. Why shouldn&#039;t it? And why shouldn&#039;t individuals ask for services and businesses that they want to see in their neighborhood? Why is everyone always so judgmental?&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen demographic figures reported that JH is comprised of 50+% Latinos, and 60% of residents are foreign born. Probably a combination of high rent and a large demographic makes it tough for entrepreneurs to see risking a business failure by not catering to the biggest majority in the neighborhood. Restaurants have a very high failure rate as it is. From a business perspective I get it, but personally it&#039;s frustrating.

				Which visitors want to have American food??

				It&#039;s funny how a serious set of statements get distorted in website banter to a swivel-eyed loon&nbsp; conspiracy theory.<br /><br />I wrote<br /><em><br />&quot;Stop protectionist rent practices that seem particularly prevalent in this neighborhood - publicly shame those who perform such practices.&quot;<br /></em><br /><br />I agree that the burden of proof is on me for this. However, to suggest that there haven&#039;t been real-estate protectionist practices amongst neighborhoods with blocs of ethnicities in NYC&nbsp; is being willfully ignorant of history. I am extrapolating from that - and people have posted anecdotes about &quot;in prices&quot; and &quot;out prices&quot;. I would like to see real data, but I don&#039;t have access to people that collude. Perhaps journalists might be interested?<br /><br /><br />I wrote <br /><br /><em>&quot;Have CB3/dept of buildings/the city treat all businesses fairly, not just ones that appear to &quot;know people&quot;. If necessary, fire,replace and/or criminally prosecute members of these organizations for corruption. &quot;<br /><br />Make it so that small businesses can open quickly and fairly and not just leave the fastlane for either megachains/franchise with muscles, or people with family/ethnic group &quot;in&#039;s&quot;. <br /></em><br /><br />We&#039;ve seen examples where businesses without &quot;ins&quot; have been treated shoddily, whereas <br />i) chains and ii) restaurants who have local connections can open incredibly quickly.<br />Caffebene took less than 3months. Blink took 4-5 months. A couple of the 82nd street clothing stores only took a few months to go from empty-&gt;chain. <br />Local businesses with ins on the ground: Emoji took 3 months. That banquet hall on the corner of 37th/75th took about 10 weeks! <br /><br />Yet outsiders to these networks have high rents and obstructionism to deal with. <br />&nbsp;<br />I wrote<br /><em><br />&quot;Make the SBJSA law so that existing small businesses have stability and aren&#039;t rent gouged out of existence, turning NYC into a giant mall. <br />http://takebacknyc.nyc/sbjsa/&quot;<br /></em><br />I would hope this is obvious.<br />-<br /><br />If people want to snark, fine. Bur there are real structural problems with this neighborhood re: businesses that cater to its residents.&nbsp; This isn’t the most terrible thing in the world - oh noes ….the whiteys can’t get brunch or a cocktail! -&nbsp; but a neighborhood that contains businesses that are walkable that serve its residents is a thing to strive for.&nbsp; See Jane Jacobs etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;Even through the demographics of JH as a whole can’t support gentrified businesses en masse - which is fine! - of the ~120k people in JH,&nbsp; &nbsp;in the historic district there are already thousands - I would guess <strong>about or exceeding ten thousand</strong> - middle-income people who could support a few of them, and they are underserved.<br /><br />Finally,&nbsp; the idea that this is the &quot;free&quot; market is laughable. There are market pressures, but&nbsp; there are so many roadblocks placed in the way of prospective businesses by city agencies (some of which are entirely justifiable!), combined with entrenched real estate interests and a completely non-level playing field….that calling it &quot;free&quot; is an insult to those who struggle and fail against forces way beyond just price pressue. <br />

				Lalocheese, your argument is well put. The &quot;burden of proof&quot; = &quot;prove it!&quot; Of course you can&#039;t prove it if it&#039;s not something one would flaunt.<br /><br />I only have one anecdote that I can share/have shared on this site. I was witness to a young lawyer in a meeting discussing some similar issue (I think it was in putting together a brief for an SRO), where she said her father, a Korean immigrant who owned a building, gave preference to other Koreans--that that is how it is done. <br /><br />Well, it seems logical given issues of language, trust, support, etc., but still, it is fundamentally unfair. I take umbrage at the insinuation of racism/anti-immigrant. We all know that white-held property owners and businesses have done it and in so doing have influenced the nature of a given neighborhood. <br /><br />It may be business as usual, but it is also not in the spirit of the free market. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t this thread supposed to be about a pizza place?!

				It is likely that the places that open quickly (esp. chains) have more money and more experience at successfully opening a business. They identify a good spot and know how to get all of the approvals, contractors, employees, etc lined up to build out the space and open. No conspiracies necessary. Some owners are just better at business.

				Lalochezia--yes, what you say is what I am thinking and you explain it very well! The ethnic communities in JH are quite insular, and it only makes sense that they would give preference to their own, just as different groups have done in various ways forever. I once mentioned that I was making some sort of charitable donation and my mother-in-law asked me, &quot;Couldn&#039;t you find a Jewish group to give to?&quot; It never occurred to me to think that way, but her generation does. Charity should stay within the &quot;family.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;m sure that thinking extends to businesses as well. So claiming that it&#039;s all &quot;market forces&quot; and nothing but that is naive, IMO.&nbsp; <br /><br />I suspected I would be ripped apart for my previous post on this, and I was. The statement that the notion of &quot;white people discriminating against white people&quot; being a ridiculous idea assumes that the landlords are all white people, doesn&#039;t it? And of course they are not. <br /><br />When you say there is a segment of the JH population that is underserved, you sum up exactly what I am trying to get across. We do love the ethnic cuisines we can find here, but for medical reasons, in fact, we cannot eat spicy, sweet (Thai sauces), or carb-heavy (rice and noodle based cuisines) all the time. <br /><br />We would just love a place to dine out in nice surroundings where we can get a simpler, American or European-style meal, with wine and beer and without the glaring fluorescent lights, many TVs, and ugly Coke machine in the dining room. <br /><br />I agree that Chivito d&#039;Oro is a fine place, but it&#039;s also one of the places that becomes wild when the games are on. We made the mistake of walking up there one evening, then decided to push on to Urubamba because we didn&#039;t fancy dining out surrounded by screaming soccer fans. <br /><br />Anyway, my rant got started because I was wondering how/why some of the newer eating establishments seemed to open quickly and easily, while the ones that would seem to be the answer to my desires have not. Not just taking longer--but halted for years. Is it just bad luck of some sort? <br /><br />Swim Two Birds did get approval for its liquor license, so the community board did not stand in its way or punish the owner for his arrogance or whatever. It&#039;s now halted because of building violations that date back for years. That&#039;s what I heard. But there were two previous restaurants in that space during my tenure in JH--both of them Indian restaurants, one of which we loved. Did they get halted by the ancient violations? I don&#039;t think so. And there is a fast-food chicken place next door, which opened maybe a year or so ago.&nbsp; Why didn&#039;t that get halted by the ancient building violations if they are really as old as I heard? Thanks Lalochezia for summing up so well.

				@Rhino, I am hoping you are wrong. I am very much looking forward to a decent pizza place on this end of the district.<br /><br />Concerning the walls, to each his own, but red apparently is not an appetite inducer. (There are lots of articles discussing this on the net.) And it just so happens that I viscerally react accordingly. Patches of red--maybe--but this is intense.<br /><br />Yet blue is supposed to be the best appetite suppressant, and my favorite restaurant has a powder blue theme throughout: The Oneness-Fountain-Heart Gourmet Vegetarian Restaurant. <br /><br />So there you go.

				I would love to&nbsp; have a succesful pizzeria &quot;uptown&quot; In fact, it&#039;s one of my favorite foods. So much so, I opened one up in the city, a few years back. That being said, I&#039;ve been in the restaurant business continually for the past 40 years. I&#039;ve owned three restaurants in Manhattan and have consulted on many more. I&#039;ve also lived in JH for over 20 years, and have studied and researched on opening a place here more times than I can count. I have seen Sacs in Astoria, it looked really cool from the outside, although I&nbsp; have never been. I really don&#039;t want to speak publicly about these guys business. I do however have a pretty good instinct about what&#039;s a good fit in the right location. In my professional opinion, 37th ave and 86th street is not it. Hey, it&#039;s tough to open a place, and I wish them all the best.

				Sacs in Astoria has a much bigger location and a full menu. It was my go-to pizza place for delivery when I lived in Astoria (I think I ate there a couple of times but can&#039;t remember specifics). This place seems to be focused as more of a pizzeria than a restaurant, though maybe that has changed. The original announcement was that it was going to be take-out and delivery only, but there&#039;s a number of tables in there now, so maybe people will be able order slices, calzones, etc. to eat at a table.<br /><br />I&#039;m hopeful the owner knows what he&#039;s doing after 27 years owning a business. Louie&#039;s is really the only good pizza I&#039;ve found here so far (and their entrees are good too!) but would welcome something decent on 37th Ave in the 80s.

I&#039;m not going to get too hung up on the type of oven. A high temperature gas fired oven can make a great pizza and I&#039;ve had absolutely terrible pizza cooked in coal/wood fired brick ovens. It all depends on the skill of the person making it. It would be great if they stayed open late (meaning past 10).

				Was looking forward to finally a good pizza place nearby.&nbsp; Took out a medium pie a few nights ago and was pretty disappointed.&nbsp; Service was nice--unlike what others posted--but pizza didn&#039;t have that much flavor overall, i liked the sauce, but the crust was too heavy--seemed like a frozen crust vs. fresh and airy, or chewy, or thin and crisp.&nbsp; Will try again.&nbsp; I do remember liking Sac&#039;s in Astoria.&nbsp; I think Louie&#039;s margarita pie has a slight edge.&nbsp; Seems like I can find a good slice in Sunnyside, Woodside, Astoria--but still a challenge here in Jackson Heights.

				Very excited about having Sac&#039;s in the nabe!&nbsp; I&#039;ve taken out slices from there a handful of times so far, and have been consistently delighted.&nbsp; The crust is single-pane thin, and bagel-chewy in all the right ways.&nbsp; I think the real winner is the &quot;Mama pizza,&quot; which has fresh basil, pools of mozzarella, sweet red sauce, and plenty of garlic (i.e. Margherita).&nbsp; Platonically delicious!&nbsp; The atmosphere is not particularly winsome for eating in, but man is this some good &#039;za!&nbsp; Haven&#039;t had the chicken or sausage rolls, but they are awfully tempting.&nbsp; For my money, Due Fratelli is the neighborhood place for comforting grandma slices, Thomas&#039;s for a belt-buster chicken and broccoli slice, and Sac&#039;s for a Proustian thin-crust slice.&nbsp;

				I still love Louie&#039;s best, but Sacs is a close second and open on Sunday, plus a little closer to where I live, and I&#039;m hoping they will expand in the future and serve more of what they have in Astoria.&nbsp; Since Limoncello closed we are in need (or at least I am) of a local Italian restaurant.

				They are giving out their take out menu. Dinners are included for catering (likely made at the Astoria location), but the menu at the JH location is going to consist of pizza, calzones, salads, and heroes.<br /><br />The offerings are limited by the kitchen space. The JH location looks like it is just too small to store what would be necessary to provide the menu at the Astoria location, and has a smaller kitchen space available. (You&#039;ll notice what they are offering in JH can be done with just a pizza oven and some cold storage)

(It would also be a huge PITA anyway).<br /><br />What they did was called a soft launch. They are handling what they can handle right now - walk in customers - and will scale up as the employees get familiar with the routine and are trained. If they are planning on bringing delivery service within the next couple of days, they must be getting their sea legs and feel confident enough to take on more business.

				I have been going to Sacs in JH since it opened. I think their pizza is fantastic! However lately when I go in its empty. Maybe its the wrong time of evening or maybe the word isn&#039;t getting out about them. It would be a shame if they didn&#039;t make it because people didn&#039;t think to try them. As far as the seating there&#039;s about 12 tables. No it&#039;s not fine dining but it s a damn good pizzeria that you can sit in. They do have other things on the menu and it seems like it would grow if they had a following. Please try it. We need a good pizza place in the 80&#039;s and now we have one!

				Tried their pizza again, this time by the slice and agree it was probably the best in JH. It was empty when I picked up on a weekday night.&nbsp; I tried calling for delivery the week before and couldn&#039;t get through.&nbsp; Maybe they are doing a robust delivery business, or need a better system for answering phone orders.&nbsp; Agree, they could use to do more promotion and hopefully business in the restaurant will pick up.<br />

				I live around the corner and I&#039;m there at least twice a week. The pizza is great and the pasta specials that I&#039;ve had have been excellent. Hopefully it&#039;s just a matter of time, but I see no reason that their shop should be completely empty at any point during the day.<br /><br />Someone upthread wished them well but ominously mentioned that there are forces that would prevent the store from succeeding. I&#039;d like to know what that person meant. They have an excellent product that is priced appropriately for the neighborhood, and considering the dismal quality of the other pizza joints in the neighborhood, it is a real bargain. I can&#039;t see any reason why they shouldn&#039;t do well.

				i tend to like the regular one better because it&#039;s a little cheesier. the old fashioned uses the naples-styled presentation of widely spaced dollops of mozz. still good, but i like a little more cheese.

You can always ask for more cheese topping. <br /><br />Wish they would put out a fully loaded veggie pizza, but I know that stuff just doesn&#039;t sell well enough to make the investment. My school made a fantastic vegan last semester, and got rid of it this semester claiming it didn&#039;t sell.

				I love, love, love Sac&#039;s pizza. Also their eggplant parm heroes. Yet I fear one day I will go over there needing a fix and find the door locked. There is never anyone inside, the owner seems really sad and the restaurant is looking shabby after just 1 year of business.<br />Any ideas on how to politely tell them that the food is great but place is unappealing, entrees are too expensive for the hood (although that food is great too) and that&nbsp; since they are off the main shopping area (up by 86th) they have to do more outreach. Somehow they figured out how to succeed in Astoria. Everyone I know who has eaten there loves it and they would be a tremendous loss to the neighborhood.

				I actually really like the pizza, must respectfully disagree, it&#039;s actually as good as all the hype suggested. <br /><br />It&#039;s just a tough sell in the neighborhood, there are a ton of amazing options and bakeries nearby. And that spot is cursed, I&#039;m sure of it! <br /><br />I think they should maybe go a little bit harder on the decor, have it be more of a destination, instead of a takeout/wolf-it-down at a table spot. Doesn&#039;t have to be to fancy, but it seems like even Louie&#039;s is much more elegant. Or even just have more of anything in there, it&#039;s so sparsely decorated it feels like it could be the cafeteria at the school across the street.<br /><br />I also think pretty much everyone that works there is really friendly and welcoming, and I think over the long term that will pay off, hopefully, as they build relationships with people in the neighborhood. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had highs and lows. High was a chicken francese or something eating in. low was a caesar salad and meatball too expensive and charged by the number of balls, respectively.

				if the interior was more inviting, I wonder if they&#039;d be up for offering beer and wine.

				I&#039;d also say, &quot;not be on 86th Street.&quot; 86th is, like, the last block of Jackson Heights as I know it, and the Sac&#039;s market might be more in the 70s. (Yes, I know, JH extends to 90th or in some arguments Junction, but it gets seriously more downscale in the high 80s.)

				I go there frequently for the wonderful homemade ravioli and agree with most of what&#039;s above. The interior is not welcoming, and the prices are high for this area. The location is not prime. But every time I am in there, people come and go, getting a slice or more. They just don&#039;t necessarily sit down. <br /><br />So I wonder if business is as bad as some think. They might do enough takeout and delivery to make it. Many owners seems sad. It&#039;s a very hard business, totally exhausting. Just an idea...

				Their pizza is probably the best options in our neighborhood, but the worst location. I got two very bad experience with delivery, one time pizza is cold and wet, they did redeliver another one but that is like 2 hr later, another time the guy took over an hr and has no change on him. After that, we just end up doing pickup, but walking 10+ blocks kind of discouraging us to order there more frequent.

				I worry constantly that Sac&#039;s will close. With the exception of Louie&#039;s, which is too far of a walk for me just to pick up a couple of slices, it really is far and above the other pizza places around here. With the bar set so low in this neighborhood I find it hard to believe that they aren&#039;t packed. <br /><br />As far as the decor is concerned, it might be a bit bland but they do keep the place clean, which is more than I can say for most of the restaurants around here (not all). Thomas Pizza is disgusting all around, and so is Pizza Boy as far as I&#039;m concerned. Both look like they haven&#039;t been cleaned since the late 70&#039;s.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think that their prices are too far out of line for the neighborhood.

				I love Sac&#039;s. I want it to succeed. So I write this with trepidation:&nbsp; Can it be that Sac&#039;s thin crust just doesn&#039;t hold up well to the traditional sitting-on-display-and-then-reheating for consumption later? <br /><br />Awhile ago I commented on the harshness of red walls. I got used to them. I kind of like the family portraits on the walls. It is clean. The owner should put a smiling, welcoming face in the front. While the owner is extremely accommodating, that may not be enough for some people. Wear server&#039;s gloves, whether you believe in it or not. I wish they would turn the TVs&nbsp; off and pipe in a little &quot;o sole mio.&quot; (Really, full blown opera on those TVs would suit me just fine!) Wine would help greatly. I recommend the owner give a JHLifer discount by just mentioning a JHL post du jour. (I wanted their home-grown summer tomato salad but it was like 12 or 14 dollars.) We can help by posting our recommendations. Thank you to whoever praised the eggplant parmesan.

				&nbsp;I had this same thought about a week ago. It was a Saturday night and I’m walking there to pick up a couple entries in a pie. Every restaurant I passed was packed. Even oceanic boil was probably 70% plus occupied. I get to Sacs and there’s literally no one there. Well, unless you count the owner who sitting down with a sandwich. I go and pick up my delivery, also noticing that it’s the only pie up there above the stove. I’m starting to get that thought it won’t make it.&nbsp; Which would be a shame. Wouldn’t be the first above average pizza place that happens to as well. Anyone remember Paglicio on Northern?<br /><br />There is a price point issue here as well. For example, we love the Caesar salad from Louies, they make their own dressing. The Caesar salad at Sacs is nowhere near as good and runs about $10. Way too expensive.&nbsp; I’m also a huge chicken Parm fan and the one time I ordered it was not thrilled.&nbsp; Truth be told I haven’t really been thrilled with it from Louise either as of late. The chicken has felt tough and/or A lesser quality.&nbsp; Back to sacs,I did recently have their chicken cutlet with lemon and mushrooms and found the cutlets&nbsp; great so maybe they’ve worked out some kinks? Egg plant Parm very solid.&nbsp; The one time I had her meatballs they were OK.&nbsp; Again, maybe an off night because if I remember the meatballs at Saks Astoria are amazing?&nbsp; Would seriously love to know if anyone knows a great place to get meatballs in the neighborhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;One of my vegetarian friends pointed out that there mushrooms seem to be the canned variety. I think considering their price point they felt they should use fresh mushrooms and I think that’s why this particular family doesn’t order from there much. On the lemon chicken it did look like the canned variety. Strange, since some of their specialty salads they advertise is coming from their own garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;I think the lack of a bathroom is also a problem. Pizza night is great for families, but I’m not taking my family there if there’s no bathroom. <br /><br />Here’s to hoping they pull through!

				I have often wondered how Tomo&#039;s which is next door to Sac&#039;s has survived all these years.&nbsp; I was a regular for years until Okawa opened 3 years ago just 1/2 block from my apartment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe that Sac&#039;s is not doing an incredible business considering its reputation and quality food and yet Thomas Pizza just 3 blocks away on 83rd Street is still in business.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing that Sac&#039;s location on 86 Street is far less expensive than similar space on 76 Street and they felt they had the reputation to attract customers regardless of where they settled.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sac is now open 16 months and I&#039;m not certain what they can do to make it.&nbsp; Imagine, no customers on a Saturday evening.&nbsp; Not having a bathroom is a big minus especially for young families that ptbass75 mentioned.&nbsp; Louie sure knew what he was doing when he opened directly across the Street from Elmhurst Hospital.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah maybe the best thing we can do for Sac&#039;s is stop speculating about their demise.&nbsp; My sense is neighborhood (non-fancy/destination) pizza and sushi places do most of their trade in delivery these days. Slightly forlorn restaurant spaces may not be a cause for concern.<br /><br />Oceanic Boil is different because I think people prefer to eat a messy food like a seafood boil in the restaurant rather than bring it into the home.&nbsp; And it helps that their crab and sauces are delicious and their service is really sweet and friendly. That place is a lot of fun.

And that bakery next to Tomo always has people in it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why everyone assumes being closer to the heart of the historic district is necessary for a restaurant to succeed. For all we know Sac&#039;s is pulling in tons of business from delivery. Have you guys failed to notice all the apartment buildings that surround the buildings these places are located? I like to know my food is being prepared nearby, so I&#039;m going to give greater weight to the closer restaurant most of the time, especially if a long delivery time is going to affect the food (like pizza). We prefer Louie&#039;s, but I&#039;ll consider Sac&#039;s once in awhile (mostly on Sundays).

				I called tonight to see if they are making their wonderful homemade pasta again, after a summer hiatus.

They&#039;ll concentrate on the store in Astoria. <br /><br />I love their pasta. even if it&#039;s pricey. It&#039;s homemade after all. I like the pizza too.

				I stopped by this evening to get a couple of slices and they had a sign outside stating that tomorrow would be their last day. This is a shame because I really liked their pizza, but it isn&#039;t entirely surprising to me. The cracked out stoner kid was constantly bad mouthing the neighborhood and the employees to anyone (mostly white people) who would listen and that pissed off some people. A friend of mine stopped going there because the kid would let loose a string of F-Bombs in front of his six year old daughter. Plus he started letting his dealer friends hang out there and that frighted some people away (see the thread that mentions the red scooter guy). The kid is an idiot and the owner (Dom?) never should have left him in charge. Still, I continued to go there several times a week because they made great pizza. Now I&#039;ll need to travel out of the neighborhood again for good pizza.<br /><br />I suppose the two upsides are that I will lose some weight and perhaps the the dealers on 37th will find someplace else to go. I do, however, wish that the owner as able to stay at this location to keep things running straight. He is a nice guy, and I wish him the best, but he should get rid of that kid who was probably bad for the business in general.

				since a couple posters mentioned DiFara’s, I thought I would mention that I went there a couple weeks back, right at noon when it opened, and there was no Dom. Rumor was he hadn’t been there for six months at that point. The pizza was bad. Square slice was burnt and hard as a brick. Plain slice was not much better. It was maybe his son running the kitchen? I might give the Williamsburg outpost a try, but the Midwood location is not for me anymore.
