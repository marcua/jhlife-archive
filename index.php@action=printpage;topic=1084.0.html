				Coming home today, we drove by what seems to be a new Thai &amp; Sushi place (it may have been here a while, I&#039;m not sure, but their take-out menus were printed in May of this year) at the corner of Woodside Avenue and 77th Street. It&#039;s called Spicy Shallot.<br /><br />It looked very nice and modern inside. The take-out menu is also creative and nicely designed. They seemed to be very busy at lunch today when we drove by so that seems promising. There are Monday through Friday lunch specials for $6.50. They are open from 11am until 2am. They have delivery until 10:30pm. The downside is that they only deliver from Queens Blvd to 35th Avenue; fortunately we live within that boundary. We haven&#039;t eaten here yet, but if anyone does, please let us know how it is!<br /><br />They also have a website: www.spicyshallot.com (but it does not appear to have launched yet).<br /><br />I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed that this place will be really good!

				Shallot has been there for awhile and I think it is quite good. They recently expanded both in size and menu.

				Have been to Shallot 4 or 5 times.&nbsp; Sushi is certainly not the best I&#039;ve ever had - but I like it enough when I am too lazy to travel elsewhere.&nbsp; Pad Thai and other thai dishes are acceptable as well.&nbsp; Give it a shot!&nbsp; If memory serves me correct, they have a bar menu @ $5 per drink - not bad... :D
