When did this happen? I wonder what they could possibly be thinking, given that the Sky Mall just opened one stop away on the 7 line, and the Atlas Park Mall is still on the brink of bankruptcy. Not to mention the enormous, sprawling Queens Center Mall less than two miles away. There are a lot of people in Queens, sure, but we don&#039;t spend every waking moment of our lives at the mall... right?<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I had to guess, they&#039;re thinking that other sports franchises have done this successfully, so why shouldn&#039;t they? Most notably, the New England Patriots have a mall in their parking lot. The difference? The Patriots sell out every game, play in extreme hot and extreme cold weather when folks are looking to step indoors for a little while, have a tailgating culture with lots of fans showing up hours early and staying well after the game is over, and are located in an area that is under-served by shopping centers. The Mets have none of those things going for them. Really bad idea to build a mall there. But that&#039;s the Wilpons for you.

					I think that because these vendors are operating on the Playstreet, which is technically an extension of the park, they actually could just get a &quot;restricted area&quot; mobile food permit, which I understand does not have a waitlist, but which also doesn&#039;t allow them to operate outside of the park. I believe this is managed through the Parks Department, although the vendors would still have to complete the Food Protection Course and verify that their equipment is in compliance with the applicable rules of the Department of Health. <br /><br />This situation is not dissimilar to that of the Red Hook &quot;Soccer Tacos&quot; vendors, albeit the scale is much smaller here in JH, with only a handful of these types of vendors at most (speaking strictly about those set up at the Sunday market). I believe the solution in Red Hook was the issuance of this type of &quot;restricted area&quot; permit, although the vendors had to upgrade their equipment, and those that could not afford to do so were weeded out, I suppose. Still, it offers a little bit of hope that our local food vendors can actually sustain their businesses legally if they go through the proper channels.<br /><br />Personally, I do think the vendors add a unique quality to the Sunday market, and one that is worth protecting. I had been eyeing their food for weeks - I usually go first thing in the morning, so I hadn&#039;t tried the food yet because tostadas and elote aren&#039;t exactly breakfast in my mind - and thinking that it was really cool that there was food on offer at the market that reflected the cultural diversity of the neighborhood. Yesterday my husband and I went early in the afternoon, and enjoyed some flautas and chicken mole tamales while watching the soccer game (on asphalt!) in the Garden School yard. The vendors were very pleasant, the food was tasty, and I think the environment at the market is better for it. I hope that they do ultimately go through the permit process, and that they&#039;re able to continue to sell there for a long time.

					Brook Lyn, <br />If you liked CrossFit, but Astoria didn&#039;t work for you, give CrossFit LIC a look. My husband and I joined about a month ago. It is a short walk from the E/M station at 23rd/Court Sq., and they have a good selection of early morning and evening/night classes. They moved into the space a few months ago, so there are still some things that need work, but the coaches are top notch and it&#039;s a great environment to get a good work-out. Their website is <a href="http://www.crossfitlic.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.crossfitlic.com</a>. Free intro classes are on Saturdays at 11 or 11:30.<br />

					I agree that the program&#039;s expansion relies heavily upon its success in places already selected. But if/when it is deemed successful, new site selection would then be determined by feasibility and user interest. Feasibility will be established based on whether we are close enough to other sites, and it seems that we are. Interest will be established by residents writing in their requests. So, if interested, you can write in now and hopefully help put JH on the short list of phase two sites.

					While the 45 minute limit does put some neighborhoods in Manhattan out of reach for some coming from Jackson Heights, I think that for reasonably fit riders there are many areas reachable within that timeframe, including Midtown East and West, Kips Bay, Murray Hill, Gramercy, Union Square, and even parts of the East Village; Greenpoint and Williamsburg would be reachable as well, as would the other areas in Queens currently slated to receive bikes. If there are enough commuters from Jackson Heights going to these areas that want to give biking a try, then I think it&#039;s a viable option, but it&#039;s obviously up to those commuters to write in their requests.<br /><br />I think you raise a good point, Steven, about public safety and traffic, and I&#039;d hope that people use common sense, obey laws, and ride within their abilities.<br />

					Hi Neighbors,<br /><br />As I&#039;m sure many of you know, the DOT is launching a new bike share program beginning in July, which will place bike rental stations in locations all over Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The idea is to encourage bicycling for short trips, especially to work, to relieve congestion on mass transit. For anyone who has ever considered biking to work, but hasn&#039;t wanted to make the commitment of investing in a bike for fear they won&#039;t like it, this is a great opportunity to try out cycling before making that big purchase.<br /><br />Sadly, Jackson Heights is not on the map of proposed bike station locations. However, the DOT has a page where people can submit requests for additional locations, and I think Jackson Heights residents could greatly benefit from getting a bike station or two. Here is a link to the form:<br /><br /><a href="http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/contact/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/bikeshare/contact/</a><br /><br />Please pass this along to anyone you know in the neighborhood who might be interested in affordable cycling, and have them submit requests as well.<br /><br />To learn more about the bikes, rates, and to see the current station map, go here: <a href="http://citibikenyc.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://citibikenyc.com/</a><br /><br />Thanks!<br />Erica

					Hi,<br />I&#039;m pretty new to the neighborhood and was happy to find this info about a local CSA. I was wondering if there are any required volunteer shifts involved, as I know that&#039;s how many CSAs sort out the shares when they arrive. Also, how many total shares have there been in past seasons, and what is the target number of shares this season?<br />Looking forward to joining!<br />
