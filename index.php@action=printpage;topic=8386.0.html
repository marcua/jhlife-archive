				Hi <br /><br />My business partner Armen Kojoyian and I are licensed agents specializing in sales of apartments in Jackson Heights. You may have seen our website: www.jacksonheightslistings.com <br /><br />Selling real estate in this market for the <span class="bbc_u">right price</span> and <span class="bbc_u">terms</span> is certainly difficult and the only way to achieve it is through high volume of traffic to a property and by coming into a multiple offer position. This is why we put the marketing force of two agencies - Manhattan and a Queens,&nbsp; to get the type of market area coverage needed to be effective. <br /><br />NOTE: No property should be available on the market for too long, it gives the wrong impression. It stigmatizes the property and solicits low ball offers. Any seasoned agent after marketing a property for one month should have the guts to tell you if you are on the right track to sell or NOT.<br /><br />If you choose to go the sale route let us know, and we can schedule a brief visit to your place so that we can determine if it&#039;s the right fit for our buyer base and we can share some of our recent sales experience with you.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen M<br /><br />

If it is run-of-the-mill, then you will probably need a broker to help you get the foot traffic and unload it.<br /><br />Can you rent it? If you can, do that and move on with your life in a more desirable area (to you) and hang on to the place till it is paid off so you keep having passive income.

				It does have a slight view of the church yard behind my building from the 5th floor, though my windows are fogged up and I think it would require the whole building to replace the windows as opposed to being able to replace individually! It at the very least puts my place at an advantage over the other units for sale in my unit, which also has some on the 82nd street side. <br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about renting too, but going through the co-op board sounds like a hassle and I could only do it for 5 years anyway.&nbsp;

				Yes, it is looking beautiful with all the rain feeding the plants this year.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I just signed a contract for a new Manhattan apt, so hard or not, got to sell now! I&#039;ll want to get it on the market while all the beautiful leaves are still green. <br /><br />

				Get more than one broker to give you advice. MPC Properties (I am an agent there) sells the most co-ops in Jackson Heights and has been doing it for 30 years. I&#039;d be happy to bring my broker by for his expert opinion. And good luck with your move! Sounds like you are doing well. <br /><br />Ellen Pratt<br />Agent, MPC Properties<br />718-440-9458<br />ellen@mpcproperties.com
