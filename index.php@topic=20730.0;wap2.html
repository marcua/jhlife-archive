			<strong>BelvedereEast85thStreet</strong>:
			<br />
			Hi all,<br /><br />After 12 wonderful years, my wife and I&#039;ve decided to sell our beloved 2 bedroom apartment at the Belvedere East on 85th Street in the Historic District. It&#039;s a sun-filled, 5th-floor corner unit in great condition with three exposures (mostly eastern, but also southern and western) with a large dining foyer and eat-in kitchen. Spectacular garden, terrific neighbors, pet friendly, and surrounded by great restaurants and amenities. Oh, and wired for FiOS too! Listed at $595,000.<br /><br />The full listing with pictures, floor plan, and broker contact can be found here:<br /><br />https://streeteasy.com/building/35_16-85-street-jackson_heights/5g<br /><br />Showings seem to be scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays with some availability here and there during the week. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me here or contact the broker directly.<br /><br />Best,<br />Adam<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
