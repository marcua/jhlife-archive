				This was released today 2/6/17<br /><br />https://www.nycedc.com/project/sunnyside-yards<br /><br />On February 6, 2017, NYCEDC released the Sunnyside Yard Feasibility Study, a comprehensive study evaluating the technical feasibility of decking over active rail and related facilities in Sunnyside Yard, which sits on approximately 180 acres of western Queens. The release of the study concluded a year-and-a-half-long process led by the City and a team of consultants with significant input from Amtrak and a wide range of community stakeholders, elected officials, and City agencies.<br /><br />

				Oh sure, with more than 6,000 units built in LIC in the last five years and another 16,000 in the works for the next five years (see link below,) why not open up another 180 acres for development. There&#039;s plenty of empty space on the 7 train train: on train roofs and they can squeeze passengers into the top 14 inches inside each car. <br /><br />With apologizes to the great movie Chinatown: Forget it Jake, it&#039;s only Queens.

You&#039;re not going to stop people moving to NYC. Instead, prices just keep going up and up because of high demand and low supply, especially because so much of Manhattan is now purely for rich foreign investors. We desperately need more apartments in Queens if we&#039;re going to continue to have young people in Queens and not turn into San Francisco or somewhere else that prices are simply untenable. This is actually free space - not a park, not a historic district, real free space to put people in that doesn&#039;t destroy anyone else&#039;s home or amenities. This is a brilliant idea for a place to add the apartments we need.

				Presumably the development would include parks and other community facilities, which would certainly be better than what&#039;s there now.

				I&#039;m all for infilling underused space, I just hope it&#039;s not just a bunch of towers of luxury condos and parking garages like are currently going up all over LIC.

				I&#039;m not against development, just that with overcrowding on trains already hapepning, transit and other infrastrucuture improvements are needed before we get a massive, high-rise development on the railyards.<br />It has to be high-rise because there is no way to re-coup the tremendous expense of decking over the railyards, building streets, schools, presumably parks and housing without lots of development there - similar to what&#039;s happening in LIC.

				And just remember, this will be on top of the 5,000 plus units built in LIC in last five years and the !5,000 plus already set to go up in the next five years.&nbsp;

				I do worry about subway crowding if this happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />But you are damned if you do and damned if you don&#039;t - the city is clamoring for affordable housing and that can&#039;t be done if there aren&#039;t high-rises. The urban planners at NYCEDC and Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen are extremely gung-ho advocates for high-rise housing. And I understand why they feel this way even though I personally hate the idea. <br /><br />Just like the plastic bag issue - you can&#039;t have true change without making some uncomfortable choices (ie charging poor people for bags).

				but most &#039;affordable housing&#039; lotteries now have more units set aside for people making $90K per year than people making $40K. granted, times and economies have changed, but if you want young people and creative people to move in - and have something less homogenized, you may want to open the area up to something other than the top 25% of the food chain.
