					Just wanted to check-in to see if you found a place for your puppy. I work at Camp Bow Wow in Long Island City and I love this place. I truly believe that we are the best dog daycare provider in the area. <a href="http://www.campbowwow.com/us/ny/longislandcity-nyc/Home/tabid/3860/Default.aspx" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.campbowwow.com/us/ny/longislandcity-nyc/Home/tabid/3860/Default.aspx</a><br />First thing you will want to do is take a look at the website, then take a look at our webcams to see some live footage our our &quot;campers&quot; having fun out in the play yards. You can then see what it takes to bring your dog in for a FREE interview day. Your dog will most likely love it here and can come for daycare, boarding, grooming or anything else. <br />Let me know if you have any other questions, such as a referral to a vet in the area, or otherwise. <br />Looking forward to hearing from you.<br />-cody

					Joel Silverman, host of Animal Planetâ€™s â€œGOOD DOG Uâ€ and his faithful co-star Foster will be in Long Island City on Monday, September 14, 2009 to make a personal appearance at Camp Bow Wow Long Island City. The duo is currently on a 90-city tour to promote Silvermanâ€™s new book, What Color is Your Dog? While at Camp Bow Wow LIC, Silverman will conduct a 1-hour seminar focusing on the philosophy behind his successful career as an animal trainer, answer questions and sign copies of his book. Foster, an animal actor, himself, will also assist him in a demonstration. Due to space, we ask that you please leave your furry friends at home for this special event.<br /><br />Admission to the seminar and book signing, which begin at 6:30 pm, is free and the public is invited to attend.&nbsp; There will be special front row reserved seating for a donation of $20 as well as other fun things, all benefiting New York City&#039;s Animal Care &amp; Control.&nbsp; Come out to Camp and see a legend in the animal world and help out our furry friends!!&nbsp; Please call Camp Bow Wow LIC to make a reservation for this event, 718-392-9663.&nbsp; <br /><br />Silverman, who is best known as the host of Animal Planetâ€™s long-running program, â€œGOOD DOG U,â€ has trained and performed with different species of animals for over 35 years. Heâ€™s worked with everything from marine mammals like killer whales, dolphins and sea lions at Sea World to domestic house pets like cats, dogs and birds at Universal Studios. In February, Silverman was presented with the 2008 Dog Trainer of the Year Award at the Purina Pro Plan Our Hero Dog Water 54th Annual Show Dogs of the Year Dinner in New York City.<br /><br />Is your dog off the wall? Heâ€™s a red. Totally mellow, then yellow. A very, nervous Nelly then blue. Silverman uses colors to differentiate personality types and explores ways each responds to different stimuli. If you use methods tailored to your dogâ€™s personality and behavior patterns, youâ€™ll be more effective. Silverman is also the founder of Companions for LifeTM, a brand dedicated to ending the needless destruction of hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats each year because their owners didnâ€™t invest the time to build their trust before trying to train them. <br /><br />For more information about Joel Silverman and Fosterâ€™s personal appearance, seminar and book signing at Camp Bow Wow Long Island City on Monday, September 14th, please call 718-392-9663 or visit <a href="http://www.campbowwow.com/longislandcity" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.campbowwow.com/longislandcity</a>.<br /><br />Camp Bow Wow - North Americaâ€™s Premier Doggy Day and Overnight CampÂ® <br />Where a dog can be a dogÂ®!<br />Every Camp Bow Wow facility is as unique as its owner. All are state-of-the-art facilities created to provide a welcoming environment with amenities designed to ensure that the dogs in their care are provided with the exercise and nurturing they require to enjoy their stay. Campers are supervised by a staff of Certified Camp CounselorsÂ® at all times, and curious puppy parents can check in on the play yard activities by logging on to their Campâ€™s web site to watch real-time footage broadcast live by the many Camper CamsÂ® installed around the camp.<br /><br />Heidi Ganahl opened the first Camp Bow Wow in 2000 and began franchising the concept in 2003. In just nine years, Camp Bow Wow has earned the reputation as the premier doggy day and overnight camp in North America. Camp Bow Wow has sold more than 200 franchises in 38 states, and 1 franchise in Canada. Itâ€™s no wonder that Entrepreneur magazine named Camp Bow Wow one of the top 105-fastest growing franchises in North America, and as one of the top 50-fasted growing women-owned/-led franchises in 2008. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.campbowwow.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.campbowwow.com</a><br />
