				At the risk of raining on somebody&#039;s parade, I want to register a note of dissent on all our never-ending neighborhood flea markets. The Methodist church at the corner of 81st and 35th Ave. has a vast flea market every single weekend that takes over the entire block, wraps around the corners, blocks traffic with double-parked cars, and leaves trash all over the place in the aftermath. These institutions are not zoned for retail; they are houses of worship. Nobody objects to an occasional flea market, although I&#039;m not sure who benefits beyond the vendors. But churches and schools in residential neighborhoods should not be turned into open air bazaars on a continual basis, at least not without a change in zoning (which I can&#039;t imagine will be forthcoming). These aren&#039;t retail establishments, nor should they be. The one at the Methodist church in particular has become a reliable weekend blight. Enough already.

				^As clearly stated by the OP, the OP&#039;s issue is &quot;<strong>blocks traffic </strong>with double-parked cars, and leaves <strong>trash all over the place</strong> in the aftermath.&quot; The issues that you dismiss as &quot;other than.&quot;<br /><br />My suggestion to the OP and those who agree is to complain to the Community Board. I don&#039;t know which groups approves flea markets on sidewalks, but that&#039;s a good place to start.

				Not dismissing anything, just pointing out those are separable issues, and asking if there is anything else. <br /><br />Double parking and littering are already illegal. If the streets really are being blocked (which I never noticed, but then again I don&#039;t drive), then the police should be handing out tickets. As for the littering, it seems to me the obvious solution is letting the &quot;host&quot; (the church, I guess?) know they are responsible for sweeping up afterwards.<br /><br />All I&#039;m saying is you don&#039;t have to jump right to banning a community institution that people seem to enjoy.

A seasonal fair could be considered an institution. But a flea market that features the same vendors and wares week after week is most definitely not an institution.<br /><br />To OP - is it really every week? I&#039;ve noticed it a lot, but I&#039;m not at that intersection every weekend.

				I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s every week.&nbsp; Same items for sale, same vendors.&nbsp; It does block the sidewalk and it does get annoying.&nbsp; At this point, I just steer clear and don&#039;t walk on that side of the street.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it serves a purpose and some people do find things there that they need.&nbsp; Perhaps the vendors do make enough money to make storing the items and bringing them to all the sales worth it.&nbsp; But I have to agree, there sure are a ton of flea markets in this area and they all feel largely the same.&nbsp; Being that it&#039;s a church in this case, I&#039;m not sure it will disappear.&nbsp; People don&#039;t have yards here and the flea markets are pretty much community yard sales.

It&#039;s possible those trucks do get regularly ticketed, as a routine cost of business. I know that&#039;s how UPS and FedEx handle it - it&#039;s just as illegal for them to double park as anyone else, and they pay a fortune in tickets, but it&#039;s the only way they can do business.

				I think there&#039;s a couple problems with the argument that since X &amp; Y are already illegal, therefore the solution is to have the police enforce X &amp; Y rather than limit the nuisance is two fold. First, police resources are limited. Secondly, apply that logic to another nuisance. For example, public urination and disturbing the peace are already illegal. If there were no limits on the number of establishments that can hold a liquor license in a given area, would anyone argue with someone calling for a limit to the number of liquor licenses because they were being woken up nightly by drunks yelling and carrying on at 3 am and they were disgusted by the front of their building smelling like urine that the solution isn&#039;t to limit liquor licenses granted, but have the police enforce the law?

				&nbsp;Yes to comment further on the double parking and other violations around 74th street...<br />I have heard businesses around the 73rd/74th street area <em>brag</em> about their protection from tickets. One said<br />&quot;look at the sidewalks, they&#039;re black with grease&quot; and went on to say there was a relationship with a superior in <br />Dept of Sanitation. The double parking is horrendous and is also virtually ignored by the business community on <br />those streets.

				&nbsp;Not a big fan of the never ending weekends of flea markets on 82nd street. I wonder if they have the correct permitting for it? I mean, if they&#039;re obstructing a public sidewalk,&nbsp; most likely they need to have some kind of permit, like a block party permit.&nbsp; My guess is they don&#039;t. <br /><br />So, what is my problem with it exactly? I often travel in that direction with a stroller with my children.&nbsp; If I remain on the sidewalk I&#039;ve hit my head against the low hanging canopies (yes, I try to remember to duck), and constantly have to say &quot;excuse me&quot; to get people to move out of the way from the congestion.&nbsp; Numerous times I find I have to take a stroller with my children into the street because the sidewalk is so clogged with the traffic and/or can&#039;t&nbsp; fit past the vendors.. Major safety issues!

				I was curious to know if, besides the Church itself, if there is anyone or anything that organizes and makes money from this?&nbsp; I totally get when a coop has a once a year flea market, but this is a continuous weekly event on a public sidewalk.&nbsp; For me it just detracts from walking down peaceful, residential, tree lined streets. It increases the congestion and noise.&nbsp; It&#039;s also close to the bus stop which creates even greater density.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t they do this in the confines of their own building?

				I have to agree that these flea markets are getting out of control. They have become a nuisance because it&#039;s literally every single week. <br /><br />They also don&#039;t make sense. It&#039;s not 1990 anymore. Sitting around outside for hours peddling mostly garbage is inefficient. I&#039;ve probably sold a hundred items on eBay with the same amount of time these people spend with one day at a flea market.

				The city is actually scaling back on street fairs for these exact reasons. The same people selling the same crap, with the organizers making a good cut at the expense of the residents who actually live here. I think it being a religious organization may make the permit process easier for this particular block? But I agree, I think their is a loophole that needs to be changed.

				&nbsp;If the Flea Markets mentioned here in Forest Hills article were 2x a year and full of local merchants, I think they<br />would be very popular! But these flea markets complained about in this thread are the same vendors with mostly little items of low value. Hardly any original items, and much different than the once/twice year co-op flea markets<br />which tend to have some treasures.<br /><br />Yes, it&#039;s time to re-write these laws in favor of the communities strongest needs.

				Really interesting issue. I was originally in favor of keeping the 50% local preposition, but then an article had a person who was talking about all the families whose business was solely working the markets. I do agree that they are mostly terrible. Even the one on Junction Blvd is mostly crap. The church ones here are all local, so is that okay? <br /><br /><br />For the people here at the churches, it&#039;s not about making income, it&#039;s more about something to do, or making some pocket change. Maybe they should do it on their lawns or in the parking lots or playgrounds instead. It&#039;s unfortunate but I do think the church is taking advantage.

				Sorry, I&#039;ve been away. Thanks to all those who&#039;ve added to a nicely civil discussion. Yes, it&#039;s every week (or virtually every week). To address the &quot;what&#039;s the problem?&quot; point of view, first, as I said, there&#039;s the blocking of traffic, the blocking of sidewalks, the trash left behind, and the wrecked aesthetics of that particular part of the neighborhood. <br /><br />But there&#039;s a larger issue, which is, why do we even have zoning? To those who don&#039;t think we should uphold the zoning in cases like this, the logical consequence is that we&#039;d have people selling stuff on blankets everywhere and anywhere (something close to reality in midtown, it sometimes seems). I really don&#039;t think this would improve the quality of life in our city, and I wonder why legitimate businesses would persist in paying high rents (covering crucial property taxes), salaries, payroll taxes and so forth if anyone can set up anywhere and sell anything. How about if we look the other way while the Methodist church erects a skyscraper on its property? Where does it end? I agree with whoever made the comment that a flea market a couple times a year would be fine. But it would also be enough. <br />
