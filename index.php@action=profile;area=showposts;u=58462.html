					From Sen. Jose Peralta: Park enforcement officers should treat everyone respectfully, but according to the images in this video, this seems not to be the case. I am told that this particular woman was coming to the aid of her mother, a street vendor who apparently didn&#039;t have the proper permits, but that is no reason for the authorities to treat this particular New Yorker without the courtesy she deserves. We are sending a letter to Parks asking them to investigate this case. Just to clarify, the 110th Police Precinct was not involved in the incident.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp7oYUV8jrY&amp;feature=share" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp7oYUV8jrY&amp;feature=share</a>

					Please, read this article published by StreetsblogNYC regarding plans to expand the school speed camera program in the City. I will be pushing in Albany to make this a reality. We need more school speed cameras to protect schoolchildren and all New Yorkers.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/05/03/at-vision-zero-symosium-de-blasio-says-hell-push-albany-for-more-school-speed-cameras/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://nyc.streetsblog.org/2017/05/03/at-vision-zero-symosium-de-blasio-says-hell-push-albany-for-more-school-speed-cameras/</a>

					First, I want to thank you for your civic action in Albany, as well as for taking the time to visit my office. I appreciate your efforts, as they are extremely important in furthering important causes like the New York Health Act. <br /><br />Regarding the Act, I continue to be a cosponsor of the legislation, as are my colleagues in the Independent Democratic Conference. I believe strongly in the provisions contained within the bill, and I assure you that if the legislation makes its way to the Senate Floor, that I will be more than supportive of the measure. However, I also want to take the time to discuss what actually occurred last Sunday evening. The mainline Democratic Conference offered a hostile amendment that would have attached the Act onto the budget agreement that was already in place between the Governor, Senate leadership, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. Members did not vote on the bill itself, but rather on the question of whether the amendment was &quot;germane&quot; to the underlying legislation under the Senate Rules. <br /><br />In what has become a form of procedural grandstanding for the mainline Democrats, this amendment was offered even though it was clear that the requisite votes needed to pass the measure were not on the Floor. In fact, two members of the Mainline Democrats were not in attendance for the vote last Sunday, and Senator Simcha Felder -- who actually does caucus with the Republican Conference -- also did not vote for the measure. Even if the entire IDC did vote in favor of the hostile amendment, it would have still failed by three votes. This insincere gamesmanship has been demonstrated by the mainline Democrats time and time again, in an effort to distract the public from the positive provisions in legislation that is advancing. <br /><br />When the New York Health Act does come to the Floor as a legislative item, rather than a disingenuous hostile amendment, I fully intend to vote for this bill that I cosponsor. I strongly believe in the availability of quality healthcare for each and every New Yorker, and this is an issue that I am excited to continue pushing in the Senate. <br /><br />Again, please accept my many thanks for your efforts and if you would like to discuss this issue further in person, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office to set up a time to talk.

					From State Senator Jose Peralta: <br /><br />I am proud to report a great deal of good news that came out of this year’s New York State’s Budget. It was an arduous and long process, and although it is not a perfect budget, it is one that I am pleased with, as it contains several groundbreaking initiatives. I, and members of the Independent Democratic Conference, promised to deliver for all New Yorkers in the State’s budget, and we fulfilled that promise. We were successful in bringing more education funding, money to protect our immigrants, increased services for those most in need among us, greater job-training programs for New Yorkers, as well as free college tuition for qualifying students at SUNY and CUNY schools.<br /><br />Please, read more by following this link: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenatorJosePeralta/posts/710180719143212" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/SenatorJosePeralta/posts/710180719143212</a>

					Statement from Senator Jose Peralta regarding the approval of the State&#039;s budget: <br /><br />While this budget is not perfect, and no budget is, this is a plan that we can be proud of. I am pleased to announce that my colleagues and I in Independent Democratic Conference were able to secure $10 million in funding for immigration legal defense services, in a groundbreaking and coordinated effort to fight President Trump’s attacks on our vibrant communities. So too, I am glad that we are finally acting to Raise The Age of criminal responsibility in New York State for children ages 16 and 17; everyone deserves a second chance and fair shot at reaching a bright future. Additionally, I am proud to report that we secured a historic increase in overall school aid of about $1 billion, which includes a $700 million increase in foundation aid to public schools, bringing the annual appropriation for foundation aid to approximately $1.1 billion dollars. Assuming that these funds are allocated proportionally by the City of New York, my District would receive approximately $18.3 million for our public schools. Without adequately funded public schools, schoolchildren across the City are placed at a severe disadvantage. Again, while this budget accomplishes a great deal of good, there are several issues that remain on the table. As the legislative session continues, I will be fighting hard in Albany to tie up these loose ends, and to deliver comprehensive policy reforms that enshrine the ideals of equality and fairness that this great State was built upon.

					Daily News: Looking to fight back against President Trump’s immigration policies, the state is set to dedicate $10 million in its emerging new budget for immigrant legal services, the Daily News has learned. The commitment, to be announced by Gov. Cuomo and the eight-member Senate Independent Democratic Conference, is said to be the largest of its kind in state history.<br /><br />“The IDC is committed to helping immigrants as a part of this year&#039;s budget process, and this is a clear, unquestionable way of doing just that,” <strong>said Sen. Jose Peralta</strong>.<br /><br />Link to entire article: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-dedicating-10-million-immigration-legal-services-article-1.3020676" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-dedicating-10-million-immigration-legal-services-article-1.3020676</a>

					Statement from State Senator Jose Peralta: <br /><br />A few weeks ago, the mainline Democrats engaged in a outrageous public relations stunt designed to spread misinformation and confuse the people who care most about this issue. A hostile amendment is not a vote for Foundation Aid funding, it is a vote on whether or not an issue is relevant to a bill it is attached to — and the Senate Democrats deliberately selected one that had nothing to do with education. By the numbers this was a political game made to fail since the GOP holds a majority, but furthermore since Foundation Aid contains fiscal implications the Senate Democrats know it is a matter being handled in the New York State budget due April 1.<br /><br />I have supported the Campaign for Fiscal Equity throughout my legislative career. <strong>It is offensive to the core for anyone to say I voted against CFE funding</strong> when no such vote occurred. <em>We vote on a budget on April 1</em>.<br /><br /><em><strong>I support $1.4 billion for Foundation Aid</strong></em> with a phase-in in this year’s budget. I have always fought for building more schools to add more seats and&nbsp; eliminate decades-old classroom trailers that are not conducive to a real learning environment for our children. I pushed hard to obtain a record-setting amount of bond money to help our local schools. <br /><br />In the 13th Senate District <strong>my advocacy has led to new nine schools with 4,693 seats and four new schools with 2,871 seats</strong> that are in the pipeline to alleviate the severe overcrowding. For the mainline Democrats to pull this public relations stunt for the purpose of trying to deceive my constituents is very sad.
