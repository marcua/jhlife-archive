				I have issued my 4Q2013 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report (sorry for the delay, the city was tardy in updating the public record) which highlights a very good year for sales and a positive upward trend, especially for apartments.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy by subscribing on www.jhrealestatereport.com<br /><br />Here is a brief synopsis:<br /><br />2013 was certainly the “turnaround” year, when both sales volumes and average sales prices increased.&nbsp; Sales of houses in the 11372 zip code, while essentially flat to 2012, experienced much higher average sales prices across the board when compared with 2012.&nbsp; Apartment sales rose dramatically, to 429, up 50% from 2012.&nbsp; The trend increased quarter by quarter, and fourth quarter 2013 sales were the highest in over seven years.&nbsp; While the number of sales rose dramatically, average sales price increases were more moderate, rising by no more than 11% in any category.&nbsp; Demand for larger apartments drove prices past pre-financial crisis peaks.&nbsp; For the first time ever, six-room units at Hawthorne Court passed the $700,000 mark.&nbsp; Seven room units at The Towers and The Chateau, in less renovated condition, sold for just under the $700,000 level.&nbsp; <br /><br />As prices rose elsewhere – especially Manhattan and “brownstone” Brooklyn - Jackson Heights, especially its historic district, also benefited.&nbsp; Interestingly, buyers of both houses and large apartments have come from not only outside the neighborhood, but from existing residents as well.&nbsp; This bodes well for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.&nbsp; No one knows the neighborhood like I do!<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />
