				There&#039;s a new wine bar opening on northern blvd and 82 st next to Gianni&#039;s pizza. The sign says &quot;Bocaito wine bar coming soon/ the best place for brunch&quot; (or something like that). Can&#039;t wait to try them out! Anyone know anything else about the new restaurant?

				Any updates? I saw a storefront at 81-05 Northern that said GRAPEVINE, but the only listing I see for that is as a wine distributor, not a bar.....<br />

				I went around 1pm today and they were closed despite having a large Grand Opening sign. There weren&#039;t any hours posted. Their yelp page is up though: http://m.yelp.com/biz/bocaito-wine-bar-jackson-heights <br /><br />Anyone know when they&#039;re opening?

				We stopped in for drinks, they are really friendly and are interested in feedback from the community.&nbsp; They get their cheese and meats from Despana.&nbsp; &nbsp;I definitely recommend that everyone stop by to check them out and welcome them to the neighborhood.&nbsp; They will be having brunch next week!

				Really nice place!&nbsp; Very happy they are here. There will be a small backyard in the summer. Go and check them out. We had some wine and appetizers. They are trying brunch this Sunday.&nbsp; Everybody&#039;s been crying for a wine bar, a cocktail bar, now you&#039;ve got one. Go and support them!

				I was elated when I saw this opening up so close to me and I must say, my expectations were met and then some.&nbsp; <br />The place has great ambiance and decor.&nbsp; The bartenders definitely know what they are doing, I&#039;m looking forward to trying some of their signature cocktails.&nbsp; I got an Old Fashioned which was done very well.&nbsp; My girlfriend was pleased with the wine she ordered and their overall selection.&nbsp; <br /><br />The food we tried was excellent.&nbsp; We had the empanaditas from the appetizer menu, these were great.&nbsp; We also ordered the seafood/chicken/chorizo Paella which comes with a lobster claw in the center.&nbsp; I especially enjoyed the chorizo in the Paella. <br /><br />Overall this is a great addition to the neighborhood.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t yet, check it out!!

				Had a terrific brunch at Bocaito today.&nbsp; This brand new wine bar on Northern Blvd. and 83rd serves a delicious brunch that includes two drinks, coffee, appetizer and entree for $19.00.&nbsp; Had a wonderful salad, steak and eggs with potatoes and two bloody marys.&nbsp; Food was fresh and beautifully plated.&nbsp; Finally a very good brunch spot has arrived in Jackson Heights.

				I completely agree.&nbsp; Food, service, atmosphere, all amazing.&nbsp; My daughter loved their chalk wall, where kids are welcome to pick up chalk and draw.&nbsp; &nbsp;Such a brilliant idea. Their specialty drinks looks great as well. Looks like the bartenders know what they&#039;re doing. They hope by the end of the month to have their out door space up and running. I have a sneaking suspicion that will be very hard to get a table for brunch by the end of the summer once popularity picks up.<br /><br />It&#039;s so nice to write this review. Normally I find myself writing reviews that have some disappointments but not in this case!

				Glad to hear that the new place is nice. Be great to try it, though I hope they have less expensive options. $19 for brunch strikes me as pricey if you don&#039;t care to have two drinks. <br /><br />

				Had Brunch there a few weeks ago and even though yelp says they are closed on Sundays they are not. Good drinks, food was very good. Service was a little slow, but they were very friendly. I&#039;d say just working out the kinks of a new restaurant. Welcome to the neighborhood.

				Hi all, new to this board, have been in Jackson Heights for about a year now. I went to Bocaito for dinner last week and it was really lovely. My friend and I sat outside in the back garden space and shared several dishes tapas style. The ceviche mixto, pandebono with crab meat fondue, and yuca gratinada were especially good. The service wasn&#039;t especially quick but our server was more than competent and friendly, and in any case we weren&#039;t in any hurry (the dishes and drinks were coming out a bit slowly, but that wasn&#039;t the server&#039;s fault). I&#039;ll definitely be back! <br />

				Went here for brunch on Sunday and it was wonderful. Fresh food, prepared by someone who knows how to cook (REAL bernaise sauce--not from a powdered mix), great spicy Bloody Marys, and everything attractively presented. All those who complain that they want great food in Jackson Heights, go to Bocaito and support this restaurant so that we don&#039;t lose it. You will not be disappointed.

				Just wanted to get a read on people regarding Bocaito and brunch, as I had an interesting experience there.<br /><br />The good:&nbsp; black bean soup was amazing.<br /><br />The strange:&nbsp; their &#039;traditional&#039; eggs benedict came with cinnamon raison english muffins.&nbsp; I inquired the waitress about it and she believed it was a mistake.&nbsp; I hope so, but it seems kind of a rookie error.<br /><br />The not so good:&nbsp; 20 dollars for brunch seems a bit high.&nbsp; So does 15 dollars for kids brunch.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy it&#039;s here. And i look forward to trying their non brunch entrees.&nbsp; And i&#039;ll give their brunch another shot, but the price point seems a bit high.

				I agree that the price is high for brunch.&nbsp; It&#039;s because it includes two drinks.<br /><br />The food is great and the ambiance is lovely.&nbsp; I am encouraging them to have a lower-priced brunch for those who don&#039;t want an alcoholic drink or want only one.&nbsp; Maybe if enough of us mention this, they will comply.&nbsp; They certainly seem like they want to accommodate their customers.

				Can&#039;t speak to the brunch service but the dinner left a lot to be desired. Cocktails are creative and delicious, and the backyard patio is very pleasant. But the ceviche was clearly made from frozen shrimp, as were the side vegetables we learned as we walked by the kitchen on the way out. I just can&#039;t justify a $20 entree that was thawed out.

We were there earlier this year and it was pretty good. At first they had some annoying boom boom music playing but then when they realized there were a bunch of older people in the yard they changed it up to some quieter adult alternative.<br /><br />We had a good time and the food was good. I was in the mood for chicken snack so I had some naked wings. They were tasty. She had some shredded pork buns it looked like it&#039;s been too long for me to remember exactly what it was and I can&#039;t find a menu online. The drinks were also good.
