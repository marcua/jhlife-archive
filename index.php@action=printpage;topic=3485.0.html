				I live right by Mexicana, and I&#039;ve always liked them. The cars are clean and the drivers are courteous. Since their office is always open (at least it seems to be) I just walk in and they have a car for me within 2 minutes - it ends up being like a taxi dispatch stand for me. Since my dog is too big to fit in a bag, and thus can&#039;t be taken on the subway, I use them to shuttle my pup back and forth to Manhattan when she needs to get there. <br /><br />7018 35th Ave<br />Jackson Heights, NY 11372-3936<br />(718) 446-8700

				I second Mexicana (I think there was a similar thread somewhere?).<br /><br />My BF has used them to go to the airport several times and I&#039;ve used them around Queens generally.&nbsp; They&#039;re reasonably priced, clean, and show up on time.

				Here&#039;s the other thread<br /><br />Car Service &nbsp;(http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=183.0).<br /><br />It&#039;s one to two years old so I&#039;m not going to merge them, but I think &nbsp;most of the info in the old thread is still valid and useful.

				I usually call Continental. The guy always says they&#039;ll be there in five to seven minutes and, 90 percent of the time, he&#039;s right. Nice drivers, too.

				I tried Mexicana last time, and they came right on time and got me to the airport without a problem, BUT they don&#039;t take credit cards.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not much, but when I travel for work, I hate putting out my own cash to do so and it&#039;s easy to forget how much I&#039;m spending so I can be reimbursed.<br /><br />So, do any of these car services accept credit cards?&nbsp;
