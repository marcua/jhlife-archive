				These are screenshots from videos posted to the Citizen App last night as a car crashed into Corazones Restaurant by 86th St and Roosevelt Ave. It appears that the car backed up into the restaurant. I didn&#039;t see information about diners seated outdoors when this happened. I hope there weren&#039;t any. <br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/Vvhdtqo.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/42UoXnf.jpg)

				This is sickening. <br />From the looks of it, there was on street seating, as there is a plywood base in the photo. Also, the vehicle is front first. To me, that cries, U-Turn gone awry. This is horribly upsetting.

				My friend saw it while she was walking her dog. She said that the SUV went full throttle in reverse down 87th street, and didn&#039;t event try to stop.

				When I see how close the majority outdoor seatings are so close to the ongoing Roosevelt traffic , I knew something tragic would&nbsp; happen. Now Iâ€™m even more afraid to dine outdoor ;(

				I knew it was just a matter of time until something like this happened. Dangerous to be sitting in traffic, with drivers being so impatient and all the horn honking. Not great ambience. I support these places but think this is dangerous.

				I hope everyone is okay. Dining on the street like this does not appeal to me whatsoever. Not only are there dangers from vehicles, but so many other people walking by, as well.
