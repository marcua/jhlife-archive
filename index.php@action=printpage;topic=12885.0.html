				It looks like we&#039;ll be having another empty storefront on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; There&#039;s a &quot;For Rent&quot; sign at the Prima Donna store located on the corner of 80th street (pretty sure it&#039;s 80th).&nbsp; This doesn&#039;t surprise me, as the store had been advertising liquidation sales for quite a while now.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pretty large space, so it&#039;ll be interesting to see what comes next.&nbsp; Of course, some kind of eatery would be awesome, but that would require a complete kitchen installation... a large investment by any interested party.

				Yes, they have a store on 82nd.&nbsp; I imagine they are just going to have the one, instead of paying two rents.&nbsp; Fever also seems to be closing.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; They did that a few months ago and then opened up with different merchandise layout.&nbsp; Which was worse and way uglier than what they had previously.

				I heard that it was going to be an outpost for Caffe Bene (I am not sure if I spelled that correctly) which is a coffee bar chain. Oddly, the only time I was in one was on a recent family vacation in Ho Chi Minh City. Because of the French influence, Vietnam has a huge coffee culture. Went into the Caffe Bene with my daughter and commented on the great coffee in Vietnam, and she told me this was an international chain with locations in NYC and not Vietnamese at all! They did have great coffee, an attractive shop, and comfortable seating.

				ah, I heard Cafe Bene might be coming.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s a chain but actually a pretty nice one--I have hung out at outposts in Manhattan and Astoria before.&nbsp; Good coffee, good snacks, lots of seating,&nbsp; good hang.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t be a bad addition to 37th (and handle some of the overflow from Starbucks which is always jammed.)

				there are a bunch in manhattan, one not too far from my office, which is sort of on the fringe of tribeca and chinatown. it&#039;s your basic coffee chain, but at least it&#039;s not a bank!

				There&#039;s one in Sunnyside on Queens Blvd already. I&#039;m a little more excited about Espresso 77 expanding. Haven&#039;t really spent much time there, since I don&#039;t have a stroller and have no desire to take my laptop for a nice walk. All to say, it&#039;s been a struggle to grab a seat, apparently everyone else in the world has free time when I have free time.<br /><br />I am amused by the play of Bene (good) and Bean, I will always call this place Coffee Bean.<br /><br />And sort of apropos, at the gig Tuesday we were kicking around the oxymoronic concept of &quot;local chain&quot;....

				I agree that the expansion of E77 is wonderful news. They have so much more to offer than the generic coffee bar thing, but since Starbucks is always packed I figure there is ample room for another place like that, and hopefully one that is better than Starbucks. <br /><br />There are so many new, smaller coffee chains that are great: Cafe Grumpy, Gregory&#039;s, Stumptown, etc. I&#039;d choose one of those over a bigger chain, but I think this is a nice addition anyway. <br /><br />E77 is more than just a coffee bar, and with the expansion it will offer more food and drink options. It&#039;s just great. I recommend checking out their Indiegogo renovation fundraising campaign. I&#039;m planning to donate today.

				One cafe expanding and another one opening--this is a lot of news for one day! Caffe Bene is from Korea, like Tous Les Jours and Paris Baguette. I liked their Americano a lot.
