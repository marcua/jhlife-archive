				Does anyone know what will be replacing the Hallmark store on 82nd St between 37th and Roosevelt?&nbsp; It looks like they&#039;re doing a lot of work in there, including some work in the green space behind the store.

				In my fantasies it&#039;s going to be some kind of restaurant with outdoor seating since I saw them removing trees from the green space behind the store.&nbsp; That&#039;s probably too much to hope for though.&nbsp; More realistically, it&#039;ll most likely be another drug store.

				It stinks that they closed &gt;:(&nbsp; Every year we&#039;d get our ornaments there and collectibles. The owner was extremely nice. He does still have a store in Woodhaven but thats a hike.. Rite aid sells cards and so does the deals store on northern for real cheap!

				No one is bashing immigrant businesses.&nbsp; We are just tired of having pharmacies and banks open on every corner because of greedy landlords who price everyone else out (including other immigrants).&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you hear anyone complaining about immigrant-run bakeries or ethnic restaurants or the jewelry shops or electronics businesses?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Because we aren&#039;t overrun with them.&nbsp; We just want some variety, and I&#039;m sure everyone here would be happy to see a new immigrant business open up that is just something else other than the usual 99 cent store.&nbsp; <br /><br />Regarding your comment about &quot;opening a business yourself&quot; - do you have any clue what the commercial rents are around here?&nbsp; It&#039;s nearly impossible for anyone other than the aforementioned pharamices, etc.. to be able to make the rent.&nbsp;

				There is no chance for a bookstore in Jackson Heights so long as people patronize the street vendor who plys his trade in front of Met Food on 76th Street.&nbsp; Why would anyone take on the financial risk of renting space for a book store with the Internet and street vendors?&nbsp; It just won&#039;t happen... and certainly not with the commercial rents on 82nd Street.&nbsp; Remember, to vote with your dollars!

				With the closure of Borders chain it seems as if the brick-and-mortar bookstore is virtually assured of becoming a thing of the past, but I have to say that I now read more than ever since buying my iPad earlier this year. I&#039;m always downloading a new book, and read several magazines, as well as my digital subscription to the NY Times on a daily basis. So the publishing industry isn&#039;t necessarily dying, but rather going through a rapid evolution into a digital format. (I will say the one major drawback of this evolution is the inability to lend someone else that copy of the great book you just finished reading.)

				Actually before there was an alphabet or papyrus on which to write, much of what we know of the ancient civilizations you mentioned is thanks to a rich tradition of <strong>oral</strong> storytelling. Epic poems were recited and handed down from generation to generation before they were finally transcribed (and later translated) for our benefit.

				I noticed a number of stores vacant in Woodside and Astoria earlier in the week and judging from the surrounding businesses, I think<br />these are lower rent areas. Wish we could stimulate the economy more with retail that we really want here in Jackson Heights rather<br />than carrying bags home on the subways. Well-made products, good value, appealing look to consumers, scarcity in area. Someone<br />has to have this capacity as an entreprenuer???

				Taggie, i love those ideas, and i would love to see them put into practice<br /><br />but i wonder how practical that is in this sort of economy -- or, frankly, with the regular American mindset, which emphasizes saving 10% over patronizing a neighbor, or even getting a good product. i buy local and mom n pop at every opportunity, and it&#039;s nice to see other people feel that way too.
