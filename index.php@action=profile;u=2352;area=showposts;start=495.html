					Wow I forgot to mention the hoochie clothing!<br /><br />Seriously though, It is true that unless some serious street level marketing research is done, there is no definitive answer on what type of stores should or shouldn&#039;t be in this neighborhood. &nbsp;Nor will there ever be. Though I think dssjh you already provided the answer. &nbsp;<br /><br />I used to live in Harlem, and most people didn&#039;t have a problem with all the hair salons, chinese food joints with bullet proof glass, and bodegas with one rotten head of lettuce, if that. &nbsp;However it has been ten years since I lived on that block, and now there is a coffee shop, upscale deli, and fancy restaurant there. &nbsp;Neighborhoods change, and Jackson Heights is more dynamic than most. <br /><br />Maybe this is an issue of gentrification. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think so. &nbsp;When my friend&#039;s parents grew up here it was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. &nbsp;The gentleman who inspected the apartment I live in (yes I am a homeowner here, so I am vested and do believe in this neighborhood) lived in Jax Heights when it was war barracks post WWII for returning veterans.<br /><br />There is no &quot;dealing.&quot; &nbsp;Thats a jaded and response. &nbsp;This is a dynamic neighborhood, with a lot to offer to many people. &nbsp;The fact that there are, as you say &quot;dozens&quot; of emails pertaining to this topic shows me that there is a large element to this fantastic neighborhood that is not being serviced. &nbsp;Theres your marketing research right there. &nbsp;As Daniel Dromm said, there is a bit of a baby boom going on in Jackson Heights now. &nbsp;Young families are moving in. &nbsp;If there needs aren&#039;t met, then there dollar unfortunately goes elsewhere. &nbsp;<br /><br />Some people see this. &nbsp;There has been real estate campaigns in both Williamsburg (&quot;Billyburg, Meet Jax Heights&quot;) and Park Slope (&quot;More Park, Less Slope&quot;) to try and attract people from those neighborhoods who might see a benefit to the value and beauty of Jackson Heights. &nbsp;<br /><br />I don&#039;t think this neighborhood will ever fully lose its character for great ethnic food. &nbsp;For the forseeable future there will most likely be Indian, Columbian, Tibetan, Nepalese and Thai food here. &nbsp;Just like Astoria will always be great for greek food, and Harlem for soul food, even if the cuisine becomes more diversified. &nbsp;Jackson Heights will not lose, nor be hurt by further culinary diversity. &nbsp;These &quot;Dozens&quot; of strains prove that there is a market. &nbsp;<br /><br />Change, I feel, is inevitable here. &nbsp;Deal with that....

					Interesting points Jhilfer.&nbsp; I was unaware of these laws.&nbsp; And yes, Kennedy Fried Chicken is associated with poorer neighborhoods.&nbsp; Even if this joint isn&#039;t related to those, it has a similar name and sells the same stuff.&nbsp; I was upset when I found out what that space was to become.&nbsp; Plus, with all the schools around that part of the hood, the owners are certainly hoping to capitalize on kids wanting fatty, cheap fast food options.&nbsp; Not the way to go, I feel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Yeah, Mehfil....great Navratan Curry.&nbsp; Sad to see it go.&nbsp; With that being said I was saddened to see yet another Tandoori restaurant going up in its place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I forgot to mention one other business that I feel &quot;Gets It.&quot;&nbsp; That would be &quot;La Gloria&quot; on Northern Boulevard and 86th Street.&nbsp; Best brunch in the hood with food that features an interesting play on traditional Cuban fare.&nbsp; During Brunch they usually have DJs spinning tunes.&nbsp; On the weekend you can also catch some live Cuban music.&nbsp; The inside design is also beautiful, with a bathroom to write home about.&nbsp;

					Jeff, I&#039;ve heard good things about Fresca La Crepe, and have dined and listened to music at Cukoos Nest. &nbsp;What I am speaking specifically about is Jackson Heights. <br /><br />Madalyn, for a good bistro I would consider Uncle Peters in the 80s on Northern.<br /><br />&nbsp;I also find it hard to believe that rents would be higher in JH over, say, 30th ave in Astoria. &nbsp;Also, within Jax Heights the rent varies. &nbsp;For instance, the higher you go streetwise the lower the rent. &nbsp;Hence, Heads Ain&#039;t Ready moving to 81st street. &nbsp;What I think it boils down to is a restauranteur willing to take a risk. &nbsp;Someone at some point in Astoria said, &quot;Hey, maybe we don&#039;t need another greek joint. &nbsp;Maybe something different would work!&quot; &nbsp;JH is already a foodie destination, but I just think it could be more. &nbsp;What we don&#039;t need is another &quot;A La Brasa&quot; or Tandoori Chicken House. &nbsp;For that matter we don&#039;t need another eyeglass joint, hair salon, cell phone or dollar store. &nbsp;I know many of you agree. &nbsp;IMO it would be the joint that breaks through in a different direction that would be extremely successful. &nbsp;And as far as overhead, food does have a low profit margin, but liquor rakes in the profits. &nbsp;This neighborhood deserves a great neighborhood bar and hang! &nbsp;<br /><br />Daisy, you do have good points. &nbsp;Don&#039;t get me wrong, I support Jax Heights and want to see it grow. &nbsp;As far as disappointing store fronts and rent, there is this thrift store on 81st and 37th that for at least three years has had VHS tapes like Alf, the third season in its storefront. &nbsp;There is also a fabric store on 37th that has nothing but a couple rolls of fabric in its window. &nbsp;How these places make it I don&#039;t get it. &nbsp;<br /><br />When speaking of Non-ethnic businesses in Jax Heights, I feel there are only four businesses that &quot;get it.&quot; &nbsp;Those would be Espresso 77, Table Wine, The Lemon Farm and Inner Peace. &nbsp;They have well designed and inviting businesses (I wish E77 was bigger!!) with interesting and diverse products and a hip flair. &nbsp;JUST MADE 4 U sort of gets it by including crepes on their menu, but they need to diversify further. &nbsp;For instance, there is only one chicken crepe option, and its slathered in a cream sauce. &nbsp;If they really wanted to step it up they would also work on their breakfast options. &nbsp;Lety Bakery sorta gets it, but I have had some stale pastries there, as well as a red velvet that was more pink than red. &nbsp;They could take a note from Marthas in Forest Hills or Astoria to see how it is really done. &nbsp;BTW, has anyone noticed that there is nowhere to get a good muffin in the hood? &nbsp;Alas, I digress.<br /><br />In summary, the above mentioned businesses have only been around a few years at best. &nbsp;The neighborhood will change, eventually. &nbsp;Look, in 1995 astoria was not trendy, L.I.C and Williamsburg were sketchy, and Park Slope (in many ways our sister historic neighborhood in Bklyn) was just beginning to shine. &nbsp;Jackson Heights has so many great things to offer already, and I feel strongly that it will only get better. &nbsp;<br />

					I, meaning me and my wife, totally agree with Madalyn.&nbsp; We both come from Astoria, and were a bit spoiled by the diversity of eats in that neighborhood.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has great food, but I would love to see a diversity in types of restaurants.&nbsp; And yes, how bout a great Irish pub like Sweet Afton, that families can go to during the day and get great eats, and people can go to and socialize at night over a pint?&nbsp; E77 is great and gets it, but lets face it....it feels a bit cramped.&nbsp; It should be two or three times the size, and then I would frequent it more.&nbsp; .Or how bout a trendy joint or two, with some new and exciting types of cuisine a la Ovelia or Bare Burger in Astoria?&nbsp; I think there is a market, no a need for these types of restaurants in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; They have em in Sunnyside, Woodside, LIC, Forest Hills, etc, and if I had money I would invest in something new and exciting here because I think it would make a killing.&nbsp;

					Had brunch at Novo a few years back.&nbsp; It left much room for improvement.&nbsp; Scones probably would&#039;ve been tasty if not strangely soggy, like waiter spilled water on them.&nbsp; And when we asked for hot tea they said they didn&#039;t have.&nbsp; Who has a brunch with no hot tea?&nbsp; <br /><br />So, now it looks like they have reinstated brunch.&nbsp; I hope this time they get it right, because we could use a good, non-diner brunch option.<br /><br />

					Went to Jax Inn for the first time.&nbsp; Overall, our experience was positive/mixed.&nbsp; They were packed solid for Sunday brunch, which was nice to see.&nbsp; The menu selection is traditional diner, with a few nice touches that I&#039;m looking forward to trying (mac and cheese!).&nbsp; Our waiter seemed pleasant, but new and a bit overwhelmed.&nbsp; For instance, when I asked for the soup of the day he had to go to the kitchen to ask, and when our food came, nobody came over to ask how our meal was.&nbsp; My wife had a chicken salad and she thought it was great.&nbsp; I started with the Matzoh ball, which only came with broth and matzoh balls (Mark Twain was the same way), while i was hoping for maybe some celery, carrot, noodles or chicken (as in Ben&#039;s Best).&nbsp; I ventured to try the vegetable pannini (Sanfords in Astoria makes an amazing one)&nbsp; which was OK.&nbsp; This one was little too oily, and heavy on carrots. I would have preferred more like eggplant, squash, etc.&nbsp; The slaw and pickles were nice.&nbsp; The fries tasted fine, but the ketchup was off...consistency and color-wise.....weird right?&nbsp; Both my wife and I felt that way.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you order a traditional sandwich you can choose fries or mixed greens......I love to have the option, even if salad is more.&nbsp; But if you order any of the other types of sandwiches you do not get this option...another weird thing right?&nbsp; So when my wife asked for mixed greens or a side salad with her sandwich, we were charged $6.00 for a small salad.&nbsp; I questioned the waiter and he said the same salad large would cost $8.00.&nbsp; Still seems like a lot for a small salad.&nbsp; I did mention this to the young woman at the counter and she agreed with me.&nbsp; At Jackson House or Jahn&#039;s you can get a side salad for cheaper.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, on the whole I am happy that there is a 24/7 diner in the hood.&nbsp; It is obvious that a lot of time and money was spent on the renovations.&nbsp; Being that it is new I am hoping that it will work out its kinks and emerge victorious.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;
