				This home has real potential. If I were looking to buy it would pique my interest for sure. If the board approved the plan, a buyer could open up the kitchen, turn the dining room into a third bedroom, and add real closets and a second bath.<br /><br />This floor plan is identical to a home that&#039;s in contract for $499k on StreetEasy at 35-20 82nd Street, #41. I like to reimagine the space as either a large 2-Br or a 3 BR:<br /><br />https://renov8or.blogspot.com/2017/12/fixer-upper-friday-2br-convertible-to.html#

				Yesâ€”very pricey! <br /><br />I&#039;m puzzled by his suggestion of dropping the ceiling in two rooms. Most people (I think) would rather not lose ceiling height in NYC apartments. He&#039;s also suggesting installing recessed lighting, so maybe the dropped ceiling is to accommodate that? (Personally, I detest recessed lighting, but it certainly is very trendy...for now.)

				i agree with Simka...having lived with dropped ceilings in Astoria and Bed Stuy many years ago, i find them claustrophobia-inducing.

				Yes high ceilings are a wonderful feature of pre-war apartments--it seems crazy to drop the ceilings in order to have recessed lighting. There are other ways to have good lighting. Not sure this designer is really attuned to the aesthetic of these buildings.
