			Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m a JH renter of several years now looking at 1BR apts in 1930s buildings.<br /><br />This apt at the Mayfair does not have the original parquet floor.<br /><br />https://streeteasy.com/building/35_20-73-street-jackson_heights/2j<br /><br />My questions to those with flooring experience are:<br /><br />What is this stuff, from the look of it?<br /><br />In your experience, might the original hardwood be underneath?<br /><br />Is it worth replacing ~600sf of the foyer, living room, and bedroom and hall floor with something better?<br /><br />Are there creative design solutions beyond covering as much as possible with carpet or rug?

			It is hard to tell from photos alone, but that appears to be laminate flooring:<br /><br />https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-laminate-flooring-1821619<br /><br />It is possible the original floor is underneath, but you won&#039;t know if it is and if it is worth refinishing until you remove the laminate. You might be able to get some information through the broker if the current owner put the flooring in. You may also be able to find photos from when the apartment was last listed for sale - this often provides some clues. <br /><br />If it is worth it to replace is a question only you can answer. I am guessing the flooring bothers you if you are posting these questions. You may be able to negotiate a lower price based on the fact that you can&#039;t live with that floor. <br /><br />Good luck with your search!

			My guess is it&#039;s either a vinyl laminate or engineered hardwood (really, a different kind of laminate.) My understanding of parquet floors is that it&#039;s thin, so my guess would be the current owners decided it was better to just float another floor on top of it. (they might have ripped it out though) If you want to rip everything up and add a hard wood floor, I think you&#039;re going to need the space for a subfloor, which may not be there. <br /><br />From the photos, it looks fine and in good condition. I probably wouldn&#039;t bother replacing what already looks pretty decent considering the cost and hassle of replacing floors. You&#039;ll likely be putting down rugs anyway, if only to dampen sound within the apartment and add some softness (if they floated a floor, there&#039;s probably already an underlayment there that meetings the coop&#039;s floor covering rules), so my guess is unless it&#039;s really awful, you won&#039;t even notice the floor all that much if you buy and move in.

			&nbsp;I actually live in the sister building, the Surrey and someone just replaced the floors for about 17k I think. Pretty big job. I wouldn&#039;t replace them because you have to have carpeting anyways, and the extra layer of laminate probably dampens sounds too (the floors are pretty thin as it is. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I have been very happy here, super close to the subway, close enough to Travers Park, close to the BQE. Board and management is not annoying.. Worst part is the the traffic backup from little india/bangladesh and the litter from the non-locals that go there. My building has a great mix of people that largely keep to themselves, though friendly.

Pretty big job. <br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />It&#039;s a little bit lower than what I would expect. Was this job done recently? The other thread was talking about 100K renovation. I understand different apartment sizes may have different costs.&nbsp; Considering the total cost of this apartment is already more than $300K. 17K is about 5-6% of the price of the apartment.
