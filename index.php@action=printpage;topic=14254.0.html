				This is a great question! <br /><br /><br />Another one ---- What is the difference between Soul food and Southern food?<br /><br /><br />Planesland has the textbook definition, a great definition. But some other questions might be, is soul food comfort food? How can, and has, Soul food changed? As far as chicken and waffles ---- that is a Harlem invention -- maybe a Northern interpretation or evolution of soul food. Or maybe soul isn&#039;t necessarily south?

In the Great Migration between 1910 and 1970, millions of those African-Americans moved from the agricultural South to the industrial North, bringing their soul food traditions with them. This made areas like Harlem, South Central Los Angeles, and the South Side of Chicago centers of soul food. As that was nearly a hundred years ago, there have been many generations of soul food in these cities by now!<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)

				My own personal definition of &quot;soul food&quot; is something that is so delicious and fun to eat that it seems to fill a neglected corner of my psyche.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually not&nbsp; the healthiest thing to eat, like chocolate, but it seems necessary every once in a blue moon.<br /><br />A big-ass plate of well-made Fettucini Alfredo would do it for me today!
