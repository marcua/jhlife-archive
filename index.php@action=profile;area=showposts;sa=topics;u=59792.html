					Each year the Jackson Heights Beautification Group hosts the JH Halloween Parade. &nbsp; Everyone is invited. &nbsp;<br /><br />‎Adults and children are encouraged to wear crazy costumes. We have some very creative folks in the neighborhood--each year I am amazed.<br /><br />Schools and other groups march together and are organized by different color balloons. JH Beautification Group inflates and hands out about 1,100 balloons that day. &nbsp; Groups meet up at 4:45 PM at 89th Street and 37th Avenue. This year the Grand Marshall of the parade is Ivan Rodriguez the new principal of our largest middle school, IS 145. The parade starts at 5 PM on the dot. We have bands from IS 230, IS 145 and PS 149 as well as a dance Troupe from IS 145.<br /><br />It can be a bit chaotic at the start of the parade to find people, so if you have a group that wants to march together, just show up with your own bouquet of balloons so you can find each other.<br /><br />There are few police barricades along the route, so you can join in at any point. We march from 89th Street &nbsp;to 77th Street along 37th Avenue where the Jackson Heights Beautification Group hands out goodie bags to all the kids that has a juice box and some candy. The bags can then be used to trick or treat along the stores along 37th Avenue and Roosevelt, but many are out of candy by the end of the parade as the little kids start trick-or-treating right after school.<br /><br />People watch from the sidewalk and cheer on the marchers. People are encouraged to bring nose makers and flying puppets. It is a great day to live in JH.<br /><br />Warnings:&nbsp;<br />1) traffic in JH is crazy from 4 PM to 8 PM so don&#039;t try to move your car. There is no parking on 37th Avenue the whole day (not sure why) but traffic stops at around 4 PM. 2) strollers are fine. Little kids often can&#039;t make it until the end, but you can join or leave the parade up until PS 69 (78th Street)<br /><br />The Jackson Heights Beautification Group is an all volunteer group that pays for and &nbsp;packs 3,500 goodie bags to distribute to kids and hands out over 1,000 balloons to groups. If you want to support this and all of our other efforts, please donate at <a href="http://www.JHBG.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.JHBG.org</a>.<br />

					This Election Day, there will be a number of propositions on the BACK of the ballot. <br /><br />Proposition 1 calls for a Constitutional Convention. This will cost the state millions and will allow a limited group the power to rewrite the State&#039;s Constitution. Who will represent you? Party leaders, the party machines, lobbyists, big business, and others who are not necessarily listening to you. Come and learn about the basic information that is needed to learn about what is really at stake.<br /><br />There will be an open community meeting - including a panel of those in favor and those opposed. <br />It will be this Thursday, October 12th @ 8pm at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />This is important for the future of NYS and it&#039;s residents<br /><br />see attachment<br />
