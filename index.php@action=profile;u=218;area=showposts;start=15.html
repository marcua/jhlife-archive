The fact is, were it not for MacDougall&#039;s vision of a community of upscale apartment dwellers, the architecture of Jackson Heights would not be nearly as beautiful or distinctive as it is. &nbsp;<br /><br />

It was a spontaneous declaration that particular ideas, expressions and behaviour, which were then legal, should be forbidden by law, and people who transgressed should be punished. (see Newspeak) It started with a few voices but grew in popularity until it became unwritten and written law within the community.
