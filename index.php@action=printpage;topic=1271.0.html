				I live in a house on 85th Street, we have a common back alley. We have spotted a very large raccoon in our back yards.<br />It does not seem to be overly fearful of people. If there is one then there is most likely to be more. I have seen them in Flushing and Forest Hills but never here.

				We had them around our house when I was a kid... for a while they were literally living in the chimney.&nbsp; They&#039;re smart and curious animals, and I&#039;ve always had a soft spot for them.&nbsp; Probably because of this book (http://www.amazon.com/Frosty-raccoon-remember-Harriett-Weaver/dp/0671298089).<br />

				I worked in Flushing Meadows Park for a while, and we had a family of Raccoons living in the building next to us (I named them Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue, and I think Uncle Norbit came to visit every now and then) I did a great deal of research in to them as we had workers going in and out of the building they lived in.<br /><br />It&#039;s illegal to kill them. <br /><br />Animal Care and Control will not remove them from any locations in NYC unless they are dead or injured. <br /><br />They are as smart if not smarter than the average dog. <br /><br />There are more rabid dogs in this country then there are rabid Raccoons.<br /><br />Coyote Urine powder doest not work to keep them away.<br /><br />Apparently, they hate tomatoes. <br /><br />The fact that they are becoming more common in residential areas is a cause for concern. The less they fear people the more dangerous it becomes for everyone involved. We took to barking and yelling at them, and that seemed to help until they got used to that too. Best way to deal with them I&#039;d say s give them a wide berth and keep on going.<br /><br />Of Course the other way to reduce the Raccoon population is to reduce or eliminate their food source, this is where keeping the streets clean becomes more than just aesthetics it&#039;s a matter of public safety.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I believe CSX refers to CSX Freight Trains.

				You might have better luck in Flushing Meadows Corona Park. They live near the theatre in the old NYState Pavilion. After about 7pm they come out and forage around the dumpsters.

				It was a bit more of a Pac Man Reference :) but yes, Stinky would be appropriate for a family of skunks. I wonder how long it will be before we see skunks in the area.

				Uh-oh...I might be the only human who never played PacMan.&nbsp; I would be willing to bet that there are already skunks around.&nbsp; They&#039;re pretty resourceful creatures and also nocturnal, like raccoons..

				Not quite a sloth, but once when my husband and I were driving down Ditmars towards JH, right before we reached the airport, an animal darted across the street. It had all these not-hairy patches, and we at first thought it was some sort of sick cat before we realized it was a possum with a bunch of possum babies hanging on her back for dear life! It was simultaneously one of the coolest yet grossest things I have ever seen!

				Raccoon Roundworm disease hits Brooklyn.<br /><br /><strong>New York Daily News</strong><br />Raccoon Roundworm disease hits Brooklyn teen and baby (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/05/03/2009-05-03_raccoon_disease_hits_brooklyn_teen__tot.html)<br />BY Veronika Belenkaya<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER<br /><br />Sunday, May 3rd 2009, 11:22 PM<br /><br />A rare, deadly disease that has left an infant brain damaged and a teenager blind in one eye, has been detected in Brooklyn, the Daily News has learned.<br /><br />The city&#039;s Department of Health is on alert for Raccoon Roundworm, a disease contracted through contact with raccoon feces. It can cause permanent nerve damage and death. The disease had previously been incorrectly called Raccoon Ringworm.<br /><br />&quot;Parents should closely supervise small children in areas where raccoons live to prevent possible ingestion of raccoon feces,&quot; said Sally Slavinski, of a Health Department unit that deals with diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans.<br /><br />In the first case, a healthy infant who traveled to upstate New York last year started having seizures and spinal problems last October. The baby has been brain-damaged and hospitalized ever since.<br /><br />Then, in January, a Brooklyn teen who hasn&#039;t left the city recently, lost sight in the right eye.<br /><br />Fewer than 30 cases of Raccoon Roundworm have been reported nationwide. It takes two to four weeks for symptoms, which include nausea, loss of coordination and muscle control, and blindness, to develop.<br /><br />News of the disease, which strikes mostly kids and especially developmentally disabled children, sent shivers through city playgrounds.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s terrifying. God only knows how I would react if my kids became that ill,&quot; said Bay Ridge mom of two, Angelia Kane, 38.<br /><br />&quot;The concern for me would be kids being kids. I have a 3-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy. When they&#039;re slightly out of sight, they&#039;re going to pick up something in the course of their normal behavior and put their filthy hands in their mouths.&quot;<br /><br />With the swine flu outbreak, Kane&#039;s kids have been washing their hands more often, but she said she won&#039;t keep them from going to the playground.<br /><br />&quot;If you spend enough time reading about all the things kids can contract you don&#039;t leave the house,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Still, Slavinski said parents should take other precautions.<br /><br />&quot;Raccoon feces should be removed using gloves and disposable bags, and placed in trash to keep from children,&quot; she said.

				Raccoons are not dangerous unless they are rabid <span class="bbc_u">and</span> they bite you.&nbsp; They usually are not aggressive so, if you see one, step out of its way.<br /><br />They are nocturnal creatures however so chances are, if you seeing one&nbsp; during daylight, it may be rabid.&nbsp; Rabid raccoons have a staggering gait, as if they are drunk.&nbsp; At this point, they are not long for this world so the problem will correct itself.&nbsp; Do not let your dog approach a raccoon at any time.

				I grew up in the forest and am pretty familiar with raccoons. Raccoons are nocturnal, and are generally afraid of people. All they want is food; they&#039;re scavengers. They&#039;re probably going through garbage cans or other trash, looking for tasty bits and scraps. For the most part, if you leave them alone, they will leave you alone. <br /><br />This being said, if you see a raccoon during the day, something is very wrong, and usually those guys turn out to be rabid. I would call animal control right away if I saw a raccoon running around in the daytime. They can also be very vicious when they have to be, so I would recommend people not letting their dogs approach them or run around outside, unsupervised (probably goes without saying, anyway). In a dog vs. raccoon fight, it&#039;d be a toss-up, even for a very fierce dog.<br /><br />It is very strange that they are here. I wonder where they may have come from. This is a very inhospitable place for them, for the most part, even though there&#039;s ample food for them here.

				Racoons are very smart. When we were vacationing last year at a resort, I was sitting by the pool and my daughter says &quot;Ma look theres a cat eating out of the garbage&quot;. Me -the animal lover that I am went right over there to feed/rescue it and it looked right at me did this weird noise and scared the crap out of me.. I screamed so loud all the security came out.&nbsp; We found out he lived under the dock with its family so before we left we dumped our food under there for him and he came out and got it. We named him Ricky!! I&#039;ll see if I can find some pictures of him eating a sandwhich.

				There are lots of raccoons around here.&nbsp; When I lived on both 76th Street and 77th Street, just south of Broadway, I saw these creatures a lot.&nbsp; Actually, I heard them fighting/mating more than I saw them.&nbsp; There are gangs of raccoons in the quiet spaces between many of the apartment buildings.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the proper word for a group of raccoons, but I think &quot;gang&quot; accurately describes their behavior.<br /><br />I also saw an opossum on my doorstep.&nbsp; At first, I thought it was a mutant rat!

Assemblyman Michael Miller, also of Queens, said that he stopped to make a call from his driveway the other day and a pair of raccoons ran under his car. <br /><br />Sherry Ortega, 42, who lives on 68th Avenue in Glendale, not far from Ms. Aiello, said raccoons so often drank from her pool she was too scared to let her sons swim at night. â€œTo the raccoons,â€ she said, â€œour pool is the local watering hole.â€<br /><br />Al Costello, 81, who lives nearby, said that a raccoon killed one of the stray cats Mr. Costello had fed for years. Another neighbor, Mary Borzelino, 73, said she no longer spent her evenings sitting on her stoop because of the raccoons.<br /><br />
