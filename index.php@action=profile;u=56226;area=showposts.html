					Actually doing some research at work right now and came across these relevant stats, from 2017 (most recent data, as per the NYU Furman Center). Elmhurst / Corona ranks #1 in the city for both foreign-born population (62.3%) as well as severe crowding (10.9% of all renter households). JH comes in 2nd for both of those categories, 57.5% and 10.5% respectively. Obviously, there&#039;s a correlation -- kind of reminds you of the old Lower East Side tenements 100 years ago.<br /><br />Anyway, didn&#039;t mean to get this thread so off track. Leaving was a matter of long-term practicality but I&#039;ll always look back very, very fondly at our time in Jackson Heights and plan on bringing the kids back someday to learn to love everything we loved about it.

					My wife and I just recently moved after 5 years in JH. Not a long time compared to most of you, I&#039;m sure, but we truly loved the neighborhood and deciding to leave was difficult. It was our first home together after getting engaged -- we were both coming back to New York from internships in South America and it was the diversity of the neighborhood that attracted us, like it attracts so many people. Why did we leave? Long term it just didn&#039;t seem sustainable, financially. Maybe as children of the suburbs we were infected early on with the expectations of owning, rather than renting, a home, which led us to look outside of not just JH but the entire City in general to find something we could afford. <br /><br />At least we&#039;re still in commuting distance and able to visit, which I think we&#039;ll do often. We spent Saturday doing all our old favorite walks (JH, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Astoria, Woodside) and met up with some neighbors --- found out our modest studio (which housed the two of us plus one cat, cozily) is now being rented to a young couple, two kids, a grandma, and a dog. I can&#039;t even imagine.

					I personally really like Genesis on Woodside Ave., though for some strange reason they also serve Thai/Chinese food (a few dishes, anyway). But their tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are great and I&#039;m pretty sure they deliver. I&#039;ve been meaning to check out Juquila as well, looks like a nice place.

					I worked seasonally at a B&amp;N on Long Island through high school and college -- wonderful people but I sure am glad I didn&#039;t take up management&#039;s offers of a management-track position...this was 5 years ago and even then the writing was on the walls, what with half the store taken up by toys, board games, headphones and other electronics, and now vinyl records, and less and less books. Oh well. <br /><br />Alibris.com is good for used books, especially out-of-print ones. Better than Amazon, anyway, though of course they don&#039;t offer a drone delivery option.

					Yes, Despana is great! The staff is friendly and always have great recommendations. Their Manhattan location is also worth a trip -- perfect place for a sandwich and glass of wine. Every time I&#039;ve gone there have been Spanish immigrants/tourists, palpably homesick as they scan the menu and display cases. If only the Queens location had a similar cafe area, then I&#039;d really never have to leave JH!

					Anyone else notice the bit of guerrilla artwork at the Manuel de Dios Unanue triangle near the 82nd st. station? (Photo attached). I love little urban interventions like that -- it critiques the park while at the same time improving it (the plywood it&#039;s painted on also acts as a sort of bench, protecting one&#039;s rear end from the metal spikes that I guess are meant to discourage loitering). <br /><br />The triangle was listed in NYCGo&#039;s JH tourism section as a &quot;green space&quot; to visit (<a href="http://www.nycgo.com/slideshows/must-see-jackson-heights-queens-nyc/10/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycgo.com/slideshows/must-see-jackson-heights-queens-nyc/10/</a>). I have to say, if I were from another neighborhood and decided to visit this &quot;park&quot; based on their recommendation, I&#039;d probably be a little disappointed (unless that Andean musical trio happened to be playing -- then it&#039;d be worth the trip, but only then). Anyone know who&#039;s responsible? JH&#039;s very own Banksy? My hats off!

					Wow, I&#039;m not in a co-op and didn&#039;t realize how political they could get. I figured there were rules for the shared courtyards, but getting fined for sitting on a swing? Anyway, I&#039;m glad to hear that the idea has been put forth before, even if it didn&#039;t get off the ground. Good to hear other people&#039;s perspectives on this!

					No, coming from the suburbs I was always able to plant out in the yard, so I&#039;ve never been a member of a community garden, though I&#039;ve visited plenty, notably out in East New York (lots of vacant lots converted to small gardens) and up in the Bronx, as well. I&#039;ve also spent a lot of time at the Brooklyn Grange in LIC and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, though that&#039;s a business of course, not a public garden -- still, a great place to visit if you&#039;re interested in rooftop gardening, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I&#039;m not an expert on how a typical community garden is run, but it seems as if most are administered by some umbrella organization like Grow NYC (or in the Bronx case, a neighborhood garden was overseen by the International Rescue Committee, as they ran agriculture programs for resettled refugees there). Although I&#039;m sure there are plenty that are run by local neighborhood organizations. <br /><br />I never meant to imply that JH was lacking in (private) green spaces -- believe me, I&#039;m grateful for the abundance of trees and the wonderful courtyards, even if I can only appreciate those from the sidewalk.

					Hey JH community, my wife and I are relative newcomers to Jackson Heights (Long Island transplants, been here for about a year and a half now, and loving it). I wonder, are there/have there ever been any plans for a community garden in the neighborhood? I&#039;ve seen plenty of posts here lamenting the lack of public green space, and I have to say that really is my one gripe (if Flushing Meadows weren&#039;t so close, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do). <br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine this isn&#039;t something that JHBG or the Green Alliance haven&#039;t considered before; a small neighborhood garden with plots given out in a yearly lottery system, somewhere to grow vegetables, use all that compost JHBG collects every week down on 69th St., meet other local green thumbs? Our north-facing windowsill didn&#039;t cut it last spring, and unfortunately there&#039;s no access to our building&#039;s courtyard (though I doubt we could plant there even with access). Ironic to live in America&#039;s first Garden City, and not have any access to a garden!<br /><br />Honestly, I have no idea where it could even go, but it would still be a nice asset. I&#039;ve seen old photos of whole blocks on Northern Blvd. converted to victory gardens back in the &#039;40s.... wouldn&#039;t that be nice?
