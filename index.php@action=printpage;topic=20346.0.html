				Took a walk through the neighborhood in New Year&#039;s Day--34th Avenue not too busy, then down to Diversity Plaza which gets dirtier and uglier--from the shanties that were set up by a few restaurants to having more trash receptacles than trees.&nbsp; Then approaching Roosevelt Avenue is a bird-poop laden sidewalk.&nbsp; Some of our community leaders hailed Diversity Plaza as a nice space for our neighborhood--and are now pushing for Open Streets on 34th Avenue.&nbsp; Would be great to have funds to keep Diversity Plaza clean--it is one of the main entries into our neighborhood.&nbsp; There are congested areas in Manhattan and elsewhere that can keep open spaces clean and welcoming. Any thoughts on how this area can be improved.

				I&#039;m sad to hear this. My last walk through there a few weeks ago, I was surprised how much cleaner it seemed since my commuting days. I guess I caught it on a good day. The pigeon mess under the subway station on the other side of Roosevelt!!! Seems like a health hazard. So disgusting. The trees will never survive the soil being as compacted as it is from so much foot traffic not staying on sidewalks/pathways.

				<em>&quot;The pigeon mess under the subway station on the other side of Roosevelt!!!

				The diversity plaza subway entrance area&nbsp; has be top 10 most vile subway experienceS in nyc.&nbsp; So many unwashed men, red spit, garbage, homeless everywhere.&nbsp; Has it been cleaned since March? <br /><br />A wonderful first impression of the neighborhood <br /><br />If we can raise 20k overnight for a community fridge. Letâ€™s focus our energy and get the subway station cleaned for the first time in a year.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello community politicians ...

				&nbsp; We tell people coming to JH to avoid the 74th st subway stop! It&#039;s been filthy for years and all the money that was spent raising the street to the curb? was a huge waste. If the community wants open space for gatherings, there are quiet streets across Roosevelt where EID prayers have been held, for example, that function much better than leaving Diversity Plaza as a open and unstructured space. It&#039;s got a population that is mostly men (90-95%) and lots of drinking and trash even though it&#039;s cleaned fairly often. The flowers are beautiful but don&#039;t seem the right match for this plaza and the level of traffic it receives. Feel sorry for people that live nearby really because it is a depressing place to walk through. <br /><br />&nbsp; <strong>Diversity Plaza is not working in it&#039;s current state</strong> and we should advocate for change here and by example, proceed slowly with 34th Ave, if the Open Streets continues, so we don&#039;t have issues there over time also. Look at some of the community projects in Manhattan, like on Broadway, that slowly change and upgrade but are a real asset to the area. Let&#039;s make it inviting please!<br />

				Diversity Plaza is a symptom of the neighborhood in general. If we want to change the condition of Diversity Plaza, we will also need to do something about Roosevelt Ave, and 82nd Street. This will involve not accepting, or rationalizing, most of the degenerative behavior that contributes to many of the problems in the neighborhood. We need to come together and constantly complain loudly about the gangs, drug dealers, prostitutes, overcrowding, spitting on the street, etc (and before anyone starts telling me to move back to Ohio, I was born here, in Jackson Heights and never left NYC). <br /><br />A good start would be to pressure, en masse, a clean sweep of Roosevelt starting with shutting down all of the bars on Roosevelt between 75th and Junction. We all know what these places are like. In short, if a bar or restaurant is attracting a clientele that requires security, it should be shut down.<br /><br />We also need to crack down on the groups of drunks who have started populating various street corners. They harass women, start fights, and are generally not contributing anything to the community.<br /><br />We can be in control. We just need to be willing to take action and pressure our elected officials who tend to be overly sympathetic to the people who are contributing to the poor quality of life in our corner of the world.

				Indeed, all of our elected officials should be continuously held accountable for issues that negatively affect our quality of life.&nbsp; This year presents us with the perfect opportunity to ask ALL of those running for City Council precisely what they will be willing to do to address the chronic problems - drugs, prostitution/sex trafficking, public intoxication, etc. - that have plagued Roosevelt Avenue for DECADES.&nbsp; The problems have been staring all of us in the face for years, and little seems to be done.

The neighborhood objected loudly. <br /><br />When we tried to get a Target store and affordable housing, we were called bigots for not favoring immigrant stores and slums. <br /><br />How can anything get done, improved, if the louder people in the neighborhood object to everything. <br /><br />Now we have the 34th avenue changes but ignore 37th avenue. Nothing is being done to improve the neighborhood along with the open streets changes, like building a large parking structure. (Of course, all of the available land is being used for new schools since we have more people living in the neighborhood than it was designed for.)&nbsp; <br /><br />

Calling 311 relentlessly, en masse, is useful. Eventually someone, somewhere will take notice and light a fire under someone&#039;s but to fix the problem. I don&#039;t want to give details, but the residents in my co-op were able to solve a problem that was happening on our block by doing just that after the 115th and our NCOs ignored our complaints for years. Needless to say, our block is much better as a result.

Of course in the case of horn honking, some people are just jerks. But if it is happening on a daily basis, and it is the same cars doing it all the time, there must be a larger reason than it just being being a bunch of goons who like to honk their horns in the same spot every day.<br /><br />The people around here who like to engage in illegal activities that are damaging to the community aren&#039;t exactly smart, but they are smart enough to know that they can get away with it because the community just says &quot;meh, that&#039;s the way it is&quot; but then complains with no action when things go south.&nbsp; <br /><br />
