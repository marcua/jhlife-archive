			not in your lifetime or mine. i just watched 30 minutes of politicians saying Jesus would advocate for sharing images advocating murder and laughing off violence against women because we really need to concentrate on keeping vaccines away from children. i had to stop when the congress&#039;s chief proponent of sexual abuse in youth sports started talking<br /><br />both sides. lol.

			The real problem is that side looks at the extreme leftist views with its anarchic agenda...with the same contempt.<br /><br />All extremists are exactly equal in their folly. With both sides playing the &quot;virtue&quot; card. <br /><br />Thankfully most folks aren&#039;t extremists. <br /><br />And that&#039;s why there is hope for the future!<br /><br />If a person concentrates on extremists and forgets that most people aren&#039;t...it probably leads to a lopsided view of the world. And an entrenched rigidity.

			there&#039;s nothing leftist about anarchism. nor is there anything right wing about it.<br /><br />anarchy is about the absence of rule. <br /><br />i recommend you actually pay attention to our current real-world politics and not spout the same tired &quot;hopey futurey&quot; stuff that suggests both sides really were doing good in Charlottesville.<br /><br />Remember which side wants to remind you that one religious/ethnic group in particular wants to replace &quot;real Americans.&quot;<br /><br />and embrace the tiki torchers as warmly as you wish.<br /><br /><br /><br />

			I was thinking more about this. Because it&#039;s important.<br /><br />By dehumanizing either side...it is easy to not see them as people exactly like we are.<br /><br />Education is the answer. <br /><br />By learning who the &quot;other&quot; is...the &quot;other&quot; becomes just like you.<br /><br />That&#039;s the beauty of being human. We learn and progress...slowly.<br /><br />If Ben Ferencz, the 101 year old prosecutor at the Nuremburg Trials can be optimistic about the progress of humankind...(and he is)...then I am inspired to follow him as an example.<br /><br />And not be led down the path of others who dwell in bitterness.<br /><br />
