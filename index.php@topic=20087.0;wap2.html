			I am interested in having solar panels installed on the flat roof on my house.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do any buildings or houses in JH have solar panels?&nbsp; If so what company did you use?

			Hey, yes. I&#039;m shocked more homes and buildings don&#039;t have solar panel considering how much sun jackson heights gets and considering we are on elevated terrain. <br /><br />On the right side of 76th street right before northern blvd there is a complex (four buildings actually) that have solar panels on their roof. You can try reaching out to the management about who they use for solar panel since they already have&nbsp; a working relationship with them.
