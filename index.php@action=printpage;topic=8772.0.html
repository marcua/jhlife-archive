				Roller hockey at the 78th Street Park (we never called it Travers) was great. A fine dust, probably from the wearing down of our wheels, formed a nice fine layer that helped the puck move smoothly.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have much equipment then, and helmets weren&#039;t invented yet but injuries were minimal. Lots of fun.

He was probably at least five years older. I used to talk to him when we were both younger when he played with his gasoline-engined model cars. Later, when he came back form his military service, we worked on motorcycles together. I hung with him and the other bikers at a hole-in-the-wall candy store on 37th Ave. between 78th and 79th street, upstairs above the Bowling alley. While Moe and Archies candy store on the corenr of 78th street had magazines and was a lot larger, the other one had a better selection of car, bike and gun mags, so I tended to hang there. <br /><br />One of my building neighbors, Johnny McLaughlin who ride a purple Triumph Bonnevile, was dating a girl I remembered from grade school, Annelise. She had been a shy, attractive girl and I was surprised to see her dating a &quot;bad boy&quot; biker. It was my first contact with the phenomenon.<br /><br />Those were great days.
