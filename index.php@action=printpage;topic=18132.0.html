				I just noticed this morning since I never walk up 75 Street how trash littered 75th Street is alongside Food Dynasty.&nbsp; Since it was 8AM, its possible the trash was removed later in the morning by store personnel.&nbsp; However, the entire concrete sidewalk is so filthy that it would take a powerful steam cleaner to clean it.&nbsp; This is quite a long stretch before you reach Montclair Gardens Cooperative.&nbsp; Has it always been like this?&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if the side of Foodtown on 76th Street is in a similar condition.&nbsp;

				Foodtown&#039;s frontage and side are quite clean, actually.

				I don&#039;t walk that way on 75th Street, but I have walked along 76th Street/Foodtown, which is ALWAYS littered with glass from the recycling/return machines.

It is what it is: collateral damage due to street recycling and the lure of 5 cents.

				I just passed by Trade Fair on 89th. There was a line at the recycling machines, but perhaps they only take plastic and not glass because the area wasn&#039;t near as fouled as Foodtown&#039;s.

				It’s usually pretty gross. Unfortunately, the Bruson Building side of the street isn’t doing much better. The only thing it has going for it is that there’s no supermarket on that side.

(I don&#039;t look that closely.) It usually seems pretty dirty there—but no broken glass like on 76th. I avoid walking by Foodtown on 76th no matter what shoes I&#039;m wearing.
