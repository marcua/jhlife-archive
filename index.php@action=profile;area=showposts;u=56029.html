					I don&#039;t understand the criticism. First it was - she&#039;s an unqualified bartender. Then it was - she&#039;s a fake because she graduated college and was taped dancing with her fellow students. Then it was - how could she afford a business suit to wear on the House floor, or to rent a place in DC. Now she&#039;s a traitor because she attended the Met Gala?<br /><br />Who cares. I would have gone in a second to that Gala. And the very fact that Ana Wintour invited her speaks to her relevance, exposure and standing - all good things if we want anything done in the community. Stop beating on a young woman just because she dresses nice. It&#039;s silly.

					Hi all<br /><br />My husband and I are going through surrogacy and we&#039;re expecting a baby on (or about) November 15th. We&#039;re prepping like crazy, and we&#039;re also doing some renovations, but we&#039;d like to see if anyone has any recommendations for a Queens based pediatrician. If you can let us know, I&#039;d appreciate any help.

					[Will the corona virus die out as the weather warms?&nbsp; I&#039;ve read several articles that says its possible.&nbsp; The articles that I read did mention that countries with very warm and humid climates don&#039;t have the problem.]<br /><br />That&#039;s not how it works.&nbsp; Many poor countries simply have not tested, so no one knows the spread.&nbsp; Having said that, there are cases in every continent, except Antartica, so summer is clearly not killing it.&nbsp; New Zealand and Australia have cases, and it&#039;s summer there.<br /><br />

					Since there&#039;ve been many posts, here are my impressions:<br /><br />I live on 82nd Street between 35th and 37th Avenues.&nbsp; Our place is in the back, so we literally hear no noise whatsoever, despite being on a bus route.&nbsp; 37th Avenue, and 82nd Street, as well as the area around 74th, tends to get messy during the day, but go beyond those blocks and it&#039;s clean.&nbsp; I actually prefer living on 82nd because in the morning, I stand on the subway for one stop, and then many people exit at 74th, so I almost always get a seat.&nbsp; Been here over 15 years, and I can count on one hand the times that I didn&#039;t get a seat.&nbsp; <br /><br />We moved here when we were in out 30&#039;s.&nbsp; We&#039;re a gay couple, but not much into nightlife, so this suited us.&nbsp; When we were in our 20&#039;s we lived in the East Village.&nbsp; If you go out at night, and still want to stay in Queens, try Sunnyside as the nightlife is better there.<br /><br />As for safety, as a guy, I&#039;ve never been scared.&nbsp; Having said that, I also never go on Roosevelt after, say, 11 p.m.&nbsp; And the residential streets can get spookily quiet at night, so if I was a woman, and someone was following me on them, I&#039;d have my guard up.&nbsp; When I find myself in that situation, I just sing along to the music on my headphones just to make myself known so the woman won&#039;t think I&#039;m sneaking up on them.&nbsp; Most of the times, I get a chuckle as I pass, but better than scaring the crap out of someone.

					[Sigh. No he didn&#039;t. He caucused with the IDC. It&#039;s been almost three years since he joined the IDC and people in this district still don&#039;t understand how the IDC&#039;s power sharing arrangement with the Senate Republicans work.]<br /><br />Yes, I am aware of the IDC.&nbsp; The IDC kept the Republicans in power and in control of the Senate by caucusing with them, thus giving them the solid majority.&nbsp; So my statement still stands - he caucused with the Republicans, but via the IDC.<br /><br />Peralta&#039;s reasoning was that by giving them power, the neighborhood would be rewarded.&nbsp; That sounded great, but Peralta&#039;s signature legislation (the speed cameras in school zones) wasn&#039;t passed by the Republicans.&nbsp; In fact, they sat on the renewal bill for the cameras that already existed and permitted it to expire.&nbsp; Cuomo issued an executive order to keep them running, and the Democrats passed a permanent, and expanded bill that Peralta wanted, and increased camera presence to all schools in his memory.&nbsp; And while the neighborhood did get money for schools, there was no evidence ever provided that these funds were something that we got because of his IDC membership, or something we would have gotten anyway.

					I think the law is great.&nbsp; The reality:&nbsp; you need a license to drive, and you need to stay out of trouble if you are undocumented to stay in this country.&nbsp; While this reality does not create much of a clash in NYC given our transit system, it absolutely does in the rest of NYS.&nbsp; Pulled over for a broken tail light?&nbsp; Then you get arrested for driving without a license and there&#039;s a fine and/or prison time as a result of the offense.&nbsp; If you get prison time, then you are on ICE&#039;s must go list.<br /><br />Why do we have to criminalize everything?&nbsp; Why not give licenses to everyone, require that they carry insurance, and remove one area of concern.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good for NYS.

					Question -- is he also going to introduce a law that compels bike riders to actually USE the bike lane where one if made available?&nbsp; Because one of the issues I&#039;ve faced is having to drive down a newly narrow road with a bike lane, and bike riders are both to my right (properly in the lane) and to my left, so there&#039;s no room for a car to actually drive.&nbsp; Also, does this bill increase police enforcement to prevent people from double-parking, which would necessarily mean that any driver that wants to move forward has to use the bike lane to go around the car?&nbsp; &nbsp;

					No, No and No.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who has been to a dispensary in any other state and country knows that the proprietors and sales people are there not only to sell you things, but to prevent you from buying something that you likely will not want.&nbsp; There are different types of pot, and different impacts that the pot will have.&nbsp; There&#039;s the typical &quot;stoner&quot; pot where you&#039;ll eat a bunch of Doritos and pass out while watching The Big Lebowski, and there&#039;s other part that will enhance your mood, and won&#039;t put to you sleep.&nbsp; Those come mixed, and with varying strength.&nbsp; You need someone to explain these differences and point you in the right direction.&nbsp; And then, of course, there&#039;s edibles.&nbsp; You can&#039;t have the bodega guy sell a pack of gummies to someone without explaining that you can&#039;t eat the entire bag;&nbsp; without letting you what you should expect to feel after eating, and without explaining the various dosages.<br /><br />Pot may be harmless, but it&#039;s not like cigarettes.&nbsp; A pack of Marlboro and a pack of Lucky will do roughly the same thing.&nbsp; Not so with a strong Indica or Sativa.&nbsp; The bodega guy is not qualified to sell these.&nbsp; They have to sold by licensed stores with employees that know their stuff.
