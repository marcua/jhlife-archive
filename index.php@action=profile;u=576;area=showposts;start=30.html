					Right-on analysis, Cupcake.&nbsp; Instead of implying that I was lying, why didn&#039;t Sears just address the issue?&nbsp; I obviously touched a nerve.<br /><br />As for other parts of the district, Queenskid, you are right that it will be a challenge for Dromm.&nbsp; However, I think Dromm can do the work to overcome any perceived obstacles.&nbsp; Knowledge is power, and I think Dromm&#039;s success depends on his ability to inform and connect with voters outside Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like Sears is any more responsive to Lefrak than to Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Dromm is completely serious about representing the 25th District.&nbsp; Compare his performance--substance, tone, energy--with the other candidates&#039; at the last two events.&nbsp; What you see Sears, Quiroz, and the County organization doing is a dance.&nbsp; Like all good dancers, they get so into what they are doing that they forget about the rest of the world, in this case, the residents of the community.&nbsp; There are many other perceptive posters who have caught on, so review previous posts if you want to see what I mean.<br />

					Only Helen Sears, one other Democrat, and the Republicans on City Council voted against the lead paint bill.&nbsp; Among the Democrats, the bill had near unanimous support.<br /><br />As for what Council Member Sears has done for individual constituents, I cannot say.&nbsp; Since I have been living in the community, I have had great difficulty getting any response from her.&nbsp; I have heard the same from many other neighbors.&nbsp;

					I was the individual at the JFK candidates&#039; night who asked Council Member Sears why she never responds to constituents like me.&nbsp; I have called, written, and visited her office on several issues, but only received one response and that was with indirect pressure from Speaker Christine Quinn.&nbsp; (Every other elected official who represents me at the very least responds in a professional manner; I&#039;m not sure why Council Member Sears cannot.) <br /><br />I guess my reasonable question made her feel &quot;threatened&quot; and &quot;intimidated,&quot; to use her own words when describing the phone calls that her office received during the term limits debacle.&nbsp; <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/committee-takes-up-term-limits-bill/?pagemode=print" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/committee-takes-up-term-limits-bill/?pagemode=print</a><br /><br />Council Member Sears definitely took a posture like someone who felt threatened.&nbsp; Her response was full of anger and never came close to answering my question.&nbsp; She certainly did not act like she wants her constituents to vote for her.

You talk about $2 Dance clubs and&nbsp; &quot;bars reminiscent of the home country that never seem to refuse even the drunkest patron&quot; so it&#039;s clear you&#039;re identifying one specific group. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s wise to pick one group and blame them for a neighborhood&#039;s problems based solely on their immigration status and country or region of origin.&nbsp; When we say that this group of people does &quot;X&quot; solely because they are immigrants, it runs dangerously close to generalization and I don&#039;t see how it can be an accurate point of view.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think my whole issue with the &quot;immigrants commit crimes when the economy goes sour&quot; theory is the fact that it plays into a xenophobic point of view. I am not calling anyone xenophobic, merely saying it&#039;s the beginning of a slippery slope that solves nothing. Instead of looking at people based solely on their country of origin why can&#039;t we look at another common thread ? Why not look at issues related to crime on an economic level. If it is true that immigrants are among the poorest in our society and are more apt to commit crimes when there are no other options, then they are doing it because of their financial status not their immigration status. Taking nationality out of the picture for a moment makes it easier to deal with the real issue. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are two different things going on.<br /><br />First, I have a problem with the way Aronan makes his argument, which, to put it mildly, is not very constructive.&nbsp; He distorts what I am saying to try and take the &quot;more liberal than thou&quot; approach.&nbsp; For example, Aronan used the word &quot;solely&quot; four times(!) in order to create an oversimplified black-and-white dichotomy.&nbsp; After heightening the stakes in such a way, he is then able to position himself as the good guy and me as the bad guy.&nbsp; I never proposed an overarching &quot;immigrants go awry when the economy goes awry&quot; theory.&nbsp; I never &quot;singled out a specific group of people&quot; for &quot;scapegoating&quot; (a term used by Aronan in a previous post) and am deeply offended by any such suggestion.<br /><br />Then, Aronan cries, &quot;Slippery slope!&quot; to shut off any future discussion of this issue, which deserves thoughtful analysis that considers all the complexities without resorting to rhetorical games.&nbsp; Yes, they are both dealing with the lack of adequate resources, but poor undocumented immigrants deal with different issues than poor families that have been in this country for generations.&nbsp; To pretend they deal with the same issues in order to justify the sly insertion of the word &quot;xenophobia&quot; into the debate is irresponsible.<br /><br />Second, Aronan might have proposed some good starting points for moving forward, but they got lost in his style of writing.

However, one doesn&#039;t poop where one eats.<br /><br />But it still doesn&#039;t make sense that a down turn in the economy forces those who are most affected by it in to a life of crime. Indeed immigrants, particularly the undocumented actually have more to lose than a US citizen. Prosecution and imprisonment are a deterrent enough but for undocumented individuals there is the threat of deportation and a ban on re-entry.&nbsp; For this reason many undocumented immigrants keep a very low profile, even when times are good. Why would they suddenly &quot;blow their cover&quot; for a few hundred dollars ?&nbsp; &nbsp;It would seem that a down turn in the economy in the U.S. would probably force the undocumented population here to go elsewhere for work (ie: Canada) or voluntarily return home, a process I believe which is called reverse immigration. <br /><br />In times of economic trouble immigrants often become the scape goat for a society that needs something to blame other than its self for its problems.&nbsp; We all tend to focus on the negative a lot more than the positive and talk more about crime and community problems than we do about safety and successes.<br /><br />A methodic and scientific approach to identifying crimes that are committed and why seems to be a much better way to address the crime issue here in JH or anywhere for that matter. Couple that with increased police presence and some version of a neighborhood watch program and I would think our crime rate would go down. It would be an interesting social experiment to see if closing all the $2 dance clubs has any significant impact on the crime rate. I bet you $2 it wouldn&#039;t, at best I&#039;d venture to guess we&#039;d see a spike in other crimes like prostitution. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with elyaqim and don&#039;t agree with lumping together all crime, just as I don&#039;t agree with lumping together all immigrants.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about Aronan&#039;s theory because domestic violence, with its own set of factors, is the ultimate &quot;poop where you eat crime.&quot;<br /><br />No one said the economy is forcing anyone into a &quot;life of crime.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s really not fair to take a point made by the other side and use hyperbole to distort it.&nbsp; (Let&#039;s keep the discussion civil and not resort to histrionics. <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /> )&nbsp; As for Aronan&#039;s view into the mind of the undocumented immigrant who commits (or might be tempted to commit) a crime, I am not sure I see how he reaches his conclusions.&nbsp; Obviously, no one is talking about the immigrants who leave but only about the immigrants who stay so I was confused about that point.<br /><br />Immigrants ARE part of the society, from economic and cultural development to, yes, crime.&nbsp; The scapegoating image is, again, a bit over the top.&nbsp; At least in Jackson Heights, I detect--among immigrants and non-immigrants--a generally favorable view of immigrants and the contributions they make.<br /><br />Aronan&#039;s final paragraph starts out on a good note.&nbsp; I am expecting constructive solutions but, instead, it devolves into smarminess, e.g., &quot;I bet you $2 [closing the $2 dance clubs] wouldn&#039;t&quot; impact the crime rate.&nbsp; I do think reducing the climate of lawlessness would help, through immigration reform, cleaning up establishments that exploit people, and so on.&nbsp; Also, proactive efforts, such as those mentioned, are worth looking into.

Yes more people with less work means more time to get in to trouble. But, as it was mentioned here before most rational human beings would realize that risking imprisonment for $300 from a grocery store checkout counter doesn&#039;t balance. The person who held up Trade Fair didn&#039;t do it because he lost his job, he did it because that IS his job. Good or bad economy he would have committed that crime anyway.<br /><br />The harassment and beatings on 37th Ave. can also not be blamed on the economy. If we follow the theory that these crimes happen when the bars close then these are people who had money to be out drinking in the first place. I would assume their objective isn&#039;t robbery as much as it is settling a bar fight or some other &quot;beef&quot;. This would also include gang related violence.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are complex reasons why people commit crimes.&nbsp; I do think the economy definitely plays a role in crime in Jackson Heights, where so many immigrants--with and without papers--live, work, and play.&nbsp; (I am NOT saying immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate.&nbsp; Jackson Heights entertains a large number of immigrants so it follows that a large number of crimes are committed by immigrants.)&nbsp; Immigrants, especially undocumented ones, are often the ones who feel an economic downturn more acutely.&nbsp; Many of these individuals face tremendous pressure--even in &quot;normal&quot; times--in the US and from their home countries and are surrounded by opportunities for mischief.&nbsp; Look at all the criminal enterprises that are aimed at undocumented young men here in JH: fake id operations that are everywhere if you know what you&#039;re looking for, graphic sex worker cards passed out along Roosevelt Ave, $2-a-dance clubs where the female dancers are mistreated, bars reminiscent of the home country that never seem to refuse even the drunkest patron--yes, even very poor people turn to alcohol--and the list goes on.<br /><br /><br />The &quot;bar spillout&quot; crimes that seemed visible to me the other night might very well be connected to the economy.

					I was walking along 37th Ave., westbound from 84th Street, with three friends at about 4 am today (Sunday, February 22).&nbsp; A group of men standing outside a bodega started making vile and, of course, homophobic comments in Spanish.&nbsp; After passing them, I turned to one friend and made a comment about safety issues in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Just then, we saw another group beating a person at 82nd Street and 37th Avenue.&nbsp; My friend called the police, who responded immediately.&nbsp; By that time, the group was chasing the victim down 81st Street.&nbsp; I waved down the responding car, and we quickly offered our limited description.&nbsp; After the car continued on, we walked further and encountered what looked to me, at a distance, like a rowdy group at 79th Street.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t want to take any chances at that point so we turned down 79th toward Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />I usually don&#039;t walk down 37th Ave. at 4 am.&nbsp; Is it like that every weekend after the bars close?<br /><br />Is there someone who has perspective on the crime rate in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; Has it gone up in recent months, or does it just seem like it&#039;s gone up?<br /><br />Finally, is there anything to do to ensure this type of situation is minimized?&nbsp; It is very disconcerting, to say the least.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />
