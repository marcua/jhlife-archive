			This might be a bit of a touchy subject for some, and being in that era, perhaps it is something shared with other neighborhoods, but there is an unusual number of my friends from J.H. that have passed away, way too young.&nbsp; I miss them dearly. Those years were the most formidable of my life, and that is why, my childhood friends hold a special place in my heart. Rest in Peace brothers and sisters. You are always remembered in my thoughts and prayers.

			I grew up there in the 70s as well...we moved there in 1976 and I moved to NJ in 2005.&nbsp; You are correct, I can count almost on 2 hands those of my friends who have passed.&nbsp; I&#039;m only 43.&nbsp; I miss one of them dearly.
