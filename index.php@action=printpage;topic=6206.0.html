				This summer, PianoVerse will be having two summer programs that encourage children to explore their creativity through music and art. <br /><br />Our <strong>July Piano Explorations</strong> program will take place from July 12-29, and include AM and PM sessions. <br />July Piano Explorations is designed for beginner pianists who wish to propel their music and piano skill forward through diverse study of piano and be a part of something musical, creative, fun and productive this summer. These classes will take place from Tuesdays through Fridays, for 3 weeks. <br /><br />You can view more information about the July program here: http://www.pianoverse.com/july-about.html<br /><br />Our <strong>August Music &amp; Art Program</strong> will run from August 1-12 (Session I) and August 15-26 (Session II), with classes offered at 9:30AM-12:30PM and 1PM-4PM <br />Join PianoVerse in a specialized program that fuses music and art. Students will have the opportunity to explore their creativity and create original pieces like painting sound images, building instruments, learning how to write original songs and more. Classes take place Monday through Friday, for 2 weeks.<br /><br />You can view more information about the August program here: http://www.pianoverse.com/august-about.html<br /><br /><strong>Why music &amp; art programs?</strong><br />The arts inspire new thinking and ideas. The power of creativity and the arts can be seen everywhereâ€” in the music we listen to, the buildings we live or work, the clothes we wear, the technologies we use, the websites we browseâ€¦you get the point. Despite creativityâ€™s pervasiveness and value in cultures and societies far and wide, creative opportunities that offer quality programming are dwindling as cuts on the arts continue to increase.<br /><br /><strong>Brighten up Jackson Heights with more arts opportunities! </strong>Well, thatâ€™s what we aim to do anyway. Donâ€™t let our name fool you into thinking weâ€™re only a piano center (although we do &lt;3 pianos). The arts hold a special place in our hearts and we want to open up that special place and explore the possibilities with you. Finding and developing our creative strengths is a vital part of becoming who we are, and we hope to help youngsters along the way.<br /><br />If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here :)
