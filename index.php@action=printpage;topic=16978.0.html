				Dear neighbors,<br /><br />Thank you all so so much for postings and commenting on this post. I must admit that I have not been recently login to this website, I apolgized. I have read all of the&nbsp; post here and response. You guys are awesome,&nbsp; seeing you all talked about Addictive and caring about us meant everything to us. Especially me (Patrick). Francisco does not do social media much, so he is missing out.&nbsp; :) Just kidding, I always update him. I will great a new post about Addictive Beer and Cheese and Vietnamese sandwiches. So excited that everyone that had tried our Vietnamese sandwiches are loving it! Only complaint was not too spicy enough. I upped our game, it is now spicy spicy! I hope you can stop by soon to order a sandwich. Doors open at noon today. <br /><br />Thank you so much!! <br />Patrick <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16430.msg80969.html#msg80969">Quote from: jackinjh on September 05, 2017, 04:34:42 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Does anyone know the opening hour for both, the beer place and the new tapas place.<br /><br />I attempted few times in the past month for brunch, but both time the new tapas place are closed.

				Dear neighbors, <br /><br />First of all, I would like to apologize for not posting here as often as I should have. For that, I am sorry. This is a great platform to share with our fellow neighbors about what&#039;s news in the neighborhood and etc...<br />Thank you Ed and everyone who posted and post pictures of Addictive pictures here. I got emotional this morning when I saw all the posts and replied from one another, you guys are just awesome! I might not have know who you are individually, but many of you know my name and Francisco name, so I am sure you know us well. <br /><br />I am so excited to let you know we finally have a set&nbsp; schedules for Addictive Beer and Cheese and Vietnamese sandwiches. <br /><br />Monday: Closed<br />Tuesday: Noon to 9:00 pm<br />Wednesday: Noon to 9:00 pm<br />Thursday: Noon to 9:00 pm<br />Friday: Noon to 9:00 pm<br />Saturday: 11:00 am to 9:00 pm<br />Sunday: 11:00 am to 8:00 pm<br /><br />Many of our customers wanted us to open early so they can grab a vietnamese sandwich for lunch or early dinner. After much consideration,&nbsp; Francisco and I have decided on this schedules. Also, we have customers want to order Vietnamese sandwiches to go, but as of now, we do not offer take out. I need your opinion on this please, should we do take out for Vietnamese sandwiches? I would love to hear from you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you and I hope to see yuh guys soon at any of our shops. <br /><br />Addictive Boutique Winery <br />Addictive Wine and Tapas<br />Addictive Beer and Cheese and Vietnamese Sandwiches <br /><br />All on 87th street and Northern Blvd. I call it hash tag #Addictive87.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Love you guys!<br />Patrick and Francisco <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Yes, please do banh mi take out!* I would be a frequent customer. Such a great to-go food and such a tasty and easy dinner.<br /><br />Thank you so much for all you do and have done to help make our neighborhood awesome. Love all of #Addictive87 :).<br /><br />*Just edited to add: If you do add take out, please try to use recyclable or compostable packaging if you can. (For sandwiches, a foil wrapper and a paper bag is usually all you need.) It drives me crazy when takeout comes in styrofoam.

				Nice little article. <br /><br />I imagine banh mi need no introduction for many of us, especially with JoJu so close by (http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/joju/).<br /><br />Also curious what&#039;s Vietnamese about your Vietnamese tuna (from an earlier one of your posts): Is it that the tuna is from Vietnam, or is it about the herbs and spices added to the tuna salad?

				Hi there Dodger,<br /><br />So glad you have heard of banh mi! I am sure you must have had it at JoJu as well. I hope you can come try ours as well. <br /><br />The Vietnamese Tuna sandwich is American tuna marinated with house made sauces and add along carrot and daikon pickles. It comes with a puffy croissant. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Patrick <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17067.msg81752.html#msg81752">Quote from: Dodger on October 05, 2017, 04:51:55 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nice little article. <br /><br />I imagine banh mi need no introduction for many of us, especially with JoJu so close by (http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/joju/).<br /><br />Also curious what&#039;s Vietnamese about your Vietnamese tuna (from an earlier one of your posts): Is it that the tuna is from Vietnam, or is it about the herbs and spices added to the tuna salad?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I leave that up to the moderators to control/consolidate. I still don&#039;t think this would properly be called &quot;spam&quot;. And I hardly think it has been hard to find other topics because this business has been dominating the board. Kind of an exaggeration, I think.

				Ed--? Snarky remark in response to my comment meaning exactly what? I just offered an opinion that the posts by Addictive are not &quot;spam,&quot; but merely their attempt to communicate with people who are posting here because they are patrons of the business. I think there is a big difference between that and spam. But thanks for your insight.
