				Emergency Rally for Muslim and Immigrant Rights<br /><br />The moment we&#039;ve been bracing for is here. Multiple news outlets are reporting that President Trump will sign an executive order today or tomorrow, restricting entry to the US from majority Muslim countries. Another executive order is also expected, attacking our undocumented neighbors with an expanded border wall and an intent to target sanctuary cities like NYC. As a city of immigrants, we cannot stay silent in the face of such hate. We ask you to gather tonight (Wednesday), to show President Trump that all New Yorkers stand with our Muslim and Latino neighbors. Together, we will form a beacon of light against the coming darkness<br /><br />WHAT: CAIR-NY Holds Rally for Muslim and Immigrant Rights.<br />WHEN: Wednesday, January 25, 5 p.m.<br />WHERE: Washington Square Park Arch in West Village/Manhattan<br /><br />See more info here: https://www.facebook.com/events/1822485898020815/

				lalochezia, I whole heartedly agree with you.

				NEW YORK (January 25th, 2016) — Tonight, at 7pm, immigrant New Yorkers with Make the Road New York will march in Jackson Heights in response to Donald Trump’s executive actions to attack immigrant families and communities. Immigrant New Yorkers are outraged by these actions to tear families apart, which will include building a wall on the Southern border, seeking to dramatically increase immigration enforcement, and defunding sanctuary cities. They will march through New York’s most diverse community to highlight their strength and resilience.<br /><br />WHAT: Immigrant New Yorkers march in Jackson Heights to say: We are #HereToStay <br /><br />WHEN: Wednesday, January 25, 7pm <br /><br />WHO: Make the Road New York <br /><br />WHERE: Corner of 92nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, Jackson Heights, Queens [By train: 7 to 90th St - Elmhurst] <br /><br />Community members and advocates shared the following statements in advance of the march:<br /><br />Zuleima Dominguez, Youth Power Project member at Make the Road New York and DACA recipient, said: “This is a dark day for me, my family, and my community. As a DREAMer and member of a mixed-status immigrant family, I know what it’s like to live in the shadows—with the fear of being taken away from the people I love. Trump wants us to feel more of that fear and put our future and our dreams in jeopardy. Still, sad as I am today, I also know that my community is strong. We are here to stay, and we are going to resist. We will not go back to the shadows. We will not allow Trump’s racism and xenophobia to devastate our communities. We will stand up together to defend ourselves.”<br /><br />Javier H. Valdés, Co-Executive Director of Make the Road New York, said: “This is an act of war against the immigrant community. Increasing ICE and border enforcement and aiming to defund sanctuary cities is an attack on our families. And we stand united with refugees and our Muslim brothers and sisters; an attack on any one of us is an attack on us all. With this executive action, Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to terrorize us and make millions of immigrants live in fear. But we are committed to not letting that happen. Today we join allies around the country in committing to the fiercest possible resistance to stop the President’s reckless attacks. We will organize in our communities, and we will explore every possible legal avenue to challenge this vile policy.”

				Actually, when the targets are people who aren&#039;t white, it&#039;s completely racist. It&#039;s just scapegoating non-whites to scare white people by preying upon their racial biases.

				The targets are specific muslim-dominant countries, not brown people.&nbsp; A white person from that country would face the same restrictions as his brown neighbor.&nbsp; It&#039;s not racist by design, it just situationally happens to target a majority non-white population.<br /><br />Trump is not the one who&#039;s been scaring white people, you can blame that on the sensationalist media in this country who make millions and millions by framing news reports in a way that will generate more ad revenue for them.&nbsp; Scared people watch/read/click the news.&nbsp; Trump is simply taking advantage of that existing situation.

				That&#039;s a bit extreme CaptainFlannel, don&#039;t you think?&nbsp; This policy is not about rounding up American muslims and putting them in internment camps.&nbsp; This is about temporarily restricting immigration from specific countries.&nbsp; Something, by the way, that we already do.&nbsp; And there are some heavily muslim-dominant countries on that map that aren&#039;t part of this policy at all.

				We can confirm that FDR enacted a racist policy - the internment of Japanese Americans. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if FDR was a racist. Do you think a white man born in 1880&#039;s held explicit racial biases? I think the chances are quite good. Do I think he held some pretty significant implicit biases? Absolutely. Do I think a white man born in the 1940s has implicit racial biases? No doubt he does. We all do. He preyed upon those racial biases to run a racist campaign.<br />https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) <br /><br />Candidate Trump called for a database of Muslims in the country. Even if you&#039;re being generous and think he didn&#039;t fully hear the MSNBC reporter&#039;s question, Fox News&nbsp; asked him &quot;<strong>would President Donald Trump support a full Muslim database?</strong>&quot; His response was :&quot;Basically the suggestion was made and <strong>(it’s) certainly something we should start thinking about.</strong>&quot;<br /><br />These are the candidates words. The media did not make this up. <br /><br />http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/24/donald-trumps-comments-database-american-muslims/ (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/24/donald-trumps-comments-database-american-muslims/)

				Hey Capt,<br /><br />I stand against him and much of what he stands for. I was a Bernie supporter long before the corruption of the DNC boxed him out. So while I take pride to live in a very diverse community the simple fact is the American people were lied to by both the GOP and the DNC in 1986 when the illegal issue was 3mm deep. We trusted their word and the issue literally grew by a factor of 3 or 6 (depending on what #&#039;s your think are accurate) with 25-30 years. So why on earth would any clear minded citizen trust so called Comprehensive reform when it already failed once.<br /><br />You seem educated so remind me of what Einstein said about insanity? <br /><br />My take, is much like one unarmed person being shot by the cops is one too many so is a citizen dying by someone who never should have been able to enter the country, whether they came from Canada or Cambodia.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dems want votes- Gop wants cheap labor and the rest of us are pitted against each other.<br /><br /><br />As a sovereign nation we had an absolute right to define our own policies. <br /><br /><br />To me a fence (hoping they using more technology than bricks) is nothing more than a national dead bolt on the door.<br /><br /><br />all the best to you<br /><br /><br />
