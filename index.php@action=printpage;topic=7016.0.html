				We are postponing Sunday&#039;s &quot;South Asia Store Crawl&quot; at the 37th Road pedestrian plaza. A plaza opponent suddenly called a protest against the plaza for the same time as our previously schedule event. <br /><br />After discussions we decided to postpone our event for at least one week. While our event was to demonstrate to merchants that the pedestrian plaza could be good for business, there&#039;s no point in risking a confrontation, as slim as that chance seems. <br /><br />There is opposition to some of the traffic changes made by the city in that area, but not all the criticized changes are directly related to the pedestrian plaza.<br />For instance:<br />*The bus stop was moved off 37th Road - a major complaint of some merchants - to speed bus service. That&#039;s been accomplished, according to Councilman Dromm&#039;s office. <br />*The elimination of several left turns near Roosevelt and Broadway was designed to make a dangerous intersection safer. And that&#039;s also been accomplished, Dromm&#039;s office said.<br /><br />It&#039;s not clear how much business is off. We saw no empty storefronts along 37th Road today (except for the long-shuttered Eagle Theater). Also, the Councilman&#039;s office says it&#039;s been rebuffed in its request for merchants to open their books to document the losses. In any case, not all business problems can be tied to traffic changes.These are tough economic times and many storefronts have become empty along 37th Avenue and 82nd Streets in the last few months. Also, plaza supporters (including a large restaurant on that street) believe a landscaped permanent plaza will eventually boost business in the area. <br /><br />Finally feel free to dine and shop along 37th Road (and 73rd and 74th Streets, too) on your own and let merchants know that you think a permanent plaza will help business. <br /><br />Len Maniace<br /><br />
