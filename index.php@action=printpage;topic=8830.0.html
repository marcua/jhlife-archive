				My family has been in a bit of a restaurant rut, eating too often from old favorites (Pio Pio, Nanking, Delhi Heights, Arunee, Thai Son, etc.).&nbsp; We realized we needed a bit of a change, so we&#039;ve been trying to mix it up a bit more.&nbsp; In the process, we&#039;ve had some wonderful meals at new places and old ones that we used to enjoy but haven&#039;t tried in a long while.<br /><br /><br />We&#039;ve particularly enjoyed:<br />Phayul (37-65 74th St) - Himalayan/Tibetan<br />Taste of Lahore (73-10 Northern Blvd.) - Pakistani<br />Dosa Delight (35-66 73rd St) - South Indian Vegetarian<br />Himalayan Yak (72-20 Roosevelt Ave) - Himalayan/Tibetan<br /><br />The food at all four was excellent.<br /><br />The first three are not particularly about service and atmosphere.&nbsp; That didn&#039;t bother me, but they&#039;re not necessarily places to take your guests from out of town.<br /><br />Himalayan Yak, on the other hand, had a very festive atmosphere.&nbsp; On a Saturday night, it was packed, with several groups (6-8) apparently visiting from outside the neighborhood.&nbsp; There was some fantastic live jazz (2 guitars + drum), which I was told is there every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night.<br /><br />Has anybody else found any overlooked gems recently?

				Thanks for the info on Himalayan Yak. I will definitely check that out. My own favorites are Zabb Elee which I think is the best Thai food in the area, and El Sol on Northern Blvd. for ceviche. If you&#039;re willing to travel a bit further into Elmhurst, Sweet Yummy has very good Sichuan food(they also deliver to Jackson Heights).

				todd, have you tried Ayada (thai) yet?&nbsp; It&#039;s so great.&nbsp; They deliver to most of JH I think (I&#039;m on 73rd) and it&#039;s a nice space to eat at as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m interested to see that you eat at Nanking a lot.&nbsp; You don&#039;t think it&#039;s become almost inedible?&nbsp; The last three times I ordered were not just mediocre, the food was horrendous.&nbsp; I gave up on them about 8 months ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tried Uncle Peter&#039;s for the first time recently and thought it was just ok - the dessert was especially disappointing - not very good, tiny and ridiculously overpriced at $7.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I ordered from Uncle Peter&#039;s once via seamless - NEVER AGAIN.&nbsp; Our address is clearly marked on the building however I had to fight with the delivery guy on the phone and the manager of the restaurant on the phone last winter for almost an hour to communicate to the delivery guy that he was calling me from THE WRONG BUILDING.&nbsp; I said - just GO OUTSIDE, you&#039;re obviously not in the right place if you think you&#039;re standing outside my apartment door and I confirm that you are NOT... LOL&nbsp; &nbsp; (Seriously he refused and the manager told me I must be mistaken!!!)<br /><br />Sure enough, he came out from a building across the street, with a completely DISsimilar number. haha.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh and the food was &quot;ok&quot; and happily they refunded due to the inconvenience.<br /><br />We LOVE Ayada Thai &amp; UFC.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8830.msg50398.html#msg50398">Quote from: Lilybell on September 11, 2013, 02:38:41 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I tried Uncle Peter&#039;s for the first time recently and thought it was just ok - the dessert was especially disappointing - not very good, tiny and ridiculously overpriced at $7. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Usually have good food experiences from Uncle Peters.&nbsp; Last time I went I ordered the seafood pasta.&nbsp; The mussels and clams had a ton of sand in them.&nbsp; From what my friends in the kitchen tell me this is a restaurant cardinal sin not to properly wash seafood.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been back in 15 months since that experience.&nbsp; <br /><br />Paul

				I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again.&nbsp; I REALLY miss Himalayan Hut&#039;s quality (from when they had just opened).&nbsp; Is there any Indian Chinese that is consistently good around here?&nbsp; *sniff sniff*

				Uncle Peter&#039;s is really overpriced and everytime I&#039;ve ordered there it&#039;s taken at least an hour for delivery.<br /><br />I use seamless *a lot*, these are some of my go tos:<br /><br />Ayada Thai<br />Indian Taj<br />Daro&#039;s Pizza and Chicken (Pizza is super cheap and pretty decent, $12 for a 16&quot; hawaiian)<br />Yummy Taco Restaurant (americanized mexican but itâ€™s pretty cheap and chicken/steak is okay quality)<br />UFC<br />Himalayan Yak <br />Super China Pagoda (a notch better than Peking Kitchen)<br />Tropic Pollo<br /><br />There&#039;s been a lot of stuff added in the last couple months that I haven&#039;t tried.

				We tried to get to Ayada tonight, but there was a long wait.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, we went to Spicy Shallot across the street, another place we hadn&#039;t tried in a while.&nbsp; We had the Calamari Salad, Spicy Veggie Duck, and Beef Pad Se-Ew.&nbsp; All were delicious.&nbsp;

				What about Mustang Thakali Kitchen?&nbsp; I stopped in on a whim yesterday afternoon as I was walking by, enticed by their $5.99 lunch special...got the last option on the lunch menu (forgot the name).&nbsp; Wow, was it awesome!&nbsp; The space inside is great too (wish I knew about it sooner), nice, big, clean, and totally easy to bring a young one (if you so desire) without worrying about bumping and squeezing into a annoying small space (high chairs available).<br />Others experiences/suggestions of what to try on their menu?&nbsp; &nbsp;Excited to go back :)

				Everything I&#039;ve tried at Mustang Thakali is delicious -- the momos are my favorite in the neighborhood, and I&#039;m also a huge fan of the thukpa -- noodle soup -- and all the thalis. Great space, friendly service, and a full bar. What&#039;s not to like?
