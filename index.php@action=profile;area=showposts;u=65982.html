					A member with the name Kelso444 posted back a few years ago a question asking if anyone knew of a JH Bartender of the 50&#039;s &amp; 60&#039;s by the name of Billy Brennan. Here&#039;s my reply: I knew Billy Brennan very well if you are referring to the BB that came from a great Irish family located on the north side of Northern Bvd in the low eighties or high seventies. I&#039;d been to his hours once or twice but can&#039;t remember the street. I was friends with him though our high school years and totally lost track after I went into the service in &#039;52. I heard something vague about him moving to Texas but have never confirmed that. If you have any update on him since 1952, I&#039;d love to hear about it. I&#039;m going on 86 so Billy has to be around that age, if he&#039;d still living. Contact me on my email address: <a href="mailto:greatpoobah@aol.com" class="bbc_email">greatpoobah@aol.com</a>&nbsp; Be sure to put Billy Brennan in the subject box. My Name is Howard Giordano<br />

					If you lived in Jackson Heights during the middle 1940&#039;s to the early 1950&#039;s, do you remember a neighborhood sports team called the Jackson Heights Trojans, or any of their members? We numbered around twenty or so teens and to-date, I know half have passed on. There&#039;s about 10 or so I have lost track of. If anyone remembers the team, and know any of the members, post it here and I will give you the names of those I&#039;d like to find to determine if they are still alive and kicking.&nbsp;

					When I was in high school, I had a buddy with the name, Ralph Pollock. He was a consummate gambler, and he insisted that much of his tuition money attending William &amp; Mary College came from his winnings in crap games behind the handball courts of the P.S. 69 schoolyard. Those years were between 1955-1960. Anyone know of the whereabouts of my fabulous friend, Ralph? We kept in touch over the years but like many from the past, we&#039;ve lost contact.

					My family moved to Jackson Heights from Astoria in 1943. We had an apartment on 73rd Street, north of 37th Avenue. I don&#039;t remember the address, but it abutted the building on the corner that was The Blue Haven -- when it was a respectable nightclub. I remember being a Junior Air Raid Warden, and boy didn&#039;t I think I was hot stuff. I went to P.S. 69 from the 3rd to the eighth grade; I was a cub scout at St. Marks Episcopal Church; and went to Mass at St. Joan of Arc. I grew up with a group of boys from the neighborhood that played all sports as a team called The Jackson Heights Trojans. I have so many great memories from that time of my life, I could fill a book. In 1987, Lew Ressequie, Joe Allen (the now famous restaurateur) and myself, Howard Giordano, organized a reunion at a Manhattan east side restaurant. Of the twenty or so kids that played on team at one time or another, we located eighteen guys, but only fourteen could make the reunion date. They came with wives, and one guy who couldn&#039;t make it, sent his sister as a stand-in. The evening turned out to be one of the most nostalgic evenings of my life.<br />More memories on another post.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

We also had a family Victory Garden in our lot (all the neighbors) on the corner of 82nd St. &amp; 35th Ave. NW where we all grew tomatoes, carrots, etc. around the edges. Was in the Cub Scouts at St. Mark&#039;s Pack 201. Pastor was Scofield and Cub Master Fuller. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school (right alongside Garden Country Day) then to kindergarten at P.S. 69, and grammar school at St. Joan of Arc. My folks moved to JH when they were married in 1930 and both passed away in JH in the 80&#039;s. Great memories.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>When my family moved to JH in 1946, I too became a Cub Scout in Pack 201 at St. Mark&#039;s Church. Here&#039;s a list of the kids I grew up with and went to school with who were also Cub Scouts with me in Pack 201: Lou Resseguie, who went on to star in Broadway musicals (and who recently passed away), Joe Allen, who became a hugely successful restaurateur both nationally and internationally, Whitby Ellsworth, Albert McDonald, Gerry Neary and Seth Mosely. This became the nucleolus of our neighborhood sports team known as the Jackson Heights Trojans. In 1986 we organized a reunion of this gang of guys in a restaurant in Manhattan and 14 out of 18 of those we were successful in locating showed up with their wives. Also, one of members who couldn&#039;t attend, had his sister there as a stand-in. And, believe it or not, one of our &quot;Den Mothers&quot; from Pack 201 (the mother of two in the group attending) also came. It was one of the most nostalgic events of my life.&nbsp;

Came back in &#039;59 but relocated to Hempstead, LI while I attended Hofsta Universithy. After graduation in &#039;59, I lived with my family at 35-06 72nd Street for about a year, then got my own apartment in a building at the corner where Broadway and 37th Avenue met (70th Street) for about 2 years, before moving into Manhattan. Your mention of Bobby Polichek made me smile. I remember him so well as one of the best neighborhood athletes, along with Lou Bronzo and his brother. Bobby could run the pants of anyone playing one-on-one with him on the basketball court in P.S.69. He was also a degenerate horse player and hitch-hiked out to Aqueduct almost every day. Aah, memories. I&#039;ve got a boatload of them.

When I returned from Korea in 1956, our crowd did all our drinking in this bar. It had a piano player in those days, and just the mention of it brings back so many memories.

					I was preparing a eulogy to give at my dear friend&#039;s service in two week - we both grew up in the Jackson Heights of the 1940s-1950s. While on-line searching for &quot;Jackson Heights of the 1950s,&quot; I stumbled upon this wonderful web site.<br /><br />I will be 86 years old in one month and predictably nostalgic about my youth. I lived at 35-06 72nd Street for years, graduated from P.S. 69, attended and graduated from The McBurney Prep School in Manhattan, spent four years in the USAF, then came home to attend and graduate from Hofstra University. I spent my early career in advertising on Madison Avenue with the celebrated Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency, among others, before I moved into the Thoroughbred Racing Industry for 11 years - New York Racing Association &amp; President of NYC-OTB. I&#039;ve been retired and living in Naples, Florida with my wife for the past 23 years. I was recently saddened by the passing of my dear friend, Lew, with whom I&#039;d remained friends with for the past 76 years since first meeting him at St. Marks Church in Jackon Heights where we were members of the Cub Scouts, Pack 201. Lew, after a career in Broadway theater, retired with his wife to Sun City, Florida up near Tampa where our childhood friendship carried on. If anyone reading this recognizes me or Lew, please post a reply. It would be so nice to hear from and about old friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
