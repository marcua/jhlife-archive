					Just a friendly reminder that TONIGHT, Monday, November 15, 2010, Assemblymember Michael DenDekker (D-Jackson Heights) will sponsor an Insurance Preparedness Town Hall meeting in Queens. The event, which will be held at the Lexington School for the Deaf at 7:00 p.m., is free-of-charge and open to the public.&nbsp; It has been designed to educate residents in the 34th Assembly District on the importance of making sure that they understand how to best document the condition of their property prior to an emergency â€“ as well as those steps that can be taken before, during, and after an emergency to better protect their property.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œWith winter right around the corner, now is the time to become better educated about preparing your property for potentially destructive weather or other emergencies,â€ Assemblymember DenDekker said.&nbsp; â€œThe bottom line is: after an emergency or disaster, who pays for the damage?â€<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In September of 2010, a tornado and macroburst moved through sections of Queens, downing trees and power lines, and damaging vehicles and buildings.&nbsp; â€œAlthough the City of New York, along with its state partners, responded quickly to this emergency, it took time for property owners to document their losses,â€ Assemblymember DenDekker said.&nbsp; â€œBy learning now how to properly document a property for insurance purposes, it could potentially save you time, money, and aggravation should a similar event occur in the future.â€<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Residents will be able to speak with representatives from various insurance companies, the New York City Office of Emergency Management, the Comptrollerâ€™s Office of the City of New York, the American Red Cross, ConEd, and others about their disaster insurance policies.&nbsp; In addition, representatives will be on hand to answer questions about how to file a claim against the City for disaster-related damage, and other emergency preparedness issues.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lexington School for the Deaf is located on 75th Street, between 25th and 30th Avenues, in Jackson Heights, Queens.&nbsp; The event â€“ which will be held in the auditorium - will run from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; Further information can be obtained by calling (718) 457-0384.&nbsp; We&#039;re looking forward to seeing you there!

					Dear Friends,<br /><br />With identity theft at an all-time high, now is the time to protect your privacy and your vital information.<br /><br />This June, my office is sponsoring three document shredding days in the 34th Assembly district. &nbsp;The events, which are free-of-charge, will be held on:<br /><br /><strong>June 12, 2010<br />11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.<br />Jackson Heights Shopping Center<br />77th Street and 31st Avenue<br /><br />June 19, 2010<br />10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.<br />Northern Playground, 93rd Street off Northern Boulevard<br /><br />June 26, 2010<br />10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.<br />Woodside Post Office<br />39-25 61st Street</strong><br /><br />All residents are urged to bring in their discarded documents and watch them shredded into harmless confetti. &nbsp;That way, youâ€™ll know your financial and other sensitive information has been destroyed and your privacy protected.<br /><br />In addition, the shredding operations are environmentally-friendly. &nbsp;The refuse from this event will be properly recycled, thereby protecting the environment at the same time securing your personal information.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Donâ€™t fall victim to identity theft. &nbsp;Take this opportunity to shred your important documents!<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><br />Michael DenDekker<br />Member of Assembly<br />
