				Where does one find out the specifics on subletting policies for co-ops? &nbsp;Is this info typically located in a specific place in the co-op documents, i.e. the offering plan? <br />Usually, I&#039;ve seen sales listings for co-ops, and if subletting is allowed, then that&#039;s stated as part of the ad. &nbsp;I&#039;ve taken this statement at face value and never thought to investigate further for written verification until now. &nbsp;<br /><br />Can the board of a building that has a liberal subletting policy change this to a no subletting rule?<br />Also, can a buyer request that subletting policy details be added to a contract when purchasing a co-op? <br /><br />Any insights shared on this issue would be much appreciated!

				The coop&#039;s subletting policy is often found in the proprietary lease, though bylaws and house rules can also reiterate or include specific information. Subletting rules are set by the coop board. In that respect, any personal arrangements you might make in your purchase contract will continue to be subject to the coop&#039;s policy. <br /><br />The board can change its policy, of course. A few buildings in the neighborhood have recently shifted to more liberal policies, though they retain strict control -- putting in place limits to, f.ex., maximum length, or maximum number of apts that can be sublet at the same time, or period of time after which subletting becomes allowed. Owner occupancy is a factor for mortgage lenders so it&#039;s important to consider all aspects when deciding on a policy.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				Hello everyone!<br /><br />I am a real estate broker, and as part of my job I read a multitude of publications. The one I like to read most in regards to coops (which are most of my business in Jackson Heights specifically) is called the Cooperator. It began as a print publication and is now available on line. I keep an archive of the articles that address common questions.<br /><br />Here is the article that specifically addresses this subject:<br /><br />http://cooperator.com/articles/1564/1/Rules-and-Problems/Page1.html<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Armen J. Meschian <br />Associate Broker at Exit Realty Landmark<br />www.jacksonheightslistings.com<br />
