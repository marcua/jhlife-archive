				<strong>I stage a lot of apartments but I am stuck with too much furniture at this time and my storage is packed with equipment and other stuff.<br />I have no available apartments that require staging other than those in contract I am thinking of giving away a few items.&nbsp; I have a large sofa and love seat in Corona in an apartment that is going to close soon.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to bring it to the storage and I don&#039;t have another large apartment to bring it to.&nbsp; It was cleaned professionally a few months ago and it&#039;s in good &amp; solid condition.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whoever wants it simply emails me and just pick it up from 59-21 Calloway St. in Corona.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t ask me to help you bring it out to your truck...I&#039;m giving it free and I have not offered it to anyone else at this time since I have about a month or so before I close on it.&nbsp; If there are no takers I&#039;ll put a flier in the building, but I rather have people from other than the building contact me to avoid the possibility of people coming up to me and asking if there are other things I want to give away (like a plasma TV or bar stools...LOL)&nbsp; First come first serve.&nbsp; Here is a picture of it in one of the apartments.&nbsp; I&#039;ll take a picture or two sometime when I get there next week or so. </strong> &nbsp;

				I&#039;m not at the bldg today.&nbsp; I have used those sofas in several units.&nbsp; All you have to do is enter it sideway and at an angle.&nbsp; How wide is your door?&nbsp; I can get the dimensions next week, maybe this weekend.
