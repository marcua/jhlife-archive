We are very happy that Danny has allocated a nice sum of money to improve the plaza. But that does not mean that there will be immediate improvements. There will still be a whole process to go through, and we can shorten the length of this process by applying a little pressure.<br /><br />By signing this petition, it will give Danny the political leverage he needs to request improvements from DOT on our behalf. So let&#039;s help Danny help us. There are a good number of signatures already, but we need many more. And it really only takes a minute at most.

					Looking good! I wish them luck in this new space. I peeked through the window last week and it seems like there was still a bit of finishing to do before it&#039;s fit for occupancy. But it seems it&#039;s almost there.

The process will be gradual, but this really is good news. Hats off to Dromm for making this allocation.<br /><br />That said, it is clear that there are still concerns in the neighborhood. This is understandable. A number of community members have been active in the past several weeks drafting an online petition to Dromm to do what he can to expedite the improvement process. The petition was launched today and is found here: <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/665/898/285/improve-37th-road-plaza-diversity-plaza-in-jackson-heights/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/665/898/285/improve-37th-road-plaza-diversity-plaza-in-jackson-heights/</a><br /><br />We seem to be moving in the right direction, but with some more public pressure, we may see improvements come more quickly. The petition makes clear that we welcome this plaza and look forward to its development, but hope that the city steps it up a bit. All who agree are encouraged to sign.<br /><br />Kudos too to all those helping to put on events in the plaza, and assisting with maintenance and beautification. With these types of initiatives--and some political nudging via petition--we ought to be able to create a very pleasant space on 37th Road.

					I was in the area this past weekend and swung by the bookstore. It&#039;s a really great space with a pretty small but very well-selected selection of books in my opinion. They are on 31st Street, beside the elevated N/Q, so there&#039;s not a whole of foot traffic, which should help with rent, but you never know. Hopefully, word of mouth will be enough to sustain them. I definitely recommend stopping by and supporting them.

					I think pester makes fair points. The streets are pretty congested, but I notice that they are congested even on blocks with no vendors at all. One positive thing about 24/7 vendors is that they provide eyes on the street late at night. This is good security for people coming home late from work. But I do wonder about the security of the vendors themselves.<br /><br />Your points are well-taken though. I didn&#039;t grow up here, but my sense is that it is just a much denser neighborhood than it used to be. Maybe I&#039;m wrong.

It&#039;s not a matter of allowance; it&#039;s a matter of demand. Save for Green Carts, which are reserved for food deserts, a merchant can basically set up shop wherever he wants. Louis Vuitton stores are allowed in Brownsville. Vendors selling plastic sunglasses are allowed on the Upper East Side. There&#039;s no statute saying where people are allowed to sell stuff. Concern over congestion is one thing, but it&#039;s not like the city issues permits to certain neighborhoods. Permits are issued to individuals who in turn locate and vend where there&#039;s demand for their goods.

In terms of street vendors posing a threat to storefront businesses, consider the numbers: In 1900, the city had a population of about 3.5 million. This was also the heyday of street vendors, who totaled about 25,000 in number. That&#039;s a ratio of 1 vendor per every 140 residents. Did this result in the collapse of the commercial economy? Did entire commercial strips hollow out and convert to pushcarts? Today, there are let&#039;s say 8 million residents of the city with vendors numbering around 12,000, at a ratio of about 1 vendor per 667 residents. This idea that street vendors threaten to upend the brick-and-mortar business might have been plausible a century ago, but it certainly didn&#039;t play out that way.&nbsp; Claiming that they continue to be a threat to commercial corridors today just doesn&#039;t stack up against the historical record.<br /><br />But even if they were a threat, isn&#039;t it true that every fruit vendor is a threat to every other fruit vendor? This is what competition is about. Permitted fruit vendors by definition have permission to compete with other fruit vendors. As for the halal vendor on 82nd and 37th, name me one business within a 5-block radius that he is even competing with.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=8797.msg50240.html#msg50240">Quote from: jhlifer on September 04, 2013, 02:38:30 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The brick-and-mortar businesses are more likely to pay sales taxes and by virtue of their investment in our community, more likely to be responsible local citizens.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not sure which part of this statement to response to first. For starters, businesses do not pay sales tax; they collect them. Any business, whether storefront or not, must charge applicable sales tax. As for being good local citizens, let us not forget the Times Square t-shirt vendor who alerted police to a smoking car-bomb a couple years ago (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/nyregion/02timessquare.html?pagewanted=all" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/nyregion/02timessquare.html?pagewanted=all</a>). This is anecdotal of course, but it&#039;s not a law of nature that storefront businesses are more ethical than street vendors.<br /><br />Basically, this backlash against street vendors is something of a canard, and a very very dated one at that. If we want to ensure that they&#039;re adhering to city regulations, that&#039;s one thing, and a very worthy cause in my mind. Attacking the entire business model as criminal or underhanded or economically destructive is absurd.

					We had a very positive and productive meeting this evening among neighborhood residents and the folks at SUKHI. About a dozen people showed up, which is already many more than the three that met with Dromm&#039;s office last week.<br /><br />We are well on our way towards forming a local coalition to improve this plaza. Tonight was very encouraging and everyone offered their personal concerns and ideas about this space, so we have our foot in the door. But we will need even more people to make sure that this initiative makes an impact. Anyone who has concerns about this plaza or good ideas about its improvement is encouraged to join us.<br /><br />We will be creating an email group to communicate with each other, drafting petitions to submit to city agencies, and coming up with ways to assist SUKHI in making this space attractive. We all have a sense of what the problem is, but this is an opportunity to be part of the solution. If you are interested in getting on board, please reach out. Everyone&#039;s participation is very much welcomed and needed.

					This conflict over street vendors is as old as the city itself. For those opposed to this business model, I would note that the number of street vendors today is just a small fraction of what it used to be. Brick-and-mortar businesses, and eventually municipal government, have been hostile towards these vendors for centuries. This partnership has virtually wiped out this type of business, so what we see today is just a remnant of what used to be. That said, the concerns that some people have expressed about fraud are real. Food vendors need to get permits from a couple different agencies. Demand for these permits among immigrants is astronomically high, so it is common that people acquire these permits and licenses and lease them out to others at a ridiculous markup. We cannot tell which vendors have gotten their permits from the city, or which are leasing them. But the business is rough, and many of the food vendors around the city are forking over huge sums of profits to the official permit-holders—which incidentally includes money to pay taxes--, are working twelve-hour shifts, make sub-poverty incomes, and have zero benefits or job security. As for effects on brick-and-mortar businesses, I understand the concern, but where in our competitive market-based system does it state that enterprises have to be affixed to the ground?

					To get back on point, just a reminder: For everyone available tomorrow evening at 7:30pm, we will be meeting at Bombay Chat--aka Net Solutions--at 73-19 37th Road to talk about how we as a community will bring improvements to this plaza. All are welcome, and the more people are involved, the greater our impact will be. Let&#039;s try to use this unfinished space as an opportunity for neighborhood cohesion, not division.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/211116732389485/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/211116732389485/</a>

					We should not compare Diversity Plaza with other city plazas because it came about in a unique way. Normally, an established local organization puts in a request to DOT for a plaza (Jackson Heights Green Alliance and the 78th Street Playstreet; Queens Econonic Development Corporation and Corona Plaza). In the case of Diversity Plaza, this space was the result of a study DOT did a couple years ago in which they recommended the closure of this street to traffic (<a href="http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/recommendations-new-public-space/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/jackson-heights/recommendations-new-public-space/</a>).<br /><br />As Jeff said, SUKHI is just two people who are are busy running their businesses and were pro-active enough to take on this plaza when no one else would. We should not wait around for them to broadcast appeals for assistance. And I would not necessarily assume that they are members of this forum and hearing these concerns. So, instead, let&#039;s step up ourselves, pay them a visit next Wednesday at 7:30pm, get to know them, eat, hang out, and see what we can do to to help.<br /><br />If anyone has unanswered questions, pressing concerns, or productive ideas, next Wednesday will be an opportunity to get them out into the open and actually be effectual.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/211116732389485/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/211116732389485/</a>
