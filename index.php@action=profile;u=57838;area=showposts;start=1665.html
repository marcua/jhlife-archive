					This is a thread for folks complaining about the changes in airplane routes that have been implemented in the last few years...due to the new GPS based technology utilized by planes landing and departing from LGA... which enables planes to fly exactly the same route, with a separation of only a minute or so...and is a brand spanking novel ear-shattering development...and annoyance.<br /><br />Does that make it clearer for you JHLIFER35?

					Before I escape the neighborhood again today...or else be driven insane by this barrage of jets in my ear...we should be aware that other airports around the nation have been forced to sound insulate the homes that are affected by their plane noise....perhaps this is really the only practical solution to this terrible problem. Legally they are liable for the costs of soundproofing.

					Often it takes outsiders or strangers...like the French gal looking for &quot;Sweetleaf&quot; in the article... to see what locals can&#039;t.<br /><br />That&#039;s because the NY Times journalists and others in NYC seem to have baggage about what Queens was over 10 or even 30 years ago...(for instance those sitcoms that the new generation has never heard of)...&nbsp; <br /><br />And so it takes the new (young) generation to really see what&#039;s in front of them...a Queens which is completely unique in its diversity in the entire world...and fascinating. Absolutely authentic while the rest of the world is beginning to look exactly the same. Be it Paris or Manhattan or London or Brooklyn or wherever. Kinda like different versions of a very nice shopping mall.<br /><br />Most of Queens certainly doesn&#039;t look like that. (Yet?)<br /><br />Meanwhile many old folks appear to be perplexed over what tourists and visitors are exactly seeing. <br />That ambivalent journalist certainly is in that article.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					Yes that&#039;s the point.<br /><br />Unfortunately my timing ain&#039;t the best...to be exactly here...in Jax Hts...specifically (and only) concerning this particular plane noise issue... I&#039;ve accepted that fact.<br /><br />Things...are often about timing...<br /><br />I have to think about it...<br /><br />The simplest method at the moment...is for us to keep complaining to the authorities...and let them know that the tolerance for plane noise is not &quot;moderate&quot; as they seem to think on their site...but &quot;low&quot;... <br /><br />And in 25 or more years....or whatever......Stewart Airport will be have to be built for NYC to keep flourishing.<br /><br />Call me a visionary!

					Thanks for the article...<br /><br />So, basically, another factor is if we wait 10 years...the plane noise MAY POSSIBLY be decreased by half due to a new jet design.<br /><br />Ten years.<br /><br />Hmmmm....<br /><br />The only upside of all this...is that I have become more knowledgeable about planes and airports... than I ever imagined I&#039;d be.<br /><br />And no doubt there&#039;s far more to be learned... in this multi-factorial challenge...that reaches from the top echelons of entrenched government and community habits to me...being woken up at 6am on a weekend to be bombarded by endlessly screaming jets...in my ear...driving me crazy. <br /><br />

					Hello there...<br /><br />I have not disappeared...but am simply pondering the best modus operandi...to approach this airplane noise issue...<br /><br />Yes, forming a group that tackles it is a fine idea...<br /><br />The thing is... I went to that meeting @ the high school PS69, a couple of years ago...concerning airplane noise and how it has increased in Jax Hts due to that new technology they&#039;re using....enabling planes to land/depart within 30 seconds or whatever of each other...in exactly the same route...which is why there is a barrage of jets over our heads...in almost precisely the same way each time.<br /><br />At the meeting the authorities promised to consider our community&#039;s concerns.<br /><br />My true feeling now...after a couple of years...is the method the Port Authority uses to consider our concerns... is to determine how much plane noise we put up with...in other words, how much they can get away with. <br /><br />So the more we complain, I suppose, the more they realize the less we&#039;ll put up with it.<br /><br />Really, however, my guess... is that they will only truly sit up and take notice if legal action is taken. Because I bet the Port Authority is fearful that if airports are forced to curtail their jet noise pollution by the courts...like other precedents that have been achieved around the nation, the courts would discover that the noise decibels we must put up with are so high they would be illegal. The Port Authority would be forced to insulate 100&#039;s? or 1000&#039;s? of apartments...very expensive.<br /><br />And the trouble, of course, is that NYC needs jets to zoom in and out...to compete in the world...and it&#039;s the circular argument again of a magnificent 24/7 airport worthy of this city (Stewart Airport!) ...or continuing with these band-aid solutions which cause pain...and operate at illegal decibel levels for neighborhoods.<br /><br />I was also thinking about how some folks want to be good neighbors with LGA.&nbsp; I do understand that. <br />The trouble is LGA&#039;s technology has changed...in the last 3 years... and our neighbor LGA is now making so much noise... that if other neighbors created such a disturbance...the situation would end up with the police being called...and the neighbors fined.<br /><br />To love a neighbor who is abusing us, due to new technology which allows departing/landing jets to follow the exact same routes with only a minute or so intervals between them...is in my opinion akin to suffering from &quot;battered wife syndrome&quot;. Loving the very thing that has quite recently began abusing us far worse than it used to.<br /><br />I will keep considering this issue...and which option/path might be the best to follow... It is pretty complicated.<br /><br />Life, after all, is choices...and we all should have them...in a free country.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

					Hmmm....it sounds to me that you are suggesting too much activism might lead to a permanent home at the bottom of the East River.<br /><br />I do see the irony that you believe the culture of the Mafia is not gone...but is instead used to run the government.<br /><br />At the end of the day...these issues make our lives unbearable.<br /><br />History shows when things get unbearable enough...then folks will revolt.<br />That is simply gong to be a question of time. It&#039;s obvious. The noise will get worse in the years and decades to come. There will be more planes from LGA. More noise. That is the sad fact and I will take it into consideration. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					Try Changi in Singapore then. <br /><br />I am aware that LGA is planned to get a makeover...<br />But it will never be that 24/7 airport which NYC needs. <br />Though my guess is the authorities might try and lift the curfew <br />once it is rebuilt.<br /><br />Hopefully then even the &#039;put up with it&#039; folks will be galvanized to action. Hah...<br /><br /><br />

					NYC is not the only world city that has had to deal with this problem. Paris built the Charles De Gaulle airport.... We are in the 21st century...and the problem will have to be addressed...NYC is a world city...and needs to find solutions to these issues...that other world cities have done...and are also facing...the truth is that NYC needs a 24/7 world class airport...and the airports it currently has...will&nbsp; never fulfill its long term needs. And unless NYC bites the bullet...and builds a 24 hour magnificent airport...somewhere...and I say Stewart Airport is the frontrunner...it will fall behind on the world stage.<br /><br />LGA will never be the 24/7 magnificent airport worthy of this city...and its future..and the authorities would<br />Do better to admit that...now...and create a proper vision for NYC&#039;s future. And not one where the city&#039;s inhabitants suffer...from what is really a regional size airport from the 1930s...overtaxed trying to cope with 21st century air traffic for a new era and beyond. That is simply the reality of the situation. And until it is accepted...much suffering will happen...for us.

					Your argument, dssjh... is exactly the same as the one used by the fracking industry.<br /><br />Fracking brings jobs/stimulates the economy.<br /><br />Meanwhile it poisons the environment...but &quot;put up with it&quot;.<br /><br />In our case LGA is poisoning and torturing us with noise pollution.<br />And we are also meant to &quot;put up with it&quot;.<br /><br />Everything changes.&nbsp; Times change. Folks are no longer passive and prepared to &quot;put up with&quot; what those in the past did.<br /><br />New industries will sprout where old ones were.&nbsp; Do you have no creative optimism?<br />The Brooklyn Navy Yards no longer make ships.&nbsp; And are now re-purposed. There are any examples of that in the world. Old jobs disappear.&nbsp; New ones are created.&nbsp; That&#039;s the dynamism of life itself.<br /><br />LGA could be movie studio.&nbsp; A 3d Printing facility.&nbsp; A new flower market.&nbsp; Hotels can be repurposed into schools. The opportunities are endless.<br />The future beckons.<br /><br />Some are fearful of letting go of the past.&nbsp; Others see new options everywhere.<br /><br />Meanwhile I agree with the poster above...we are the ones suffering...unable to enjoy our weeknights...and half our weekends...awoken by jets @ 6am and past midnight.<br /><br />(The planes start now most weeknights @ 10pm.)<br /><br />The only real option is to leave the neighborhood...either for the day...and hope the planes are over by the time you get back (often they&#039;re not)...or, of course, to leave the neighborhood and Queens for good...to its fate...engulfed by airport noise pollution.<br /><br />It is a horror...and wasn&#039;t like this a couple of years ago...and will only get worse if LGA expands.<br /><br />Stewart Airport has a perimeter of land around specifically created to isolate planes landings/departures from the communities surrounding it.<br /><br />With LGA, we are the perimeter around it.<br /><br />It is time for LGA to go.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					The high speed train will take the workers to the Stewart Airport in half an hour.<br /><br />They will even be able to buy a discount monthly pass.<br /><br />Lots of folks commute to work.&nbsp; I have.
