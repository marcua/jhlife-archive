				It does not make sense to me that several stores are operating on shorted hours and&nbsp; and days opened.&nbsp; You would think that the stores would stay open longer to reduce the length of waiting times and lines.&nbsp; What&#039;s the reason for this?

				That is a great question. It&#039;s like the situation has been made more crowded which is the opposite of what is necessary.

				for the benefit of the workers, who are at risk, and working in smaller numbers as their colleagues fall ill. grocery workers face a staggering COVID 19 toll. anyone wishing to help out should take a part time gig at one of the stores.

				The answer is N-95 masks.<br /><br />Which should have been the answer from the beginning. N-95 masks should have been distributed to every USA inhabitant to avert this disease. <br /><br />That would&#039;ve been real and useful action by leaders. More than social distancing. More than surgical masks. Scientifically, N-95 masks protect the wearer. (And others). In the weeks since this situation started I am amazed a country like the USA could not produce N-95 masks for us all. And avert stopping the nation. <br /><br />

				Masks are only as effective as the people wearing them. If you go outside at all, you&#039;ll see people taking their masks off to smoke, drink, clear their fogged up eyeglasses, etc. And people constantly touch their masks to adjust them, but that transfers any virus load to their hands. Doctors and nurses and first responders wear the best PPE available but still get sick. People have to stop believing in magical solutions and listen to the experts who are trying to save their lives instead of to the people that need to make a payment on their Mercedes.

				Some of the larger chains that cut hours had press releases that said they were doing so in order to&nbsp; allow staff time to stock shelves, as well as clean and thoroughly disinfect store surfaces to protect employees and customers.
