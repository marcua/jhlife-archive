					I know exactly how you feel. Honestly the only silver lining of the pandemic was the end of these terrible, horrible Saturday mornings. Then the moment the city declares it&#039;s reopened it&#039;s like LGA and the FAA are like &quot;wait a minute, we haven&#039;t made the residents of Jackson Heights miserable in a while; better get on that!&quot;<br /><br />But seriously, I&#039;ve never been able to understand the need for this. They claim it&#039;s runway maintenance/renovation; well, haven&#039;t they had a year and a half to do exactly that? Also, even just one more hour of sleep would go a long way towards not completely ruining my entire weekend. The noise seems to have stopped; why couldn&#039;t they have let me sleep until 7 or 8am before jolting me awake like I&#039;m in some kind of war zone?? It is truly psychological torture.<br /><br />On a side note, has anyone found a successful means of getting through this? I turn my AC unit to high and jam earplugs in my ears so deeply I get ear pain. It doesn&#039;t really make any difference.

					I&#039;m an adult who doesn&#039;t know how to drive. There, I said it.<br /><br />But since learning is one of my pandemic (or post-pandemic) goals, and I&#039;m sure there are a lot of local parents whose kids had to learn at one time or another, I&#039;m wondering if you can chime in.<br /><br />What are the best local driving schools and do you have specific teachers to recommend at them?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!

Driving a truck (as is a car) west to east on 37th ave in the 70&#039;s is a total nightmare, with all that double parking from the shops there. So the trucks are sliding past that on Northern and crossing over to 37th or Roosevelt on 80th st.<br /><br />What kills me is how this city permits enormous 16 wheel semi trucks to make deliveries to say, that tiny Dunkin Donuts on 37th Ave. The whole shop can fit in that truck. We let these big corporations kill our neighborhood because their bottom line is more important than our quality of life.<br /><br />I am kinda sick of everyone scapegoating the open streets. This area is so lacking in public open spaces, it&#039;s ridiculous. 34th Ave being open is clearly filling a very important need in our community. And I say that as a car owner.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This has been exactly my theory for a while as well, and it&#039;s infuriating. But you&#039;d think the trucks delivering to the 70s on 37th Avenue would drive down an earlier sidestreet, ditto the trucks delivering to the 80s going down a higher one. Like, wouldn&#039;t ever truck just drive Northern until it reached the numbered street closest to its delivery point?<br /><br />In any case, I agree with you Open Streets probably has nothing to do with this.

					Hi all,<br /><br />I&#039;m selling my NEW, NEVER USED folding E-bike for $500 (original price, including shipping, was $700+). Bought it last year, but then inherited a vintage bike from my parents and found that one preferable, so it sat in my basement storage space until now.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the listing:<br /><br /><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B089VX4M75/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B089VX4M75/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a><br /><br />I&#039;m in the Greystones. Please feel free to get in touch to arrange a time to come by and check it out: <a href="mailto:giulia.pines@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">giulia.pines@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Giulia

					I must admit I&#039;m surprised by the &quot;no guests&quot; rule as I honestly would have expected the opposite! I live in the Greystones and the gardens have been invaluable in terms of meeting up with friends I otherwise wouldn&#039;t see it all (many of whom wouldn&#039;t have wanted to come to Queens in the before times). <br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to write, everyone!

					Hi all,<br /><br />Longtime lurker, first time poster. I&#039;m just curious to know whether any of you who live in garden co-ops have had the rules change as a result of the pandemic. I know some buildings are very strict about the kinds of activities that go on in their courtyard green spaces. Maybe more sports are allowed now? Maybe one that was very strict about noise has let things go a bit so kids can run around and have fun?<br /><br />As an aside, I am a journalist, so this is me researching a possible article as well as just being curious. I certainly won&#039;t quote you unless you say I can <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Thanks!<br />Giulia
