				si, I have read your comments, and now, I want to respond to your remarks. While everyone is certainly entitled to openly expressing his/her opinions across the board, I do want to let you know that the majority of Flea Markets, held in Jackson Heights and elsewhere around town, are basically outdoors/on the street, so that everyone can enjoy these events; have fun shopping outside; take advantage of the fresh air and get great bargains on all kinds of new/antique treasures. Additionally, you need to know that all organizers of Flea Markets (and all vendors who pay $$$, in order to sell at these events) work extremely hard to prepare for each event. Oh, and by the by, just so you are aware, all Flea Market Permits, which legally allow each event to be held on the street, must be applied for and granted by the City, well in advance of every Flea Market date, paid for by the applicable Flea Market organizer. I trust that I have adequately addressed your queries/concerns about Flea Markets being held outside on the street.
