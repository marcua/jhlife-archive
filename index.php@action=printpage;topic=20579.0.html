				I saw the store sign that the owner is retiring so everything is 50% before the doors close one last time. A lovely small business and it&#039;s a stationery store too!

				Personally I will miss this store.&nbsp; It was always my first stop for anything related to stationary.&nbsp; String, packing tape, padded envelopes, foamcore, paint brushes, pens, etc..&nbsp; <br />my own experiences there were great, I never had an issue.&nbsp; I am sad to see it closing as it’s a throwback to an earlier time.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Sad to see this store go. Very helpful. The inventory was not only art supplies. There were some good gifts in there too. Too bad, but happy retirement to the owner!

				&nbsp;<br />This is another loss that strips away the character of the neighborhood. This used to be a community of small shops run by shopkeepers who were part of the community. Now we get soulless chains that are interchangeable with any other branch in any other state. I fear that we are on the cusp of a return to the decline of previous years. I hope this is not a small indicator of that.

Some people are still not comfortable riding the subway, so patronizing within our own neighborhood has become benefits for many essential businesses.

				I will miss them.&nbsp; I enjoy shopping at smaller businesses when possible and their selection was eclectic, and it was great having them in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am glad that it seems this is truly a retirement choice and not related to rising rents or the pandemic.

And the business continues under new ownership while the owner pockets the goodwill $ for his/her retirement. <br /><br />This is not the case here. Obviously the owner wasn&#039;t able to sell the business. Possibly because in an online selling environment, plus the move to digital art... a retail business like that is no longer profitable.
