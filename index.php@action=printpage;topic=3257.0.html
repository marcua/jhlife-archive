				Does anyone remember Eddie Rowe who lived in Jackson Heights in the 1970&#039;s and 80&#039;s? He was always in trouble with the law, went to bryant high school, dropped out, and married Giselle Erba. He was a handy man who loved to cook. He had a problematic family life.&nbsp; His cousin Catherine killed herself in JH in the late 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m Catherine Rowe, Eddie&#039;s daughter. I&#039;m looking for him, and anyone who might have ran with him back in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, or (here&#039;s a long shot) still does. <br /><br />Thank you.
