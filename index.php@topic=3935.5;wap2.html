			I used to play softball in the schoolyard even in the winter, we were hard core softball addicts. This was during the<br />mid 80&#039;s, eventually we moved on to Travers Park. On sunday mornings we would practice for a few hours, Nick who worked<br />for the Post office was like almost 70 yrs old(he would pitch) but the rest of us were in our teens to early 20&#039;s.<br /><br />It was a good sized yard to play softball in. We would alternate where home plate would be, sometimes on the 77th St<br />side and other times on the 78th St side, good times.

			When I was in high school, I had a buddy with the name, Ralph Pollock. He was a consummate gambler, and he insisted that much of his tuition money attending William &amp; Mary College came from his winnings in crap games behind the handball courts of the P.S. 69 schoolyard. Those years were between 1955-1960. Anyone know of the whereabouts of my fabulous friend, Ralph? We kept in touch over the years but like many from the past, we&#039;ve lost contact.

			In the late 50s I remember playing slapball on the 77th Street side of the handball courts before school started. Played puchball during recess. Played stickball every Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday&#039;s would also play softball on the 78th Street field with older guys when they needed players.<br />
