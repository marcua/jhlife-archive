			The people at Trader Joe&#039;s in Forest Hills have told me to get my friends and<br />neighbors to fill out the Location Request form on their website. They know how<br />crowded that Queens location has become and they say their bosses take the<br />emails and requests seriously. I think it&#039;s a long shot, but it can&#039;t hurt. If<br />you want another Trader Joe&#039;s in Queens and particularly in our area, please go<br />to this link:<br />http://www.traderjoes.com/about/location-requests-form.asp<br />Please cut and paste if it does not work directly.<br />

			Hmmm, not sure I&#039;d want trader joe&#039;s in my neighborhood exactly (big corporation), but they are pretty good. <br />I&#039;d rather fairway, but even they are getting too big that it&#039;s gotta hurt smaller stores. <br /><br />maybe they should put one in flushing, or maybe at near the museum of moving image.

			I totally agree with Jeff. If it&#039;s going to be a major chain store, let it be one that brings the neighborhood good union jobs like Fairway-- definitely not a Trader Joe&#039;s.

			Trader Joes? NO WAY! They exploit the environment, exploit suppliers, exploit communities, and exploit workers! Trader Joe&#039;s is no better than wal mart in all of their practices, in fact they use the same playbook. If you really want a food distributor try, as Jeff said Fairway or a ShopRite. Say No to Trader Joe&#039;s. http://www.traitorjoe.com/index.htm or http://www.traitorjoesny.com/

You should read your own links more closely -- that one is full of &quot;victory!&quot; messages.<br /><br />As far as the other link (http://www.traitorjoesny.com/) -- apparently Trader Joes&#039; isn&#039;t a union shop? Too bad (I do support unions, and have been a union member in the past). However, there are much worse grocery chains the UFCW could be pressuring -- for example, Key Foods and Associated supermarkets, where in some cases, like the Bushwick Associated, employees make less than the minimum wage (there&#039;s a lawsuit there). In other locations, they merely make minimum wage. I&#039;m not an expert on the topic but from what I understand, employees at Trader Joes are compensated relatively well, and have good benefits (including health insurance options, if I&#039;m not mistaken).<br /><br />I like Trader Joes and I will continue to shop there - they have great prices on staples like yogurt, half &amp; half, nuts, olive oil, lean ground beef, frozen vegetables, egg whites, and other categories. The quality is better than my local Associated, and so are the prices.<br /><br />However, I do respect the concept of keeping &#039;big box&#039; stores from opening in the neighborhood.
