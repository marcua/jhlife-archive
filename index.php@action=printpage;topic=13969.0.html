				I have never visited the first Foodcellar location since it seemed out of the way, but I might make an effort to visit this one, since it&#039;s close to the subway.<br /><br />Foodcellar<br />43-10 Crescent St. LIC<br />https://www.facebook.com/212498922148570/posts/951348331596955/<br /><br />Unfortunately the reviews from the first location are not that great.&nbsp; http://www.yelp.com/biz/foodcellar-and-co-market-long-island-city?osq=food+cellar<br />(https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/12191018_951347978263657_2303934652359222832_n.jpg?oh=7b536f0b8405360296aa32f1d43725e1&amp;oe=56C0E8D0)

				I love the first one in LIC. So nice and spacious, with a great variety of products. I wish we could get one!

				I used to go to the original quite often and while the selection is good, the prices were never. Much prefer going to 37th Ave spots like Lemon Farm, Appetito, etc. And it&#039;s certainly no Fairway... If we&#039;re going to sell out our neighborhood, at least do it for a Fairway... <br /><br /><br />OR the Food Bazaar on Northern that&#039;s incredible. But I&#039;m fine with keeping it there and NIMBY

				After reading their Yelp reviews, I will pass. Seems they have a lot of issues with freshness of their products and customer service. I&#039;ll stick to whole foods.
