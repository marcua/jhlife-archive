				I was wondering if anyone received anti Moya literature in the mail funded by the Monserrate campaign?&nbsp; What a low life dirt bag Monserrate is. He would make good material for a SNL skit....if anyone had the stomach to play his role. You would think that a guy with half a brain would humble himself and take a break to reflect....just as a matter of being a human &quot;becoming&quot;....NOT!

				yep, got one.<br /><br />the fat thug&#039;s main point seems to be that moya has lost a couple of elections, therefore is not worth voting for.<br /><br />if memory serves, Monster Rat got about one percent of the vote last time out.....family members and serial criminals seem to be firmly on his side.<br /><br />not that moya can coast, but in reality, i think fat boy needs to learn several translations of &#039;want fries with that?<br />

				I got the same thing...essentially it said, <em>Don&#039;t vote for Moya. he&#039;s lost some elections before.</em> I sort of giggled at its impotence as a negative mailing.

				My pledge is to not vote for anyone in the 39th.&nbsp; I will go to vote and write in a &quot;Blank Vote&quot;<br />No one should be fooled by the corrupt Tamany Hall in Queens.&nbsp; No way&nbsp; one guy is a bum and the other a corrupt Lobbyist<br />VOTE NONE OF THE ABOVE SEPT. 14!

				I gotta say, abstaining in this kind of race is probably one of the worst things that one can do.<br /><br />I understand the principle involved but in this race, we have a convicted criminal and a man that sliced his girlfriends face.&nbsp; This is a very bad man and I for one have no desire to have a man such of this represent our community in any capacity of government.

				Please see my response to a previous thread started by &quot;Tony T&quot;:<br /><br />One of Hiram Monserrate&#039;s strategies seems to be to depress the turnout of people specifically from this online community.<br /><br />Vote and encourage your friends and family to vote!&nbsp; It&#039;s exactly what Monserrate does not want you to do.&nbsp; A high turnout among community members who care about the community spells bad news for Hiram Monserrate.<br /><br />From my personal experience, here are two big reasons to vote for Moya.&nbsp; Moya has stood up for equal rights--a very big plus in my book.&nbsp; Also, Moya has always seemed very approachable and has listened to my concerns; I have never felt disrespected by him.&nbsp; (On the other hand, Monserrate showed utter disdain for constituents like me who went to Albany to meet him.&nbsp; I caught Monserrate coming from the gym when he was trying to avoid a scheduled meeting with me and others.)
