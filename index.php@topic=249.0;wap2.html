			Hello all. I live in the historic district and am currently teaching high school mathematics. I have been tutoring for over 20 years but have only once tutored someone in the neighborhood. I&#039;m looking to expand my clientile with neighborhood students. My rates are $45/lesson which lasts between 60-75 minutes. As I am not on the clock, there&#039;s no atmosphere of rush. <br /><br />I prepare for all standardized exams and am very much focused on communication with parents. If you are interested, please e-mail me at sgnmath1234@gmail.com
