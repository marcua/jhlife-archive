					Hello Jackson Heights Families!<br /><br />It&#039;s been a pleasure meeting many of you over the last three months. It&#039;s also<br />been very rewarding to see our little ones sing and/or dance along in class and<br />be able to recognize and respond to Spanish words and phrases. We have very<br />smart kids in this neighborhood!! Some news...<br /><br />JAPAN EARTHQUAKE &amp; TSUNAMI RELIEF<br />I am happy to share that thanks to EVERYONE who has attended my classes in both<br />Jackson Heights and LIC, in March I was able to donate $150 to the JCIE&#039;s<br />Earthquake Relief and Recovery Fund, for both emergency and long-term efforts in<br />Japan.<br /><br />SPECIAL MOTHER&#039;S DAY CLASS AT P.E.D.S.<br />***THIS MONDAY, MAY 9, IN CELEBRATION OF MOTHER&#039;S DAY: Come to a Monday class<br />and pay by donation! Give what you wish. Proceeds from this class will be<br />donated to the MARCH OF DIMES. (A fellow JH mom, Lisa Koss, has been critically<br />involved in this year&#039;s MARCH FOR BABIES fundraising campaign, having a personal<br />interest in seeing to it that expecting mothers receive early prevention<br />information to avoid unnecessary birth complications. I am happy to support her<br />efforts through my class.)<br /><br />SUMMER SESSION AT PEDS BEGINS MONDAY, JUNE 6<br />The Â¡Vamos a Cantar! 6- and 12-week summer session officially begins on Monday,<br />June 6. Register now - see the bottom of this e-mail for registration<br />instructions. In the meantime, we continue to meet on Monday mornings at 10 am<br />at PEDS. Please come and join us if you haven&#039;t tried a class out already. The<br />children have lots of fun and actually do learn Spanish in the process!<br /><br />TUESDAY AFTERNOONS AT MI-MI-FOR-ME YOGA STUDIO<br />Take your child to a $5 trial Â¡Vamos a Cantar! class at Mi-Mi&#039;s and see for<br />yourself how fun it can be to have a run of the sunny, spacious and<br />temperature-controlled yoga studio while singing, dancing and playing to beloved<br />Spanish children&#039;s songs. Makes for a nice cool summer afternoon. Call Mimi at<br />718.505.9642. <a href="http://www.mimiformeyoga.com/fall-Schedule.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.mimiformeyoga.com/fall-Schedule.html</a><br /><br />I hope to continue to see many of you throughout the summer, as well as meet<br />more of you soon.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Gail Montemayor (Annika&#039;s mom)<br />Owner &amp; Founder, Â¡Vamos a Cantar!

While living in Long Island City with her newborn, she<br />found a community of like-minded parents and continues to meet with them on a<br />weekly basis to teach songs, sing together, and foster a safe and loving<br />community for their babies. On average, Gail sings to about twenty-five babies a<br />week. Now back in Jackson Heights, she hopes to build a similar community for<br />her family here.
