			<strong>smadaJH</strong>:
			<br />
			I am looking to rent my apartment furnished with all utilities included on 82nd St and 35th Ave for $2,500 a month.&nbsp; <br />It is a 900 square foot, 1 bedroom apartment with a formal dining room. The apt is quiet located on the 4th floor, walk up, in the back of the building. I have pictures that I can share with you <br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you

			<br />
			$2500? I pay $1800 for the same thing and it&#039;s closer to the subway&nbsp; ;D

			<strong>sl</strong>:
			<br />
			$2500 for a 1 b/r apt is too much.
