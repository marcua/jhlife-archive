				NBC has a new Queens based comedy debuting this fall called Sunnyside.<br /><br />Sunnyside trailer:<br /><br />https://www.nbc.com/sunnyside/video/sunnyside-official-trailer/3953479<br /><br />https://www.nbc.com/sunnyside <br /><br /><em>About the Show<br /><br />Garrett Modi (Kal Penn) was living the American Dream. As the youngest New York City Councilman ever, he was rubbing elbows with the political elite, attending star-studded parties and was the pride of Queens. But instead of spending his time in office helping the people that got him elected, he lost his way amidst the power and glamour of politics. When his downward spiral got him busted for public intoxication (and downright stupidity), it was all caught on tape and ended his career. Now, Garrett&#039;s crashing with his sister Mallory and wondering where it all went wrong. That is, until he&#039;s hired by a diverse group of idealists who dream of becoming American citizens and believe he can help - giving him a new sense of purpose and a chance for redemption, as long as he remembers where he came from.</em>

				Interesting! Always fun to see familiar streets on TV.<br /><br />I wonder if the artists who made this Sunnyside mural were compensated, since it seems they&#039;ve adapted it to be the logo for the show. <br />https://sunnysidepost.com/sunnyside-mural-or-graffiti

				<strong>Sunnyside Post</strong>:<br /><br />NBC Provides New Details on “Sunnyside” Comedy Series, Premieres Sept. 26 (https://sunnysidepost.com/nbc-provides-new-details-on-sunnyside-comedy-series-premieres-sept-26)<br /><br /><em>The Sunnyside Post has learned new details about Kal Penn’s leading role in NBC’s upcoming comedy series, “Sunnyside,” scheduled to premiere Thursday, Sept. 26 at 9:30 p.m.<br /><br />The information – which was delivered to the Sunnyside Post by NBC – reveals that Penn will be portraying Garrett Modi, a disgraced former New York City Council Member who represented Sunnyside, Queens for more than 14 years.<br /><br />Modi, who was elected on the show in 2004, was on track to finish his fourth term in public office when he was arrested on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway for public intoxication and attempting to bribe an NYPD officer. The officer’s body and dashboard cameras recorded the incident on video, which was uploaded to YouTube where it then went viral.<br /><br />The upcoming pilot episode for “Sunnyside” picks up after the City Council had unanimously voted to remove Modi from power, and opens in his former office at City Hall where a newly-elected representative has started to move in.</em><br /><br /><strong>Follow above link for full article.</strong>

				I watched it. That&#039;s 1/2 hour of my life I will never get back. The only thing about Sunnyside was the name of the show and they briefly showed the Sunnyside sign.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a group of people complaining about their immigration status and how hard it was to obtain green cards/citizenship. <br /><br />I won&#039;t watch it again.

				&nbsp;I saw it and will keep watching hoping it gets better. The basic framework of redemption by the lead <br />who messes up his life in an immigrant family who are otherwise v.successful is offset by the good <br />work I hope he gets into with helping those hoping for citizenship. The wealthy Chinese kids are <br />horrible stereotypes and should be changed asap! The sister, the politician and a few of the <br />students have some depth as characters but they need to polish the others for more dimension <br />and accuracy.<br />&nbsp; There is footage of the neighborhood though and its great to see it, however fleeting...
