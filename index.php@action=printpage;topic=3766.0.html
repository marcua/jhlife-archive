				The &quot;Season Greetings&quot; decoration used to actually be CORRECT?! (according to these photos, it used to say &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings&quot;)<br /><br />http://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/queens/jacksonheights/82ndst/index.htm<br /><br />Also, I wonder why the 82nd Street lights haven&#039;t been lit. &nbsp;They&#039;re nothing spectacular, but it would be nice to see some twinkling lights! &nbsp;Are they broken?

				Haven&#039;t seen the lights on 82nd Street, but now I&#039;m wondering if they still have the Holiday music playing outdoors.&nbsp; They used to do that for years.

				Thankfully, there hasn&#039;t been any Christmas music along 82nd St., knock on wood. My apartment faces 82nd St. and listening to holiday music all day everyday for a month drives me crazy. It&#039;s always the same damn loop of songs over and over and over, ad nauseum. I question if it entices people to spend more money. Is it even legal to play music outside?
