					I&#039;ve been wondering why it is taking so long to fill up the retail spaces in the Roosevelt Ave./74th Street subway complex.&nbsp; <br /><br />From <a href="http://www.therealdeal.net" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The Real Deal</a> (hat tip <a href="http://www.nrvlowdown.com/nyc/queens/jackson_heights" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">NRV Lowdown</a>), here&#039;s an article that discusses the delays:<br /><a href="http://www.therealdeal.net/breaking_news/2007/10/22/1193093932.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.therealdeal.net/breaking_news/2007/10/22/1193093932.php</a><br /><br />Aside from the bad news about the delays, there&#039;s good news in the article that <a href="http://www.koryodang.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Koryodang CafÃ©</a> will rent the street-level retail space at 75th Street &amp; Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love their stores in Flushing and Manhattan, but the &quot;Koryodang Express&quot; near 72nd and Roosevelt just doesn&#039;t cut it for me.

					Several streets in Jackson Heights have received honorary names, a practice that is common throughout NYC.&nbsp; I often wonder who these people are.&nbsp; If you know about any of them, please tell us here!<br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s an article I found about <span class="bbc_u">Kalpana Chawla Way (74th Street, between 37rd Road and 37th Avenue)</span>....<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3889605.stm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3889605.stm</a><br /><br />BBC News<br />Tuesday, 13 July, 2004, 12:31 GMT 13:31 UK<br /><br />New York honours Indian astronaut<br />By Salim Rizvi<br /><br />Almost one and a half years after the tragic disaster of the Nasa space shuttle Columbia, one of its crew, the late Indian-American astronaut Kalpana Chawla has been honoured by the New York City administration.<br /><br />74th Street in the Jackson Heights area of the city has now been renamed 74 Street Kalpana Chawla Way.<br /><br />Kalpana Chawla was one of the seven astronauts killed when the Columbia shuttle disintegrated in mid-air on 1 February, 2003.<br /><br />The Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, officially unveiled the Kalpana Chawla Way on Sunday at a simple but well attended ceremony including hundreds of people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.<br /><br />&#039;Sacrificed her life&#039;<br /><br />The Jackson Heights area, also known as Little India, has a strong concentration of people of South Asian origin who strongly favoured the move to honour Chawla.<br /><br />The community has been trying for some time to get the street named after her.<br /><br />The president of Jackson Heights Merchants&#039; Association, Shiv Dass, who is of Indian origin, says that his organisation has been trying to get the street name changed since the death of Kalpana Chawla last year.<br /><br />They approached City Councilwoman Helen Sears, a Democrat, who got a bill passed to this effect.<br /><br />&quot;We are so proud to have the street named after our hero Kalpana Chawla, who sacrificed her life for this country. All of us from South Asia - Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis - we are all so happy to honour one of our own,&quot; Mr Dass said.<br /><br />This Jackson Heights area also serves as a major shopping centre for the South Asian community in New York and surrounding areas.<br /><br />It is a hub of commercial activity and also a major centre for regional cuisines from South Asia.<br /><br />Pioneering spirit<br /><br />Kalpana Chawla was a naturalised American citizen who lived in the Houston suburb of Texas state, about 10 miles (16km) from Johnson Space Center.<br /><br />She was born in the town of Karnal in the northern Indian state of Haryana, 75 miles (120km) from Delhi.<br /><br />After moving to the United States, she earned a master&#039;s degree and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering, and became a US citizen.<br /><br />In 1994, she was selected by Nasa for a rigorous one-year training programme to serve as a mission specialist on board shuttle missions.<br /><br />She said that that her inspiration to take up flying was JRD Tata, who flew the first mail flights in India.<br /><br />Before and after her death, Kalpana Chawla&#039;s fan base was not just restricted to the South Asian community of the United States.<br /><br />People from all walks of life remember the astronaut&#039;s warm smile and pioneering spirit.<br /><br />A life that ended so abruptly will now be remembered for generations to come every time they visit Jackson Heights.<br />

					<em>Posted with permission of the author...</em><br /><br />Shalom Chavarim!<br /><br />There are Jews in Jackson Heights!?&nbsp; YES! And some of have been talking for awhile about starting a chavurah right here!&nbsp; Soooo-- LET&#039;S DO IT!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">A chavurah or havurah (Hebrew: &quot;fellowship&quot;, plural chavuroth) is a small group of like-minded Jews who assemble for the purposes of facilitating Shabbat and holiday prayer services, sharing communal experiences such as lifecycle events, and Jewish learning. Chavuroth usually provide autonomous alternatives to established Jewish institutions and Jewish denominations.<br /><br />Most chavurot place an emphasis on egalitarianism in the broad sense (of which gender egalitarianism is one piece), depending on participation by (and welcoming of) the entire community rather than top-down direction by clergy.</span></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The above is a definition from Wikipedia--except for my addition of &quot;and welcoming of&quot;. MY definition of &quot;community&quot; includes ALL Jews, Interfaith families, Gay and Lesbian families, singles, all ages raging from pre-natal to most mature.<br /><br />The first meeting of The New Jackson Heights Chavurah will be:<br /><br />Friday, January 4, 2008 @ 7PM<br /><br />The place of our meeting will depend on the numbers of definite RSVPs I receive by December 1, 2007.<br /><br />We should have a committee involved in planning the service--so, anyone interested in doing this--let me know.&nbsp; It would be nice to have a mixture of experienced and novice individuals to provide a learning forum for those interested in expanding their knowledge of our liturgy.<br /><br />So--Please RSVP whether you are coming to the January Chavurah and if you want to be on the service planning committee--to <a href="mailto:adrucker@spamarrest.com" class="bbc_email">adrucker@spamarrest.com</a>.<br /><br />B&#039;Shalom-<br /><br />Abby Drucker<br /><br />

					Mayor Bloomberg has proposed a broad array of policies to help NYC accommodate the projected 9,000,000 residents by 2030 while also improving environmental sustainability and quality of life.<br /><br />See the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">PlaNYC</a> website for details of these proposals.<br /><br />The most controversial element in the plan is the proposal to charge vehicles a congestion toll in order to enter the Manhattan core -- or drive around within it -- between the hours of 6 am and 6 pm Monday through Friday.&nbsp; Under the initial proposal, the toll would be set at $8 for cars and $21 for trucks, with lower rates for traffic that doesn&#039;t enter or leave the zone.&nbsp; There are a lot of complex quirks: other bridge tolls would be reimbursable, certain classes of vehicles (including taxis) would be free, and the tolls would only apply if vehicles actually drive on Manhattan streets.&nbsp; In any case, a commission is currently studying the proposal and is due to announce its recommendations in early 2008.<br /><br />In the meantime, the city has published a &quot;Request for Expressions of Interest&quot; (RFEI), in which firms that may potentially bid on the contract to operate the Congestion Pricing Plan explain their overall options and proposals for how to make it work.&nbsp; The NYC Economic Development Commission has published online 21 of the 30 responses it received to the RFEI.&nbsp; These make fascinating reading if you&#039;re interested in the technical details of this stuff, and want to learn how other cities have made these types of systems work for them.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nycedc.com/Web/AVAILABLEPROJECTS/RFPsRFQsRFEIs/Congestion+Pricing+RFEI+Responses.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">The documents are available for free at the EDC website</a>, but first you need to jump through some hoops to get access to them (e.g. you need a non-Yahoo or Gmail email account).

But Officer Edward Sawtell, of the precinct&#039;s traffic division, said in the past month police have towed 20 cars marked for sale by six dealers from New Jersey. He said police have convinced four of the six not to come back.<br /><br />The dealers park the vehicles in areas of high pedestrian traffic. Unfortunately, that often equates to areas of high congestion, such as 82nd Street and Astoria Boulevard, 94th Street and 24th Avenue, 82nd Street and 35th Avenue, Junction Boulevard and 34th Avenue, 108th Street and 35th Avenue and on Northern Boulevard between 80th and 89th streets.<br /><br />&quot;Junction and 34th Avenue is a parking lot for Delaware [plates],&quot; Sawtell said.<br /><br />Local residents looking for parking places share the hassles of this arrangement with prospective car buyers. Sawtell said the dealers also advertise their vehicles in New Jersey newspapers. If a person agrees to buy the vehicle, he said, the dealer hands the buyer the keys and tells him the vehicle is in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Sawtell said the cars often are not insured and can incur any number of summonses due to parking violations or other issues- - all of which the buyer must pay before he can register the vehicle.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s buyer beware,&quot; he said. &quot;If you buy a car, check the VIN.&quot;<br /><br />Will Sweeney, co-founder of the anti-congestion civic group Western Jackson Heights Alliance, said he was glad the local precinct knew about the problem.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s good to know that they&#039;re going one step further and finding out who owns these cars,&quot; he said, noting one in four cars he passes during his morning exercise sport out-of-state license plates.<br /><br />But Sweeney said the cause of the problem is the lack of parking regulation in an area that has one of the lowest proportions of vehicle ownership anywhere in Queens. Census data from the year 2000 showed 38 percent of Jackson Heights residents owned cars, compared to 62 percent boroughwide.<br /><br />&quot;We should have some sort of way to put a value on-street parking,&quot; he said, suggesting an experimental residential parking permit program. &quot;There are people who just come and park their cars. It really becomes just car storage.<br /><br />Reach reporter Jeremy Walsh by e-mail at <a href="mailto:jwalsh@timesledger.com" class="bbc_email">jwalsh@timesledger.com</a> or by phone at 718-229-0300, Ext. 154.
