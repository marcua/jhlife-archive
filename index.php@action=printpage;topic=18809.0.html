				a building on 75th, just north of 37th Road, which houses (or housed) a lawyer&#039;s office on the ground floor. the owners have covered the first floor in large black tiles (or marble slabs) that resemble the restroom of a Russian nightclub in Brighton Beach. astounding.

				there are actually a few really lovely houses that remain unspoiled, but i&#039;d bet you could get support for eminent domain from our conservative posters -- it&#039;s a local emergency and we need a wall -- a pretty green wall! :)

				There&#039;s a guy who is documenting all the wackadoo architecture in Queens. Here&#039;s a story: https://hyperallergic.com/415081/all-the-queens-houses-photographic-survey/.<br /><br />I wish I had more of a sense of humor about it. Personally, ugly architecture just makes me depressed.
