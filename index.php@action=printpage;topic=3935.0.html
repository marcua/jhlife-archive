				You mean back when it had an actual one?&nbsp; With a handball court and basketball court.<br /><br />I recall going from 4trh grade at PS 69 because I got stung by a bee on first base in punchball ... first base was a garbage can.&nbsp; Those were the days.

				I used to play softball in the schoolyard even in the winter, we were hard core softball addicts. This was during the<br />mid 80&#039;s, eventually we moved on to Travers Park. On sunday mornings we would practice for a few hours, Nick who worked<br />for the Post office was like almost 70 yrs old(he would pitch) but the rest of us were in our teens to early 20&#039;s.<br /><br />It was a good sized yard to play softball in. We would alternate where home plate would be, sometimes on the 77th St<br />side and other times on the 78th St side, good times.

				When I was in high school, I had a buddy with the name, Ralph Pollock. He was a consummate gambler, and he insisted that much of his tuition money attending William &amp; Mary College came from his winnings in crap games behind the handball courts of the P.S. 69 schoolyard. Those years were between 1955-1960. Anyone know of the whereabouts of my fabulous friend, Ralph? We kept in touch over the years but like many from the past, we&#039;ve lost contact.

				In the late 50s I remember playing slapball on the 77th Street side of the handball courts before school started. Played puchball during recess. Played stickball every Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday&#039;s would also play softball on the 78th Street field with older guys when they needed players.<br />

				I played stickball there regularly in the 1960s on weekends as there were some great strike zones etched on the walls. Also played basketball after class in the the yards, Mr. Hartstein taught me the hook shot which somehow I can still do from a long distance out. I&#039;d occasionally play pick up softball games. I think we fungoed the balls.
