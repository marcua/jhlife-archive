				We should get on this bandwagon! (Sorry in advance if I am not inserting the link correctly. It&#039;s about a Washington Heights councilman introducing a bill that would reward commercial landlords for maintaining reasonable rent levels to protect small businesses.)<br /><br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130422/washington-heights/uptown-councilman-aims-keep-rents-low-for-small-businesses?

				thats an interesting solution (tax breaks to the landlords for keeping the rents lower)... <br />I&#039;m never a fan of subsidizing... I always think of when the US subsidized the cable boxes when everyone HAD to go digital. The boxes cost $60 with a govt rebate of $40. The boxes were very simple, they should have cost $15. As a result, the only winners were the companies who sold the boxes, who made $60 total from every single one. total muck.

				I have to agree with Jeff here that I&#039;d definitely prefer <strong><em>not</em></strong> to subsidize private, commercial landlords with my tax dollars. It would be easy enough to create a fair and balanced commercial real estate market in this city through proper tax legislation and zoning regulations, but unfortunately all of our politicians are in the pocket of NYC&#039;s real estate developers.

				&quot;Proper tax legislation&quot;, like what? <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure that a &quot;rebate&quot; is what they&#039;re talking about. What&#039;s keeping the rates high and stores empty? The fact that you can claim the $X lease fee (that is in line with all other commercial lease amounts being charged in the area, right? No single landlord is claiming that THEIR property is MORE valuable than someone else right next door and should be able to get twice or three times what they are charging) as a business loss if the storefront is empty. I&#039;m pretty sure the idea is to offer a tax incentive to the landlord. By way of example, let&#039;s say your postage stamp store leases for $10,000 a month. You keep it empty and claim the deduction as a business loss. SO the city says, if you only charge $5,000 to a business that fits these outlined (whatever they are decided to be) criteria, you will be allowed to continue to deduct that $5,000 difference as a loss. If they wanted to really encourage small business development, the amount available to deduct AND the lease collected could actually be higher than the original &quot;empty store&quot; deduction.<br />So it&#039;s not <strong><em>your</em></strong> tax money subsidizing anything. And if the landlords are using business losses in our neighborhood to offset profits made in other parts of the city or state, we aren&#039;t seeing any of THAT tax dollar anyway.
