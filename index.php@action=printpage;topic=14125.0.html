				Hello,<br />I&#039;m in contract for a 2br coop in Jackson Heights and wondering if anyone has a good recommendation for someone who can do a bathroom renovation--someone very affordable but who will do quality work. I don&#039;t need anything fancy, but new and pretty would be good. I also have a few months to hunt so I will probably contact a few. Everything else seems good about the apartment, except the bathroom is pretty awful!<br />Thank you.<br />Ann<br />

That may give you a sense of what&#039;s possible in your bathroom. Good luck!

				@jeannette, an espresso sink is going to look horrible in a bathroom like that. You can probably find a nice vintage one that matches better by looking at one of the salvage places: <br /><br />&nbsp;http://shop.bigreuse.org/collection/bath/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwlMXMBRC195OLzqOz04wBEiQAooa7CMnQHXWColQVP4LGkgr5IQzrBocLmAqbki3rXYUmUf0aAuN78P8HAQ<br /><br />So jealous of your colors!

				regarding your leaking faucet, I would ask a plumber&#039;s advice.&nbsp; You may just need new faucets which are easy for a plumber to replace.

				Your biggest cost for a bathroom reno may be plumbing.<br /><br />Your sink and toilet may operate perfectly but not be up to current code. That&#039;s often true of pre-war bathrooms that haven&#039;t been updated. So you may need extensive plumbing work. Before you select tile and vanities you want to get a full bid and scope of work from a few contractors.<br /><br />Btw, IMHO pedestal sinks look nice but are very impractical day-to-day. You lose under-cabinet storage with one, which is a big thing in most bathrooms. Plus they require more cleaning and upkeep. With a regular sink you just clean the bowl and the top. With a pedestal you have to clean the whole darn thing and the visible dust and dirt that accumulates on the sides and back. I had one. Never again.

				Thanks everyone! Keep your comments coming, please.<br /><br />This is helping me so much to think about something of which I know so little.<br /><br />Regarding the faucet, Super says it would cost a small fortune to get vintage parts in good shape, but I think he is also being influenced by the water reduction regulations.<br /><br />I would love to have a wall mount without a cabinet, but Super has nixed that idea as well saying the wall can&#039;t support it. But that is what I have now, so I don&#039;t quite understand.<br /><br />Has anyone replaced a 24&quot; sink with an 18&quot; vanity sink? Is 18 inches just too puny?&nbsp; I just feel that a 24&quot; cabinet will encroach on my space.<br />

				There are 20&quot; and 22&quot; vanity sinks as well. Just Google &quot;22&quot; vanity sink&quot; and click on images.<br /><br />You could also browse sites like Pinterest for bathroom sink ideas. I&#039;m pretty sure you have to sign up for a free account in order to browse. Once you have an account, you can save your ideas (images) there.

				Last evening I purchased a bathroom vanity sink. As I was paying for it, my HD salesperson said I should have hired a plumber who would have had or been able to access the obsolete parts to my 70-year-old bathroom sink. It would cost me about the same, and I would be keeping the original deep bowl and water pressure. <br /><br />Why didn&#039;t I think of that? I would much rather put my money in the pocket of a worker than HD. Can anyone recommend a plumber? The old &quot;need a plumber&quot; threads here don&#039;t yield much in recommendations.<br /><br />By the way, my super said it would be near impossible and very expensive to fix the old sink. Do you agree? <br /><br />
