				It looks like the Bagel Cafe on the corner of 86th and 37th is set to undergo a major renovation. At least it looks that way from the outside. It has green plywood barriers all around it. Maybe they will do something nice with the place!

				I buy their soup a lot in winter and have heard the owners talk repeatedly about turning the place into a Greek restaurant. They were waiting for permits for a long time. So looks like it&#039;s happening now! Their spinach pies are quite decent so here&#039;s hoping the new place will be a nice addition to the neighborhood.

				Looking forward to this. At one point they talked about going Italian, but looks now like they will go Greek.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m misremembering this, but if I recall there was also talk about sidewalk tables, which would be great.<br /><br />As suggested earlier, fundamental to keep up the breakfast bagel tradition :)

				I saw the sign went up for the new Greek place on 86 and 37 avenue called Jackson Gyro. It was originally the bagel store.&nbsp; I wonder if it will be sit down table service or just a take out place. Hoping for the best and glad it will be something else besides chicken.

				I managed to get a peek inside yesterday. There are a bunch of televisions along one of the walls, which is a bit of a turn off for me in terms of eating there as opposed to ordering take out. I really wish that the restaurants around here wouldn&#039;t go so bonkers with the TVs.

				Looks like a cross between a takeout place and a sit-down place--but it does not look exactly like a restaurant comparable to those in Astoria. It looks like the food is made behind the counter on a grill, as it is in some deli&#039;s that serve burgers and eggs. I sure hope the food is good and they deliver! Greek and similar cuisines are my #1 favorite and other than Plaka, which is kind of far away and not walkable, there is nothing like that in JH. I&#039;m happy this is here, but I still long for a real, full-service, sit-down Greek restaurant that serves wine and beer, etc. I hope they have fish on the menu, not just gyro/souvlaki.

				This looks like it&#039;s going to (hopefully) be a good lunch option in the 80s. One frustration I&#039;ve had is the lack of places to get a decent sandwich for lunch in the upper 80s. There are lots of places to get a BIG lunch if that&#039;s going to be the main meal of your day, but not that many places to get a smaller lunch (aligned with my particular cultural expectation of a mid-sized meal for the day).

				In terms of places for a small lunch in the 80s, I would also recommend the daily lunch special at Sac&#039;s. It&#039;s about ten bucks, and for that you get a nice salad, bread, and pasta as well as a soda. Admittedly it&#039;s not an ideal spot for a sit-down meal but it&#039;s really tasty homemade fare for that price.

				Great--I like the salad options and they will have some of the traditional dishes I love like lemon potatoes and egg/lemon soup. But zero fish on this menu!

				Had lunch here today.&nbsp; A bit disorganized and unfriendly--no greeting from owner or happy first day vibes.&nbsp; Still the gyro platter was copious (enough for two) and tasty.&nbsp; The lemon potatoes, however, lacked any lemon flavor and were lukewarm.&nbsp; Overall, a tremendous addition to the neighborhood. And the breakfast menu looks terrific. I wish them well.

				It would be wonderful to have a Greek restaurant that offers more fish options, but this place markets itself as a gyro restaurant, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s their aim (gyro/souvlaki places typically specialize in slow roasted style meat and devote their kitchen space to that, not fish). Fish doesn&#039;t have a long shelf life so you need robust demand to sustain it, and the meat options are more reliable lunch fare, which seems like what they&#039;re going for given the counter setup. That said, hopefully the calamari and octopus will sell enough to justify keeping them on the menu, and I&#039;m still looking forward to trying their other offerings! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=16691.msg83742.html#msg83742">Quote from: ljr on February 05, 2018, 04:59:58 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Great--I like the salad options and they will have some of the traditional dishes I love like lemon potatoes and egg/lemon soup.

				Went last night around 9pm.&nbsp; It was still pretty bustling.&nbsp; The staff couldn’t have been more friendly, welcoming and glad to go over the menu and make recommendations.&nbsp; We ordered grape leaves, a trio of spreads (faba beans, taramasalata and tzatziki) and then a gyro sampler platter for 4 (which could have fed 6 to 8 easily).&nbsp; Everything was delicious, freshly made and—I’ve spent a lot of time in Greece, I should point out—very true to what you’d get on a dinner table in Athens or Thessaloniki.&nbsp; The decor is modern, clean and unpretentious and they were playing a mix tape of Depeche Mode (not too loud) which somehow fit really well and was a nice surprise.&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn’t recommend this place more—they’re doing what they’re doing from the heart and from their heritage and it shows.&nbsp; I hope they do well.&nbsp;

				delivery guinea pigs here. and a definite thumbs up.<br /><br />order arrived promptly, with the cold elements separated from the hot -- a good sign right off the bat.<br /><br />our resident octopus fiend was bummed that they were out, but made do with the calamari which was deemed....not bad. agreed here, it was nothing special.<br /><br />the pikilia, however, was great. we got fava beans, tarama and kopanisti and they were all terrific, especially the fish roe, which was clearly homemade -- just the right blend of sea, salt and tang.<br /><br />we got the large platter, planning for tomorrow&#039;s lunch as a bonus, and the above poster was right about the portion -- great value for the price. chicken doner and gyro (my two go to choices) were tender and spiced well and the sausage was very, very good. would like one more of those and a little less gyro next time, but that&#039;s a minor quibble.<br /><br />side was lemon potatoes, which actually tasted of lemon.<br /><br />absolutely ordering again.

				I&#039;m Greek (not Greek American) so I feel I should contribute here, although I have only tried two sandwiches so far.<br /><br />I can highly recommend the pork doner, which is actually what gyro is in Greece, not the lamb/beef minced thing. Very tasty and not greasy as is often the case. Very filling and great value too. The chicken doner is good too, although not at the same level IMHO.<br /><br />As someone else already mentioned, Greek restaurants typically focus on meat or fish dishes, not both, although obviously they often do here to expand their clientele.<br /><br />I will definitely be back often.<br /><br />

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to read the kind reviews going on in this forum. We will eventually be serving wine and beer, we are just waiting on the community to approve our liquor license. <br /><br />We see there is a high demand for more fish items, but we want to make sure we serve quality food and it would not be fair to the community to make the commitment to serve more fish items if we cant guarantee the highest quality, which is why our main focus right now is meat.<br /><br />We are a cross between a take-out and a sit-down restaurant. Casual dining. We are working very hard to provide quality food and quality service for the community. <br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				Greek guy here.&nbsp; We tried this place the first week they were open.&nbsp; There were definitely some glitches (items on the menu weren&#039;t available, and it took a long time for our meal to be served - and I do mean a long time), but nothing that can&#039;t be ironed out over the next few weeks.&nbsp; We were told that many of the items would be in stock in the future, and what we did eat (the gyro platter) was really good.&nbsp; For sure, I&#039;ll be back, although more towards the end of February so that the staff and the back office have the chance to get more familiar with the menu, clientele and demand.<br /><br />And on a side note, really glad to have a new gyro place in the neighborhood.&nbsp; That will cut down on my trips to Astoria when I get the craving (although nothing can beat mom&#039;s food, so for that, I&#039;ll gladly go to Astoria).

				dss, I genuinely would like to know if restaurants typically wash lettuce. Especially now that I know it is required by the DOH! I don&#039;t think they generally do, have never seen any evidence of it though some may buy pre-washed greens.<br /><br />sorry if I hit a nerve. I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re trying to get at with your clean dish equivalency. Pizza parlors often serve slices straight onto trays that I also question have been properly washed.

A wet salad dilutes the dressing. That&#039;s why for the home market, salad spinners are popular.<br /><br />Yes, restaurants wash lettuce and other fruits and vegetables. If you&#039;ve ever washed your own lettuce, you know there can be dirt and bugs in a head of lettuce (and lots of sand in spinach and bok choy.). So if restaurants weren&#039;t washing lettuce, you&#039;d encounter dirt, sand, and flies with frequency. It wouldn&#039;t make sense for most restaurants to use pre-washed salad because there&#039;s a premium charged for that convenience, restaurants operate on pretty tight margins, use a lot of lettuce for salads, sandwiches, garnishes, etc., and prep cook is a pretty low paying job.<br /><br />Prep work is typically not done during service, and is normally done where customers can&#039;t see it, even at a restaurant with an open kitchen, so that&#039;s why you&#039;ve never seen a restaurant employee washing lettuce. Neither have I as a customer, but I&#039;ve seen loads of lettuce be washed or done it myself as a food service worker. <br />

				Don&#039;t underestimate the power of the restaurant grading system. They were closed by the Dept of Health for a couple of days and never got past a grade pending again.&nbsp; It seems to me that all their business stopped when that grade pending sign went up. I never understood why they didn&#039;t do whatever they needed to to get the A back. It&#039;s too bad. There food was good and a well-needed change in the hood.

				the grading system definitely has an impact on the habits of some consumers. but it&#039;s interesting, you say &quot;the food was good,&quot; and you probably ate there when the violations were in place (after all, the inspection that closed the place came when the &quot;A&quot; rating was in the window).&nbsp;

				^I recall when the shut down occurred I looked up what the violations were. Mostly it seemed to be the result of oversights from the renovation that had recently occurred. (There was one about flies, and yeah, sure that&#039;s not great, but it was also in the summer when flies are omnipresent.)<br /><br />Who knows, maybe the whole point of the renovation was to sell the business.

				They we’re never graded an A. Never made it past the grade pending.&nbsp; Also, on the last inspection there was no one there with a food handlers license. That’s a big mistake, and it says a lot about&nbsp; the lack of care.

				Jackson Gyro never served A+ food, IMO. It was always cheap and meh. Breakfasts were awful there. There didn&#039;t seem to be much going on everytime I walked past either. People in this neighborhood keep opening up restaurants thinking they&#039;re going to succeed but without the business skills to make it happen.<br /><br />One place that I think is doing well right now is Cafe de Colombia. They have good food (their croissants are ALWAYS fresh, and warm sometimes, too!) AND it&#039;s super cute and cozy inside. Can we just have more of these instead of the basic restaurant layouts?

				The greek sausage was good, as was the pork and chicken doner and falafel. It was reliable greek breakfast/lunch, with other nice menu choices (smoked salmon on a bagel). There were one or two misses though on the menu (the gyro hash for example, but I knew that was a flyer when I ordered it). I never monitored the lunch/breakfast crowd too much even though I walk by that corner most days, but I never thought it unusually sparse for the time of day (including when I went in to eat there).<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to see it go. I hope the owners just decided they wanted to sell to relax and enjoy the good life. We have a lot of meat heavy restaurants in the upper 80s, so having options where the lunch isn&#039;t a big hunk of meat is nice. (Popped in to Papa&#039;s Kitchen recently for just this reason.)
