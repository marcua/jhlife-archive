				Wondering how people in our neighborhood are channeling their civic energy since there are 0 competitive races on our ballot (though voting is still very important!) <br />On this election eve, there are a lot of great candidates out there who need volunteers to phonebank to get out the vote. Have you &quot;adopted&quot; a campaign in another district for donations and/or phonebanking?<br />I&#039;ll go first: been making calls for the Texas Dems and, closer to home, Jackie Gordon who&#039;s running for Congress in the 2nd district on Long Island.

				&nbsp;It&#039;s time to go back to the original stuff of getting to know the voters. Showing up at local events, getting to know people, knocking on doors, going to houses of worship, soccer games and finding out people&#039;s names. The polling bs is unreliable and that the &quot;social desirability bias&quot; was used again to deflect the pollsters means we have to rethink this. Have fun rallies and give stuff away would be one post-pandemic thing. Endless calls and texts have not proven to be helpful in winning elections, they just aren&#039;t making it happen.

				absolutely true, itsit. i see AOC and Jessica Ramos around at places like the Farmers&#039; Market all the time, meeting and mingling in a non-moderated setting. same with Danny Dromm. their predecessors didn&#039;t do that. Joe Crowley was very good at holding town hall events, but he didn&#039;t spend much time in the district. and as far as John Sabini/Helen Sears? they may as well have lived in Virginia alongside Crowley

				<strong>how does this scale? </strong><br /><br />you can have 1-on-1 in local races, but statewide and above, meeting the voters isn&#039;t effective compared to the hate being pumped out by media, &quot;traditional&quot; and not. <br /><br />there&#039;s all kinds of stuff about winning hearts and minds by showing 1-on-1 empathy - which is effective!, but in the time 5 people can convince 10 others that progressive ideas are human,&nbsp; 5 people online can get 2,000 people sucked into QAnon.....<br /><br />to quote a friend...&quot; humans aren&#039;t evolved to handle the internet. It allows a whole class of new thing, infectious mental illness, to be spread without direct contact, simply over text and images. You can adopt your own community of lies and there will never be any evidence to prove you are wrong&quot;

No but there is that thing called &quot;buzz&quot; and then word of mouth which can be very effective. Also personal stories and op-ed type pieces that spread another way. IG is terrific with stories as people leave Facebook. So it can start with the one-on-one contact and grow in a number of ways successfully, I believe.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
