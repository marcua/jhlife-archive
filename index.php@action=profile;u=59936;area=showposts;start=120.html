					And... He&#039;s back. The charges were reduced to a class A misdemeanor, apparently with time served. Why the judge would drop the charge from a Class D felony to something with a 30 day sentence, especially given his previous record, is beyond me.

					The police where able to arrest him after a neighbor who witnessed the incident saw him near 82nd Street and flagged down a patrol car. He&#039;s now at the Vernon C. Bain Center and has a court date scheduled for July 8th. I&#039;m pretty sure that he is related to the owner of the house since they share the same last name according to the ACRIS records.<br /><br />Webcrims shows that he was arrested on similar charges in August of 2015. The court kept postponing his sentencing hearing for some reason (he was released on his own recognizance). He also has charges for violating a restraining order, harassment, and destruction of private property.<br /><br />We&#039;ve been trying to find out if it is possible for a group of us to send a letter to the prosecutor explaining that he has created a serious quality of life issue on the block..

					So this guy is back at it. I haven&#039;t seen him in about a week and then last night he was yelling at one of my neighbors. This morning he got in some guy&#039;s face. Someone called the police, they come, he goes inside, they leave. Later on he gets into it with one of the people working on my building. He crossed the street, and I couldn&#039;t see what was going on because of a tree that disrupts my view. He went into the back yard of his house, came back to the front with a pick axe, and told the worker that he was going to put it through his head. My neighbor calls the police, he goes inside when he sees them coming, they leave.<br />

					I&#039;m not sure if it is his property given that it is zoned as a 2-4 family, but yes; he is generally drunk and disorderly within the confines of the property. He does, however, venture off the property to swing at people with his cane, tell off the super of my building, threaten my neighbor, etc.<br /><br />This afternoon he yelled that he was going to bust a cap in my ass (or something to that effect) and said something similar to my neighbor, so his threats are now escalating. I don&#039;t know if he is armed.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking up people associated with the house and there is one person, in the same age group, who has been charged with violating a restraining order, criminal trespass, contempt for not showing up for a court date, assault, and some other misdemeanors (WebCrims is an interesting site). I don&#039;t know if it is the same person but the charges are consistent with his behavior. He has court dates on July 11 and July 14.

					Yes, he lives in a house across the street from my building. It is zoned as a 2-4 family. The area where he likes to sit is too large to be considered a stoop but to small to be a veranda (plus it isn&#039;t covered), so I referred to it as a porch.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t menacing be an arrestable offense or does someone need to be injured? At any rate, the block as a whole is concerned and I know that several people have made complaints to the 115th. Hopefully something can be done before someone is seriously injured.

					About a month and a half ago some basket case turned up on the porch across the street from my building. He&#039;s usually angry and drunk by 9:00 AM (often earlier), shouts obscenities at people as they walk by, got into my super&#039;s face because he didn&#039;t like his t-shirt, screams that this is his block, makes threats to people as they walk by, made threats against my neighbor&#039;s sister, and attacked two people with his cane two days in a row (not sure why he has a cane, given that he is in his 30s and seems to walk fine). He usually disappears for a few hours in the afternoon/evening but is usually back on the porch by 9PM. The good thing is that he usually fall down drunk by then and can&#039;t hurt anyone. <br /><br />The police have been called several times but he just goes into the house and doesn&#039;t answer the door but comes out after they leave. The first time he attacked someone the police talked to him and someone in the house a couple of doors down but didn&#039;t make an arrest for whatever reason.<br /><br />This guy is clearly not right and something needs to be done before he decides to get stabby or shooty. The police seemingly can&#039;t do anything. My building&#039;s board has been going through security tapes but has yet to find anything useful. I&#039;ve been trying to find some social services office that might be able to help with this but keep hitting dead ends. Anyone have any ideas?

					I came across this on my Facebook feed and thought it might be of interest to some on this board. I&#039;ve been a long time lurker on this site and it seems that the rising commercial rents in Jackson Heights have been a running concern. I&#039;m not sure what this petition can do but I suppose it&#039;s worth a shot. Terrazza 7 is a great place to have in the community and it would be a shame for it to be gone.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/787/828/533/save-terraza-7/?taf_id=23603033&amp;cid=fb_na" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/787/828/533/save-terraza-7/?taf_id=23603033&amp;cid=fb_na</a>
