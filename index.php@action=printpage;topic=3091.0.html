				HI All- I am posting this because I need help finding a home for Remby, a six year old Apricot Standard Poodle. <br />(he is on the small side).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I was supposed to care for Remby temporarily while his family was away. I took him in with the understanding that I would be returning him to his original owner (he has been with me for approximately 6 -7 months).&nbsp; However, I have just been informed that his previous owner will not be able to take him back, that she is sorry and that I should go ahead and do whatever I think is right for Remby.<br /><br />It pains me that I am unable to keep him for longer than I already have,&nbsp; I already have two small dogs and two kids in a one bedroom apartment and three dogs is a lot of work not including the constant bathing and cleaning so that the place does not smell of dog. <br /><br />Remby is a GREAT and LOVING DOG. He thinks of himself as a lap dog and constantly wants sit on my lap or be carried. He gets so happy and excited to see me when I get home.&nbsp; He loves to play fetch and knows a few tricks. He is very smart and pretty much obedient (although he has his moments, he can benefit from someone that will be willing to work with him and train him more) . Remby is a very energetic dog. He likes to run outdoors and take long walks.&nbsp; He loves to chase his dog friends in the yard and play catch with them. He loves to sneak up on his friends and start games of gotcha.&nbsp; He would make a great companion for any family&nbsp; <br /><br />The ideal family for Remby would be a family with one or two adults, or one with older children. Remby needs to be in a family where he is â€œthe babyâ€ since he always wants all the attention and makes it a point to let you know this.&nbsp; He will push my other pets out of the way if they are getting cuddles or treats because he thinks that HE COMES FIRST. (yes, I am applying human emotions to a dog).&nbsp; He spent his puppy years with one owner, who treated him like a baby â€“ carried him everywhere, babied him like an only child â€“ all attention was paid to him, and him alone. Because of this, he has difficulty dealing with a larger family, where he wouldnâ€™t be getting the attention he is used to â€“ as is the case in my household.&nbsp; Remby is fixed and is a very healthy dog.<br />&nbsp;<br />I would be doing Remby an injustice if I did not tell you about his bad side.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I have been trying to find a NO KILL shelter for Remby because I refuse to drop him off and leave him at the ASPCA. I could not live with myself if I did that to him. I have emailed several shelters, but have not heard back from them. I am sure with the economy being what it is they are getting hammered with calls.&nbsp; I want him to go to a good reliable family that will love him unconditionally and will be able to&nbsp; give him plenty of time as he LOVES being in the center of it all.&nbsp; Remby needs a family that will appreciate him, love him and enjoy him to the fullest and give him a FOREVER home.<br />&nbsp;<br />Please help me find him a home<br /><br /><br /><br />

				gosh, i wish you luck. my building does not allow dogs, or i would happily pitch in. here&#039;s hoping for happiness for remby.<br /><br />p.s. have you thought about placing a notice on a board like the one at espresso 77 (though i am not certain if that&#039;s the proper venue -- i know the owners check in here and might say yea or nay)

				You might also try a poodle rescue group - this one says they serve NJ &amp; NY - and they usually carefully screen applicants to make sure all will be well. <br />http://www.watchungmtnpoodleclub.org/id2.html (http://www.watchungmtnpoodleclub.org/id2.html)

				Thank you all for your help.<br /><br />I will look into the poodle rescue site.&nbsp; I called several but they wanted to foster him. I do not want him fostered. I think that he was traumatized enough when his owner left him. I want him to have a steady home and I really want to screen the person that he goes to as well. I want him to have a happy home.&nbsp; He is such a great dog and really deserves it.&nbsp; I had a few friends over this weekend and they all wanted to take him home...unfortunately, they are not allowed pets. <br /><br />If any of you hear of anyone that will make a good parent, please let me know...<br /><br />Thank you all again!<br /><br />Cee

				Hi Arlinda,<br /><br />So far no biters. I am thinking that right now it is hard for people to take on the extra cost of a dog.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks for the offer to help. I really appreaciate it... I am going to get him groomed this weekend...hopefully that will make him even MORE attractive...<br /><br />Someone from this site actually had made plans to meet and take Remby...then they just disapeared and are now unreachable. :-( Their loss, Remby is a good catch.

				I am glad to inform that Remby was adopted and is now in a very good happy home.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you all for your help. <br /><br />Should you ever be looking to adopt or foster a dog please contact Waggytail Rescue:&nbsp; waggytailrescue@gmail.com<br />They were very helpful and truly cared about where Remby was placed. <br /><br />Thank you all again.
