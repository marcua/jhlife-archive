				A year or so ago I started a thread on Chowhound about markets in Jackson Heights. You can see it here: http://www.chowhound.com/topics/359692. Now that JH Life is going strong, I would love to continue the conversation here. So...what are your favorite food markets and shops in (and around) the neighborhood?<br /><br />Jenna

				Trade Fair has a very impressive selection of olive oils - not only the front display as you enter, but each ethnic aisle seems to have even more bottles.<br /><br />They also carry good, organic produce towards the back - mache, arugula, etc.

				One great thing about this neighborhood is the seemingly endless supply of places to try buying food and groceries.&nbsp; Since this topic is way too big for me to think about, I am just going to start with one category: fruit and vegetables.<br /><br />I am increasingly pretty happy with the fruit and vegetables I get from the Met.&nbsp; Not so happy at Trade Fair, and I don&#039;t seem to enjoy shopping for produce at Patel Bros or Apna.&nbsp; I frequently go to Fruitel Farm on 78th but I am not always that pleased with the quality.&nbsp; The other fruit store a few doors down closer to Met seems to be approximately the same.<br /><br />Further down towards where I live (80&#039;s) occasionally I see what look like some really good deals on fresh things from I believe it&#039;s called Kim&#039;s around 80th St.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tight squeeze, but when things look good from first glance, it seems worthwhile to get things there.&nbsp; Also there&#039;s a high turnover which is always good for produce.&nbsp; Further along 37th, the quality diminishes with the next place - don&#039;t know the name of it (could be around 81st) but it has high wooden shelves in the back with other cookies and cereal, etc.&nbsp; And the quality sinks miserably low as you get to the fruit place between 84th and 85th.<br /><br />One time I got the crispiest grapes ever at the Korean-owned convenience store on Roosevelt and I think 85th or maybe it&#039;s 84th (it&#039;s where the triangle of streets comes together).&nbsp; Another time I went back and the fruit looked as droopy as ever.<br /><br />In terms of the Asian places, I like Chonghap fairly well (though it has an odd smell. . .) and the produce is pretty good there.&nbsp; I never go to the Pacific Market any more after having bought some chicken there that smelled bad when I got home.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t remember the produce being too interesting or fresh looking.<br /><br />Living in the 80&#039;s, I am almost as close to the Hong Kong Market in Elmhurst as I am to Chonghap, so sometimes I walk (15 minutes) there.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have the highest quailty fruit in the world, but the vegetables were extremely fresh.<br /><br />And one time I took a trip over to Astoria after reading Astorians and chowhound to see where to get good produce, and I bought a head of lettuce that was&nbsp; still crispy after a few weeks - maybe a month (clearly I&#039;m not eating enough salad if the lettuce lasted me a month).&nbsp; I think that place was Elliniki or it was the place nearby to that one.<br /><br />And oddly enough, after swearing I would never ever buy produce again from a Trader Joes after the one i went to in Massachusetts kept selling me produce that was close to expired, I have found that the produce at the TJs in Queens is actually pretty good.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve gone far and wide in search of good and reasonably priced groceries (the organic place in Forest Hills, the Stop and Shop on Northern, Waldbaums in the 70ths in East Elmhurst, Western Beef and&nbsp; Pathmark in Astoria/LIC. . .but this post seems long enough).

				Met Foods continues to up their game -- they&#039;ve been adding new products all over the place -- they just added three different lines of Greek yogurt, leaving Trade Fair behind (though I love the guy who runs the dairy aisle at Trade Fair -- he&#039;s such a nice guy). And they&#039;ve improved the meat dept again. It&#039;s still not the best supermarket in the world but it&#039;s improved quite a bit from what it offered three years ago.

				My partner and I moved to JH from Seattle about seven weeks ago, and I can attest to the fact that the biggest change for us, overall, has been resourcing foodstuffs in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Very different from the West Coast, I can tell you....&nbsp; and that&#039;s a good thing.<br /><br />West Coast grocery stores are huge - and slick - and really &#039;done up&#039; in terms of display and accommodations.&nbsp; Of course, those costs are paid for by the customer.&nbsp; That being said, <em>I cannot believe how much cheaper groceries are here in JH!!</em><br /><br />The benchmark I use most is lemons.&nbsp; Seattle, lemons are <strong><em>$1.00-1.10 EACH.</em></strong>&nbsp; At Met, large lemons are 3 for $2.00.&nbsp; My newest and most staggering discovery is Growing Farm, directly across from Met.&nbsp; Gadzooks, the produce in there is impeccable!&nbsp; And lemons, while not all squeaky-clean-and-perfect, are <strong><em>3 for $1.00.</em></strong>&nbsp; In my book, that rocks.&nbsp; Growing Farm constantly stocks really good, very fresh herbs at $1.00 for a decent package, too.<br /><br />Yeah, Trade Fair is pretty claustrophobic.&nbsp; I like Met better overall.&nbsp; For Christmas Dinner I bought a 7.3-pound chicken for $9.43.&nbsp; In Seattle, first of all, you would <em>never, ever</em> find a chicken of that size.&nbsp; 3.5-4 pounds, max.&nbsp; A 4-pound chicken would cost probably $7.00-8.00, anyway.<br /><br />I spent a year at Seattle Culinary Academy, so food is a passion of mine.&nbsp; I have been really, really happy to locate good produce at Growing Farm, great seafood at Pacific Supermarket, good red meat at both Trade Fair and Met, good poultry at Met, and pretty good dairy at Met.

				It&#039;s on 37th at, I think, 84th? It&#039;s a nice shop -- has a lot of products you can&#039;t find elsewhere in the neighborhood. It is a drop pricey (and even pricier than the health food store I used to shop when I lived on the Upper East Side, but it&#039;s convenient, the people who own it and work there are incredibly nice, and if you need something they don&#039;t stock, let them know and they&#039;ll try to order it).

				They expanded nearly a year ago. It was much smaller, and didn&#039;t carry produce. Good selection of non-dairy items as well. Also the sales staff are very caring, I left a package there once, and they woman remembered I had forgotten it. I went in a few days later and she gave me the items that I had purchased.

				David -&nbsp; Met Food (75th st./37th ave) also carries Muir Glen tomato products - they are not with the other canned tomatoes, but in the natural/organic section at the end of the baking + plastic wrap aisle. There&#039;s also a selection of various flours (Bob&#039;s Red Mill), oils, whole wheat pastas, canned soups, jams, etc. most of which are organic.

				I recall new management taking over several months. Also noticed slight changes in products. Went there yesterday, it seems they were cleaning and re-arranging some of the aisles. I also noticed different and more variety. It seems that they&#039;re trying to keep up with the trend set by Met and Trade Fair, however, falling short at the moment. Looks like they&#039;re planning on a hot foods case and have already seen rotesserie chicken while waiting on line. I wish they would first concentrate on getting fresher produce. They had some fruit and vegtable salads that look pathetic. I think the idea was to make they look attractive, but, blah not when they look like they should be dumped.

				Where do you go to buy boneless chicken breasts?&nbsp; <br /><br />I was in Met today and didn&#039;t get them because they seemed overpriced at almost $5 a pound.&nbsp; (or is this s normal price?) Ended up with the thighs instead, but just threw them away a few minutes ago because I thought they smelled funny.&nbsp; This is not the first time I&#039;ve posted about things smelling funny, so maybe I am oversensitive or paranoid.&nbsp; Though sometimes it seems prudent to be paranoid about chicken in particular.<br /><br />Is Trade Fair good with chicken?

				Shelby, Fairway has great deals on boneless chicken breast frequently.&nbsp; I&#039;ve purchased them for $1.99 lb.&nbsp; Yes, it&#039;s usually the family pack, but it&#039;s so easy to separate into smaller packs before freezing.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ve mentioned previously that you shop Fairway, so next time you go there, check the chicken.&nbsp; It&#039;s always fresh.&nbsp; You can also download their online weekly circular prior to going so you can get a heads up on sale items before making the trip.<br /><br />http://www.fairwaymarket.com/Specials/index.cfm?Area=Specials<br /><br />Re:&nbsp; Met Food -- Most of my experiences with meat/chicken have been good.&nbsp; Bread is a completely different story.&nbsp; Unless I bring my reading glasses, I can&#039;t feel confident that whatever packaged bread I purchase at Met is going to be fresh.&nbsp; They&#039;re pretty bad about stocking outdated bread, so I&#039;ve started buying bread elsewhere.

				I went to Berry Fresh Farms today based on Buddy&#039;s directions and it was a breeze to get there. &nbsp;Unfortunately I forgot to ask the quickest way back and it took me about 5 times as long to get home (lots of traffic lights and even some construction) as it did to get there. &nbsp;I took Steinway to 31st Ave to get home.<br /><br />I did have a very pleasant experience in Berry Fresh. &nbsp;It&#039;s well laid out and clean and has good choices in things like yogurt and bulk nuts and cheese. &nbsp;I bought some decent salmon from the fish counter though found that it wasn&#039;t as tasty as the piece I got last from Hong Kong market in Elmhurst. &nbsp; I wasn&#039;t all that impressed with the produce. &nbsp;To me it looked less fresh than what I usually see at the produce place across from the Met. &nbsp;The apples and some of the citrus looked kind of sad.<br /><br />Since it&#039;s out of the way and takes some time to get there and back, I probably won&#039;t make the trek over there again (unless I can figure out a fast route home). &nbsp;But it is certainly very pleasant and lovely over on Ditmars Blvd. and it would be great if we had a little shopping center like that one.

				I really don&#039;t like any of the super markets in JH.&nbsp; Trade Fair is decent but the aisles are too tight.&nbsp; Met Food is horrible,&nbsp; &nbsp;the place literally stinks.&nbsp; I opt for Stop and Shop by 48th Street and Northern.&nbsp; The best butcher in JH is Don Francisco on 85th street and 37th Ave.&nbsp; (It&#039;s right across C-town)<br />Don Francisco makes a home made Argentine Condiment (Chimichurri).&nbsp; Excellent for BBQ on beef, chicken and pork.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Joining this discussion late!<br /><br />I&#039;m also increasingly impressed with the quality of the produce at Met Food on 37th.&nbsp; Met Food on Northern is another story all together.&nbsp; But I buy most of my produce almost daily at the little Korean grocery across the street and up a little from Met Food.<br /><br />A word about Met.&nbsp; Avoid the cashier [name edited by moderators for privacy reasons] at all costs.&nbsp; Every time I have been in her line, it has literally ruined my day.&nbsp; The last time the baby was fussy, so I went to the check out long before I was done shopping.&nbsp; The line took forever.&nbsp; I bought $30 worth of stuff.. and most of the bulk was gallon bottles of water.&nbsp; From the time that she handed me the reciept (after a really really slow check out process) to the time she managed to waddle over to the boxes in her high heels waddle back and scowl and slowly slowly slowly and painfully lift each item and put the $30 worth of stuff into two small boxes...it took 12 minutes.&nbsp; TWELVE MINUTES!!!!&nbsp; To put about 20 items in two boxes!!!!&nbsp; While I held a screaming baby in my arms.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that generally the staff who put things in boxes don&#039;t work with her.&nbsp; I think she has po&#039;d most of the staff who work there... as well as the customers.&nbsp; Over a year ago I had a similar problem... without the baby, and complained to the manager.&nbsp; Another time she forgot to tell anyone that she had a delivery, and it took 3 1/2 hours for my stuff to arrive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes she has blond hair and sometimes black.&nbsp; Sometimes permed, sometimes straight.&nbsp; Young and pretty is all she&#039;s got going for her.&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; And a really nice collection of high heels.&nbsp;

				For such a diverse community,&nbsp; I too think that the Met food store on 37th Avenue is pretty good offering a a good variety.&nbsp; However, I consider all the cashiers to be [edited] soooooooooooo so slow.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that even with people packing for them that it takes an extraordinary amount of time to check out.&nbsp; I find most of the cashiers quite irksome.&nbsp; Sometimes they&#039;re eating or talking on the phone as they ring you up.&nbsp; It gets me crazy.&nbsp; Oh, and what&#039;s up with all the plastic bags they give you.&nbsp; You buy dog food, that gets placed in its&#039; own plastic bag.&nbsp; You buy detergent, that gets placed in its&#039; own plastic bag.&nbsp; By the time I&#039;m finished, I have about 5 or 6 plastic bags all put into.....you guessed it.....a DOUBLE PLASTIC BAG!!!!!!

				Thought I&#039;d share this piece.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/archives/2008/05/new_yorks_best.php<br /><br />What they didn&#039;t mention is that Patel Brothers started out in a tiny one-room storefront on the other side of 74th Street, and grew into a thriving business that dominates the block, and is constantly bustling with activity.&nbsp; <br /><br />The majority of storefronts in our neighborhood represent a family&#039;s dream to run a business.&nbsp; The hours are long, and there is the risk of losing everything.&nbsp; And sometimes, a family&#039;s dream becomes a neighborhood icon, like Patel Brothers.&nbsp;

				So today I went to the grocery store called Compare Foods on Northern Blvd between 86th and 87th - mainly just to check out the fish counter that Griswold Girl mentioned in another thread.<br /><br />I have to say they have totally transformed the place!&nbsp; The fish market is quite nice, but also there are new products including a large organic products section that includes boxed and canned items (I didn&#039;t notice if there is organic produce - I don&#039;t think so).&nbsp; I did notice some packaged organic chicken sausage and a small upscale meat area.<br /><br />The shelves have been re-designed so that they look nicer.&nbsp; It used to be a kind of depressing place and now I think it&#039;s quite a bit nicer than the other grocery stores around.<br /><br />As for prices, I didn&#039;t do much comparison shopping but the fish was very reasonably priced.&nbsp; However, the organic oats that I usually buy at Trader Joe&#039;s for $2.99 were a whopping $3.99 here.&nbsp; The Activia yogurt was on sale so that was cheaper than the usual Met Food/C Town price but I&#039;m not sure what the non-sale price was.<br /><br />Apparently there is another branch of this store on 85th and Roosevelt that has gone through a similar transformation.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been there but someone has reviewed it on yelp.<br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/compare-food-jackson-heights-2<br /><br />

				Anyone try the new seafood store on Northern, around 83rd I think?&nbsp; Called Red Lobster: I wonder if that&#039;s a copyright infringement!&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been in yet, but my husband stopped by and said that some stuff looked good/some not so much - but got some nice shellfish there for New Year&#039;s Eve.&nbsp; We even ate the oysters raw and no one got sick . . . I&#039;m pretty sure the oysters were from there - I know he also got some stuff at the seafood counter in Super Compare (what used to be Popular on Northern but is about 200 times better).&nbsp; The seafood counter inside Super Compare also seems to have pretty varied quality, but at least with these options, there&#039;s some possibility of getting fish without trekking to Corona or Astoria!

				&nbsp; &nbsp; I love the Food Bazaar on Junction and 34th Ave.&nbsp; The produce section is incredible and the butcher has a wonderful selection of pork and sausages.&nbsp; I am amazed at the selection of food items here.&nbsp; Give it a try you will not be disappointed.

				Contessa:&nbsp; Are you familiar with Casa Rivera at 40-15 82nd Street?&nbsp; I just discovered this incredible store a few weeks ago and I have been a regular.&nbsp; Its a very busy store with a section for seafood, meats, grocery and deli.&nbsp; In the back of the store is a restaurant with seating (no table service).&nbsp; Two soups each day plus 3 entrees.&nbsp; I take the food home for dinner.&nbsp; Very reasonable prices.&nbsp; Casa Rivera specializes in Columbian, Peruvian &amp; Mexican.&nbsp;

				&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the tip Mike V I don&#039;t get over to that side of the tracks too often but I will definitely make a trip this week.&nbsp; I&#039;ve giving up cooking professionally but continue to cook for the ones I love and having a grocery store which carries a variety of international spices, produce and meats is a must.&nbsp; What type of prepared foods do they have?
