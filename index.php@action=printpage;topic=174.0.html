				A couple of nights ago, I had the need to call a cab service for a drive into midtown Manhattan.&nbsp; As is customary for the service that I&#039;ve been using, the driver arrived promptly and the car was well maintained.<br /><br />During the ride, the driver, a South American immigrant, began a political discussion on how he was disillusioned with life in general in the U.S.&nbsp; His primary complaint seemed to be the arrival of so many folks from Manhattan occupying affordable housing in his neighborhood.&nbsp; He explained that a few of his driver colleagues felt the same way and that one actually was being harassed by a landlord to vacate so he may rent to a &quot;gringo&quot;.&nbsp; These were his exact words.&nbsp; &nbsp;He seems to have a lot of resentment for the way that Jackson Heights has changed over the last few years.&nbsp; He went on to say that he no longer feels like this is his neighborhood or that he belongs.&nbsp; This guys says he works 2 jobs daily, and even so does not get to enjoy the fruits of his labor because of increasing costs in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Overall, I says he feels he&#039;s being pushed out.<br /><br />Being an immigrant myself, I was pretty much left speechless, as my circumstances seem to be better than his.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				&quot;That&#039;s Life&quot; - Is the most polite way I can say it.<br /><br />Neighorhoods, along with civilizations, empires, countries, even the stars, are born, go through a period of maturation, decline, and eventually die.&nbsp; The only constant in life is change.&nbsp; <br /><br />People like to bring up these false arguments against gentrification, as if it&#039;s better that a neighborhood remained &quot;authentic&quot; and mired in poverty, rather than &quot;outsiders&quot; (99% of the time this is a code word for &quot;whites&quot;, &quot;gringos&quot;, &quot;gabachos&quot;, &quot;crackers&quot;, &quot;honkies&quot;, whatever the current term used in the Third World Studies Department at UC Berkeley to disparage those of European background) come in and the neighborhood shows signs of improvement.<br /><br />People also seem to forget that neighborhoods in the New York City area are in a constant state of flux.&nbsp; What about the neighborhood known today as Harlem?&nbsp; Of course we all know the Indians were there first.&nbsp; If there&#039;s anyone who has a legitimate &quot;beef&quot; with gentrification, it starts and ends with the Indians who were indeed &quot;here first&quot;!&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Wikipedia, Harlem was named by the Dutch after the city in Holland known as Haarlem (two A&#039;s), back in the 1600&#039;s.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Dutch were eventually displaced by the English.&nbsp; Fast forward to the early 1900&#039;s, and Wikipedia continues noting the arrival of East European Jews, which reached a peak of 150,000 in 1917.&nbsp; Jews were eventually displaced with the arrival of Blacks in large numbers from the South.&nbsp; And, in the past 10-20 years, Harlem is still going through changes, with whites returning to buy brownstones/buildings, even our &quot;first black president&quot; Bill Clinton has an office in Harlem.&nbsp; Starbuck&#039;s, Ben and Jerry&#039;s, Magic Johnson Cinemas, Gap, etc. etc. all have stores in the Harlem neighborhood now.&nbsp; Walk through Harlem and you&#039;ll also see signs of other recent new comers from Mexico, Central America, west Africans, etc. etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />What about the Washington Heights neighborhood?&nbsp; Present day it&#039;s an area of mainly Dominican immigrants, but Alan Greenspan (former chairman of the Federal Reserve), and Ruth Westheimer (&quot;Dr. Ruth&quot; the &quot;sex&quot; doctor), lived there in their youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The point here is that neighborhoods change.&nbsp; What would your driver propose should be done?&nbsp; Have government step in and force everyone to live in areas designated by social class?&nbsp; By race?&nbsp; By income?&nbsp; Would he expect government to curtail our freedoms in order to prevent &quot;gringos&quot; from moving to Jackson Heights and &quot;raising the cost of everything&quot;?&nbsp; Remember also, that things go both ways.&nbsp; Just as gentrification is a real phenomena, neighborhoods also go through periods of decline.&nbsp; &quot;Slumification&quot;, &quot;white flight&quot;, etc. etc., those are real phenomena just the same.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot, I&#039;m not supposed to bring up that, I should have paid attention to those Marxist classes I was forced to take as electives in college!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, for the most part, my personal opinion is that &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot; (polite euphemism for &quot;whites&quot;) are for the most part buying co-ops in Jackson Heights, rather than renting.&nbsp; People buying co-ops generally have little impact on the rental market for apartments, these are 2 different market segments.&nbsp; Additionally, &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot; is a pretty broad, general term.&nbsp; Most of the &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot;, or &quot;whites&quot; if we want to be blunt, in my co-op building are retirees, immigrants from eastern Europe, widowers, people of fairly modest means.&nbsp; In fact, 3 of the &quot;folks from Manhattan&quot;, including myself, are married to persons of non-European origins!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, if your driver is being &quot;muscled&quot; by his landlord doing something illegal to get him out of his apartment, there are plenty of organizations and city agencies able to intercede on his behalf, if he&#039;s willing to do the research.&nbsp; But blaming the &quot;gringos&quot; isn&#039;t going to help him or anyone else. <br /><br />The other alternative is for the United States to set up a system like North Korea, where there is no freedom of movement, or any type of freedom, but at least everyone is pretty much equal.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think even your driver is willing to drive down that road!<br />

				Wow Prester, my ride was much too short to go into such diatribe with the driver, and being that he was in control of the driver&#039;s seat, I was not about to say &quot;that&#039;s life&quot;.<br /><br />I did lend my ears though, as he clearly needed to vent and seemed not interested in my viewpoints.&nbsp; Overall, an interesting cab ride with a different perspective on things in Jackson Heights/Queens.

				I&#039;m not actually sure that being married to someone of non-European descent, as I am also, makes you/us any more enlightened than anyone else. <br /><br />I&#039;m white, I&#039;m the definition of a gentrifier, I just moved to Jackson Heights and I DO feel a little guilty that I&#039;m probably contributing to the slow disintegration of a neighborhood from a middle class latino neighborhood to a whiter, wealthier one. But I don&#039;t think being aware of the reality, acknowledging it, and trying to lessen its negative impact on individuals is a bad thing. It&#039;s one thing to claim (correctly) that neighborhoods change. It&#039;s another to decry a person&#039;s individual hardship as somehow inauthentic.

				This neighborhood was not always a low-income and heavily latino populated. Neighborhoods will always change, perhaps a little faster in New York than most places. <br /><br />But where do the low-income people go? The poor just keep getted pushed further and further from Manhattan. The world needs cabbies and dish washers too.

				Interesting how NYC&#039;s penchant for creating nicknames for neighborhoods hasn&#039;t spilled over into creating nicknames for social classes.<br /><br />It seems &quot;white&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot; are shorthand for &quot;educated professional&quot;.<br /><br />Though I am an educated professional, I&#039;m not white, don&#039;t make a lot of money (work in non-profit), and am not moving here from Manhattan.<br /><br />Is there a name for whatever it is that I am?&nbsp; = )<br />
