					What do you think about this problem:<br /><br />There&#039;s a sick person in my building and they get picked up daily for treatments, I guess, and then dropped off. In the meantime, the ambulance is left idling, sometimes (like this morning) for up to 40 minutes, twice a day. This has been going on for at least since spring. <br /><br />I really feel for my neighbor and I understand all their suffering and difficulties that come from being seriously ill. However, is it necessary for the ambulance to be left idling for sooooo looooong twice a day, even when there&#039;s no one in it? <br /><br />It&#039;s noisy as hell, I can&#039;t get much work done, and I&#039;m breathing burned gases because it parks right under my window. <br /><br />What can I do to resolve this situation? Do I have any recourse at all? <br /><br />How about delivery trucks that are left idling while they unload? <br /><br />THanks a bunch!

					My car was broken into while it was parked on 84th Street between 37th and 35th Aves. Nothing was taken (except a cheap anti-radar cobra) because there was nothing to take. <br /><br />But here is what got to me: at least one resident of the building the car was parked in front of heard when it happened at around 1am on Friday. No call was placed to 911, not even as the criminals broke into another car parked down the block. <br /><br />In the morning, the other carâ€™s owner called the cops; yet, they ignored my car, which was parked 15 yards away. <br /><br />I didnâ€™t get to the car until last night. At least 4 residents passed by the broken window for two days, wondering why the car was still left open, and yet, no one called the police. <br /><br />When we called the cops, the officer didnâ€™t even want to write up a report: â€œwe are too busy to do anything about it, and Iâ€™ve got 3 other break-ins to write-up this evening,â€ he told us. â€œThis is a high-crime area.â€ <br /><br />This nonchalance is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention completely irreconcilable with their zeal when it comes to writing tickets. <br /><br />Prevention is obviously not a high priority (judging by the fact that Detective Johnson, the head of the crime prevention unit at our precinct, has yet to return a request for meeting placed a year ago), replaced instead by the assurance that there will be no punishment for criminals, because this is a high-crime area. Are we all not complicit in sending the message that no one gives a crap about what happens? Is this not the broken windows situation by definition that should have compelled people on so many levels to act? <br /><br />It&#039;s up to us whether JH becomes Bed-Stuy, with break-ins, muggings, rapes and murders, or a desirable living area. <br /><br />

					OK so we often have passers-by sit on our stoop - I can see why they&#039;d want to -- it&#039;s nice, clean and surrounded by flowers. Most of the time, we are nice enough not to remind them that they are trespassing but simply to remind them to pick up their trash afterwards. <br /><br />However, they often leave it there and it&#039;s our super who&#039;s gotta clean it.

					On my way home this evening, I noticed an eviction notice on El Punto del Sabor on 37th Ave between 84th and 85th. It was dated 8/4 and since the plaintiff was the landlord, I assume it&#039;s for non-payment of rent.<br /><br />Frankly, I am hoping this place closes down. Our building has been having problems with their garbage forever: for one, they never clean the sidewalk after their garbage leaks (which is daily), so now it stinks and the sidewalk is disgusting. Then, this past winter they had fallen behind on paying their waste management company so garbage collecting was interrupted -- during which period they STORED their trash in the back! They are just totally incompetent and really not a good neighbor. <br /><br />Have you seen any other businesses closing down (or being evicted) lately in the neighborhood? <br /><br /><br /><br />

					Hi, I live in a building right off of 37th Ave. Lately, the Chinese restaurant on the block has been putting off its garbage containers not on 37th Ave but on 85th Street, right next to my building. The containers leak chronically and the sanitation people are so careless they always -- EVERY night without exaggeration -- spill half of the garbage while they drag it to their truck. <br /><br />The smell has been horrid, and the spillage makes the sidewalk completely disgusting. I have called 311 numerous times and filed complaints about the restaurant and about the sanitation people. To no avail -- the only action they took was to issue a ticket to the corner store, because it&#039;s closest to the spillage, although the garbage is clearly not theirs. (The incompetence of the NYC bureaucracy continues to surprise me daily...) <br /><br />What other steps can I take? Should I write a letter to the restaurant? Who do I call? <br /><br />Any insight is appreciated, this situation is unbearable! <br /><br />Thanks!

					What&#039;s the right way to dispose of construction garbage? I&#039;m about to reno the kitchen and would need to throw out the old cabinets and appliances. Where/when/how is that done? <br /><br />Thanks a bunch! <br /><br />Also, can anyone recommend some inexpensive demolition guys? Thanks!

					Hi all, I&#039;m about to begin a kitchen renovation and I&#039;ll need a plaster/skim coat guy. Many of you have recommended Cesar, and I&#039;d like to call him and see if he can do the walls and ceiling in my kitchen and how much he&#039;d charge. <br /><br />Problem is, my Spanish is a little rusty. Would anyone consider calling him on my behalf? I&#039;ll be eternally grateful! <br /><br />

					I&#039;m wondering if there are many buildings in the neighborhood that have decided, some time in the 1990s, to ban the use of dishwashers or washing machines. Mine has done that, but when I bought my apt in 2003, the previous owner was still using an old washing machine. <br /><br />So I&#039;m wondering if the argument that old piping is not appropriate for dishwashers/washing machines is actually true. Has that been an issue somewhere?<br /><br />Do you know of any building around here that has updated their plumbing system to fix that? <br /><br />I know that there are more than one old buildings in the neighborhood that allow DWs and WMs, and I&#039;m wondering what&#039;s different about their piping. <br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />
