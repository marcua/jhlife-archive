					<br />Everything sounds good on paper. Reality is another story. Before anything becomes &quot;permanent&quot; there needs to be a complete and unbiased study and then a trail run. <br /><br />I can see it now - of course the 34th Avenue Mall supporters will want the westbound lane closed to add onto Travers. That means 35th Avenue becomes eastbound. The Q49 will have to run on both avenues. You could say the bus on both avenues might better service the neighborhood. It also means they will turn onto 75th Street to continue the route to Roosevelt. <br /><br />The 35th / 75th intersection has been dumped on enough:<br /><br />1) The change of direction to southbound, thanks to the Travers extension, and creating a 24 hour highway of noise and pollution.<br />2) The Q47 was rerouted up 35th and onto 75th to accommodate the 73rd congestion, and giving us Diversity Plaza. Really this <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; only served the Desi community. No one else uses Diversity Plaza. And if they had enforced traffic flow on 73rd and 37th none <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; of this would have happened. Maybe there should be no parking or standing on 73rd and 74th between Roosevelt and 37th <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; except for late night.<br />3) 73rd traffic that can&#039;t move southbound overflows now onto 75th<br /><br />Don&#039;t add more havoc to an area that has already been compromised in order to accommodate everyone else!<br />Limit the days or hours of 34th closure if not abandon the idea altogether. It just doesn&#039;t get enough usage to warrant being closed while agitating everyone else on 35th and 37th.<br />

					<br />For sure the closing of traffic on 34th Avenue has created more on 37th and 35th, <em>especially on 35th<em></em></em> since the chances of any movement there are better than 37th. <br /><br />Take a look at my name. My building stands on 35th from 75th to 76th. I did agree with the closing of 78th to add onto Travers Park. It did make sense. You know what we got? They turned 75th from northbound to southbound as a trade off. Now 75th is a southbound highway. What was a nice <em>quiet<em></em></em> residential street is now a 24 access for every truck, bus, siren and boom box car, not to mention other traffic with it&#039;s noise and pollution. Now it&#039;s 35th Avenue as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately the boundary line of the historic district officially stops right before my intersection. If you are not in the district no one hears anything. Meanwhile everyone on 34th smiles.... no traffic on a street that doesn&#039;t get enough use to warrant the closure. While people keep up &quot;quality of life&quot; issues such as this they really mean their own, not yours. <br /><br />And I can say having the new 34th Avenue Mall recently meant a perfect place for people to congregate and gawk at the 89 Street fire. That brought enterprising food and beverage carts for the gawking convenience. Recreational entertainment? Maybe we should ask about Port-O-Sans on every 34 Avenue corner to also accommodate the Mall. <br /><br />The bottom line is that as long as there is apathy concerning the district lines ultimately the whole neighborhood suffers. We keep seeing all the issues that the district rails against encroaching further and further. Other parts of 35th are in the district - do they not agree?

					There is also another route that you can take if you prefer to stay closer to home. I found this site and was able to assist a neighbor to get registered. Within a couple of hours a local appointment was obtained. I believe Epicenter gets word on any cancelled local appointments and then assigns them for you.<br /><br />Go to this website: Epicenter-NYC Vaccine Request

					I would like to volunteer as a vaccinator. <br /><br />The objective is to safely get this vaccine to as many as possible as quickly as possible; especially in our neighborhood. NYS DOH seems to only want people with at least some minimal connection to the health field. That is not me.<br /><br />It seems to me that diabetics everywhere are trained to self inject their own meds. Is there any reason why someone like me can&#039;t also be trained and supervised? It&#039;s not brain surgery and this is a war to save lives. I would even be willing to bring it to our shut in neighbors. I&#039;m sure everyone reading this is now having some litigious thoughts. But I would like to see our medical professional&#039;s time freed up to do more important things. And the only compensation I want is a smile and to keep seeing all of your good advice and your complaints here.&nbsp; <img src="Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" />&nbsp; <img src="Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />

					From all the stories that I have heard it seems that if the Jackson Heights Grand Dames didn&#039;t get on the M32 bus and head for 5th Avenue, they did their shopping at Clark&#039;s. They had an upscale selection of clothing, accessories and costume jewelry for women. The other popular destination in the neighborhood was up the block. On 37th Avenue the block from 81st to 82nd street, north side, was the site of Field&#039;s department store, also fairly well-to-do in it&#039;s day. It&#039;s now the site of the Renaissance School. I&#039;m glad you have your great aunt&#039;s dress. And congratulations on your 35th anniversary.

					Thanks Lilybell.<br /><br />I am fine and better prepared if I should ever (hopefully not) have to face this again. I hope this thread has made others aware of all that I learned going through this experience. I&#039;m sorry you had yours. Sometimes I think that this Covid economy tempts people into things that they might not normally try. That&#039;s sad.<br /><br />As this story unfolds a clearer picture of that night is coming into focus. I&#039;m just not permitted to say things publicly till all concerned have done their part and wrapped things up. Either way it still should not have occurred and in the end I&#039;m the one that has to live with it.

Just make sure you ring the doorbell. LOL <br /><br />I&#039;m told the law says that perp has to be all the way in your place and a threat before you can use the bat or pan. Otherwise you can be held liable for assault. Others have said grab the creep, drag him in and then he&#039;s yours. Your word against his. Something like pepper spray is a good way to disarm first and then clobber him if need be. That&#039;s called legally defending your home and self.

					I can tell you this - you can&#039;t predict a reaction, not even your own. Things happen in split seconds with no time to intellectualize them. As soon as I realized what was happening there was an immediate flood of adrenaline. My first reaction was to stop what was happening. I was not going to be a victim. I was not going to cooperate or flee. Luckily becoming scary worked for me. Had things escalated I don&#039;t know what my adrenaline might have done. Hopefully I will never have to find out.

					Overall an interesting article, nicely presented. As always though one needs to be careful when you see things either in print or on the internet as to it&#039;s accuracy. The author states that the Latino presence in JH begins in the 1950&#039;s with Colombians and other South Americans. Someone might want to challenge me but I believe the Latino presence began in the &#039;60s with Cubans running from Castro. This was shortly followed by a wave of Argentinians. The Colombians for the most part didn&#039;t arrive until the 70&#039;s, and then followed by other Latinos.

					I took care of my census on line as soon as I received the first notice. After that comes more mail, door knockers and phone calls telling me to do what I have already done. I know others who have the same experience. I seem to remember similar things last time around too. I believe it is important to cooperate. However, if they can&#039;t get their act together then how many times are people being counted and recounted and possibly counted again? <br /><br />Also there is the issue of undocumented people here in JH. It seems that some needed medical help with Covid but would not go to the hospital for fear of being caught. No matter what assurances they are given about anonymity they will not do it. Add that to general overcrowding in SROs and hidden basement rooms. <br /><br />My point is good luck with an accurate count. It&#039;s likely not going to happen.

					It seems you really know what you are talking about. And if you have had this same kind of experience then you&#039;s also understand how I feel.
