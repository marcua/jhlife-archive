				Here&#039;s the listing. <br />http://streeteasy.com/sale/1135735-townhouse-34-32-86-street-jackson-heights <br /><br />Looks nice from the listing pictures. They are saying it&#039;s 4,000 sq feet. On a price psf basis, it works out to $373.75 which is in-line with sales in JH.

				Hi everybody,<br /><br />I pulled up the last quarterly tax bill on the house, it was $1,908.24 so it was $7,632.96 last year. The 2015 assessments looked a bit higher, but should be under 8k still annually. This property has been on the market since July of 2014 looks like... <br /><br />

				&nbsp;PR56..... Your post comes across as almost angry in its tone.&nbsp; I&#039;m not too sure why.

The drive way is shared and most houses around there have fireplaces, dining rooms and separate garages. I repeat: You can find detached houses with own driveway, separate garage, fireplaces and dining rooms at the same or lower price point at Kew Gardens and Forest hills which are less crowded, dozens of coop windows are not&nbsp; overlooking your windows and yard, faster commute to the city (E,F instead of 7) and better schools. It is as simple as that but you, the seller, and the realtor can not or do not want to see the obvious.<br /><br />By mentioning the high prices of williamsburg and park slope you reveal the mindset of the seller/realtor. To a williamsburg/park slope transplant this house offers a lot. But you underestimate said transplants who will compare the neighborhood with kew gardens, forest hills, rego park...

My initial search found that the house was on Market on July 2014 as mentioned by the agent armen and by the date of first post of the other thread about this property.<br /><br />The agent for the house was not honest on the square feet of the house. As poster pr56 said, 4000 sq feet is only for the lot, the building area is about 2600 sq feet from my initial search (i&#039;m not sure if the basement was counted in this number).&nbsp; <br /><br />As mentioned in the other thread, the price for this home is definitely over priced, but whether the house can be sold at this price really depends on how long the agent is able to find a sucker from Brooklyn or one of your favorite overpriced neighborhoods.

				<br />It&#039;s simple, this house isn&#039;t selling because the sellers won&#039;t drop the price. And maybe they don&#039;t care because they&#039;re not in any rush, or pressure to move.<br /><br />Remember, our little &#039;hood has low inventory on homes &amp; coops, therfore, things usually go quickly,&nbsp; escpecially since we have become a &#039;hot&#039; real estate area of Western Queens :D

				73rd St between 37th Ave and Broadway also used to have a number of nice, large houses that have been turned into low-quality apartment and retail buildings. The latest just opened, with yet another grocery store...a Mannan grocery across the street from another Mannan grocery! The apt building across the street is only a few years older, but already has rusting metal railing on the outside.&nbsp; This house will probably meet the same fate...
