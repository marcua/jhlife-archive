					by:Anthony J Trimboli- If anybody notices an advertisement in any local police precinct concerning that you are required to report a lost or stolen cell phone with NYC Crimestoppers, the advertisement is fake and a lost or stolen cell phone should not be reported to NYC Police Crimestoppers because it is not related to a felony.<br /><br />The advertisement says that cell phone robberies are high on the NYC Subways and if you think, know, or even suspect that your cell phone is lost or stolen, you have the additional option of reporting it to NYC Crimestoppers. You do not. It is a felony and not related and should not be reported to the NYC Crimestoppers office.<br /><br />The information on the advertisement is fake and not correct concerning any large extent of cell phone robberies on the NYC Subways(it was found at the 75th Precinct in Brooklyn in East New York)and how now even if you think you lost your cell phone, you can report it to Crimestoppers. You may not.<br /><br />The info in this ad is fake. I know the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn had this advertisement hanging on the walls. Maybe other precincts around the local area do too.<br /><br />Again, you can not report any lost or stolen cell phones to NYC Crimestoppers or 1-800-577-TIPS. It is not the right number and the 75th Precinct had an ad inside of it that had false information on it.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- This is technically not your community, but I saw a first today on the 46 St Station on the R and V Trains around your community. I usually ride on the A and C Train around where I live and the stations are falling apart horribly. Horribly on the A and C Line. I sometimes take the R and V Trains home and these stations are well maintained including lots of them up there on the 7 Train. There must have been some sort of rust or pipe problem on th 46 Street Station today in Queens, New York with all that water on the ground!!! It was like the station was dripping horribly all day long from the outside pipes outside. This really was a first with the trains here on the R and V Lines--I know the A and C Lines near me can really be horrifying when it comes to having badly maintained stations, but the stations usually on the R and V Lines are usually well maintained. I notified Slattery Plz station when I got off. Wow. I never saw that type of leak before like I saw today with so much water on the ground like the R and V Line&#039;s 46 St Sta today. Again, this is slightly out of your area, but it may be of interest to you.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Does anybody notice how in your community and other communities of yours like Astoria like St. John&#039;s Prep is such a hard school to get to?? I live in Howard Beach and almost all the schools are easy to get to. Astoria and parking is bad, mostly bad. Astoria and traffic is worse. When I went to school at a Montessori in Elmhurst, New York, the director had all the students from the Queens location take the test for high school up at St. John&#039;s Prep. It was like the only way to get up there was by car!!!! I never saw a catholic school so hard to get to than St. John&#039;s Prep. With all the traffic and parking congestion, etc. I was a young person at that time, 12 at 1992 and I could not believe how hard it was to get there. I now am older and take trains and buses back then my parents mostly took me around and I could not believe how hard it was to get to St. John&#039;s Prep. Honestly. It was like, honestly, taking a trip to the moon or something!!!! I never saw a school so oddly placed for Queens as St. John&#039;s Prep--maybe it would be better as a school for people of Manhattan and the Bronx by the Triboro Bridge there.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- One good part of the areas like Jackson Heights, Sunnyside, and Astoria and a little bit of Woodside is that they have everything right there for you in terms of subways and restaurants and supermarkets. I thought Jackson Heights and Astoria led the others in terms of everything being around and right there, but I think Sunnyside is not that bad also. Some neighborhoods you have here in New York City, especially Manhattan(funny enough) and even parts of Long Island and Howard Beach, New York require you to walk like fifteen miles to get to a store. Look at certain areas of Astoria, for example. Look at certain areas of Jackson Heights and even areas sort of around you like Forest Hills and Elmhurst, all is right there. You won&#039;t believe how many areas, even Manhattan and some towns out on Long Island that have absolutely positively nothing around and you have to travel like many miles to get to the location. I think this is another good element of areas like Jackson Heights and OTHERS around it. All is right there, in more ways than one, like the NYC Suwbays.

When I used to volunteer at an organization on Spring St and 6 Avenue around there before currently working for a paper, there is a Van Dam Diner on Van Dam Street in SoHo, Manhattan. I am familiar with the Van Dam Diner in Long Island City and Woodside since it is sort of one of the big diners in the area like the Sage and like the Georgia. I never knew there was another Van Dam Diner in SoHo, Manhattan. They are not the same owners. I believe I asked that question and they are not the same owners. I never knew there was one in Manhattan.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- What do you all in Jackson Heights think of the new 7 Trains that New York City Transit put on the lines??? I think they are better when it comes to seating. Where I live, you have the disguisting A Train, which I can not stand and they have both types of trains where you have the small box seats where you sit in one seat and the bench like seating where there is a row where you sit and you all sit together like you are on a bench or something like that. I think I like the new 7 Trains because they help the customer in terms of seating. You have the box seating now on these trains that are also used on lines like the 1 and 9 and used to be on the 4 and 5 like that. I think there is a better choice and selection of seats on the trains now. But, however, I think standing room went down, the train seems more congested in terms of standing room. This is just my thoughts. The A Train seems to now favor the bench seating and it is harder to find seats, they have trains like they have on the L Train or M Train on the A Train now, it is a disguisting way to ride. I do not like the A Train compared to other lines around you like the R or the V or the 7 for many reasons, but the seating has gotten bad on the A Train.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- One interesting part of Jackson Heights is that it has such an interesting selection of houses and apartments inside of it. If you travel down Broadway, you will see only businesses the same applies to Roosevelt Avenue, for example. But, if you start going down some of the back streets, you start to see apartments and houses. I never saw that before in my life. I know Sunnyside has lots of apartments, but apartments only. Another area that may mix apartments and houses is Woodside, I think. I never saw such a large selection of houses and apartments as I see in Jackson Heights. It has such a diverse selection of all types of homes. I was thinking since East Elmhurst is north of you, maybe the homes there are sort of a carry over to the mostly residential East Elmhurst north of you, but maybe not. But, it really has a diverse selection of houses inside of it, being Jackson Heights.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- If you have ever seen the intersection of Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue, you will see how ridiculous the intersection is to cross even with a car. Because of congestion on Broadway both ways and Roosevelt Avenue being congested and the pedestrians, it is one heck of a hard intersection to cross. I crossed that intersection by both car and by foot and almost got into an accident all times I crossed it. I think this is because of all the traffic on Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway and the pedestrians all around. This is one dangerous intersection though.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I can not believe how diverse restaurants can be in Jackson Heights, New York. You walk down the street there and see so many restaurants around. You may think all of them are like Spanish restaurants but you are wrong if you think that. Some are, but some have the most interesting of food. I find that to be interesting since Jackson Heights is like Hispanic mostly, I believe. It has like Dominican and Ecuadorians, etc. If you go to areas like Richmond Hill, New York, you will see an area which has only Indian restaurants. This is common because it is an Indian community, but Jackson Heights has more of a selection of restaurants and so does areas like Astoria and Sunnyside, I was thinking Astoria more. When I was there in Jackson Heights once, I was expecting only spanish food around the area, but it turns out it had restaurants from all around. Even areas like Corona have like only spanish food inside of them. Elmhurst is more diverse and so is Rego Park, but so is Forest Hills. I can not believe how diverse lots of the restaurants can be in Jackson Heights. It is unique. Some areas like Richmond Hill and Corona really have just the food for themselves. This area has a diversity of restaurants.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli Likes Western Queens and Brooklyn- What do you think of the bus service in Western Queens areas like Jackson Heights, Astoria, Sunnyside, and even areas like the East side of Manhattan across the bay??? Hah. That is some pretty good service by MTA Bus. Where I live, in Howard Beach, the service has improved a little since the MTA took it over, but it is still the same type of service. Today, I was riding on MTA Bus, the Q11 and as if Howard Beach and some other areas are full of electrical wires down, the bus today had an electrical wire that was down in the back of the bus. It was sort of blocking the back door. According to FDNY Office of Inspection, electrical wires in strange spots should be reported to 311, 911, or perhaps who is in charge of them. A bus on the Q 11 went out of service today because I reported the electrical wire slightly blocking the back door on the bus. Besides that, you have buses which were mostly Triboro Coach and Queens Surface up there. You should see how impressive these buses are. You see them almost everywhere around these areas including Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side across the bay. Wow. In some areas, the bus service is no good. You go out to Eastern Queens like Douglaston and Bayside and you have long waits for the bus to come, the area is a little bit like a farm a commercialzied farm and that continues all the way down Northern Blvd to Centereach to a certain degree and you have LONG waits for buses out there!!!!! I can not believe how well the bus service is over in certain areas like yours and Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side. Wow. Very good service. If you talk about Long Island Bus, it is a bad wait and so are some buses East on Northern Blvd. Those areas out there are after Flushing, New York heading East are mostly commercial straight until Centereach to a degree, so there may be more people taking cars out there, but the bus service in some areas can be bad compared to how it is in Astoria, Jackson Heights, and even across the bay on the East Side.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli New Member likes Western Queens- Have you heard of a group in Jackson Heights called the Jackson Heights Beautification Group?? I really liked reading it. You have so many areas here around New York City today that are like commercialized areas and are commercialized areas that are like sort of filthy in some way, look at these electrical wires that you see that are cut improperly. Today, an MTA Bus I was on went out of service when I reported an electric wire over the back door that was not cut properly and the driver took it out of service up in Elmhurst. FDNY says that they are not there to pick up electrical wires, but if they are in the road or street or blocking you off, or perhaps live(most are not, funny enough), the people should call FDNY, according to the Office of Fire Investigation of FDNY. Besides that, I like the Jackson Heights Beautification Group because I think it is something which is there to create a positive look to areas like Jackson Heights. I like areas in Queens like Astoria, my own community, being Howard Beach(to a degree), Sunnyside, and yours. They are nice areas to live that appeal to me. I really like how you have a beautification group in Jackson Heights. It is something a little bit different, Queens can be commercialized especially down Northern Boulevard EAST past Flushing, you have commercial areas out there that extend all the way out to Centereach!!!!! I like Brooklyn, New York and Western Queens because it is not all about the commercialization thing. This group really shows that.&nbsp; I mean if you head east on Northern Blvd, you have commercial establishments after Flushing that go straight through to Centereach on Northern Blvd here!!!! At least Brooklyn and Western Queens has a break from that; Howard Beach can too a little.
