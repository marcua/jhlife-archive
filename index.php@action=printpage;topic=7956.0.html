				Sunday December 16th 2012 2pm-4pm <br />Ages 7-10<br />$40 per child<br />RSVP by December 11, 2012<br /><br />Live In Vision is about fun, connection, self-awareness and growth. This two-hour workshop allows your child to explore personal power and increase his/her self-esteem. <br /><br />Guided by Abigail Wilber, your child will take an imaginative journey through seven aspects of personal power (commitment, discipline, support system, inner guidance, love, lightness, and finding your own truth) and cultivate a healthy relationship with each one. &nbsp;The workshop will include the importance of self-love and the meaning and value of each childâ€™s life. &nbsp;By engaging in creative and fun activities this will help create an additional foundation for a healthy childhood. <br /><br />This program helps your child:<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain confidence in all areas of personal power. <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to set and achieve goals with ease and joy.<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilize the tools for a growth mindset (A growth mindset allows a child to seek out learning opportunities rather than avoid experiences because they do not feel good enough or smart enough).<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be motivated to grow and learn by the power of their dreams, and not be held back by fears and limiting beliefs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Abigail Wilber was inspired to create â€˜Live In Visionâ€™ after participating in the Empowerment Institute program by David Gershon and Gail Straub- two of the worldâ€™s foremost authorities on behavior-change. The powerful learnings that Abigail experienced, combined with her desire to both learn from and help others, encouraged Abigail to develop her own unique series of workshops, specifically tailored to children. Abigailâ€™s workshops incorporate her belief in the power of the mind-body connection, as well as her passion for increased self-awareness through play, and cultivating a growth mindset. She has worked in schools for 15 years and has led workshops at Bard college and State University of New York at New Paltz. Abigail holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from SUNY New Paltz, and is a certified yoga instructor, in addition to an Empowerment Workshop Trainer. <br /><br />For any questions or to sign up you can e-mail or call:<br />Abigail.Wilber@gmail.com<br />(845) 853-9238<br />
