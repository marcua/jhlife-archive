				This is interesting: <br /><br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150212/jackson-heights/landlord-plans-rooftop-addition-jackson-heights-historic-district<br /><br />JACKSON HEIGHTS â€” The owner of a building in the neighborhood&#039;s Historic District has filed an application with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to build on top of his ground floor shops, according to city records.<br /><br />Charlie Patel, who owns 84-11 through 84-23 37th Ave., applied for the change on Dec. 30, 2014, including a &quot;rooftop extension&quot; and replacement of windows and doors, according to the agency. <br /><br />In 2011, the owners of the strip of stores next to Patel&#039;s began the hearing process to build a six-story apartment building on top of a strip of stores that had been gutted in 2010 by a fire.<br /><br />The apartment building opened last year.<br /><br />Since the building is in the neighborhood&#039;s historic district and landmarked, all construction work must get approval from the city agency.<br /><br />Permits with the Department of Buildings have not yet been filed for the project and it&#039;s unclear what type of extension Patel plans.<br /><br />A hearing for the proposal has not been scheduled, according to a spokeswoman for the LPC.<br /><br />The fate of the seven stores on 37th Avenue, including Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, the Jackson Heights Furniture Shop and Value Fabrics, is not clear.<br /><br />The owner of Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, Alex Chin, said he&#039;s on a month-to-month lease and is not sure what&#039;s going to happen to his business, which he&#039;s owned for seven years.<br /><br />&quot;We can stay here month to month until they get permits,&quot; he said of his shop at 84-11 37th Ave. &quot;There is no lease.&quot;<br /><br />But Alberto Sosa, who owns Jackson Heights Furniture at 84-15 37th Ave., said he has a three year lease and hasn&#039;t heard any plans for construction. <br /><br />Patel did not immediately comment. <br /><br />His lawyer, Howard Weiss with Davidoff, Hutcher and Citron LLP, did not respond to a call or email seeking comment.<br />

				Thank you for this update - a previous plan for this site fell thru.&nbsp; I would be interested in attending a hearing when there is one.

				I have a feeling construction may be imminent in this location. This poster of the planned building has been posted on the side of what was most recently the florist on the corner of 85th St. and 37th Ave.<br /><br />The rendering shows a Starbucks in one of the ground floor retail spaces, but I don&#039;t recall hearing that that was a sure thing.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/uHiExNO.jpg?1)
