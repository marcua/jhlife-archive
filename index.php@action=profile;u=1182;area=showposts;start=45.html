					<span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Do you wish you could get more organic, local veggies?</span><br /><br />Then you should join <strong>Farm Spot</strong> <a href="http://farmspot.org/about/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://farmspot.org/about/</a>&nbsp; We are a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program and our members pick up their shares at St. Mark&#039;s Church (33-50 82nd Street, Jackson Heights) from 5:30-8:15 on the Thursdays noted below.&nbsp; Members are asked to volunteer a minimum of 2 hours of time during the winter distribution if they purchase any share. Most volunteer shifts involve working at distribution which is a great way to meet folks and get to know more about the CSA model.&nbsp; Winter Season is a little different than the summer season which lasts 26 weeks and is weekly from June to November, but it is a great way to get a little taste of CSA to see if you like it.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have a lot of great options for the Winter Season including the <strong>Golden Earthworm Winter Shares</strong> (roots &amp; greenhouse greens) <strong>Briermere Farm </strong>(apple and cider shares), <strong>Winter Sun Farm </strong>Flash Frozen Summer Veggie Shares and now <strong>Village Fishmonger CSF Fish Shares!!</strong> Below are the dates for the 5 Winter Share distributions which take place every 3 weeks. Mark you calendars!!<br /><br />1 - December 19<br />2 - January 9<br />3 - January 30<br />4 - February 20<br />5 - March 13<br /><br /><strong>Golden Earthworm WINTER SHARES</strong> - Sign Up Here! <a href="http://www.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/winter2014" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/winter2014</a><br />The Golden Earthworm farm is nestled on 40 acres of pristine land protected by a land preservation program on the North Fork of Long Island. The farm was started in 1996 by Matthew Kurek, a chef turned farmer with a passion for growing beautiful, high-quality organic produce for the communities of Long Island. Since 2005, the farm has been co-owned and managed by Matthew and long-time friend and fellow farmer James Russo. Together, they grow over fifty different vegetables, berries and herbs for a CSA program with 14 local sites and 2 farmers’ markets. <a href="http://www.goldenearthworm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.goldenearthworm.com</a><br /><br /><br />Golden Earthworm WINTER VEGETABLE SHARE - Certified Organic <br />Approximately 15-18lbs of mixed root crops and greens (see list below)&nbsp; $150.00<br />Winter Share vegetables may include any of the following: <strong><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Beets, Potatoes, Rutabaga, Kohlrabi, Watermelon Radish, and possibly Kale</span>.</strong><br /><br />Briermere Farms WINTER APPLE SHARE - Non-Organic <br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">3lbs mixed apple varieties </span>$25.00<br /><br />Briermere Farms WINTER CIDER SHARE - Non-Organic <br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">1/2 gallon fresh-pressed cider</span> $24.50<br /><br />Briermere Farms is located just a short drive away from Golden Earthworm Farm on Sound Avenue in Riverhead. The farm produces a wide variety of tree fruit and berries. Although Briermere Farms is not certified organic, some of their crops, including raspberries, blueberries and blackberries are grown in a way which would fulfill the organic standards. <br /><br />Long Island is a difficult region for tree fruit production because of the high humidity levels which contribute to fungus disease pressure, and can decimate fruit quality (and sometimes the whole tree). At Briermere Farms, insecticides and fungicides are used only when needed to produce marketable fruit. The tree fruit is sprayed with 1 or 2 synthetic insecticides and fungicides at some point typically earlier in the season. No herbicides are used underneath the trees, and on-farm produced compost from leaves is the only fertilizer/nutrient source for their fruit crops.&nbsp; <br /><br />To Sign-up for Golden Earthworm and Briermere Shares - Click Here&nbsp; <a href="http://www.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/winter2014" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.farmigo.com/join/farmspot/winter2014</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>WINTER SUN FARM</strong> - Sign Up Here! <a href="http://www.farmigo.com/join/wintersunfarms/winter2013-2014" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.farmigo.com/join/wintersunfarms/winter2013-2014</a><br /><br />Winter Sun Farms is a small business based in New Paltz, NY that is committed to local food, sustainability, and fair prices for farmers and their food. They provide shares of flash frozen local summer vegetables and berries to members in the Hudson Valley and New York City throughout the winter months.<br /><br />Members pick up their shares every 3 weeks at Farm Spot. On each package you will see the name of the farm that the veggies came from and their harvest date, so you know exactly where your food is coming from. At each pick up members will get 7 items, including 5 frozen packages, 1 jar of tomato puree, and a pound of fresh pea shoots! One share costs $149 and is a good size for a family of 2-3. <br /><br />This year&#039;s share includes: <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>Frozen Blueberries, Peppers, Sweet Corn, Green Beans, Edamame, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Collard Greens, Kale, Butternut Squash Puree, Jarred Tomato Puree, Fresh Pea Shoots</strong></span><br /><br />To see recipes with share items, who their farm partners are for this upcoming season, visit their website here!<br /><br /><br /><strong>VILLAGE FISHMONGER CSF</strong> - Sign Up Here! <a href="http://csa.farmigo.com/join/villagefishmonger/CSF" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://csa.farmigo.com/join/villagefishmonger/CSF</a><br />The Village Fishmonger&#039;s community-supported fishery (&quot;csf&quot;) is the newest Farm Spot partner. They are a program where a member signs up for shares of seafood that village fishmonger gets directly from local fishermen. Operating year-round, the village fishmonger csf is your best source for weekly, delicious, fresh, responsibly harvested seafood.<br /><br />Share Composition<br />Shares will consist of <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">mostly filleted finfish</span> and sometimes shellfish or other ocean species. if you&#039;re interested in receiving shellfish more regularly, we also have <span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">add-on shares for oysters, clams and scallops</span> that you can choose from to supplement your main share.&nbsp; <br />Unlike produce or animals that are farmed, the availability and variety of wild-caught fish is dependent on a number of factors even beyond season, such as weather patterns, fishing location, ocean currents etc. we’ll be choosing what’s best and available based on our fishermen’s recommendation and let you know what’s available via the today&#039;s catch section on our website. but we’ll do our best to diversify the species you receive for the duration of your subscription so you can explore the rich and diverse selection of seafood that are sustainably managed in the ny region.<br /><br />Share Sizes<br />there are 2 share sizes to choose from:<br /><br />medium share<br />~2 lbs. (or equivalent value) at $30 per distribution, good for 2 meals for 2 people<br />small share<br />~1 lb. (or equivalent value) at $15 per distribution, good for 1 meal for 2 people<br /><br />To learn more about this new partner visit their website here! <a href="http://www.villagefishmongernyc.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.villagefishmongernyc.com</a><br /><br />If you have any questions about the sign up process or program, email us at <a href="mailto:farmspot@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">farmspot@gmail.com</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>We hope you will join us!! <br /><br />Warmly,<br />The Farm Spot Core Group</strong>

					Last week my husband and I were in Park Slope and met the owner of Le Gamin, a French<br />restaurant in the East Village and in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. He has a<br />mobile truck that he drives to the Union Square farmer&#039;s market and the<br />farmer&#039;s market in Park Slope, Brooklyn every week. We told him that we had<br />a thriving farmer&#039;s market in Jackson Heights as well as a play street on<br />Sundays where families are known to linger and work up an appetite. After<br />some lively discussion, and some delicious french fries, they have agreed to<br />bring their truck this Sunday to Jackson Heights!!<br /><br />If you have a penchant for croissants, croque monsieurs, crepes and crave<br />vendor variety beyond Mister Softy, please come on Sunday and buy some<br />french food! They even have ice cream and Nutella.<br /><br />Check out their menu:<br /><br /><a href="http://legamin.com/LG_MOBI_MENU.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://legamin.com/LG_MOBI_MENU.html</a><br /><br />-Braden &amp; Sarah<br />__._,_.___<br />
