								<div class="inner" id="msg_60769">Thanks all for coming together to influence what the Bruson Building owners (in this case Mr. Craig Bruno) will do with the renovated spaces on 37th Ave off 75th St.&nbsp; There are various opportunities here and I&#039;m glad we&#039;re exploring all avenues possible.&nbsp; We definitely don&#039;t need another McDonald&#039;s or Burger King in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I wish it could be as it was, with La Portena restaurant and Armando&#039;s Italian (I know they&#039;re moving to Northern Blvd) and Frank&#039;s (I know they&#039;re on 77th now)&nbsp; but I suppose they had to move on with their businesses after the fire.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll all agree, we need healthy food options, and spaces for families with children.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think opening a &quot;fast food&quot; franchise enhances our community. Some might say, well these are affordable restaurants, but so is say -- Pollos a la Brasa, or Tomo Japanese, or Arunee -- and at least these are far more unique, and offer an arguably friendlier atmosphere.&nbsp; <br /><br />There has been talk of possibly luring a franchise like Panera, and also backlash against that idea, and I&#039;d chime in that the one thing that is wonderful about Panera is they encourage community groups to come together in their coffee shops.&nbsp; They welcome clubs, support groups, even knitting circles (and aren&#039;t going to throw you to the curb as some places tend to do if you don&#039;t &quot;buy&quot; enough).&nbsp; <br /><br />Another franchise that is growing, that offers eco-conscious organic food options is Bareburger.&nbsp; (Any entrepreneurs on this forum who want to look into opening one up?)<br /><br />And just to chime in on Trader Joe&#039;s, I agree with many that it could be a delightful addition, since they offer creative &quot;no-frills&quot; items (&amp; really I know of no shop really like it around here)...I would just share that a couple of years ago I got a bunch of my neighborhood friends to write to TJ&#039;s to ask them to look into the empty Mandee&#039;s shop by Blockbuster (now thankfully occupied by Garden School UPK) TJs sent automatic responses that they&#039;d look into it -- and there would have been parking &quot;built in&quot; at that spot -- but they did not end up coming through obviously.&nbsp; At the time I also called the owners of that block of stores, and he let me know the exorbitant amount he was asking for per month...I said it&#039;d be great to have a studio there for kids&#039; workshops, or perhaps to bring in a Trader Joe&#039;s to compliment the greenmarket, and he just said he &quot;didn&#039;t think we needed another supermarket&quot;.&nbsp; As if we needed another car parts store!!]&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve also seen Whole Foods talked about on the local forums, and yes they offer a plethora of earth-friendly and unique options, but I believe they look for very affluent areas to settle in, so they may not look here... Luckily, we have the mom &amp; pop shop &quot;Downtown Market&quot; on 84th St that offers a lot of the same items. <br /><br />A couple of people along the way have mentioned book stores, which in essence are fantastic, though I know it can be hard to make a profit because of internet competition... I would be thrilled if the city would support the opening of a new Queens Library branch.&nbsp; I know that libraries are non-profit, so perhaps that also wouldn&#039;t bring in the kind of $$ the building owners are looking for... (But if it is funded by the city, doesn&#039;t that mean it is steady revenue?)&nbsp; I like to imagine a space to compliment the one on 81st, with space for interesting workshops, and all the learning opportunities a library offers for everyone.&nbsp; (Again I look at the library expansion happening right now in Long Island City with the branch in the Citibank building.&nbsp; It started out small, but they want to accommodate the need in the area, which is a need we also have)<br /><br />Several folks have also declared that we could use a bigger gym in our area...I completely agree, because it would be great to finally have a gym again that offered CLASSES!&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that our residents like to come together to do group aerobic exercise (as seen by posts on various forums) and basically we are currently using borrowed spaces at neighborhood schools (or going outdoors - which is fine - but during WARM weather)&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as could also be considered recently purchased White Castle corporate space on 69th St, we need more child-friendly spaces.&nbsp; NY Kids Club in LIC for example is a nice open room where kids can safely climb and move indoors, and there are ramps for strollers, which is really lacking right now our area.&nbsp; We have such great classes for young kids in Jackson Heights, but again right now they are generally held in spaces with no elevators, which make it extremely difficult for caretakers to safely bring their babies upstairs.&nbsp; <br /><br />It sounds like the &quot;new&quot; storefronts and offices at Bruson would be spacious, and could accommodate options like these, if the owner would open his mind to the possibilities.<br /></div>

The Trust wants $95/sq ft for the corners and $85 otherwise. And there&#039;s no basement, so you&#039;d be paying those rents for your prep area, office, etc. Plus add the cost of a buildout, and venting to the roof, because what you&#039;re getting is a concrete shell.<br /><br />For 2,000 sq ft at a corner, it&#039;s $190,000 per year. Otherwise, $170,000. Plus insurance, taxes, etc. A friend costed out 2,000 sq ft at one of the corners, and it worked out to something like $18,000 per month. Plus, almost certainly, an annual 3% increase (compounded, of course), which currently exceeds inflation. </div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_62520">This is my block. While I would LOVE to have a Fairway, Trader Joe&#039;s, etc. so close to my apartment, I wonder what, if any, community input or traffic study was done before deciding to open a large chain grocery store there. (I know that there was a hearing/meeting about this a while back, but I don&#039;t remember this being floated as a prospective tenant.) Traffic is horrible with all of the double-parking happening on 37th Ave (not to mention the blocked traffic from<del> Trade Fair</del> Global Supermarket&#039;s delivery trucks). Cars honk incessantly on 75th/37th. Parking is horrible and it was bad even before we lost a block and a half due to construction. I don&#039;t even want to think about what the traffic &amp; parking situation will be like when this new store opens up. From what I&#039;ve seen so far, it doesn&#039;t look as if an underground garage is in the works.<br /><br />I know that I&#039;m literally shouting NOT IN MY BACKYARD! But I really don&#039;t think that the immediately surrounding area can handle the traffic influx that will come with this type of store.</div>
