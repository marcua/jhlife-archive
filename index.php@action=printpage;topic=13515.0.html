				Hi,<br />I attached pics of the lady who says she is the dog walker, Lourdes Sambovl. She took her dog to this park knowing he has aggression. I was on the phone with the vet when she walked out of the dog park and could only get her name down. If anyone has any info on her or the dog in the pic I would greatly appreciate it. She or the dog should not be allowed into the park so stay clear if you see her.<br />Thanks for listening.

				Can anyone just walk in? I thought it was membership based. I would contact the person who is responsible for running the dog run. Do you have a better pic of the dog?

				Is it possible to make a police report for dog bites?&nbsp; Or is it just for when they bite humans?&nbsp; I would report this if they do take reports.&nbsp; It might not do anything but you can also plaster her photo/name all over the place too.&nbsp; She should be paying your vet bills as well.&nbsp; I&#039;m so sorry about your dog and hope he heals soon!&nbsp;

				Thank you all for your concern. It is a membership based park and I have been in touch with the people that run it, they have been great and responsive. I just become aware this dog is a repeat offender and it looks like it&#039;s not going to be so easy to get in touch with the owner of the dog... I&#039;ll keep trying. At this point I just want people to be aware of this lady and this dog.

				the owner is also liable for your dogs injuries. I would definitely make a police report. I hope your baby is ok.

				I use that park infrequently but would like to know what kind of dog it was so I can be aware. <br /><br />By the way: Does the key code for entry ever change? I get the impression that it&#039;s kind of an open secret.

				Dang, sorry to hear about your dog, is he/she doing better today?<br /><br />That lady looks familiar, I probably ran into her while she was walking her dog while I was walking mine. Are you trying to find her?<br /><br />So your dog got bit and she just walked away? That&#039;s not a very responsible pet owner/walker...she is still liable <br /><br />If I run into her with the dog in the neighborhood, what should I do?

				That&#039;s Awful. <br /><br />You can try and ask around. If she is a dog walker you may find her on other dog run groups. There is a dog run group on FB Called &quot;Friends of Sherry Park Dog Run&quot; You can ask to become part of that group and then post about her. I&#039;m sure they will be grateful to know who she so they to can be on the look out.<br /><br />Best,<br />Theresa&nbsp; &nbsp;
