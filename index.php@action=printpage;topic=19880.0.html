				Was there around 9.30 (no line) and they do have fish but looked as if still setting up. Mask, gloves, and the door attendant aimed a thermometer at my forehead, then squirted sanitizer on my gloves. They have distance markers. <br /><br />Other markets (between abut 10 and noon): Foodtown and later Patel longer lines than I could face.<br /><br />Key Food no line. <br /><br />Growing farm no line.<br /><br />Mango Rico short line. They have those big blueberries, 18oz, 2 for $5<br /><br />Downtown Natural short line but long delay letting people in.<br /><br />Lemon Farm no line.<br /><br />Kim still looks rather cramped, didn&#039;t try.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				So happy the Asian supermarket is back! And Patel&#039;s line is horrendous, but I still love that place. Only market to get decent okra. :(

				I just came back from it, no line at all. Everything is fully stocked. They didn&#039;t ask that I didn&#039;t have glove. Some of the stuff seem like very pricey, mostly the veggie, meat and rice. But yeah just happy they are open, since I ran out of rice.<br />

				Veggies have been pricey since lockdown, but yea, this particular Asian market is usually more $, but would actually pay more to avoid the long line in Manhattan Chinatown.

				They are on the expensive side, but (pre-pandemic) often have a good price on free-range eggs and broccoli and (in season) fuyu and apples. Once they used to have the best price on mushrooms but that seems to have passed. Very glad they are open again - convenience outweighs budget in some instances and the salmon I bought on Tuesday was very nice, though experience warns that depends on the actual fish!

				i wonder if prices on the packaged goods that actually come from China have increased in price due to tariffs put in place over the past few months. a fair number of those are imported from across east and southeast Asia.

Hope it&#039;s not as crowded like Patel. Also wished Fay Da (only two branches have reopened) and Double Rainbow reopen soon. I&#039;ve read many news that some food businesses decided to close doors instead. Can&#039;t imagine how many more restaurant obituaries we&#039;ll be seeing in the next few months...
