				So the boyfriend and I ordered a mini pizza and a salad from Thomas tonight.&nbsp; When It arrived, the delivery guy said &quot;$20.&quot;&nbsp; $20?&nbsp; For a mini and a salad?&nbsp; &quot;No,&quot; he replied.&nbsp; &quot;MEDIUM.&quot;&nbsp; But we ordered a MINI.&nbsp; TEN INCH.&nbsp; &quot;No.&nbsp; Medium.&quot;&nbsp; Well we&#039;re not going to pay for something we didn&#039;t order.&nbsp; Should we call the restaurant?&nbsp; &quot;Ok.&quot;&nbsp; So the boyfriend rang them up, explained the situation, the restaurant asked to speak with the delivery guy, got back on the phone with boyfriend, yadda yadda yadda.&nbsp; The long and short of it was that the guy at the restaurant asked us to KEEP FOUR SLICES AND SEND THE REST BACK.&nbsp; Which we did.&nbsp; Because we were hungry.&nbsp; But what are they doing with the rest of that pizza?&nbsp; I can only imagine that they&#039;re going to sell it as slices.&nbsp; Which is gross.&nbsp; I mean call me a little hygiene-obsessive, but I wouldn&#039;t want to eat a slice of pizza that had already been in another customer&#039;s kitchen.&nbsp; Ew.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />...And I mean maybe they were just going to eat it themselves?<br /><br />...Or it was just the principle of the thing?<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll be looking for a new pizza place now.&nbsp; After I eat this one last slice. <br />

				I think I was probably in denial about its grossness, but I really felt like I had to share that experience.&nbsp; There&#039;s gross, and then there&#039;s USED FOOD.<br /><br />Any tips on a more acceptable pizza place?<br />

				I wouldn&#039;t assume that they are going to serve your returned pizza.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t sound like they did the right thing from a customer service standpoint, but perhaps they gave the other half of the pizza to the delivery guy or threw it away.<br /><br />I like Louie&#039;s (Elmhurst) and Sam&#039;s (Northern in the high 80s).

				I really doubt they re-sold the slices, they probably dumped them or just ate them.&nbsp; It is common practice for pizza places to make you return the pizza if you call and say they got the order wrong.&nbsp; They will bring you a new one, but they always take the old one.&nbsp; Otherwise they&#039;d be dealing with scammers always calling because their order was &quot;wrong&quot;.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little odd because they asked for half of the pizza back, but I guess it&#039;s policy.&nbsp; But if you are regulars, they should have just let it go.<br /><br />I have to say - they have my least favorite pizza in NY. It&#039;s just awful (to me).&nbsp; Least favorite in the world: Lido&#039;s Pizza in the DC-area - it&#039;s like matzoh with catsup. And people love it! Does.not.compute.

				I&#039;ve worked in the restaurant business and I think what happened to you the other night is just plain disgusting!&nbsp; Bottom line if they care to have your repeat business they would have eaten the loss instead of showing a most unacceptable compromise.&nbsp; Now if you ever care to order from them again you will wonder if your pizza is a &quot;redelivered one&quot;..........not a good business move!&nbsp; It&#039;s most likely that they sold these slices later in the store!!!!!&nbsp; :o

				My thoughts exactly, Griswold Contessa!&nbsp; We order from them on a fairly regular basis.&nbsp; They hadn&#039;t ever done something quite so reprehensible before, although they had a history of &quot;forgetting&quot; our credit card receipt and trying to get us to give them cash upon delivery.&nbsp; We will DEFINITELY be trying Louie&#039;s as you suggested!

				I have to admit, I&#039;ve been having a great time telling the story.<br /><br />Tried Louie&#039;s the other night...ordered fettuccine with creamy pesto and promptly went into a food coma.&nbsp; :buck2:&nbsp; Delicious!&nbsp; AND supremely inexpensive with crazy fast delivery.&nbsp; We&#039;ll be trying their pizza next.

				If you like chicken try the chicken and tomato..there&#039;s so much chicken on each slice that two slices would make a meal and if you&#039;re looking for a lighter meal the margarita pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil hits the spot!!&nbsp; :)

				Louie&#039;s is officially our new go-to Italian.&nbsp; And we haven&#039;t even tried the pizza yet!&nbsp; The guys that work there are fantastic and always sound so excited when we call and ask for the specials!&nbsp; (You MUST try the chicken provencial.&nbsp; Drool.&nbsp; Stomach Grumble.)&nbsp; Thanks for pointing me toward Louie&#039;s&nbsp; :smitten:

				Louie&#039;s is pretty great. We&#039;ve had the Agnolotti, Margarita pizza, Grandma pizza, and a plain ole pie with mushrooms on it, and all were fantastic.<br /><br />From their take-out menu:<br /><br />81-34 Baxter Avenue, Elmhurst<br /><br />718.440-9346<br /><br />They definitely deliver, in more ways than one!&nbsp; ;)

				Been to Louie&#039;s as well and they are very very nice, good food and are really into what they do.&nbsp; Elmhurst famous pizza on 37th opposite Trade Fair has good mini pizza and great chicken parmigiana, unfortunately though they cook the spaghettii about 45 minutes too long....just scrape it off and don&#039;t bother, it&#039;s the chicken that matters!
