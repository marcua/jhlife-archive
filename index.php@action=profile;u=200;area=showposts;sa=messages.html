					Thanks, that&#039;s really nice to hear!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been posting on here but I figure you&#039;re all on our email list already, (or maybe you&#039;re an anonymous troll that hates us and you&#039;re not on the list!) but just to get you guys up to speed we&#039;ve been gently ramping up what we do but in a limited way because we&#039;re being very careful about bringing staff in.<br /><br />First of all we&#039;ve been cooking meals for healthcare workers and it&#039;s all possible because of donations that people have made, which is really very very awesome!<br /><br />We&#039;re also offering a family meal most nights of the week, good for 2-3 adults or a family, check our email list for details.<br /><br />Finally we&#039;re also making &quot;care packages&quot; which are boxes filled with staples such as flour, beans, milk, butter, onions, greens, bacon, bread etc which you can come pick up, we&#039;re going to be doing those on Saturday.<br /><br />Check our website to sign up for our email list - thequeensboro.com<br /><br />We&#039;ll get through this, somehow, I hope, maybe!<br /><br />

					Friends, we&#039;re very sad to say that we have made the difficult decision to temporarily close delivery and pickup at The Queensboro, starting today. It is too risky right now to continue to ask our employees to come to work when the rate of infections are rising the way they are.<br /><br />Over the past couple of weeks we have been moved by the incredible outpouring of support from you, our regulars and neighbors and friends. We cannot thank you enough.<br />&nbsp;<br />We don&#039;t know when we will reopen. We will be - like everyone else - obsessively monitoring every scrap of news, and when we see that it won&#039;t be a risk to ask people to come back to work, we will once more start bringing our food and drinks to your homes.<br /><br />And then, eventually, we will actually welcome you into our space.<br /><br />We cannot wait.<br /><br />Until then, thank you Jackson Heights. You are amazing, and we will see you all soon.<br /><br />The Queensboro Team.<br /><br /><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_3dfc5ccca8824dbf9b126353fcde1baa~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />

					Hello neighbors! I hope you are all staying safe, and healthy. Times are tough and everything is up in the air and we have no idea what is coming down the line, but for now The Queensboro is doing delivery, for brunch today and dinner later, and then lunch/dinner throughout the rest of the week.<br /><br />We will be closed tomorrow - Monday - though, because we need to rest and stock up and prep for the week. <br /><br />So if you want some of our food delivered to you, check our website at <a href="https://www.thequeensboro.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.thequeensboro.com</a> - our menu is on there, you can order directly through the site and in a short while you&#039;ll be munching away on some delicious Queensboro food! You can also come pick it up if you prefer, we&#039;ll leave your food at the entrance of the restaurant so you won&#039;t need to deal with anyone closer than 6 feet.<br /><br />What&#039;s pretty amazing is that you can order beer <strong>and</strong> wine <strong>and</strong> cocktails for delivery, so... get to it Jackson Heights, please order a ton of food from all of the local independent restaurants, they very much need it these days.<br /><br />Thanks!

In response to suggestions and requests from the community, we will be adding a lunch menu for delivery/pick-up, as well as some additional freezer-friendly meals. We&#039;ll have more information on this as soon as possible.<br /><br />We would like to please request that if you order food to pick up, please call us at 929 296 0038 in order to avoid the GrubHub fees that we would incur.

To that end we&#039;ve implemented several measures:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>We are telling our staff to avoid coming in if they&#039;re feeling sick or if they think they may have come in contact with someone who is.</li><li>We are increasing the frequency and thoroughness of our already stringent cleaning and sanitation practices throughout the restaurant, and are cleaning tables, door handles and other surfaces with a strong anti-viral solution.</li><li>We have increased the space between our dining tables for the comfort of our guests.</li><li>We have set up a hand-sanitizing station at the front entrance for our staff and guests to use.</li></ul><br />Finally, with the new rules concerning restaurant capacity - we are temporarily limited by the city to half of our maximum occupancy - if you&#039;re coming for dinner or brunch, please make a reservation to avoid disappointment!<br /><br />These are uncertain times, but as your neighborhood restaurant we&#039;re here for you. If you are able to, we hope you&#039;ll continue to support your local businesses and look out for your neighbors, especially if they are elderly or otherwise vulnerable and have limited ability to leave their homes.<br /><br /><strong>Delivery</strong><br /><br />Our full menu is available via delivery, we do ask that if you want to order online <a href="https://www.thequeensboro.com/order-online" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><strong>please use this link on our website</strong></a> to reduce the delivery fees that we incur. If you want to pick up your meal yourself, you can call the restaurant directly at 929 296 0038 to place your order, and you will avoid all of those GrubHub fees.<br /><br /><strong>Sunday Suppers</strong><br /><br />This Sunday our Sunday Supper will celebrate Saint Patrick&#039;s Day week with some corned beef and rarebit.<br /><br />We&#039;re also super proud to have booked The Prodigals again for St Paddy&#039;s Day itself at 5PM on the 17th!<br /><br />The week after that we&#039;re featuring some Salmon Wellington, and to finish the month off we&#039;ll be offering pork chops, rice pilaf and braised greens!<br /><br /><a href="https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2020-03-15&amp;seats=2" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Make a reservation</a> and let us know that you&#039;re coming for the Sunday Supper!

We have some fantastic deals all week, see below for details.<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, on Wednesday we will be board gaming with the great folks at Shenanigans, more info further below. <br />&nbsp;<br />Then, if you&#039;re a parent of a young-ish kid and you&#039;re at your wits end of what to do with them after an entire week off, on Friday we&#039;re going to help you out by hosting an afternoon tots and parent&#039;s happy hour in our party room! <br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, on a completely different vibe, If you&#039;re in the mood to party on Saturday night we&#039;re hosting a Princess Party Drag Show again!<br /><br /><strong>Wine, Pizza, Oysters, Happy Hour! </strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Do you remember all of the specials that we offer during the week? Here&#039;s a refresher in case you forgot. <br />&nbsp;<br />Every weekday - Happy Hour until 7PM! That&#039;s $5 draft beers, $7 glasses of house wine, $8 house cocktails<br />Tuesdays - All bottles of wine are half price<br />Wednesdays - All pizzas are $12<br />Thursdays - Oysters special! Half a dozen oysters and a glass of rosé, or cava, or stout, for $16<br /><br /><strong>Wednesday Board Gaming!</strong><br /><br />Join us on Wednesday starting at 6:30 for our weekly gaming night with Shenanigas NY. They supply the fun board games and the Game Gurus to guide the event, you just need to show up and get ready to enjoy a great night! <br />&nbsp;<br />You can join in by paying $5 on the night, but if you <a href="https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-14" class="bbc_link" target="_blank"><strong>book it in advance</strong></a> for $10 you&#039;ll knock $5 off your check of $25 or more, and be entered into a raffle for some very cool prizes!<br /><br /><strong>Tots &amp; Tonic Happy Hour on Friday</strong><br /><br />What&#039;s this, another school-free week? When do these kids learn anything? Here at The Q we have nothing but respect for the fine folks at the NYC DoE, but don&#039;t you think that sometimes they should maybe consider the parents when they schedule so many holidays for these kids?<br />&nbsp;<br />Well, we may have a partial solution to this! If by Friday your kids are driving you absolutely nuts, bring them to The Q so they can run around in the party room downstairs while you have a drink and relax a little! <br />&nbsp;<br />We do ask that you remain with your kids though, those Lord of the Flies situations tend to go south pretty quickly. <br />&nbsp;<br />Happy hour drinks, chalkboard activities, and snacks! The fun starts at 3PM. <br /><br /><strong>Saturday, February 22nd, Princess Party Drag Show!</strong><br /><br />Ducky Sheaboi and Patsy Indecline are coming back!
