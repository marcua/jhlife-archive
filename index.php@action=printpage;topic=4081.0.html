				In the 1950&#039;s and 60&#039;s there was a Kosher deli on the south side of Northern Boulevard between 89th and 90th Streets (one block east of White Castle.&nbsp; I&#039;m racking my brain trying to remember the deli&#039;s name.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a JH old timer with a mind that&#039;s at least semi-intact, the gauntlet has been thrown.

				I&#039;m going to answer my own question.&nbsp; I recently visited Room 100 at the 42nd Street Library and was able to view on microfilm, a Queens telephone directory from the 1950&#039;s. The place I was trying to think of was Feldman&#039;s Kosher Delicatessen &amp; Restaurant at 89-16 Northern Boulevard.

				Definitely.&nbsp; While it may not have been there in 1950, it was certainly there by the middle of the decade.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my follow up post I found the name,&nbsp; Feldman&#039;s Deli, in a 1950&#039;s phone book in the New York Public Library.&nbsp; Did you live in that area?&nbsp; If so, on what street and during what years?

We moved there from 93rd St. between Northern and 32nd Ave. I can remember a cleaners, a grocery, a candy store (Dreyfus&#039;s&#039; I think we called it), and Krieger&#039;s butcher shop (he used to make &#039;unofficial&#039; meat deliveries at night to one&#039;s door during the war).

				During the mid to late 1950&#039;s the retailers I remember on that block include (from 89th Street heading east on Northern Boulevard to 90th Street):&nbsp; Whelan&#039;s Drug Store, The Old Acquaintance Tavern, liquor store, Kayar Bakery, Feldman&#039;s Kosher Delicatessen &amp; Restaurant, Joe&#039;s candy store.&nbsp; Off the corner on 89th Street between Northern Boulevard and 34th Avenue was Ben&#039;s Barber Shop.<br /><br />I lived at 86-11 34th Avenue from 1951 to 1965 and at 33-27 91st Street from 1965 to 1974.&nbsp; I had a few friends who lived at 89-14 34th Avenue, but they would only have been 3 or 4 years old in 1954:&nbsp; Irwin Corman, David Adler and Harold Laufgraben.

They too were not old enough to be my friends -- lived down the hall from me -- but I do know that Howie Goldner became a New Jersey state trooper.&nbsp; I know this because -- believe it or not -- he picked me up on the Garden State one morning for speeding. I didn&#039;t recognize him but he knew me from my registration and license. We chatted for a bit and he gave me a warning citation --- &quot;Gotta give you something. We&#039;re already on the camera.&quot; It is, truly, not a very big world.

				That&#039;s a great small world story about the NJ State Trooper. Speaking of change, I mentioned that my parents moved to 33-27 91st Street, part of a coop development called Southridge, in 1965.&nbsp; At the time you moved out of 89-14 in 1954, Southridge didn&#039;t even exist.

All the xxxridges had yet to appear and the places where they now stand were open fields, some of which still bore plow marks. We children called them, collectively, &quot;the lots,&quot; and did not realize, until too late, how fortunate we were to have them in which to play. Northridge did come along in 1954 -- I think -- and that marked the beginning of the &quot;red canyons.&quot; All of those buildings started life as rental apartments... You probably knew that.<br /><br />Did you live in that very nice building with the two tower &#039;dunce-caps?&#039; &nbsp;As a child I always wished that I could live there.

				Some of the lots were still in existence in 1956 when my mother would walk me to kindergarten at P.S. 149. We lived directly across 34th Avenue from the prewar building with the &#039;dunce-caps.&#039;&nbsp; Our building, 86-11, was called The Bristol, and was part of a five building group called Saxony Apartments.&nbsp; The other buildings were The Cumberland (had a playground attached on the 88th Street side), The Dorset, The Chatham, and The Sheffield.&nbsp; The developer was obviously an Anglophile.
