				Are we STILL eating cheese in 2020? <br /><br />You realize milk from other animals are from MOTHERS and the MILK is for their BABIES... right?<br /><br />Those babies are forced to wear anti-suckling devices that hurt the mother whenever the baby tries to suckle. All because YOU want to eat cheese.<br /><br />Babies are then either bred to be cow-producing &quot;mothers&quot; themselves, or shipped to veal farms. Google it. Enlighten yourselves. I have nothing good to say about cheese in 2020. Wake up, sheeple.<br /><br /><strong>Mod note: topic split from one discussing a JH store</strong>

I predict within 10 years, half the population will look at cheese in disgust as more become educated on the goodness of plant based foods. After all, cheese is made from the milk of cows (usually) whose milk is meant for their newborns... but instead stolen so humans can make dairy products from it. Imagine that! Soon we will have cheese museums and meat museums so future generations can see just how barbaric this generation was.<br /><br />Totally not for a cheese store in this neighborhood.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Guess your New Year&#039;s Resolution for 2020 wasn&#039;t to be less annoying.

				I guess because it was set off by a discussion about the cheese store. I think this poster had predicted failure for this new business because in 2020 who would seriously want to eat cheese? I seem to recall something like that being posted. Don&#039;t we all know how bad cheese is in so many ways...etc....Well to each his own.
