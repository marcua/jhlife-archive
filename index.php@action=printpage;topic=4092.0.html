				Queens Crap is filled with it&#039;s quota of bigots, racists and misanthropic malcontents.<br /><br />That said, has anyone walked down Roosevelt Avenue lately? There are drugs, prostitution, illegal id cards all being flogged openly on the streets. When the weekend is over it looks like hell, garbage strewn everywhere.<br /><br />There are things that I love about this neighborhood, but it definitely has some issues.

				I have to agree Gherm. There are many different worlds that coexist in Jackson Heights. That&#039;s part of its charm. For me it remains a great place to live--although I certainly can do without the trash, prostitution, drugs, etc. What I think rings true for many long time residents who grew up here and or have lived here for awhile is that the problems never seem to get resolved. Roosevelt Ave has been a blight ever since I can remember, and despite all the fallacious attempts to to &quot;clean it up&quot; nothing ever seems to get resolved. It continues to erode the quality of life in the neighborhood. I am hoping that with new political leadership we will see a shift---for the good of everyone who lives here.

				When I commented on the author&#039;s post in QC, I mentioned the conditions of Roosevelt Ave. Although I reside in Elmhurst, I do most of my shopping, eating at restaurants, etc. in Jackson Heights. It is a wonderful neighborhood. I&#039;m glad I was able to grow up in the area. That being said, it is hard to overlook the deplorable conditions of Roosevelt Ave. I hope Danny Drumm, Julissa Ferraras, and Jose Peralta can work together and start a new &quot;Cleaning- Up&quot; initiative for the Ave. Can this be done? And if so, how can we get the community involved?

				The only way JH can be cleaned up is to get rid of the illegals, all of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;:tickedoff:<br /><br />They lived in squalor&#039;s in their country, and then come here and trash it up.<br />Most don&#039;t follow the rules and regulations of how to keep things clean and neat.<br />If they handed out tickets for every person spitting on the street we would be able to pay China back in no time.<br /><br />Over the weekend I was standing at the bus stop and standing next to me was a young guy he looked over to his left and spit with in and inch of his own foot, and then did it again. I moved over and he gave me a look like what is wrong with me...Now I do not know when spitting became a past time or a hobby.<br />But do people think this is sanitary, and don&#039;t people think that this contributes to diseases.<br /><br />&nbsp;I do know is that I am sick of seeing the ground covered with gum, dog crap, dog urine, garbage, homes that have been converted into store fronts. Mattresses in the front peoples homes.<br /><br />I shutter at the thought of brothels here with women who were or are brought here to perform sex acts against their will. Forest Hills is the Beverly Hills of Queens and this in no way shape or form would this happen. BTY, that is how most of these so called store fronts are able to pay the rent. It is because most are dubious. <br />

				@ 77th.<br /><br />Totally agree with you. :rockon:<br /><br />You know what you should do when you finally open your business in JH? Have a sign that reads:<br /><br />- No illegals (after all, you wouldn&#039;t want to take their filthy money) Better yet, have a scanner that can read people&#039;s IDs so that only residents can shop at your store. And if you must allow them inside -oy!- (because of the law and shit), you can always have an area for illegals and one for legal residents. Oh...and make sure the residents get to sit at the front of the store. Yeah. Good old days! --but I&#039;m not referring to the good old days prior to the time when a whole bunch of illegals came over on ships and totally took over this land from Native Americans. Then went on to destroying entire villages because of their filthy way of living, diseases and plain old barbaric nature. Nah, that stuff happened too long ago for us to care or remember. It&#039;s not like history ever repeats itself and a group of people uses another as scapegoat when their lives aren&#039;t going the way they want them to. Right?<br /><br />I doubt you would understand my comments but if you if you having nothing better to do, pick up a history book and maybe then you will think before you write.

				i think &quot;book&quot; may be one of the few four letter words 77th wouldn&#039;t know.<br /><br />perhaps he should have a sitdown with joe crowley, the proud descendent of illegal immigrants -- who has admitted as much on a regular basis. or perhaps he should prove every bit of his lineage is legal, or move back to a more appropriate place.

				Wow it appears as though 77th bought out some visceral responses from some folks.&nbsp; I guess we have to ask why is it that Roosevelt Ave. is so filthy?&nbsp; The elevated line in Astoria is not this way so we can&#039;t blame the &quot;El&quot; I think we should ask &quot;WHY&quot; and then try to address the problem constructively.

				The Elevated line in Astoria is not much better if you ask me.&nbsp; There may be a couple of reasons why it appears to be better though. <br /><br />First the construction of the tracks etc. for the N and W trains appear to me to be wider which allows for a greater sense of space under the tracks. There&#039;s certainly more room for traffic to flow slightly better underneath as well. <br /><br />Second there is nowhere near as much commercial development under the N/W lines as there is under the 7 so ultimately there&#039;s less traffic and a few stretches of desolate space that is littered with all sorts of trash. <br /><br />Maybe up by Ditmars Boulevard there&#039;s comparable commercial development, and I would argue there&#039;s just as much dirt and filth there as there is on Roosevelt. But wider sidewalks make it seem like less. <br /><br />If Roosevelt had better lighting that might help matters a bit. If it didn&#039;t have buses going down it that would help traffic flow. If the 115th Pct. and the 110th Pct. could get together and police it properly that would likely help with crime issues.

				Unlike Astoria,&nbsp; Roosevelt Avenue has a denser amount of illegal activity.&nbsp; Prostitution, money laundering, drugs, illegal conversions and vendors all require a multi agency approach that is ongoing. Yes, Astoria is no great shakes especially under the L-- but Roosevelt Avenue is an ongoing saga that never seems to change.&nbsp; It&#039;s too bad too cause it&#039;s the gateway into the Jackson Heights community.

				At a recent event hosted by Jose Peralta I believe it was a captain or high level officer form the 115th reported that the crime rate had dropped in the area over the past few months. Additionally a representative of the Queens DA&#039;s office reported that the illegal social security card business had seen a dip as well in this area and is now largely concentrated in The Bronx. <br /><br />Clearly this doesn&#039;t mean Roosevelt has become the safest and cleanest Ave. in NYC, and I know data can be manipulated. But, sometimes it seems an area gets a reputation and keeps long after it has been cleaned up. Clearly, Roosevelt has a long way to go.&nbsp; It would seem continued efforts on enforcement of existing laws and a regular police presence would help to continue reducing crime on the avenue. <br /><br />As far as blaming all of Roosevelt&#039;s problems on undocumented immigrants, I&#039;m not buying it. Legal or not there will always be people committing crime, running drug and prostitution rings etc. I think it&#039;s misguided to think that rounding up one specific group based on immigration status will solve any or all of the problems plaguing Roosevelt. <br /><br />A multi-agency approach makes a great deal of sense. NYPD should focus on enforcing NYC laws, they should not (and are not) be in the business of enforcing Federal Laws. Let Homeland Security and ICE deal with immigration issues.&nbsp; Sanitation, local politicians, and other agencies should focus on clean up and improvement.

				agreed on all counts, Aronan.<br /><br />i don&#039;t like the sort of thing that goes on on Roosevelt, though it is MUCH safer than it was, say, 20 years ago. but to blame this sort of crime on illegal immigrants alone would presume that the Gottis, Gambinos, Castellanos et al of the world are and were all illegals.

				The street under the elevated trains in Astoria is not nice, (with the possible exception of Ditmars and 31st). But there&#039;s generally also not a lot of stuff there- the stores tend to be on the avenues (Ditmars, 23rd, 24th, 30th, Broadway), and Steinway (which has an underground). It&#039;s not nearly as developed with storefronts as Roosevelt- once you leave Ditmars and 31st- which has gotten so much nicer in the last 10 years- the stores on 31st are not stores that I generally went to.<br /><br />I lived in the Ditmars area from 2000-2002 and the quality of the stores on Ditmars and 31st between Ditmars and 24th has gotten so much nicer since then. Back then there was no Rosarios (well, they moved in around 2001), no Blooming Company, no sushi places, no thai places, and much more fast food and dollar stores.<br /><br /><br />

				Years ago, the then Community Board Chair asked the police department to place satellite precincts along Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; They would have been modeled after the storefront precincts you find in places like Philadelphia, or even Tokyo.&nbsp; Basically, you would take an empty storefront in a &quot;hot spot&quot; along Roosevelt, throw in desks and other equipment and deploy some officers.&nbsp; You establish a police presence in an area where crime is a problem. The cops also establish relationships with the merchants and residents.&nbsp; They become part of the community.<br /><br />I know that some people resist the call for more police, but I never bought into the philosophy that you set up a fortress-like precinct in one part of a community and have all the law enforcement resources work out of there.&nbsp; It isolates the officers from the community and the benefit of having the police close by is only shared by a few residents.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind getting off the subway late at night and having a satellite precinct a few doors down.

				Agreed with the previous poster...have no idea why cops don&#039;t walk neighborhood beats to get the chronic problems under control.&nbsp; A lot of individual crimes can probably be traced to a few central problem locations / phenomena, such as underground brothels, drugs, fake ID rings, etc.<br /><br />On the original topic, Queenscrap is full of bitter, pathetic commenters that are really lamenting their lost youth and not saying anything substantive about Queens reality today.

				Hi,<br /><br />I get slammed all the time about Jackson Heights. &nbsp;My buyer&#039;s will not explore the possibilities of stepping outside the district to purchase an apartment and it seems that Jackson Heights encompasses only a few blocks.<br /><br />I had a buyer indicate that he would rather spend approximately $100K more to live closer to the train, rather than purchase a huge 1,500 sq. ft. unit on 88th Street. &nbsp;The unit is absolutely gorgeous and has more space, than a few units located in the high 70&#039;s. <br /><br />I question whether that indeed is the case, but unfortunately, one never knows.<br /><br />And what am I suppose to do? &nbsp;As much as I love Jackson Heights, it&#039;s a very, very busy community, with many issues that may not be politically correct to address, but warrants attention.<br /><br />Best, &nbsp; :smiley6600:<br /><br />

				As referred to in Aronan&#039;s post yesterday, Roosevelt Ave. in our neighborhood is divided between two police precincts and it seems they have never really worked out a comprehensive plan between the two to curb illegal activity.&nbsp; Because of that, it&#039;s kind of a &quot;no man&#039;s land&quot; for all sorts of nefarious doings.&nbsp; &nbsp;A regular police presence there would be a big step in the right direction and I don&#039;t mean just driving by in a car. Also, because of the overcrowding of people and businesses in such a narrow corridor, the Sanitation Dept. seems to have given up even a hint of a desire to keep trash from overflowing all over the place.&nbsp; They have now similarly abandoned other parts of the neighborhood as well and, if we did not have the BID pitching in to clean up parts of 37th Ave., that would look like hell too.<br /><br />The question is, how do we address this as a community?&nbsp; Individual complaints don&#039;t seem to go very far.<br /><br />

				oooooh!!! looks like the truth hurts.<br /><br />First of all Username/jjhs you have a point about how our heritages yours/mine came here, so in essence we all need to pack clean up it up and give it back to the Indians.<br /><br />In the 1600&#039;s the Dutch/German were the first to come to NY and dominate and eradicate the American Indians the true Americans out of the this land. The oldest and riches families that came here were the Rockefeller&#039;s, Astors, The Bronx family<br />which the Bronx and one time was an estate. How&#039;s that for history....<br /><br />What I should have included but for got, so I will do it now is that one posters had said that the people were dreaming of yest-er year. Yest er year was when immigrants came here in the late 1800&#039;s/1900&#039;s, and followed the laws of the land<br />they kept it clean and did not turn it into what look like their home back from where ever. Hung the American Flag with pride and learned the language as best as they could. They came here humbled by the experience and tried to fit or blend in. <br /><br />They did not spit on the floor/ throw garbage on the ground nor did they trash apartments.<br />The mentality was way different back then and the caring and respect they showed is far different than today.<br />More over the men dressed well wore actual jacket and slacks, women wore dresses coats and would not dream of wearing some of the outfits that some of men and women wear today. Back most men and women didn&#039;t have much as far as clothes go except for the wealthy. However the one or two suits that did have were kept clean worn everyday. Back then people knew how to carry themselves today I have no idea what is going on in the minds of&nbsp; people.<br /><br />If I were to move to another country the right thing to do is ask what are the proper procedures to follow of the land,and not to piss anyone off or offend them that&#039;s all I am saying here. There are rules here that are broken from spitting on the floor to turning your terrace into a storage place that it makes it look like Beijing.....is what makes neighborhood look bad.<br /><br />Yet, from the sounds of it you seem like the type to plop down anywhere do as you feel, and make a comment well in my country it&#039;s ok to do this....Good night.

I&#039;m sick and tired that JH is always getting slammed for everything , its like people have this whole stereotype in their mind that JH is some third world ghetto . Why ?&nbsp; because they see Roosevelt Ave or 82nd st and freak out. They say its shady , dangerous and dirty and judge JH as a whole. But, they don&#039;t notice that JH is pretty big and we have other main avenues and thoroughfares such as 37th, 35th , 34th, &amp; Northern Blvd and sooo on . These for the most part are very clean with the exception of 37th ave in some parts and most of our side streets are impeccable . Also, in all of the 20 years I have lived here I have never been a victim of a crime or seen one . Yes Roosevelt Ave might be shady and dirty at times , but there is more to JH than Roosevelt Ave , 74th st , or 82nd st , just as there is more than the Jackson Heights Historical District . The closed mindedness of people is ridiculous especially in those sites such as Queens Crap . They think Forest Hills is perfect , beautiful, and flawless IT&#039;S NOT ! Ever been on the corner of Continental Ave and Queens Blvd or the corridor that stretches to Austin St . OOOO boy some of the people who hang around that corner sure are shady and it&#039;s really dirty . FH might have Gap, B&amp;N, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic &amp; Eddie Bauer , but it also has sooo much crappy retail , actually a lot of bad retail that is almost or just as bad as the ones we have here . FH also does not realize that if it wasn&#039;t for Forest Hill Gardens , I highly doubt a majority of those big name retail stores would be there . FHGardens , spikes the demographics of FH as a whole , not only that but FH is huge in comparison to size and housing stock , there are huge apt buildings 20+ stories . I have thought of moving various times to FH and it does not justify at all to move there when your already living in JH . Basically take FHGardens away and the perks that it brought to FH , and there isn&#039;t much to desire in FH, it would be another Rego Park , not that there is anything wrong with Rego Park . When it comes to immigration , we are all immigrants unless YOU are a Native American . Being dirty has nothing to do with legal status , socioeconomic status , or with being an immigrant or not . In high traffic areas , especially with high foot traffic dirtiness is always an issue , be it here or in FH , or in Fifth Ave. The only way to stop it is to clean it up with the help of people like the DOE fund. Which did clean in JH for a while and let me tell you 82nd st and parts of Roosevelt were spotless , until they left&nbsp; :( . So to blame any of these issues on factors like immigration is ridiculous.

I am in college with some people who come from a lot of money and not new money , old money . I have seen them spit their gum on the floor various time for example and a call them out about it and their answer is &quot; oh its doesn&#039;t matter its biodegradable&quot; bunch of crap pretty much&nbsp; :o and I have seen people do pretty gross things in affluent places , because the snob mentally exists unfortunately ,that someone has to pick up after you . This is not always the case but, anything and everything happens in all socioeconomic classes . When it comes to other cultures , this occurs as well . Funny thing is that all of these the people of the countries you mentioned are the ones that are blamed at least in some parts of the nabe for littering , other nationalities are also at flaw big time , and natives as well . Unfortunately , some people are judged as a whole due to nationality and it sucks and is unfair for them , some rotten apples always ruin it for the rest .&nbsp; When it come to how &quot;clean&quot; these countries are , well have you noticed how picky countries like Singapore are with their littering and spiting fines , they are on top of their game to maintain this level of &quot;cleanliness&quot; with heavy fines and penalties :police: . Unfortunately this is NYC , the city is not going to hire people to control this or enforce these laws; They SHOULD , imagine the killing they would make with that kind of money :rockon: , well that would be in an ideal NYC , but we can&#039;t all have what we want , it would be awesome if it were possible. Yes, it is sad that we need the DOE fund to keep clean , it sucks there can&#039;t be more me&#039;s or you&#039;s that do not litter but, that is the REALITY of the situation one faces in a big city&nbsp; :( <br />BTW , I may be young but, I have been exposed to a lot of cultures and a lot of things , but then again this is not about me , but, about JH and the problems it faces as a whole ;)

				APG7714,<br /><br />You are right about Singapore. &nbsp;It happened to have a high fine against littering. &nbsp; So Singapore might not be a good example.&nbsp; But&nbsp; there are many other countries that are clean not because of the fine, but people respect the public space. &nbsp;It is no doubt that the difference of standard exists in different countries and in different culture. A country is much poor than the other yet the streets are kept cleaner that the richer, also&nbsp; because of their cultural value. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Once you actually start going outside the US, you would probably understand it. &nbsp;

				When I lived in London, I was shocked at how often people littered on the street--everybody: kids, rich professionals, hipsters, working class... And I think it was because the city paid for a huge number of street sweepers to constantly patrol the streets and clean up after people. It wasn&#039;t a dirty city, but the people had the mentality that they could get away with it, that someone else would deal with it. I don&#039;t know if their behavior would change if all those street sweepers disappeared.<br /><br />Not that this applies to Roosevelt, where there are no street sweepers and people are blatant about littering. I&#039;ve seen moms tell their kids to drop trash on the ground when there&#039;s a can just a few feet away. I don&#039;t get it.

				LB that is not the reason in London.&nbsp; The reason is that the British had to do away with trash cans due to the IRA dropping bombs in them and killing civilians.&nbsp; Due to this, you have to throw your trash in the gutter but yes, they do have a huge patrol of street cleaners both manual and mechanical to clean up constantly.&nbsp; Still much cleaner than a lot of places with trash cans.
