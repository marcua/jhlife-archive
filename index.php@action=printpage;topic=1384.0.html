				What&#039;s with all of the apartments in Jackson Heights being built without overhead lighting in the living room?&nbsp; Weird.<br /><br />Once my living room windows stop getting direct sunlight it gets pretty dark.&nbsp; I have some lamps but they don&#039;t seem to cut it mainly in terms of wattage, but also in how they cast light.&nbsp; What do you guys do?

				Although I have been known to complain about this in the past, I have to say that I like the look of the living room without an overhead light fixture.&nbsp; Over the years, I&#039;ve used a floor lamp with a tilting head that provided a good amount of lighting to the area, and now I have two table lamps.&nbsp; The table lamps provide sufficient lighting for a cozy feeling.&nbsp; What really helps with the lighting issue though is that my living room is surrounded by a foyer and dining area that do have ceiling fixtures.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a few apartments where people have installed track or recessed lighting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen where people have just installed a strong hook with accompanying chain link on their ceiling and hung a lamp from that.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like that look because the electrical wire is threaded through the chain and then brought down along the wall making the wire visible.

				i have also been frustrated by rooms without a ceiling fixture.&nbsp; I have bought floor lamps that don&#039;t have a shade but are bowl shaped and they direct the light upward.&nbsp; That along with a floor or table lamp that can give you direct lighting seem to be one of the easier solutions.

				This is how living rooms were done at the time, localized lighting was the vogue. That&#039;s not only in JH but in many early 20th century buildings. <br /><br />If you&#039;re up for a larger project, you can get an electrician to wire for an overhead light. It will be a couple of hundred dollars or more, and then you&#039;re going to have to repaint, etc. Alternatively, you can get a plug-in overhead lamp but as Chuckster said, it is kinda ugly. A friend of mine installed wall lights (sconces and such) around the sitting areas because it gave her a more finished look. My issue with that is that you can&#039;t really change the space very much. <br /><br />I personally use my original living room as a study and have 4 table/floor lamps that give pretty good light.

				Thanks for the suggestions.<br /><br />I ended up getting a Staples desk lamp to put by my computer.&nbsp; Seems to have cut down on the eye strain.<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably end up buying some more floor lamps to complete the ensemble.<br />
