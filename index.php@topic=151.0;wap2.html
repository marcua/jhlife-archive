			Where: Flux Factory, Long Island City http://www.fluxfactory.org<br />Opens: Dec. 14 at 7pm<br /><br />See a preview of one of the pieces in the show here : http://www.marialevitsky.com/pages.php?content=news.php&amp;navGallID=News<br /><br />Imagine Coney Island&#039;s Dreamland, Steeplechase, and Luna Park reborn. Imagine a sea monster in the East River, a volcano erupting in Manhattan, Midtown in ruins. The contemporary brownstones of Cobble Hill buried beneath its original namesake hill, a big whale in the place of the Museum of Natural History, and The New York Crystal Palace returned to 42nd Street.<br /><br /><br />In short, a New York City that is the forgotten past and the fantastic future all at once. A New York City where anything is possible.<br /><br /><br />New York, New York, New York is an interactive, multimedia installation. It is a continuation of Flux Factory&#039;s interest in urban landscapes and takes inspiration from the Panorama, Robert Mosesâ€™ scale model of New York City in the Queens Museum of Art. Members of the Flux Factory art collective will work in collaboration with over 100 artists from all five boroughs and around the world to re-imagine the public and private spaces of New York.<br /><br /><br />Each artist will contribute a building, a landmark, a street, an avenue, a block, a park, a neighborhood, an expressway, a bridge, an island, an airportâ€”one or several elements of the urban environment. All of these individual works will be combined to produce a cohesive yet chaotic installation, a multimedia, scale-model of the city. Instead of being an exact replica to scale of the city of New York, this project offers a mental map, a replica of an imaginary New York. The goal of the show is to explore the architectural and conceptual elements of everyday space. It is an investigation into the collective unconscious of the cultural capital of the planet: The sum of all of New York&#039;s potential exposed in a great experiment in psychogeography.
