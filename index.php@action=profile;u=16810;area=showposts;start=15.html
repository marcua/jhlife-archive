					Agreed, theplanesland. I haven&#039;t seen any neighborhood cater to more high end tastes unless a) they&#039;d already pushed out the working class folks there or b) they were in the process of doing so. Lalochezia, you are talking about wine bars and organic produce, but I want to know why there can&#039;t be adequate services in a neighborhood (garbage pickup, responsive police and cleaning of graffiti) until neighborhood demographics change. Don&#039;t we all want those things, regardless of our income levels? <br /><br />That said, I would love to have more options for organic food in this area. Would also be nice to have the bars/restaurant options that Lalochezia mentioned so that I can walk and enjoy a drink instead of buying my craft brews in Astoria and drinking them at home.<br /><br />Things take time to develop and I&#039;m glad that we now have Addictive Wine Boutique and the new Arunee Thai in the area. Cannelle Patisserie is no Martha&#039;s, but it gets the job done when I don&#039;t feel like going to Astoria. I&#039;m sure that in time, others will take a chance on this neighborhood and find that it&#039;s a pretty nice place that supports a variety of interests and incomes.

					Great question. I&#039;d also like to know the answer as I&#039;m trying to sell my apartment and get a bigger space for my family. Much of JH seems to be beyond our budget :-(. We&#039;ve looked at places in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx and nowhere seems to match JH in terms of good schools, transit access (trains + thoroughfares for driving), and size of apartments (including architectural details!). We looked at Fieldston/Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx for a while, but since we can&#039;t pay up for private school, the lack of transit and expensive housing made it less than appealing. <br /><br />At this point we&#039;re pretty committed to staying in Queens. We checked out Ridgewood too, but...meh. Still on the hunt!

					At least it looks like the right people are talking about the issue. Maybe relief isn&#039;t far away.<br /><br />FIRST AIRPORT NOISE ROUNDTABLE IS HELD;RESIDENTS MEET WITH PORT AUTHORITY AND FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION<br />Queens Chronicle <br />by Laura A. Shepard, <br />For the first time in New York City history, representatives of the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey and the Federal Aviation Administration joined representatives from surrounding communities for a roundtable discussion on the noise and other impacts of flights arriving and departing from LaGuardia Airport, on Monday night. “Governor Andrew Cuomo made clear his concerns about aircraft noise in communities surrounding JFK and LaGuardia airports and that’s why we’re here tonight,” Ralph Tragale, the Port Authority assistant director of aviation, said. “He’s directed us to take some aggressive action.” The governor issued the executive order on March 24, almost a year and a half after Queens Quiet Skies formed to advocate on behalf of the people whose homes are bombarded with constant plane noise to the point where it was disrupting their conversations, activities, sleep and overall quality of life.<br />The first meeting was largely dedicated to presentations on the status of the airport itself and discussions about the functions of the roundtable and the direction it will take. <br /><br />At the moment, the schedule has not been determined and the members have yet to agree on bylaws.QQS President Janet McEneany laid out the basics. Some core tenets are that roundtable members must represent entities or groups with a stake in aviation, operate under written bylaws signed by all members (except the FAA, which is barred by federal statute) and follow a work-plan to address specific issues in committees, McEneany said.“Roundtable members — this is a very important principle — they agree that we will not shift noise from one community to another,” McEneany said. “Roundtables all over the United States have found ways to get rid of the noise.”Queens Quiet Skies recommended forming one roundtable for both JFK and LaGuardia Airports, but the Port Authority chose to form two, one for each airport, but Tragale said that if there are many overlapping issues and the members of both groups support it, the Port Authority will consider consolidating the two.<br /><br />Roe Dario of the COMET Civic Association also supported one roundtable as communities like Maspeth are subject to noise from both airports, she said.The Port Authority and the FAA are adding staffers and hiring consultants to conduct a three-year, $3 million study of noise impacts and possible mitigation measures.The Port Authority is doubling its noise monitoring program and will work with the roundtable members to find locations for the new ones, especially in communities that currently do not have any. If more are necessary, the Port Authority will add them. There are permanent noise monitors at the end of runways so that the Port Authority can inform the airlines when their departing planes violate noise limits and portable monitors in surrounding communities, which look like mini fridges with a microphone atop a tall pole that must be placed in otherwise quiet residential areas.<br />The roundtable will also ease communications between the communities and the agencies, as there has been a lot of confusion in the past, since the Port Authority operates the airports, but the FAA dictates flight patterns.<br />“There was always a lot of misunderstanding about what the airport operator does and what the FAA does,” Tragale said. “Sometimes they were at a meeting, sometimes we were at a meeting and people felt they were getting the runaround. This meeting does a lot to establish that we’re both going to be here and you can respond to both of us equally in front of each other so there can’t be any finger-pointing.”<br />The Port Authority also revamped its website to make it easier for people to register complaints by simply typing in their address and hitting a complaint icon. This will enable the Port Authority to compile data over time and make appropriate changes.<br />Rosemary Povoromo of the United Community Civic Association was also there on behalf of several politicians and expressed her hope that the roundtables “will not just be venting sessions to tranquilize the masses.<br />“LaGuardia Airport is our immediate noisy neighbor and we who live in northwestern Queens have suffered its ongoing assault on our quality of life for decades, not only from heart-pounding, earsplitting noise from the thousands of arriving and departing jetliners, but from jet fumes belched from its thunderous engines and both these assaults must be coupled when addressing airport negatives and both if at all possible must be neutralized,” Povoromo said.<br />“We don’t run these airports to detract from the quality of life, we do it to improve the quality of life,” Tragale said. “The airports are a very important economic generator, the airports provide a lot of jobs and a lot of economic benefit to the city, but it’s very important to us that they be good neighbors and I think we’ve made a lot of progress over the years, but we obviously have some work left to do and that’s why we’re starting these roundtables.”<br /><a href="http://www.qchron.com/editions/western/first-airport-noise-roundtable-is-held/article_e643e780-ffef-5a1e-8f8c-fc5a8956e828.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qchron.com/editions/western/first-airport-noise-roundtable-is-held/article_e643e780-ffef-5a1e-8f8c-fc5a8956e828.html</a><br />

					This should be interesting. I love bubble tea, but not the ones made from powders...which is most of the bubble tea in the area. Ten Ren is one of the few that doesn&#039;t use powder. Here&#039;s to hoping that Brothers is also not powder-based!

					It&#039;s not just the extra cars or even foot traffic, although that&#039;s part of it. It&#039;s the usage of infrastructure and resources. The fact that parking isn&#039;t included doesn&#039;t stop people from buying cars if they feel that they need one. They just buy a car and hope that it works out (e.g. Park Slope- every so often they talk about doing residential parking permits to overcome the parking shortage, but mostly people just scream about the lack of parking). Hopefully the extension of the 7 will help with subway crowding, but you never know. My biggest issue is garbage. More people in an area always means more garbage. Hopefully it will be properly disposed of and not end up as litter or more dog poop on the streets. <br /><br />Maybe none of this will be a problem with the addition of just one building. But if we start having multiple new buildings in the area, these issues could be real.

					I&#039;m not sure about JH...I&#039;m also looking for one in JH, but in the meantime, I have had phenomenal results with Oak Point Therapy in Astoria. It&#039;s about $85 for the hour, but I would gladly pay more because they are just that good!

					I think it&#039;s mostly for the area residents/workers. I don&#039;t think it will change my commute at all.<br /><br />Although I live closer to the 7 at 82nd than I do 74th Street, I rarely take the 7. I&#039;ve found that it&#039;s usually faster to go to 74th Street and take the express trains into Manhattan. If 74th-Roosevelt ever becomes a 7 Express train stop, that might be helpful for the commute into/out of Manhattan. I&#039;m surprised that it&#039;s not already an express stop, considering that it&#039;s a transit hub for the area.<br /><br /><br />

					I think that any discussion on traffic violations must also include an honest look at pedestrian behavior. I take the Q32 &amp; Q33 at least 1x/day. On any given day, at least one person will cross AGAINST the light in front of the bus I&#039;m on. This is especially egregious on Roosevelt and on 82nd between 37th &amp; Roosevelt. This morning, an old woman actually smiled at the bus driver as she put her hand up and crossed in front the bus. The bus was packed--- people were standing in the stepwell. We couldn&#039;t have been going more than 20mph, but the driver still had to brake in the middle of traffic for this woman. Cameras and reduced speed limits will not curb this reckless pedestrian behavior.

					I may be the only dissenter here, but I don&#039;t think we need 20mph streets outside of school areas. I might be wrong, but I think that all the school streets in JH already have speed bumps/reduced speed zones. I agree with Superclam---the bigger issues are people who skip red lights and stop signs, and cut off pedestrians while turning. Reducing speeds won&#039;t do anything to change that behavior. Many times, people aren&#039;t blowing through the stop signs/red lights/turns at high speed. They just coast through.

					Welcome to the neighborhood PNG and Minimal4Me! <br /><br />Minimal, I think Blink will do really well here. I like the crack of dawn gym classes I take in Astoria, but it is definitely nice to have another option :-). It&#039;s been a long time coming.
