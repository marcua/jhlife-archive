				Who defends not cleaning up after their dogs? In my 30 years of JH and Forest Hills living experience, and I&#039;ve had lots of interactions with dog owners, I&#039;ve not once encountered a defense of their illegal act. It&#039;s always a I&#039;m sorry, or, no bag, or I forgot, oops. Btw, are you the poop monitor of FH?&nbsp; Because I think it&#039;s an equal opportunity for lazyness, and self entitlement, no matter where you live. And part of the charm? Not so much.

				I got fed up with my neighbor&#039;s teen who never picked up their dog&#039;s poop. Finally, I caught him in the act and asked him to pick it up. He said he didn&#039;t have a bag so I gave him one. He looked horrified but I stood there and stared at him until he picked it up and then asked him to explain to me why he thought that the rules didn&#039;t apply to him. He didn&#039;t have an answer and seemed pretty embarrassed. The next time I saw him he had a bag with him!&nbsp; Public shaming worked for once (and I was polite when speaking with him which I think helped).&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The burb-ers don&#039;t clean up after their dogs any better than the urbanites. FM and BS have grassy areas for the dogs to go in, and the citizenry, who are in their cars, not walking block after block, don&#039;t encounter it. The problem in JH is fences. The dogs relieve themselves on our walkways.

				It is so bad that I find myself looking down all the time&nbsp; as I am walking. I am a dog owner and all my dogs have bag dispensers attached to their leashes. There is no excuse! Yesterday I went to the CVS on Northern in the 70&#039;s and noticed that the patch of grass in the back is filled to the rim with crap!! There are many blocks in the 80&#039;s that are quite bad as well.&nbsp; I also hate it when owners leave their dogs run loose, go on private property, crap and pee and run back home. I see it all the time on my block and let them have it.

The scoop law, even though it&#039;s not really enforced, has gone a long way toward improving our quality of life in the neighborhood. It used to look like a public toilet on the sidewalks. <br />We&#039;ve still got a ways to go. To me, not picking up after your dog means you&#039;re not qualified to be a dog owner. Is the dog supposed to pick up after itself? <br />However, we need more places for dog walkers to dispose of the waste. No one seems to bring the waste back to their home to flush. Disposing of the bags in public waste baskets only adds to the unique aroma of the commercial district. Some of the co-ops used to have plastic garbage bags out for dog walkers to&nbsp; use, but I don&#039;t see them so much these days.<br />Unfortunately, the homeless problem in our neighborhood also means that some of what you see in the morning is not to be blamed on dogs.<br />But still much better than back in the day.

				Glad to see a thread on this...people not picking up dog poop is one of my pet peeves about living in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I have confronted some dog owners about this...they need to be shamed. Some streets continue to be really bad...84th Street is one of them.&nbsp; Every morning dodging dog poop and hoping not to step in it coming back at night is frustrating and may drive me to leave JH.&nbsp; It seems all types do this.&nbsp; I do think more people need to speak up when they see this and confront people who do this.&nbsp; I shamed one elderly man, and I think I now see him picking up his dog&#039;s poop.&nbsp; <br /><br />Catching up on Season 1 of Billions, I loved this dog poop scene clip where a man is made to pick it up with his hands.&nbsp; No excuse not having a bag.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMiwgQTTQTc

				Those people who do not pick up make it bad for all us dog owners. I get yelled at when my dog IS NOT EVEN DONE POPPING!&nbsp; Some people need to wait until they see that I am going to pick it up!&nbsp; - they have no right to yell at me before anything happens! - Ive been picking up poop for 16 yrs now. <br /><br />Poop and SPIT are nasty. <br />

				So glad for this thread bc I bitch and moan about this very topic every single day! My teen daughter has used garbage she found in the floor to pick up our dog’s poop when he surprised us with a 2nd poop during the same walk and we ran out of bags. Our dog shouldn’t be other people’s problems! I can’t ever walk with my head up Bc I’m so scared of stepping in some crap! I also have to pull and drag my pup so he doesn’t step I. Then either! I once told a young kid to take a poop bag bc he was walking away from his dog’s GINORMOUS poop and he “pshawed” me and walked away even faster. I wish I had my phone on me so I can take a photo! I was sooo angry bc his dog is the one who leaves horse poop size mounds and I don’t even think he lives on my block!!!

				back when i lived in a private house here, we had a fire hydrant in front of the house. that encouraged dogs to pee. fine. that&#039;s one of the main reasons those hydrants are there. but it also encouraged them to poop. also fine, if the walker cleaned up. if i was outside and saw someone walking away, i&#039;d offer them one&nbsp; of the scattered ad circulars to clean up. that almost always worked, with grumbling.one time, a young woman told me to f-off, and left, so i picked up the mess and followed from a safe distance, until she got to her home, where i left the crap on her doorstep.

				Hey I am a dog lover and have a furry friend and we hate seeing poop on the ground especially during winter snow storms it’s like there is an excuse to leave the poop on the dirty snow and when it rains all the dog’s bowel systems goes bonkers and owners decide to not pick up, ugh!!! I hadn’t actually spotted a person who hasn’t picked up the poop but that’s what will make JH better! I will make sure to carry extra bags!
