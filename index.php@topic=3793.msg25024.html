								<div class="inner" id="msg_24785">As&nbsp; I understand it, and in all fairness this is unsubstantiated. Monserrate was being discharged from the NYPD and played the race card. The compromise seems to have been discharging him on the basis of a psychological disability which allowed him to retain his pension / benefits and probably gave him a tidy pay out, which no doubt funded his City Council bid. So the psychological discharge was likely BS, however he clearly has psychological problems. But when you look at the history of many of our state politicians, he seems to fit right in. </div>

He said he froze the funds when the director became ill two years ago.<br /><br />Without naming names, Peralta accused the story of being planted by his political enemies.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m as transparent as can be,&quot; Peralta said. &quot;The organizations that I have helped throughout the year are as transparent as can be and we are going to continue fighting because the real issue here is I have an opponent who has created a stain on this community.&quot;<br /><br />The Democrat is challenging Senator Hiram Monserrate in a primary.<br /><br />Monserrate was convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse charges in October and was sentenced to community service and ordered to receive counseling and pay a fine.</div>

The compromise seems to have been discharging him on the basis of a psychological disability which allowed him to retain his pension / benefits and probably gave him a tidy pay out, which no doubt funded his City Council bid. So the psychological discharge was likely BS, however he clearly has psychological problems.

								<div class="inner" id="msg_24838"><img src="http://www.queenstribune.com/sitegraphics/Title.gif" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />From Queens Tribune: <a href="http://www.queenstribune.com/news/News_Assemblyman.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenstribune.com/news/News_Assemblyman.html</a><br />by Brian Rafferty 12/03/09<br /><br />In June 2004, Assemblyman Jose Peralta (D-Corona) secured a $125,000 grant to create the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development, an organization designed to be the clearinghouse for ACCION, NY, a micro-loan organization established to help seed business in low-income areas, as well as other local banks.<br /><br />The agency was an apparent success; in November 2005 the group was awarded $250,000 in a federal appropriations bill earmark from Sen. Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley (D-Jackson Heights). â€œThis federal funding is a shot in the arm for the economy in the Corona-Elmhurst district and will help fledgling businesses mature into vibrant enterprises,â€ Schumer said at the time. â€œThe Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development is instrumental in revitalizing the communityâ€™s economy, and, with this money, it will lead the charge in training and financing local businesses.â€<br /><br />An article in the Daily News this week, however, attempted to paint the Assemblymanâ€™s relationship with the agency in a negative light. The agency reduced its operations in 2006 when its executive director fell ill, and by 2007 the funds previously earmarked for the agency were frozen pending a restructuring of the organization, according to a statement issued Thursday by Peralta.<br /><br />â€œFor over three years, the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development served hundreds of Queens families and helped scores of local businesses succeed,â€ Peralta wrote in a statement. â€œIt received funding from my office, from the State Senate and from the federal government.â€<br /><br />Peralta was not available to speak in a phone interview for this story on Thursday.<br /><br />The Daily News reporter had attempted to link Peraltaâ€™s campaign office, his mother and the owner of the building that housed the center through a series of unrelated data, which Peraltaâ€™s spokesman said seemed to be designed to confuse the reader.<br /><br />Peraltaâ€™s campaign office is located in the building and received in-kind donations on Peraltaâ€™s Campaign Finance statements from his mother for the rent on the office. Peralta was unavailable to answer questions about any relationship his campaign or his family may have had with the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development, which is a registered non-profit, but did not have any tax filings on record through a popular non-profit public record clearinghouse, guidestar.org.<br /><br />A spokesman from Peraltaâ€™s campaign said he would attempt to find out the details of the agencyâ€™s non-profit IRS filings, but was unable to get them by press time.<br /><br />Peralta, meanwhile, labels the entire story as a hit piece generated by Sen. Hiram Monserrate (D-Corona), whom Peralta is challenging in a primary for the Democratic line in next yearâ€™s State Senate race.<br /><br />â€œNeither me nor anyone in my family has any financial connection to the Center,â€ Peraltaâ€™s statement read. â€œThis is all part of Hiram Monserrateâ€™s dirty bag of tricks to confuse his constituentsâ€¦ He shamefully wants to change the subject and obscure the fact that he is an abuser and unfit to hold office.â€<br /><br />Coincidentally, Monserrate had earmarked $47,500 in funding for the current year budget for the Audubon Partnership for Economic Development, which is attempting to get the Corona-Elmhurst agency back on its feet, noting that the funding â€œwill cover the cost of remodelingâ€¦in order to serve the community in the greatest capacity.â€</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_25018">Well folks here we go again.&nbsp; <br />Now the Queens Tribune on a front page story reports that good ole JOSE PERALTA might not have been as honest as he originally stated.&nbsp; The FACTS are that he illegally reported campaign contributions as donations from his mother!!&nbsp; Thats right the idiot put his mother in the middle of a corruption scandal.&nbsp; You see both Jose&#039;s camapign office and his not for profit are in the same buliding the not for profit with our tax dollars paid rent to Ms. Mota who by the way lives with his mother Ms. Hernandez.&nbsp; Ms. Mota in turn gave Jose free rent on his campaign office!!!&nbsp; Hmmmmm. Quid Pro Quo??&nbsp; I think an arrest is iminent.&nbsp; Read the facts folks&nbsp; Just the facts.&nbsp; Me thinks we need a new turd, this one (Jose) smells too bad!<br /><br /><strong>From Today&#039;s Queens Tribune</strong><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><strong>False Report:<br />Peralta Got $17,900 In Excess Funds,<br />Admits To Bad Election Filings</strong></div><br />By Kaitlyn Kilmetis<br /><br /><br />Assemblyman Jose Peralta (D-Corona) admitted this week that he filed donations for his previous Assembly runs inaccurately, and has been working to clear up the records. <br /><br />Between 2005 and 2006, Peralta listed some 23 donations for $1,300 apiece as coming from his mother, Rosa Hernandez, who works as an office manager for a family friend, Mercedes Mota-Martinez. <br /><br />104-01 Roosevelt Realty, an LLC owned by Mota-Martinez, owns the building at 104-01 Roosevelt Ave., where Peraltaâ€™s campaign is headquartered. The donations were not Hernandezâ€™s to make as the space being donated belongs to the LLC.<br /><br />The difference between a donation made by a family member and anyone else is extreme â€“ private individuals and corporations are limited to $3,800 in donations for the primary and general elections, while family member donations are figured out by a formula; the max is never less than $12,500 for both the primary and general elections. <br /><br />Peralta received $29,900 in donations originally tagged as from his mother over the course of two campaign cycles â€“ for the 2004 and 2006 campaigns. <br /><br />As a result, Peraltaâ€™s campaign was able to receive $17,900 more than what the law allows. Peralta admitted in a conversation this week that his campaign filings were incorrect, but was unavailable to answer later questions, specifically, if he had listed the filings under his motherâ€™s name as a way to skirt around the donation limits established by the Board of Elections. <br /><br />A spokesman later said his mother was listed as the donor because she sits on the board of directors for the LLC. The spokesman said this was â€œan honest mistakeâ€ and that as of Dec. 11 the LLC has been reimbursed the $17,900 and that the amended filing has been recorded and documented. <br /><br />The Board of Elections confirmed that on Dec. 14, Peralta filed a number of amendments to the campaign finance records to switch the donor from his mother to the 104-01 Roosevelt Realty Corporation. As of publication, there are now only eight such donations for a total of $12,000. <br /><br />Peralta said that in the future he will have an election lawyer review all the documents his campaign files.<br /><br />John Conklin, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said filing adjustments years after a campaign is neither typical or atypical. He said making alterations to the records is encouraged because the ultimate goal is accurate filing. <br /><br />In his campaign records from his 2008 election, rather than receive the rent as a donation, Peralta began making cash payments for $1,300. He said although the 104-01 corporation offered to donate the space, he chose to make payments because the election was more relaxed than his 2006 run against Carmen Enriquez. <br /><br />Shared Space <br />The issue of Peraltaâ€™s campaign records was first raised in a New York Daily News article about Peralta and the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development. <br /><br />On Dec. 9, columnist Juan Gonzalez wrote that Peralta requested more than $500,000 in taxpayer funds for a nonprofit organization that is inactive and has been for defunct for at least the past two years. <br /><br />Peralta, who aided in developing the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development early in his Assembly tenure, vehemently disputes the articleâ€™s claims and attempted to set the record straight. <br /><br />The location of the Corona-Elmhurst Center is the same building owned by Mota-Martinezâ€™s LLC, and where Perlataâ€™s campaign office is housed. Peralta, who helped get the group started, said the companyâ€™s CEO found the space on his own and he had no part in determining the location of the Center.<br /><br />At one point, Peralta, Hernandez and Mota-Martinez all lived in the same multi-dwelling home in Corona â€“ Hernandez and Peralta in one apartment and Mota-Martinez in another. Although the Daily News article states the two both currently live together, Peralta said his mother has since moved to a home in East Elmhurst â€“ a dwelling which is co-owned by Mota-Martinez. He said Mota-Martinez still lives in the Corona building. <br /><br />Prior to the Corona-Elmhurst Center taking space in the building, Peralta paid monthly rent of $1,300. During the time that Peraltaâ€™s motherâ€™s business partner benefited from the new rent-paying tenant, the Corona-Elmhurst Center, Perlata was given the in-kind donations. After the Corona-Elmhurst Center moved out, Peralta started paying rent once again. <br /><br />He said the fact he began paying rent had nothing to do with the fact the Corona-Elmhurst Center had shut down.<br /><br />The Money Trail <br />On top of the rental question, a separate issue of the funding for the agency has also been raised. <br /><br />Peralta said in 2003 he was approached by Fernando Fernandez â€“ who had a background in nonprofit organizations with an emphasis on development groups â€“ about his plans for a development center for the area. Peralta said he was attracted to the nonprofit, the Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development, because bringing a voice to the small business community was a platform issue throughout his campaign. <br /><br />According to the Assemblyman, after being presented a comprehensive business plan by Fernandez, who was named Executive Director, in 2003 Peralta earmarked $125,000 for the organization to begin. Then, for the next three years, from 2004 through 2006, Peralta secured increments of $125,000 each year for the center, totaling another $375,000. <br /><br />Peralta said the first $250,000 was dispersed successfully by the organization through computer classes, business seminars and a variety of community services.<br /><br />As the organization flourished, Peralta said Fernandez fell ill and required a kidney transplant. In 2006, he approached Peralta and said due to his deteriorating health, he was not sure how effectively he could continue to run the organization. Immediately after, Peralta said he approached the Assemblyâ€™s Ways and Means Committee in order to put a freeze on the $250,000 earmarked in 2005 and 2006.<br /><br />Also, in 2005 U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer secured $250,000 in federal funds for the centerâ€™s development.<br /><br />This week, the Senatorâ€™s spokesman Josh Vlasto said, â€œThe federal money was never drawn down and, as the grant has since expired, we have asked the SBA to redirect the funds.â€<br /><br />In terms of state funding, Peralta maintains that the first $250,000 the state supplied was dispersed and the other $250,000 remains untouched to this day.<br /><br />He added that as an assemblyman his job description includes earmarking the funds, but each assembly project is administered by a state agency. In this case, that agency was the State Dept. of Economic Development.<br /><br />Through a popular non-profit public record clearinghouse, guidestar.org, Corona-Elmhurst Center for Economic Development did not have any tax filings on record.<br /><br />Behind The Scenes <br />Peralta, who is staging a Senate race against Sen. Hiram Monserrate (D-Corona), said he believes the entire Daily News story is a hit piece staged by the Senator to distract from the pertinent issues. <br /><br />â€œThis is a classic smear campaign tactic that needs to end,â€ Peralta said. â€œThis is one of the reasons why I am running.â€ He continued that the pieceâ€™s reporter seems to habitually sing Monserrateâ€™s praises. <br /><br />â€œThe facts speak for themselves,â€ Peralta said. â€œEvery time there was a positive article about Hiram Monserrate in the Daily News it was Juan Gonzalez that wrote it. Let the readers make the judgment.â€<br /><br />Gonzalez declined to respond to Peraltaâ€™s claim.<br /><br />When Monserrateâ€™s office was contacted for comment, one of the Senatorâ€™s staffers answered the phone and said he had already been made aware, via Juan Gonzalez, that the Tribune was investigating the story. <br /><br />Gonzalez would not substantiate that assertion. <br /><br />The employee then introduced the Tribune to the source that had given information to the Daily News â€“ an Elmhurst author, who asked to remain unnamed. He said he has been gathering information about the Peralta situation for the past seven years.<br /><br />He said as an investigative journalist he researches the campaigns and actions of many Queens officials as a service to his community. The author assured he had no link to Monserrate and investigates all borough politicians.<br /><br />Upon further research, it was ascertained that through personal contributions and donations from businesses the author operates, the unnamed source contributed large amounts to the campaign of Peraltaâ€™s 2006 opponent Carmen Enriquez. Campaign finance records also list the source and Enriquez as having the same address, including apartment number.<br /><br />Enriquezâ€™ campaign spending reports state that the unnamed source and the businesses he owns received a total of $600, in consulting, printing and office space fees, from the 2006 campaign. <br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_25024">Tony T, do you have any new turds in mind?&nbsp; <br /><br />I noticed when you joined JHL on November 3, you were calling for &quot;anything but Dems and Repubs&quot; and I&#039;m curious who you would support, since there is still time to find a 3rd party candidate, or better challengers to Monserrate within the Democratic Party. For example, are you looking at right-leaning parties, left, or crank candidates or boutique ones? I don&#039;t disagree with your basic premise (that politicians as a class are quite odious--something I would say of my own profession, teachers, btw), but wonder if you have any ideas or alternatives. Sometimes it feels like we have no options and are always choosing the lesser of the &quot;two evils.&quot; Since moving to Jackson Heights in 2006, I&#039;ve been happy to find folks like Dromm and Peralta who are receptive to input from the community. They seem ever-present to me. I always see Peralta on 37th Avenue and unlike some other people, he doesn&#039;t always travel like some thug with an entourage. <br /><br />My union is considering adding &quot;access&quot; to the criteria, like voting records, when making endorsements (and therefore contributions). I&#039;ve found these two (Dromm and Peralta) to be much better than what I was used to, and we alll know about Sears and her terrible record on constituent services. I&#039;m sure Dromm is putting into place a strong community function, something Sears couldn&#039;t do given that her backers were not members of the community.<br /><br />IN ANY EVENT,<br />I&#039;d like to call the question, and so given the choice between Monserrate and Peralta, I&#039;ll put my chips in with Mr. Peralta. If he&#039;s guilty of a crime, I&#039;ll go sing carols outside his cell block. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to be necessary, LOL, so your hyperbole, &quot;I think an arrest is iminent (sic)&quot; seems oddly partisan. If it&#039;s not, fine...<br /><br />Given the choice, would you back Monserrate over Peralta? It would be useful to know when reading your future posts, since Mr. Monserrate&#039;s crimes are already proven while even constructing <span class="bbc_u">allegations</span> against Mr. Peralta out of innuendo and shady &quot;investigative reporting&quot; is extremely premature. If you read the article without the angle you already brought to the table you might, like Shelby2 apparently, and me, at least, find something else stinks here and it isn&#039;t Mr. Peralta. In that first post of yours, you suggest there is evidence to be found in campaign filings. So, given that statement, and these new allegations, care to break any news here? Seems like you know something the authorities don&#039;t, and so I, as an &quot;investigative reporter&quot; myself, would love to interview you, on the record or off...<br /></div>
