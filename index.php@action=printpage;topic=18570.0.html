				Hello again, Bob; I&#039;m the yoga teacher, former dancer living in 3F. We met in the elevator a few times and your daughter said she knows the work of my son, who&#039;s a film-maker and former actor. My other son is a musician working and schlepping around the country with his synthesizer ...hard work but he&#039;s good at it. <br />I&#039;m sorry I missed your concert on Wednesday but I was teaching. As I told Alli, I teach Yoga/Pilates etc. for NY Sports Club but not in Queens. I&#039;d like to find teaching work here, especially private coaching in people&#039;s homes (or mine) as I did in the city for the past 35 years. Perhaps you and Alli could come down for a glass of wine some time, when we&#039;re not all working or doing laundry! <br />I just joined JHLife tonight, as I didn&#039;t know about it; I don&#039;t know anyone in JH yet, having recently moved in. But someone told me about it today and I answered a post who asked about living here years ago. I lived here in the Very Early 50&#039;s and went to PS 89, not 69. Not sure why! My father was the local Woodside doctor, a Romanian immigrant. We were the only Jewish family on our Woodside street and I always wanted to go to St Sebastian and wear pretty communion dresses like all the girls on my block. We moved to a semi-attached house on 89th st from Woodside and I loved the intellectual and cultural life I had here. My parents, typical of immigrants then and now, moved to a &quot;better&quot; area when I was in 8th grade (Jamaica Estates, which I detested) and I never had the same quality of friends after that until I went to HS Performing Arts in Manhattan. <br /><br />So this is my first foray into Queens as an adult and I&#039;m relishing all of it (except for the Con Ed folks outside my window right now at 2am). I have a very noisy toddler above me who runs for 2-3 hours each evening when she returns from wherever they take her for the day, and all day weekends. So I escape a lot when she&#039;s home. Sigh...the Office won&#039;t take a stand or even ask them to put down rugs.<br /><br />OK, sorry to ramble. That&#039;s what one does at this hour, I reckon.&nbsp; Hope to meet you and Alli again soon (on purpose, this time).<br /><br /><br />Gregg Mayer (Ms)
