					Frankly, I&#039;m not surprised by the outcome here. Justice Erlbaum clearly followed a kind of plausible (if offensive) reading of the law and the facts (as presented) in the case. I think another outcome might have been had if the judge had been from another jurisdiction, since I think that this is also a political decision rendered by a judge who, by all accounts, sees himself as part of the community. That we&#039;re stuck with a dead baby (a disgraced, impotent, State Senator) is some measure of the price we pay for this very political decision. If he is not guilty of attacking his girlfriend with a broken glass, but only of dragging her down the stairs and out the door of his building, then I&#039;m sure he will be increasing his support for victims of domestic abuse and for programs to educate young men on how to handle their emotions. &quot;Happens all the time&quot; my students say of domestic abuse. &nbsp;&quot;Happens all the time?&quot; We cannot allow this to seem normal or natural.<br /><br />I wish Karla Giraldo could be prosecuted for perjuring herself on the stand. I hope she never has to experience such a brutal assault again, and I also hope that no young women saw what she did as a possible path for themselves. &nbsp;I know that as an educator in the public university system, I vow to make this topic a central concern of my practice for the duration of my career. In the meantime, I&#039;ll be out on the streets urging for an alternative to Hiram Monserrate for State Senate. <br /><br />

					I thought it was for Thursday, but perhaps I&#039;ve got it wrong. I should have copied down the information. But I didn&#039;t see anything about 37th ave, so perhaps that&#039;s something different. The same production? Well if you wake up tomorrow and your car is gone--it&#039;s Wednesday.

					I saw signs on 80th, North of Northern (a district I&#039;m now calling &quot;NONO&quot;) that the new HBO comedy series &quot;How to Make it in America&quot; (a Mark Wahlberg production, apparently) is set to film in the neighborhood on Thursday.&nbsp; The locations were both sides of Northern from 80-83, and in the 78-79 area near 31st Ave (approximately). <br /><br />I looked into this show, having hopes for a serious treatment about immigrants and worried that they might be featuring JH and East Elmhurst (that is, that the show would be set there). What was I thinking?&nbsp; It&#039;s about two twenty-something hipsters (marshmellows, if you believe Gothamist) in their quest to &quot;make it&quot; and the various hijinks they pull to succeed. The description I read somewhere used the word &quot;hustle&quot; but I&#039;m sure they meant &quot;adventure.&quot; <br /><br />Anyhow, for your information.

					I read somewhere that John Liu&#039;s campaign was going to be fined for its illegal postering during the election season, and that it&#039;s a per-offense penalty. I can&#039;t find the article now and yet that&#039;s not why I&#039;m writing here.<br /><br />I noticed postering on the poles on 79th &amp; 37th Ave -- &quot;Donate your Car&quot; it reads -- apparently a non-profit. While I&#039;ve called 311 about that, and you might too (if it bothers you; I was mostly calling to find out the rule but did, in fact complain), I also asked about the postering on cars.&nbsp; This has come up here before, with, I think, the general consensus that this fell to the 115th Precinct and that they really don&#039;t care about this.<br /><br />So... I don&#039;t blame them.<br /><br />However, I did call Innovative Vision Care and suggest that they run around and pick up the flyers that were distributed overnight on every car in the neighborhood. I notified them of the law. Their number is 718-424-5500.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather not get them in trouble, so I didn&#039;t file a complain and the nice woman who answered the phone was unaware of the law and that the penalty for it was per-instance.... (You&#039;ll note that John Liu&#039;s fine--if actually handed down--would amount to well into 6 figures)...<br /><br />Anyhow, give them a call and encourage them, as I did, to send an employee out, on this beautiful Autumn day, to pick up all that trash.<br /><br />If this is something that bothers you, lets run a little blacklist here. If you like it, and appreciate the advertising, call them to let them know that, too, and perhaps you might take some business there.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />

					Chuckster,<br /><br />Their reading about all this here raises the stakes, I think. Not because seeing the questions in advance will harm the process (though that may be the case in some kinds of fora or those seeking particular results) but because they can watch this unfold and simply stand idly by. The JHL crowd risks appearing weak, in my estimation, and while members of this forum may be involved otherwise (as I am), we risk losing the action-oriented aspect of this social network. Pouvoir, or potencia.<br /><br />Personally, I like your question and think that it demonstrates how having time to think it over, and develop a response, may not be such a bad thing. I, personally, am not trying to trip anyone up by surprising them--and I think that we probably need to do all we can to make it fair and even. Certainly, they all have an answer to your question--I think that it&#039;s a great question since it will allow each to say what they want. You are right, I think, in that the way they answer, as well as temperament, how it varies, and our reception of it, is what the real story will be.&nbsp; I could predict what some of the answers will be like, as we&#039;ve largely heard it all before. However, I think that having it in writing will allow us to engage with it meaningfully and also to &quot;stick to the facts&quot; of what each candidate proposes. Too often in political rhetoric words, meanings, and ideas at their biggest become &quot;plastic&quot; in that they can come to mean a variety of things, and the genius of spin is being able to ride (when not dictate) the cheesy ambiguity it invokes. Remember the &quot;meaning of is?&quot; not to mention the legion of Bush policies that read like a middle school book report on a glossary of Orwellian new speak. The ability to parse what is said and connect it to reality -- or not -- is our job as members of the community. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s important that this forum, as a kind of fifth estate, be used to hold elected officials, and those running for office, accountable to us here--just as constituencies organized by other means (tenants or homeowners, business owners, residents, as well as those organized by profession, identity, etc.) are able to leverage their status in the community to get a response, not to mention whatever dispensation they are able to garner. I don&#039;t think that any of the candidates would dare ignore any of the major constituent groups in the neighborhood, and I think that we should begin the process of activating our, ahem, potencia, err, our pouvoir, to be less anglo saxon about it...<br /><br />Here is another question, and I&#039;ll just start rewriting the questions as summaries of what&#039;s been discussed here.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some issues... What are candidates going to about:<br /><br />1. Trash in the street/neighbhorhood.&nbsp; Obviously, this is just a list, but should they be more question-oriented?<br />2. Traffic, especially congestion, noise, honking (this is actually a whole forum, not a question but it seems like the Transportation Study already underway will involve some integrated solutions and possible compromises.&nbsp; Here is something:&nbsp; What compromises does candidate-X feel that various stakeholders should be willing to make that the candidate-X is willing to propose.<br />3. Hate-crime and speech. This is an ongoing problem, as has been noted with the violent attacks on Leslie Mora, as well as the Sikh man some months ago. <br />4. ? and so on... this is just a very quick list.&nbsp; If any are worth keeping, please modify by restating them in some manner...&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; we need more than just this so we can drop some, combine and/or split others...<br /><br />Your thoughts?<br />

					So, enough people have seen this thread and response has been underwhelming.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Let me try a couple things here, so hang with me...<br /><br />First off, I read the Astorians&#039; thread. They did their meeting in a live format apparently. There is no sense of how it turned out at least not on that thread. Perhaps later someone reported on it, but I didn&#039;t go look to see... Does anyone know? <br /><br />We&#039;re obviously not able to do something live. Not in August, and not with a little over a month to go. Also, I have my suspicions that the campaigns would probably not respond. All of them do read JHL, and we&#039;ve already heard Stanley&#039;s presence is mediated by a family member. If not true, no one has spoken up here to discount that notion. I&#039;m concerned that there may be no Helen Sears supporters here on JHL. Is that possible? Please say it ain&#039;t so! I was hoping to hear some good arguments on her behalf. <br /><br />Another thing I learned from the Astorians project as linked-to above is that it was really the work of a small group of people. So, perhaps that&#039;s what we need. Anyone want to help? Please say something. <br /><br />Something else: it might be easier to present the questions in person and &quot;record&quot; the results, interview style. This might be the easiest thing for the candidates and since we can claim that the &quot;audience&quot; for this project is the JHL community, I think they&#039;d be pretty hard-pressed to blow-off answering our questions. Am I wrong? Does anyone here have contact with Helen Sears or her staff? I am afraid that I&#039;ll just come back here upset if I have trouble getting through to her/them. Danny Dromm and Stanley Kalathara are accessible and I&#039;m confident that they will be willing to be interviewed, though I&#039;ve not asked them directly.<br /><br />Here is a question I&#039;d like to ask each of the candidates-- I&#039;ll post others but this is to get the ball rolling. <br /><br />QUESTION:<br />An issue in this campaign has been the role of communication in the area of constituent services. Rather than worry about the past, lets talk about the future. As a member of the New York City Council, what would you do to improve the communications between your office and those seeking redress for their concerns? How, specifically, do you see the role of newer technologies in achieving those ends?<br /><br /><br />/endquestion<br />So.... that&#039;s a pretty rough take on a question... <br />I think it needs some work, the terms of which may be obvious to all of us...&nbsp; I think it&#039;s an important two-part question; part2 seems slanted against 80 year old Sears, but this is why people have a staff and have their children serving as proxies online. And just as it should not be held against her, neither should it be an excuse...&nbsp; In any case, we see that this is how the community can help polish a question like that...remove the rough edges and simplify it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I refuse to let this die, so I&#039;ll just keep posting questions here. If there is no response, I&#039;ll relay these questions to the candidates myself and will post their responses here. If they&#039;d rather respond directly, they should probably send word- in person or by proxy.&nbsp; If I get no electronic response, I&#039;ll start making phone calls.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to help, please let me know.&nbsp; I have some ENG gear so we can do person-on-the-street interviews.&nbsp; If nothing else, I can do a great comedy skit, where we walk around and ask people if they know who their council member is and if they have any thoughts about the election.&nbsp; Lets not let it get to that... <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /><br />

					That&#039;s really funny about Stanley, and even funnier that he didn&#039;t see the issue... <br /><br />Shelby2, thanks for the link to Astorians site.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, no questions posed here yet.&nbsp; I had high hopes...<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested in discussing this possibility of an election forum to be developed and presented here, and more broadly I am working on a Drupal-based web-infrastructure for a community-based journalism initiative. Unlike the &quot;representative journalism&quot; model, or the vanguardist &quot;consultant&quot; model, I&#039;d like to merge the two together, and build a kind of grass-roots reporting project. It would be a web-to-print model, using a website to collect and organize/filter content for an occasional print newspaper/magazine/tabloid featuring &quot;news&quot; and &quot;issues&quot; as well as narratives of the human experience--with a Jackson Heights (and surrounding area/Queens) orientation. For example, I think it&#039;s important to &quot;feature&quot; the history of the neighborhood by interviewing senior members of our community and getting their life stories down on paper. Since everyone in the neighborhood either moved here from somewhere else, OR grew up here, they all have stories to tell that are likely worth reading. I have a whole road map for how this would work and will announce this here at some point. If anyone is interested, please send me a message, as this is still the formative stages. For example, I haven&#039;t named the project and I&#039;d like the first set of stakeholders to help with the naming/branding of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyhow, first things first. The election. Perhaps we should start with the &quot;opinions&quot; and then work back from there?&nbsp; &nbsp;Would it be easier to meet in person?&nbsp; It seems like it would be easier to do this HERE, but... <br /><br /><br />

					There has got to be a way to get information about stuff like this <span class="bbc_u">before</span> it happens. Does JHL have a news desk? Perhaps that&#039;s too old school. There has to be way to get information into the hands of someone who can get someone out there to &quot;cover&quot; the event.&nbsp; I feel like we&#039;re just shoveling back the ocean, or like Sisyphus, just rolling that big rock uphill. Little that happens in our neighborhood makes it into even the Queens papers, and while it may not be news for those outside JH, I&#039;m beginning to feel the vacuum-silence of our atomized public sphere. How many buildings have a newsletter? Does anyone know?

					But dssjh, I think it&#039;s okay that you&#039;re a partisan:&nbsp; can&#039;t we pose questions, have response, THEN offer our insights and points of view?&nbsp; I know there are many supporters of Danny Dromm on this website, but I think that Helen Sears has some backing here too. No? I&#039;m pretty sure that Stanley Kalathara himself actually posts here... Sears has taken a beating here, and while much if it may be deserved, that&#039;s a poor substitute for a debate and the endless complaining about Sears does nothing to ensure that the next city council member from the 25th has any more responsibility towards the residents of the district, nor does it ensure that we do anything but maintain an agitated silence about it... There is NOTHING keeping partisans of any camp from asking questions. Lets just use the consensus-building possibility of the forum to slice through the questions that seem one-sided or whatnot and then work out language that seems acceptable to all.<br /><br />Certainly, those who support a candidate should really feel like now is a chance to step up and offer support for their candidate. I think it would be a mistake not to at least try. But what I think we need is some kind of process--Aronan has offered some insight about how to do it. I&#039;ve been disappointed by the lack of real substantive dialogue in this race and since JHL offers a unique cross section of at least a certain demographic of &quot;online JH,&quot; I think that forums like this have unique potential to become places where constituents get together and organize...<br /><br />Or, perhaps we should walk around and ask people on the street.&nbsp; It would be interesting to hit topical hotspots and ask people about those issues as far as the city council race goes. It might be that a question for the candidates is part of a longer tack in communicating the concerns that we have about our community.&nbsp; Just an idea...

					Thanks for the response. I like your suggestions, but am not 100% how to manage the poll option... (I guess I&#039;m just not really clear on how that works, but the idea is appealing).&nbsp; And that JH is only part of the 25th is an issue... I guess we can be only representing the interests of the neighborhood, though participants in this forum may be more or less knowledgeable about issues outside of JH.&nbsp; So, I&#039;m not really sure how to handle that. <br /><br />Lets get some more feedback here and some comments, participation, and go from there. I think setting up a timeline as you&#039;ve suggested is a very good idea?<br /><br />Come on, folks!

					I&#039;ve been following the race for the City Council seat currently occupied by Helen Sears since late last year. <br /><br />Currently, the candidates in the Democratic Party Primary election are Danny Dromm, Stanley Kalathara, and Helen Sears, the incumbent. <br /><br />I hope we can get some conversation going about the merits of each candidate and who should represent Jackson Heights and the 25th Council District. Since the Primary is on September 15, it seems like the chances for meaningful dialogue are fast disappearing and Jackson Heights Life is the best place for a web-based forum. So, I&#039;d like to propose that we use the Jackson Heights Life forum, and this thread in particular, to work-out some community-based questions for the candidates. After generating a list of questions, we could pick the best and refine them for submission to each camp--who would be invited to respond directly here or through an intermediary of their choice. <br /><br />There is often ad hominem attack and &quot;red herrings&quot; where there might be basic information and reasoned debate. Before we can debate, however, I think we need some information from the candidates. <br /><br />There have been a lot of issues raised on Jackson Heights Life that are, in effect, campaign issues. These include but are not limited to: trash, the vendor question, parks/greenspace, safety/crime, transportation/traffic, schools, health care, and the development and sustainability of local business opportunities, among others. Sometimes these issues are raised here but the corresponding sense of it as an election-cycle issue is not well developed and the matter is dropped just when it might&nbsp; become productive to &quot;do something&quot; about it--Jeffsayyes&#039;s photography of the trash problem is a good example of what we might do as a start. It may be that that&#039;s the nature of the &quot;web forum&quot; as opposed to a more representative-journalistic function, in which members of the community do the developmental research and report back to the community in general (it&#039;s this model that I&#039;ll propose for JH at a later date). <br /><br />We might post a series of questions here, and then, either by consensus or committee, act to refine the questions and pose them in a neutral/non-partisan way to each candidate, whether in an &quot;interview&quot; format or in written form. These interviews could be typed verbatim or presented uncut in audio or video. It might be that each camp would rather respond to written prompts, and in many ways that&#039;s easiest and gives them control over the message. <br /><br />Please help by brainstorming some questions for the candidates.&nbsp; What questions do you have for them? If we have more than a few, we can refine/narrow them later, and I&#039;m happy to meet in person with other interested folks if there is interest.
