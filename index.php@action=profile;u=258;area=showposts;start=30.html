					Stopped by for the wine tasting at 4:30 this afternoon, and it was the highlight of an otherwise dreary day!&nbsp; What a fun thing to do on the way home from work.&nbsp; Wine was great.&nbsp; Bob Marley music was a festive contrast to the snow and slush outside.&nbsp; Really welcoming environment.&nbsp; I am delighted to welcome these guys to the neighborhood.&nbsp;

At the time, there was a fair amount of speculation/disbelief among parents as to how this small area--which is not an especially functional space, and not what I think most parents would have asked for had they been consulted--could have cost so much. The puppet area replaced what was formerly an exercise space used for weight training, etc. by teens and adults. This is one of the reasons the big-kid area has become so overcrowded--since the adults/teens no longer have a separate space, they work out on the monkey bars instead... <br /><br />I believe that the climbing structures, swings, etc. are more like 15 years old, dating from the last major renovation in the &#039;90s--although I agree that they didn&#039;t appear to me to be crying out for replacement, apart from the dilapidated sprinkler area, where I see kids constantly getting scraped up from the concrete surface.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They spent a half a million dollars building the ramp and the puppet theater?<br /><br />You&#039;re kidding. &nbsp;<br /><br />Then I have really low expectations for the $1.7 million. &nbsp;<br /><br />The climbing structures and swings are fine.&nbsp; Well, were fine.&nbsp; Everything in the &quot;big kid&quot; area is gone. &nbsp;Even if you are right and they are 15 years old, rather than 5, they were made of metal and wood! &nbsp;Metal and wood don&#039;t need frequent replacement. &nbsp;They could use paint. &nbsp;Or not. &nbsp;Paint isn&#039;t urgent. &nbsp;And yeah. &nbsp;They should have put down some squishy stuff by the sprinklers. &nbsp;But they tore up EVERYTHING. &nbsp;

					I don&#039;t think I even set foot in Travers Park before becoming a mom.&nbsp; It is now a focal point in the community for me.&nbsp; Normally I would be delighted to see resources being allocated to a place that is so important to my family.&nbsp; <br /><br />But this is absurd!!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />The swings and slides and places to climb and crawl are made out of wood and metal, and were installed in 2004.&nbsp; Apparently, after spending $500,000 in 2004, they had a great ribbon cutting in 2005.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_newsroom/media_advisories/media_advisories.php?id=19618" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_newsroom/media_advisories/media_advisories.php?id=19618</a>&nbsp; I do not understand why, after a few short summers, everything is being bulldozed.&nbsp; The &quot;big kid&quot; play area looks like a war zone.&nbsp; Today, even though it was play street day, the toddler area was mobbed, with lots of big kids trying to get on the toddler slides and taking up space that toddlers should have been enjoying.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d been looking at the big kid area with anticipation for quite a while,&nbsp; I figured this was our last season in the toddler area.&nbsp; My daughter was almost ready for the big kid slides and swings.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; I have no idea when anything will be available to her.&nbsp; <br /><br />$1.7 million dollars?<br /><br />$1.7 million dollars, to undo everything they did with the $500,000 sthey spent on the park 5 years ago?&nbsp; Not to build on the original work, but to bulldoze the original work?&nbsp; I&#039;m outraged.<br /><br />Is there any way to get an injunction against the demoliton of the toddler area?&nbsp; Does anyone know?<br /><br />

					About 4 years ago today I woke up and went to check the paper on the way to work, fully expecting to see that Bryan Pu Folkes had defeated Helen Sears.&nbsp; Everyone I knew supported Bryan.&nbsp; I was baffled when I saw the results.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone I know supported Danny.&nbsp; But I was still nervous.&nbsp; Rather than wait for the morning paper, when I woke up and saw it was midnight, I went to the computer, and NY1 online had the results posted.&nbsp; I felt as if an enormous weight had been lifted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Congratuations Danny.&nbsp;

					I don&#039;t think any of us can tell you if you will be happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/tongue.gif" alt="&#58;P" title="Tongue" class="smiley" /><br /><br />But I will tell you why I am happy.<br /><br />I love the mature trees in JH.&nbsp; I love the little narrow gardens that are in front of os many of the buildings in the historic district, and the fact that 3/4&#039;s of the year I walk past a ever-changing display of flowers and flowering bushes.&nbsp; I love the six story tree right outside my 6th floor window. I feel like I live in a tree house, with squirrels and pigeons living their lives oblivious to me.&nbsp; I love the fact that when the leaves drop, and the tree is bare, I can peek past the bare branches and see the Empire State Building.&nbsp; I love sitting in my building&#039;s lush garden.&nbsp; I also love visiting some of the lovely gardens in the community&#039;s churches, and I do so rather frequently because my toddler/preschooler often asks if we can stop and visit a garden.<br /><br />I love the fact that Central Park is 3 express stops away on the F train, with elevators in both directions, so I don&#039;t have to drag my daughter&#039;s stroller up and down steps.&nbsp; I love afternoons at the Queens Zoo, in Flushing Meadow Park.&nbsp; I love the playground at Travers Park, and I love the cultural events that take place there.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the fact that there is a clear divide in our community.&nbsp; Some of us have access to beautiful private gardens.&nbsp; Many of us don&#039;t.&nbsp; And the fact that the most powerful/influential residents mostly live in buildings with private gardents, means that there has never been a successful push to create a public green space (outside of Travers Park and the churches) that the rest of the community can enjoy.&nbsp; Oddly, I find that when I stop in the beautiful church gardens, most of the people enjoying the gardens are residents who live in garden buildings, and are just enjoying a different garden.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

					I attended a wonderful party this weekend to celebrate a 3 year old&#039;s birthday, and i was actually suprised that it was in a coop garden.&nbsp; They served food, but did not cook.&nbsp; They set up an inflatable kids&#039;s swimming pool and sprinklers.&nbsp; I was very impressed.&nbsp; But I think it is very unusual for coops to allow that kind of activity in their gardens.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was actually shocked when I moved into my current apartment, (after having lived in JH for many years), that my new apartment allowed alcohol consumption in the garden.&nbsp; I know that is a big no no in most buildings.&nbsp; But as it turns out, the people who have historically done the most work in the garden, the folks who have made it beautiful and kept it beautiful, like to sit outside in their beautiful garden and drink a bottle of nice wine together.&nbsp; And no one would have the nerve to tell them not to.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />I really like the idea of the wine and cheese get togethers.&nbsp; I know that the Chateau has done that for quite a while, but I really thought that alcohol was a big taboo in most gardens.&nbsp;

					I&#039;m joining this discussion late, but I have a couple of comments.<br /><br />First of all, thank you Jeff for your photo study.&nbsp; What stood out to me was the images of overflowing trash cans over and over again.&nbsp; It seems like residents and visitors are often faced with two options.&nbsp; They can walk over to an overflowing trashcan and try to balancing their&nbsp; litter on top of the huge pile, before a wind picks it up and carries it away.&nbsp; Or they can just drop their litter on the street.&nbsp; Neither option is acceptable.&nbsp; Clearly, we need more trash cans, and more trash pick ups.<br /><br />My understanding is that a lot of city services (including garbage pick ups) are allocated based on census data.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet another good reason to promote having everyone counted in the upcoming census.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not going to result in cleaner streets right now.<br /><br />Can anyone explain the role of the Doe Foundation in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; I am always delighted to see these guys out working in the community.&nbsp; I attended an event recently that was catered by Doe participants, and I was exceptionally impressed with them.&nbsp; I know that they provide temporary housing, job training and a variety of support services for formerly incarcerated individuals.&nbsp; I think it is a great project.&nbsp; But what are the implications of having them work in specific communities?&nbsp; <br /><br />Does the City say &quot;well, Doe is in JH, so we can cut services there?&quot;&nbsp; I know that happened years ago with welfare reform, when public assistance recipients were forced to participate in cleaning up the subways and the parks and a variety of menial tasks in exchange for their welfare checks.&nbsp; And if you did the math, their labor turned out to be significantly less than minimum wage.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lots of good City jobs with benefits and unions disappeared because the City decided that it was in their best interest to have welfare moms do the work for less than minimum wage, rather than maintaining employees with benefits and pensions.&nbsp; Is that happening with Doe?&nbsp; Or is it clear that Doe is supposed to be a supplement to City services, not a replacement for City services?&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone know?

					Thanks for your post.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve worked in JH for 20 years and lived here about 16.&nbsp; You are new to the neighborhood, but you keep running into Danny Dromm at events and meetings that are important to you.&nbsp; For a lot of years, I&#039;ve had the same experience that you&#039;ve had in your short time here.&nbsp; Long before Danny was a candidate, he was just around.&nbsp; He is interested in issues of importance to the community, and I run into him all the time advocating for issues of importance to the community.&nbsp; I have for years.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not surprised that you don&#039;t know Helen Sears.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been stood up by her at her local office at least a half a dozen times, and maybe 3 or 4 times in her Manhattan office. Stood up by her in my office 2 or 3 times.&nbsp; Stopped inviting her actually.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been to meetings of Queens City Council members and seen her empty chair and nametag and water glass.&nbsp; Same thing at the annual hearings at the Borough President&#039;s office.&nbsp; Even meetings of the finance committee, on which she supposedly serves.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen Helen Sears more in the past week than in the past 8 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t work for Danny Dromm either.&nbsp; I probably would have volunteered for him if I didn&#039;t have a very busy preschooler at home, and very little free time these days.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But as a community resident, I feel very strongly about this election. <br /><br />

					You know, I congratulate all of you who knew in advance that Monserrate was going to set up a non-existent not for profit with City money, beat his wife, and ultimately stage some bizarre coup in Albany.&nbsp; You are clearly more politically savvy than I am.&nbsp; And clearly more politically savvy than the rest of the population.&nbsp; <br /><br />I admit my mistakes.&nbsp; There was a time that I supported Monserrate, and felt that he supported the community.&nbsp; He supported causes that I supported.&nbsp; He funneled public money into real not for profits, who did good work with that money.&nbsp; He stopped and listened to his constituents, and advocated for issues of importance to the community.&nbsp; And he was visible.&nbsp; He lived here.&nbsp; He worked here.&nbsp; I saw him on the streets.&nbsp; At meetings.&nbsp; At parades.&nbsp; At public events.&nbsp; I supported him.&nbsp; I&#039;m ashamed now.&nbsp; But I did.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m really baffled.&nbsp; Some days I&#039;m convinced that we are going to find out he has a brain tumor or something.&nbsp; His recent behavior really is not consistent with his previous behavior.&nbsp; Or maybe it is easier for me to believe that, than to believe that I was duped. <br /><br />But a lot of us were duped.&nbsp; He was a very popular politician, with a respectable record.&nbsp; Now, bashing him and anyone close to him is a neighborhood sport.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Danny Dromm made the same mistake I did.&nbsp; And Helen Sears did.&nbsp; And the majority of neighborhood residents did.&nbsp; <br /><br />Should Danny Dromm have seen it coming?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But I challenge anyone here to point to any signs of Monserrat&#039;s madness two years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />
