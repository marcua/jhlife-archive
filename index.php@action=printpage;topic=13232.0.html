				This is Grace, the last of the 2 dozen or so cats that lived in our co-op&#039;s backyard.&nbsp; We have been able to place virtually all of them, but Grace, who has been well fed by the residents of the block, has remained on the street until a few days ago.&nbsp; A good Samaritan and lover of cats took her in and has been caring for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;She cannot keep her because she is returning to her home in Arizona, but describes her as &quot;sweet&quot;, lets herself be petted and uses the litter box. She is well fed and quite beautiful--looks rather like a Russian Gray.&nbsp; She has abandonment issues, is shy, but not afraid of either people (who have been feeding her for the past year and a half) or dogs.&nbsp; She has been spayed, is healthy, but if we can&#039;t find a home for her in the next week or two, we will have to return her to the street, where, it must be said, she has fared quite well thus far.&nbsp; All in all, we&#039;d rather not.&nbsp; Takers anyone?
