				With regard to the sign -- the new owner informed me that the sign was rotting off.&nbsp; The wrong bolts were used and the previous owner never applied for a permit.&nbsp; Very nice of him to take the time to respond.&nbsp; <br /><br />But still, I miss the sign.&nbsp; A good sign adds so much character.

				agreed. i really dislike the trend of forcing businesses to accept uniformity of signage across a block of storefronts (like the block containing Dunkin&#039;, Ricky&#039;s, Tibetan-Japanese. reminds me of a sad suburban strip mall.

				It’s hardly a trend. They are simply putting back the type of signage that was original to the buildings. What I do find is a trend, are people opening up a business and putting up illegal awnings that are dangerous, without applying for permits, and putting their financial goals ahead of safety. So, if you hate the signs so much, why dont you just move?

				Yes...safety.&nbsp; Following the trend of signs falling and injuring people on the streets of JH, the obvious solution is a crackdown on small businesses.

				It’s hardly a crack down on small businesses. When you own a business big or small there are rules to follow. One of them, as basic as it seems, is to apply for permits for any work that you are doing that might involve safety.&nbsp; You cannot just put signage that you like outside of your business as you see fit. That is ridiculous.&nbsp; Take 5th Avenue for example. Do you see ugly signs and awnings hanging outside over the sidewalk advertising their business. No you don’t, because they apply for permits, and put up what is allowed and usually appropriate So why is Jackson Heights any different? Why do you see a crack down on small businesses in Jackson Heights when the laws are being enforced? Because you don’t like them?

				I think that there is some confusion&nbsp; regarding signage/awnings and landmarks.&nbsp; Prior to JH becoming an historic district, signage and awnings, especially in the 1980&#039;s, were both,&nbsp; IMHO,&nbsp; both garish AND unsafe. The one I remember the most was the huge airplane awning jutting out of the building on 37th avenue between 86 and 87 streets. It was some sort of money transfer/ travel agency.&nbsp; &nbsp;In a snowstorm, the whole thing came crashing down onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; &nbsp;While the signage/ awnings depicted in the prior links appear colorful and diverse, they&nbsp; were uniform in such a way as to&nbsp; highlight&nbsp; the architecture of each of the buildings. You can see this on 82 street where the black glass signs have been put up. Each store does something different to the surface of it, but you can appreciate the building design. I do agree, however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the cost of doing business necessitates permits for safety and for complying with Landmarks. I got so hungry typing that I think I&#039;ll go and get a slice or 2!!…..and keep my fingers cross that an airplane doesn&#039;t come crashing down on my head!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Those black glass signs are so boring and blah. I was really disappointed when they put them up. But yes, I am happy that the death rate has gone down considerably in the city since they stopped the sign-caused decapitation epidemic.

				Are you aware that the city requires buildings to be inspected every three years to be sure that no part of the façade, bricks or mortar or signage can become loose and fall and kill or injure&nbsp; a pedestrian? A few people were killed five years ago, so they’ve updated the laws to be sure it doesn’t happen again, and to be sure, permits are in place.&nbsp; As Du Fratelli stated, the bolts were loose, an accident waiting to happen, Since they put up their own signage as they see fit without a permit.<br />

				And permits are not for the city to make money as some would believe. Permits are cheap. But, they are meant to ensure safety, among many other reasons.
