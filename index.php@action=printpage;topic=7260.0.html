				On the in the previous post, Jeff quotes the developer as saying they&#039;ll serve &quot;American&quot; food. &nbsp;I see no need for &quot;American&quot; food here, but if that&#039;s what they have in mind, here&#039;s my wish list of quintessentially American fast food joints that would be fun to have there:<br /><br />1. First East Coast outpost of Tandoori Chicken USA (http://www.tcusamobile.com/main.php)... a longstanding cult favorite in the SF Bay Area. &nbsp;Their Tandoori Chicken Sandwich is killer, and unlike anything currently available here.<br />2. First Queens outpost of The Kati Roll Company (http://www.thekatirollcompany.com)<br />3. Street food-style dosas (http://dosatruck.com/)<br />4. Korean (http://kimchitacotruck.com/press.html) or Indian (http://www.tacolassi.com/tacos_be_with_you/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=466) style tacos<br />5. The reincarnation of Timmy O&#039;s Frozen Custard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/timmy-os-frozen-custard-corona)<br /><br />Of course, less uniquely &quot;American&quot; concepts could also do well here:<br />6. A larger space for the existing 37th Road chaat house<br />7. A bubble tea vendor (http://www.facebook.com/quicklynyc)<br />8. Vietnamese sandwiches (http://www.vietnamese-sandwich.com/)<br /><br /><br /><br />In this narrow window of time we have to fantasize about what a &quot;Jackson Heights Food Court&quot; <em>might</em> be like (before we&#039;re confronted with the disappointing reality), what would you like to see there?

				I think we have a dearth of American food in the hood, so I welcome this (well, depending on what really ends up there).&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see a 5 Guys or a really good brick-oven pizza place (I know about Rosa&#039;s, but that&#039;s way too far for me).&nbsp; Yes, I&#039;m aware this is a pipe dream.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				OMG, make it like the New World Mall Food Court in Flushing, but add more ethnic options. Imagine a food court where you can get Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, Middle Eastern, Mexican, Spanish, a burger place, a pizza place, a smoothie place, an ice cream place, anything you can think of...<br /><br />Honestly, it makes no sense to have it be &quot;American food.&quot; You can get that anywhere. The Queens Center mall isn&#039;t that far away, lol. They should be taking advantage of the fact that we have such a insanely diverse community, give it a local feel, and keep the prices low.

				so there&#039;s a sign outside listing what&#039;s on tap, and it&#039;s mostly south asian ... haleem, biriyanis, bartaas (that one, i&#039;m excited about, since they&#039;ve been hard to come by lately).<br /><br />one of the more intriguing items is &quot;halal tacos&quot;<br /><br />looking forward to the opening.

				that place never looked particularly appealing -- especially compared to similar, similarly priced places in the surrounding blocks. but it&#039;s true about most restaurants. if you look at the DOH site, even a lot of &quot;A&quot; grade places have roach/insect violations noticed (roaches don&#039;t count as many points to the health dep&#039;t).

				A food court in Jackson Heights could have so much potential. The execution here was just horrible.<br />Imagine a food court with nice seating a stalls setup for the tamale lady, the best taco guys, the arepa lady, the no name chicken and ride guy by the bank on 74th and 37th, etc.

				<br />I started using this place after Kabab King had health violations. I always wondered why there was no letter grade showing for their health status but I perhaps naively hoped for the best. I dread to think what those violations might be even more so since I ate there a few weeks ago. <br /><br />Maybe the meeting on Diversity Plaza tomorrow can address the larger issues of making sure our restaurant food is clean. The environment of 74th Street also needs to be attended to as it is more often than not just a dirty garbage strewn mess.

It seems more likely that so-called &quot;ethnic&quot; businesses wind up renting space here because they&#039;re attracted to the neighborhood by the large potential customer base.

My explanation -- that ethnic enclaves draw businesses that cater to those enclaves could also be the cause. It&#039;s not clear that property owners are discriminating against (or offering preferential treatment) to people of the same ethnicity. If there&#039;s evidence of that happening, I&#039;d like to see it. Right now it seems like mostly conjecture to me.

It&#039;s brought up constantly on these boards and it always seems specious to me. For one thing owners can&#039;t simultaneously prefer businesses owned by people of the same ethnicity AND national retailers; those are opposing priorities. It seems more likely that so-called &quot;ethnic&quot; businesses wind up renting space here because they&#039;re attracted to the neighborhood by the large potential customer base.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry, different owners. The JHBA/JBBA properties along 73rd and 74th tend to rent &quot;within the family.&quot; The landlords on 37th east of 75th, and along 82nd, go with the highest bidders. <br /><br />It&#039;s not even necessarily about preferential rent; when there&#039;s a vacancy, the JHBA/JBBA folks just ask among the people who belong to the organization, and ask people they know, rather than advertising it publicly.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That doesn&#039;t imply causation though. My explanation -- that ethnic enclaves draw businesses that cater to those enclaves could also be the cause. It&#039;s not clear that property owners are discriminating against (or offering preferential treatment) to people of the same ethnicity. If there&#039;s evidence of that happening, I&#039;d like to see it. Right now it seems like mostly conjecture to me.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is definitely a &quot;thing&quot; in NYC and is very prevalent in JH.&nbsp; It is not conjecture. I really don&#039;t want to say where I work but it is something we have studied and JH was specifically mentioned as a hotbed of preferential treatment.&nbsp; If you are skeptical, go try to rent a storefront and see how it goes.<br /><br />edited to add: thanks for the link, Dodger.&nbsp; Sounds like it will be yet another grocery with steam tables.&nbsp; Not terrible but not very exciting either.
