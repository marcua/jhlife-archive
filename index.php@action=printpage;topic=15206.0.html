				Five house cats were dumped and are now living in back of a co-op.&nbsp; They are being fed but are going to be trapped, vetted and assessed for adoptability.&nbsp; If you think you might like to foster or adopt one, please call Julia at 917,887,0847&nbsp; Two are Siamese mix and the others are tiger, gender TBD but they are all young cats, probably no more than 2 years old.<br />There is a flyer posted in JuJu&#039;s and Expresso 77

				Five abandoned cats! That&#039;s awful. <br /><br />I&#039;m willing to foster and possibly adopt one if my Momo does well with another cat. I have been thinking about getting her a friend to keep her company, but I remember you told me that she might be an &quot;only cat.&quot; Do you have more information about these cats? Is there anything we could post on Facebook to spread the word?

				A six month old female was just rescued. She is one of the 77th street five. She has an infection but has been treated and is resting. She is a grey tiger with a white bib.&nbsp; Very sweet.<br />We have a possible home for her, but just in case I&#039;m posting her. If you are interested in either fostering or adopting you can email me.<br />She cannot be spayed for another three weeks.&nbsp; But has tested negative for FIV/FeLV<br />Thanks everyone!<br />
