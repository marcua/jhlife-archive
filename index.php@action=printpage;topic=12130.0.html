				&nbsp;Straight from the horse&#039;s mouth - he was skyped from Paris on Sunday where he is working on his <br />Jackson Heights film. It&#039;s close to finished and will likely be around 3hrs and 10minutes. Look for a <br />Fall 2015 showing most likely at a NYC Film Festival according to others at the screening of his film<br />&quot;Hospital&quot; at MOMI in Astoria.<br />&nbsp; C&#039;est magnifique Frederick Wiseman!

				This is beyond exciting! I googled and found this link from his distributor: http://www.zipporah.com/films/44<br /><br />So the title will probably be &quot;In Jackson Heights.&quot; Do you know the focus or the theme of the documentary?

				The master of this kind of filmmaking is Frederick Wiseman, now 85, whose sustained acts of attention to various places, institutions and social phenomena constitute one of the great monuments of modern filmmaking. His new film, “In Jackson Heights,” will have its premiere at the Venice Film Festival next month: More than three hours long, it visits a Queens neighborhood that is one of North America’s most diverse places.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/movies/frederick-wisemans-documentaries-defy-straightforward-plot.html?mwrsm=Email&amp;_r=0

				I&#039;m really excited to see this.&nbsp; It&#039;s fantastic that Wiseman made a documentary about our neighborhood. I&#039;m curious: Did anyone reading this get filmed by him or see him filming? I&#039;m guessing, given what I know of his style, that he would be very unobtrusive. <br /><br />The film will be at Film Forum November 4 - November 17.<br /><br />http://filmforum.org/film/in-jackson-heights-film<br />

				http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/toronto-international-film-festival-2015-in-jackson-heights-and-born-to-dance<br /><br />Excerpt:<br /><br />&quot;Not two days into my Toronto Film Festival experience, I found myself back in New York courtesy Frederick Wiseman&#039;s superb documentary In Jackson Heights, a 190-minute portrait of the titular Queens neighborhood that teems with a vitality appropriate to its subject. A number of Wiseman&#039;s recent films, such as Boxing Gym and National Gallery, feel like profiles of closed systems with their own moral guidelines and rules of conduct—distinct microcosms lying just beyond the larger sphere of humanity. By contrast, In Jackson Heights can&#039;t help but burst at the seams since the neighborhood it depicts is one of the world&#039;s most diverse. Name a religion, a race, a sexual identity, etc. and it&#039;s likely to be found somewhere in the community&#039;s bustling 300 acres. Jackson Heights isn&#039;t of the world so much as it is the world.<br /><br />Wiseman and his frequent cinematographer, John Davey, still take the same approach they normally do, with no identifying titles, talking heads, or voiceover commentary, focusing more on the gently coursing rhythm of the captured images and sounds. Even when lingering at length in a specific location, it always feels like we&#039;re moving forward (the film is edited so that it seems to take place over three days and nights) and that each moment is fleeting.<br /><br />This is fitting for a film in which one of the primary tensions is keeping the gentrifying wolves at bay. If there&#039;s a standout character it would be openly gay district councilman Daniel Dromm, who starts off the film with a joyous recitation of all (or as many as he can off-the-cuff remember) of Jackson Heights&#039;s numerous ethnicities. He pops up several times thereafter, negotiating a deal with other politicians, celebrating a local Catholic business owner (a truly touching scene that hilariously climaxes with a brash, leather-clad woman delivering a singing telegram), or officiating at Jackson Heights&#039;s annual LGBT pride parade, an extravagantly celebratory event forever tinged by the 1990 gay bashing and murder of one of the neighborhood&#039;s own, Julio Rivera.<br /><br />Light in darkness and darkness in light; for every affirmative moment, Wiseman finds a complementary negative. At a senior citizen&#039;s gathering, a 98-year-old woman bemoans her lonely existence, only to be told by one of the attendees that she should use her ample wealth to buy herself some friends. Hispanic laborers, many of them living in the United States illegally, gather to try and secure overtime pay from exploitative bosses. Several business owners in a small mall attempt to counteract the eviction notices that will drive them out and bring a Home Depot in.&quot;

				I only lasted for two hours. It is very long. It is lovely visually but in so many places, he could have cut, cut, cut. And much as I love Danny Dromm, he is in there a LOT. Do we also need to watch his staff field annoying phone calls? <br /><br />In a way I think it will be of greater interest to people who don&#039;t see many of these sights every day when they walk down the street. <br /><br />Still it is great to have the neighborhood celebrated this way. And the reviews have been stellar. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I agree it is long, however there is not very much I would cut out. I think the film is like a time capsule of what our neighborhood is like today.<br /><br />In my case, although I live here, the film gave insight into many aspects of the neighborhood that are not part of my everyday life. As an example, the scene of the meeting of immigrants to the US where the woman shared the story of her daughter crossing the border from Mexico is not a meeting that I would have likely found myself in. There are so many events happening in our neighborhood everyday and we naturally gravitate to those that relate directly to our lives.<br /><br />I thought the film was great and I&#039;d highly recommend it. I think it is a must-see for anyone living in JH.<br /><br />Wiseman will be on Leonard Lopate today to talk about the film:<br />http://www.wnyc.org/story/frederick-wiseman/

				The film is great.<br /><br />And mostly delves into the side of Jackson Heights about which we on this forum are pretty much oblivious...even though, ironically we are slap bang in the midst of it...and it surrounds us.<br /><br />Thanks Mr Wiseman.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;I think Fred Wiseman is great as a documentary filmmaker and can attest to his films holding up over time<br />having recently seen Hospital from 1970. In Jackson Heights seems to be heavily concentrated on the one<br />street I frequent the least of our four main thoroughfares in the neighborhood, Roosevelt Ave, and he seems<br />to have chosen it for the reasons that I avoid it. As a resident, you would probably not visit this street unless<br />you had business there. The film uses Jackson Hts as a location but it doesn&#039;t sound like JH as the 24/7<br />experience of longtime residents who probably live off Roosevelt Ave towards Northern, 34th and 35th Aves <br />where most of the community lives.<br />&nbsp;Will definitely see the film and am enthusiastic but have heard lukewarm reviews from locals who probably<br />expected to see more of their residential life portrayed. Realistically, this may have been too quiet visually<br />and it&#039;s hard to compete with the cacophany of Roosevelt Ave on any given day. Reviews from outside have<br />been stellar though, as was previously noted. But go Fred! for choosing us over what had to have been many<br />other options.

				I saw the movie over the weekend.&nbsp; Yes it’s long and maybe could have been shorter –but the time did not drag.&nbsp; It’s really fun to see such familiar places on a big screen.&nbsp; <br />Highlights for me were the female mariachi band + the instructor for the Taxi Test preparation class.&nbsp; Overall it’s a good representation but I wish there was more on our Indian neighbors.&nbsp; <br />

				I saw the film and liked it quite a lot.&nbsp; It&#039;s really great to see Jackson Heights on the big screen and so beautifully filmed.&nbsp; My favorite scenes were some of the short-to-medium length ones, such as the taxi-driver class, a lovely funny scene in a laundromat, a performance at Terraza 7, a short scene in a pet store and the various religious services.<br /><br />But the film is way too long, and part of the problem, I think, is that Wiseman really loves meetings.&nbsp; There are some really powerful accounts of migration and discrimination told at the meetings of Make the Road NY, and some interesting discussions of retail gentrification, but in my view some of these scenes go on for way too long.&nbsp; This was the same problem I had with Wiseman&#039;s film of UC Berkeley that played at the film festival at Lincoln Center last year.&nbsp; In that one there were these endless meetings of university administrators.&nbsp; The problem was, these didn&#039;t seem like real meetings--Rather, they were opportunities for administrators to speak to Wiseman&#039;s camera about the problem of underfunding of higher education. I think there was a little of that problem here too--some of the meetings didn&#039;t feel like real meetings but rather the use of a meeting form as an opportunity for people to speak to the camera. I guess even though Wiseman&#039;s documentaries are celebrated for doing away with talking-heads, it seems to me that he smuggles his talking-heads in via these scenes.<br /><br />Lastly, I agree with the previous commentator who mentioned the film&#039;s focus on Roosevelt Ave. I&#039;m surprised he didn&#039;t pay more attention to 74th Street as well, as it seems like it would have fit his vision well. I also think there was a missed opportunity to show more places in the neighborhood where different communities come together. The scene at the farmers&#039; market was very brief, and there were no scenes that I can recall in the public schools. If you&#039;re going to show meetings, a PTA meeting might have been a good one.

				At a Q &amp; A with Mr Wiseman, things he missed out here in Jackson Heights were mentioned and he replied that, yes it was a shame he only had 3 hours and ten minutes to squeeze everything into...<br /><br />That&#039;s the beauty of being the filmmaker...you get to decide what&#039;s in and what&#039;s out.<br /><br />Others are free to make their own Jackson Heights documentaries... and then they can decide what to include and not ...

				Saw it today, would have definitely liked to have seen more areas shown... too heavily focused on Roosevelt Ave. but as others have said, showing residential day to day life probably wouldn&#039;t have made the most interesting documentary.The chicken scene was hard to watch also.<br /><br />Watching the muslim scenes after the latest attacks on paris was also rather cringeworthy.

				I saw the film last evening.&nbsp; I thought parts of it were informative especially about the BID.<br />That explains a lot. The Asian population and contribution to this neighborhood was not shown and Little Indian East was skimmed over in my opinion. I don&#039;t think it portrayed the true diversity of our neighborhood.&nbsp; That said it was entertaining, especially the scene in the taxi driver education class. I don&#039;t think I will ever forget my directions again.

				Filmmaking by definition must be dramatic.<br /><br />There is nothing inherently dramatic about middle class people living safe and pretty lives.<br /><br />And so the filmmaker has focused on situations with higher stakes.<br /><br />Otherwise, the 3 hour film would have been exactly like someone&#039;s home movie.<br /><br />Deathly dull for everyone... apart from those in the movie.<br />&nbsp;

				&nbsp;I agree that the movie was overly dramatized for those moments where something he considered exciting is happening- <br />even though his style of filmmaking is supposedly not that. Knowing some of the people personally, the edit was not an accurate <br />portrayal of their true selves in the worst tabloid way of crap journalism. And so long! The film selected many parts of <br />Roosevelt Avenue, so little of Northern Blvd. and not much in between. Used to hold his work in high esteem but have <br />since reevaluated that position based on the slant of this movie which looks like it was done by one of those one day in <br />the life crews of the 80&#039;s.<br />&nbsp; IMHO don&#039;t call it &quot;In Jackson Heights&quot; if you aren&#039;t looking at the whole of the community, bland and colorful, as we have <br />alot of both.
