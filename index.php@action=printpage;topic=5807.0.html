				Hi all,<br /><br />Just something I was thinking about recently: <br /><br />I lived in Greenpoint and Williamsburg before and noticed that, over the years, changes happened (I think most of you have heard).&nbsp; Organic food stores started popping up, innovative restaurants opened their doors and art galleries sprung up.&nbsp; I am hesitant to call it true gentrification (although Williamsburg now may be undergoing that) because, at least in Greenpoint, the old character of the neighborhood was somewhat preserved.<br /><br />The changes were a function of hip people looking for better rents and more space moving out of Manhattan and setting up in these areas.<br /><br />I wonder if Jackson Heights would undergo the same sort of transformation?&nbsp; For those of you who have lived here for a while, have you noticed any changes?&nbsp; Do you think what happened in Greenpoint might happen in Jackson Heights one day?<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a good or bad thing (although I would welcome an Organic Food restaurant and more restaurant varieties)--I&#039;m just curious...<br /><br />

				Better watch out, you&#039;ll get a reputation as a trust fund hipstertarian!&nbsp; :D<br /><br />We moved here in 2002, since then ESPRESSO 77 and TABLE WINE opened, the FARMER&#039;S MARKET went all year, FARM SPOT CSA began. STARBUCKS moved in.<br /><br />There are some real concerns as regards commercial real estate rates in the area that may restrict small, locally-and-independently owned/run&nbsp; businesses, so who knows?

				I agree with Ed, until it is easier for locals to open their own businesses in the neighborhood, it will never happen. <br /><br />Which is a shame, because these locally owned businesses understand the true needs of a neighborhood and provide services to meet those needs.&nbsp; What commercial landlords may not understand is that it is these types of business that attract more people to the neighborhood which in turn creates more demand for more larger, commercial lessees such as banks, supermarkets, etc.<br /><br />I also tend to think of Jackson Heights as a co-op neighborhood more than a rental.&nbsp; The young creative class usually jumps on a neighborhood where the rents are cheap; in other words, they&#039;re not looking to buy 2-bedroom co-ops.&nbsp; From what I&#039;ve seen, the transplants arrive here looking to start families not open record shops.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am very pleased with the openings of Table Wine and E77, as well as the greenmarket and farmshare.&nbsp; I think it does signify a trend, but not of the magnitude of anything seen in Greenpoint.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				i tend to agree with rumble imp. i lived in greenpoint -- the far northern end of franklin, to be precise -- in the mid 1980s. it was a great place to live, in that we had a two bedroom apartment for under 300 bucks, with a manhattan view and a great bodega that doubled as an illegal liquor store across the street. but it was also largely desolate. our street had a total of four businesses in a ten-block stretch -- three bodegas and a great old man bar. manhattan ave was more bustling -- and i loved the fact that most of the businesses had been there for 30-plus years.<br /><br />i&#039;d venture that the young creative class was able to move in 10-15 years later because the rents were still really cheap, and landlords then became more capable of raising them (small houses have no rent control/stabilization, so the sky is the limit). back when new york still had cheap neighborhoods, we called it gentrification -- a moot point these days, given the virtually complete gentrification of the whole city. it&#039;s harder to transform a middle-class area -- in that it&#039;s simpler to evict an elderly person from a rental in a house -- or gouge a barely-survivng hardware store owner -- than it is to displace, say, a thriving gold jewelry shop.<br /><br />and for the record, i&#039;d like to see more locally-owned businesses of all sorts -- even if they are shops (like the aforementioned gold jewelry places) that i wouldn&#039;t patronize all that often myself.

				I think Jackson Heights has a better chance of becoming more like Park Slope, albeit to a lesser degree. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods are starting to price out the middle class. So those people move here to have kids and start families. I&#039;ve been here 7 years, and the difference is noticeable in my building and on the streets. The change won&#039;t be as quick or as drastic. Park Slope grew up during a real estate bubble; Jackson Heights is changing during a depressed market. Besides Queens and Jackson Heights don&#039;t have the &quot;cool&quot; factor that Brooklyn and Park Slope do.

				This is worrisome to me as I feel there is a strong divide between classes and cultures here. Astorians complain, too, about the local shops <br />being far from what they want. Slowly Steinway street is changing but the residential profile has had a younger contingent for years that <br />is not reflected in the type of stores/restaurants in the main shopping concentrations. But it seems to be not a problem in Forest Hills which<br />has a neighborly feel and a mix of chains and independents that all appear to coexist nicely.

				I think the stores in JH will change as the population does. Right now it seems like every 3rd store is a 99 cent store. These stores are clearly making money, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t exist. Once they&#039;re not profitable, they will give way to something else. <br /><br />I think people sometimes expect too much too quickly from JH. According to the latest census figures, I am a still very much in the minority. And those numbers probably don&#039;t accurately reflect the undocumented population either. While I&#039;d like more stores that cater to my tastes, there aren&#039;t enough people to support them.

				I&#039;m not totally supportive of a rash of hipster bars showing up but I do wish that there were a few more stores and establishments that catered to me.&nbsp; A small organic food store!&nbsp; More cafes, more creative ventures than another 99 cent store or bank...<br /><br />Is there anything that can be done to encourage this?&nbsp; I think there are enough people around who would utilize the services of an organic food store, etc.<br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;m not totally sure.&nbsp; For example, Expresso 77 is more along the lines of a place I&#039;d hang out in but how is it doing?&nbsp;

				It will not. <br /><br />Greenpoint/Williamsburg is completely different from JH. Homes in Greenpoint/Williamsburg were/are rental â€˜subwaysâ€™ not coops with idiotic boards and rules and regulations. Artists and wannabe artists hate this shâ€¦ Additionally Greenpoint/Williamsburg is just an extension of LES. LES was an extension of SOHO etc. So next natural extension would be Ridgewood/Bushwick. <br /><br />JH might become cheaper version of Park Slope but it will take 10-20 years.<br /><br />Btw, Expresso 77 reassembles everything I donâ€™t like. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;:laugh:

				Espresso 77 is a small business owned by a neighborhood couple who love and are committed to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; They showcase local artists in the cafe and publicize community events.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a &quot;wannabe&quot; community cafe; it&#039;s very much of this community.<br /><br />Of course we&#039;re all entitled to our opinion, but I really can&#039;t understand your criticism of Espresso 77.<br /><br />Are there any locally owned businesses in JH that you like?

				Haha I see I got on your nerves. <br /><br />&lt;your comments didn&#039;t make any sense to me.&gt;<br /><br />If I donâ€™t make sense to you donâ€™t listen/read. I think you just want to continue the argument.<br /><br />&lt;&quot;wannabe community cafe&quot;&gt;<br /><br />Whenever I pass E77 I see the same sort/kind of people and I donâ€™t think they represent whole â€œcommunityâ€. So calling it community cafÃ© by all the fan boys and girls is a bit off. Btw, communities happen on their own (sort of natural process) they cannot be created. I see a lot of people wanting to create a community.&nbsp; To me community in JH is all the immigrants and their 99c stores (99c is said metaphorically). Thatâ€™s the truth if you like it or not. If you want to create something you might want to look at suburbs -they are created as &quot;community&quot;<br /><br />&lt;I&#039;m also still interested in hearing if there are any local establishments that you like.&gt;<br /><br />What do you mean â€œestablishmentâ€? coffee place? They have great coffee in bagel shop on 37 ave and 86 st.&nbsp; &nbsp;I donâ€™t understand why you even care what I like? I guess you just wanna drill the discussion which to me is sort of pointless. I gave response to whether JH will become another gp/burg. <br /><br />Anyway, thatâ€™s my last post on this subject.<br /><br /><br />

				No one group owns Jackson Heights, or any neighborhood in NYC. Neighborhoods change. And when they do, some people like it, and some people don&#039;t. Jackson Heights started out as a country club community for upper middle class people from Manhattan. Now it&#039;s mostly immigrant. Tomorrow it will be something else. To argue about which incarnation is the real one is silly and a waste of time. <br /><br />My guess is that JH will continue to gentrify. As it does, it will become marginally less affordable. It will also gain more stores and restaurants that cater to people who frequent Espresso 77.

				There&#039;s an article in today&#039;s <strong>New York Times Real Estate</strong> section about Jackson Heights touching on this topic.<br /><br />A Migrantsâ€™ Enclave Attracts a New Breed (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/realestate/06living.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss)<br />By JOHN FREEMAN GILL<br />Published: February 4, 2011<br /><br />A WESTERN Queens neighborhood planned by an innovative developer beginning a century ago, Jackson Heights is a vibrant oxymoron: an enclave where much of the world is represented. Long a magnet for immigrants, the area today is dazzlingly multifarious: more than 30 languages are spoken, including Bengali, Korean, Spanish and Urdu. Nearly two-thirds of residents were born abroad, according to census surveys from 2005 to 2009. <br /><br />But over the last five or six years, brokers say, new arrivals from far-flung lands have increasingly been joined by young professionals migrating much shorter distances: north from Brooklyn, or east from Manhattan and the Queens neighborhood of Astoria. <br /><br />The ranks of these new buyers are thick with architects, academics, lawyers and artists. â€œThese are people who are not Wall Street types, and who tend to be creative professionals,â€ said Daniel Karatzas, an associate broker with the Beaudoin Realty Group and author of â€œJackson Heights: A Garden in the City,â€ a history published in 1990 with support from a local civic group. â€œFifteen years ago, this was not on their radar screen.â€ <br /><br />Projit Mallick, a lawyer in his 30s who grew up in Kolkata (previously transliterated as Calcutta) and Los Angeles, is one Astoria transplant. Drawn by the abundant prewar housing stock, Mr. Mallick in 2004 paid $295,000 for a three-bedroom co-op on 82nd Street with his new husband, Andy Theodosiou, a naturalized Greek-American raised in Astoria. Their 1,500-square-foot apartment is a distinctive space created by a previous owner, who conjoined a pair of one-bedrooms, turning the superfluous second dining room into a third bedroom.<br /><br />[<strong>Click on above link for complete article</strong>.]

				Anecdotally, I agree with the broker&#039;s observation in the article about new buyers in JH other than recent immigrants (as my family and I fit in to that demographic, as do many other people we know that have moved here in the last few years).<br /><br />I find it interesting that every article about JH real estate cites E77 (and recently Table Wine) as indicative of some big demographic shift in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I mean, we&#039;re talking about two storefronts out of hundreds!&nbsp; There has been considerable turnover in the last three years that has not resulted in more stores catering to the &quot;creative professional&quot; demographic...judging by new stores, there has been an incredible influx (or pent-up need) for people using chain retail banks!

				Sure we have too banks.&nbsp; But if it&#039;s a choice between a bank or a 99 cent store...well.... tough decision...NOT. Honestly, several of the banks that have opened here are pretty aesthetically pleasing (for me anyway..I love the original architecture of all the housing in JH). While the banks may have the money to restore, it does show they are making a commitment to the neighborhood. That&#039;s a good thing....and I think a sign that the neighborhood will continue to flourish.

				Going back to the original topic . . .&nbsp; I feel that the neighborhood will continue to evolve, primarily because the middle class is being priced out of Brooklyn etc., especially those folks starting a family and needing space.&nbsp; Some of the factors that are tempering the gentrification (for lack of a better word) include the limited public green space, the limited supply of rental units, and the commuting time to downtown Manhattan. However, overall, you have the housing, transportation, and commercial infrastructure in place to see significant gentrification over the next decade. <br /><br />I have lived in South Brooklyn and loved it while I was there, the food, the bars, the parks, the overall scene. I am now in JH and I love this place, albeit for different reasons. I love the Uruguayan bakery, the Polish deli, the tamaleras near the subway entrances, even a roasted chicken every so often. I will never go hungry in this nâ€™hood. I love that LGBT couples make up 20%+ of my building. I love seeing Tibetan ladies dressed in their traditional garbs. I like walking down Roosevelt and wondering what happens beyond all the dark stairwells late at night. I love that people in the neighborhood seem obsessed with having dogs as pets. I love seeing the teenagers make out against trees, cars, and entryways because they have nowhere else to go. I also like stopping by Table Wine and grabbing a decent bottle of wine come Friday night. <br /><br />I am not into the littered streets, nor into people not picking up after their dogs, nor into the calling cards handed out on weekends, nor into the lack of public greenspace, nor into the number of women with cosmetic surgery. I donâ€™t care much for E77 for some of the reasons expressed before, but I wish the owners all the best in making their business work for them. At the end of the day, none of these are deal breakers for me. Like any relationship, you take with good with the bad . . . .and overall there is lots of good here.<br /><br />I donâ€™t think JH will become the next Brooklyn (nor do I want it to be). However, it will change significantly, but in a way that builds off of what we have here. We will likely see more professionals, more money, more kids, but it will be people who appreciate and embrace the diversity of JH. Mind you, my sense is that many of the immigrants in JH are â€œmiddle classâ€. They may not be college educated or read the New Yorker, but they are hard working, take pride in who they are, are happy with where they are in life, etc. I think those folks helped JH become the safe and prosperous place it is today. <br /><br />My last observation, I get the sense that there are some people who moved to JH from Brooklyn etc. and either resent having to live here or resent not being able to live there. That sucks because they should live where they will be happy. I suspect some of these folks end up leaving JH, some just come to terms with the place and get past it, while others just keep hoping for the gentrification that has grabbed hold of Brooklyn etc. For better or worse, some of that gentrification is inevitable and likely sooner than we think. <br />

				Glad to hear about the handshake, I&#039;m still having a hard time seeing the difference between wanting <strong>A</strong> and wanting <strong>B</strong>, if neither A nor B are currently in the neighborhood, then their appearance would constitute CHANGE, and it doesn&#039;t really matter WHAT A and B actually are.<br /><br />

				OK, it is time to reveal what many of us have hidden for a long time:<br /><br />If you go into *certain* 99-cent stores or *certain* banks or *certain* hoochie-shirt stores, and if you go to the owner and offer the secret handshake, the back door will open and you will enter a secret back room of great, juicy burgers, gorgeous salads, and great beers on draft. I feel bad for allayouse who don&#039;t know the right spots or the right handshake, but I had to promise not to tell the specifics.

				My husband and I moved to Jackson Hts 5 plus years ago, not for its 99 cent stores but for it&#039;s diversity and it&#039;s potential.&nbsp; My husband is an immigrant from the Carribean and I am the granddaughter of one. My mother grew up 10 blocks from my current apartment. We are both college educated but are solidly middle class in income and ethic. Please, is there really something wrong with wanting besides 99 cent stores, bodegas and money transfers? The Spanish restaurants are wonderful, but noise and garbage and illegal conversions are not.&nbsp; Moderate gentrification is not the threat that everyone thinks it is.&nbsp; After all, isn&#039;t that the same thing that immigrants aspire to? They leave their home countries for a better life, a better home. They want their children to go to school, get good jobs. Worrying about places like Espresso 77 is pointless. Believe me, if someone wants to take the colossal chance of opening up a small business with the way the rents are around here, they should be supported.&nbsp; and doing&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve been there only a few times to pick up a coffee (yes, I admit it- I like good coffee!) and it seems like a modest and nice place.&nbsp; While walking my dog, I&#039;ve run into a guy who&#039;s also a musician who entertains there every once in a while:&nbsp; yes, he is hip because he&#039;s an artist, but he&#039;s also a husband and father. He works a in a city job to support his family .&nbsp; He came to JH because he wanted a nice place for his family to live. This is a normal guy, with normal concerns like anyone else.&nbsp; He&#039;s a decent guy and I want more hipsters like him in JH.&nbsp; Let&#039;s have some true diversity in Jackson Heights and make it a nice place for the people who live here and those who want to live here.

				I don&#039;t think JH is solidly middle class. Maybe in the historic district, but not where I live. Almost every time I&#039;m out at a local business, I&#039;m behind someone paying with a EBT card. That&#039;s not to say this neighborhood is &quot;ghetto&quot;. It&#039;s far from being anything like East St. Louis.<br /><br />Anyway, I Live Here Too makes some really good points. And DSSJH is entitled to her OPINIONS, sir. Especially in a MESSAGE BOARD thread asking people&#039;s OPINIONS.

				This thread should be joined with the &#039;Is this site too politically correct??&#039; thread. &nbsp; <br /><br />Every thread that had even a slight &quot;whiff&quot; of gentrification on these boards &nbsp;ALWAYS gets people bickering... &nbsp; And THAT gets censured by the Mods eventually. &nbsp; &nbsp;It cracks me up because I love good, heated disagreements sometimes. &nbsp;Oh well.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don&#039;t think JHs will undergo the changes like some Brooklyn neighborhoods for a reason already mentioned: &nbsp;JHs has more Co-ops and private houses then rentals. &nbsp;Hipsters usually are younger - &nbsp;(just starting out in the work force) - so usually poorer and more likely to look for rentals. <br /><br />And JHs is now possibly one of the more diverse communities in NY. &nbsp;JohnPrester, you like researching: what are the demographics here? &nbsp;So I think it will always have change (what place doesn&#039;t) but in the 24 years I&#039;ve lived here the changes haven&#039;t been that dramatic that I would compare JHs to say Williamsburg. &nbsp;Or Greenpoint for that matter. &nbsp; <br /><br />I love living here for the reasons: good and bad. &nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t want to be here if all the reasons were BAD. &nbsp;AND if all the reasons were GOOD, what would we discuss??? &nbsp;<br /><br />

				I love the diversity of Jackson Heights and don&#039;t really pay much attention to &quot;the color&quot; of the population here....BUT.... in the words of Mommy Dearest,&nbsp; &quot; I&#039;m not mad at you. I&#039;m mad at the dirt.&quot; There are some nice things happening.. the green market....Table Wine...Expres so 77....Film Festivals...the Play Street...and I really don&#039;t consider any of it a &quot;color&quot;.&nbsp; JH to me is inclusion..not exclusion. The gentrification of the neighborhood is the evolution of that. You&#039;ll find negative things here no doubt,&nbsp; but this is New York...and shit happens. That&#039;s what makes it fun!? I hope it continues to showcase the best of all of us. ...no matter what the color....just without the dirt.

				Are all white people the same? I think those that move out here may be a little more complex than the ones you might encounter in Williamsburg or the Village. The ones that move out here are going to tend to be the ones that appreciate the diversity of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Are Jewish people with white skin just &quot;more white people invading the hood&quot;? In NYC, Jews are numerous, but in the rest of the States, they are a very small minority. In that context, I would assume that an influx of Jews does indeed add diversity. What about Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, etc.? Are they being mistaken for &quot;more white people invading the hood&quot; when in fact they are immigrants with different cultures and languages and cuisines? &nbsp;What about the many South Americans who happen to have white skin? &nbsp;Many of the white people that I know in this neighborhood fall into one of these categories, and the rest are most certainly the type who appreciate all the diversity of the neighborhood.<br /><br />If you look back through the history of the neighborhood, there have been many waves of immigrants to this neighborhood, and Indians and South Americans were not the first. The character of the neighborhood will forever be changing slightly.<br /><br />Apart from the introduction of Starbucks and the proliferation of banks, I haven&#039;t seen a whole lot of changes for the worse hitting the neighborhood since I moved here 3 years ago. And there is a lot of great new stuff happening here.

				Lapdanson:<br /><br /><br />we all have different perspectives, of course. frankly, the neighborhood *hasn&#039;t* changed a whole lot since you moved here three years ago. it&#039;s changed a great deal since i moved here 15 years ago. even more since some of my neighbors moved here in the &#039;60s and &#039;70s. and no, i&#039;m not saying your perspective is less valid :)
