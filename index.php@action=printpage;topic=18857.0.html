While I don&#039;t doubt that something that advertises itself as an Italian deli will open in that space, I&#039;m skeptical that it will actually be an Italian deli. We don&#039;t really need something like JC Italian Deli again. I still have no idea what that place was trying to be, but it certainly wasn&#039;t an Italian deli by any stretch.<br /><br />I am disappointed that Appettito is closing. While their collection of sausages was small, they were always quite good.

				ClydeM:&nbsp; If it does become Italian, can you imagine how successful it would be if an established high quality&nbsp; Italian Market like Sorriso&#039;s of Astoria replaced Appettito.&nbsp; Whoever would have thought that SAC&#039;s of Astoria would open in Jackson Heights.&nbsp;

				something top of the line would be great. but sorriso is about five times the size of appetito -- which has no room to prepare food (they had a woman who brought in stuff she made in her home) and very little room for storage. we can hope for a good selection of meats and cheeses, and some packaged imports, but probably not a lot more.

For instance, a focus on high quality salumi and cheeses, with a few staples such as pasta as a bonus. There are stalls in the Arthur Avenue Retail Market, that are about the same size as Appittito that have a great selection. My favorite salumeria in Philly is even smaller but they have figured out how to maximize the space, and focus on high quality products (no Boars Head!).

				Agreed,&nbsp; I have the same concern with a prospective “#italiandeli”.<br />A proper Italian deli would be ok but even then, I’d miss their cabbage rolls, perogies, sausages,&nbsp; and all manner of treats. Even the rye bread was the best I could dependably find in the hood .&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; As much as I’d like to be that person that makes their own perogies and cabbage rolls I have come to terms with that never happening until maybe deep into retirement...<br /><br />Shop keeper says the rent isn’t to high- but the owner moved to jersey and couldn’t be bothered with the headache... anyone want to take over? keeping the same supply chain ?&nbsp; Not sure if understand the situation completely but doesn’t sound like a purely profit driven decision.

				it&#039;s not a profit driven/rent issue. she was increasingly stressed and tired from being a one-woman show, so she threw in the towel. it&#039;s understandable. 70 hour weeks are killer.

				That would be a perfect spot for a fish store.<br /><br />The neighborhood desperately needs a place to buy fresh fish.
