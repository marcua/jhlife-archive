				I think ‘Violence Plagued’ is hyperbolic.&nbsp; <br />But when I am out and about, there is a palpable undercurrent of tension, and controlled chaos.&nbsp; <br />We love Tacos Morelos on 37th Ave, but we always eat inside, away from the street.&nbsp; <br />In the past I would read these crime stories about JH, and say to myself ‘why are they in that area at 3:30am.&nbsp; Or why were they hanging around Roosevelt Ave at 2:45am’.&nbsp; <br />I felt like the crime was separate and removed from my immediate (historic district) -now the crime is happening during ‘normal’ hours and it seems to be happening everywhere. <br />

				And for what it&#039;s worth, comparing this year to last year is entirely pointless, so don&#039;t bother.
