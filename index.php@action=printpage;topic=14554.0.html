				I would say that is a lot of change and worth investigating why.&nbsp; Our co-op has employed the same managing agent for over 15 years.&nbsp; Perhaps the change in the board of directors has something to do with it.&nbsp; I would definitely question them as to their reasons.

				If they can&#039;t justify why they are changing so often (all these changes have costs, financial, time and stability-wise, as well&nbsp; as the reputation of your co-op!)&nbsp; - and they should be justifying, in writing, to the shareholders, who they work for........then get a new board!

				Have you looked at the board minutes to determine what the board is thinking? I know over decade&#039;s worth of minutes is a lot to look at, but that would be where I start.<br /><br />The annual shareholders meeting is coming up in a couple of months, so it might be worth addressing your concern then and looking for a reason from the board why the board seems to be perpetually unhappy with the management companies it chooses.

				well, howdy neighbor<br /><br />while your suggestion of perusing minutes is, in theory, an excellent one, the last time i considered it, several years back, the board required a trip to the management company (fairly inaccessible) during work hours in order to do so. worth my time, not my money. and who knows if minutes make the trip from office to office to office....<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=14554.msg69639.html#msg69639">Quote from: CaptainFlannel on March 17, 2016, 05:32:16 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Have you looked at the board minutes to determine what the board is thinking?

If you are unhappy with your board and feel they are doing an inadequate job, you are free to run for the board and do a better job! It&#039;s a bit silly, otherwise, to say you are unhappy and hope someone else steps up to the plate (which seems to be the more common approach).<br />

				Turning over management companies every two years is likely costing you money in what is probably the biggest financial investment of your life, so I&#039;d suggest it really might be worth the money to take a vacation day to visit the management company office. I think also if your building&#039;s board doesn&#039;t realize the costs the constant turn over is incurring on the coop, they might also not realize other things they are doing or overlooking that will cost shareholders in the long run, so a review of minutes might pay off in other ways. <br /><br />
