					Anyone happen to go there then? I was in Mr. O&#039;Neill&#039;s 7th grade class with some wonderful, intelligent and creative people, mostly in Elmhurst across Roosevelt Ave, but I lived in JH (89St). Just curious. I returned to JH after (gulp!) 70 years or so and would love to meet some kindred souls, interested in animal rights, earth rights, civil rights, the arts and the spiritual life.<br />I teach yoga, meditation, Pilates, Stretch and more. Was a professional modern dancer in my younger years. Ran an animal rescue group for many years. Am very committed to a healthy lifestyle, enjoy farmers&#039; market and organic food, cooking and am still - at my advanced age- teaching, in fact for NY Sports Club and privately.&nbsp; Would love to hear from similarly-minded folk. Thank you! Mrs. G. Mayer on 35th Ave/82nd St.

					I moved here a few months ago and teach in the City daily. I live near 82nd st 7 but rarely use it. I almost always use E/F even on weekends when they run locally.<br />I adore the 49 bus and take it home from 74th st most evenings. It is always mobbed from 8 am to midnight, or so I&#039;ve found. I&#039;m old, so I do get a seat!<br />If you&#039;re going to Bryant Park, take the F, as it is quick (weekdays, anyway). I actually took the LIRR from Penn Station today to 61 st and switched to the 7 from there. It was fun as a change of scene! And fast!

					I have been using them for a short while and their dairy, meat and general grocery items are fine.

					I&#039;ve recently returned to JH and was wondering if perchance any of my former classmates from 1950-51 might have also returned? We had a wonderful 7th grade class with Mr.O&#039;Neil and I was feeling nostalgic. My father was the local doctor in Woodside and we moved from 61st to 89st in 1949.&nbsp; I am a Healing Arts professional woman with a background in the Performing Arts.

					just joined so sorry the post has been standing still for months, but had to join in. Fields&#039; was wonderful, Jay Dee was the best and the cinema, yes of course. We all played in vacant lots as well as punch ball every evening till called in for dinner or bedtime. I went to PS 89 and miss my 7th grade friends so much; they were mostly in Elmhurst and all of us came from very educated but not well-off European immigrant families.<br /><br />My father was a surgeon at Physicians&#039; Hospital along with Dr Rappaport, if I recall correctly after 6 decades. I remember loving to walk the neighbors&#039; dogs and wander around 37th Ave as if it were 5th Ave in Manhattan, admiring the shops. I did the food-shopping for my mother and felt very grown-up doing that. For 5th grade, I went to what was then called Garden Country Day School, run by Mr and Mrs. Flower, then Mr. Roberts. I was happier in PS 89, however, where I had Mr. O&#039;Neill as my 7th grade teacher. He treated us like adults and instilled in us a super keen interest in Education. First time ever for me! And it lasted...

					Hello again, Bob; I&#039;m the yoga teacher, former dancer living in 3F. We met in the elevator a few times and your daughter said she knows the work of my son, who&#039;s a film-maker and former actor. My other son is a musician working and schlepping around the country with his synthesizer ...hard work but he&#039;s good at it. <br />I&#039;m sorry I missed your concert on Wednesday but I was teaching. As I told Alli, I teach Yoga/Pilates etc. for NY Sports Club but not in Queens. I&#039;d like to find teaching work here, especially private coaching in people&#039;s homes (or mine) as I did in the city for the past 35 years. Perhaps you and Alli could come down for a glass of wine some time, when we&#039;re not all working or doing laundry! <br />I just joined JHLife tonight, as I didn&#039;t know about it; I don&#039;t know anyone in JH yet, having recently moved in. But someone told me about it today and I answered a post who asked about living here years ago. I lived here in the Very Early 50&#039;s and went to PS 89, not 69. Not sure why! My father was the local Woodside doctor, a Romanian immigrant. We were the only Jewish family on our Woodside street and I always wanted to go to St Sebastian and wear pretty communion dresses like all the girls on my block. We moved to a semi-attached house on 89th st from Woodside and I loved the intellectual and cultural life I had here. My parents, typical of immigrants then and now, moved to a &quot;better&quot; area when I was in 8th grade (Jamaica Estates, which I detested) and I never had the same quality of friends after that until I went to HS Performing Arts in Manhattan. <br /><br />So this is my first foray into Queens as an adult and I&#039;m relishing all of it (except for the Con Ed folks outside my window right now at 2am). I have a very noisy toddler above me who runs for 2-3 hours each evening when she returns from wherever they take her for the day, and all day weekends. So I escape a lot when she&#039;s home. Sigh...the Office won&#039;t take a stand or even ask them to put down rugs.<br /><br />OK, sorry to ramble. That&#039;s what one does at this hour, I reckon.&nbsp; Hope to meet you and Alli again soon (on purpose, this time).<br /><br /><br />Gregg Mayer (Ms)

					Yes, I remember a LOT. We lived here on 89th st from 1948-51 and my father was the local Doctor, office in Woodside, surgeon in Physicians Hospital and almost all the other (now gone) Queens hospitals. I went to Garden School for 5th grade and PS 89 for 6th (horrible teacher) and 7th (fabulous teacher, Mr. O&#039;Neill). He probably was the greatest influence that led me into teaching. I subsequently taught university, secondary and primary school Movement in the UK and this country.<br /><br />We all played punchball in the street near our homes, hung out in vacant lots (remember those?), walked the neighbors&#039; dogs and went to some Carnival each Spring down by Northern Blvd (ferris wheel and lots of rides). All were a dime each ride, if I recall correctly. <br /><br />I have just moved back and would love to meet other long-ago residents.<br />Yes: Fields&#039; dept store (small by today&#039;s standards but very posh to my immigrant family&#039;s mind). Jahn&#039;s was in Forest Hills, not here, in my day but everyone had their local corner candy store and ice cream counter. Near PS 89 was Hampton&#039;s, where they let us read the comic books for free providing we put them back nicely, while we had lunch at the counter.<br /><br />We had BMT (now N,R) and IND (now E/F) and it wasn&#039;t the 32 bus but it Was the 15 double-decker bus that went from Manhattan to JH. We took it home a lot from my dancing lessons. I became a dancer and graduated from HS Performing Arts in 1956!<br /><br />I have recently dissolved my animal rescue organization but am always interested in meeting like-minded people with animal concerns, or interests in the Healing Arts. I am a certified yoga, Pilates instructor and a Yoga Therapist. I hope to meet new friends here, now that I am finally (more or less) moved in.
