				Jackson Heights is a great area to live. I grew up in JH and loving it. And I have notice home prices has grow significantly. Of course it&#039;s a good thing for people who already own. But what about the local JH people who are looking to buy for the first time or to upgrade. Will they feel price out? For example, few of the 2bed/2bath elm court or Hawthorne Court are listed at 669k last fall. And then this year they&#039;re are listed at 745 and 749k. That&#039;s $80,000 in creased in just 6 months time. I guess all the news and pr are really helping the price grow and making new people want to move in to JH. <br /><br />:)

				Someone recently made me aware of the bargains available in Riverdale.&nbsp; &nbsp;Riverdale has 90 units available under $200K and 123 units under $300K according to Streeteasy.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson Heights has nothing available under $200K and just 5 units under $300K.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I&#039;m not certain what the commute is like into Manhattan since I&#039;ve never been to Riverdale.&nbsp; It certainly is worthwhile looking into for someone retired or works from home.&nbsp;

				Riverdale is a quick commute, but not as convenient, since it&#039;s only served by one train (the 1 train). the housing stock is very, very nice, but there&#039;s not as much in the way of restaurants/shopping.<br /><br />i&#039;d also take a look at the location of the lower end places. like the folks who think 105th and Roosevelt is Jackson Hts, there are those who use &quot;Riverdale&quot; to signify anything close to the neighborhood.

				Riverdale also seems to have a ton of inventory available at all times, which hurts prices. but as said above, it&#039;s really not a convenient neighborhood. and while the prices are cheap, the coop maintenance&#039;s tend to be very high. so even if you buy a place in cash you always have a hefty monthly payment that will only keep going up and up.

				When we moved from Upper Manhattan 4.5 years ago, we narrowed it down to Riverdale vs Jackson Heights.&nbsp; There absolutely are very nice apartments quite cheap in Riverdale. I would not assume they are in bad parts of the neighborhood. But--the 1 train is far away from the nicest apartments, which are next to the Hudson River. People take a bus down to the 1 train. There are also express busses and Metro North--which you have to take a bus to even from close by, unless you want to walk down a long, steep staircase or down a long, winding road to get to the station. And trains don&#039;t run often except at rush hour. Thus--transportation is definitely more difficult and you really have to have a car in Riverdale. There is much more natural beauty, river views, parks, etc, than in Jackson Heights. But much less nightlife--fewer restaurants, cafes, and retail in general. It&#039;s more suburban. Plus many of the apartments are located close to the main roadway, often overlooking it, with associated traffic noise. All in all, we chose JH for its much better transportation options and much livelier street life and artsier, less conservative vibe. Also it&#039;s true that the maintenance fees are higher in Riverdale, but you do get parking, doorman, etc for those fees. So if you want a nice, big apartment with a terrace, river views, gym, sometimes even an outdoor swimming pool, parking, doormanâ€”you can get great deals in Riverdale without a doubt.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s the remoteness and the large amount of postwar hi-rises that keep prices on the low side up there.

				I think more local people in Jackson Heights feels price out in their own neighborhood they grow up in. Because more and more people from other area such as Brooklyn or the city can afford the price here without any hesitation. They can sell their one bedroom apartment with a decent price to upgrade to a two bedroom or three in JH. I think that&#039;s what&#039;s driving the price up in Jackson Heights because these apartments still sells even the price seems to be high.

				This is great news for the community. My wife is a JH native and she has seen the neighborhood change many times over. It&#039;s super affordable to rent/buy- has so many benefits- transit-proximity to major subway hub, the diversity, great restaurants, farmers market, close knit neighbors- I love it here but it&#039;s always good to escape the city- if you can. The past few years we have spent a couple summer months at our beach house and the winters in Cali- just to get away- I&#039;ve met many JH residents who have homes upstate so I find this to be pretty accurate. I also love the fact that JH lays in a historic district which cannot be compromised with luxury buildings- I think that&#039;s what Brooklyn and Manhattan are lacking in most parts, if you head to Clinton Hill or Williamsburg you often see the original architecture being masked by a hideous all glass luxury high rise. That will never happen in JH and I think that&#039;s swell.

I think it&#039;s also safe to say that it&#039;s true for land covered by apartment buildings outside the historic district. There&#039;s no way a coop or a large rental building full of rent-stabilized tenants is going to be torn down to build a high-rise condo. And much of non-HD Jackson Heights is full of those. I suppose there could still be some &quot;luxury&quot; development on other types of property--maybe by Roosevelt, Broadway, or Northern. But it won&#039;t be like what&#039;s happened in Williamsburg and LIC.
