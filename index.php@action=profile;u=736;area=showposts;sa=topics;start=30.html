					&nbsp;:tickedoff:<br /><br /><br />The people in the apartment next to mine frequently have their tv on at a loud enough volume to disturb my sleep at night.&nbsp; Usually, they turn it off around 12:30am, which annoys me since I&#039;d like to be able to fall asleep around 11:30.&nbsp; But last night, their tv-watching, louder than usual, went on until after 2am!&nbsp; At 1:40am, I finally knocked on the wall and asked them to turn their tv down (nicely, really), but they either didn&#039;t hear or ignored me.&nbsp; Then I got up and knocked on their door.&nbsp; No answer, and it&#039;s not like they weren&#039;t up, if the tv was on that loudly.&nbsp; They were probably looking through their peephole at me.&nbsp; I thought they had the tv on that loudly in the bedroom (all the way to the back of the apartment), but I heard it loud and clear through the front door,so it must be an especially loud living room tv.&nbsp; I went back into my house and it was STILL loud, so I went and rang the buzzer to their apartment, then went to their door.&nbsp; Still no answer.&nbsp; Are people really this inconsiderate?&nbsp; I am completely silent and don&#039;t disturb anyone, never play music and am careful to keep the tv down (only in living room, I don&#039;t even have one in my bedroom).&nbsp; If&nbsp; by some chance I was making noise and a neighbor came over to ask me to keep it down, I would simply apologize and lower the volume.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in this apartment for 4 months and have never complained before, so it&#039;s not like they see me complaining all the time.<br /><br />Any suggestions on what to do with a**holes like this?&nbsp; I&#039;m going to try knocking on the door today to talk to them, and if they don&#039;t answer, will leave a note.&nbsp; I know notes can come across as much ruder, but if they don&#039;t answer the door, that&#039;s all I can do.&nbsp; The thing is that right now, I&#039;m on vacation from work and not being able to get to sleep isn&#039;t the end of the world, but starting next week, my work schedule is going to get insane, as in leaving my house at 7:30am and not returning until midnight or later, and so I will need every little bit of sleep.&nbsp; And if they wake me up then, I will not be so nice!

					So, I&#039;ve officially killed my computer.&nbsp; It was already a few years old and virus-ridden and now I can&#039;t even get it to turn on (it&#039;s not reading the power source, even though it&#039;s plugged in).&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions on where I should go to buy a computer, and what to look for?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to get one soon, but will wait until after the holidays if there&#039;s a good chance I can get a better deal then.&nbsp; I have my work laptop, but I&#039;d rather just leave that at work and not carry it back home all the time.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard good things about Apple (is it really true that they do not get viruses?).&nbsp; I was thinking laptop,but now that I think of it, I wouldn&#039;t have any need to transport the computer, so should I do desktop to save money?&nbsp; Any brands to avoid?&nbsp; What kind of speed/memory, etc am I looking for?&nbsp; The only purpose for this computer will be for it to sit on my computer desk at home and I&#039;ll go online.&nbsp; I&#039;ll connect my itunes to it and download songs, but I won&#039;t be downloading anything crazy or excessively large, and there will be very little saved on the computer.<br /><br />Should I go somewhere like Best Buy or Circuit City?&nbsp; &nbsp;Buy online?&nbsp; Any local retailers I should know about?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any help you can provide--I am clueless!

					Just wondering if there are any places in the area that would be good for a first date.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking a place where it&#039;s ok to go and just get a drink or a cup of coffee.&nbsp; Has to be somewhere that is fairly quiet, but not creepily quiet where you are the only ones there.&nbsp; Maybe a bar with little tables to sit at?&nbsp; No dance floor!&nbsp; Also, as it&#039;s a first date, has to be somewhere that I can easily run away from if I decide I don&#039;t like him!&nbsp; That&#039;s why it&#039;s important for this to be a place where you can just get one drink, and the other patrons aren&#039;t all eating around you and it&#039;s weird if you don&#039;t order food.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

					I was visiting upstate NY a few weeks ago and came upon a store with beautiful Chinese decorations--like pictures, furniture, lamps, table decorations, etc.&nbsp; As this was upstate NY and there isn&#039;t a large Chinese population, it was the only shop in the area and it was very expensive.&nbsp; I assume that I could find similar items in Chinatown or Flushing that aren&#039;t as expensive.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer to try Flushing, because I can only carry so much on the subway, and I&#039;d rather drive.&nbsp; Does anyone know of items like this in Flushing?&nbsp; And--I&#039;ve never been to Flushing, so where exactly should I go?&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there a certain area I can go and park my car and be near several shops?<br /><br />Any recommendations?&nbsp; And while you&#039;re at it--any other places I should go in Flushing?&nbsp; I&#039;m really interested in trying the food also, but don&#039;t know where to begin.

					Does anyone know where I can buy a bag of woodstove pellets?&nbsp; Back in the day, I used to go to home depot and buy a 40lb bag for about $5.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a woodstove--I use the pellets as litter for my rabbit&#039;s litterbox (cat litter it toxic to rabbits).<br /><br />I&#039;ve already checked home depot on Northern for the pellets and didn&#039;t see them anywhere.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

					A comment from another poster about the price I paid for an Indian dish made me think...&nbsp; Are there good cheap eats out there that I should be trying first?&nbsp; Suggestions on all kinds of food (including dessert) and the location of the place in question would be appreciated.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in vegetarian, but I&#039;m sure others would love to hear meat bargains as well.<br /><br />My suggestions:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Maharaja lunch buffet--all-vegetarian indian buffet, from 12-4pm everyday.&nbsp; They will bring you naan or roti and then you serve yourself.&nbsp; Always a good selection of tasty dishes and I leave extremely stuffed every time.&nbsp; Always a dessert included as well.&nbsp; I believe the price is $6.99 on weekdays and $7.99 on weekends, but correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; King of Schwarma falafel cart in Astoria--Broadway &amp; 30 St, Astoria, right by the Broadway subway station (N/W), in front of C-Town.&nbsp; $3 falafel sandwich... so good, and the staff there is really friendly.

					I purchased the item below from Target.com 2 weeks ago, paid $99 plus $30 shipping for it.&nbsp; It was delivered to my home and I took it out of the box, tossed all the styrofoam that came with it, and started to put it together.&nbsp; When it was almost completely assembled, I decided to bring it into the bathroom to see how it would look.. and it is about 3 inches too wide to fit in the space above the toilet where it belongs!&nbsp; Boy, do I feel dumb!&nbsp; Now it is sitting on my floor in my living room and I&#039;d really like to get rid of it ASAP.&nbsp; I know I won&#039;t get my full $130 back, so I am selling it for $75.00 cash.&nbsp; It&#039;s never been used, and I don&#039;t see any dents or scratches on the pieces.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost assembled--just the cabinet doors need to be put on.&nbsp; I could easily unscrew the bottom part with the legs from the top cabinet part and it should easily fit in the back seat of any car.&nbsp; I&#039;d prefer that you pick it up (I live at 67th Street &amp; 41st Avenue, Woodside), but if you really want it and do not have a way to transport it, I have a car and could make arrangements to deliver.&nbsp; Link to the item:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.target.com/Classic-Wooden-%C3%89tag%C3%A8re-Glass-Cabinets/dp/B000BEPQKO/ref=cm_reviews_dp_seemore/601-4019301-2196117?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=&amp;frombrowse=1&amp;alt%5Fview=custReviews" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.target.com/Classic-Wooden-%C3%89tag%C3%A8re-Glass-Cabinets/dp/B000BEPQKO/ref=cm_reviews_dp_seemore/601-4019301-2196117?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=&amp;frombrowse=1&amp;alt%5Fview=custReviews</a><br /><br />Please PM me if interested.&nbsp; Thanks

					I just moved to Woodside (67th St/41st Ave) last month, and I haven&#039;t made my way out to the Manhattan bars late at night during that month.&nbsp; The one time I came back on a Saturday night at 11pm, I found walking down Roosevelt Ave&nbsp; from the Roosevelt Ave station to 67th Street to be a little creepy.&nbsp; And I thought I was imagining it when I would hear kissing noises when I walked around here, but a dirty guy actually leaned toward me (about 6 inches from my face) and made the kissing noise as I walked by!&nbsp; I wish I had pepper spray...<br /><br />Anyway, this Saturday night, I intend to be out until 2 or 3am and have no desire to take the subway home.&nbsp; I know it can sometimes be difficult to get a cab to Queens on a Saturday night (even though it is illegal for drivers to refuse to take you).&nbsp; My method is to get in FIRST and then tell them where I&#039;m going.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll be in Soho. What route should I tell the cab driver to take?&nbsp; When I lived in Astoria, i always directed them towards the 59th Street bridge.&nbsp; How about now?&nbsp; Queens midtown tunnel?&nbsp; Does that lead to the BQE?&nbsp; I really have no idea.&nbsp; I know my directions from the Triboro---would that be a feasible option?&nbsp; And if I direct the driver through the tunnel or over the Triboro, do I have to pay the toll BOTH ways?&nbsp; How much does a cab cost from Manhattan, anyway?
