				EAT THIS NOT THAT<br />&nbsp; Got this book at Barnes and Noble over at the Bayside Shopping Mall.&nbsp; It&#039;s great because not only does it list every chain in America with a page devoted to &quot;eat this&quot; and a page to the &quot;not that&quot; of their menu, but it lists holiday food choices, ethnic food choices, supermarket shopping (by brand name etc.)&nbsp; So now I know what I should eat no matter where I go!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Or mostly, what&#039;s the health consequence of what I actually choose to eat.&nbsp; :2funny:&nbsp; So, I&#039;m curious, what do u do if you&#039;re really trying to eat healthy and you eat locally to support neighborhood restaurants.&nbsp; &nbsp;What do you order when you&#039;re at, say Expresso 77, and the sandwiches are paninis??? High calorie and high fat.&nbsp; And forget Canelle Patiserrie.&nbsp; What can you get there if you want to try and eat healthy?&nbsp; Even with the book, I&#039;m terrible.&nbsp; And I do get a lot of rotisserie chicken.&nbsp;

				I love the salads at Taqueria Coatzingo (82nd St. near Roosevelt).&nbsp; And if you get the bread at Cannelle instead of the decadent pastries, it&#039;s no worse for you than any other bread.&nbsp; However, I can see how just the mere act of walking in the door there might lead you down a sugary, buttery path.

				You can get some pretty decent salads at City Coffee. I also think yogurberry is pretty healthy, being they are low is sugar and glycemic index. Also fresh fruit choices for toppings. Also like Starbucks for their healthy food choices-salads, low-fat sandwiches with the calories listed on the packages.

				I do want to try Canelle&#039;s bread.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been in to yougurtberry.&nbsp; When I stopped in Starbucks, their food section was empty.&nbsp; I thought it was because they were still getting it together.&nbsp; I&#039;m amazed at how many of you venture to Roosevelt Ave. to eat.&nbsp; In 20 years I&#039;ve only gone to Donovan&#039;s, El Sitio and recently La Flor.&nbsp; It seems too noisy and dirty so I just never go that way.&nbsp; Maybe that&#039;s changed and I&#039;ll have to just try.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard.&nbsp; Most of the local restaurants don&#039;t have many healthy options.&nbsp; Just really tasty fattening food... not that I&#039;m complaining.&nbsp; I&#039;m not overweight but my cholesterol is high right now.

				Taqueria Coatzingo is not actually on Roosevelt; it&#039;s on 82nd, but you have to cross Roosevelt to get to it.&nbsp; It&#039;s on the Elmhurst side.&nbsp; As for the places that are actually on Roosevelt, I agree that eating directly underneath the train seems dark and noisy, but it can be worth it!

				Thanks Shelby2.&nbsp; I may have to do something different and actually walk along Roosevelt Ave and check it out.&nbsp; Same for the Taqueria and Limoncello.&nbsp; It will be like living in a whole new place for me. wow.&nbsp; You, Chuckster and Kate seem more adventurous than me when it comes to exploring Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it has to do with when I first moved here and Roosevelt Ave. was the &quot;high crime area&quot; and I know it&#039;s been cleaned up by the 115 but old habits (of not going there) I guess, die hard.

				E77 soup and a roll are healthy. The tuna and chicken salads are not drowned in mayo. Be strong and ignore all those Ambrosia goodies! :police:

				Are you sure Coatzingo is NOT on Roosevelt? I go there all the time and I see the train above my head when I&#039;m standing at the door. I&#039;m fairly certain that is Roosevelt. Or are there multiple locations that I&#039;m missing?<br /><br />The one I go to is near 76th/77th Street.

				Right - I was talking about the one on 82nd, which is the one I go to, and the one that is closer to where Buddy lives in the &#039;80s.&nbsp; I should have mentioned there were two locations.

				I like going to places like La Boina Roja and Cafe La Nueva and usually order off the menu.&nbsp; In most cases, I&#039;ll order something like a grilled chicken breast and ask them to omit the rice and beans....delicious, but much too carby, especially when also accompanied by plantains.&nbsp; I&#039;ll replace those items with an avocado salad.&nbsp; I also like to ask what veggies are available for the day at La Nueva.&nbsp; It&#039;s always been something basic like cauliflower, broccoli, etc., but I like to spice them up a bit by pouring a little garlic sauce over them.<br /><br />You know, a couple of years ago I remember La Boina experimenting with assorted salads not of the iceberg variety.&nbsp; They even had a separate smaller menu dedicated to just salads and were selling them as meals, adding chicken or shrimp on a few of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, I&#039;m referring to the location in the 70s.&nbsp; Perhaps it was too early for them to try this so they discontinued it.&nbsp; Gustavo and his wife are super friendly, so next time I stop in and see them, I&#039;ll ask about it.

				La Cabana (Northern bet. 86/87) actually does have steamed broccoli or sauteed broccoli as a choice with entrees.&nbsp; It&#039;s funny because until I read the section in the book on Steaks, I always ordered a hangar steak with brocoli.&nbsp; Now I know it&#039;s one of the most fattening steak choices.&nbsp; I used to go to La Boina.&nbsp; Think they have nice cuts of meat but I felt like their meals were high calorie what with rice, beans, plantanos (love it all - cleaned my plate).<br /><br />I will eventually get around to trying all the places people on this site recommended because I really like eating out.&nbsp; I admit I make bad choices, not that all the places I&#039;ve gone to don&#039;t have healthy choices.&nbsp; I will go to La Nueva or Taqueria Coatzingo next lunch out.

				Is there a difference between the two Coatzingo&#039;s? I don&#039;t recall seeing many salads on the Roosevelt/76th menu. Perhaps that&#039;s the difference.

				I walked by Taqueria Coatzing on 82nd St.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Mexican joint.&nbsp; I would never think of Mexican for healthy eating at least not fast food Mexican.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually ate very well on my vacations to the actual country:&nbsp; fresh fish, fresh fruit, not much in the veggie category but mostly here in NY I think rice, refried bean, tacos etc.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have ever tried to going in there for a salad if it weren&#039;t for these posts.&nbsp; I feel like there are too many places I have to try.&nbsp; Stressful! ;)

				In healthy eating news <em>outside</em> Jackson Heights...<br /><br />A new &quot;whole food fusion&quot; restaurant called Tierra Sana (http://tierrasana.com/) will be opening on Thursday in Forest Hills.&nbsp; <br /><br />According to the press release, &quot;Stephanie Fiallo, President of Tierra Sana, has been a resident of Forest Hills for over 15 years, and is a true believer of a healthy lifestyle. Noticing the lack of nutritional options and a sense of unity in her community, she has dedicated her time and passion into creating and bringing Tierra Sana to life. It was developed to enrich the community with healthy, delicious food and positive energy.&quot;&nbsp; And speaking about fusion: It has a Native American chef, features natural and organic vegetarian/vegan food, and is certified Kosher.<br /><br />Definitely sounds intriguing.
