			I knew Billy Brennan very well if you are referring to the BB that lived in a great Irish family located on the north side of Northern Bvd in the low eighties or high seventies. I&#039;d been to his hours once or twice but can&#039;t remember the street. I was friends with him though our high school years and totally lost track after I went into the service in &#039;52. I heard something vague about him moving to Texas but have never confirmed that. If you have any up on him since 1952, I&#039;d love to hear about it. I&#039;m going on 86 so Billy has to be around that age, if he&#039;d still living. Contact me on my email address: greatpoobah@aol.com&nbsp; Be sure to put Billy Brennan in the subject box. My Name is Howard Giordano<br />
