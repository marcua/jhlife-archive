				Hello, neighbors!<br /><br />My fiance and I recently moved to the neighborhood (we love it). We were wondering whether there are any raw foodists or home-fermenters or homebrewers or kombucha growers in the area. If so, we&#039;d love to compare notes with you and maybe share some cultures!<br /><br />We are wannabe raw foodists, eating organic and raw when we are able. We&#039;re not crazies, however, and we do eat the occasional slice of pizza or tasty foods at local restaurants. We&nbsp; are not vegetarians, though we don&#039;t eat meat in quantity and always choose humane, healthy and (preferably) local sources. We are familiar with the Weston A. Price dietary guidelines, but we don&#039;t go overboard with that sort of thing, either (we drink caffeine and alcohol in moderation). We do own a copy of Nourishing Traditions!<br /><br />We are also avid fermenters and have made our own kraut and various brews in the past. We plan to make spicy kim chi in a Harsch crock in the very near future. We use a lot of recipes found in Sandor Katz&#039;s book Wild Fermentation. In the past, we grew kombucha for several years, and we want to get our operation started up again. If anyone has a spare culture sitting around, such a thing would be greatly appreciated! We also culture our own dairy and grow our own sprouts, when possible.<br /><br />The two of us want to get a beer homebrew operation up and running soon. We&#039;re both novices to this world, though, and so if there&#039;s anyone out there with experience who could offer some tricks of the trade, such information would be invaluable. We&#039;ve read a lot on the subject, but reading and doing are sometimes different things.<br /><br />I looked in the &quot;groups&quot; list and I didn&#039;t see any sort of organization in this neighborhood with these sorts of interests. Is there one out there? I wasn&#039;t sure whether to post this thread here or in the &quot;food&quot; section, so I apologize if I&#039;ve transgressed the forum boundaries.<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; :)<br />
