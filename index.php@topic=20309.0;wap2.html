			<strong>Lucys Massage</strong>:
			<br />
			Thanks for your ask LJR!!<br /><br />Every week, I take a covid test at 51 Street and Northern Blvd and the result has been negative. I ask the same of each person I work with.&nbsp; Temperature is taken at each visit and the room is ventilated and sanitized before and after each session. Mask is required by therapist and client. These are some of the practices implemented here. Let me know if you have further questions.<br /><br />Studio is located on 85th Street btw 34 Ave &amp; Northern Blvd and by appointment only. One session is $99 and until 12/24, the promotion is two sessions for $99.<br /><br />A massage session is typically 1 hour and I offer several types of massages.&nbsp; However, we can review the area you wish to address for a massage. The easiest way to accomplish this is in a 15 min phone conversation.<br /><br />Do I travel to a person&#039;s home? Simple answer is yes!&nbsp; We can discuss further after a 15 min conversation.<br /><br />
