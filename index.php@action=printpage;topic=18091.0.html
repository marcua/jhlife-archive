				A neighbor just told me about rumors going around that people on 79th St. are poisoning cats and kittens. Has anyone heard ANYTHING about this?

				79th and what ave? I&#039;ve never seen nor heard of poisoning cats. I did hear that someone was leaving rat poison near landing lights fields and dogs were getting sick. Do you know who told her this?

				She heard about it from a woman who knows many of the neighbors up and down 80th St. Apparently a mother cat and kittens were all found dead.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also we have two feral cats who come around our stoop, and one has mysteriously and suddenly stopped showing up for his twice-daily handout. The two may be unrelated, just wondered if anyone had heard about this, as well.

				Does your twice daily handout involve placing cans of food anywhere on the street?

				How horrible!! I will definitely share this information and hope the person is caught and charged with animal cruelty/abuse.

				I live on 79th street and know the people who care for the animals on the block, the one regular woman who feeds the cats has been for years and regularly takes them to the vet when necessary (she got a bunch of them spayed and neutered a while back, and another neighbor cared for them while they were all healing). The super for one of the buildings on the block has been caring for one of the street cats for close to 16 years (brings him indoors in the winter). Unless someone new has popped up on the block and is feeding the cats I would be very very surprised if any of the regulars were doing anything to the cats.

				One thing to keep in mind: Anyone who is feeding the cats by leaving cans of food outside is actually feeding the rats in the neighborhood and causing the rat population to grow. I live on 80th St. and someone leaves open cans of food in the gardens in front of the two buildings at the corner of 37th Ave., the ones adjacent to the dry cleaner and the yogurt shop. That&#039;s attracting rats.<br /><br />I spoke to a rep at the NYC Dept of Health about this issue and she says it&#039;s one of the reasons Jackson Heights has a higher rat population than many other neighborhoods.<br /><br />Please spread the word and discourage folks from doing this so your neighbors and their children don&#039;t have to dodge rats every day on the way to work and school.

				I don&#039;t mean to be contentious, but that DOH rep gave you a line of crap.<br /><br />Neighborhoods, rich and poor, diverse and non-, feed stray animals and wildlife. We are no different.<br /><br />It&#039;s not caused by global warming, either.<br /><br />We are a dense population and promote restaurants and eating on the go/on the street. We make a lot of garbage and lack adequate trash control, officially and otherwise. It&#039;s that simple.<br /><br />I do agree that putting out food for the cats isn&#039;t helping the situation; just not causing it.

				Cause may have been too strong a word. But certainly worsening it is true.<br /><br />Yes, there are other factors, especially trash.<br /><br />But in the one area of my block where canned cat food is left open every day...rats abound.<br /><br />So, yeah, it isn&#039;t helping.
