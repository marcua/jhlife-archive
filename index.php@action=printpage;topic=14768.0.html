				I agree that, although probably done with the best of intentions, it is ultimately animal cruelty.<br /><br />The woman, however, should not be arrested and thrown in jail.&nbsp; My guess is that these animals weren&#039;t &#039;abused&#039; in the traditional sense, and that she did care for them, but as was previously stated, the conditions they were ultimately placed in warranted the categorization as abuse.&nbsp; To me, the woman is sick and needs treatment, much alike a hoarder would.&nbsp; Placing her in jail would be equally wrong.

				I agree that this is a case of animal cruelty. Good intentions gone wrong. It sounds like she may have hoarding disorder and should seek psychological help as well. Poor fur babies. Hope they find good health and homes.
