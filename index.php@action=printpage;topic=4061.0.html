				<br />One of my favorite Thai restaurants in NYC is Zabb on Roosevelt and the other night, one of the owners told me that they&#039;re doing so badly this year that they might not make it past another six months if business keeps up the way it&#039;s been. :&#039;( Just wanted to let all you Zabb fans know... and for anybody who hasn&#039;t tried it, Zabb Rocks!!!

				How sad......... Zabb Queens IMHO one of the best Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I especially love the large selection of spicy crispy salads made with a variety of crispy fried meats such as duck, pork, chicken, catfish or shrimp topped with roasted peanuts and a sweet/sour/hot dressing.&nbsp; The noodle dish called pad khee mao is also a favorite in our household which consists of wide rice noodle tossed in a flavorful spicy sauce and top with cilantro, basil and bird&#039;s eye peppers (hot..hot...hot).&nbsp; They can adjust all orders to your heat tolerance.&nbsp; BTW they have speedy delivery service as well.<br /><br />Thanks jz23 for getting the word out.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stop in this week for dinner and tell my friends to do the same.&nbsp; :)

				I totally respect Zabb. I just don&#039;t go there too often b/c there are so many other places to try. Last time I went, we closed the place down at 2am on a weeknight. They don&#039;t get too much business though, If they were east of 74th, they might do better. <br />There is a new chinese place in corona, open very late as well, they were very busy at 1am on sunday night. pretty cool to see that.

				I believe this place has been there a couple of years. This is the one near 72nd &amp; Roosevelt? Food was good, but service/delivery so so. Zabb has opened restaurants in Manhattan and I believe Astoria as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;Menu had some things that were not found at other Thai restaurants...it specialized in &quot;Issan&quot; or northeastern Thai food.&nbsp; It&#039;s been at least a year since I had food from them. But, I just read on Yelp it has changed management...maybe worth trying again.

				The last time we called up they told us we had an old menu, and they didn&#039;t carry any of the things that we wanted (curry, noodles, etc), so we ordered from Rice Avenue instead.

				I had lunch there about a month ago...they have a limited menu during the day (basically a few choices of noodle soup).&nbsp; I had soup with duck and wide, handcut rice noodles&nbsp; that were delicious.&nbsp; They are fully focusing on &quot;Esarn&quot; cuisine from the north (or Issan, which is probably an alternative spelling as used above).<br /><br />None of the typical curries and dry noodle dishes...mostly soups with a vinegar / chili / fish sauce base (based on what I tasted) and rice dishes.<br /><br />FWIW, it always seems to be crowded in the evenings.

				I love Issan/Laos food so I love Zabb Elee.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only place I can get really spicy food like the kind I&#039;m used to.<br />The mixed papaya salad and larb catfish are great.

				You will have to go to the Manhattan branch if you want that food.&nbsp; The Queens branch has new owners.<br /><br />http://ny.eater.com/2016/6/13/11922836/zabb-elee-queens<br /><br />&quot;The original Queens location of critically-acclaimed Northern Thai restaurant Zabb Elee is now closed. The owners sold the Jackson Heights restaurant about six months ago, but they still operate a location in the East Village at 75 2nd Avenue, according to Nine Ramanya, an employee who transferred from Queens to Manhattan. The Queens restaurant’s new owners kept the Zabb Elee name for some time but will soon be reopening it under a new name. The new owners did not immediately respond to request for comment.&quot;

				The new management has been there for months. The last time I went there, the food was quite the same but the service was lacking. I think it&#039;s a bit more expensive too.<br /><br />If you wonder about the original chef, she has moved on since last year and opened her own restaurant in Hell&#039;s Kitchen, Esanation.

				Well that&#039;s depressing. The Manhattan location wasn&#039;t as good. My wife and I noticed it wasn&#039;t as good lately, probably new ownership. Sad.
