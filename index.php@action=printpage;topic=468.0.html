				Just wondering if anyone knows how the rents are in Jackson Heights compared to Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Elmhurst, etc.?&nbsp; I know the real estate prices (to buy) are higher in Astoria, but it seems like rent prices might be comparable.&nbsp; Sometimes I have friends looking to move and I would like to be able to advise them.<br /><br />I checked the nrvlowdown website and it lists the following averages for a 1-bedroom<br /><br />$1200&nbsp; - JH<br />$1231&nbsp; - Elmhurst<br />$1306&nbsp; - Corona<br />$1400&nbsp; &nbsp;- Sunnyside<br />$1417&nbsp; - Astoria<br /><br />However, I&#039;m not sure where these figures are coming from and I also know that doing an actual apartment search yields very different results than looking at listings online.<br /><br />

				<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font">Depends where in JH you are looking.&nbsp; In general it will be difficult to find a 1 bedroom for less than $1,200 in an apartment building.&nbsp; Honestly, I haven&#039;t seen any 1100 sq ft &quot;1 bedroom&quot; units in JH (or anywhere for that matter - I&#039;m sure they are somewhere but I haven&#039;t seen them).&nbsp; &nbsp;The size of the 1 bedroom unit will be closer to 650 - 825 sq ft and can be somewhat larger in Prewar buildings.&nbsp; Remember, many realtors exaggerate the actual square footage of units or simply are misinformed about their actual size.&nbsp; I am not implying intentional untruths but many simply may find it easier to say 800 sq ft than to say 735 sq ft or may ask the landlord and the landlord will pop whatever he thinks they are in size.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />While I don&#039;t like to deal with rentals I can say that I get a list every week in Jackson Hts from 2 landlords and they usually start at $1350 and up.&nbsp; As far as Astoria and Sunnyside is concern they will charge about $100 - $300 more for comparable units.&nbsp; &nbsp;I personally find Astoria units to be smaller overall than JH.&nbsp; In Corona you will find units to be cheaper in general than in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Some of the buildings in Corona, but closer to Rego Park can also be quite large just as the ones you see in Calloway St. (Very close to the LIE but 12 - 15 minutes walking distance to the Mall and trains))<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />&nbsp;:smiley6600:</span></strong>

				We have a one bedroom for rent in our building by a shareholder. It&#039;s going for $1200.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a good condition at all.&nbsp; I&#039;m shocked by it actually.&nbsp; But he&#039;s going to rent it soon.

				Thanks for the additional info.&nbsp; I was again asked just tonight by a friend of a friend about rental prices in JH and I said I thought $1400 was pretty standard for a large one bedroom.&nbsp; There&#039;s only one 1-bdr in JH listed on the Vantage Residential site right now and that one is $1625 for a 950 sq foot one bedroom.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I am assuming that even with rent stablization Vantage is doing their best to raise the rent prices up to whatever the market will bear, so I am guessing that the listings on their site are a pretty good barometer of historic district market rent prices.
