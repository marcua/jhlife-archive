				Hi,<br /><br />Does anyone know where I might be able to see photographs of 37th Avenue, especially from roughly the Post Office to 86th Street? I want to see how the storefronts were originally designed and how they looked over the first few decades.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Thanks iheartbigass,<br /><br />It looks like most of those links no longer work and that the tax assessment photos work only by individual address and for a fee per address.<br /><br />I am interested in photos that show the architecture of 37th in terms of commercial establishments.<br /><br />Anyone else?

				It looks like you could actually go spend a few hours over at the municipal archive and view the 1940&#039;s tax photos there for no fee, if I&#039;m reading correctly.&nbsp; You would have to look them up by block and lot number, but if you were really interested I don&#039;t think it would take too long to look up 20 or so addresses on ACRIS before going over there.&nbsp; For example, I just looked up the block and lot number for Kim&#039;s Brother fruit at 80-04 37th Ave and found the block to be 1291 and the lot to be 0001.&nbsp; <br /><br />The NYC records site says you can look up the 1980&#039;s tax photos (thumbnail size) for free online, but it doesn&#039;t sound like you are interested in 1980&#039;s photos.&nbsp; Still, if that would help, then you just have to go to the page for Queens 1980&#039;s tax photos and type a block number you&#039;re interested in (like 1291 from Kim&#039;s Brother fruit above) and you will find photos of the whole block from 1980.&nbsp; http://nycma.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/view/all?sort=Borough%2CBlock%2CLot%2CEasement (then make sure you type 1291 into the search box on the upper right). I&#039;m attaching a screen shot of what I found after I searched for 1291 and clicked on one of the images.<br /><br />Other than that, I would try to join some Facebook groups where people post photos from their own personal collections, like https://www.facebook.com/groups/queensnyhistory/<br /><br />Good luck!

				Here&#039;s one more from the 1980&#039;s.&nbsp; The blocks seem to be pretty much in order, so if you know even one block number, you can do +1 or -1 to see nearby blocks.

				Try contacting Daniel Karatzas, who wrote a book on the history of the neighborhood, which used to be available for purchase at E77 and may still be. He works for Beaudoin Realty. He spent years researching JH and gives an extensive historical slide show every year as part of the Garden Tour. I would think he would be a good source.
