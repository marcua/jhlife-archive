				I&#039;ve&nbsp; been waiting for it to open for a while - NOT because of the food, but because I was curious to see if it&#039;d impact the appearance of the block in any way and give it a different &quot;vibe&quot; if it were managed well.&nbsp; It commands a substantially bigger retail area than any other space nearby on Roosevelt and if were commercially brightly lit and kept spotless could change the appearance of the train station quite dramatically.&nbsp; But of course, I also recognize that it could go terribly wrong with inept management and make everything even worse - nothing is more of a depressing eyesore than a dingy looking fast food place. <br />

				:)<br /><br />i definitely would like to see vibrant retail in that space. i&#039;ve been living here 17 years and visiting for a decade longer, and it&#039;s been blah the whole time. i just wish it was someplace that offered something i might like -- and not someplace that will likely push out a competitor with a superior product (pizza don)

				Don&#039;t know if many are familiar with Trieste on Northern Blvd. just east of 73 street. It&#039;s owned by two brothers and has been in the neighborhood for years. It doesn&#039;t look like much from the outside, but it is pleasant enough on the inside and the food can be very good, a lot better than Armondo&#039;s in my opinion.

				do they have breakfast type stuff or just pizza in the morning?<br /><br />and I stopped ordering from Gianni&#039;s because they take so long, plus it&#039;s expensive and nothing special. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been mostly ordering from Daro&#039;s Pizza and Chicken in Woodside because they&#039;re on seamless, cheap (large hawaiian for $12), decent and usually pretty quick for delivery.

It&#039;s a long haul for them to dip into the neighborhood but it&#039;s the best pizza that delivers by far, especially if you like thin crust. I&#039;m talking the Brick Oven stuff, they also have regular crust as well I think.

				Although its been many years, I do remember that two other well known names also were interested in this site but Famous Pizza made the best offer.&nbsp; Two others were Starbuck&#039;s and Ottomanelli.&nbsp; This is an ultra prime location that won&#039;t be vacant for very long.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see who the next tenant is.&nbsp;

				it&#039;s a pretty large chain. i don&#039;t know if it&#039;s franchised or all company-owned, but if it&#039;s the latter, it could be that they&#039;re simply walking away.

				Well, pizza is certainly not lacking in this neighborhood.<br /><br />I suppose there is such a thing as too much pizza. <br /><br />I never ate pizza there but Famous Famiglia did light up an otherwise drab corner with its bright lights.

Ottamanelli also local of course but seems a strange fit for a subway station.<br /><br />I would imagine the rent is pretty astronomical though, so probably more likely something bigger. Maybe another Caffe Bene. I could see Dunkin Donuts doing a brisk business there too; the one by the 61st St stop on the 7 is always packed.
