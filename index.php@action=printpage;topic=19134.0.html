				Just a quick shoutout for a place that doesn&#039;t seem to get enough attention here. we were looking for dinner out after voting last night and thought this would be a good choice. <br /><br />it was.<br /><br />really crowded, but not uncomfortably so, for a Tuesday night. cool vibe. pop music soundtrack at reasonable volume, low lighting, and yes, television sets (for those who are frightened off by such things). simple, fresh seafood. excellent crab legs and shrimp. a nice &quot;boil&quot; sauce. bibs and gloves, crackers and digging forks like in Louisiana. copious dinner for two, two cocktails each, didn&#039;t break the bank. check it out - but expect a bit of spice.
