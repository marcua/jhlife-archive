				A bit of news about Sunnyside Yards redevelopment:<br /><br /><strong>City Selects Architecture Firm to Develop Master Plan For Sunnyside Yards: Report</strong><br /><br />https://sunnysidepost.com/city-selects-architecture-firm-develop-master-plan-sunnyside-yards-report<br /><br />The city has selected an architecture firm to come up with a master plan for Sunnyside Yards, the first major step since it released a study last year that considered the feasibility of a large-scale development over the 180-acre area.<br /><br />The Economic Development Corporation has selected PAU, a Park Avenue-based firm headed by notable architect Vishaan Chakrabarti, sources told Crain’s. Chakrabarti is behind the Domino Sugar Refinery project in Williamsburg and is also known for his work on Chelsea’s High Line.<br /><br />PAU declined to comment on the appointment, and the EDC said it has not officially designated a team, Crain’s said.<br /><br />EDC documents show the agency released a request for proposals for a Sunnyside Yards master plan in the fall of 2017, and expected to begin the one to two year master plan process in early 2018.<br /><br />The master plan is expected to shape a long-term vision for a future overbuild of the site, which includes figuring out a zoning framework, the development’s phasing, and which components could be built out first, according to the EDC.<br /><br />The feasibility study released last year says about 80 percent of the yards can be decked over, which allows for a variety of development scenarios to be built out. The study envisions three types of scenarios for the entire yard, which include residential, a live/work/play mix, or a destination type. All the concepts include thousands of residential units, schools, retail, and other mixed-use spaces.<br /><br />Amtrak, which owns most of the Sunnyside Yards, approached the city in 2014 to discuss the possibility of a large-scale development above the yards in 2014. Mayor Bill de Blasio has publicly supported building over the yards, calling it a “tremendous opportunity” to bring housing and other amenities to the area.<br /><br />(https://sunnysidepost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/sunnysideyards_Edc_1-768x513.jpg)

				Don’t hold your breath. The East Side Access has to be finished first. Which has gone way over budget and delayed. I think it is up to 11.5 billion and due in 2024. Building at this site will be very costly because you have to build a deck first.

				In area, Flushing Meadow Park is bigger than Central Park.&nbsp; And it&#039;s bigger than Prospect Park.<br /><br />I believe the fact we have no brilliant vision to get it up to the jewel-like standard of those other two parks (or any improved standard really)&nbsp; ...is no reason to continue to neglect Flushing Meadow... to create another park.<br /><br />

				Another update on the Sunnyside Yards:<br /><br />From the <strong>New York Times</strong>:<br /><br />Is a Rail Yard in Queens the Site of New York’s Next Mega-Development? (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/nyregion/is-a-rail-yard-in-queens-the-site-of-new-yorks-next-mega-development.html)<br /><br /><em>With a feasibility study already completed and a steering committee formed, the city will hold meetings starting in the fall to develop a master plan for building a deck on top of the yard and placing a small city — on the scale of Battery Park City — on top of it. The idea is not unlike the deck built over the rail yards on Manhattan’s West Side on which the Hudson Yards development now stands.<br /><br />The steering committee, made up of 41 public officials, business and community leaders, is discussing what should be built here over the next two decades — if anything at all. Infrastructure, transportation and traffic are being debated, as well as the landscape of the site.</em>

				Sunnyside Yard future debated at heated public meeting (https://ny.curbed.com/2019/3/27/18283753/queens-sunnyside-yard-future-heated-public-meeting-edc)<br /><br /><strong>The city aims to deck over the rail yard to build a megaproject larger than Governors Island</strong><br /><br />excerpt:<br /><br />The city is juggling that input and has begun to explore what a new community above a rail yard larger than the whole of Governors Island could look like.<br /><br />“This is a big stovetop with lots of dishes cooking at once,” Vishaan Chakrabarti, the leader of the project’s master planning consulting team and the founder of Practice for Architecture and Urbanism, told attendees Tuesday. “There are lots and lots of things we need to think about, from the rail system to building design, community input, transportation engineering, financial model—we’re trying to cook all of that at once to make sure we come up with a tasty meal.”<br /><br />To build over Sunnyside Yard, which is jointly owned by Amtrak and the MTA (with the city retaining air rights), officials would need to deck roughly 30 feet—or three stories—over the tracks. That could lead to unique ways to access the upper deck, such as inventive structures or grassy slopes. How to configure blocks for the new community is something Chakrabarti and his team are in the midst of exploring, looking at Barcelona’s famed superblocks, Portland’s tight street grid, and other cityscapes for reference.<br /><br />A feasibility study published by EDC in 2017 estimated the rail yard could accommodate up to 24,000 new housing units—4,200 to 7,200 of those below market rate—as well as new retail, parks, and schools. The study also raised the possibility of high-rise towers, but Chakrabarti said his team is looking into smaller, denser buildings to stray away from turning the new neighborhood into a mini-Midtown.<br /><br />“We’re looking at whether you could build more of a tabletop and spread more mid-rise—meaning 6- to-15-story density as opposed to 30 or 40 story towers,” Chakrabarti told the crowd. “That’s just an exploration at this point but it’s one of the things we’re interested in looking at.”<br /><br />&nbsp;click link at top for full article<br />
