				Notices are posted on 37th Ave about parking interruptions for Monday&#039;s filming of The Good Wife.&nbsp; Filming transportation will be parked on 37th Ave on 76th and 77th and between 83rd and 85th.&nbsp; Also much of 83rd St. between 35th and Roosevelt will be blocked for film parking.

				It looks like they&#039;re taking over 72nd/73rd/Brodway/37th to use as their equipment parking area. I&#039;m all for filming in the city and the neighborhood, but really? This is not, perhaps, the best location to use to park their vehicles.

				I&#039;m wondering how excited people will be due to the filming in general.&nbsp; About 10 years or so ago, Sydney Pollack and his film crew set up on 35th Avenue in the high 70&#039;s to film a few scenes for the movie, Random Hearts.&nbsp; It starred Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas.&nbsp; Most of the filming was done at the Colton Condominium on 35th Ave., between 76th &amp; 77th Streets, and some scenes were also shot on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Back then, the neighborhood was abuzz with excitement.&nbsp; That film crew also took up a major part of the side street parking.&nbsp; BTW, the movie was pretty bad.<br /><br />Above said, the Good Wife flyer says Monday, March 22nd.&nbsp; Can we take that to mean that the film crew will only be here for one day?&nbsp;

				Funny thing about that movie Random Hearts was that there was some sort of cra crash filmed in it thatw asfilmed on35th avenue.&nbsp; My friends who saw that scene live went on a VCR when it came out, slowed the scene down, and on the corner of what I think is 76thh and 35th you see a huge crowd of people just watching and waiting for the &#039;spontaneous&#039; crash.<br /><br />

				Have any additional no parking flyers been posted or just the two MarcusW and I posted, which cover opposite ends of the neighborhood?<br /><br />I noticed that the flyer they posted is similar to the sample one provided by the Mayor&#039;s Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting <strong>PDF</strong> &nbsp;(http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/pdf/resident_letter.pdf) however, there is one very important sentence in the sample letter that was left out of the flyers posted on our streets.&nbsp; There should be a sentence stating, &quot;Please note that vehicles left on these streets after TIME &amp; DATE may be relocated to a block nearby.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps this means they will not be towing vehicles that are in their way?&nbsp; If they are towing, I know they need to inform us about it in advance. <br /><br />On a more positive note, I hope everyone enjoys watching the filming!&nbsp; :)

				It looks like they were filming a scene at the entrance of Subzi Mandi on 73rd as I was heading to work.
