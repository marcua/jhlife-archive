				What stores do people find have the best produce in the neighborhood?<br /><br />Of course my first choice for buying produce is the farmer&#039;s market, but beyond that: What&#039;s second best?<br /><br />I come away from most supermarkets in the area disappointed. Lemon Farm has some nice stuff, but pretty limited selection.<br /><br />Especially interested in places that have organic produce.

				depending on what you&#039;re looking for, i like the former Pacific market, now New York Market, on Broadway/75 for basic veg, and both the larger Indian places as well. fruits, not so much, but veg, thumbs up

				I used to like Lemon Farm but they have gone downhill.<br /><br />Best bet is Growing Farm on 37 between 76 and 77. Real oldschool fruteria with lots of selection and great prices

				I like both Growing Farm and Kim&#039;s Brother. Kim&#039;s Brother is on 37th between 80th and 81st on the south side. <br /><br />The Downtown Natural Market on 37th/84th St. carries organic fruits and vegetables, but prices can be high as you might expect.

				I find bananas today to be generally lousy. For 10 - 30 cents more per pound, it is worth it to buy the organic ones at Downtown Market at $.99/lb.<br /><br />I love Downtown Market and appreciate that it is located centrally within the JH district.

				the banana problem is not going to be solved. there have been lots of stories about the impending extinction of the variety we currently eat most often -- something that happened to the previous variety, which died out in the early 1900s.<br /><br />it&#039;s partly overuse, partly climate change, and we need to think differently about how we use them.

				Agree with what&#039;s been said previously, and I just want to add Patel Brother&#039;s to the mix- I often get produce basics there: greens, onions, garlic, citrus, herbs.&nbsp; High turnover, so produce isn&#039;t sitting and going bad. Prices are excellent and I think quality exceeds many other local options (the greens and herbs are especially great!)<br /><br />re: the health food store on 84th and 37th ave- I go there for certain pantry goods that can&#039;t find elsewhere (almond butter etc) but I&#039;ve been unimpressed with their produce. Prices are exorbitant and while I&#039;m willing to pay more for organic or small farm, I think because maybe it&#039;s not a high traffic store items sit and mold, etc. And the selection is quite small. In terms of dry and pantry goods, they do offer a lot of products that you&#039;d be hard pressed to find elsewhere in the neighborhood though. <br /><br />

				Farm Spot, the Jackson Heights CSA (community supported agriculture) offers very fresh, local, organic produce for half the year. The season starts June 1st and runs into November. Deadline to sign up is May 18th. (Of course, it&#039;s not the same as buying produce at a store, but since it&#039;s timely I thought I&#039;d mention it!) :) <br />farmspot.org <br /><br />-- Sonya

				it depends on the item. for vegetables that are widely used in south asian cooking - peppers, different squashes, tomatoes, greens -- Patel is definitely fresher and better. other things, not so much.<br /><br />onions are my biggest yardstick of freshness, and i&#039;ve never gotten a bad one at Patel or Subzi Mandi. i&#039;ve gotten lousy ones -- you know, the brown, slimy center -- at just about all the other spots along 37th. that&#039;s always a bummer for me.

				agreed- you won&#039;t necessarily find everything at Patel&#039;s that you would at Foodtown, but when I know my ingredients will be there I go to Patel&#039;s b/c I do find the quality reliable (more so than Foodtown/dynasty).

				That new fruit/veg spot on 37th between 83rd and 84th is quite good. The people working there are always friendly and the produce is always fresh.<br /><br />On another note, I make a point of NEVER buying produce from the Downtown Natural Market. Not only is it highly expensive, but the owners tend to follow you around the store like you&#039;re a criminal. I hate that. Also, &quot;organic&quot; is a very loose term these days.

				I visit them all during the week to see who has what I want that looks good, and for how much. Would add the one (Mango?) on 82nd Street where the construction sheds are, and the one further towards Roosevelt (sorry, name escapes me) which has the best price on mushrooms.<br /><br />The new one on 37th has the attraction of space - nice to be able to move around.<br /><br />Should perhaps add that it combines with my walking program. Not everyone would have the time, I know.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />
