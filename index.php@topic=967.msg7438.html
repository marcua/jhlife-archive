JMP99 does make a statement about co-brokering that as I mentioned, in theory works best to secure the highest offer possible for the seller and ultimately benefits the Industry&nbsp; In the businesses that I am involved in it would be unforgivable to simply start naming other realtors or environmental/construction firms in an attempt to trash them.&nbsp; Many may not agree, but that&#039;s what opinions are about.<br /><br />I think 80thstreet got what 80thstreet got out of the posting and it&#039;s OK.&nbsp; I think that my rebut touched on too many issues and I did not address the issue specifically. I also failed to quote JMP99 so that the &quot;loss in translation&quot; was evident.&nbsp; There is such a thing as too long a posting and I certainly crossed that line a long time ago...LOL&nbsp; It would take a whole lot of witting to get my views understood and even then, unless you have been there it may still be foggy. Ever heard of &quot;reading between the lines?&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly what I did and I felt it necessary to unmask the posting for what I believe it really was and I will not apologize for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets&#039; start with the co-broker or cooperating broker and the antitrust mentioned.&nbsp; By JMP99 stating that the mentioned local agents do not co-broke JMP99 simply showed disregard and in my opinion total disrespect for these hard working local brokers.&nbsp; Many of these agents co-broke but instead of putting it up in the MLS (in this case or Queens LIBOR) they choose not to waste their time and go right to the source...LOCAL REALTORS THAT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE QUALIFIED AND SERIOUS, READY TO DEAL BUYERS, NOT POSERS. I also wrote that many realtors will ask that their buyers show proof of funds and / or a pre-qualification before they show.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing wrong or illegal about that, regardless of what you may have been led to believe (am I reading between the lines???)&nbsp; I also think that any realtor showing properties to buyers of other agents without a pre-qualification letter or proof of funds is simply not looking out for the best interest of their clients and is setting themselves up for a whole list of abuse in the business.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now going into giving myself credit...again what I posted was that I witnessed the abuses of Board and that unfortunately many local realtors have an edge over the &quot;outsider&quot;.&nbsp; As a byproduct of my posting I did many things but giving myself any credit was one thing I did not...LOL.&nbsp; Let&#039;s see, if I wanted to give myself credit I would have posted something like...&quot;list with me, I will find a buyer and I will get him approved by your Board&quot;...Now that would be crazy talk 80thstreet.&nbsp; In fact, I want to repeat that I GENERALLY DON&#039;T LIST PROPERTIES UNLESS THEY ARE SPONSOR OWNED UNITS.&nbsp; On occasion I will list a resale but only if I know the Board is fair and I am confident I can get someone approved without racism or prejudicial elements.&nbsp; Your building may follow a fair and level SOP for allowing shareholders but the realities of many other buildings differ from yours.&nbsp; I will not name certain Buildings because then I would be doing the same thing I posted against, posting names as if that would have no repercussions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am totally aware that different Coops observe different requirements but even then not knowing the Building can complicate matters. Yes, many Coop Boards are as fair as can be but many, and I mean many are guilty as charge.&nbsp; I believe that I made it clear that I have found myself hand picking resales because these practices are still rampant. I can write, not one posting but a books worth of the abuses that still exist in several Cooperatives.&nbsp; I have to admit that JH Cooperatives are a lot more compliant to the federal laws as it pertains to the &quot;protected classes&quot; but we are still a long way from equality and a level play field.<br /><br />Finally (for now, I think 80thstreet is going to keep me busy and 80thstreet did bring valid points to this subject) IT IS MY OPINION BASED ON CERTAIN REALITIES, it is better to know someone in the Board, or the Mgmt or at least some other shareholders that can expand your knowledge of the Building.&nbsp; This is important because offering plans, amendments, house rules and the financials are not going to tell you anything about the Building&#039;s admissions committee.&nbsp; Based on this very personal opinion that is something that is not likely to be happen with an outside broker. </strong> </em> </span> <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />NYC Native:<br /><br />It&#039;s an arduous task to follow your lengthy posts.&nbsp; You are incorrect by stating that I â€œsimply showed disregard&quot; for local realtors.&nbsp; To write that local brokers do not co-broke their listings is a fair criticism, not an attack, as you characterize it.&nbsp; This type of anti-competitive ideology is not so much about the survival of small firms anymore â€“ itâ€™s really about cashing in at the expense of an uninformed seller.&nbsp; Furthermore, when brokers donâ€™t allow the real estate community to participate in deals, i.e. â€œsharing commissions,â€ it hinders competition and ultimately retards prices.<br /><br />In Manhattan 99% of all residential real estate transactions are done as a result of co-brokering.&nbsp; Again, you are completely wrong by stating that co-brokering works only in â€œtheory.â€&nbsp; Also, a professional broker does not need to know co-op board members to do deals in different buildings. In fact, a knowledgeable, half-intelligent broker should be able to do deals in any borough and any building.&nbsp; NYC Native, your perspectives seem near sighted.<br /><br />Jackson Heightsâ€™ sellers:<br /><br />You need to know that co-brokering or when brokers invite the entire real estate community to bring their customers and participate in a sale, is essential to getting the best price for your properties.&nbsp; Donâ€™t believe the hype.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_7332">I agree with jmp99.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with discussing the practices of local real estate firms <span class="bbc_u">by name</span>, whether the practice is good or bad.&nbsp; If NYC Native wants to be professionally courteous to his fellow brokers, that is certainly his choice.&nbsp; From my reading of jmp99&#039;s posts, there was no attempt to smear the character of any realtor.&nbsp; Even if jmp99 did discuss local real estate firms by name, jmp99 simply wrote about his or her understanding of the practices of local real estate firms.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think NYC Native again avoided the question of whether local real estate firms engage in anti-competitive practices.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the questions posed was: Whether local real estate agents engage in the practice of screening out offers or interests from potential buyers that are not represented by other local real estate agents.<br /><br />This question relates to anti-competitive behavior and possibly antitrust issues because if local brokers will only work with other local brokers in an (whether intentional or not) to keep larger agencies and non-local brokers from competing in JH, then the result may be: (1) sellers may not see a better offer (or even a higher offer) simply because a potential buyer was not represented by a local broker; (2) buyers won&#039;t have access to the market of JH properties without having to go through a local broker; (3) non-local brokers are unwilling to compete in marketing JH properties because they know they are being shut out by local brokers....all three results are a detriment to sellers and buyers alike!&nbsp; <br /><br />My reading of NYC Native&#039;s response seems to be that local brokers are somehow more likely to produce buyers that are <span class="bbc_u">serious </span> in their decision to buy and are more <span class="bbc_u">financially qualified</span>.&nbsp; This just does not seem true to me.&nbsp; First, asking a potential buyer to produce a letter from the bank to show that the potential buyer is pre-qualified is something ANY broker (local or non-local) can ask for.&nbsp; No one on this thread even suggested that a broker asking for a pre-qualification letter was somehow engaging in anything illegal or anti-competitive.&nbsp; So, NYC Native, this is not a matter of seeing things &quot;from your angle&quot;.&nbsp; Second, taking Manhattan as an example, I don&#039;t think a broker that works mostly in the Upper East Side is somehow going to produce buyers that are any more serious than buyers being represented by brokers that work mostly in Soho.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, my conclusion seems to be that NYC Native is dodging the question about possible anti-competitive behaviours by local brokers and trying to characterize the discussions on this thread as some kind of slander against individual local brokers.&nbsp; This is simply not the case.<br /><br />I&#039;d be HAPPY (even ecstatic)to find out that local brokers are NOT engaging in anti-competitive behavior.&nbsp; But if this is true, I&#039;d like it to be backed up by a little more than arguments such as (a) &quot;theories&quot; don&#039;t pan out, and (b) this discussion is &quot;trash talking&quot; other people.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

There is a degree of knowledge that can be gained by opening your eyes and mind to certain realities of the RE business that you obviously cant get from simply reading articles or &quot;breaking news&quot;.&nbsp; This may not be your fault since your experience in this Coop business may limited to serving on a Board and surfing the web.&nbsp; Maybe I am wrong and you do have more experience than what I give you credit for but they are so different than what I have experienced and your mind set is what it is.&nbsp; I can&#039;t believe that an obviously educated person like yourself can&#039;t see an innuendo when its written.&nbsp; If you think that it&#039;s OK to say &quot;this person doesn&#039;t co-broke&quot; or &quot;that person won&#039;t do this&quot; when in fact the statement lacks substance or is a TOTAL LIE than you had me fooled.&nbsp; I have had 2 of those Realtors email me and call my office to help sell their units.&nbsp; They offered splits I found almost offensive since they were charging low and sometimes grossly discounted commission.&nbsp; Some actually offered more realistic splits but again, it&#039;s not what I do.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t&nbsp; list re-sales, it&#039;s just not what I do.&nbsp; I deal with No-Board approval listings and it is the wishes of the SPONSORS that I deal with we do not MLS their units.&nbsp; At first I failed to see the wisdom of their wishes but soon I understood the method to the madness.&nbsp; We have consistently raised the value of our apartments and sold them much faster then most others would have selling the traditional way.&nbsp; I stand my ground, LOCAL REALTORS have an advantage to the outsiders and co-brokering should be offered but with very clear guidelines and methodology so as to avoid wasting everyone&#039;s time.&nbsp; This the option of the brokers and sellers but somehow you&#039;ve made it a &quot;antitrust&quot; issue because you brought it up and this is simply not the case.&nbsp; Sometimes sellers give the listing to every realtor in the area thus co-brokering is almost an impossibility since the listing is an &quot;Open Listing&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Folks, listen and hear the facts and not the HYPE!&nbsp; I am not a person you would call to list a property because this is not what I do.&nbsp; I encourage sellers to list with local brokers that may use or not the MLS their units but do not make the mistake of listing with someone outside your area just because they are a biggie and they are using the MLS.&nbsp; This won&#039;t sell your units, active marketing and hard work will.&nbsp; I personally know of a few biggies that simply listed properties and rarely did any selling.&nbsp; Their ideology was that if they listed 100 properties, throw them in the MLS pool and sold 10 themselves and co-broke 30 they were way ahead since they were getting paid anyway and didn&#039;t have to keep a big staff on.&nbsp; Whatever happened to the other 60 properties?&nbsp; They would re-list it with a lower price or the sellers got smart and went with an active local broker.&nbsp; <br /><br />The market is much different now a days but Coops are selling well and places like Jackson Heights will continue doing well as long as they are reasonable priced.&nbsp; My argument stands, even when local brokers don&#039;t officially co-broke they actually do most of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes they may wait a few days to call buyers that may be waiting and when they exhaust these option (usually a few days) they start calling local realtors to offer a co-broke.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with that or illegal for that matter regardless of what you read in Blogs.&nbsp; MLS is a great way to cover all bases in the marketing strategy but I always like to demystify any subject matter that I have <span class="bbc_u">real knowledge </span> of.&nbsp; I can go on and on about why brokers do this or that or why people&#039;s mind sets are what they are.&nbsp; But only experience and hands on can truly define the realities of any field or subject.<br /><br />As per &quot;dodging the question&quot;<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; What question?&nbsp; You seem fixated on this unrelated subject and have not read my entire posting and shoot from the hip like a cowboy on a mission.&nbsp; You can&#039;t make a proper assessment of what is posted by speed reading.&nbsp; I write with facts and not with something that is in the news and on the net and now <span class="bbc_u"><em><strong>&quot;I&#039;m an expert on the subject&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> </em> </span> Many times our government misses the target and sometimes by a long shot.&nbsp; True, there are those that have gone the wrong path and have engaged in unethical and questionable practices, but there is another side to some of the stories you read.&nbsp; Overzealous ADA&#039;s trying to make a name for themselves sometimes amplify certain truths to monumental heights.&nbsp; That&#039;s why some laws are deemed unconstitutional and Rules and Regulations are constantly being revised and changed to rectify or to right a wrong..&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a good intention mushrooms to a witch hunt faster than I can finish up a whole bottle of Montepulsiano.</span></span><br />&nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />&nbsp;
