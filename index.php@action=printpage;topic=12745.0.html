				I&#039;m no expert but here goes:<br />I order delivery from Indian Taj, largely because they&#039;ll deliver up to me. I like their food. <br />I bring out of JH guests to the buffet at Jackson Diner. It&#039;s also decent, but they have a wide variety, it&#039;s cheap, and you can always get a table. <br />Both of the above are what I call &quot;American-Indian,&quot; typical dishes you can get anywhere that are no doubt tailored to American tastes, but I&#039;m American, and I like it. <br />I go to Dosa Delight for dosas and other South Indian fare. They&#039;ve never disappointed, but they&#039;re a bit small and get crowded at times. <br />If I don&#039;t have the kids with me, I&#039;ll take my wife to Delhi Heights. They&#039;re a bit more upscale, and they also have Chinese-Indian food. <br />A Pakistani friend of mine swears by Dera, especially the goat, but I haven&#039;t personally been there.

				I&#039;ve been missing Indian food from my takeout routine ever since Mehfil closed down. However, I recently went with a large group to Samudra on 37th Avenue and was impressed by all the dishes we had sampled there that evening. However, it is strictly vegetarian only, so I&#039;m still looking for a place to get my Tandoori&nbsp; and Chicken Tikka Masala/Vindaloo/Biryani fix.

				i never understood the love for Mehfil ... always struck me as suburban mall Americanized Indian stuff....no depth or nuance. my faves have all been gone for a while -- Grameen, where samudra is now, was pretty awesome, as was the original jackson diner (where al-naimat is now). but i actually like al-naimat a lot for carryout, the veg dishes more than the meat, although the haleem is excellent. delhi heights is reliably good, as is samudra.

				Ed, I work near Aanchal and have enjoyed their buffet. They also have a nice atmosphere (something Jackson Diner could work on. Their bathroom IS kind of icky.) <br /><br />I was also kind of &quot;meh&quot; on Mehfil, although I only tried them once.

				I really think Dera is by far the best here as a complete restaurant. That&#039;s if by Indian, you mean to include bangladesh and pakistan, which I think you should if you consider the buffets as Indian. A question is, should you consider Nepali as Indian too? I do not know. <br /><br /><br />I also love abdullah, everything tastes so good there and the people are very nice. I have probably gone there more than anywhere else in the past year because 1-its so close to my apt, 2-I get half orders of great biryani for $4 or so and I&#039;m happy. I always get half orders at all these places, it is so essential.

				momos comes from the north, most of the other cuisine comes from the south. It&#039;s so easy to eat at nepali places, just order a thali plate. You get about 5 or 6 things on a plate, and a lot of them are refillable with the non-main dishes. Def try Laliguras for casual, woodside cafe is great too. dhaulagiri i think is in limbo. can&#039;t go wrong with a thali.

				delhi heights has slipped a bit over the years, but i still like it as well. i think people will have stories of grossness everywhere. i saw a family of cockroaches under the table at a very high end steakhouse on one visit eight or nine years ago, for instance.

				I would avoid going to the rest room in any of the Indian Restaurants in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; There are many restaurants in the neighborhood where they often seat you without really cleaning the table from the last customer (a dirty napkin does not count). I always ask the waitress to clean the table.<br /><br />As far as food quality, I stopped going to Jackson Diner many years ago--although it was the first place I went when I first came to JH--mainly because the food was not that good. Unfortunately the quality of Indian/Pakistani food has gone down in the neighborhood...it seems that Curry Hill in Manhattan has had a resurgence of good restaurants.&nbsp; Here in JH I tend to go to Dera (72nd &amp; Bway) for more authentic Pakistani food and sweets and Dosa Delight or Samudra for Indian vegetarian.&nbsp; I want to revisit the buffet at Dehli Delights, it was very good when they first opened, but think this place may have changes hands.&nbsp; Most of the new restaurants down there are Nepalese/Tibetan--Phayul and Spicy Tibet are both very good.
