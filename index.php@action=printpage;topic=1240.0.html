				**I&#039;ve copied this from the garbage thread and put it here.&nbsp; I have to admit, I think this is a silly, non-topic but whatever:**<br /><br /><br />And while people have brought up birds...&nbsp; does anyone know if people who throw food out all over private property every day for birds are breaking any laws?&nbsp; There&#039;s a lady who pushes a shopping cart every morning around 34th Ave. in the upper 80s and she throws seed, peanuts etc. EVERY WHERE.&nbsp; I&#039;ve asked her not to come and do it at our building and she hasn&#039;t but she does it right across the street and on the sidewalk etc.&nbsp; I know there are more important things in life to deal with but I do think it doesn&#039;t help when we&#039;re talking about cleaner streets.

				I am definitely a bird lover (my grandparents used to breed budgies), and agree with both Bert and Hoodsie that pigeons are fascinating and even beautiful creatures.&nbsp; But before Buddy scowls at me for making nice, let me hasten to add that I think the true promulgators of filth and disease in this case are the misguided individuals who feed them.&nbsp; Except for a few hawks and speeding taxis, pigeons have no predators in the city.&nbsp; Their population is limited only by their food supply.&nbsp; People who feed pigeons are fostering their overpopulation.&nbsp; It is an act of cruelty, not mercy.&nbsp; And it should be criminalized.&nbsp; I think people who spread seed in the city should be cited for littering, and property owners (like those on 75th and 76th Streets, where this is particularly rampant) should be cited if they don&#039;t clean up seed that is spilled on their sidewalks.&nbsp; <br /><br />London has been having a huge controversy about this issue:<br />Pigeons May Coo but They Aren&#039;t Cute, the Mayor Says (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/20/world/20pigeons.html)<br />Hawks Do Their Worst, But Cost of Pigeon War is Problem for Mayor (http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/sep/29/uk.localgovernment)<br />Save the Trafalgar Square Pigeons (http://www.savethepigeons.org/)<br /><br />And watch out for those &quot;rogue pigeon fanciers&quot;!<br />Pigeon fanciers blamed for trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4029413.ece)<br /><br />UPDATE: Even Bert agrees that pigeons don&#039;t like us to throw things on the ground (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7XQEiN_Vxk).<br />

				Even though I don&#039;t want the pigeons on my terrace, I would not hurt them ( maybe ).&nbsp; &nbsp;Years ago without my knowledge, one nested behind a large plant that I had.&nbsp; When I discovered it, there were two eggs in the nest.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t bring myself to get rid of the eggs.&nbsp; I let the mother sit on the eggs.&nbsp; When the baby pigeons were born, the mother would bring them food.&nbsp; I placed two aluminum foil pans by the nest.&nbsp; One with water and one with bird seed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The baby pigeons grew and would move around the terrace behind the plant.&nbsp; If they moved too far away from the plant I would place them back in the nest.&nbsp; I let them stay but with my rules!&nbsp; LOL!!&nbsp; Eventually they flew away and I felt sad that they had left.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had the Bird Spikes for three years now and never did I see a pigeon on the terrace again since usually a pigeon will fly onto the railing first before it flies into the terrace.&nbsp; This year around March during storms I noticed one white pigeon resting atop one of my hanging basket at the back of the terrace.&nbsp; I felt bad because of the weather and left it alone.&nbsp; One day I noticed the white pigeon across the street perched on top of the Astoria bank with other pigeons.&nbsp; The other pigeons seemed to be ignoring him and flying away from him.&nbsp; I guess pigeons can be racists also !&nbsp; LOL!.&nbsp; The white pigeon continued to come to my terrace and I left him alone.&nbsp; I knew it was a male because I would see him going to another pigeon and fluffing up his feathers to impress the female, but the females would fly away from him.&nbsp; Then one day I realized that he hadn&#039;t come to the terrace and saw him one day with another pigeon gathering twigs for a nest.&nbsp; I guess there is always a pigeon that will fall for the outcast.&nbsp; I still see him around and I&#039;m hoping he won&#039;t be one of the victims to the Seagulls.&nbsp; The Seagulls when hungry will attack the pigeons and kill them for food.&nbsp; I have witnessed this numerous times on the Astoria Bank&#039;s rooftop.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a pretty site.

				White pigeons. I had a strange encounter with one of the more colorful characters in the neighborhood. She told me that the white pigeons are bred especially for Santareia sacrifices. And every time you saw one, that meant there were devil worshippers around.<br /><br />I&#039;m only telling you what I heard. . . .<br /><br />PS it is no fun to have a pigeon nest under/beside your air conditioner!

				I had an ongoing war with the pigeons on my fire escape (just outside my bedroom) for about two years. And then I solved it.<br /><br />First off, I don&#039;t care that they were there. What I cared about was the incessant cooing -- and then the screaming of the baby birds once they hatched. It always sounded like children screaming to me, which was disturbing. And the cooing began waking me up in the morning.<br /><br />So I bought a super soaker. But they&#039;re not idiots -- the pigeons learned to fly away when I opened my window and always came back later -- and I accidentally even sprayed someone passing by on the sidewalk once, so after going though two of them I decided to think of something else. <br /><br />I went out and tossed away two non-egged nests. They still came back and built more, faster.<br /><br />And then I remembered something my mom did. She hates birds of all kinds and didn&#039;t want even sparrows making a nest in the bird house she hung outside (as decoration only!) So she hung up a sock with mothballs in it, and that worked. Why it took me so long to think of this myself I have no idea. But I went out with two socks filled with stinky mothballs, tied them together looped under one of the grates on the fire escape, and have not had a pigeon problem since.<br /><br />They have moved one fire escape down, but I can&#039;t hear them now at least. <br /><br />So there you go: Mothballs + socks = no pigeons.<br />

				After hearing about her for a long time, another resident and I who work in the gardens of our building on 75th finally saw the &quot;pigeon lady&quot; a few weeks ago throwing birdseed among the plants. We politely told her we respected her love of animals but would really appreciate it if she would stop throwing bread and seeds into our gardens. She said she never spread anything other than birdseed. We pointed out that uneaten seeds mean more weeding for us. She said she&#039;d stop, and I think she has (in our gardens). <br /><br />We&#039;ve also got residents who daily put out food and water for stray cats, which I would think would attract vermin. But rational discussion of the issue doesn&#039;t deter them.

				Buddy--I think taking hungry or otherwise needy strays under your wing (speaking of animals) as you describe--in your apartment--is entirely admirable. My concern is with putting food outside willy-nilly, potentially creating more problems with rodents. <br /><br />I&#039;m also curious now if the neighborhood seeder is just one person. I&#039;ve been told by others that she&#039;s regularly seen throughout the neighborhood. A passerby who lives in her building and knows her slightly told us she puts out 30-40 lbs of birdseed a day! That sounds a bit hard to believe, but you never know. The cart she pushes would handle it, and it might also explain why she was wearing a support belt for her back--like weightlifters use.

				Until recently I thought there was just one &quot;pigeon lady&quot;, but last week I saw another woman with a shopping cart on 76th Street between Roosevelt and 37th Avenue scattering bird seed and bread crumbs, so we have at least 2 &quot;pigeon people&quot; and hopefully no more.
