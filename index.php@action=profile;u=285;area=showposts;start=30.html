					&nbsp;Agreed. This looks so sketchy and if anyone randomly attacked in our building they would have a probability of<br />getting next to nothing though we do have some affluent residents now. I walked by a house robbery in Woodside<br />about 5yrs ago and heard the officer ask why the man happened to have $7,000. in cash on hand? He said it was<br />from his business and when the officer said that&#039;s what the night deposits are for he shrugged. Someone knew.

					&nbsp;We did take out an old dishwasher and put in this washer/dryer combo which is very popular in European countries. The<br />point about using them for kids clothes is true as they don&#039;t really dry but sortof steam dry the clothes. Mostly you have<br />to put things on a drying rack to go the last bit to fully dry. Not good at all with towels and larger sheets but very handy<br />for people that might do a small load a day or every other. Gym clothes and lingerie are fine but most of us where more<br />than that! They only use 5 gallons of way BTW which may be less than many dishwashers.<br />

					&nbsp;Thanks for the heads up here. We should as a community get organized on this one. Otherwise we will have a ring of <br />super high rises surrounding the neighborhood. We have no natural breathing area like a coastline to lessen the impact. <br />Schools are very crowded in most areas already along with a number of other services.<br />&nbsp;Here&#039;s one spot to watch out for - the White Castle offices on 34th Ave and 69th/70th sts look like they are closed.<br />A contractor would have a full block of 34th ave to work with and most likely see little opposition as most people crap up <br />this area with excess trash anyway (even though JHBG had made huge progress cleaning the street up). The bowling <br />alley and pool hall are nicely run establishments though and the kidney dialysis and Regal Heights centers make for all<br />day presence in the neighborhood. BUT having this type of land available is exactly the precedent we should be concerned about.

					jh_coop_buyer, sounds like you have very young children and I hope you are enjoying their pre-school years. But trust me<br />that the problems you may or may not encounter once you enter the school system can challenge even the best prepared<br />parents. It sounds like you are planning ahead with funds but keep an open mind as to the needs of individual children<br />and have the local schools, like Garden School or St. Joans, in your research. <br />&nbsp;Lets imagine a child&#039;s unique situation and the need to change it where the public school system is not always willing <br />or well equipped to do so. A tuition bill might pale under these circumstances if your child was in need.<br />&nbsp; FYI- a lot of schools have limited after school and this is a major headache for alot of parents who may not like their <br />mid-age student leaving alone at 3:00 and your work may not permit mid-day pickups. These are some of the vast reasons <br />why you might prefer a local school with alot of activities and supervision. Early parenting advice that I took seriously was to just keep your options very, very open.

					&nbsp;Here&#039;s another view of things from someone farther down the parenting road. Eventually, you realize that formal academics <br />are only a part of the transition into an independent life for your children. It&#039;s been a stunning realization to see many <br />families knock themselves out early on bringing their children to non-local schools believing them to be far superior to our <br />local choices only to see that the children often end up in very similar situations regarding academic placement (college) <br />in the end. And then you add another five years and the playing field has surprisingly almost leveled out in terms of who <br />the kids have become as adults. None of us have the power to forecast the future but we are happy to have followed our <br />instincts on neighborhood schooling. If you do go non-local, the early years tend to be the easiest but come 4th grade and <br />definitely in middle school, parents will reap big benefits in their connection to their child&#039;s life, their friend set and who <br />they are as individuals if you can physically be near their school. Ride the trains between 3-4pm on a school day and see <br />if that commute of slightly older kids looks comfortable or distressing to you. It can be a real eye opener.<br />&nbsp; Schools like Garden School, Renaissance, St. Joans are small schools alternatives in JH but there are other fine schools here<br />that would benefit from more local involvement. Parents without family care who need 8am to 6pm coverage care may find <br />that the numbers work at a place like Garden when they factor in great after school, sports, tutoring, etc. vs. paying a reliable<br />caregiver a good wage and benefits for pick ups and activities. Our academic standards are very high BUT they factor in<br />the whole child/family at the same time.<br />&nbsp; The main thing is giving JH families smart workable local choices.

					&nbsp;I second this. Garden School is a hidden gem in JH for alot of families. Let your kid be a local kid, not a long commuting, test<br />taking machine and everyone will be happier long term. Independence and individualism are valued there.

					&nbsp;Understood, Lilybell, that whether this is outlet merchandise or a different product in disguise is the core of this discussion. Point<br />taken.

					&nbsp;Have a hard time believing that someone does not think this store is an asset for Jackson Heights. For real? Are you watching <br />what goods and service the other local stores are selling? IMHO this place is a godsend and the quality of the two items I<br />purchased is about a 4 out of 5. Most of us don&#039;t need/want fussy clothing for alot of our waking hours and this store provides<br />enough quality, fit and style to keep us satisfied.<br />&nbsp; My biggest complaint is how many people leave the stuff thrown all over the place!!Why can&#039;t you fold back the thing you <br />just looked at? Can&#039;t be that hard. After reading Barbara Ehrenreich&#039;s investigative writings about the way Walmart shoppers <br />leave piles of stuff to put back, I always return my stuff after the fitting rooms and really try to keep it folded so it&#039;s not the<br />pigsty of other stores like Old Navy on a weekend. At this Gap store, I watched a woman continue to pull a whole stack of sweatshirts down from a top shelf after staff explained there were none in that size/color available. Made a big mess and <br />walked. Not nice...

					&nbsp;So many people came out this year to see the Worlds Fair site. Now it&#039;s time to move the ball forward with the cleanup and<br />renovations so we can show Parks that it is important to us for so many reasons. Portions of tonight&#039;s Mets game ticket sales<br />will give be donated to the People for the Pavilion- a fantastic cause- and you get a nicely designed t-shirt with Mets colors <br />using the Pavilion image too!<br />&nbsp;If you find yourself looking for something to do tonight, head over to Citifield and give this benefit some much needed help! <br />More details below...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketing/group_offers.jsp?group=pavilion" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketing/group_offers.jsp?group=pavilion</a>

					Yes, it was JHBG(Jackson Heights Beautification Group) and Nuala O&#039;Doherty was in charge. Some businesses <br />are involved too with donations and are committed to keeping them green and clean, as I understand it. The <br />two proprietors that I heard about are Table Wine and that great locksmith on the same block. They look wonderful<br />and am hopeful we will see more like them especially on 37th avenue.

					&nbsp;Stop this behemoth! Have the developers walked the surrounding neighborhood for a scale check? Completely disproportionate to the area. It would be a travesty for this to get built at this size and scale.
