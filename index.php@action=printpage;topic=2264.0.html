				A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary.<br /><br />&nbsp;Every word out of the bird&#039;s&#039; mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.&nbsp; John tried and tried to change the bird&#039;s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to &#039;clean up&#039; the bird&#039;s vocabulary.<br /><br />&nbsp;Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The&nbsp; parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed.<br />&nbsp;Then suddenly there was total quiet.&nbsp; Not a peep was heard for over a minute.<br /><br />&nbsp;Fearing that he&#039;d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer.&nbsp; The parrot calmly stepped out onto John&#039;s outstretched arms and said &quot;I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions.&nbsp; I&#039;m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;John was stunned at the change in the bird&#039;s attitude.<br />As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, <br />the bird spoke-up, very softly, &quot;May I ask what the turkey did?&quot; :D

I&#039;m in the mood for a little dark meat. <br /><br />7. Are you ready for seconds yet? <br /><br />8. It&#039;s a little dry, do you still want to eat it? <br /><br />9. Just wait your turn, you&#039;ll get some! <br /><br />10. Don&#039;t play with your meat. <br /><br />11. Just spread the legs open and stuff it in. <br /><br />12.

You still have a little bit on your chin. <br /><br />15. How long will it take after you stick it in? <br /><br />16. You&#039;ll know it&#039;s ready when it pops up. <br /><br />17. Wow, I didn&#039;t think I could handle all of that! <br /><br />18. That&#039;s the biggest one I&#039;ve ever seen! <br /><br />19.

				First Time Sex <br /><br />A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet, and have dinner with her parents. <br /><br />Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br />The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />He tells the pharmacist it&#039;s his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. <br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he&#039;d like to buy,&nbsp; a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. <br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl&#039;s parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I&#039;m so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot; <br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl&#039;s parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. <br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. <br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot; <br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;And I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				OK, it&#039;s a little risque ...<br /><br />It is near the end of the school year. The teacher has turned in her grades. There is really nothing to do. All the kids are restless because there is nothing to do and it is near the end of the day. <br /><br />The teacher says, &quot;Whoever answers the questions I ask first and correctly can leave early today.&quot; Little Johnny says to himself, &quot;Good, I want to get outta here. I&#039;m smart and will answer the question&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The teacher asked, &quot;Who said &#039;Four Score and Seven Years Ago&#039;?&quot; Before Johnny could open his mouth, Susie said, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The teacher said, &quot;That&#039;s right Susie. You can go&quot;. Johnny was MAD. Susie answered first.<br /><br /><br />The teacher asked, &quot;Who said, &#039;I Have a Dream&#039;?&quot; Before Johnny could open his mouth, Mary said, &quot;Martin Luther King&quot;. The teacher said, &quot;That&#039;s right Mary. You can go&quot;. Johnny was even MADDER than before. Mary answered first.<br /><br /><br />The teacher asked, &quot;Who said &#039;Ask not, what your country can do for you&#039;?&quot; Before Johnny could open his mouth, Nancy said, &quot;John Kennedy&quot;. The teacher said, &quot;That&#039;s right Nancy. You can go&quot;.<br />Johnny was BOILING MAD. Nancy answered first.<br /><br /><br />Then the teacher turned her back, and Johnny said, &quot;I wish these b&lt;beeeeep&gt;s would keep their mouths shut&quot;.<br />The teacher asked, &quot;WHO SAID THAT?&quot; &nbsp;<br />Johnny said, &quot;TIGER WOODS! CAN I GO NOW?&quot;<br />

				A lawyer boarded an airplane in New Orleans with a box of frozen crab and asked a blonde stewardess to take care of them for him. <br /><br />She took the box and promised to put it in the crew&#039;s refrigerator. <br /><br />He advised her that he was holding her personally responsible for them staying frozen mentioning in a very haughty manner that he was a lawyer and proceeded to rant at her about what would happen if she let them thaw out. <br /><br />Needless to say she was annoyed by his behavior. <br /><br />Shortly before landing in New York she used the intercom to announce to the entire cabin â€œWould the gentleman who gave me the crabs in New Orleans please raise your hand?&quot; <br /><br />Not one hand went up...so she took them home and ate them. <br /><br />Two lessons here: <br /><br />1.

				The Senility Defense (sent to me by a nun no less)<br /><br />An Elderly couple was celebrating their sixtieth anniversary.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;The couple had married as childhood sweethearts and had&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;moved back to their old neighbourhood after they retired. <br /><br />Holding hands they walked back to their old school. <br />I t was not locked, so they entered, and found the old desk&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;they&#039;d shared where Andy had carved &#039;I love you, Sally.&#039; <br /><br />On their way back ho me , a bag of money fell out of&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;an armored car, practically landing at their feet. <br />Sally quickly picked it up, but not sure&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;what to do with it, they took it home.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;There, she counted the money:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />fifty-thousand dollars!&nbsp; <br /><br />Andy said, &#039;We&#039;ve got to give it back.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Sally said, &#039;Finders keepers.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;She put the money back in the bag and hid it in their attic. <br />The next day, two FBI men were canvassing the neighborhood&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;looking for the money and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&#039;Pardon me, but did either of you find a bag&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;that fell out of an armored car yesterday?&#039; <br />&nbsp; <br />Sally said, &#039;No.&#039;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Andy said, &#039;She&#039;s lying.

				<strong>This Joke has been around for a while but it is G-rated and it can be translated into any language and it would be relatively funny (i think)</strong><br /><br /><br /><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong><br />A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground. He doesn&#039;t seem to be breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head.<br /><br /><br /><br />The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: â€œMy friend is dead! What can I do?â€<br /><br /><br /><br />The operator, in a calm, soothing voice, says: â€œJust take it easy. I can help. First, letâ€™s make sure heâ€™s dead.â€<br /><br /><br /><br />There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guyâ€™s voice comes back on the line.

				@ Contessa..That was great...for one reason or another it reminded me of a situation with my friend Gerson. &nbsp;<em><strong>Not a joke but I guess You had to be there to appreciate the subtle humor</strong></em> - I have been traveling with him for probably close to 20 years, he had a PhD in History and a Masters in Urban planing....he is 20+ years my senior but at the time I used to do consulting for a firm he was a partner in and we hit it off. &nbsp;We had lots in common especially Johnnie Walker Black...hehehe &nbsp;:2funny: &nbsp;We were flying back from Mexico (I think it was Mexico). &nbsp;I made a comment to him - jokingly I said <em>&quot;Hey Gerson, remember years ago when we used to go to Central and South America?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;They always had these very young, beautiful and sexy attendants - Were are they...what happened? &nbsp;</em> <br />He turned around and grab one of the stewardesses (don&#039;t get me wrong, she was very nice looking but she was not 20 or 30 years old - she was probably in her late 40&#039;s or very early 50&#039;s) and said to her <em>&quot;Hello dear, may I asked how long you&#039;ve been working in the airline industry?&quot;</em> She was very well manner and simply said <em>&quot;Next month it will be my 19Th year&quot;. &nbsp;</em> He then waited for her to leave and turn around and told me <em>&quot;You see - They have the same stewardesses working Lou - They just got Old&quot; </em> - In a funny, crude way - he made lots of sense. ;D &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong><br />@ Really4rob - WTF? &nbsp;I found myself singing the Big red song &nbsp;:D- how long has it been since their ads have been absent from TV?</strong></em>

				WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD??? <br />DR. PHIL:<br /><br />The problem we have here is that this chicken won&#039;t realize that he must first deal with the problem on &#039;THIS&#039; side of the road before it goes after the problem on the &#039;OTHER SIDE&#039; of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he&#039;s acting by not taking on his &#039;CURRENT&#039; problems before adding &#039;NEW&#039; problems.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />OPRAH :<br /><br />Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I&#039;m going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />GEORGE W. BUSH:<br /><br />We don&#039;t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?COLIN POWELL:?<br /><br />?Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road...?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />?ANDERSON COOPER - CNN:? <br /><br /><br />?We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?JOHN KERRY:?<br /><br />?Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken&#039;s intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?NANCY GRACE:?<br /><br />?That chicken crossed the road because he&#039;s GUILTY! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?PAT BUCHANAN:?<br /><br />?To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?MARTHA STEWART:?<br /><br />?No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer&#039;s Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />?DR SEUSS:? <br /><br /><br />?Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I&#039;ve not been told.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?ERNEST HEMINGWAY:?<br /><br />?To die in the rain. Alone.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?JERRY FALWELL:?<br /><br />?Because the chicken was gay! Can&#039;t you people see the plain truth?&#039; That&#039;s why they call it the &#039;other side.&#039; Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media white washes with seemingly harmless phrases like &#039;the other side. That chicken should not be crossing the road. It&#039;s as plain and as simple as that.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />?GRANDPA:? <br /><br /><br />?In my day we didn&#039;t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?BARBARA WALTERS:?<br /><br />?Isn&#039;t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its life long dream of crossing the road.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />?JOHN LENNON:? <br /><br /><br />?Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />ARISTOTLE :?<br /><br />?It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?BILL GATES:?<br /><br />?I have just released eChicken2008, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your check book.

				In light of the political threads ...<br /><br />A little boy goes to his dad and asks, &quot;What is politics?&quot;<br /><br />Dad says, &quot;Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I&#039;m the breadwinner of the family, so let&#039;s call me capitalism. Your Mom, she&#039;s the administrator of the money, so we&#039;ll call her the Government. We&#039;re here to take care of your needs, so we&#039;ll call you the people. The nanny, we&#039;ll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we&#039;ll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense,&quot;<br /><br />So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said.<br /><br />Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents&#039; room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny&#039;s room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, &quot;Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.&quot;<br /><br />The father says, &quot;Good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.&quot;<br /><br />The little boy replies, &quot;Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in deep poo.&quot;<br />

				<span style="font-family: IMPACT;" class="bbc_font"></span><div align="center"><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Tips to improve your writing</strong></span></div><br /><strong>1. Avoid alliteration. Always.<br /><br />2. Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.<br /><br />3. Employ the vernacular.<br /><br />4. Eschew ampersands &amp; abbreviations, etc. <br /><br />5. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.<br /><br />6. Remember to never split an infinitive.<br /><br />7. Contractions aren&#039;t necessary.<br /><br />8. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br /><br />9. One should never generalize.<br /><br />10. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, &quot;I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br /><br />11. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br /><br />12. Don&#039;t be redundant; don&#039;t use more words than necessary; it&#039;s highly superfluous.<br /><br />13. Be more or less specific.<br /><br />14. Understatement is always best.<br /><br />15. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br /><br />16. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.<br /><br />17. The passive voice is to be avoided.<br /><br />18. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br /><br />19. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br /><br />20. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br /><br />21. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br /><br />22. Don&#039;t never use a double negation.<br /><br />23. capitalize every sentence and remember always end it with point<br /><br />24. Do not put statements in the negative form.<br /><br />25. Verbs have to agree with their subjects.<br /><br />26. Proofread carefully to see if you words out.<br /><br />27. If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.<br /><br />28. A writer must not shift your point of view.<br /><br />29. And don&#039;t start a sentence with a conjunction. (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.)<br /><br />30. Don&#039;t overuse exclamation marks!!<br /><br />31. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more words, to the irantecedents.<br /><br />32. Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.<br /><br />33. If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.<br /><br />34. Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing metaphors.<br /><br />35. Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.<br /><br />36. Everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.<br /><br />37. Always pick on the correct idiom.<br /><br />38. The adverb always follows the verb.<br /><br />39. Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; They&#039;re old hat; seek viable alternatives.</strong>

				<em>OK, I&#039;ll avoid the political humor for the next few ...</em><br /><br />A commercial airplane is in flight to Chicago, when a blonde woman sitting in economy gets up and moves to an open seat in the first class section. A flight attendant watches her do this, and politely informs the woman that she must return to her seat in the economy class because that&#039;s the type of ticket she paid for.<br /><br />The blonde woman replies, &quot;I&#039;m blonde, I&#039;m beautiful, I&#039;m going to&nbsp; Chicago and I&#039;m staying right here.&quot;<br /><br />After repeated attempts and no success convicing the woman to return to economy, the flight attendant goes into the cockpit and informs the pilot and co-pilot that there&#039;s a blonde bimbo sitting in first class who refuses to go back to her proper seat.<br /><br />The co-pilot goes back to the woman and explains why she needs to move, but once again the woman replies by saying, &quot;I&#039;m blonde, I&#039;m beautiful, I&#039;m going to&nbsp; Chicago and I&#039;m staying right here.&quot;<br /><br />The co-pilot returns to the cockpit and suggests that perhaps they should have the arrival gate call the police and have the woman arrested when they land. The pilot says, &quot;You say she&#039;s blonde? I&#039;ll handle this. I&#039;m married to a blonde. I speak blonde.&quot; He kneels down next to the woman and whispers quietly in her ear, and she says, &quot;Oh, I&#039;m sorry,&quot; then quickly moves back to her seat in economy class.<br /><br />The flight attendant and co-pilot are amazed and ask him what he said to get her to move back to economy without causing any fuss.<br /><br />&quot;I told her first class isn&#039;t going to Chicago.&quot;<br />

				A blonde, a brunette and a red head were smoking cigarettes one afternoon. The blonde had Camels, red head had Marlboros, and the brunette had Kools.<br /><br />It began to pour down raining, so the red head and brunette both pull out a condom and put it on their cigs. The blonde says &quot;what are you doing?&quot; - and they say &quot;we&#039;re saving it for later!&quot;<br /><br />Impressed, and in a hurry, the blonde goes to the nearest store and asks for a condom.

				&nbsp; A U.S. Marine squad was marching north of Fallujah when they came upon an Iraqi terrorist, badly injured and unconscious. On the opposite side of the road was an American Marine in a similar but less serious state. The Marine was conscious and alert and as first aid was given to both men, the squad leader asked the injured Marine what had happened. The Marine reported, &quot;I was heavily armed and moving north along the highway here, and coming south was a heavily armed insurgent. We saw each other and both took cover in the ditches along the road. I yelled to him that Saddam Hussein was a miserable, lowlife scum bag who got what he deserved, and he yelled back that Ted Kennedy is a fat, good-for-nothing, left wing liberal drunk who doesn&#039;t know how to drive, and Obama is an idiot.So I said that Osama Bin Laden dresses and acts like a frigid, mean-spirited lesbian. He retaliated by yelling, &quot;Oh yeah? Well, so does Nancy Pelosi!&quot; &quot;And, there we were, in the middle of the road, shaking hands, when a truck hit us.&quot;&nbsp; <br />

I had an emergency at the hospital with a patient, you know how it is, and I didn&#039;t have time to get you a gift.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not to worry,&quot; said the father. &quot;The important thing is that we&#039;re all together today.&quot;<br /><br />Son number two arrived and announced, &quot;You and Mom look great, Dad.

I&#039;m sorry, but my boss is sending me out of town and I was really busy packing, so I didn&#039;t have time to get you anything.&quot;<br /><br />After they had finished dessert, the father said, &quot;There&#039;s something your mother and I have wanted to tell you for a long time. You see, we were very poor when we got together. Despite this, we were able to send each of you to college. Throughout the years your mother and I knew that we loved each other very much, but we just never found the time to get married.&quot;<br /><br />The three children gasped and all said, &quot;You mean we&#039;re bastards?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yep,&quot; said the father. &quot;And cheap ones too.&quot;

Easter is a<br />Christian holiday which coincides with the Jewish Passover. After Jesus<br />celebrated Passover with His disciples, He was betrayed by Judas and<br />turned over to the Romans. They crucified Him on a cross. After He died,<br />they buried him in a tomb and put a huge boulder in front of it.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Very good!&quot; said St. Peter.<br /><br />The blonde continued. &quot;Now, every year, the Jews roll the stone away and<br />Jesus comes out.

				3 Wishes <br /><br />A couple was golfing one day on a very, very exclusive golf course, lined with million dollar houses. On the third tee the husband said, &quot;Honey, be very careful when you drive the ball dont knock out any windows. Itll cost us a fortune to fix.&quot; <br /><br />The wife teed up and shanked it right through the window of the biggest house on the course. The husband cringed and said, &quot;I told you to watch out for the houses. Alright, lets go up there, apologize and see how much this is going to cost.&quot; <br /><br />They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, &quot;Come on in.&quot; They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and a broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer. A man on the couch said, &quot;Are you the people that broke my window?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Uh, yeah, sorry about that.&quot; the husband replied.<br />1 year ago<br /><br />&quot;No, actually I want to thank you. Im a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. Youve released me. Im allowed to grant three wishes- Ill give you each one wish, and Ill keep the last one for myself.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;OK, great!&quot; the husband said. â€œI want a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.&quot; &quot;No problem-its the least I could do. And you, what do you want?&quot; the genie said, looking at the wife. <br /><br />&quot;I want a house in every country of the world,&quot; she said. <br /><br />&quot;Consider it done.&quot; the genie replied. <br /><br />&quot;And whats your wish, genie?â€ the husband said.<br />1 year ago<br /><br />&quot;Well, since Ive been trapped in that bottle, I havent had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife.&quot; <br /><br />The husband looks at the wife and said, &quot;Well, we did get a lot of money and all those houses, honey. I guess I dont care.&quot; The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours. <br /><br />After it was over, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife, and said, &quot;How old is your husband, anyway?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;35.&quot; she replied. <br /><br />&quot;And he still believes in genies?

				In honor of the skateboard thread I just read:<br /><br />There were three guys waiting to get into heaven, they were at<br />the pearly gates and Saint Peter told them that to get into<br />heaven, they had to answer one question, which was, &quot; Have you<br />been faithful to your wife?&quot;. The first man told him, that yes,<br />he had been faithful and had never even thought about fooling<br />around. Saint Peter, gave the man a cadillac and let him in the<br />pearly gates. The second guy said, that yes he had been<br />faithful, but he did think about fooling around a couple of<br />times, Saint Peter gave him a bicycle and let him in the pearly<br />gates. The third guy stepped up, and hanging his head down, said<br />that he was unfaithful every chance he got, and was deeply sorry<br />for it. Saint Peter gave him a skateboard and let him in the<br />pearly gates.<br />Then one day, the guy on the skateboard, saw the guy in the<br />cadillac pulled over by a cloud and just crying his eyes out.<br />The skateboarder asked him why he was crying, he got the<br />cadillac and he shouldn&#039;t have anything to cry about. The guy in<br />the cadillac looked up and said, &quot; I just saw my wife skateboard<br />by&quot;!;)

You look really, really good in yellow. <br /><br />8. You just went on a low cholesterol diet and didn&#039;t want to waste all those eggs in the fridge. <br /><br />7. You figure any Holiday that starts with a &quot;Good Friday&quot; can&#039;t be all bad. <br /><br />6. You love to bite the heads off chocolate bunnies. <br /><br />5. It&#039;s a good time to check out your neighborhood church and not be noticed. <br /><br />4. You have this bunny suit you love to wear, but are too insecure to wear it without a reason. <br /><br />3. Even though you don&#039;t know what it is, you really like the sound of going to a &quot;Passion Play.&quot; <br /><br />2. You figured since Jesus went to all THAT trouble to make it to the first Easter, you&#039;d give it a shot. <br /><br />1. As a Christian you celebrate the resurrection every other day, why not Easter too?</em>

				Universal Truths ...<br /><br />(some are enh, some are funny ...)<br /><br />1. I think part of a best friend&#039;s job should be to immediately clear your computer history if you die.<br />2. Nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you realize you&#039;re wrong.<br />&nbsp;3. I totally take back all those times I didn&#039;t want to nap when I was younger.<br />&nbsp;4. There is great need for a sarcasm font.<br />&nbsp;5. How the hell are you supposed to fold a fitted sheet?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;6. Was learning cursive really necessary?<br />&nbsp;7. Map Quest really needs to start their directions on #5. I&#039;m pretty sure I know how to get out of&nbsp; &nbsp;my neighborhood.<br />8. Obituaries would be a lot more interesting if they told you how the person died. <br />9. I can&#039;t remember the last time I wasn&#039;t at least kind of tired.<br />&nbsp;10. Bad decisions make good stories.<br />11. You never know when it will strike, but there comes a moment at work when you know that you just aren&#039;t going to do anything productive for the rest of the day. <br />12. Can we all just agree to ignore whatever comes after Blue Ray? I don&#039;t want to have to restart my collection...again. <br />&nbsp;13. I&#039;m always slightly terrified when I exit out of Word and it asks me if I want to save any changes to my ten-page research paper that I swear I did not make any changes to.<br />14. &quot;Do not machine wash or tumble dry&quot; means I will never wash this - ever. <br />&nbsp;15. I hate when I just miss a call by the last ring (Hello? Hello?), but when I immediately call back, it rings nine times and goes to voicemail. What did you do after I didn&#039;t answer? Drop the phone and run away? <br />&nbsp;16. I hate leaving my house confident and looking good and then not seeing anyone of importance the entire day. What a waste.<br />&nbsp;17. I keep some people&#039;s phone numbers in my phone just so I know not to answer when they call. <br />&nbsp;18. I think the freezer deserves a light as well.<br />&nbsp;19. I disagree with Kay Jewelers. I would bet on any given Friday or Saturday night more kisses begin with Miller Lite than Kay.<br />&nbsp;20. I wish Google Maps had an &quot;Avoid Ghetto&quot; routing option.<br />&nbsp;21. Sometimes, I&#039;ll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the heck was going on when I first saw it. <br />&nbsp;22. I would rather try to carry 10 plastic grocery bags in each hand than take 2 trips to bring my groceries in.<br />&nbsp;23. The only time I look forward to a red light is when I&#039;m trying to finish a text. <br />&nbsp;24. I have a hard time deciphering the fine line between boredom and hunger. <br />&nbsp;25. How many times is it appropriate to say &quot;What?&quot; before you just nod and smile because you still didn&#039;t hear or understand a word they said?<br />&nbsp;26. I love the sense of camaraderie when an entire line of cars team up to prevent an ass from cutting in at the front. Stay strong, brothers and sisters! <br />&nbsp;27. Shirts get dirty. Underwear gets dirty. Pants? Pants never get dirty, and you can wear them forever. <br />&nbsp;28. Is it just me or do high school kids get dumber &amp; dumber every year?<br />&nbsp;29. There&#039;s no worse feeling than that millisecond you&#039;re sure you are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too far. <br />&nbsp;30. As a driver I hate pedestrians, and as a pedestrian I hate drivers, but no matter what the mode of transportation, I always hate cyclists.<br />&nbsp;31. Sometimes I&#039;ll look down at my watch 3 consecutive times and still not know what time it is.<br />&nbsp;32. Even under ideal conditions people have trouble locating their car keys in a pocket, finding their cell phone, and Pinning the Tail on the Donkey - but I&#039;d bet my behind everyone can find and push the snooze button from 3 feet away, in about 1.7 seconds, eyes closed, first time, every time!

				P.f.izer Announcement<br /><br />P.f. izer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of &#039;cocktails&#039;, &#039;highballs&#039; and just a good old-fashioned &#039;stiff drink&#039;. Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.<br /><br />Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants and viagra today than on Alzheimer&#039;s research. This means that by 2040, there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.<br />&nbsp;:2funny: :2funny: :2funny: :2funny: ;D ;D

				SENIOR DRESS CODE <br />Many of us &#039;Old Folks&#039; (over 50) are quite confused today about how we should present ourselves. Feeling &#039;young&#039;, we try to conform to current fashions and present a youthful image. <br /><br /><br />Contrary to what you may have seen on the streets, the following combinations DO NOT go together and should be avoided: <br /><br />&nbsp;1. A nose ring and bifocals <br /><br />2. Spiked hair and bald spots <br /><br />3. A pierced tongue and dentures <br /><br />4. Miniskirts and support hose <br /><br />5. Ankle bracelets and corn pads <br /><br />6. Speedo&#039;s and cellulite <br /><br />7. A belly button ring and a gall bladder surgery scar <br /><br />8. Unbuttoned disco shirts and a heart monitor <br /><br />9. Midriff shirts and a midriff bulge <br /><br />10. Bikinis and liver spots <br /><br />11. Mini skirts and varicose veins <br /><br />And, Most importantly <br /><br />At some point you have to give up the &#039;DAISY DUKE&#039; shorts <br /><br />

				<br /><br />Three mischievous old Grannies were sitting on a bench outside a nursing home&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />When an old Grandpa walked by ......<br /><br />One of the old Grandmas yelled out saying, &quot;We bet we can tell exactly how old you are.&quot; <br /><br />The old man said, &quot;There is no way you can guess it, you old fools.&quot; <br />One of the old Grandmas said, &quot;Sure we can! <br />Just drop your pants and under shorts and we can tell your exact age.&quot; <br /><br />Embarrassed just a little, but anxious to prove they couldn&#039;t do it, he dropped his drawers. <br /><br />The Grandmas asked him to first turn around a couple of times and to jump up and down several times. Then they all piped up and said, <br />&quot;You&#039;re 87 years old!&quot; <br /><br />Standing with his pants down around his ankles, the old gent asked, &quot;How in the world did you guess?&quot; <br /><br />Slapping their knees and grinning from ear to ear, the three old ladies happily yelled in unison... <br /><br />&quot;We were at your birthday party yesterday !!!&quot;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Dave works hard at the plant and spends two nights each week bowling and plays golf every Saturday. His wife thinks he&#039;s pushing himself too hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club.<br />The doorman at the club greets them and says, &quot;Hey, Dave! How ya doin?&quot; His wife is puzzled and asks if he&#039;s been to this club before. &quot;Oh no,&quot; says Dave. &quot;He&#039;s on my bowling team.&quot;<br /><br />When they are seated, a waitress asks Dave if he&#039;d like his usual and brings over a Budweiser. His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says, &quot;How did she know that you drink Budweiser?&quot; &quot;I recognize her, she&#039;s the waitress from the golf club. I always have a bud at the end of the first nine, honey.<br /><br />A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Dave, starts to rub herself all over him and says, &quot;Hi ! Davey. Want your usual table dance, big boy?&quot; Dave&#039;s wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club. Dave follows and spots her getting into a cab.<br /><br />Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her. Dave tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it. She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every 4 letter word in the book.<br /><br />The cabby turns around and says, &quot;Geez Dave, you picked up a real ***** this time.&quot;

The Blonde team rides on the top level. <br /><br />The Brunette team down below is whooping it up having a great time, when one of them realises she doesn&#039;t hear anything from the Blondes upstairs.<br /><br />She decides to go up and investigate. When the Brunette reaches the top, she finds all the Blondes frozen in fear, staring straight-ahead at the road, and clutching the seats in front of them with white knuckles.<br /><br />She says, &quot;What the heck&#039;s goin&#039; on up here?

				For the holidays ...<br /><br />It was Rosh Hashanah evening. In the neighborhood, everyone was heading to services. And on his way to synagogue, the Rabbi notices one of his neighbors - an old timer - sitting on a park bench. <br />&quot;Sam. Aren&#039;t you going to services.&quot;? <br />&quot;Not this year, Rabbi.&quot; <br />&quot;Why not Sam? Don&#039;t you think you should ask G-d for another year of good health?&quot; <br />&quot;Rabbi. I&#039;m ninety-three years old. Most of my friends are gone. And I have a hunch. I think that in heaven they&#039;ve forgotten about me. And the last thing I want to do... is remind them!&quot;

				And one more, since we get two days off ...<br /><br />The rabbi was fed up with his congregation. So, he decided to skip the services on Rosh Hashanah and instead go play golf. <br />Moses was looking down from heaven and saw the rabbi on the golf course. <br />He naturally reported it to God. Moses suggested God punish the rabbi severely. <br />As he watched, Moses saw the rabbi playing the best game he had ever played! The rabbi got a hole-in-one on the toughest hole on the course. <br />Moses turned to God and asked, &quot;I thought you were going to punish him. <br />Do you call this punishment?!&quot; <br />God replied, &quot;Who can he tell?&quot;

				For the school bus drivers (who take hours to drive 20 blocks) ...<br /><br />There was this guy who just got a new job as a school bus driver for elementary school children.<br /><br />He thought it would be nice to paint the school bus with characters from Sesame Street. So, he painted Bert and Ernie, Big Bird, The Cookie Monster and so forth.<br /><br />At his first stop, there was this very overweight little girl. He opened the door and said, &quot;Hi, I&#039;m the new bus driver. What&#039;s your name?&quot;<br /><br />The girl said that her name was Pattie.<br /><br />Waiting at the next stop was another overweight little girl. He said, &quot;Hi, I&#039;m the new bus driver. What&#039;s your name?&quot;<br /><br />She said that her name was Pattie also.<br /><br />At the next stop, there was a grown woman and a little boy. The bus driver said, &quot;Hi, I&#039;m the new bus driver. What&#039;s your name?&quot;<br /><br />The woman piped up and said, &quot;His name is Ross and he is my son.&quot; She continued, &quot;He is very, very special, so I want you to take extra good care of him.&quot; The bus driver replied,<br /><br />&quot;No problem. He can have this seat right behind me and I can watch him in the mirror.&quot;<br /><br />At the next stop, there was this little country boy standing there. The little boy was wearing tattered overalls and had no shoes or socks on his feet. The poor little boy had problems walking because of bunions all over his feet. The bus driver said, &quot;Hi, I&#039;m the new bus driver. What&#039;s your name?&quot;<br /><br />The little boy replied, &quot;My name is Lester Cleese.&quot; Well, little Lester picked at his bunions all the way to the school house, nearly driving the driver crazy.<br /><br />At home later that night, his wife asked him how his first day on the new job was. The man replied, &quot;Well, I had Two Obese Patties, with Special Ross, and Lester Cleese Picking Bunions On A Sesame Street Bus.&quot;

				A Big Mistake <br />&nbsp;In an ancient monastery, a new monk arrived to dedicate his life and to join the others copying ancient records. The first thing he noticed was that they were copying by hand, books that had already been copied by hand.<br /><br />He had to speak up. &quot;Forgive me, Father Justinian, but copying other copies by hand allows many chances for error. How do we know we aren&#039;t copying someone else&#039;s mistakes? Are they ever checked against the originals?&quot;<br /><br />Father Justinian was startled! No one had ever suggested that before. &quot;Well, that is a good point, my son. I will take one of these latest books down to the vault and study it against its original document.&quot;<br /><br />He went deep into the vault where no one else was allowed to enter, and started to study. The day passed, and it was getting late in the evening.<br /><br />The monks were getting worried about Father Justinian. Finally one monk started making his way through the old vault, and as he began to think he might get lost, he heard sobbing. &quot;Father Justinian?&quot; He called.<br /><br />The sobbing was louder as he came near. He finally found the old priest sitting at a table with both the new copy and the original ancient book in front of him. It was obvious that Father Justinian had been crying for a long time.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, my Lord,&quot; sobbed Father Justinian, &quot;the word is &#039;celebrate&#039;!!&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />

I just finished cleaning.&quot;<br /><br />2. My mother taught me RELIGION. <br />&quot;You better pray that will come out of the carpet.&quot;<br /><br />3. My mother taught me about TIME TRAVEL. <br />&quot;If you don&#039;t straighten up, I&#039;m going to knock you into the middle of next week!&quot;<br /><br />4. My mother taught me LOGIC. <br />&quot;Because I said so, that&#039;s why.&quot;<br /><br />5. My mother taught me FORESIGHT. <br />&quot;Make sure you wear clean underwear, in case you&#039;re in an accident.&quot;<br /><br />6. My mother taught me IRONY. <br />&quot;Keep crying, and I&#039;ll give you something to cry about.&quot;<br /><br />7. My mother taught me about the science of OSMOSIS. <br />&quot;Shut your mouth and eat your supper.&quot;<br /><br />8. My mother taught me about CONTORTIONISM. <br />&quot;Will you look at that dirt on the back of your neck!&quot;<br /><br />9. My mother taught me about STAMINA. <br />&quot;You&#039;ll sit there until all that spinach is gone.&quot;<br /><br />10.

My mother taught me the CIRCLE OF LIFE. <br />&quot;I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.&quot;<br /><br />13. My mother taught me about BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION. <br />&quot;Stop acting like your father!&quot;<br /><br />14. My mother taught me about ENVY. <br />&quot;There are millions of less fortunate children in this world who don&#039;t have wonderful parents like you do.&quot;<br /><br />19.

				And number 3&nbsp; &nbsp;(Madalyn you have to like at least 1 now ...)<br /><br />Is There Baseball In Heaven? <br />Two old men had been best friends for years, and they both live to their early 90&#039;s, when one of them suddenly falls deathly ill. His friend comes to visit him on his deathbed, and they&#039;re reminiscing about their long friendship, when the dying man&#039;s friend asks, &quot;Listen, when you die, do me a favor. I want to know if there&#039;s baseball in heaven.&quot; <br /><br />The dying man said, &quot;We&#039;ve been friends for years, this I&#039;ll do for you.&quot; And then he dies. <br /><br />A couple days later, his surviving friend is sleeping when he hears his friend&#039;s voice. The voice says, &quot;I&#039;ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there&#039;s baseball in heaven.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;What&#039;s the bad news?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You&#039;re pitching on Wednesday.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />

				Today&#039;s batch are in honor of the guy who had his car parked on the playstreet all morning, then we he got it, was asked to at least close the gate behind him and didn&#039;t.&nbsp; (Considering he avoided being towed, the very least he could do was be safe, right?)&nbsp; Anyway, best to vent with humor:<br /><br />Sam went to court and received a fine for parking his car in a &quot;No Parking&quot; zone.<br /><br />&quot;Do you have anything to say?&quot; asked the Judge.<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;They shouldn&#039;t put up such misleading notices.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the Judge asked.<br /><br />&quot;The sign said, &quot;Fine for Parking Here.&quot;<br />

				No-Parking Zone<br /><br />A minister parked his car in a no-parking zone in a large city because he was short of time and couldn&#039;t find a space with a meter. So he put a note under the windshield wiper that read: &quot;I have circled the block 10 times. If I don&#039;t park here, I&#039;ll miss my appointment. FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSES.&quot;<br />When he returned, he found a citation from a police officer along with this note: &quot;I&#039;ve circled this block for 10 years. If I don&#039;t give you a ticket, I&#039;ll lose my job. LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.&quot;<br />

				A mom and dad were worried about their son not wanting to learn math at the school he was in, so they decided to send him to a Catholic school. After the first day of school, their son comes racing into the house, goes straight into his room and slams the door shut. Mom and dad are a little worried about this and go to his room to see if he is okay. They find him sitting at his desk doing his homework. The boy keeps doing that for the rest of the year. At the end of the year the son brings home his report card and gives it to his mom and dad. Looking at it they see under math an A+.<br />Mom and dad are very happy and ask the son, &quot;What changed your mind about learning math?&quot;<br /><br />The son looked at mom and dad and said, &quot;Well, on the first day when I walked into the classroom, I saw a guy nailed to the plus sign at the back of the room behind the teacher&#039;s desk and I knew they meant business.&quot;<br /><br />

				A Lawyer and the Pope died at the same time, and showed up at the pearly gates together. St Peter says to both of them, &quot;Glad to see you. Come on in and see where your heavenly home is.&quot; So they go inside and walk along the golden path to an area where there are glorious palaces on both sides of the street. St, Peter points to the most beautiful of them and says to the Lawyer, &quot;Here&#039;s your place. Have a nice eternity,&quot; and he and the Pope continue to walk along the road. <br /><br />After a couple of miles the gold road turns to cement, and the palaces turn to 4 bedroom estates, and they keep walking. A mile more, and the road turns into black top, and the houses become bungalows. A mile more, and the road turns to dirt, and the houses to hovels. <br /><br />St. Peter stops in front of the meanest, dirtiest hovel and says to the Pope, &quot;Here&#039;s your heavenly home.&quot; <br /><br />The Pope goes understandably upset, saying, &quot;What do you mean? You gave that other guy a palace, and me you stick with a shack?&quot; <br /><br />St. Peter says, &quot;Obviously you don&#039;t understand. We&#039;ve got lots of Popes. That&#039;s the first Lawyer we&#039;ve had.&quot;<br />

				Oh Lordy!<br />A minister dies and, resplendent in his clerical collar and colorful robes, waits in line at the Pearly Gates. Just ahead of him is a guy dressed in sunglasses, a loud shirt, leather jacket, and jeans. <br /><br />Saint Peter addresses this guy, &quot;Who are you, so that I may know whether or not to admit you to the Kingdom of Heaven?&quot; <br /><br />The guy replies, &quot;I&#039;m Joe Green, taxi-driver, of Noo Yawk City.&quot; <br /><br />Saint Peter consults his list, smiles and says to the taxi-driver, &quot;Take this silken robe and golden staff, and enter into the Kingdom.&quot; <br /><br />So the taxi-driver enters Heaven with his robe and staff, and the minister is next in line. Without being asked, he proclaims, &quot;I am Michael O&#039;Connor, head pastor of Saint Mary&#039;s for the last forty-three years.&quot; <br /><br />Saint Peter consults his list and says, &quot;Take this cotton robe and wooden staff and enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Just a minute,&quot; says the preacher, &quot;that man was a taxi-driver, and you issued him a silken robe and golden staff. But I get wood and cotton. How can this be?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Up here, we go by results,&quot; says Saint Peter. &quot;While you preached, people slept -- while he drove, people prayed.&quot;<br />

				OK, I&#039;m going for the prize for corniest joke posted here - ready ?:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Two brooms were hanging in the closet and after a while they got to know each other so well, they decided to get married. <br /><br />One broom was, of course, the bride broom, the other the groom broom. <br /><br />The bride broom looked very beautiful in her white dress. The groom broom was handsome and suave in his tuxedo. The wedding was lovely. <br /><br />After the wedding, at the wedding dinner, the bride-broom leaned over and said to the groom-broom, &#039;I think I am going to have a little whisk broom!&#039; <br /><br />&#039;IMPOSSIBLE !&#039; said the groom broom. <br /><br />Are you ready for this? <br />Brace yourself; this is going to hurt! !! !! ! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#039;WE HAVEN&#039;T EVEN SWEPT TOGETHER!&#039; <br /><br />............ ............ ..............<br />Oh for goodness sake... Laugh, or at least groan.<br />Life&#039;s too short not to enjoy... Even these silly<br />....little cute.............

				Cute!<br /><br />On Brooms:<br /><br />A young man was hired by a supermarket and reported for his first day of work. The manager greeted him with a warm handshake and a smile, then gave him a broom and said,<br /><br />&quot;Son, your first job will be to sweep out the store.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But I&#039;m a college graduate,&quot; the young man replied indignantly.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sorry. I didn&#039;t realize that,&quot; said the manager. &quot;Here, give me the broom -- I&#039;ll show you how.&quot;

				Bob was joining the army and they were handing out rifles when he arrived, so he got in line. When it got to Bob, they had run out of guns. The man issuing rifles gave him a broom <br />&#039;&#039;This is a magic broom -- point it at anybody, say &#039;Bangity bangity bang,&#039; and they will die.&#039;&#039; Bob was really worried because he didn&#039;t think it would work, but he got in line for bayonets, thinking he might stand a chance if he could stab them to death. As luck would have it, Bob&#039;s turn came and they had ran out. <br />&#039;&#039;Don&#039;t worry.&#039;&#039; said the man issuing them out. &#039;&#039;I will give you this magic carrot -- point it at somebody, say &#039;Stabbity stabbity stab,&#039; and they will die.&quot; Now Bob is terrified, going into battle with a broom and carrot, when the sirens go off, signaling invasion. Bob goes out, only to be laughed at by the enemy. One enemy even comes up to him, hoping to get a good shot at him. Well, Bob didn&#039;t have anything to lose so he pointed at him and said &#039;&#039;Bangity bangity bang!&#039;&#039; and the guy fell down dead. He did the same thing with the magic carrot. Amazed at what was happening, he continued to fight. Then, a guy came slowly up to him and he would not die. Bob tried to shoot and stab him, but he wouldn&#039;t die. The last words poor Bob heard as he was being trampled over were &#039;&#039;Tankity tankity tank.&#039;&#039;

Basically, it&#039;s made up of two separate wordsâ€”â€œmankâ€ and â€œindâ€. What do these words mean? It&#039;s a mystery, and that&#039;s why so is mankind. <br /><br />We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can&#039;t scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me. <br /><br />If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason. <br /><br />If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is â€œGod is crying.â€ And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is â€œProbably because of something you did.â€ <br /><br />If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I&#039;d say Flippy, wouldn&#039;t you? You&#039;d be wrong, though. It&#039;s Hambone. <br /><br />Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me? Then it wouldn&#039;t seem quite so funny. <br /><br />Children need encouragement. If a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way he develops a good, lucky feeling. <br /><br />When you die, if you get a choice between going to regular heaven or pie heaven, choose pie heaven. It might be a trick, but if it&#039;s not, mmmmmmm, boy. <br /><br />I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they donâ€™t just go by size, because I bet there are some chihuahuas with some good ideas.</strong>

Sexual innuendos should be OK as long as they are not pornographic or verbally abusive.&nbsp; You can beat up on any political party since it is not a protected class&nbsp; </strong> </em> &nbsp;

When my husband comes home from having drinks with the guys, he picks a fight with me.&quot;<br /><br />Marriage Counselor: &quot;I have a real good solution for that.

Just gargle and gargle.&quot;<br /><br />Two weeks later she returns to the Marriage Counselor, and is fresh and relaxed. Woman: &quot;That was a brilliant idea!

				Some New Years jokes (so we can be nondenominational)<br /><br />A Bad Dream?<br />Jemima was taking an afternoon nap on New Year&#039;s Eve before the festivities. After she woke up, she confided to Max, her husband, &#039;I just dreamed that you gave me a diamond ring for a New Year&#039;s present. What do you think it all means?&#039;<br /><br />&#039;Aha, you&#039;ll know tonight,&#039; answered Max smiling broadly.<br /><br />At midnight , as the New Year was chiming, Max approached Jemima and handed her small package. Delighted and excited she opened it quickly. There in her hand rested a book entitled: &#039;The meaning of dreams&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Ode To The New Year<br />&#039;Twas the month after Christmas, and all through the house Nothing would fit me, not even a blouse.<br /><br />The cookies I&#039;d nibbled, the eggnog I&#039;d taste At the holiday parties had gone to my waist.<br /><br />When I got on the scales there arose such a number!<br />When I walked to the store (less a walk than a lumber). <br /><br />I&#039;d remember the marvellous meals I&#039;d prepared; The gravies and sauces and beef nicely rared,<br /><br />The wine and the rum balls, the bread and the cheese And the way I&#039;d never said, &#039;No thank you, please.&#039;<br /><br />As I dressed myself in my husband&#039;s old shirt And prepared once again to do battle with dirt - I said to myself, as I only can &#039;You can&#039;t spend a winter disguised as a man!&#039;<br /><br />So - away with the last of the sour cream dip, Get rid of the fruit cake, every cracker and chip<br /><br />Every last bit of food that I like must be banished &#039;Till all the additional ounces have vanished.<br /><br />I won&#039;t have a cookie - not even a lick.<br />I&#039;ll want only to chew on a long celery stick.<br /><br />I won&#039;t have hot biscuits, or corn bread, or pie, I&#039;ll munch on a carrot and quietly cry.<br /><br />I&#039;m hungry, I&#039;m lonesome, and life is a bore But isn&#039;t that what January is for?<br /><br />Unable to giggle, no longer a riot.<br />Happy New Year to all and to all a good diet! <br /><br />

				<strong>@ Really<br />2funny:</strong><br /><br />Let me jump on that train<br /><br /><br />â€¢Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day in my nightdress. Instead, I will move my computer into the bedroom. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will no longer waste my time relieving the past, instead I will spend it worrying about the future. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will not bore my boss by with the same excuse for taking leaves. I will think of some more excuses. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will do less laundry and use more deodorant. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will avoid taking a bath whenever possible and conserve more water. <br /><br /><br />â€¢Assure my lawyer that I will never again show up drunk at a custody hearing. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will give up chocolates totally. 100%. Completely. Honestly.... <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will try to figure out why I *really* need nine e-mail addresses. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will stop sending e-mails to my wife (husband).<br /><br /><br />â€¢I resolve to work with neglected children -- my own. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will stop sending e-mail, ICQ, Instant Messages and be on the phone at the same time with the same person. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will spend less than one hour a day on the Internet. This, of course, will be hard to estimate since I&#039;m not a clock watcher. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will read the manual... just as soon as I can find it.<br /><br /><br />â€¢I will think of a password other than &quot;password.&quot; <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will not tell the same story at every get together. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I won&#039;t worry so much. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will cut my hair. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will grow my hair. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will stop considering other people&#039;s feelings when they so obviously don&#039;t consider mine - if that unwashed fellow sits next to me again, I&#039;ll tell him he stinks! <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will be more imaginative. <br /><br /><br />â€¢I will not ring the stewardess button on airplanes just to get her phone number. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				There&#039;s a man sitting at a bar just looking at his drink. He stays like that for half an hour. Then, a big trouble-making truck driver steps next to him, takes the drink from the guy, and just drinks it all down. <br /><br />The poor man starts crying. The truck driver says, &quot;Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I&#039;ll buy you another drink. I just can&#039;t stand seeing a man crying.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No, it&#039;s not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I&#039;m late to my office. My boss, in an outrage, fires me. When I leave the building to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police say they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away. I go home and when I get there, I find my wife sleeping with the gardener. I leave home and come to this bar. And when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison.&quot; <br /><br />

Soon thereafter, he reluctantly joined us for our 5:30 a.m. jogs on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.<br /><br />After a month of running, we decided that my friend might be hooked, especially when he said he had discovered what &quot;runner&#039;s euphoria&quot; was. &quot;Runner&#039;s euphoria,&quot; he explained, &quot;is what I feel at 5:30 on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.&quot; -- Neil P.

How cool can it be?&quot; -- Judi Moore<br /><br />Eating healthier:<br />The teacher in our Bible class asked a woman to read from the Book of Numbers about the Israelites wandering in the desert. &quot;The Lord heard you when you wailed, &#039;If only we had meat to eat!&#039; &quot; she began. &quot;Now the Lord will give you meat. You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, or ten or twenty days, but for a monthâ€”until you loathe it.&quot;<br /><br />When the woman finished, she paused, looked up, and said, &quot;Hey, isn&#039;t that the Atkins diet?&quot;&nbsp; -- David Martino

				@ Madalyn...<em>I can relate to the old man&nbsp; &nbsp;</em> :2funny:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">The following Joke is Rated<br /></span> (http://www.logonica.com/data/r/001/rated_pg13.eps.png)<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 13pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>My First Condom </strong> </span> </div> <br /><strong><br />I recall my first time with a condom. I was 16. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at Parchen&#039;s pharmacy. In those days it took a lot of guts to go in a store and ask for that kind of item because everyone in town knew me and there was no doubt the young lady (I think her name was Delores) knew what they were for. <br /><br /><br />She was working as an assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was really embarrassed by the whole procedure. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, &#039;No, not really.&#039; <br /><br /><br />So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure <br /><br /><br />I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was. &#039;Just a minute,&#039; she said, and walked to the door and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. &#039;Do these excite you?&#039; She asked. <br /><br /><br />Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. &#039;Well, come on&#039;, she said, &#039;We don&#039;t have much time.&#039; <br /><br /><br />So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful that, unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was done within a few moments. <br /><br /><br />She looked at me with a bit of a frown. &#039;Did you put that condom on, Vince?&#039; she asked. I said, &#039;sure did,&#039; and held up my thumb to show her. <br /><br /><br />She then beat the shit out of me.... <br /><br /><br />Women have always been hard for me to figure out.</strong>

				<strong>Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years. He eventually decides to go and see a&nbsp; Doctor.<br />&nbsp;<br />The doctor said, &#039;Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. <br /><br />You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.&nbsp; &nbsp; The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.&#039; <br /><br />Joe was shocked and depressed.&nbsp; &nbsp; He wondered if he had anything to live for.&nbsp; &nbsp; He had no choice but to go under the knife.&nbsp; &nbsp; When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person.&nbsp; &nbsp; He could make a new beginning and live a new life. <br /><br />He saw a men&#039;s clothing store and thought, &#039;That&#039;s what I need.. A new suit.&#039; <br /><br />He entered the shop and told the salesman, &#039;I&#039;d like a new suit.&#039; <br /><br />The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, &#039;Let&#039;s see... size 44 long.&#039; <br /><br />Joe laughed, &#039;That&#039;s right, how did you know?&#039; <br /><br />&#039;Been in the business 60 years!&#039; the tailor said. <br /><br />Joe tried on the suit and it fit perfectly. <br />As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, &#039;How about a new shirt?&#039; <br /><br />Joe thought for a moment and then said, &#039;Sure.&#039; <br /><br />The salesman eyed Joe and said, &#039;Let&#039;s see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.&#039; <br /><br />Joe was surprised, &#039;That&#039;s right, how did you know?&#039; <br /><br />&#039;Been in the business 60 years.&#039; <br /><br />Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly. <br /><br />Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, &#039;How about some new underwear?&#039; <br /><br />Joe thought for a moment and said, &#039;Sure..&#039; <br /><br />The salesman said, &#039;Let&#039;s see... size 36. <br /><br />Joe laughed, &#039;Ah ha! I got you! I&#039;ve worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old..&#039; <br /><br />The salesman shook his head, &#039;You can&#039;t wear a size 34.&nbsp; &nbsp;A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.&#039; <br /><br /><br /></strong><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">New suit - $400 <br />New shirt - $36 <br />New underwear - $8<br /><strong><br />Second Opinion - PRICELESS :o</strong></span></div>

				A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.. As he settled in, he glanced up and saw the most beautiful woman boarding the plane..<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat ... As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his..<br />&nbsp;<br />Eager to strike up a conversation he blurted out, &quot;Business trip or pleasure?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />She turned, smiled and said, &quot;Business. I&#039;m going to the Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston &quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.<br />&nbsp;<br />Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, &quot;What&#039;s your business role at this convention?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Lecturer,&quot; she responded. &quot;I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Really?&quot; he said. &quot;And what kind of myths are there?&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Well,&quot; she explained, &quot;one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best.<br />&nbsp;<br />I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I shouldn&#039;t really be discussing all of this with you. I don&#039;t even know your name..&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Tonto,&quot; the man said, &quot;Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me&nbsp; Bubba.&quot;...............................<br /><br />

All responded this time, except one man, an avid golfer named Walter Barnes, who attended church only when the weather was bad.<br />&quot;Mr. Barnes, it&#039;s obviously not a good morning for golf. It&#039;s good to see you here today. Are you not willing to forgive your enemies?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t have any,&quot; he replied gruffly.<br /><br />&quot;Mr. Barnes, that is very unusual. How old are you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Ninety-eight,&quot; he replied. The congregation stood up and clapped&nbsp; their hands.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, Mr. Barnes, would you please come down in front &amp; tell us all how a person can live ninety-eight years &amp; not have an enemy in the world?&quot;<br /><br />The old golfer tottered down the aisle, stopped in front of the pulpit, turned around, faced the congregation, and said simply, &quot;I outlived all the sons of bitches.&quot; <br />&nbsp;<br />

				<div align="center"> In Pharmacology, all drugs have two names, a trade name and generic<br />name. For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of<br />Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also call<br />Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.<br /><br /><br /><br />The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful<br />consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced<br />that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. Also<br />considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of<br />course, Ibepokin.<br /><br /><br /><br />Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in<br />liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage<br />suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to<br />literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this<br />a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of &quot;cocktails&quot;,<br />&quot;highballs&quot; and just a good old-fashioned &quot;stiff drink&quot;. Pepsi will<br />market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast implants<br />and Viagra today than on Alzheimer&#039;s research. This means that by 2040,<br />there should be a large elderly population with perky boobs and huge<br />erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you don&#039;t send this to five old friends right away there will be five<br />fewer people laughing in the world. </div> <br />

				&nbsp;<br />A 54 year old woman had a heart attack and was taken to the hospital. <br /><br />While on the operating table she had a near death experience.. Seeing God<br />she asked &quot;Is my time up?&quot; <br /><br />God said, &quot;No, you have another 43 years, 2 months and 8 days to live.&quot; <br /><br />Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the hospital and have a<br />face-lift, liposuction, breast implants and a tummy tuck. <br /><br />She even had someone come in and change her hair color and brighten her<br />teeth! Since she had so much more time to live, she figured she might as<br />well make the most of it. <br /><br />After her last operation, she was released from the hospital. While crossing<br />the street on her way home, she was killed by an ambulance. <br /><br />Arriving in front of God, she demanded, &quot;I thought you said I had another 43<br />years? Why didn&#039;t you pull me from out of the path of the ambulance?&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />God replied: &quot;Wow! I didn&#039;t recognize you.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				Funny Fortune Cookie SayingsHere are some really funny sayings from fortune cookies:<br /><br />â€¢A closed mouth gathers no feet.&nbsp; <br />â€¢A conclusion is simply the place where you got tired of thinking. <br />â€¢A cynic is only a frustrated optimist. <br />â€¢A fanatic is one who can&#039;t change his mind, and won&#039;t change the subject. <br />â€¢An alien of some sort will be appearing to you shortly. <br />â€¢Do not mistake temptation for opportunity. <br />â€¢Flattery will go far tonight. <br />â€¢He who laughs at himself never runs out of things to laugh at. <br />â€¢He who laughs last is laughing at you. <br />â€¢He who throws dirt is losing ground.&nbsp; <br />â€¢Some men dream of fortunes, others dream of cookies. <br />â€¢The greatest danger could be your stupidity.&nbsp; <br />â€¢The world may be your oyster, but it doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll get its pearl.&nbsp; <br />â€¢You will be hungry again in one hour. <br />â€¢You can always find happiness at work on Friday. <br />â€¢Confucius say: if you think youâ€™re going to sum up your whole life on this little bit of paper, youâ€™re crazy. <br />The following fortunes were actually found in fortune cookies but they are not typical. They are a bit strange, some are typos, but they are still funny fortune cookie sayings:<br /><br />â€¢A starship ride has been promised to you by the galactic wizard. <br />â€¢A tub and a rub will change your day. <br />â€¢Because of your melodic nature, the moonlight never misses an appointment. <br />â€¢Confucius say you have heart as big as Texas. <br />â€¢Donâ€™t behave with cold manners.&nbsp; <br />â€¢Donâ€™t forget you are always on our minds. <br />â€¢Fortune not found? Abort, Retry, Ignore <br />â€¢Help! I am being held prisoner in a Chinese bakery. <br />â€¢Itâ€™s about time I got out of that cookie. <br />â€¢Never forget a friend. Especially if he owes you. <br />â€¢Never wear your best pants when you go to fight for freedom. <br />â€¢Only listen to the fortune cookie; disregard all other fortune telling units. <br />â€¢Someone will invite you to a Karaoke party. <br />â€¢Suppose you can get what you want. <br />â€¢That wasnâ€™t chicken. <br />â€¢There is no mistake so great as that of being always right.&nbsp; <br />â€¢You love Chinese food. <br />â€¢You will gain admiration from your peers.&nbsp; <br />â€¢You will receive a fortune cookie. <br />

				Sorry been a little down lately and haven&#039;t been posting funnies ...<br /><br />A man goes to his doctor for a complete checkup.

You&#039;re dying and you don&#039;t have much time,&quot; the doctor says.<br /><br />&quot;Oh no, that&#039;s terrible. How long have I got?&quot; the man asks.<br /><br />&quot;10...&quot; says the doctor.<br /><br />&quot;10? 10 what? Months? Weeks?

				And ...<br /><br />A man went to see his doctor because he was suffering from a miserable cold. His doctor prescribed some pills, but they didn&#039;t help.<br />On his next visit the doctor gave him a shot, but that didn&#039;t do any good.<br /><br />On his third visit the doctor told the man, &quot;Go home and take a hot bath. As soon as you finish bathing throw open all the windows and stand in the draft.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;But doc,&quot; protested the patient, &quot;if I do that, I&#039;ll get pneumonia.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;I can cure pneumonia.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				A doctor at an insane asylum decided to take his patients to a baseball game.<br /><br />For weeks in advance, he coached his patients to respond to his commands.<br /><br />When the day of the game arrived, everything seemed to be going well. As the National Anthem started.......the doctor yelled, &quot;Up Nuts&quot; And the patients complied by standing up.<br /><br />After the anthem ...he yelled, &quot;Down Nuts&quot;. And they all sat back down in their seats.<br /><br />After a home run was hit, the doctor yelled, &quot;Cheer Nuts&quot;. They all brokeout into applause and cheered.<br /><br />When the umpire made a particularly bad call against the star of the home team, the Doctor yelled, &quot;Booooo Nuts!!!&quot; and they all started booing and cat calling.<br /><br />Thinking things were going very well. The doctor decided to go get a beer and a hot dog, leaving his assistant in charge.<br /><br />When he returned, there was a riot in progress. Finding his assistant, the doctor asked,&quot; What in the world happened? &quot;<br /><br />The assistant replied, &quot;Well, everything was going just fine till a vendor passed by and yelled PEANUTS!&quot;<br />

				<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />At Heathrow Airport in England, a 300-foot red carpet was stretched out to Air Force One and President Bush strode to a warm but dignified handshake from Queen Elizabeth II. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />They rode in a silver 1934 Bentley to the edge of central London where they boarded an open 17th century coach hitched to six magnificent white horses. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As they rode toward Buckingham Palace, each looking to their side and waving to the thousands of cheering Britons lining the streets, all was going well. This was indeed a glorious display of pageantry and dignity. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Suddenly the scene was shattered when the right rear horse let rip the most horrendous, earth-shattering, eye-smarting blast of flatulence, and the coach immediately filled with noxious fumes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Uncomfortable, but maintaining control, the two dignitaries did their best to ignore the whole incident, but then the Queen decided that was a ridiculous manner with which to handle a most embarrassing situation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />She turned to Mr. Bush and explained, &quot;Mr. President, please accept my regrets. I&#039;m sure you understand that there are some things even a Queen cannot control.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />George W., ever the Texas gentleman, replied, &quot;Your Majesty, please don&#039;t give the matter another thought. You know, if you hadn&#039;t said something I would have assumed it was one of the horses.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />
