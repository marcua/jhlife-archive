				Title: <strong>non-fiction book recommendations?</strong><br />

				I&#039;m going to start shopping for books for my father for Christmas sometime in the next few days.&nbsp; He is a voracious reader and likes only non-fiction like history and politics.&nbsp; Challenging reading is fine as he has a PhD, but I usually try not to get him something that is entirely academic.&nbsp; Because he reads so much it&#039;s important to get him books that have been published this year only.&nbsp; Otherwise it&#039;s likely that he&#039;s already read them.<br /><br />Normally I go online and read reviews on sites like NPR.org or the New Yorker.<br /><br />Anyone have any specific book suggestions or can you tell me where you go to read what the critics are recommending?&nbsp; Short reviews are preferable to long ones.

				I don&#039;t have much time to read for pleasure these days.&nbsp; But an author whose work I have always enjoyed is Wendell Berry.&nbsp; He is a passionate advocate for traditional rural values, and a critic of our urbanized, consumerist society.&nbsp; I don&#039;t identify much with his values, perspective, or politics -- I am a suburbanite by birth and an urbanist at heart and much more of a centrist politically.&nbsp; Yet this former tobacco farmer&#039;s social critique and clear values-based vision, combined with his beautiful writing, are nothing short of inspiring to me.<br /><br />Here is one book I enjoyed:<br />http://www.amazon.com/What-Are-People-Wendell-Berry/dp/0865474370<br /><br />A great book of essays for people who love the craft of writing:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Standing-Words-Essays-Wendell-Berry/dp/1593760558/<br /><br />And two newer books I haven&#039;t read:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Art-Commonplace-Agrarian-Essays-Wendell/dp/1593760078<br />http://www.amazon.com/Way-Ignorance-Other-Essays/dp/1593761198

				A few recent histories/biographies worth checking out are:<br /><br />Boone<br />http://www.amazon.com/Boone-Biography-Robert-Morgan/dp/1565124553/<br /><br />A Land So Strange<br />http://www.amazon.com/Land-Strange-Extraordinary-Shipwrecked-Sixteenth/dp/0465068405/<br /><br />I&#039;ve read parts of both of them for pieces I was writing and then moved them to my ever-growing stack of books that I definitely want to finish. (It&#039;s the downside of writing about books--sometimes you can&#039;t just sit and enjoy them).<br /><br />And here&#039;s a link to a fall/winter book guide I wrote:<br /><br />http://www.americanwaymag.com/tabid/2855/tabidext/3209/default.aspx<br />The David Halberstam book may be a perfect fit for your dad.<br /><br />And, actually, here&#039;s a link to the 2006 guide -- maybe there are a few in there for him:<br /><br />http://www.americanwaymag.com/PastIssues/December152006/DownLow/tabid/2484/Default.aspx

				Jennsch, I was so pleased with the recco. for the Halberstam book &quot;The Coldest Winter&quot; for my dad that I ordered it on amazon for Christmas.&nbsp; One issue I&#039;ve had in the past is siblings buying the same book and giving it to my dad before me on Christmas day and I was hoping that wouldn&#039;t happen this year.&nbsp; In fact I even sent an email to family members asking what books they were buying for him so we wouldn&#039;t have duplicates. Well, here I am at my dad&#039;s house two days before Christmas and what does he have on his coffee table?&nbsp; Yup, the Halberstam book.&nbsp; <br /><br />I told him about your recommendation. I also asked him who bought it for him and he bought it for himself to read on a recent vacation.&nbsp; He says it&#039;s a wonderful book and that you were right on with your recommendation. . . turns out TOO right on!&nbsp; Well, as they say, it &#039;s the thought that counts.

				I also got &quot;The Nine: Inside the Secret Life of the Supreme Court&quot; - Time will tell whether anyone else got him that one and also, a little later, whether he reads it and likes it!

				Well I sure missed Christmas, but if your dad has a birthday or other special occasion coming up, I have very high praise for <em>Collapse </em> by Jared Diamond.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Collapse-Societies-Choose-Fail-Succeed/dp/0670033375
