				Sorry to hear this.<br /><br />When I first moved to Jackson Hts I was advised to avoid the 90th St area due to criminal activity (gangs?).<br />It appears that still holds. <br /><br />

				She looks very familiar to me. I think she may have worked as a cashier at the Natural Market on 37th Ave. The <em>NY Times</em> story said she occasionally worked as a cashier:<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/nyregion/nyc-shootings-murders-crime.html (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/nyregion/nyc-shootings-murders-crime.html)

				The police have arrested the alleged shooter. A 31 year-old adult, more than old enough to fully understand the consequences of his reckless actions. <br /><br />https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-nyc-murder-queens-mom-stray-bullet-suspect-caught-20201003-3y7fb7ujgbfalnde2vfyfze5xi-story.html#nt=pf-single%20chain~new-left-chain~flex%20feature~curated~straybullet-906a~3Y7FB7UJGBFALNDE2VFYFZE5XI~1~1~1~5~art%20yes

				&nbsp;It has to be some small consolation they caught the shooter here. Someone will pay for taking this<br />woman&#039;s life and leaving her family to grieve. The part of it being in her own home is just awful<br />and still can&#039;t get my head around it even though same happened to Breonna Taylor and who knows <br />how many others with variations on a story. Very sad for her loved ones.
