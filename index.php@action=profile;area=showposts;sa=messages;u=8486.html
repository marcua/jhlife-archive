					The only thing Doctor Ron Tompkins cares about right now is doing damage control. He had his chance to refute all the claims I made when he was called up by the Queens Courier reporter who covered this story (see here: <a href="http://queenscourier.com/articles/2011/09/17/news/top_stories/doc4e6fc33460279765095023.txt" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queenscourier.com/articles/2011/09/17/news/top_stories/doc4e6fc33460279765095023.txt</a>) but he didn&#039;t. When the reporter started to ask him questions, Dr. Tompkins abruptly hung up the phone.<br /><br />Dr. Tompkins clearly states that &quot;None of Mr. Dunn&#039;s claims are true.&quot; None of them? Really? Refute them. I challenge you. Publicly.<br /><br />I was raised Catholic and was brought up with Christian ethics - not to lie, not to take advantage of people... I took seriously what I saw as core Christian beliefs to fight for social justice. What galls me is that Dr Tompkins ends his message with the word blessings. He is trying to use the fact that he was a pastor for years to his advantage and to be sure, it works with some people. How can men of the cloth ever lie, ever betray, ever take advantage of people. As a Catholic I don&#039;t have to tell you how hypocritical and how deceiving men of the cloth can be. Dr. Tompkins, out of all the priests and pastors I&#039;ve come across, is the most un-Christian, unethical one.<br /><br />When he fired me I told him that if he did that I would become homeless and be without health insurance. I explained to him that I have a blood disorder and if left uninsured it could become potentially fatal. His response was that he didn&#039;t care. I became homeless, and am still jobless and uninsured. <br /><br />Dr. Tompkins and the man I&#039;m sure he claims he lives by (Jesus) are worlds apart. Jesus never fired anyone, he never made anyone homeless, he never put anyone in harm&#039;s way and he never lied.... I&#039;m sure Dr. Tompkins&#039; actions would be a shock to me had I not grown up Catholic and learned from a young age not to take everything priests say seriously.<br /><br />As for the whistleblower policy, I always understood that was in place in case anyone working at 82nd Street was witness to some form of abuse, sexual or otherwise. Who were my coworkers supposed to run to when Mallory Tompkins (Dr. Tompkins daughter) told them to give hamburger buns contaminated with mouse droppings to children and parents at the BBQ? Should they have run to Mallory&#039;s father? Her sister? Her brother-in-law? The choices were non-existent. And if they spoke up about it, like I did, they most certainly would have been fired.<br /><br />As far as my wages. If they have all been fairly paid then why, Dr. Ron, did you and the other admins refuse to respond to my messages with the simple request to see a copy of my time sheet from the last pay period (which I was never shown). To date, you have still refused to do this. I am being completely open and honest about everything. I ask that you do the same and show me the time sheet because the math just didn&#039;t add up.

					Hi everyone,<br /><br />The Queens Courier recently published an article about me getting fired from 82nd Street Academics for raising concerns about the mouse infestation there. You can read the story here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2011/09/15/news/top_stories/doc4e6fc33460279765095023.txt#blogcomments" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.queenscourier.com/articles/2011/09/15/news/top_stories/doc4e6fc33460279765095023.txt#blogcomments</a><br /><br />There&#039;s more background to the story here. This was originally published in the newspaper Voice of The Independent Workers Movement (Voc de Movimiento Independiente de Trabajadores) which is based in nearby Woodside. I will be happy to answer any questions, especially from parents, if you have any.<br /><br />Brendan Dunn,<br />former janitor at 82nd Street Academics<br /><br />Fired from a Rodent Infested Preschool but Fighting for Justice<br /><br />In late June I was fired from my job as a janitor at 82nd Street Academics, a private preschool in Jackson Heights, Queens. The school has been around for decades and has a reputation of providing excellent education to children. Unfortunately the school took a turn for the worse when Dr. Ron Tompkins took over as director after acting as pastor at the Methodist church next to the school for many years. Dr. Ron Tompkins just so happened to hire his daughters Mallory and Courtney and his son-in-law Amar as the other administrators of the school. When I first started working there I thought it was too good to be true â€“ I was offered health insurance and paid vacation, two things I never received from a job before. It did not take long for me to see through the fake professionalism of the family that runs the school and to realize the appalling conditions of the school, conditions I had issues with that ultimately led to my termination.<br /><br />As the only janitor hired by the school it was my duty to ensure that the school maintained a high standard for the health and safety of the students and everyone who worked there. I was shocked that half of the plumbing was not working when I started working there. Children frequently had to walk in water from overflowing toilets. The teachers and I were bothered by this but the school administration hardly seemed concerned. The Community United Methodist Church that owns and rents the building to the school decided to do something about it only after I warned that the Health Department would shut down the school if they inspected it.<br /><br />When I swept the sidewalks, shoveled the snow and cleaned up the trash around the school and church every day, people on the street would comment how clean I had made that block. Before I started working there in February, there was no janitor at the school. The school had the reputation of being the dirtiest block in the neighborhood and rat sightings around the building were not uncommon. The situation inside the school was worse. I did everything in my power to improve the conditions only to run against a church and school administration that had a blatant disregard for the health and safety of the students and workers at the school.<br /><br />The worst problem was the kitchen, shared by the school and the church and daily used for storing and preparing breakfast, lunch and snacks for the children. The kitchen has not been changed in the sixty years it has been there. There is excessive water damage in the kitchen, rotting walls and, like the rest of the building, it is highly infested with mice. In the five short months I worked there I picked up nearly 200 dead mice, most from the kitchen, and caught a dozen live mice. Every morning I swept the mouse droppings off the kitchen floor, cleaned them off the kitchen counters and sanitized the room. I talked with the exterminator who told me how he could end the infestation but the only thing stopping him was that the school refused to give the resources needed to fix the problem.<br /><br />On June 22, to my absolute shock and horror, I discovered a locked cabinet in the kitchen literally carpeted with mouse droppings. I immediately informed the administrators who all showed neither disgust nor surprise. I asked for the combination of the lock to the cabinet (which was owned by the church) but nobody seemed to know it. My supervisor Mary contacted someone form the church who informed her that they would possibly take care of it in a week. I was told by Dr. Ronâ€™s daughter Mallory that I could cut the lock with bolt cutters so I did, cleaned the droppings out and sanitized the cabinet. The next day, on June 23rd Mary asked me what I did with the lock. I informed her that I threw it out. The shock, horror and disgust that should have appeared in Maryâ€™s facial expressions on hearing about the mouse droppings only appeared on hearing this recent news. She immediately called the church and I was told to pay for the damaged lock. I told Mary that if the Health Department and if the parents of the students knew what actually went on in the kitchen, they would be very upset and that I value the health and safety of the students and workers over some church property.<br /><br />It did not take long for the administrators and church pastors to rush to the school over this emergency. I only wish they would have acted with the same concern and speed over the severe rodent infestation. After building a case against me off of Maryâ€™s lies and Malloryâ€™s denial that she gave me the green light to cut the lock, Dr. Ron Tompkins fired me. I informed him that his firing would make me homeless (which it did) and withouth health insurance. Upon hearing this news, the former Methodist pastor and current director of a preschool threw me on the street, threatening to call the police if I didnâ€™t leave fast enough. It was only after I was fired that I discovered he fired a teacher before I worked there for threatening to call the Health Department over the same issues. I also learned that Mallory knowingly gave food that was contaminated with mouse droppings to parents and teachers at a school BBQ.<br /><br />After I was fired the school refused to give me my last paycheck and eventually started to ignore my emails and phone calls. I approached the Independent Workers Movement for assistance and on August 3 I went back to 82nd Street along with twelve supporters from the IWM to deliver a demand letter to Dr. Ron asking for my last paycheck among other things. It was during a BBQ for the new parents and students to the school so we caught him by surprise. His voice and his hands were visibly shaking with fear as I gave him the demand letter and informed him that if my demands were not met soon then â€œwe would be backâ€. He promised to get back to me the next day. Although I am no longer a janitor at the school I will continue to fight for whatâ€™s rightfully mine and continue to look out for the health and safety of the students and workers there. I am fortunate to have the Independent Workers Movement involved in this struggle for justice every step of the way.<br /><br /><br />
