				Full service gym.&nbsp; After having a membership in the Planet Fitness for a couple of months a few years ago, gyms with similar pricing schedules make me suspect.&nbsp; PF was messy, filled with machines that didn&#039;t work and had no free weights, aside from barbells that went upto 60lbs.&nbsp; Plus, at the risk of sounding elitist, the low prices attracts crowds and a bad element.&nbsp; Never saw a gym with members who had so little gym etiquette, who had so little regard for the gym itself and a staff who couldn&#039;t care less then i did at the PF.&nbsp; I quit that and went over to Health and Fitness which is a chasm better and the prices are still reasonable.&nbsp; I would love to be proven wrong by the coming Blink Gym of course.<br /><br />Oh that and a good fishmonger (Pacific is excellent, but a bit of a hoof from the 82nd street area).

				I&#039;m surprised that no one else has brought this up:<br /><br />There are only five choices, therefore if you don&#039;t agree with any of the choices your opinion doesn&#039;t count.

				<br />Hi, sorry&nbsp; to stray from your options, but we need something rather simple; a nice bar, nothing fancy, but a place with some charm and nice lighting, where you can get a good glass of wine, had a friend visiting me recently, and I felt bad I couldn&#039;t think of any place around 37th ave where I could help my friend get a decent glass of wine.<br />And I know Expresso 77 has wine,but as you know, that place is extremely limited with seating.&nbsp; <br /><br />We should&#039;t have to trek over to Astoria for a decent glass of wine, that&#039;s kind of ridiculous, right?<br /><br />~Peace<br /><br />
