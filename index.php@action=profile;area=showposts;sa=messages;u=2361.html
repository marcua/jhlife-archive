					Co-ops are cheaper to buy but not always cheaper to maintain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Monthly maintenance costs for co-ops usually include the shareholder’s share of payments on the underlying mortgage. This can increase monthly maintenance costs for a co-op beyond -- sometimes well beyond -- the combined monthly amount of common charges/RE taxes you would pay for a condo.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

					There is no meaningful link between the number of undocumented people in a particular and an increased crime rate.&nbsp; On the contrary, as a general matter undocumented people tend to be very law abiding and hard working -- and go out of their way to avoid situations which could give rise to contact with police/court system.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If the hysterical narrative being pushed by the current administration -- that undocumented people represent a violent, existential threat to the country -- were at all true, then neighborhoods like JH, Elmhurst, Flushing etc. would be unbearable, a living hell.&nbsp; &nbsp;But in fact the reverse is true.&nbsp; Having lived in JH nearly 20 years and become very familiar with surrounding areas as well, I know from personal experience that these are all vibrant and generally very safe communities&nbsp; filled with hardworking people, some of whom happen to be undocumented.&nbsp; Indeed, I would suggest that the increase in immigration over the last 30 years, including undocumented people, has made these communities safer and more stable than they would otherwise have been. <br /><br />People espousing the “deport them all” viewpoint should be careful of what they wish for -- the wholesale loss of undocumented people would have a devastating impact on the economy and social fabric of JH and Western Queens generally.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					Fully support protecting the architectural integrity of the neighborhood -- but can’t see how extending landmark protection to the area where this building is going up could reasonably be justified.&nbsp; Buildings in that area have little or no aesthetic or historic value and this high rise, at least based on the drawings (which I understand may be a bit idealized), seems to be a huge improvement over what was there before.&nbsp; While new building will be relatively tall, at that location -- on the edge of Jackson Heights, overlooking BQE and the 7 train with mostly commercial buildings nearby -- don’t see much downside in allowing the additional height.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					I see all these developments as collectively being a positive for Queens and NYC, with qualifications.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On the upside, there is a huge, unmet need for housing and all these towers do help to some degree, although unfortunately only for a relatively small group of well-heeled buyers and renters. Also, having high-end, high density development clustered in LIC may reduce some of the density and gentrification pressure on older established neighborhoods like JH, Sunnyside, Woodside, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus, the area is served by multiple subway lines and is only a stop or two into Manhattan so the pressure on mass transit is less than would be the case if comparable developments were to spring up in other parts of Queens.&nbsp; If we have to build up, up and up, this seems just about the best place to do so.<br /><br />Aesthetically speaking, for me at least, there is a kind of glitzy appeal to seeing all these towers together, particularly as the 7 train threads its way through. (They already look much better than “luxury” towers from the 60s and 70s on the UES and elsewhere, which were horrible when built and have gotten worse with age.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />It would be much better if the light manufacturing jobs that used to dominate that area were still plentiful providing working people with living wage jobs.&nbsp; But given economic forces at large, those seem to unfortunately be disappearing (if not already all gone) irrespective of demand for residential units and office towers.&nbsp; It would also be much better if these units were more affordable but for reasons that I do not fully understand it seems impossible to build units for middle/moderate income people in NYC without heavy subsidies. <br />

					One story commercial buildings are best suited for suburban strip malls and similar roadside venues, where space is not at a premium and everyone drives.&nbsp; In an urban area, it doesn’t seem to be the best use of the property. <br /><br />Hard to think of any great cities where one story buildings are the norm. Even in low rise European cities of great beauty - Barcelona, Paris et al. -- buildings are typically at least 5 to 6 stories high, particularly on central commercial avenues. <br /><br />Here in NYC, my understanding is that most of these one story structure were built as provisional tax payers and never meant to be part of the permanent city fabric. <br /><br />At a minimum, I would hope that people fairly consider what the developer is proposing before rejecting this out of hand.&nbsp; I completely agree that a five story mediocrity (like the 90s era condos nearby on 86th street) would not be good.&nbsp; But it seems to me that the community has an opportunity to put significant pressure on the developer to do better than that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have any plans been submitted?&nbsp; <br />

					84-11, while part of a landmarked area, is not in itself architecturally distinguished.&nbsp; A reasonably good design, i.e. one which is consistent with context of other buildings in area, could be an improvement over what’s there now.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />A central concern with proposal seems to be that a larger building will block light and increase shadows.&nbsp; &nbsp;But further down 37th Avenue&nbsp; there are six story buildings on either side of the street, and I don’t find that to be particularly dark or oppressive.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other concern seems to be increased population density. But Jackson Heights has been a very dense urban neighborhood for many decades&nbsp; -- and rightly so given its proximity to transportation and Manhattan.&nbsp; Don’t see that some population increase, within reason, would be harmful and it could be a benefit.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Understand that the original Jackson Heights model, going back nearly a hundred years ago, was much less dense but that was from a different era and ultimately proved to be unsustainable.)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I strongly support maintaining architectural integrity of the neighborhood but I don&#039;t see this as a real threat and again, depending on design, could be an improvement. <br />

					Crazy price escalations are a benefit if you are selling and moving to a cheaper area.&nbsp; They are also an obvious benefit to realtors. Otherwise, however, home prices which are unaffordable to the vast majority of New Yorkers benefit no one. <br /><br />And if prices go up too high too quickly, which may be starting to happen in NYC, there is an obvious risk of an asset bubble -- which has devastating consequences when the increase is no longer sustainable and prices begin to move just as quickly in the opposite direction.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Well there are actually quite a number of options in Queens for people with 1.5 million to spend.&nbsp; Sunnyside Gardens is a lovely and historic complex close to the City, which I think is generally under a million for a house (albeit smaller than the one on 86 St).&nbsp; Kew Gardens is further out, but it is connected to the train, is a beautiful neighborhood and has gorgeous houses selling in the 1 to 1.5 million range.&nbsp; Forest Hills Gardens, mentioned above, is connected to the train, very well established and very charming -- its more expensive but you could still find something quite nice for $1.5 million I&#039;m sure. <br /><br />Then, someone with $1.5 million to spend (and interested in a house with a yard like the place on 86th Street) could well look to inner suburbs in Westchester, like Bronxville or Pelham -- which have a very quick commute, are very well established and are affordable to people with $1.5 million in their pocket. <br /><br />For me, Jackson Heights beats them all.&nbsp; But, realistically, given that there are a relatively small group of people with that kind of money to spend and a relatively large number of options available to the people willing to spend it, I&#039;m not sure that JH is likely to catapult into the higher end category.&nbsp; But then again I could be wrong, who knows?

					The recurring real estate fantasy is that prices can keep rising, rising, rising -- thanks to an ever-growing supply of people willing and able to pay.&nbsp; And if you buy and find that you can’t actually afford it, well then just sell the following year for a tidy profit.&nbsp; <br /><br />That actually may work for a while but over the long term it will not be sustainable -- at least outside of Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.&nbsp; The fact is there is a finite supply of people who can genuinely afford to pay $1.5 million for a house, even in NYC.&nbsp; You can be relatively well-heeled -- say part of an upper middle class professional household making comfortably into the six figures -- and $1.5 million is still going to be a bit of a stretch (unless you have some other independent income source, as I suppose some people do).&nbsp; <br /><br />And for the people who can readily afford it, there are plenty of other places to choose from with more cachet that JH (although personally, I much prefer it here).<br />

					If you are willing to go a bit further afield, the mid-Hudson valley -- starting in Northern Westchester and going up to about Poughkeepsie -- is generally affordable and there are some interesting, attractive and fairly lively towns along the Metro North line (which by the way has to be ranked among the most beautiful train rides in the country…)&nbsp; If you&#039;re looking for space and room to grow, while still maintaining some connection to NYC, there are a lot of possibilities in that area.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					Relatively low crime figures don’t really surprise me, as I have always felt quite secure in the area. <br /><br />It’s interesting, though, that at least based on this,&nbsp; JH seems to be meaningfully safer than the trendier parts of Brooklyn -- like Williamsburg, Fort Greene, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights --&nbsp; as well as many high end areas of Manhattan.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

					If the BID is such a win-win, why does it seem to be engendering such stubborn resistance from members of the business community on Roosevelt (most of whom I imagine are fairly shrewd individuals who understand what will and will not benefit their businesses over the long run)?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Are there any merchant groups along Roosevelt who are actually supporting the BID?&nbsp; Do the current patrons of the various stores and restaurants along Roosevelt (which include many families as pointed out above) support the BID? <br /><br />Not meant to be a rhetorical question -- would actually like to know. <br />

					On any given Saturday afternoon, there are crowds of people along Roosevelt Ave. and the 82nd Street corridor on either side of Roosevelt.&nbsp; I think that very few of them are there for sex trafficking, cocaine sales or illegal SS cards.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think that the vast majority of these people are patronizing clothing stores, 99 cents stores, appliance stores, restaurants and food stands and the various other businesses which line the avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are issues on Roosevelt, particularly later in the evening -- and sex trafficking is obviously unconscionable. <br /><br />But to broadly characterize the majority of businesses on Roosevelt as illegal &quot;fronts&quot; and the people who patronize them as lowlifes or criminals is highly misleading and creates a false picture of the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
