				http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/nyregion/13stop.html<br /><br />I don&#039;t really get it-- the photo essay has 12 photos of Little India and one of Rudy Volcano. &nbsp;And it claims to be an article featuring JH&#039;s diversity!!<br /><br /><br /><strong>December 13, 2009<br />Local Stop | Jackson Heights<br />A Vibrant, Polyglot Hub <br />By JENNIFER 8. LEE</strong><br /><br />Sprawling out from beneath the rumble of the elevated 7 train, Jackson Heights, Queens, may be the most diverse neighborhood in the most diverse county in the country. The low-slung brick garden apartments, designed as a middle-class alternative to tenements, have also proved attractive to immigrants: South Asians, Latin Americans and, more recently, arrivals from Tibet and Nepal. The food, wares and entertainment they have brought with them make Jackson Heights a bustling polyglot neighborhood not to be missed by tourists or New Yorkers. Conveniently, it is also one of the best-connected neighborhoods in Queens, with the Roosevelt Avenue subway stop linking the 7, E, F, G, R and V lines. <br /><br />NOON Gulzar Beauty Salon, 74-01B Roosevelt Avenue, (718) 779-2800, has all the linoleum charm of a barber shop. But it is a reasonably priced place to get rid of unwanted hair through either traditional Indian threading or waxing. The difference? Experiencing your pain as pinpricks spread out over time or in sudden, violent yanks. Eyebrows and upper lip each start at $5 (as does nose waxing). My attendant kept pushing a facial, which admittedly was a bargain at $20, or half off the standard price.<br /><br />12:30 P.M.The neighborhoodâ€™s Indian restaurants attracted the Zagat crowd long ago, but cutting-edge foodies are now drawn to the Himalayan eateries that have popped up for Tibetan and Nepali immigrants. Common offerings include thukpa, Tibetan noodle soup; momos, Himalayan dumplings; and samyeling, a beef patty encased in fried dough. (How can you go wrong with fried dough?) Two well-loved but hard-to-find spots are Bombay Chat and Samyeling, small counters tucked into 73-19 37th Road, that offer Tibetan and Indian street food in one place. To come upon the neon sign at the establishments â€” â€œCoffee Bagel Momo Teaâ€ â€” makes for an â€œOnly in New Yorkâ€ moment.<br /><br />2 P.M.Top off lunch with traditional Indian sweets, like orange spirals of jalebi, or marzipanlike kaju pista rolls. The treats are on the sugary side, but with their colors, geometric shapes and metallic foil, they look like Christmas ornaments. At Raja Sweets and Fast Food, 72-31 37th Avenue, (718) 424-1850, the treats range from $4.99 to $6.99 a pound.<br /><br />2:30 P.M.Wander down 74th Street and gawk at the dense concentration of sari and gold shops, each selling intricate jewelry by the gram. Some Indians say they prefer 22-karat gold because of its luster, malleability and long-term value. For more economical finds, try Golden Music, 37-13 74th Street, (718) 205-0211, which sells $8 workout DVDs featuring bhangra, traditional Indian dancing, spiced up by Sarina Jain (the â€œJane Fonda of Indiaâ€). Butala Emporium, 37-46 74th Street, (718) 899-5590, sells Meswak toothpaste, which is made from the twigs of the miswak tree, popular for tooth-cleaning in the Middle East and South Asia. Compared with online prices, the toothpaste is a bargain at $4.<br /><br />3:30 P.M. Stroll along 34th Avenue to the meditative labyrinth behind Community United Methodist Church, 81-10 35th Avenue, (718) 446-0690. Itâ€™s a bit of a walk, but you will encounter Jackson Heights emerging (Rudy Volcano boutique, 79-07 37th Avenue, (718) 651-7100) and vestigial (Jahnâ€™s Ice Cream parlor, 81-04 37th Avenue, (718) 651-0700). The paved labyrinth, a flat, circular space in the courtyard, is generally open to the public when the church is open. If the glass doors are locked, track down the custodian to admit you.<br /><br />4:30 P.M. Patel Brothers, 37-27 74th Street, (718) 898-3445, is the granddaddy of Indian groceries and a worthwhile stop before heading home. While known to immigrants<br /><br />Click link for rest of article

				At least there was one of Rudy Volcano and his lovely (famous) cat.<br /><br />Also, the reporter makes a big deal about what a long walk it was to get to 81st and 35th but I suspect she took a car service and that&#039;s why there are no photos or reports about anything on the way there or the way back besides the one stop at Rudy Volcano.

				I always liked Seth Kugel&#039;s writing. &nbsp;Doesn&#039;t he live in the neighborhood? &nbsp;Based on his last few months of writing it appears as though he has been down in South America. &nbsp;I wonder if he is returning to the nabe? &nbsp;He will probably notice many changes when / if he gets back.

				Actually, we are all the town of Flushing because there were big townships back in the 1880s etc ... Fluhsing, Jamaica, Oyster Bay, Hempstead ... all part of one county.&nbsp; The ones that left to join NYC in 1898 or so became Queens.<br /><br />The hint is the post office though ... the zip codes that are 113** are all &quot;Flushing&quot;.&nbsp; 114** is all Jamiaca.&nbsp; Long Island City, the Rockaways and even a bitty part of Floral Park, Bellerose where my school is have their own, though are all Queens NY!

				Here are a few more new strange ones about JH, this time from a blog. &nbsp;They were posted this week, on Jan. 8, 2010. <br /><br /><br />Jackson Heights: if it&#039;s green it must be a garden apartment &nbsp;(http://indiejourno.com/2010/01/08/jackson-heights-if-its-green-it-must-be-a-garden-apartment/)<br /><br />In Jackson Heights Part 1 (http://indiejourno.com/2010/01/08/in-jackson-heights-part-1/)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">excerpt</span> (click links for full articles)<br /><strong>In Jackson Heights â€“ Part 1</strong><br />As the 7 train climbs overland and clatters noisily into Queens, the demographic shift in the subway car is perceptible. Skin tones get darker, hemlines lower and necklines higher.<br /><br />The car slowly fills with Koreans, Hispanic families and middle- aged Indian men reading the newspaper.<br /><br />Incomprehensible chatter fills the air and boils down to a babble as the train pulls into Roosevelt Avenue stop.<br /><br />The train empties out as groups scurry into their different enclaves to either enjoy a lazy afternoon or get down to business.<br /><br /><strong>No Habla Espanol!</strong><br />As I get off the Roosevelt Avenue stop and walk across the rows of Mexican and Colombian restaurants, young panhandlers try to sell me fruits that I have never seen or Arepas I have never tasted.<br /><br />I ask an old man minding a newsstand for directions. He responds in rapid Spanish. He notes my expression of total and utter incomprehension and waves me away from the Spanish side towards the Indian Side of Jackson Heights that starts at 74th street.<br /><br />Is it just me, or does this place smell like Home?!<br />I knew I hit home-base, when I see the chaos on the streets. If we are what we drive, then the random parking, the honking and the abject jaywalking showed me the reassuring presence of less civic minded Indians.<br /><br />A harassed looking traffic cop, explained to me as she wrote out a ticket to a protesting young Indian male â€˜They would rather park on this one crowded street than go down three blocks and find some empty placesâ€™. Sounds just like home!<br /><br /><br />Loud Punjabi music blares in &quot;Little India&quot; - Jackson Heights (Pic: Smriti Rao)<br />The air gets thicker with music at each step. Loud Punjabi music blares from outside shops selling the latest Hindi, Punjabi and devotional music. A turbaned Sikh man hands me a leaflet for newly opened Mehak Beauty Parlor and says, in what can only be interpreted as a reprimand â€œEyebrows- Wax!â€ &nbsp;I pass.<br /><br />The market on 74th street, with the South Asian shops pulses and pounds like any other market from back home. This could be Delhi, Dhaka or just plain Jackson Heights.<br /><br />With an estimated 250 small and medium-sized businesses â€“ the South Asian community (including Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshi and Nepalis)- works within a two block radius from 74th street to 76th street.<br /><br />A relaxation of the immigration policies during the Kennedy Administration led to a sharp increase in immigration during the 1960â€™s. Thousands of Asians and Latin Americans arrived on the scene making Jackson Heights their home.<br /><br />It prompted some people to call this section of Queens â€˜The Ellis Island of the 20th centuryâ€™. By 1965, South Asian and Latino immigrants settled into their neighborhoods giving rise to â€˜Little Indiaâ€™ and â€˜Little Colombiaâ€™<br /><br />On 74th street, my greedy eyes spot a Kebab King in the corner, zoom into Jackson Diner which is â€˜world famous in New Yorkâ€™ and then settle on Delhi Heights â€“ one of the many places where one could drop by for authentic Indian Cuisine.<br /><br />The choices have now expanded to include restaurants that serve Afghan, Tibetan and Nepali cuisine.<br /><br />If you would rather whip up your own Dal Makhni or make a mean Paneer Tikka, then Patel Brothers is a virtual Wal-Mart of spices as you try and pick all the ingredients that go into a home cooked Indian meal. Patel Brothers also boasts of a clientele that comes in not just from &nbsp;New York City but also New Jersey and Connecticut.<br /><br /><strong>God Tussi Great Ho!</strong><br />Eagle Theatre in Jackson Heights screens all the latest Hindi movies <br />But apart from the food and shopping, Little Indiaâ€™s cultural aspirations would be miniscule if it did not include a large bit of Bollywood. At Eagle Theatre, visitors and residents of Jackson Heights get their weekly dose of drama and fantasy song and dance sequences.<br /><br />Audiences sigh and clap and indulge Bollywoodâ€™s absurdity as two long lost brothers unite half way across the world thanks to matching tattoos on their arms.<br /><br />Hard core hindi movie buffs can hop off the â€˜7â€™, trade popcorn for samosas and immerse themselves in 3 hours of magic and mayhem<br /><br /><br />

				I found the following statement from the first article a bit confusing.<br /><br /><em><strong>&quot;Owned by Co-ops- the apartments with their slate or tiled roofs, garages and fireplaces are expensive- selling for millions of dollars. Many of the pre-war co-ops boast of shared, private gardens, which open to the public once a year.&quot;</strong></em><br /><br />I know I&#039;ve seen some pricey apartments when browsing the real estate section of The Times, but do we really have apartments selling for million<strong>s</strong> of dollars?&nbsp; Do we?<br /><br />No comment would be complete without mentioning the header on one of the paragraphs... <strong><em>&quot;Attack of the Yuppies&quot;</em></strong>&nbsp; And another quote, <em><strong>&quot;Joe spits out â€˜yuppies! Theyâ€™re taking over this place&quot; </strong></em> That&#039;s priceless!&nbsp; Attack of the Killer Yuppies! :D

				&nbsp;&gt;:( Warning: Rant!<br /><br />So Co-ops that don&#039;t have slate or tile roofs are okay in the writer&#039;s eyes? Millions? We should be so lucky.<br />Sloppy writing and research. <br />There seems to be a bias against co-ops and &#039;garden apartments&#039; in the writing. Am I paranoid?<br /><br />Most of the neighborhood &#039;yuppies&#039; have turned into &#039;puppies&#039; (parental urban professionals).<br /><br />Again - sloppy.<br /><br />Rant over. :)

				It is strange and disturbing that the JH piece ignored many vital aspects of the community in JH (an area that I am new to and just getting to know).&nbsp; At the same time I was impressed with the article the times ran on Jan 2 about the growing number of homeless people living under Broadway and 69th street.&nbsp; I am glad that they highlighted this crisis in our neighborhood.
