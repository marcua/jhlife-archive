				My husband and I just walked down to take a peek at the damage. We were viewing from 37 and 74. Looks like the fire tore through floors 3 &amp; 4 completely, and partially though floor 2; blinds in the windows on floor 2 at the west corner of the building were intact. However, it did appear that the ceiling of the bodega on the corner of 74 had collapsed - probably due to water damage. And there were still 5 ladders blasting water about an hour ago. So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s looking to good for the restaurants on the first floor, sadly. Hopefully they can guy it out and rebuild quickly, but certainly lots of work to be done.

				Perhaps it&#039;s just because I&#039;ve never been so close to a major fire before, but I was amazed by the quantity of smoke it produced. Hours after the fire was extinguished, the smoke just seemed to get thicker and more noxious. The cops directing traffic on 35th Ave. and 75th St. had to use flashlights so motorists could see them. We live a block from the Bruson Building and finally had to decamp for a motel-- with two little kids, I was worried they were going to start having trouble breathing. I&#039;m so glad nobody was injured in the fire, but the smoke must be harmful for people nearby, especially those with asthma.

				well there&#039;s still smoke because there is still fire (12am).&nbsp; seems like all outward signs of fire are gone, but they&#039;re still spraying the building.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s taking its time burning up as much inside as possible. :(

				Odd how it happened after Plaza College decided to move elsewhere...&nbsp; <br /><br />I got out of the subway, I guess shortly after it started. Looked down 75th and all I saw was flames. It took awhile to figure out where they were coming from. The fire was terrifying and I feel badly that it was still being worked on after midnight. Glad no classes were going on when it happened but it definitely seems suspicious.

				That was some fire!&nbsp; I was being my usual oblivious self on my walk home at 6pm until I happened to look up and saw flames shooting out of the building and fire trucks everywhere.&nbsp; <br />Did anyone else nearby notice the incredibly loud helicopter?&nbsp; It seemed like it was there for hours - at first I thought it was a news chopper but I guess it was a police helicopter since it was there for so long and flying so low.&nbsp; <br />Oh, and my cable and internet went out from it as well.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m glad no one was seriously injured.

				When I walked towards the subway this morning at around 8:30, I was amazed to see that there were still two hoses spraying water on the building. From the various news articles I&#039;ve seen online, it sounds like there are some stubborn hot spots they&#039;re still trying to get under control (or at least were this morning- hopefully it&#039;s better now).<br />Lucky nobody was seriously hurt...

				I think it&#039;s important not to sling criminal accusations around here.<br /><br />The fire on 2/13/2010 at 37th and 84th was investigated and ruled to be an accident.&nbsp; I understand that many people are unhappy with what the property owner built after the fire, but it complied with both the Historic District restrictions and the zoning code, and is very similar to neighboring historic buildings.<br /><br />The 8-story tower between 82nd and 83rd (known as the A&amp;C Palace) replaces some commercial buildings apparently destroyed by arson.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, it was determined to be arson, but nobody was ever charged.&nbsp; Construction on the new building started before the historic district was designated in 1993, but JHBG deserves a lot of credit for pushing the design of this building to look more like the historic district.<br /><br />In the case of the fire at the Bruson building, the FDNY is investigating.&nbsp; I think we should wait for the results.<br /><br />The zoning for this site seems to imply a maximum floor-area ratio of 4.8 if some community functions are included in the building (I think this includes medical offices).&nbsp; This would seem to imply that a new building could be one storey higher than the old one if it uses the same footprint.&nbsp;

				It is unfortunate, but 37th Avenue has had a history of fires that gut entire blocks. I can remember back in maybe 1983 (?) when the whole block btwn 89th and 90th went up in flames. Then in 1987, the block where A&amp;C Plaza is now. Fast forward to 200? when the block btwn 84th and 83rd went up and now the Bruson Bldg. I&#039;m not casting aspersions on anyone here, just lamenting the loss of good mom n&#039; pop type neighborhood businesses which haven&#039;t come back. I would also wager most of the businesses under the Bruson Bldg won&#039;t be back either.

				agreed with all of those points. movie theaters all across the five boroughs are closing up shop, and bookstores? as a writer, the idea just makes me cry.<br />&nbsp;if we&#039;re talking national/regional chains, we could shoot for something in the clothing realm -- there&#039;s already a gap on 82nd, but there has to be something in the mid-price range - or housewares. i don&#039;t think a fast-casual restaurant would work all that well, since it&#039;ll be more expensive than cheap eats options and not as good as the sit-down places a lot of folks are craving. maybe someone could open a nice restaurant, but Jerry Crisci suggested that the landlords were not being terribly tenant friendly in terms of negotiating rents.

				the acceptance on the board of the lowest common denominator is really depressing. it&#039;s also really bad strategy.<br /><br />when you want to effect change or negotiate, you don&#039;t start from &quot;this is OK, this will be barely acceptable&quot;, becuase the other side will just&nbsp; go lower. <br /><br />you need to start from a plausible demand. Like 60% locally owned, non-franchise store per block. Then in negotiation, that comes down. <br /><br />If the community can actually effect pressure; can landmarks, JHBG, danny dromm, city ordinances be put into effect here? Can we talk at all about foot traffic, parking impact, littering, environmental friendliness....perhaps minority/female owned business breaks from the city?<br /><br />How have other neighborhoods that actually give a damn<em> slowed</em> the inevitable chain-ification of their COMMUNAL commercial space. It DOES happen in NYC; particularly in brownstone Brooklyn. Their advice would be welcome.

				there are no city ordinances against fast food, banks, or anything like that. if there were, new york city would still be new york city.<br />&nbsp;<br />i appreciate your idealism, but there&#039;s nothing the &quot;community&quot; can &quot;demand&quot; from a commercial landlord. zip. zilch. nada. i&#039;m not saying that&#039;s right, but i am saying it&#039;s true.<br /><br />this isn&#039;t a new development where the landlord is asking de facto permission to do something. this is a landlord rebuilding and looking to make a killing. that&#039;s the modern world. yeah, it sucks. but you and i don&#039;t have any leverage to tell a building owner what to do with his property - other than, in the historic district, demand a specific color for signage.

				If the space is large and suitable enough, then I think a gym (e.g. a full-featured Crunch/NYSC) wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea. It would satisfy the landlord&#039;s desire for a large chain and the neighborhood&#039;s for a bigger/better gym.<br /><br />We already have McDonald&#039;s, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Wendy&#039;s in the neighborhood. Why do we need another American fast food chain? We have plenty of Mexican, so why a Chipolte? TJMaxx--there&#039;s a Famous Brands on Roosevelt, and I think a TJMaxx or Marshalls on Northern in Woodside. Why another? Trader Joes would be cool, but that location seems impractical (as mentioned, the traffic!). <br /><br />And, please, no Applebees, UNOs, Panera Bread, etc!

Go take a look at the Census and Zillow demographics for Carroll Gardens vs. 11372. They&#039;re very different demographics ... which is part of what I LIKE about Jackson Heights. It just happens that small local &#039;artisanal&#039; businesses can only survive in certain circumstances: (1) they own the building, (2) commercial rents are low (as we see in places like Bed-Stuy) or (3) the neighborhood is absolutely full of rich people. As hfm says, the Indian businesses are supported by the fact that they&#039;re destination shopping, not neighborhood shopping - people come from 50 miles around to go to them, as anyone standing in the middle of 73rd Street gridlock can tell you.

				&nbsp;Also I don&#039;t quite get the anti-TJ sentiment. Is there something about their Business practices that people find objectionable? Or is it because the shopping experience there is awful?

				I&#039;ll reply.&nbsp; It is not Trader Joes per se, although I find nothing interesting personally in there for me to buy.&nbsp; but large chains drive up rent, making it impossible for independent businesses to thrive, let alone open, and to me they homogenize the culture of a neighborhood.&nbsp; They reflect NOTHING of the community they exist in, thus, in my mind, erasing the cultural fabric of a neighborhood.&nbsp; Who owns the store?&nbsp; Where does the profit go?&nbsp; Not to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Does the owner live nearby?&nbsp; People ask for an independent restaurant, a bar.&nbsp; can&#039;t happen, because the rents are already too high.&nbsp; I know three people personally who looked into opening a new spot (2 restaurants, one a small bar) in the area, and the numbers just didn&#039;t make sense.&nbsp; Only a large corporation can afford the rents.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look at 6th avenue and the 20&#039;s or the west village in manhattan.&nbsp; Are these &quot;interesting neighborhoods&quot; now?&nbsp; look at Williamsburg and what it is becoming.&nbsp; You said yourself there are already several Trader Joes in the city.&nbsp; by all means patronize them, but I am always surprised about how many people willingly move into a neighborhood and then want to cherry pick their favorite stores of which there are myriad elsewhere, and plonk them down a half block from their house.&nbsp; There is tremendous food shopping here, and in Astoria.&nbsp; Bad vegetables?&nbsp; There are several greenmarkets on 37th that are good, plus the farmer&#039;s market every sunday.&nbsp; and amazing 24 hour vegetable shops in Astoria as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why on earth move to Jackson heights if you prefer a Trader Joes?&nbsp; I know the answer is economics pure and simple. But it is disheartening to watch as the cultural fabric of the city changes into a shopping mall of the same seven stores.&nbsp; Give me Patel Brothers and Subzi mandi any day.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I moved here.&nbsp; BUT I am guessing those who want the chains will get them, because the economics, and the culture are pointing that way.<br /><br />I&#039;ll apologize in advance for rubbing anybody the wrong way.&nbsp;

				in defending the long island-ization of williamsburg and the desire to repeat that here, people often say &#039;new york has always been about change.&#039; that&#039;s fair enough, but for hundreds of years, neighborhoods actually changed, they didn&#039;t get stepford-ized. the LES went from German to Jewish to Puerto Rican; Five Points went from Irish to Chinese; Sunset Park from Scandinavian to Latin. Nowadays, every neighborhood is required to become the mirror image of every other neighborhood -- four starbucks, two chain bagel places, a buy buy baby, a couple of upscale produce stands that put up fancy displays to triple prices.....there&#039;s no discernible difference between williamsburg, the upper west side, the west village, long island city.....it&#039;s one monolithic, monochromatic slag.<br /><br />anything i can do to keep that from happening here, i&#039;ll do. it&#039;s why i don&#039;t go to duane reade unless absolutely necessary. why i&#039;ve never set foot in the starbucks on 37th (or any starbucks anywhere, for that matter). everyone&#039;s entitled to vote with their dollars, and i vote to use mine with the llittle guy.

And even in Astoria, actual large-chain _grocery stores_ - like the Costco - insist upon parking.<br /><br />That&#039;s because - outside of Manhattan and Brooklyn - these kinds of retailers do not think of themselves as neighborhood stores; they think of themselves as having a multi-neighborhood catchment area, and many of the neighborhoods in their catchment area tend to be car neighborhoods. If you want a store that really serves the neighborhood within walking distance, you&#039;ll have to look beyond these national chains and their planning policies and to a real, local business that has an interest in the local population. Or, if you want a chain, you&#039;ll have to look at sit-in dining rather than shopping.

				If a small independent place can&#039;t make it due to the rents, perhaps maybe something like a Heartland Brewery that has a bar and halfway decent burgers. Something that won&#039;t compete with places like Juju&#039;s and E77.<br /><br />Speaking of.. those guys have seemed to find a way to make it, but then again those places are small.

				I would welcome a Trader Joe&#039;s. Part of the issue with the one in Queens is that it shares space with a large Michael&#039;s and a furniture store, so that&#039;s a lot of shopping that may not have anything to do with TJ. I would also welcome it because Downtown Market is only at one end of the area; is far more expensive than TJ; and TJ offers options not available at any food store in the area, such as certified humanely raised meats. Foodtown only sells chicken that&#039;s certified. I moved here from Chicago about 18 months ago, and a TJ that moved into a super-busy area bought the whole building, creating a parking lot on the upper floors. That meant street parking wasn&#039;t made worse when they moved in. I would rather not have fast food places like McD&#039;s because of the smell. There&#039;d be no way for people who live nearby (and I&#039;d be one of them) to get away from that fryer smell. (At least Chipotle&#039;s can&#039;t be smelled a half-block away.) If someone wants a good burger, Ricky&#039;s Cafe makes good ones, and a local shop might be hurt by a national fast food chain. I would vote for nearly anything that wouldn&#039;t hurt the small neighborhood restaurants, which give JH such a neighborhood feel. Just my 2 cents.

				Weighing in belatedly.<br /><br />It strikes me that one thread that undertows this discussion is that the existing supermarkets, though numerous, are inadequate in terms of service, and selection and quality of goods they offer. The green market and Lemon Farm are terrific,&nbsp; as are some of the small places we haveand I appreciate Metfoods&#039; efforts, but there is definitely room for improvement in the supermarket scape. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks all for coming together to influence what the Bruson Building owners (in this case Mr. Craig Bruno) will do with the renovated spaces on 37th Ave off 75th St.&nbsp; There are various opportunities here and I&#039;m glad we&#039;re exploring all avenues possible.&nbsp; We definitely don&#039;t need another McDonald&#039;s or Burger King in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I wish it could be as it was, with La Portena restaurant and Armando&#039;s Italian (I know they&#039;re moving to Northern Blvd) and Frank&#039;s (I know they&#039;re on 77th now)&nbsp; but I suppose they had to move on with their businesses after the fire.&nbsp; <br /><br />As I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll all agree, we need healthy food options, and spaces for families with children.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think opening a &quot;fast food&quot; franchise enhances our community. Some might say, well these are affordable restaurants, but so is say -- Pollos a la Brasa, or Tomo Japanese, or Arunee -- and at least these are far more unique, and offer an arguably friendlier atmosphere.&nbsp; <br /><br />There has been talk of possibly luring a franchise like Panera, and also backlash against that idea, and I&#039;d chime in that the one thing that is wonderful about Panera is they encourage community groups to come together in their coffee shops.&nbsp; They welcome clubs, support groups, even knitting circles (and aren&#039;t going to throw you to the curb as some places tend to do if you don&#039;t &quot;buy&quot; enough).&nbsp; <br /><br />Another franchise that is growing, that offers eco-conscious organic food options is Bareburger.&nbsp; (Any entrepreneurs on this forum who want to look into opening one up?)<br /><br />And just to chime in on Trader Joe&#039;s, I agree with many that it could be a delightful addition, since they offer creative &quot;no-frills&quot; items (&amp; really I know of no shop really like it around here)...I would just share that a couple of years ago I got a bunch of my neighborhood friends to write to TJ&#039;s to ask them to look into the empty Mandee&#039;s shop by Blockbuster (now thankfully occupied by Garden School UPK) TJs sent automatic responses that they&#039;d look into it -- and there would have been parking &quot;built in&quot; at that spot -- but they did not end up coming through obviously.&nbsp; At the time I also called the owners of that block of stores, and he let me know the exorbitant amount he was asking for per month...I said it&#039;d be great to have a studio there for kids&#039; workshops, or perhaps to bring in a Trader Joe&#039;s to compliment the greenmarket, and he just said he &quot;didn&#039;t think we needed another supermarket&quot;.&nbsp; As if we needed another car parts store!!]&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve also seen Whole Foods talked about on the local forums, and yes they offer a plethora of earth-friendly and unique options, but I believe they look for very affluent areas to settle in, so they may not look here... Luckily, we have the mom &amp; pop shop &quot;Downtown Market&quot; on 84th St that offers a lot of the same items. <br /><br />A couple of people along the way have mentioned book stores, which in essence are fantastic, though I know it can be hard to make a profit because of internet competition... I would be thrilled if the city would support the opening of a new Queens Library branch.&nbsp; I know that libraries are non-profit, so perhaps that also wouldn&#039;t bring in the kind of $$ the building owners are looking for... (But if it is funded by the city, doesn&#039;t that mean it is steady revenue?)&nbsp; I like to imagine a space to compliment the one on 81st, with space for interesting workshops, and all the learning opportunities a library offers for everyone.&nbsp; (Again I look at the library expansion happening right now in Long Island City with the branch in the Citibank building.&nbsp; It started out small, but they want to accommodate the need in the area, which is a need we also have)<br /><br />Several folks have also declared that we could use a bigger gym in our area...I completely agree, because it would be great to finally have a gym again that offered CLASSES!&nbsp; It&#039;s obvious that our residents like to come together to do group aerobic exercise (as seen by posts on various forums) and basically we are currently using borrowed spaces at neighborhood schools (or going outdoors - which is fine - but during WARM weather)&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, as could also be considered recently purchased White Castle corporate space on 69th St, we need more child-friendly spaces.&nbsp; NY Kids Club in LIC for example is a nice open room where kids can safely climb and move indoors, and there are ramps for strollers, which is really lacking right now our area.&nbsp; We have such great classes for young kids in Jackson Heights, but again right now they are generally held in spaces with no elevators, which make it extremely difficult for caretakers to safely bring their babies upstairs.&nbsp; <br /><br />It sounds like the &quot;new&quot; storefronts and offices at Bruson would be spacious, and could accommodate options like these, if the owner would open his mind to the possibilities.<br />

				thank goodness there&#039;ll be a bank. it&#039;s a good 100 feet to the TD from there.<br /><br />but &#039;green grocer&#039; is an interesting term. it will probably have to be a chain store to afford a big chunk at what&#039;s sure to be a high price. maybe Amish Market?

				Huh, a green grocer could be great depending on if it&#039;s just another clone of Lemon Farms and the like.&nbsp; But that&#039;s a pretty big space so I&#039;m crossing my fingers that it might have a good variety of stuff.&nbsp; I guess if it&#039;s a true green grocer it won&#039;t have meat and dry goods.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yet another bank.

The Trust wants $95/sq ft for the corners and $85 otherwise.

Otherwise, $170,000. Plus insurance, taxes, etc. A friend costed out 2,000 sq ft at one of the corners, and it worked out to something like $18,000 per month. Plus, almost certainly, an annual 3% increase (compounded, of course), which currently exceeds inflation.

				This is my block. While I would LOVE to have a Fairway, Trader Joe&#039;s, etc. so close to my apartment, I wonder what, if any, community input or traffic study was done before deciding to open a large chain grocery store there. (I know that there was a hearing/meeting about this a while back, but I don&#039;t remember this being floated as a prospective tenant.) Traffic is horrible with all of the double-parking happening on 37th Ave (not to mention the blocked traffic from<del> Trade Fair</del> Global Supermarket&#039;s delivery trucks). Cars honk incessantly on 75th/37th. Parking is horrible and it was bad even before we lost a block and a half due to construction. I don&#039;t even want to think about what the traffic &amp; parking situation will be like when this new store opens up. From what I&#039;ve seen so far, it doesn&#039;t look as if an underground garage is in the works.<br /><br />I know that I&#039;m literally shouting NOT IN MY BACKYARD! But I really don&#039;t think that the immediately surrounding area can handle the traffic influx that will come with this type of store.

				The DNAinfo article&#039;s mention of a green grocer brought to mind something I heard a few weeks ago, and that&#039;s that one of the local markets, Patel Brothers, Apna Bazar, or Subzi Mandi were looking to relocate.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t substantiated, but from what I heard, one of the three had expressed interest in occupying the Global Supermarket space.&nbsp; With the mention of a known establishment, I wonder if it may be one of the markets interested in opening at the Bruson.&nbsp; Food for thought.

				If it&#039;s something that&#039;s already in the neighborhood and just looking to relocate that&#039;s one thing. But if it&#039;s yet ANOTHER grocery store...I don&#039;t know, I think we have enough already (although having a TJ&#039;s or Fairway would be nice!). And another bank! Ugh!

				I disagree about Jackson Heights not having the &quot;right&quot; demographics for a Fairway.&nbsp; I think Jackson Heights is the perfect place for a new one.&nbsp; The prices at Fairway are competitive and often better than Foodtown or the other options in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Fairway has locations in lots of different areas and has been expanding rapidly in the last few years.&nbsp; Also, I don&#039;t think the mention of the grocery store taking the same corner as Armondo&#039;s means that the new store will occupy the same exact footprint.&nbsp; There is certainly space in that building for a large grocery store.&nbsp; Obviously this store could be anything people have mentioned but I think Jackson Heights underestimates it&#039;s appeal to quality brands, especially a local business like Fairway. Blink Fitness and the new Gap store on 82nd Street are good examples of companies moving into the area.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The Fairway locations are all in higher-income areas except for two rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods: Red Hook and Harlem. I&#039;d kill to have Fairway here, but it ain&#039;t gonna happen any time soon. It&#039;s a pipe dream.<br /><br />Regarding the places you mentioned: The Gap Store is an outlet; we wouldn&#039;t be able to get a regular gap here. Blink Fitness is a discount gym. We couldn&#039;t get NYSC to come here; people tried. <br /><br />It&#039;s not about residents underestimating the appeal; it&#039;s about numbers and outrageously high commercial rents in JH compared to other neighborhoods.

				the one thing that completely nixes the fairway idea is the size of the space. the smallest fairway location is far bigger than the foodtown, which is far bigger than the space being discussed here. <br /><br />the red hook one is 55,000 square feet, the new downtown/WTC area one is 50,000. it&#039;d be like suggesting a shake shack move in to the (now seemingly closed) subway next to Ricky&#039;s.....

				I hope it&#039;s not another Patels or a &quot;destination store&quot; that people travel to from outside the neighborhood. That really would add to the existing chronic traffic nightmare.&nbsp; I have always thought that Jackson Heights would benefit from municipal parking. Maybe under the BQE somewhere.

				An excellent piece just came out from the New Yorker magazine about how high commercial rents are negatively affecting wonderful neighborhoods throughout NYC, including the West Village. It also features some solutions for this issue, including this blurb:<br />&gt; If high-rent blight hurts New York’s municipal economy, what, if anything, might be done? Because the problem is tied almost inextricably to the value of New York real estate generally, there are no simple fixes. The #SaveNYC movement and the Small Business Congress NYC advocate the regulation of lease renewal. They support a bill written by the small-business advocate Steve Null that tries to limit rent spikes by making commercial-lease-renewal disputes subject to mandatory mediation and arbitration, like some baseball salaries. Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, supports a different regulation of lease renewals, coupled with zoning rules, that encourages landlords to quit waiting for the jackpot and to start renting. Some, like Moss, want to fine landlords who leave storefronts abandoned, in the hope that they’ll then rent to smaller, quirkier companies instead of Chipotle. There may also be other original solutions to the specific problem of high-rent blight, such as, perhaps, finding ways to let pop-up stores use abandoned spaces on a seasonal basis. &lt;<br /><br />http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-are-there-so-many-shuttered-storefronts-in-the-west-village?mbid=rss<br />

But as mentioned, I&#039;ve been told commercial space rent isn&#039;t much different than Manhattan rents. What gives? That&#039;s just nuts.
