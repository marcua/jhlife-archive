We ask that if you have not signed the online version yet, please do so today:</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://www.qns.bike/petition" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qns.bike/petition</a><br /><br /><strong>If you&#039;re not familiar with our initiative </strong><br />We are a group of more than 30 people living anywhere from Astoria to Flushing, but most in Jackson Heights. In 2015 we started&nbsp; a campaign here on this forum to ask the city to build a bike lane grid connecting parks in our area, from Astoria do Flushing Meadows Corona Park.<br /><br />We did nearly 20 group bike rides to promote healthy cycling and the diversity, culture, businesses and food in our area. During the process, we collected more than 3,300 signatures for a petition asking the city build the bike lane grid that we want.<br /><br /><strong>Updates on the campaign</strong><br />We&#039;ve had overwhelmingly positive feedback, learned from our neighbors and made new friends. We also had a few great successes, like a bike lane on 31st avenue that connects Jackson Heights the water front parks in Astoria and Flushing promenade. <br /><br /><img src="https://scontent.fphl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14479532_1132698846806772_5311561769096677981_n.png?oh=4d836cdb43cdd110d0cfa3a7e244eba0&amp;oe=5A5067B3" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />But there&#039;s still a lot to be done before we can get a bike network that that can get people of all ages safely to a park. Our goal is to have a grid that would allow anyone between the ages 8 and 88 to safely bike from Flushing Meadows Corona Park to Astoria, connecting the neighborhoods in between. This is even more urgent considering that Travers Park is scheduled to close for renovation soon.<br /><br />Recently NYC selected our area, Community Board 3, to be one of the priority zones for the implementation of a safer bike infrastructure. Data showed that cyclists are already riding here and that streets needed to become safer. It also showed that areas like East Elmhurst and Northern Corona would benefit from another transportation alternative, since they are far from the subway. In the coming months, the city will organize workshops to make a grid that serves all here.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to join us</strong><br />Email <a href="mailto:qnsbike@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">qnsbike@gmail.com</a>, we have a list serve that we use to talk and organize rides. Many of our rides are kid friendly. Including two upcoming rides in Halloween and Christmas.<br /><br /><strong>We want to take the chance to thank all our neighbors for their support.</strong><br />Thanks also to all the businesses that received us on our food rides and that hosted our petitions, like Table Wine, Cannelle Patisserie, Aroma Brazil, Arepa Lady and many others. Also thanks to our friends and neighbors from Jackson Heights Beautification Group,&nbsp; Jackson Heights Green Alliance, East Elmhurst Historical Society, Louis Armstrong Museum, Queens Museum and Make Queens Safer. To council members Daniel Dromm, Costa Constantinides and Julissa Ferreras for their continuous support. <br /><br /><strong>Finally, thanks to NYPD for helping us on our Santa Ride! There’s one more coming up on Dec. 3! Save the date, bring your kids! </strong><br /><br />Visit us on facebook.com/qnsbike<br /><br />Our vision for our area is a protected bike/pedestrian loop connecting the parks in Jackson Heights, East Elmurst and Corona.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.sergiopecanha.com/jh/jhbike1100.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br /><strong>THANK YOU!</strong><br /></span>

This bike lane was installed in September and connects Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst to Socrates Park and to the Corona Promenade. Although it&#039;s not perfect and not suitable for children or inexperienced riders, it&#039;s a step in the right direction. It&#039;s also the result of the work of a group that came together right here on the JH Life forum.<br /><br />So join us so you can try it out for yourself!<br /><br /><strong>Route</strong><br />This ride will start at Travers Park on 78th Street in Jackson Heights and primarily travel along the new bike lane, a direct result of the community asking for more bike-friendly roads in Queens.<br /><br />We will ride near Astoria Park, and visit some areas where there is still work to do for better bike access. Finally, for those that are interested, we will end our ride with brunch at La Gloria and have a brief meeting to talk about future plans for the accomplishments of the Queens Bike Initiative. All are welcome, and your RSVP is appreciated to make a reservation at the restaurant.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.qns.bike/img/sept_parkride_1000x1000.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Illustration by Daniel Fishel/O-fishel.com<br /><br />ps.

NYC DOT has unveiled a plan last week for a bike lane on 31st Avenue, from Socrates Park to Jackson Heights, to eventually reach Flushing Promenade. This is the very first and essential step to reach our dreamed network of bike lanes connecting parks in Queens.<br /><br />See maps and plan details at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/qnsbike" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/qnsbike</a><br /><br />This bike lane will increase park access and life quality to 500,000 people living in Astoria, East Elmhurst, Ditmars, Jackson Heights and Corona. It will serve as a transportation alternative in areas underserved by the subway. It will improve access to business centers in a low cost green way. It will calm traffic and increase safety. And, look at this: <strong>no lane or parking loss</strong>.<br /><br />We want to say THANK YOU to our community who has been showing incredible support for this initiative. More than 2,600 neighbors have signed our petition! We&#039;ll keep collecting signatures as the weather warms up, promoting rides and events.<br /><br /><strong>THANK YOU!!!</strong><br /><br /></span>

It will be a Santa-inspired ride, focused on families and children. The Santa Bike ride will be an easy ride of about 3 miles through Jackson Heights and Corona. We invite everyone one to dress up your Christmas outfit, because <strong>Santa Claus himself will be a special guest in our ride</strong>.<br /><br />We will have a stop at Junction playground (94th street &amp; 34th Ave) for kids to burn some energy, and final destination the Queens Museum. There will be police escort along the way, so it&#039;s absolutely safe.<br /><br />Around 11:15, when we get to the Museum, we will have a grand finale with <strong>Story Garden with Miss Alexia</strong> playing Christmas tunes and other songs for kids.<br /><br />In addition, the museum is offering that afternoon a variety of fun <strong>hands-on art making activities for children</strong> 5-12 and their adult companions, from 1:30pm to 4:30 pm. This is being organized by the museum, unrelated to the bike ride, but coupling nicely. More information here.<br /><br />Folks should arrange their own travel back from Queens Museum and bring locks for their bikes. <br /><br />This ride is part of our campaign for bike lanes connecting parks in Queens.

We will ride to Long Island City via Sunnyside. It is an easy ride, with bike lanes almost the whole way. Of course we will include a few good places to eat along the way, because we feel hungry when we bike! Please sign up on our Facebook page if you’d like to come:<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/532213786928968/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/532213786928968/</a><br /><br />We encourage people who would like to ride in the city but are afraid to do it on their own to join us. While we ride at our own risk, the group has some experienced riders who can give you tips and moral support.<br /><br /><strong>Update to our petition numbers</strong><br />We have collected about 1,950 signatures so far, 670 online and difference on paper. A very significant share of signatures collected comes from zip code 11372. This shows the massive support of many people from Jackson Heights — notably on this board where it all started. Your support gives us motivation to keep going.<br /><br /><strong>THANKS SO MUCH! </strong><br /><br />Please keep sharing the online petition:<br /><a href="http://www.qns.bike/petition" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.qns.bike/petition</a><br /><br />If you haven’t signed the paper version yet, please stop by at the Arepa Lady or Table Wine (congrats for the best neighbors awards!
