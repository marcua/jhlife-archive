				Attached is the floor plan of another unit in this some building, also in the G line. It doesn&#039;t look like 1400 sq ft. There&#039;s no dining room or even a foyer that might be used as a dining room. Maybe the one for sale is combined units?

				Well, from the photos it does not look remotely like an apartment that would be priced that high. Two beds/two baths--competing listings at that price are gorgeously renovated--the brief description says something vague about marble and new appliances, but the photos make it look like an estate sale. I had to laugh when I saw the pix paired with that price.

				No doubt it&#039;s aggressively priced given the condition. It&#039;s likely to sell in the mid-800s. It&#039;s a fixer-upper for sure. I noticed they appear to have done a nice job on the floors, except for the room with the red carpet. Which raises the question of what&#039;s under that carpet? A stained or damaged floor that needs extensive repair? No pictures of the bathroom is a sure sign of old bath needing renovation.<br /><br />I wonder if the high price and the lack of enticing pictures has anything to do with the realtor. I don&#039;t recognize their name and their listings are a hodgepodge of commercial and residential.<br /><br />See: http://www.vlshomes.com/brokers/ECR/homepage.htm?list_class=ALL&amp;for_sale=1&amp;town=Jackson%20Heights (http://www.vlshomes.com/brokers/ECR/homepage.htm?list_class=ALL&amp;for_sale=1&amp;town=Jackson%20Heights)<br />

				Hmmm.. interesting about the one that sold for $675 in 2015. It just seems like a really high price in a building that does not, as far as I know, have a garden, or any other special amenities, and the apartments themselves, judging by these two listings, are nothing special at all. I&#039;ve seen so much more beautiful apartments and buildings at that price point in JH. I guess it&#039;s true that there are few condo&#039;s in this neighborhood, and there is demand for condos, so I guess that makes the prices higher? I just don&#039;t see it as a potential buyer--for a fixer-upper in JH this seems like a very high price.

				That&#039;s weird - I just tried to look up the sale of 4G on ACRIS but it comes up blank. Maybe I looked it up wrong. Streeteasy has to get their data from somewhere, and I assumed it would be ACRIS.

				Wow--I looked at that sale from a year ago, and I am still amazed they are getting those prices. That one had just one bath, the second bedroom looks minuscule, and the building has a view of another complex&#039;s garden, not its own garden. Yes, the carrying costs are pretty low--but ours are lower, in a coop, and we have two bathrooms, a larger second bedroom than that apartment, and in a complex with its own block-long garden. I just don&#039;t get it.

				I have timed the &quot;F&quot; train ride from Roosevelt Avenue to Times Square (6th Avenue) at 16 minutes.&nbsp; That does not include walking to the train, waiting for the train, walking to your final destination or any train delays or slow downs.&nbsp; Real-time commute to midtown generally runs 35-40 minutes on average.&nbsp; But wouldn&#039;t a 15-minute commute be heaven?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I don&#039;t think anyone interprets that &quot;15 minutes to midtown&quot; claim as door-to-door commuting time. Everyone assumes it means the time you spend on the train, not getting to the station or getting from the train to your office. I think it&#039;s true that both on the F and E you can get to midtown in about 15 minutes if the train is running well. I take the F to Bryant Park and 42nd every day, and that&#039;s pretty accurate unless there are delays. My husband used to take the E to 5th and 53rd at it was also about 15 minutes. Our walk to those trains is about 7 minutes, so we do have commuting times that are quite good.

				^the only people who would think &quot;15 minutes to midtown&quot; means door-to-door would be newbies to the city. And that notion gets quickly dispelled by just going to look at an apartment. <br /><br />

				According to the MTA (i.e., best case scenario!) <br />the 7 takes 27 minutes to go from 74th to TS. <br />The F takes 17+3 minute walk = 20 minutes<br />The R takes 23 minutes<br /><br />And that is from station platform to station platform, on the train.<br />

				Already reduced to $886K as of today. Someone likely explained that the over $900K price point meant a lot of people weren&#039;t even seeing the listing.

				am315.&nbsp; I agree with you that the price is still too high.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible that they&#039;re just testing the market and are in no hurry to sell.&nbsp; So they are willing to wait until the market reaches their price.&nbsp; I plan to list my 900SF<br />Prewar Garden View apartment in October.&nbsp; I plan on moving to a rental so I won&#039;t be in a hurry to sell.&nbsp;
