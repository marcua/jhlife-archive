				The Brigands (pronounced BrigANDS) was Jackson Heights&#039; very own gang of juvenile delinquents circa 1953.&nbsp; They were closer to the kids in Grease rather than skinheads. . . and, yes, they hung out in the P.S. 69 schoolyard at all hours when school was out.&nbsp; I think they were more benign than malignant, but I always gave them a wide birth.&nbsp; Their jackets were very cool -- black with &quot;Brigands&quot; on the back in fifties hot<br />pink. Anybody remember this group?

				ahh, well before my time then. I guess I was witness to the less stellar and more annoying &quot;gang&quot; that hovered around the school yard.

				From what I hear, all sorts of things used to go on behind that school.&nbsp; When did they put up that fence?&nbsp; Seems too bad because that is some nice, scarce, public open space in that part of the neighborhood.

				The fences got put up somewhere in the mid to late 80&#039;s after a car careened into the school yard hitting a child one day. <br /><br />The rest of the free space was filled in with the building expansion and temporary school buildings which seem rather permanent to me.

				Sure, I remember them. I punched one of them out in the PS 69 yard after they tried to take my stickball bat. Basically cowards--all they could do after the punch-out was to spit at me through the fence. But a couple of days later they found me during school hours in the JHS 145 playground and tried to beat me up, with limited success. The leader, Dick something, and his parents were brought in to the school. <br /><br />They pretty much left me alone after that. I think the principal was Moses M. Nagelberg--this would have been in the early fifties.

				The original leader was a guy named Donny, and good for you for standing up to the Brigands.&nbsp; Back in the 50s, &quot;rocks&quot; dressed the part: Engineer boots, dungarees with wide cuffs(we didn&#039;t call them &quot;jeans&quot;), garrison belts with buckles worn to the sides, muscle man T-shirts, and motorcycle jackets (if you could afford one).&nbsp; Wrist watches, if worn, were worn below the wrist, presumably to avoid breakage during fights. Collars were flipped up and sleeves rolled up.&nbsp; Some fashion plates wore color coordinated rabbit&#039;s feet to go with the lettering on their flashy gang jackets. With their fancy hairdos and cool clothes, the &quot;rocks&quot; looked a lot more dramatic then we straight kids with our chinos, nondescript T-shirts, and Keds. But heck, we stayed out of the Principal&#039;s office. . .and had a lot fewer black eyes.&nbsp;
