					Yes, for anyone who is not all that familiar with posting for Garage Sales on CL; this is a time-consuming and quite difficult proposition; a person needs at least a Master&#039;s Degree, in order to figure out the schematics of all of this; getting into the correct area, in order to have the posting appear in the right section can be somehow frustrating and&nbsp; crazy, but now, I have figured this out; no problem for me at all. So, I wonder if you and I already know each other??? Maybe you have bought from me at a Flea Market, somewhere along the line??? Or, you are a vendor and this is how we know each other??? At any rate, tomorrow, Saturday, October 4th, does not look to be a dry day, I am sure but hopefully, Sunday will be lovely. Meantime, please let us all pray for a glorious Saturday for October 11th (Pumpkin Festival/Street Fair/Antique Market at All Saints&#039; Church, Sunnyside, Queens; ditto for October 25th, 2014; re-do date for SMC.

					I just received your kind note, re: my posting about the rescheduled date. Better safe than sorry, I always say; good to have more than one listing about the new date. I have additionally posted the October 25th date on Craig&#039;s List; Garage Sales section. You can see there. Merci encore. Yes, please stop by to my booth space and say hi to me on October 25th.

					To the person who wrote about my most recent Jackson Heights Life Posting (above); making mention of the fact that my use of all Capital Letters is confusing to readers. While this is an excellent point; appreciated and well taken by me, I just want to state to the person who wrote this note, that I always use Upper Case letters, in order to have all of my Postings (Flea Markets, et al), stand out from all of the other Listing; make my Postings easier to read for everyone, but I guess that for this particular person, this is simply not the case. So, keeping all of this in mind, and going forward, I will write my Postings in a variety of Upper and Lower case letters; see how this goes. Merci Encore. Adrienne
