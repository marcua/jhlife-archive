					I&nbsp; already have my answer to that question since i moved to Bayside about five years ago.&nbsp; For me it was a hard decision since I lived in Jackson Heights or the immediate area since the 1970&#039;s.&nbsp; Why did I decide to move?&nbsp; The need for two cars to get to work.&nbsp; Back in the&nbsp; 1980&#039;s neither one of us had a car and we both worked in Manhattan or near JH&nbsp; so it made the decision easy because the area has such great public transportation.&nbsp; We eventually got one car in the 1990&#039;s because we wanted to do day trips on the weekend and going to the beach on public transportation was a long day&nbsp; and a hassle.&nbsp; In 2008 we needed a second car because&nbsp; one of us&nbsp; was working in Eastern Queens and the other in Western&nbsp; Nassau and it was just too hard to get to work with public transportation.&nbsp; After two years of battling the parking we decided to buy a house in Bayside.&nbsp; If we could have rented garages for both cars (even at a high cost) we would have stayed in JH but finding garages close enough to our apartment were elusive.<br /><br />How did things work out?&nbsp; We definitely miss the conveniences of JH and the&nbsp; wide variety of eateries and the ease of getting into the city on weekends and just strolling on 37th avenue.&nbsp; But we found out there were a number of things we didn&#039;t miss at all.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t miss the honking of car horns at all hours, searching for parking, having friends who&nbsp; lived outside the city and needed to visit us by car not come because they couldn&#039;t find parking or not knowing if your new neighbors would be stomping around at all hours of the night or playing loud music.&nbsp; Here are some of the things we love about Bayside.&nbsp; We have a driveway and a garage&nbsp; and aside from not needing to look for parking it is nice when you come home from&nbsp; shopping that&nbsp; you can walk five feet to your door and unload or you can come home late at night and not feel uneasy walking home.&nbsp; We have space for everything since there are only two of us since we don&#039;t have children.&nbsp; We have a backyard where we grow tomatoes, cucumbers and other things and we can BBQ and entertain outside.&nbsp; We are less then 10 minute walks&nbsp; to Little Bay Park and Fort Totten.&nbsp; We are also close to the Bay Terrace Shopping center which has some nice stores and the main drag on Bell Blvd has a number of pubs and places to have&nbsp; drinks and a burger and the stores are getting more diverse each year.&nbsp; The dining is surprisingly good with many Greek, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean eateries.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; Colombian, Peruvian and Mexican restaurant too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong it is not like JH for eating but&nbsp; it has&nbsp; a pretty good selection.<br /><br />What do I do when we miss JH?&nbsp; We take a 20 minute drive and spend a few hours in JH and eat there.&nbsp; I will always love the Heights but&nbsp; I feel living in Bayside and being able to visit JH so easily is the best of both worlds.&nbsp; I would love to hear where others would want to live or if they already left JH where would they go.&nbsp; I am also aware for some people&nbsp; there is no other place they would want to live and plan on staying in JH for a log time.

					My friend&#039;s son is graduating from college this June and they currently live in the Philadelphia suburbs.&nbsp; Their son would like to live in western Queens JH, Astoria Sunnyside etc..&nbsp; He has an offer at a NYC accounting firm at 65K per year but he also has an offer in the Philly area for 58K per year.&nbsp; My friend asked me if you can live on 65K in this area if you want to live on your own and not share an apartment. Since I am well established and no longer live in JH I&#039;m not sure I can offer any solid guidance.&nbsp; Is it possible to rent your own apartment and live on 65K per year in JH or is that a stretch.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.

					I am looking for a storage unit in Queens preferably in the Maspeth, LIC or College Point area.&nbsp; I am guessing I need a 10/12 space.&nbsp; Do any places have the prices online?&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find an approximate price online.&nbsp; I would consider&nbsp; splitting the storage into two places one in Queens and one outside of the city.&nbsp; I can&#039;t seem to find any places online&nbsp; that have the pricing does anyone know the approximate prices of these places?

					I would like to here some suggestions for day trips from JH to places approximately&nbsp; 2 hours away or less. Somebody mentioned Rhinebeck to me and I went about 15 years ago and I thought it was really nice and might be willing to go again but I would like to hear what people have to say.&nbsp; Somebody also mentioned that Beacon NY&nbsp; has transformed itself and I would consider going there but&nbsp; I want to know more.&nbsp; I can recommend Mystic Seaport in CT and and Essex, CT if anyone wants to go there -&nbsp; two great day trips.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any recommendations.
