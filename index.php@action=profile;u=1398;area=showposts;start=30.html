There is a big difference between an ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, and a LEGAL IMMIGRANT. A legal immigrant comes through the big door, and they go through the process, they enter the country abiding by the law. There are thousands of people in every country waiting for a visa for as long as 10 years, in the mean time millions cross the border illegally, and demand amnesty, while the others wait.&quot;YOU WANT TO SEE THE PRICES OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING RISE? Are vegetables and fruit any cheaper because illegal pick them up? I don&#039;t think so, they are very expensive, I don&#039;t get any benefit from that, the ones that benefits is the farmer, not the consumers, in the mean time each one of those illegal come here with many children, and once they are here they have more babies, that is the tool for them to start milking off the system.

Instead of hanging the wash cloth in the windows to dry, there are dryers, but if no one tells those people anything, they keep doing the same they did in their countries, they live their lives the same way, and if I happen to live in that neighborhood where they come to live, I don&#039;t like that, because the way I know is different.

					<strong>APG7714 Believe, I don&#039;t mean to offend you, or anyone else, I am just venting out my point of view, and my point of view is that I am sad that it happened.

I don&#039;t mean to put you down because you live there, the problem is that you don&#039;t understand what I mean. There was another beautiful area to live, and that was Washington Heights, are you aware of what happened to that area? I think that is a shame.And yes, you have a point, not all areas in Manhattan are good, but for the most part, living there, and living in JH is like me driving a Mercedez and you driving a pick-up truck. Still there are very exclusive sections. But why pay millions to live there when you could live in beautiful JH? But anyway, if you get offended, there is no use to talk. I thought problems can be corrected by talking, by seeing, and accepting the cons-and pros. You might live there, but it is not your property, so why get so offended?</strong>

					<strong>Hey, don&#039;t get me wrong, my point is that JH was a beautiful neighborhood, to me it was a Manhattan suburb, and it is not like that anymore, and it is too late to fix it, I would say impossible. I believe in keeping things nice, not destroy them. Tell me, is it American to sit at the door of a restaurant to call out loud the menue?

It is a celebratory title that honors the cultural wealth that Queens has to offer. Nowhere else in the world can you experience so much art, music, cuisine and culture in such a relatively small area and all for the cost of a Metrocard.&nbsp; <br /><br />Immigrant is not a dirty word, last I checked the vast majority of people living in the country can trace their roots to immigration at one time or another. I agree that a community such as ours has specific challenges that do relate to immigration (both legal and illegal). Those challenges are best met through social services and education rather than finger pointing and blame. The thought that &quot;immigrants&quot; came here and &quot;distroyed&quot; our community is ludicrous. While 49 % of queens is Foreign born, that leaves 51% at least 1st generation Americans, are we saying that 49% of our population is responsible for 100% of our problems ?&nbsp; There&#039;s little to no logic in that argument. <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh really? how come this train was not called like that before? Immigrants have been coming to this country since the country was founded? If this is an honor to the &quot;immigrants&quot; how come all those immigrants who have been coming here for many years LEGALLY, including myself,&nbsp; have been ignored? What is wrong? Do we have to brake the law to be honored? And who is saying that &quot;immigrant&quot;

To tell you the truth, I&nbsp; did not go around 35th Ave.&nbsp; I only went as far as 37th. Ave. When I lived there I didn&#039;t have a car. I used to work in Manhattan, and I lived on 72nd. St. Between 41st. Avenue, and Woodside. I used to walk to 82nd. St. and shop at Fields, and the Boutiques on 82nd. And I used to walk to the train a couple of blocks to go to work. This is all I know about JH. And I used to go to the restaurants on Roosevelt Ave. and 82nd.St. I used to love that neighborhood, to me, working in Manhattan all week long, going there after a day&#039;s work, and on week-ends, it was like going to a suburb. but we noticed that the neighborhood started to change, and got out. 35th. Ave is already far away from the trains isn&#039;t it? What kind of public transportation do you have there? Honestly, I have been keeping an eye on the neighborhood hoping it will change. The problem right now is that I will be afraid to take the trains, or walk by myself on the streets. I wouldn&#039;t feel safe, probably because I am a woman I know I have to watch out where I live, I cannot have my husband with me all the time. What I have seen in the trains is very different now than what it used to be. There are a lot of people living there who no one knows who they are.

In fact, the sight of an empty baby stroller alone would do that, let alone with an abandoned wallet next to a phone booth.

It is very sad, to see such a nice place that it used to be being distroyed this way. It used to be like a nice Manhattan sub.

					Aronan, I lived there in the 70&#039;s, and there were plenty of Latin people already living there, but there was a diversity, you could see it in the train station going to work. Now all you see is one race, that&#039;s not diversity. <br /><br />&quot; Part of the reason why Forest Hills didn&#039;t suffer as much and Jackson Heights did is the people who were in JH when the going got tough, got out. They didn&#039;t stick around to see their neighborhood through the tough times&quot;<br /><br />We, and other people we knew, didn&#039;t move out because the going got tough. We got out because we&nbsp; started to see the neighborhood changing, and were afraid for our kids. Did you raise a family there? If you didn&#039;t have a family to be worried about, then your situation is totally diferent than those who have kids to worry about. I still know people there, and what they tell me is totally different to the way you feel. It is not easy to pick up and go, it is costly, and some people have to stay where they have been for many years because they don&#039;t have the means to be moving, and they have a job. I personally like to see neighborhoods moving up, not losing the quality of living, by making them dirty, and unsafe. 30-40 years ago JH was beautiful, and there were plenty of restaurants where to eat. We used to go to a restaurant, I don&#039;t remember the exact address, it was on Roosevelt Ave. and the 80&#039;s, it was called INCA, the food was very good, and they used to have&nbsp; a guy playing the harp, oh boy, that was beautiful music, and what an atmosphere. We also used to go to a Cuban place called Lido, on Roosevelt and 69th St. very good food. But the point is not whether the food is good, or not, the point I am trying to make is that the food in those restaurants they have today could even be better than the food in the 70&#039;s 80&#039;s. The point is that presentation, atmosphere, is also important, I don&#039;t enjoy going to a place that looks filty, doesn&#039;t matter how good it is. How about all those hundreds of men standing on 69 st. and 70st. and Woodside Ave.? Do you see this is safe? Do you know who those guys are? Is it comfortable for a woman to walk around there, and safe? I don&#039;t think so. So my point is, what kind of people would pay for an apartment in this kind of neighborhood $300K, if today you could find one for that price in Manhattan? or in a very nice neighborhood in NJ, 15 minutes away from Manhattan?

The term &quot;garden apartment&quot; was first used in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; It was a planned community (designed right after WWI and built in the late 20s and early 30s) originally designed for working families to share expenses in communal living, with close access to the city using the new extended #7 subway line.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly 27 years ago is when we left Jackson Heights, it was still good, just started to change. I was there recently, and I saw no diversity, the opposite, what I saw was only one kind of people, and right on 82nd. street in one of the restaurants a woman sitting down at the door calling out loud the menu. You see these things happening in third world countries, in the bad part of the cities. This is ghetto like, I have not seen this happening in Manhattan, nor I see it happening in NJ. Also the place looks very dirty, the type of businesses. I understand your point, I know what city living is like, and I love city living, but not this kind. This is not going forward, this is going backwards. This is not USA image. I live in a city in NJ, and it is very clean looking.

					This is great! to find people talking about their old neighborhood. I am glad I found this place. But my question to all of you who left the neighborhood is: What do you think about the neighborhood now? Don&#039;t you think it changed from good, to bad? I heard that there are gangs, and drug dealers kill each other? A friend of mine went to visit a friend in one of the buildings on 82 St. by the hospital, and told me that there was an apartment on her floor sealed by the city because of a drug related crime. What a shame, how come Forest Hills changed to even better, and the apartments there are more reasonable than in Jackson Heights?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[Mod Note:&nbsp; This new topic was split off from another discussion.]</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

It was Sam&#039;s Liquor Store, Sam always&nbsp; gave me pennies when I went in there with my father. <br /><br />On the corner of 73rd St. and 37th road where Kabbab King is now, there used to be a place called Dumbarton Oaks, it was a stripper bar but prior to that it was actually a respectable restaurant (or so I&#039;ve been told).<br /><br />On the same block just past the Eagle (or Earle) theater there was a pizza shop, Benny and Tony were the father son team that ran the place. Sal&#039;s barber shop (now on 76th st.) was also there. Sal still cuts my hair some times. A tiny little deli that never seemed to do any business, and The Magic Touch an old style gay bar. Across the st. there was a type writer repair show. which lasted for the longest time and I believe was replaced by a travel agent. <br /><br />Going west on Broadway where the Korean Market is now, there used to be an A&amp;P.<br /><br />One more block west at 72nd and Broadway there was Gibbons, an Irish bar &amp; restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Over to 37th ave. near 79th St. where Novo currently is was Barrs Toy store.

This was in 1976. We lived on 72nd. street and 41st. Ave. Jackson Heights was the place to live for my family, until we started to notice a big change, then we ran like scare rats in 1980. Roosevelt Ave. became very dirty looking. I used to love going to FIELDS, it was a beautiful store, We had an A&amp;P supermarket on 71st. and Roosevelt. Later on I have been going to check out to see what is new in my old neighborhood, and I have found that it is scaring, I would not like to find myself walking out there in the evening, like I used to do when I used to walk to 82nd. street at anytime. How sad it is to see what is going on on Woodside Avenue. Two blocks of line up men waiting to be picked up to work &quot;jornaleros&quot; I was traveling by car and when I stopped there waiting for the traffic light, I looked at those men and they started to show me the finger. That it is scaring, and that picture distroys a neighborhood. And with the prices they are asking for properties you can buy a mansion in New Jersey, where I moved when I left Jackson Heights. If the neighborhood is not clean, what would happened to people&#039;s investments? Or who would buy an apartment for a quarter of a million in this neighborhood? I am very sad to see that this happened in Jackson Heights. I told my husband one day that when my kids got out of the house him and I will go back to Jackson Heights where we wouldn&#039;d have to drive anymore, but no way, I really don&#039;t feel it could be safe. Please tell me if I am wrong.<br /><br /><strong>Mod Note:&nbsp; A new thread has been created to discuss these issues.&nbsp; Feel free to post at:<br /></strong><br /><a href="index.php@topic=2811.msg18597.html#msg18597" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">JH:&nbsp; Decline and Revival</a>
