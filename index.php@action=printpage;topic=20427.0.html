				The former GNC on 37th and 76th is going to be a location of Mango Rico, the produce stand from further up the avenue. not sure if it&#039;s a move or a branch, but the place is REALLY good and i welcome having it closer to home.

				When the 37th Ave opened I was pleased how much easier it was to move around than 82nd St, but it tends to be much more crowded these days. Will be interested to see the new store. They really are good!

				&quot;Mango Rico offers a few things that slip between the cracks, like poblanos and some fruits.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, and often prices are better. But I do include Growing and Kim on my regular route - they have their own strengths. Kim, for instance, is often good for grapes, and had hothouse cucumbers at 2 for $1 on Friday. <br /><br />I usually look at the outside offerings at all of them, not navigating the insides unless here&#039;s something I really know I want (like poblanos)..<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Post-COVID, I believe there won&#039;t be any &quot;Kale Salad&quot; gentrification-type establishments in Jackson Heights for many years.<br />Chain store suburbanization, yes. But that&#039;s a whole other aesthetic.

				How do you explain the new rice pudding shop then? Isn&#039;t that along the lines of &quot;kale salad&quot; places? And what is wrong with kale salad, anyway? We already have Just Made 4 U, a health food place that seems very popular--and not just with the gentrifier crowd. They have very good, and yes, healthy food tailored for people who don&#039;t want to eat or cannot eat the heavier, richer cuisines available in JH. They may even have kale smoothies, actually.

Initially, i shopped at the 82nd St location, but that got too crowded, so I changed my routine to 37th Ave instead, since there are several grocery shops along that route as well. Always bargaining. :) Never too many Mangos and the employees are always very hard working.

It’s just an interesting spot to choose bc that corner has a high concentration of similar grocers.<br /><br />I don’t know if this is going to happen (prob not), but, personally, I would LOVE if MR did something a little different with this space and maybe included a small juice bar in addition to being a grocer. It could work for them. And aside from Just Made, there aren’t a lot of juice bars on 37th ave unless you go higher up in the 90s. I’d be 100% here for that!!

				The benefits of Mango Rico are that it is very well-organized, neatly presented, brightly lit, prices clearly marked and well-priced.&nbsp; All of those except the last are lacking at my former #1, Kim&#039;s Bros.&nbsp; But I shop at Kim&#039;s because I don&#039;t want to see them have to close, but I bet they will eventually.&nbsp; Mango Rico just isn&#039;t as family funky as the low-down Kim&#039;s, it&#039;s spiffy, yet the prices are not upscale, or just more, as they are at the produce stands on the north side of 37th.&nbsp; That distinguishes them, and is a draw.&nbsp; Less chaotic than the cramped and dimly lit Kim&#039;s. And in my experience Lemon Farm can be counted on to charge $1 more for everything than either Kim&#039;s or Mango R.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;have always had good experience at Kim&#039;s Brothers. The staff is friendly and appreciative, always some fruits and veg sales, and while the aisle is narrow, you really can&#039;t fault them for that since it is a small space.&nbsp; When Mango Rico is too crowded, I often hop over to Kim and also hoping to keep them in business.&nbsp; I&#039;ve started to buy from the new MR because the other two locations are always popular and crowded.
