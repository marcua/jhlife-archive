				Anyone been?<br /><br />Article about Aldi in NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/business/30aldi.html?_r=1)<br /><br />excerpt:<br />About 95 percent of its goods bear an obscure private label. For example, rather than Skippy, Jiffy, natural, and jam-swirled peanut butter, Aldi sells one kind, which it commissions itself. (Itâ€™s similar to the higher-end Trader Joeâ€™s, which is owned by an Albrecht family trust.) <br /><br />â€œWe carry 1,500 of the most popular grocery items out there,â€ Mr. Hart said. â€œYou wonâ€™t find some exotic spice or exotic produce items in our stores; you wonâ€™t find every flavor of every items. When you look at the large supermarkets that may have 20- to 30,000 items, or superstores, with over 100,000 items, itâ€™s surprising to the customers how much of the shopping list weâ€™re able to fit into our smaller store.â€ <br /><br />

				My parents have been going there for several weeks since they opened and they love it.&nbsp; The few things I sampled from there were great as well.&nbsp; As for the shopping bags, kudos to them for trying to encourage everyone to bring totes.&nbsp; They&#039;re sending a message that if you want to kill the planet, it&#039;s gonna cost you!

				I also endorse stores charging money for bags. See the thread in the Neighborhood Chat section about our beautiful trees &quot;festooned with those horrible plastic shopping bags&quot; -- that&#039;s festooned with horrible *free* shopping bags.

I imagine if you&#039;ve never experienced the more progressive supermarkets, it can be quite a shock. I&#039;m glad the cashiers sit. They do that in all the markets in England. Have you ever had a job where you had to stand on your feet for hours on end? And what do the cashier&#039;s have to do with your disappointment in having to pay for bags?

				Is aldi&#039;s organic? Why the reference to trader joes? I thought it was just their brand lines. Do you think they will make it especially since Costco is right across?

				&quot;and to think they pay their cashiers who sit on cushioned chairs, $12 an hour&quot;<br /><br />What I find more shocking about the above comment is that this person seems surprised at the wages of the cashiers. It is called a LIVING WAGE. <br />for a living wage calculator see the following: http://www.livingwage.geog.psu.edu/places/3606151000<br />I have been there and for staples is great. ALDI is the parent company of Trader Joe&#039;s hence the reference.

				I&#039;ve been a few times and have been please every time which is why I continue to go back! As for the bags, wonderful!!! First off, they don&#039;t bag for you which I love because I prefer to do it myself cause I organize the bags so when I get home it takes me no time at all to unload! As for the charging I think it is a great incentive for ppl to bring there own bags and purchase if needed (most likely purchasing less than they would expect if not paying)

				Aldi must be the most polarizing store I&#039;ve heard of. My best friend was forced to shop there for his invalid Dad, and he HATES the place to this day. My Niece in Mn. won&#039;t go to the one near her, as it is for &quot;poor people.&quot; (Well, many of those poor people at this attractive Mn. Aldi are likely millionaires, but that&#039;s another story.) Our sweet friend from Germany was distraught at the lack of Aldi&#039;s in NYC - she just loves the chain.<br /><br />Aldi strikes me as a downscale version of their sister chain, Trader Joe&#039;s (both chains have common ownership - some sort of complex arrangement).<br /><br />If you won&#039;t buy a product that doesn&#039;t spend millions on advertising, then Aldi is not for you. However, if you get the very simple fact that most of these no-name brands are made by the same companies that make the well-known brands, there are stupendous bargains to be had at Aldi.<br /><br />I&#039;d avoid the tubes of ground beef, but then I avoid ALL mass-market ground beef. It is great-looking but mostly unsafe garbage. (Only safe way is to cook the heck out of it.) Otherwise, Aldi has great finds. I wish there was one close to us here in JH.

				Vox,<br /><br />I was on Aldi&#039;s website and they were proud that their beef quality is select. That being the third best grade after prime (which I couldn&#039;t find in JH) and choice (which can be found at The Met).

				OK, now I am keen to get to the new Queens Aldi - will try to do so this week. It is only 4 stops on the M, R and 3 blocks from train stop. Want to see if it is worth driving to. What is the charge for parking, does anyone know? <br /><br />I&#039;ll post my Aldi report on:<br />http://jacksonheights11372.blogspot.com/<br /><br />Also - this week I will try to interview folks behind the mysterious new supmkt. at 81st and Northern, and get some hard facts on this much anticipated new store. That&#039;ll also be on: http://jacksonheights11372.blogspot.com/

				That&#039;s good to hear about Aldi&#039;s meat, but supmkt. ground beef in general is something to be quite wary of, unless you cook it to well done (NY Times magazine did an eye-opening piece a year or so ago - truly scary what goes into a lot of GB. Empire Market in College Point - you&#039;ll need a car but a once a month run will yield the best meat you&#039;ll ever taste - better than organic at slightly more than supmkt. prices. Cold cuts made there, and so are smoked meats and hot dogs. Family run for something like 80 yrs. - third generation now. Simply the greatest:<br /><br />empire-market.com

				Oh, I didn&#039;t mean it to be a good thing. I wouldn&#039;t eat select beef.
