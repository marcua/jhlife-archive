				I started this thread so people could discuss how the coronavirus threat is impacting them, or just discuss fears/worries.<br /><br />I am more afraid of getting it and passing it along to someone with a more vulnerable health condition. I am hopeful that if I were to get it, I would just be sick and recover after a few weeks without having to go to the hospital (fingers crossed).<br /><br />I have to admit all the constant news about it is making me somewhat paranoid.

				Apart from the PSAs put out by the CDC and other health organizations in efforts to contain the virus, I&#039;m interested in knowing what, if any, additional steps folks may be taking to prepare in the event they do become ill. I went on my usual grocery run this past weekend and found myself purchasing a bottle of Tylenol for its fever reducing properties... just in case.&nbsp; And while at the store, I figured I&#039;d pick up some Purell, but that was sold out, of course. On that note, I just heard that NY will be producing its own hand sanitizer, so I guess that&#039;s something people will be looking into.

				&nbsp;Lot&#039;s of colleges have closed for the week now and students appear concerned about that. They worry that this late into the semester, it will impact grades and opportunities for them among many other things but not so much about the health issues as they are often say in the news reports that healthy young people are not at significant risk. But they can spread to the rest of us which is a concern.<br /><br />&nbsp; We have friends in New Rochelle who are not happy at all and are in high risk with age and a family member in a local nursing home as well as college age kids. Scary for them and we all hope to see a healthier time soon.

				I don&#039;t think there is any proof that healthy young people are not at risk. The first case in NJ was a 32-year-old physician who had attended a training session in a hotel in Manhattan. The doctor who first sounded the alarm in China was in his 30s--and he died. It&#039;s wishful thinking that this only seriously affects the elderly--though the fatality rate seems to increase with age, I don&#039;t see any evidence that young people have nothing to worry about. I&#039;ve been reading Twitter feeds from Italy, and that situation is beyond alarming. The hospitals are overwhelmed with serious cases. The US is behind on the infection rate, but may well catch up rapidly. That&#039;s why colleges and companies here are starting to have everyone work or study from home. Which may be the best way to mitigate, as they say, the situation with rapid spread of the virus. Some people seem to be not paying much attention to what is really going on--in denial, most likely. The messages from Italy are urging us to start paying serious attention now--not when it reaches catastrophic proportions. And to not pursue life as usual. I&#039;ve decided to work from home starting tomorrow (fortunately, I can) and basically stay home except for trips to buy food or pharmaceuticals, etc. No movies, theater, exercise classes, and probably no restaurants. It&#039;s just not worth it at this point. I can only hope I&#039;m overreacting, but I think this makes sense, at least for awhile until we see what develops.

				We actually know quite a bit about SARS. We have dealt with SARS coronaviruses before -- in 2003 SARS-CoV and MERS in 2012 prior to SARS-CoV-2 (the disease is COVID-19).<br /><br />https://www.nature.com/articles/424121a<br /><br />The above article from 2003 is general public information, but if you prefer a more scientific read, the works cited are research articles.<br /><br />SARS(2002-2004) did in fact wane drastically as seasons changed. China is currently reporting fewer and fewer new infections.<br /><br />Children especially babies are either not infected or experience little to no distress from COVID-19. I think the link to plumbing/aerosol-suspension of virus (see Nature article) should be further explored, as Italy has extensive use of bidet toilets and is infected widely, well beyond the aged. Babies and young children don&#039;t use the bidet toilet fixture. That&#039;s my take (I get a lot of flack on this forum for thinking outside the box). Beyond that, we know respiratory droplets is key to transmission of the pathogen, but COVID-19, the disease, was spread through travel: planes and ships took COVID around the world.<br /><br />The BIG question is immunity going forward. Will COVID act like flu and mutate enough each season so as to reinfect people yearly.<br />

				It likely has less to do with warmer weather (though that may help?) and more to do with improved Immune response in the general population, due to more sunlight and Vitamin D generation.&nbsp; This is the same with the flu... the virus doesn&#039;t go away in the summer, but people are better equipped to fight it off.<br /><br />Everyone should ensure they are getting adequate Vitamin D levels all year round, but especially during the fall/winter months.

				Agreed on the Vitamin D! People love to think Vitamin C helps, but it&#039;s really Vitamin D. It&#039;s best to use the type that comes with Vitamin K2. And it has a long half-life, so there&#039;s usually no need to take it more than once or twice a week. <br /><br />My sister is the #2 at a federal agency in DC, and she closed their NY office yesterday. She told me she thinks NYC&#039;s response is underwhelming and that city employees should be working from home by now. De Blasio is really downplaying the risk behind the scenes; we had a ridiculous meeting last night and it was full of BS platitudes about how the public is overreacting and this really isn&#039;t a big deal and how we should all be honored to serve the city and should not ask to work from home; &quot;just be sure to wash your hands and you&#039;ll be fine&quot;.

				Something to consider: (copied from another forum)<br /><br />If you have a job that will continue to pay you while you telework or stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak....AND you employ/hire people who do not have such benefits - i.e. a person who walks your dog, cleans your home or tends your yard, provides regular therapeutic massage, has a home hairdressing/braiding business that you patronize regularly - please consider reaching out to these persons and make it clear you will continue to pay them if they are sick or simply want to protect themselves by not coming to your home or their workplace. <br /><br />If we all do this it will: a) be kind and respectful to other workers who do not enjoy the benefits we all should have: and b) help prevent the spread of COVID-19. A 2012 study of people affected by the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. estimated that lack of sick leave (and people then going to work because they had to) was responsible for&nbsp; 5 million additional influenza like illnesses in the U.S. population. (Kumar et al., AJPH 102:1, https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300307).

				I am 33, healthy, and 4 months pregnant. I am EXTREMELY concerned. I am also Italian, and what is going in Italy right now should have everyone feeling alarmed.<br /><br />My family and friends are fine, but the health care system is not. My cousin is a doctor whose hospital is so overrun with the sick from COVID, they have to use their &quot;moral judgment&quot; and choose who to use their resources on, based on who is most likely to survive. I cannot fathom having to make such a decision, nor be in this situation. Also, the information that this disease does not effect younger people is false, as his youngest effected patient is 19. Granted, Italy was not prepared, but then, neither are we. I hope the US takes a lesson from whats going on in Italy, because this is where we will be in a matter of weeks. I sincerely pray that is not the case, but since testing is barely available, the numbers of infected and deaths are completely incorrect. Its much worse than they are reporting. I don&#039;t even want to think about the real numbers we have in NYC..<br /><br />I am not able to work from home just yet (although technically all I need is an internet connection :-\) but since I am pregnant, I may ask for some kind of leave, or leeway. Right now I am taking an uber to work in the morning, and the train back home, since my office is in Astoria, but am wondering if I should just uber both ways? <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to keep supporting my favorite local businesses (letys bakery, farine, samudra, etc.) without physically going. Any suggestions, besides delivery?<br /><br />Take care of yourselves out there, and please, stop stockpiling toilet paper. It literally makes 0 sense to hoard 100 rolls of toilet paper!!

I am EXTREMELY concerned. I am also Italian, and what is going in Italy right now should have everyone feeling alarmed.<br /><br />My family and friends are fine, but the health care system is not. My cousin is a doctor whose hospital is so overrun with the sick from COVID, they have to use their &quot;moral judgment&quot; and choose who to use their resources on, based on who is most likely to survive. I cannot fathom having to make such a decision, nor be in this situation. Also, the information that this disease does not effect younger people is false, as his youngest effected patient is 19. Granted, Italy was not prepared, but then, neither are we. I hope the US takes a lesson from whats going on in Italy, because this is where we will be in a matter of weeks. I sincerely pray that is not the case, but since testing is barely available, the numbers of infected and deaths are completely incorrect. Its much worse than they are reporting. I don&#039;t even want to think about the real numbers we have in NYC..<br /><br />I am not able to work from home just yet (although technically all I need is an internet connection :-\) but since I am pregnant, I may ask for some kind of leave, or leeway. Right now I am taking an uber to work in the morning, and the train back home, since my office is in Astoria, but am wondering if I should just uber both ways? <br /><br />I&#039;d also like to keep supporting my favorite local businesses (letys bakery, farine, samudra, etc.) without physically going. Any suggestions, besides delivery?<br /><br />Take care of yourselves out there, and please, stop stockpiling toilet paper. It literally makes 0 sense to hoard 100 rolls of toilet paper!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One suggestion I heard for helping local businesses is to buy a bunch of gift cards from them now and use later when things are back to normal.

				I want to share this with you all. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51235105<br /><br />It gives instant and up-to-date numbers of what COVID-19 is doing around the world. Just refresh it daily and it will be accurate given our knowledge and presumed cooperation.<br /><br />It would be great to have data by U.S. city (and in our case--borough), but I don&#039;t know of anything like that in existence. Please post if you do.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what the CDC offers, but bear in mind that when you wake up in the morning, CDC data is already 20 hours old and on weekends, FAI. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html <em>scroll down and open box</em> &quot;States&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting that if you click on Illinois you get an option to see some details, including a map.

The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology — which represents ear, nose and throat specialists — says the loss of senses often appears in patients who show none of the earlier known symptoms.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “In young patients, they do not have any significant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste,” the association’s president, professor Nirmal Kumar, told Sky News.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The association said in a statement that anosmia or hyposmia — the medical terms for the loss of smell — have particularly been noted in COVID-19 hotspots around the globe.<br /><br />

If there are problems with your application they will call you (imagine that) within 72 hours rather than you wearing out your batteries with redial.

				Quote from: hfm on April 07, 2020, 07:55:08 PM<br />&quot;There is another report that just came out stating that unlinke SARS or MERS where the viral load is at peak much later in the symptomatic process ....&quot;<br /><br />https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x_reference.pdf<br /><br />Not sure if this is the study to which you refer. I like this one a lot, also because it discusses the GI tract, but especially because it mentions the cleavage site on the spike protein, a topic of another paper that remains unresolved. Fascinating.

The New Jersey address for renewal applications and submitting addition documents is as follows: New York City Department of Finance Rent Freeze Program P.O. Box 3130, Union, NJ 07083 Initial applications cannot go to the New Jersey address and must be mailed to the 59 Maiden Lane address.

DOF is also reviewing additional steps in order to make it easier and be more lenient on documentation requirements such as counter-signed leases. (They should not be asking for counter-signed leases, period, but that’s a perennial fight, for another day.) DOF says it “certainly does not want to add any unnecessary steps to burden the applicants.” DOF emphasizes that its good-cause policy to reinstate applications up to 12 months past benefit expiration will be honored due to Covid-19.

A face covering will not protect you from infection, but it can help others. A face covering can include anything that covers your nose and mouth, including dust masks, scarves and bandanas. Do not use health care worker masks, as those must be preserved for people in the health care system. Even if you have a face covering, continue to stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact with other people.

				Hi neighbors, we spent the winter away, and planned to return to JH on April 1st.&nbsp; But with all the news, we decided to visit and stay with my sister in N.C.&nbsp; it is much less dense here, and there is plenty of space. <br />It seems to me that following distancing protocol is going to be the new normal (for the foreseeable future)+ wearing masks, and common sense. <br />We are considering returning to NY.&nbsp; We are basically treading water here, and I feel we can accomplish the same in JH. <br />My question for you is, is there anything I should bring back with us that’s been difficult to find locally?&nbsp; THANKS

I could be wrong. I do think toilet paper and paper towels are a lot easier to get than they were. Rubbing alcohol 70% and above can still be difficult to get, as well as hand sanitizer and some other cleaners. I heard hair clippers are starting to be difficult to find.&nbsp; Also sometimes flour is out of stock, and yeast for baking can be elusive.

The big problem here is that social distancing is still extremely difficult out on the streets. There are just too many people, and even with people only going out every once in a while when they get cabin fever, the sidewalks are too narrow for people to pass each other at the recommended distance. It&#039;s very difficult here.

				I&#039;d stay in NC too. This remains the epicenter as far as I can tell (I have limited my news consumption). There is wide-spread transmission in a dense neighborhood.<br /><br />I am filled with rage when I think about how the grocery stores and pharmacies in the neighborhood did nothing to implement social distancing protocols about 5 weeks ago. I am filled with rage that the first messaging we got about masks and face coverings was that unless you were sick, there wasn&#039;t a reason to wear them.

				Wait. So we are third most COVID-19 cases in NY?<br /><br />Almost 2/3 of folks have been exposed to COVID-19?<br /><br />That is SHOCKING. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s the language barrier.&nbsp; While the English speaking press was going beserk about the issue... I recall hearing a Spanish radio station interviewing a little girl who had been sent home when schools closed for COVID-19. And the DJ was pretty much completely oblivious as to what was happening as he spoke to her. The little girl had to explain it to the DJ.

				Those are not antibody tests - I think those are just tests for people who felt sick and went to a hospital to get tested to see if they had coronavirus that day. For a while Elmhurst Hospital was testing anyone who lined up.<br /><br />So... in our area, about 2/3 of people who felt sick, actually had coronavirus. It doesn&#039;t mean that 2/3 of all people in Jackson Heights have had coronavirus though. You would need to do antibody testing on a large sample (or everyone) to figure that out.

				I suppose that since we won&#039;t be able to properly patronize restaurants for up to maybe 2 years...until a vaccine is commonplace and the majority of the population is (and feels) safe... all restaurants will have to convert to take out establishments. And that&#039;ll be the new normal.<br /><br />What that means is that restaurants will only need to be kitchens, really. They will become kind of glorified food carts.<br /><br />And will need far, far less space. And overheads (no table servers ).<br /><br />Commercial store rents will definitely tank.&nbsp; <br /><br />The new normal is certainly going to be tough...for landlords, restaurant owners and employees.<br /><br />Jackson Heights, known for its high commercial store rents prior the CORONA CRISIS will change completely.<br /><br />And may become known for LOW commercial rents from now on...with spaces subdivided into smaller areas...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Against my better judgement I will reply to L. And disregard all past experience with L.<br /><br />My pal works in a pharmaceutical lab. The results were looking promising. They were developing a Corona-type (Sars or something) vaccine even before the pandemic. (That&#039;s what he told me). And then the results weren&#039;t promising. The vaccine FAILED its test. Most of the vaccines being developed by the many, many drug labs will FAIL. THEY SIMPLY WON&#039;T WORK. <br /><br />Hopefully, one (or more) vaccines from the many, many other pharmaceutical labs will succeed... Each lab approaches the problem via their own different pathway. The labs definitely DON&#039;T share info. Their specific approach is their intellectual property and patent that lasts for&nbsp; 20 years...during which time they recoup $$$$&#039;s.&nbsp; (x 1 billion in this Corona case)<br /><br />&nbsp;

This latest scam, which is targeting customers already facing hardships due to COVID-19, involves callers who pretend to be National Grid representatives. They tell customers that unless payment is made within 30 minutes, their power will be shut off. The customer is then directed to call “the direct billing department to make a payment and avoid power disconnection.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The scammers use sophisticated phone systems that display National Grid on the customer’s caller ID. Additionally, the phone number customers are instructed to call closely resembles the company’s recorded messaging and phone prompt directions. These elements make it difficult to differentiate an actual National Grid call from an impostor’s call. When in doubt, customers should hang up and call the National Grid customer service number on their bill.<br /><br />-Alternate Side Parking: Alternate Side Parking Regulations will be suspended through Tuesday, May 12.

				After the flurry of hopeful vaccines and drug therapy...I am hearing medics are now also factoring in the situation whereby COVID-19 may become endemic. In other words, no vaccine or treatment for many years.<br /><br />This means...I suppose...we will have to learn to live with folks dying of it.&nbsp; Like in the bad ol&#039; days pre-antibiotics and pre-vaccines...like cholera and typhoid etc...pre-1940&#039;s.<br /><br />

				that scenario has been bandied about a lot lately, and it could very well come to pass. that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to be extremely vigilant these nexxt 18-24 months. we still don&#039;t have a foolproof cholera vaccine (just a workable one), but fortunately this country is relatively protected against the root causes of that disease.
