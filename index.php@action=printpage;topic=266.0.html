She was everyone&#039;s leader. Her background was very international. She was very educated. There is no one else.&quot;<br /><br />As he spoke, an Urdu newspaper was delivered with the headline, &quot;Benazir Bhutto Killed in Suicide Attack&quot; splashed across the front.<br /><br /><br /><em>(follow link for remainder of article)</em>

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=266.msg1203.html#msg1203">Quote from: John Prester on December 30, 2007, 11:53:47 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m sure the local Jackson Heights branch of Al Qaeda, &quot;The Islamic Thinkers&quot;, will be issuing a condolence statement very soon.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Perhaps you meant that the condolence statement would be fake and hollow, used only to gain sympathy amongst the mourners, but a right-wing religious group like al-Qaâ€˜ida, and thus presumably the Islamic Thinkers, would have <em>hated</em> Benazir Bhutto. As a matter of fact, an al-Qaâ€˜ida commander has claimed responsibility for the assassination. See http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070037061&amp;ch=12/28/2007%208:21:00%20AM (http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070037061&amp;ch=12/28/2007%208:21:00%20AM).<br /><br />Miss Bhutto was a feminist who was the first woman prime minister of an Islamic state. She was head of the Pakistan Peopleâ€™s Party, a progressive center-left party that promoted the rights of women and the poor. Their credo is â€œIslam is our faith; democracy is our politics; socialism is our economy; all power to the people.â€ Her assassination was an attempt to keep more liberal, progressive and secular leadership out of power in Pakistan.
