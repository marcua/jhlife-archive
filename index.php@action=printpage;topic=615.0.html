				I came across this enlightening video addressing the issue of how product consumption affects our world.&nbsp; This animated video begins with an explanation of how the extraction of the earth&#039;s natural resources are processed in order to manufacture the products we use every day.&nbsp; It continues by focusing on production, distribution, consumption and disposal of mainstream items such as computers, coffee cups, iPods, etc., all with the concluding message that it is our responsibility to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly world.<br /><br />The video runs approximately 20 minutes, but it&#039;s engaging and fun to watch.&nbsp; A true eye-opener!<br /><br />Originally posted in the JH Families Listserv<br /><br />http://www.storyofstuff.com/

				With the warm weather months approaching, I think it would be a good idea to remind business owners to please keep their doors closed when running their air conditioners.&nbsp; I see this all the time during the summer months, and it&#039;s a terrible waste of energy.&nbsp; I would imagine that it&#039;s expensive as well...so why do it? :-\

				Unfortunately, they do this to entice people to enter. When you&#039;re walking by in 95 degree weather and feel a blast of cool air, you want to step in and cool off. I agree it&#039;s wasteful, though I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll stop doing it unless they are fined.

				I love the anti-plastic bag campaign.<br /><br />I have a canvas bag right here from the Good Food Store in Missoula, MT, it has the Good Food Store logo on one side and 10 advertisements on it from big health/organic product companies on the other.&nbsp; I can definitely imagine a Jackson Heights bag with a JH logo and ads from local businesses.&nbsp; Grocery stores could sell them at the check out counter (next to In Touch Magazine).<br /><br />(http://www.room309online.com/images/bag/front.jpg) (http://www.room309online.com/images/bag/back.jpg)<br /><br />We could develop an activity or two for elementary and middle school teachers to do with their students to teach them about the benefits of using reusable bags.&nbsp; Thus brainwashed, they would go on to pester their parents until they buy the&nbsp; JH reusable shopping bag.<br /><br />I remember reading recently that Ireland had reduced plastic bag use by 90%(!) by placing a tax on plastic bags and providing canvass alternatives.&nbsp; Could we convince local shops to charge a plastic bag fee?<br /><br />

				I would be very interested in the experiences of other communities that have adopted programs to decrease plastic bag consumption.&nbsp; Why reinvent the wheel, right?<br /><br />My concern is always that this type of initiative often don&#039;t get community-wide buy-in and soon lose momentum.&nbsp;

				This may come off as a rather strange commentary on the subject, but how do you convince dog owners to stop using the plastic supermarket bags for clean-up purposes?&nbsp; This seems to be the method of choice for many dog owners.<br /><br />We use the Bags on Board caddy along with biodegradable bags, but I&#039;m pretty sure most people would not want to invest in refills.&nbsp; What would our streets look like then?

				Hi - I have couple of longtime friends that just started a green design company called SKN.

				I have a huge LL Bean tote that holds <strong>lots</strong> of groceries.&nbsp; Occasionally there are times when I don&#039;t have it with me and have to get a plastic bag.&nbsp; Those are more than enough to give me an ample supply for apartment trash can use.<br /><br />I have a question:&nbsp; Is there somewhere in the nabe to drop off used batteries?

				This occurred to me yesterday: We are trying to get away from using plastic grocery bags, okay. But we need to throw out our garbage. Even if we can find paper sacks to put the garbage in, it is dumped into a really heavy black plastic bag which will take much longer, if ever, to decompose. <br /><br />Depressing.

				&nbsp;<br />This Saturday Jackson Heights Beautification Group will be having a special clean and green event.&nbsp; In this &quot;garden neighborhood&quot; there is limited public green space, that is why it is so important that the little green space we have is maintained.&nbsp; There is an open space on 69th Street between 37 and 34th Avenue next to the BQE which has a nice wall and open green space.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it has become an area for dumping trash and letting weeds grow.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />This Saturday we want to make a statement.&nbsp; We want to clean up the area and then show our politicians that the city must maintain this area.&nbsp; Community Board 3 has agreed to put a dog run next to the area (under the BQE) which I hope is the first step to better utilizing this green space.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope you will come and pitching in, but more importantly, by showing up you&nbsp; show our local politicians that we want our green spaces maintained!<br />&nbsp;<br />Please come and bring a friend!&nbsp; &nbsp;If possible, please post this flyer in your building to encourage your neighbors to pitch in for a better Jackson Heights.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please call myself at 646-210-4495 or Beatrice Ruiz at 347-665-6063.

				Consider bringing your own mugs or cups to coffee shops.&nbsp; The coffee cups they give you are piling up in garbages.&nbsp; They are destroying the environment.
