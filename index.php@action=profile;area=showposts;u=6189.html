					I have to concur with what has been said - lack of amenities, infrastructure, ongoing loss of charm on our shopping streets, neighborhood upkeep - all contribute to why I don&#039;t think this place will go for what they are asking. I would in fact be surprised if it went for over $1 million. JH is not there yet, regardless of how you compare it to Brooklyn neighborhoods. I am a third generation JH resident - my family and I have rented and owned throughout the neighborhood since the 1920&#039;s - and I can tell you there has always been a mix - upper middle, straight middle and working classes in the neighborhood. For me, its not about being priced out of the neighborhood, its about reality check. One of my very good friends for many years is one of the top brokers in BK. She has seen my mother&#039;s place, an aunt&#039;s, my late uncle&#039;s and my own and she too at first equated the houses and co-ops to BK equivalents - saying how we should get much more then we were/did. But she did her research and realized that JH still has a bit to go before those prices hit the neighborhood - but has recommended continuously to buy and hold and then call her when the prices jump! lol <br />I think it is a mixed blessing for JH that many of the old local realtors seem to have been replaced by the larger companies. Many of those locals would keep pocket listings for who they knew may like it or might be looking and more importantly, they knew the neighborhood - good and bad - and were able to advise owners how to price appropriately - and if they liked you as the buyer, would let you know what to offer under the asking price. The larger companies have put JH on the map and helped raise prices. I heard a 3 bed in Southridge just went for $300K - unheard of previously but great news for Southridge and Northridge co-ops. I don&#039;t know if Laffey are local or not but at the end of the day, the market will determine the price, regardless of what realtors and sellers want or how we may feel about it here. I&#039;m still curious about the interior as I believe that will say a lot about how much this place will eventually sell for. <br />

					While original details - moldings, tiles, arches, parquet floors, etc. - are all great and desirable, it all depends on how they&#039;ve been maintained in the 80+ years since these houses went up. I&#039;ve seen some (on 86th and other blocks) that are maintained fantastically, others that haven&#039;t been up kept in those 80+ years and look horrendous and still others that got &quot;updated&quot; in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s and are so badly dated now needing a full reno/restoration. I would say in general, based on my own experience/eyes and what&#039;s posted online (big red flags when kitchens and/or baths are described as &quot;vintage&quot; or &quot;original&quot; and the realtor shows no pics), you&#039;d be hard pressed to find any house in JH that doesn&#039;t need a good deal of work. The houses on 85, 86, and 87 are pretty special and it is no surprise the records are on that block for 1st and 2nd priciest ever sold (I thought $940K was the most recent/2nd highest in Dec &#039;13 with $999K the highest in 2007) - even when the rest of the neighborhood was in the crapper, those houses always sold high (as ACRIS showed for this one). I just think a jump of nearly 50% is pretty ballsy. There is much that needs to be improved in the neighborhood still before these houses can command $1+million prices (other than cash buyers looking to park their money like the condo buyers on 37th, if someone is paying $1+million, there are certain amenities they&#039;ll expect which the neighborhood doesn&#039;t have yet) - it can happen, but it will take longer in my opinion - and don&#039;t forget, buyers pay an additional &quot;Mansion Tax&quot; for any house bought for $1 million or more. Who knows tho - maybe this house will break the record and go for $1+million - or maybe it will just tie the record. It will be interesting to watch this one and see how it plays out.

					But with a condo -or co-op- you know going in you have shared walls, etc. and no real control over your neighbors (well, more control in a co-op, but still) but if they abuse &quot;house rules&quot;, you have redress. When owning a home, you really don&#039;t have any - suppose they&#039;re slobs, inviting vermin into theirs and by extension yours. Or if they don&#039;t keep up their yard, gardens and such. You may have spent the money, but if your neighbors&#039; places don&#039;t look nice and are well maintained, you&#039;ll never get it back (walk down 86th, you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about - some owners obviously have house pride, others look like they came out of &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; - who wants to share a drive or a wall with that?).<br />I&#039;ve never seen a house in Queens sell for more than $1 million that is attached (this is a semi-detached - the left of the pic is the other house) with a shared driveway on a normal 40x80 or 40x100 lot. Plus who knows what the interior is like (no pics). It may be on an historic block, in an historic district, but it is not surrounded by million dollar homes - there&#039;s rentals up the block and around the corner and there are some former 1-families that were converted to 2 families and grandfathered in once the historic district came into play. I think these realtors (and the owner) are beyond delusional thinking they&#039;ll get anything near $1.45mill.

					*phew* I&#039;m glad its not just me! :-) <br /><br />I do think the interior must need substantial work/updating since there are no pics - which is kind of normal as a lot of these houses have had a few owners (sometimes the same family) since being built. I&#039;ve been in these houses as well as the ones across the street (the ones with the room over the garage) and while this is the one block in JH I would buy a house on (the one I covet is the one nearest to 35th Ave with the extra lot/large side yard bordering the old Christian Science Church), none of these are $1+ million houses (well, maybe because of the extra lot, the house I covet could get slightly over $1mill). <br /><br />I get the realtors want to list high for commission and the owners want the biggest return possible, but as a buyer, looking up previous sale prices (which you can on ACRIS for NYC) I would be &quot;WTF?&quot; seeing this price and knowing what comps in the neighborhood are. Some argue it will bring up all the prices, but I don&#039;t think that will ever be the case in JH. We&#039;re no Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights or Forest Hills either building or amenities wise plus as they&#039;re attached, why do you want to pay so much when you have no idea how the other owner treats their property/keeps it inside and what that may mean for you.

Yes, we all love JH and all that, but seriously, $1.45 million? I know a lot of the houses between 35th and 34th Avenues in the 80&#039;s are pretty big - but its a semi-detached, shared drive, tiny yard, regular lot - I can&#039;t see this price. I&#039;ve seen other semi-attached and fully attached listed for sale in recent months, all nice and big, but all under a million (usually in the 750-950 range, but who knows what they closed for). With no pics, I&#039;m suspicious this probably needs a ton of work too. Not familiar with this realtor either - so who knows if they are copying from another local guy who is (in)famous for inflated prices (yet tight lipped about eventual sale price) or if they truly think they&#039;ll be the first house in JH to go for over a million (plus mansion tax for the buyer). <br /><br />Curious about any thoughts you guys have to share - or is it just me?

					Thanks Native! <br /><br />I just don&#039;t get how/why this Board keeps rejecting contractors who work primarily in co-ops and condos in JH and know what they need - and have it! I mean, I have my suspicions, but, well, you know...<br /><br />The only thing remotely related to plumbing going on in this job would be the replacement of the sink and dishwasher in the kitchen and a new sink/vanity in the bathroom. I believe the whole &quot;he isn&#039;t a plumber&quot; thing was just an excuse to reject as the not being a plumber was never raised with any other contractor. <br /><br />It is hugely frustrating dealing with this Board - and I agree with your colorful characterization of them. <br /><br />Here is hoping either the contractor recommended in this thread or one of the ones sent to me via PM will be approved by the Board. <br /><br /><br />THANKS!<br />J.

					Hi Native - <br /><br />They&#039;ve turned down ones with the coverage for other reasons (one was &quot;he&#039;s not a licensed plumber&quot; yet neither were any of the others) and&nbsp; one with the coverage they turned down b/c they claimed his coverage was &quot;too convoluted&quot; to be sure the co-op was covered sufficiently. All of these contractors have worked either in the other Northridge Sections or other co-ops in Jackson Heights (Berkely, Chateau, Warwick, etc.) so they all have dealt with Boards and to a man all have said this Board is the worst they&#039;ve ever dealt with (one - the one who had his insurance referred to as convoluted - called them a lot more and in a lot more colorful language than that!). I feel their pain. I just this done and over with already, you know? <br /><br />Since you seem to know about these issues, any chance you have any recommendations on contractors for the job? <br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br />J.

					Thank you for your reply, Carrefour!<br /><br />I agree that the issue is much more with the Board than with the contractors. Unfortunately the Board is top heavy with members who have been on it over 20 years - and the upkeep and mgmt of the building shows it. They (the Board) don&#039;t have the experience with many of the new reno requirements so they rely on one or two members who have the &quot;contacts in the industry&quot; which in and of itself makes me wary of the whole process and who they recommend instead (q.v.). <br /><br />There is a memo from the Board to all shareholders from about 5 years ago when these reno policies went into place which outlines what the shareholder needs to do and what are the requirements for any contractor. We have been going by this and have always let contractor know what they need at the first meeting. These contractors by and large have met with all the requirements, and when there was a question on the umbrella insurance (some have had less than $5 million), the brokers (co-op&#039;s and contractor&#039;s) spoke and resolved. Other than the 1 contractor who was rejected because the co-op&#039;s broker didn&#039;t like the language in his umbrella policy, none of the others were rejected for insurance issues; all the others have been rejected for ridiculous reasons, so it is frustrating. <br /><br />What is kind of silly about the reno policy is that if you, the shareholder, do any reno in your co-op you don&#039;t need any additional insurance beyond your homeowner&#039;s policy. Same with having building staff do work in the co-op - plumbing, electrical, etc. - none are licensed yet no problem there. <br /><br />There is one (1) contractor they have pushed/recommended to my mother repeatedly - who is Board Approved - but the Board member who recommends him is also tied in with the co-op&#039;s insurance broker, and the contractor is insured thru the same broker - it really makes me (and others) think something is going on not quite kosher in these arrangements. It does not help that this contractor&#039;s work is not all that good/neat, and he is pretty pricey. <br /><br />I agree 100% with you Carrefour, that the Board does have a responsibility to the building and the corporation - I have no problem with that - my problem is with this Board&#039;s perception of their responsibility and execution. Its lopsided and really not in the long term best interest of the building, corporation and shareholders - evident by the fact this section has the lowest sale prices of any of the Northridge and Southridge sections. <br /><br />Ina any event - I really do appreciate your comments - apologies for the vent/rant - and I would deeply appreciate any recommendations you - and anyone else -&nbsp; may have to offer on contractors - feel free to PM me any info you wish. <br /><br />&nbsp;I just wonder how many of them are ones we&#039;ve had come in to price that were ultimately rejected by the Board.&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/undecided.gif" alt="&#58;-\" title="Undecided" class="smiley" />

					Hi all - <br /><br />I&#039;m in desperate need of recommendations for good, reliable and reasonable contractors in JH. <br /><br />I have been trying to get my mother&#039;s kitchen and bathroom done over for nearly a year now. My mother lives in a co-op - Northridge II - and so far the bloody Board has rejected 5 different contractors. These contractors have all worked in JH in places like the Chateau, the Warwick, the Berkley, the Greystones and other Northridge sections. All came recommended from friends or on here (or both) and all were rejected for silly reasons - one was rejected because they thought his insurance coverage was &quot;too convoluted&quot;, another because he wasn&#039;t a licensed plumber (the only one to get that reason even though all would have been installing a new dishwasher - didn&#039;t know a licensed plumber was needed for that!) and silly stuff like this. Needless to say, the contractors weren&#039;t happy and I&#039;m fairly furious over it all. I also have to admit, I don&#039;t understand why the Board rejects them - these contractors have worked and done far more construction-like work (ie; moving walls, putting in pass thrus, combining closets to make one big one, etc.) in buildings that are, in fairness, much better than Northridge and sell for much more - all without any issue. I suppose when a co-op is self managed like Northridge II, this is what you get - Board members making decisions that they have no qualifications or clue about. Annoying nonetheless. <br /><br />I need a contractor who carries all the normal licenses and insurance and who also has a $5 million dollar umbrella coverage. <br /><br />The job, as it is in a co-op, is pretty simple:<br /><br />1. Kitchen - remove the old cabinets, flooring and appliances; lay new floor, paint walls, install new cabinets and appliances<br /><br />2. Bathroom - remove old vanity, medicine chest and light, paint and install new vanity, medicine chest and light<br /><br />3. Painting - rest of the co-op needs to be painted - dining room, living room, foyer and two bedrooms. Removing old ceiling fans in the bedrooms and installing new ones as well as removing chandelier in DR and fixture in foyer and replacing.<br /><br />As I said, fairly desperate to get this done as soon as possible - the mother is insisting it be done by Christmas - so any recommendations, advice, etc. would be greatly appreciated!!!<br /><br /><br />THANKS!<br />J.

					Hi - <br /><br />I would be very interested in hearing anything about this contractor - please PM me! <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty desperate - I&#039;ve been trying to get my mother&#039;s kitchen and bathroom done for nearly a year and the bloody board in her co-op has rejected 5 contractors for silly reasons. I need a contractor who has regular liability insurance, workman&#039;s comp, etc. and who also has a $5 million umbrella liability coverage. It should be noted that all of the contractors are local JH guys who were recommended either on here or from friends living in the Chateau, the Warwick, the Berkley and Greystones or both. My mother is in Northridge II - which is not the same scale as those places, so why all this extra insurance is required for a simple swap out is beyond me and pretty infuriating to be honest. <br /><br />The job is pretty easy - take out old cabinets, flooring and appliances in kitchen - paint, lay new floor, put in new cabinets and appliances. Bathroom is even simpler - paint and install new vanity, mirror and light. Also on the table is painting the rest of the co-op (dining room, living room, foyer and 2 bedrooms). <br /><br />THANKS!<br /><br />J.

					Thanks, NYC Native for your reply and input. <br /><br />I was surprised my Manhattan friends (UWS - 70&#039;s) didn&#039;t require more than $2 million when they combined apts in a pre-war park block building no less - but I can&#039;t see why for a simple swap out of old to new Northridge wants $5 million. You&#039;re saying when you did single co-op renovations in JH, $5 million was what they asked for? If so, I&#039;m wondering why the co-ops I checked with now do not require that much - most co-ops in JH don&#039;t let you do very much beyond replace things (cabinets, toilets, tubs, tiles, etc.) versus opening walls or moving sinks which then I could understand a $5 million policy. &nbsp;But, you&#039;re right in that this board are all elderly and set in their ways (to put it mildly). The $5 million also applies if you&#039;re getting your apt painted (which I couldn&#039;t believe) - yet if any shareholder does the work him or herself (cabinets, painting, flooring, etc.) according to the &quot;House Rules&quot;, no additional insurance is required. Same if they (the Co-Op) send up one of the handymen or super to take care of work (plumbing, electrical, plastering, painting, etc.) that is the fault of the Co-Op, I know not one is licensed. <br /><br />On thinking about it, I agree - perhaps the lawyer isn&#039;t the best idea. I am just curious about the insurance carrier for this one guy they keep pushing on my mother - I have a feeling its from the same broker the Co-Op uses. Maybe just a nice pleading letter from little old widow to the board might be the better route. All this stuff is bought - and this contractor has given a great price - just frustrating especially when I see others in my mother&#039;s Co-Op not following the &quot;House Rules&quot;. I told my mother next time, don&#039;t say a word to the Board like everyone else. <br /><br />On the contractor they keep pushing - from what we know he isn&#039;t too expensive, but his work isn&#039;t the best either. Nice for some, but not work I would pay for, you know?

					Hi all - I&#039;m just curious if any of you know what your Boards require w/r/t insurance carried by the contractor. I only ask as while trying to get my mother&#039;s kitchen redone (a simple out with the old cabinets, appliances, floor and in with the new - no structural work, etc.) in Northridge2, I found out they require a $5 million dollar liability coverage from the contractor. I&#039;ve asked friends in Manhattan who have had renovations done in their co-ops (which clearly sell for a lot more) and none required this. I&#039;ve asked friends in JH (Chateau, Hawthorne Court, Warwick, Berkley) and none require this much either. While Northridge2 apts are nice, they&#039;re not in the Historic District and they don&#039;t sell anywhere near what they do in any of the JH co-ops I mentioned, so I am at a loss why they are requiring such coverage - especially on such a simple job. While the Board agreed to work with us (after it was pointed out all the other work being done by other shareholders who did not go thru Board) - that was over 6 months ago and we&#039;re on the verge of having the 3rd contractor walk away as the Board keeps keeps giving us the runaround (&quot;we don&#039;t determine the insurance required, the broker does&quot; only to phone the broker and be told &quot;I don&#039;t determine it, the Board does&quot; etc.) and changing what the reason is the contractor can&#039;t work there. Latest is that the Co-Op&#039;s insurance broker didn&#039;t like the contractor&#039;s insurance carrier (an A+ rated carrier and its a $1 million coverage - more than enough for the simple job). They keep pushing this 1 contractor on my mother, which makes me suspicious. I&#039;m at the point of asking my attorney to intervene as looking at the whole picture, it seems to me they&#039;re trying to force my mother to only use this one contractor, which begs the question who benefits there? I want to get this done (floor and appliances are paid for and in storage) but I also want it done by someone I trust and that I&#039;ve seen and like their work - I don&#039;t want to be forced to use this 1 contractor the Board has approved - and I know my mother would be happy to se her 1970&#039;s kitchen gone finally. I&#039;d be really curious and grateful if any of you could share what your co-ops/condos require here and if any of you worked in or live in Northridge and had to deal with this type of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;

					I just wanted to thank everyone who commented on this post and sent messages with suggestions, names, numbers - everything. All of you were truly helpful!!<br /><br />I am happy to report that after a very stressful couple of weeks of calling the numbers you sent, walking around talking with supers on the weekends and looking at a number of apartments, I was able to secure a really nice apartment in Washington Plaza. If anyone is looking I would *highly* recommend Eileen - she made the entire process so easy - <a href="mailto:rentthrueileen@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">rentthrueileen@gmail.com</a><br /><br />Now to find a mover for the big move - all of 2 blocks - ha!&nbsp;

					Hi - <br /><br />I was recommended to this board by a friend and hoping someone on here could offer some help and direction. <br /><br />I&#039;m a native &quot;Jackson Heights-er&quot; - no matter how many times I move out, I always wind up back here. Anyway, I&#039;ve been living for the last 7 years in a great apt on 76th - however my landlord (it is a sublet) will be selling so I need to move. Why aren&#039;t I buying you may wonder? Honestly, I&#039;m still recovering from paying for the costs associated with two terminal cancer illnesses in my family. If I could, trust me I would. <br /><br />In any event, I want to stay in JH and am looking for a 1 (or 2) bedroom apt - preferably in the 70&#039;s and hopefully around the $14-1500 or so mark - and a real rental this time, not a sublet from a coop. As I&#039;ve begun looking, I&#039;m running into a lot of coop sublets (which are limited to 1 or 2 yrs max) but hardly anything on real rental units - and I know there are a ton in JH. Even the RE agents I&#039;ve contacted seem to deal pretty much in coop sublets. <br /><br />So anyone know of any or have a 1-2 bedroom rental available September at the $14-1500 mark - please get in touch!! <br /><br />Thanks very much for any and all help any of you may offer!! <br /><br />**If it helps - I&#039;m a 40 yr single white collar professional male with a solid work history; excellent references (professional and personal); references from current and previous landlord; good salary and &quot;OK&quot; credit (see above on paying for costs of two terminal cancer illnesses). Thanks Again!**
