Jackson Heights is a fairly low-income neighborhood--poorer than Livonia Ave on the L (Brownsville) and 135th street on the 3 (Harlem). Data like this might help explain why the sorts of restaurants a lot of people would like to see haven&#039;t gravitated to the area.<br /><br /><a href="https://projects.newyorker.com/story/subway/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://projects.newyorker.com/story/subway/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is an interesting tool but doesn&#039;t seem to account very well for population density. The median <em>household</em> income at the Mets-Willets Point stop is $100,000, almost double what it is for 74th/Roosevelt. If I were Panera or many other businesses, I&#039;d much rather take my chances opening on 74th and Roosevelt rather than Willets point (not counting Citifield attendees)

New people moved in and the area developed a completely new identity. Like it or not, it&#039;s a well-established reality over a really long period of time. <br /><br />I agree the businesses should do more to clean up after their customers, and around their establishments regardless, but it&#039;s completely different community than what some people here are apparently longing for and it&#039;s time to move on, one way or another.&nbsp; Cities, and the world, evolves and it&#039;s only going to get more &quot;unrecognizable&quot; as developers come in and start building on more of the sites. It&#039;s too bad ya&#039;ll didn&#039;t buy up all that land and create your vision of upper middle class paradise when you had the chance.<br /><br />I&#039;m grateful for all the work the city has done down there with traffic control and now making a big investment in the plaza, all of it in response to the community. Between that, Dromm bringing in an organization to clean (first the Doe Fund now ACE) and the work of other groups, and yes, the diversity, there is much to appreciate in the present day.<br />

The many&nbsp; shoppers--and loitering customers--dropping their trash along 73rd&nbsp; and 74th street and 37th avenue is a bigger issue than the plaza, in my opinion. <br /><br />Last I noticed, there are garbage cans on each corner of every intersection on 37th from around 75th or 76th street street up but not one on any corner below there. This may be because sanitation removed them due to too much household garbage being dumped, I don&#039;t know. But only one store around there even has a sign that says &quot;Customers please don&#039;t throw your garbage on the street&quot;<br /><br />Obviously the plaza wasn&#039;t fancy before this reno and agree it probably won&#039;t be ideal after, but I often saw women and children there, and think it’s much better for the general vicinity since they closed that little street to traffic. <br /><br />It&nbsp; seemed very well-used by assorted members of the JH/Elmhurst community who were not prostitutes, drunks, drug addicts and/or homeless. People like that were hanging around and inside that subway entrance well before the street was closed, they’re just more visible by comparison to all the regular people who are also using the area since the traffic is gone. In general, the seediness level seems much better to me than when cars and buses dominated.<br /><br />I remain hopeful the renovated plaza will be a positive influence over time, and in any case think it’s much better than it was.<br />

					<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size">I’m happy to be able to add another positive recommendation for Eddie Corrigan, who renovated my kitchen recently. <br /><br />It was my first time renovating so there was a steep learning curve, but Eddie was patient with my lack of knowledge (not to mention excess anxiety) and helpful every step of way. I never got the feeling that he took advantage of my inexperience.&nbsp; <br /><br />The job was pretty straight forward with the exception of my walls--evidently the plaster lathe walls in my kitchen are bowed in assorted spots around various pipes, but they did a remarkable job of getting all the cabinets to hang evenly, flush with each other and flush with the wall all along. (Now I understand why the old cabinets had bizarre random gaps everywhere, including between the wall and cabinets). In addition to looking good/normal, I’m confident they are all secure and I can load them up. <br /><br />One bowed wall also presented a challenge for the counter but Eddie had them use a scribe when they measured so the counters sit beautifully flush all along as well. He also took extra care with the backsplash installation so the spacing between tiles would remain even. I’m not sure how any other contractor would’ve handled this wonky wall situation, but it seemed to me I was reaping huge dividends from his experience and integrity (and also the high quality of his craftsmen and team.)<br /><br />Speaking of walls and quality, they also skim coated (and painted) a hallway ceiling and wall, and OMG what a revelation….I had no idea regular plaster walls (even good condition ones) looked so bad until I saw the magic of skim coating. I can’t say I would have it done on every wall in my apartment, but I sure am looking forward to having it done in select other places.<br /><br />Hot2015 makes some good suggestions above as now I can see clearly how important it is to connect in some way with one’s contractor. Also, if I ever renovate something again I would quadruple the level of details on my lists, at minimum. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire Eddie Corrigan again though as I really appreciated his high standards and experience.</span>

The general height of buildings has been restricted to 6 floors due to the landing concerns for La Guardia Airport. While 74th Street is notdirectly in a possible flight path, it is close. Therefore, there should be consideration for this also.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Apartment buildings often top out at 6 stories due to economics and gravity.&nbsp; Residentials north of that have to be fireproof and require a water tower/pump system.&nbsp; While setback requirements and sunlight plane exposures do limit building height in a sense, the zoning resolution generally limits bulk by Floor Area Ratios (FAR&#039;s) to encourage generous floors heights.&nbsp; In this case, however, given the c4-3 zoning, setback requirements and build plan, it could have went higher, but LGA flight path considerations limited elevation to the proposed height.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Regal Heights, the rehabilitation and nursing facility on 35th Avenue and 70-71 Streets, received a zoning variance (or whatever the technical term) and is 8 stories tall. That building is literally directly under the landing path. <br /><br />And speaking of zoning heights, unless something has changed, the zoning for 73, 74, 75 streets between 37th and Roosevelt allow for up to 12 stories. I wish more people shared my concern about this, not that getting it changed would be easy or even possible at all.

					If you are really serious about getting rid of your cat, maybe you could consider offering up some money toward food, supplies and vet bills, and possibly some other kind of support for the person who would take a &quot;frail&quot; older cat off your hands, such as being the one to take the cat for vet visits, etc.
