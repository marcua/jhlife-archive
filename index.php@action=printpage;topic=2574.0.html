				I noticed an ad on craigslist where someone wrote:<br /><br />&quot;I am looking to view an apartment with the bathroom and the kitchen combined. Like in the show Ugly Betty. I am working on a NYC scavenger hunt.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/sbw/1118491818.html<br /><br />I&#039;ve only seen Ugly Betty once and don&#039;t remember the kitchen/bathroom combo.<br /><br />Are there many apartments like this around NYC?<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve watched Ugly Betty more than once, but have never noticed the combo as described in the ad.&nbsp; I know someone that once lived in one of the tenement walkup apartments on 9th Avenue.&nbsp; Her apartment had a bathtub atop a platform in the kitchen.&nbsp; There was no water faucet in the tub, so she had to use a bucket to fill the tub with water.&nbsp; What pain!&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if this is what the Craigslist person is referring to though.&nbsp;

				My aunt had an apartment in one of the old tenement buildings on 98th between Lexington and Third.&nbsp; She kept the apartment so she could live in Puerto Rico six months, and in New York six months.&nbsp; She was paying $100 at the time and allowed me to live in it gratis while I attended college.&nbsp; And yes, the bathtub was in the kitchen, next to the kitchen sink, and it was quite delightful.&nbsp; The tub was a true conversation piece.&nbsp; I could watch my meal cook as I bathed.&nbsp; Once I was done, I simply had to cover the tub, which then served as counter space.&nbsp; Unbelievable! :smiley6600:

				Marlene, these apartments are definitely conversation pieces.&nbsp; The apartment I went to had an actual water closet...an old fashioned chain toilet where the tank was high on the wall.&nbsp; What&#039;s wild is that the apartment had the most amazing crown moldings and working fireplace.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the walls had layers of paint and dated wallpaper.<br /><br />I also know a family that lived in one of the tenements off Delancey Street.&nbsp; I loved visiting that apartment as a kid.&nbsp;

				Chuckster:<br /><br />Forgot to mention my aunt&#039;s apartment had the &quot;water closet...an old fashioned chain toilet where the tank was high on the wall&quot;.&nbsp; Great memories, especially that chain toilet.&nbsp; Just lift your right hand up and pull.&nbsp; Lift and pull.&nbsp; Lift and pull.&nbsp; Great workout.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Let&#039;s not forget the great challenge to get into the kitchen tub.&nbsp; That as well was one heck of a workout.&nbsp; :smiley6600:

				I used to live in Chelsea on 16th Street off 8th Ave in Manhattan in a railroad apartment&nbsp; for 8 years back in the 70&#039;s.&nbsp; There were 8 apartments on the 3 level building.&nbsp; 2 apts on the left and 2 on the right of each floor.&nbsp; The left side apartment shared a common water closet in the middle of the public hallway.&nbsp; Those apartment on the right had there own water closet inside the apartment.&nbsp; My apartment was on the right.&nbsp; You walk into the kitchen, tub to you right, sink across the room.&nbsp; Living room to the right after kitchen and bedroom to the left from the kitchen follow by the water closet. Had great times living there.&nbsp; After I move, the owners had the apt. renovated.&nbsp; Instead of the tub is now a shower stall, still in the kitchen.

				Friends of mine lived in a Village apartment with a bath tub in the kitchen.&nbsp; I was always amazed at how much cold beer it could contain :),&nbsp; it kept many a party going, and going and.....!

				The photo from Apartment Therapy demonstrates what a huge difference light colors and a little ingenuity can make in dressing up older tenement apartments today.<br /><br />Earlier this year, I visited the Tenement Museum (http://www.tenement.org/), a museum located on the Lower East side that&#039;s dedicated to sharing the experiences of the building&#039;s immigrant residents from years gone by.&nbsp; By taking one of the guided tours, you get to see first hand how people managed daily tasks during very difficult times and harsh living conditions.&nbsp; It&#039;s fascinating stuff.&nbsp; I mentioned earlier in this thread that as a child I frequently visited people who lived in one of the buildings off Delancey.&nbsp; Back then, I didn&#039;t take into account all the hardships people must have experienced as residents in that community.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I was very intrigued by the small rooms, lack of windows and non-functioning gas lamps in the hallways.&nbsp; I find it amazing that today, some of these same apartments in tenement buildings are commanding high rents.

				Yes, east 3rd street b/t A and B and east 5th street b/t A and B.&nbsp; This is typical of pre Certificate of Occupancy ghetto housing in the Lower East Side.&nbsp; There was just an apartment like this featured in the New York Times Real Estate Section under the slide show.&nbsp; The apt is on Eldridge Street and is about $350k.&nbsp; Not something I would ever want to buy into, but it was fun living like that in college!

				Going a bit off topic here, but I thought Iâ€™d post anyway because it involves tenement apartments, the Lower East Side and gentrification, and who doesnâ€™t love to read on gentrification? &nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><strong>The New York Timesâ€™</strong> City Room Blog recently had an entry on the topic of gentrification and the Lower East Side. &nbsp;The blog entry is a sort of recap on a recent discussion that had been organized by historians in order to address the topic of the LES and its transformation from what once was considered a landing spot for recently arrived poor immigrants, to what it is today.<br /><br />As many of us know, some of the tenement apartments on the LES have undergone major renovations and now are marketed to an entirely different demographic. &nbsp;An example from the entry mentions $3500 for the same apartment once occupied by poor immigrants. &nbsp;Well, at that price, I hope it&#039;s not entirely the same apartment.<br /><br />Gentrification can get ugly. &nbsp;A panelist that took part in the organized discussion is quoted as stating that new residents have amnesia because theyâ€™re not in touch with the historic roots of their current dwellings. &nbsp;However, in the comments section, he goes on to say that his words were misstated. &nbsp;Another panelist said that the LESâ€™ history is what may be drawing high income newcomers to the area. <br />&nbsp;<br />I have to admit that todayâ€™s LES is much different from the LES of my childhood, but is this area really becoming a hot spot for the rich? &nbsp;Hmmmmmâ€¦â€¦.. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Lower East Sideâ€™s Changing Fortunes (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/07/the-lower-east-sides-changing-fortunes/)<br />
