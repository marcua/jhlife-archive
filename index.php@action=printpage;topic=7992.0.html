A Himalayan Yoga workout is both limbering and healing for body, speech, and mind.<br /><br />QUESTIONS?<br />Call the teacher: Suran can be reached at (646) 240-2823.<br />Meet the teacher: Suran will meet with you to discuss your yoga practice and answer any questions. Call her (646) 240-2823 or email suran@suransong.com to schedule a meeting.<br /><br />TEACHER BIO:<br />Since 2008, Suran has taught yoga in diverse settings to a wide range of students of all shapes and ages: from Olympic swimmers at Asphalt Green to Chair Yoga and Bedtop Yoga for senior citizens at Lenox Hill House in Manhattan, in spas such as Couples Swept Away in Jamaica to Canyon Ranch Resort in Arizona, from after-school programs in private schools on the Upper East Side to public schools in East New York, from settings such as churches like Middle Collegiate Church to neighborhood stores like JH Laundromat. She is also certified as an Elementary School Teacher, Grades 1-6, and as an Art Specialist, K-12 through a consortium of Parsons School of Design, Teacherâ€™s College, and Bank Street. Suran really enjoys teaching.<br /><br />Suran Song is a visual artist who, in 1999 when she took her first yoga class in Princeton, could not bend to touch her knees without tightness. Upon moving to New York City in 2002 she found Himalayan Yoga. Because Himalayan Yoga is transmitted with a strong visual art component, she found it instantly recognizable, which had not been the case in her previous encounters of yoga taught by dancers and gymnasts. In 2004, she undertook an intensive three-year Himalayan teacher-training course, one-to-one with her Guru, where she studied the classical sun-salute forms A, B, C, and D and poses in Sanskrit through the lens of body, speech, and mind: anatomy of movement, art of energy management, and loving-kindness meditation with the emphasis of yoga not only as limbering aerobic exercise, but also as holistic therapy for healing.<br /><br />Her video bio is available courtesy of Ogilvy http://suransong.com/videobio.html
