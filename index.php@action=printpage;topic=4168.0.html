				<strong>www.jhrealestatereport.com</strong><br /><br />As a result of questions raised by anxious buyers and sellers, I undertook a research project to determine how our local market â€“ the 11372 zip code - has actually performed.&nbsp; The result is my quarterly <strong>Jackson Heights Real Estate Report</strong>, which analyzes the number of transactions, dollar sales volume, and average sales price for one-, two- and three-family houses, and cooperative and condominium apartments.&nbsp; The latest report covers the fourth quarter of 2009, however, the data I analyze goes as far back as 2003.<br /><br />My Jackson Heights Real Estate Report is available free of charge.&nbsp; Subscribers will automatically receive the latest report four times a year.&nbsp; Simply go to <strong>www.jhrealestatereport.com</strong>, provide me with your email address, and I will forward the report to you.<br /><br />This report extends my knowledge of our community, from its origins â€“ as chronicled in my book <strong>Jackson Heights â€“ A Garden in the City </strong> â€“ to the present day.&nbsp; My perspective is unmatched, so if you are interested in buying or selling residential property, please feel free to call upon meâ€¦. The trusted expert for properties in Historic Jackson Heights.<br /><br />I am also willing to develop customized reports for and meet with the Boards of Directors of cooperative and condominium apartment buildings who would like to know more about our local real estate market and how it affects them.&nbsp; Let me put my knowledge to work for you.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Associate Broker<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />www.jhrealestatereport.com<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thanks for this.&nbsp; I&#039;m singing up now ... it&#039;s good to see unmatched perspective ... and as a long time resident and co-op owner in 3 courts (not all at once), it seems a handy tool.

				Thanks for asking...&nbsp; I issued my first quarter 2010 report last week.&nbsp; The report has been &quot;improved&quot; and now provides an analysis of properties within and outside the Jackson Heights Historic District, and looks at closings - by apartment size - for the original Queensboro built cooperatives (from Laurel Court through The Towers) as far back as 2003.&nbsp; You can obtain a copy of my first quarter 2010 report by subscribing at www.jhrealestatereport.com<br /><br />A quick summary for the 11372 zip code:<br /><br />Houses:&nbsp; While the number of sales rose (albeit off of a very low level), average sales prices continued to decline<br /><br />Apartments: The number of sales declined compared to the year-ago and prior quarters, although prices remained relatively stable<br /><br />The spring selling season has been somewhat muted.&nbsp; The end of the Federal tax credit may have pulled some demand forward.<br /><br />All of the details by property type (one-, two- and three-family houses, prewar and postwar coops, and condominiums) can be found in the first quarter report.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Beaudoin Realty Group<br />www.jhrealestatereport.com
