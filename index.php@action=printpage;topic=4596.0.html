				The NY Daily News will be doing an article on the soon-to-open dog park, and will is sending a photographer over today at 5:30 - as this park has always been a community effort, we&#039;d love to have those who can make it this afternoon join us with their dogs!<br /><br />We&#039;ve got more details here: http://jhdogs.ning.com/events/photoop-for-the-daily-news-at (http://jhdogs.ning.com/events/photoop-for-the-daily-news-at) <br />And if you can, RSVP on the dog park site, so we&#039;ll have an idea of how many people to expect!<br /><br />(I&#039;ll also have a stack of membership applications/park rules with me)<br />

				Thanks to all who showed up - the article is expected to come out on Tuesday. <br /><br />It seemed clear that these dozen (or so) dogs wanted to play with each other, and really had no interest whatsoever in posing for the camera! <br />

				Thank you to all who have done their part concerning JHCREW and the dog park. My husband and dog Betty will be joining and taking part in helping maintain it.... since we will be using it! I&#039;m excited to be part of this pet friendly community, the dog park being the only thing lacking when we moved here in 2008. <br />

				I am really excited about having a park for my dog to run around in and I thank all those who worked so hard to make this happen.&nbsp; I just finished looking at the application and rules and am very confused about one thing though.&nbsp; One of the rules states that no kids under 12 years old are allowed in the park.&nbsp; Does that mean unaccompanied?&nbsp; I have a 6 year old son, he will be out of school in another month.&nbsp; Does that mean I can&#039;t take my dog there all summer while my son is with me?&nbsp; I can understand if the children are not with an adult, but if they are with an adult why would they not be allowed to enter the park?&nbsp; ???

				This was something that was decided on at our last meeting, and voted on by all attending to approve as a part of the overall park rules list - although this, like many of the rules we have, are certainly subject to change. Part of the concern was that many have been in dog parks with children with very inattentive parents (reading, texting, on the phone, talking with friends) and seen children running around essentially unsupervised, sometimes engaging with large dogs in potentially dangerous ways. However, your point is certainly a valid one. <br /><br />We fully expect to refine and customize our rules for our park (since it&#039;s not a city-run dog park, we can change our own rules when we deem necessary) and if this is something you feel strongly about, we should certainly open up for discussion. We don&#039;t have any future rules meetings planned, but I&#039;m sure that soon after we open the park, we will absolutely do so to adjust our park rules to fit our park.&nbsp; We&#039;ll continue to make sure everyone signed up for the website (http://jhdogs.ning.com (http://jhdogs.ning.com)) knows about upcoming meetings, and have an opportunity to raise any concerns ahead of time if they will not be able to attend. <br /><br /><br />

				I was feeling the same way.... I am basically a single parent so if those rule stay in effect I will never be able to use the park. I understand the worry of parents not paying attention but if we have to sign the rules can we not have something that states children must not be running around and parents must be fully attentive. Also a waiver that states the park is not liable?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=4596.msg30484.html#msg30484">Quote from: zrod on May 12, 2010, 01:57:45 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am really excited about having a park for my dog to run around in and I thank all those who worked so hard to make this happen.&nbsp; I just finished looking at the application and rules and am very confused about one thing though.&nbsp; One of the rules states that no kids under 12 years old are allowed in the park.&nbsp; Does that mean unaccompanied?&nbsp; I have a 6 year old son, he will be out of school in another month.&nbsp; Does that mean I can&#039;t take my dog there all summer while my son is with me?&nbsp; I can understand if the children are not with an adult, but if they are with an adult why would they not be allowed to enter the park?&nbsp; ???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I agree with camh.&nbsp; As it is now, basically I can&#039;t use the park.&nbsp; I won&#039;t join and pay the fee if I can&#039;t use it and therefore will not be privy to meetings, etc.&nbsp; While I totally understand where you are coming from as far as inattentive parents, there are also very attentive parents out there as well (as I believe myself to be) and I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s fair to lump all kids and parents into one group.&nbsp; There should be some way to come to a happy medium so everyone can use the park whether you have children or not.&nbsp; The way the rules are now, anyone with children can&#039;t use the park.

				I would like to join the chorus of parents.&nbsp; As one of many moms and dads at home with a child and a dog, I&#039;ve been ecstatically looking forward to joining this dog run.&nbsp; This rule effectively means I would need a babysitter in order to get my dog his well-deserved off-leash time.&nbsp; What a huge disappointment that we would be unable to use the dog run to get some air during the day.&nbsp; Please reconsider the rule to address the responsibility of the parent (ie Children must be attended to at all times, the dog run is not liable), instead of an outright ban.&nbsp; This seems like it would also be in keeping with the tone of personal responsibility outlined in most of the other rules.
