				Pre-COVID there were several places that sold frozen momos in the neighborhood. Does anyone know if they are still available?

				This doesn&#039;t address the original question, but if people are still looking for Chinese groceries, this is a list that mentions a few places in Woodside and Elmhurst that are open:<br /><br /><strong>NYC Chinese Supermarket Closure March/April 2020</strong><br /><br />https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1zcMeOqeNeX0aeY807KESo2Ytq3sIaeCiKWfWOXRfbDQ/htmlview#

				Food Express at 3939 63rd St. Woodside was open yesterday (gloves and masks) and seemed fairly well stocked, though I wasn&#039;t looking for momos. H &amp; F had a long line to enter.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Was there a big line at Food Express? What time did you go to H &amp; F? I usually go in the morning, only downside is the lack of seafood as they&#039;re just getting setup.

				No line at Food Express but they had the shutters up except for the side street entrance and it wasn&#039;t obvious they were open, so people may not have caught on yet. <br /><br />I was there around noon, don&#039;t remember exactly. No fish, and Key Food (whatever it&#039;s called) didn&#039;t either, though I got some there last Friday. I read that the fishing industry has been&nbsp; clobbered because of the restaurants being closed.<br /><br />I really miss my usual source, Top Line on Broadway - always best price and the quality seems the same as other places. Miss the people too! I did get some similar when they were sold out of what I wanted at that big new market, but then they closed and I don&#039;t know if they reopened. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thank you. I went today. Not too bad. 15 minutes wait, but definitely less selections (especially seafood) than Flushing, but I&#039;m not complaining since the wait is less painful.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19868.msg99037.html#msg99037">Quote from: hagsrus on April 24, 2020, 11:26:52 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No line at Food Express but they had the shutters up except for the side street entrance and it wasn&#039;t obvious they were open, so people may not have caught on yet. <br /><br />I was there around noon, don&#039;t remember exactly.
