					Hagsrus, A year back, I was at the Home Depot light when an old woman got decked by a car. Head injury and bleeding. Waited for EMS with her, and a bunch of other concerned folks. Terrifying. And on 37th and 92nd, a mom and her two kids jaywalked around a double parked car only to get smashed into a black car driving across the double line to get by...they all went to Elmhurst that day. A cyclist on 85th and Roosevelt got knocked out of her shoes, and she may have even been permanently injured or died, I didn&#039;t stay as I had my tot with me. These are the injuries that aren&#039;t taken into account in most statistics...the little 7 year old rammed by a car at the bus stop on Northern and 48th? She has a scull fracture, and a long, slow recovery ahead of her...springtime in rehab relearning things. <br /><br />So many near misses- and people don&#039;t get the fact that it&#039;s luck alone, when you don&#039;t take street safety and street redesign seriously. Now, I&#039;ve resorted to yelling at drivers and pedestrians. Well, friendly yelling. Texting, blocking an intersection...creeping your car up while you look for directions? No! Trying to outrun the Q47 as it breezes up 35th? Crazy! <br /><br />I went and checked out the intersection where the woman was just killed by the Q53 last week. It is a major jaywalking spot. With good cause, there should be crosswalks in completely different places than there are. And fence style barriers... I asked an MTA bus supervisor how the Q53 driver was doing...I know that driver wasn&#039;t&nbsp; at fault- The MTA supervisor almost cried, and said Not good...Hopefully Congressman Crowley, who sponsored the original transportation study there will hear the pleas of a desperate woman...I really, really hope Danny Dromm is at that Town Hall tomorrow.

					Please join Congressman Crowley, Assemblymember Moya, Council Members, and Make Queens Safer for a Pedestrian SafetyTown Hall this Sunday from 4-6PM. <br /><br />&nbsp;It will be at the Renaissance School. <br /><br />We have invited Reps from the 115 Precinct, the 108, DOT, DOE, Transportation Alternatives, and hopefully some PTA&#039;s or School Principals and hope that a series of questions and answers will help our community figure out how to Make Queens Safer. <br /><br /><br /><br />Our group, MQS has a focus on education. We don&#039;t understand why the Dept. of Ed wasn&#039;t included in the Mayor&#039;s Plan for Vision Zero. School safety is important, and our kids&#039; first steps to learning, should be safe first steps to school. <br /><br /><br /><br />Beyond that, there are issues of street re-design, safe routes, slow zones and the ever important need to educate both drivers and pedestrians about how to practice street safety. <br /><br /><br /><br />If you have questions, or even better, if you have answers, please join us. <br />

					<br /><br />Hi. A few weeks have passed since our Three Children Too Many March brought attention to the lack of police enforcement, and street calming devices in our neighborhood. The families we honored, who suffered the loss of a child due to reckless driving have received some of the attention they deserve in City politics and policy making. We are gearing up to a bigger campaign and invite you to follow us on facebook. The group is called Make Queens Safer. We will be working with Assemblyman Moya, and Council Members Dromm and Ferraras in the coming months in order to be in the forefront of the Pedestrian Safety movement that is coming to NYC. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Offer your suggestions, cite what needs fixing, or simply follow along, as we work to keep our loved ones safe on our streets and in our community. <br /><br />Thanks. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/makequeenssafer" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/makequeenssafer</a><br />

					Please feel free to share this info with contacts who might be interested. <br /><br />Jackson Heights/Corona- Alarmed and outraged by the tragic death of innocent children run over by cars, dozens of Jackson Heights and Corona residents will march to reduce pedestrian deaths by 1) demanding increased New York City Police Department enforcement of traffic laws; 2) demanding 20 mile per hour speed limits and traffic calming infrastructure to protect all pedestrians 3) involving our entire community in changing laws and increasing local action to save pedestrian lives. <br /><br />Join Us 11/12/13, as we March and Rally for safer streets and honor the families...our neighbors, who have had their kids killed by reckless driving. Personally, some days&nbsp; I know its just luck that separates me from those families who have lost loved ones due to reckless driving. I think we have a&nbsp; better chance than mere luck. That we can improve the amount of enforcement the NYPD does in these neighborhoods...Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst. The concept of Vision Zero, meaning eliminating deaths from traffic may be the second biggest deciding factor on which our next Police Commissioner will be chosen. <br />To RSVP, or learn more about where we&#039;re coming from check out our event page on facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/484223118352033/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/events/484223118352033/</a><br /><br />A separate Three Children Too Many group page is also there, with more articles and posts. <br />Thanks all! <br /><br />Thank you! <br /><br /><em>similar topics merged by moderator</em>

					We aim to educate all facets of road users on how to be safe. The AAA foundation for safety has free pamphlets that you can order and distribute. I&#039;ve ordered my share. I&#039;m dropping them off at Senator Peralta&#039;s office, and libraries. <br />Here&#039;s a link-<br /><br /><a href="https://www.aaafoundation.org/store/23" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.aaafoundation.org/store/23</a><br /><br />Those titled Road Rage, and Peligro en Camino could really use a read around here.

					Yes, what&#039;s funny about this video is that Clarence counts those who signal, even if they only signal halfway through the turn. <br />Lets hope for a sequel to this: Red light runners on 34th Ave.

					That&#039;s the spirit! The New York Spirit!<br />2 murders occur in a very short time, and it seems like a good place for a plaza! <br />I absolutely do think it is an excellent place, and an excellent time for this!!<br />Just not sure how it would play in Buffalo. Nevertheless, I love this great city, and really like our little neighborhood too. <br /><br />Thanks BID, Julissa, and all the folks who made it happen. Manystations in Woodside have beautiful plazas beneath them. It&#039;s out time.

					<br /><br />Hi Neighbors, <br /><br />A bunch of us are in the early organizing stages for a March, entitled &quot;Three Children too Many&quot; pedestrian injuries and death in our neighborhood. Information on that will be forthcoming in the next day or so. Please join us, it is important. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />As I was researching things for the March, I came across a Meeting scheduled for Tomorrow to be held at Make the Road New York. I found the flyer at the Community Board 3 meeting on Thursday, and wanted to check a few things out before I posted. Here is the info from the flyer...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Do you need recreational space for Children? <br /><br />Are cars speeding through your blocks? <br /><br />How can you make your street safe and more comfortable??<br /><br />Play Streets<br /><br />Speed Cameras for school zones<br /><br />Street Design Improvements<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Let&#039;s mobilize your community to create safer, healthier and more vibrant streets. <br /><br />Tuesday, 10/22<br /><br />4 to 6PM. <br /><br />Make the Road New York<br /><br />92-10 Roosevelt Ave <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes!! Yes!!! Yes!!! I say...Let&#039;s get it all. But, it is so difficult to get information, this meeting would be perfect for us as a community. So, I contacted Transportation Alternatives and they will do this meeting again in November. If anyone can attend tomorrow, please do. There is a lot happening in Jackson Heights and we need to be aware of it, in order to be a part of the solutions! <br /><br />For example, did you know-<br /><br />*We can try to get funds and resources to have Northern Blvd deemed a &quot;Congested Corridor&quot;<br /><br />*Three schools in our neighborhood have been chosen for the Safe Routes to School program from DOT. Others are considered 2nd tier priority P.S. 69 among them. <br /><br />*JH has been chosen for a neighborhood Slow Zone, but the area currently covered just isn&#039;t big enough<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This is an informational post for you. If you would like to get involved we will be organizing as Three Children too Many. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our first goal is the March, and like I mentioned, someone is going to post about it soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our second goal is campaigning for safer streets, and the meeting mentioned above will really help us create a vision and find the proper resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Please let me know if anyone can make it tomorrow. <br /><br />We will have a separate yahoo group for Three Children too Many, so as not to burden this listserve in the future. <br /><br />Thanks for your time. I hope this interests you all. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Reply
