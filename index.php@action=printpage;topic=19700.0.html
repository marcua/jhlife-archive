				I never liked this place. I found the yogurt to be basically inedible, and the service was unfriendly. Last time I went a few years ago, I discarded the yogurt after taking one bite. Fingers crossed for something better.

				Wouldn&#039;t it be amazing to get something like an Ample Hills here? There&#039;s one in Astoria and it&#039;s cute and old-timey and always packed. We&#039;re definitely missing some quality ice cream in the nabe! Would be great for after school too!

				It was open today around 5pm when I walked by. Or, at least it looked open - seated customers, employee cleaning. For sale sign in the window, though.

				Sorry to say, but this store will be closed and ready for rent pretty soon. It’s tough to put a dream into a business and have to walk away from it. But I very much doubt somebody will be buying this business. Prime location, no key money. What’s good for that corner?&nbsp; I can’t think of anything, no matter how much the investment is, to put on that corner to make money. It’s a very small accommodation.&nbsp; Unless it’s a tax free enterprise, like so many other businesses in this area code, it’s gonna be more of the same.
