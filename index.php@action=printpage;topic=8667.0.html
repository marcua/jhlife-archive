				While accidents like this are tragic, do we really need bike lanes on Queen&#039;s Boulevard???&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a 10-lane highway.&nbsp; Putting in bike lanes would make it more dangerous, and more congested, for everyone.&nbsp; Some people have to face the fact that bike lanes do not belong everywhere.

				We drive along Queens Boulevard to get to/from Trader Joe&#039;s all the time.&nbsp; It is sometimes a chaotic mess at the intersections where cars turn in and off the boulevard.&nbsp; I have also seen cars playing frogger on the multilanes.&nbsp; I would be more concerned about bicyclists getting hurt in this kind of environment.&nbsp;

				but wouldn&#039;t bike lanes help, rather than exacerbate that situation? I mean, bicyclists aren&#039;t going to stop using the thoroughfare, and I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s feasible to actually ban them and issue fines to those who defy the ban.<br /><br />i&#039;m a huge supporter of bike lanes, even though i&#039;m too skittish to ride on major streets in the city for a lot of the reasons mentioned here. even a small cut in traffic is always beneficial, in my opinion.

				I don&#039;t think encouraging additional pedestrian traffic along such a road would be a good idea, rather it would make a dangerous situation more dangerous, and clog a street that is decidedly automobile centric with bikes who are unprotected and vulnerable.&nbsp; The local sections of that road are extremely chaotic as it is, but at least cars and buses have their own armor.<br /><br />Noone seriously would suggest putting bike lanes along the Grand Central Parkway, or LIE, and if there were a biker he/she would certainly be pulled over and fined.&nbsp; Queens Boulevard should be held in the same regard, at least where it turns into a highway-type of street once it passes east of Sunnyside.&nbsp; Some streets are suitable for mixed use, and some simply aren&#039;t.<br /><br />People crossing the boulevard to visit the myriad of stores and malls along it are a different matter, and one not easily solved.&nbsp; Some countries build pedestrian bridges over giant streets like this as a matter of course, and it would probably be a good (and expensive) solution here, both for car-traffic as well as foot-traffic.<br /><br />The automobile genie is out of the bottle in this city thanks to Robert Moses and it isn&#039;t going back down now, and certainly not so in deep Queens.

				I drove along Queens Blvd for only one block this evening and I feel like I almost hit one bicyclist (who was biking the wrong way, facing traffic in the middle fast lane) and about 10 pedestrians, who were ALL crossing against the light when I had a green left turn signal and they had a red do not cross light at the 63rd Rd intersection by the Marshalls.&nbsp; It was a nightmare.&nbsp; I try to avoid driving in the area due to the crazy car traffic, but in this case every single one of the pedestrians and the crazy bicyclist were engaging in very unsafe behavior.&nbsp; All this occurred after dark.

				Slightly off topic because they&#039;ve occurred on 34th Ave and 37th Ave, but while walking WITH the light I have just missed being hit by 4 bikers in the last week.<br /><br />Most of the bikers on those avenues show no respect for pedestrians and run lights all the time. Particularly 34th Ave.<br />

We have a car we drive every once in a while, and while I am not saying it&#039;s all their fault, but I have seen SO MANY pedestrians crossing against lights. Sometimes just poking along across the street with the gall to look at me like &quot;F YOU&quot; as they cross when my light is green. I truly think the pedestrians are more problem than the drivers in my experience. The education needs to go both ways..<br /><br />Also, that article. I don&#039;t like how they say &quot;driver mowed down two pedestrians&quot; when it might not have even been his fault. It&#039;s almost like it&#039;s written with a slant toward the driver being at fault with zero evidence. A little objectivity in tone would have been nice, but that doesn&#039;t generate clicks I guess.

				hfm, I don&#039;t disagree with you.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a lot of reckless, distracted and absentminded people out there.&nbsp; But in addition to the pedestrians you&#039;ve been observing, these descriptions also apply to some drivers.&nbsp; We need to re-engineer our streets to be more forgiving of mistakes by both drivers and pedestrians.&nbsp; And we need to reform our policing and legal systems to ensure there are mechanisms to get the most dangerous of these drivers off the road.<br /><br />Queens Boulevard has proven over the years to be a particularly dangerous location -- for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike.&nbsp; We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remake it to be safer for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks to years of advocacy efforts, the city is considering a $100 million investment in Queens Boulevard (http://www.streetsblog.org/2015/03/05/de-blasio-commits-250-million-to-arterial-redesigns-but-how-far-will-it-go/) -- Saturday&#039;s march and rally will keep up the pressure for a significant transformation of the corridor.

				A workshop will be held this evening at JFK school to discuss the 2nd phase of the Queens Blvd redesign, which will extend the pedestrian and bike improvements from 73rd to the area around Queens Center Mall. <br />The first phase has been successful, and nothing dire has happened in the way of increased congestion or slower travel times for motorists. <br /><br />Please take a minute to add your comments to this interactive map. There is also a survey you could fill out. And, of course, the meeting itself. <br />http://www.nycdotfeedbackportals.nyc/queens-blvd/queens-boulevard-2016-74-street-eliot-avenue<br /><br />57-12 94th St. <br />7-9 pm. <br /><br />Please note that safety improvements along Northern Blvd, including pedestrian islands, turn lanes, changes to the signal timing and increased awareness on all parts has led to true safety. In 2013, we mourned the loss of 4 children killed in traffic along Northern- and we&#039;ve not experienced that since. Hallelujah!

				So now we&#039;ll have more dead bicyclists to join all the pedestrians on the Boulevard of Death? And more pedestrians being hit by cyclists who think traffic laws and right of way don&#039;t apply to them?<br /><br />Horrible idea until the Boulevard is redesigned properly to function as a major arterial road while still safe for pedestrians.<br />

				&quot;Horrible idea until the Boulevard is redesigned properly to function as a major arterial road while still safe for pedestrians.&quot;<br /><br />@JHresident: I think this is exactly the idea, to redesign it and make it safer and more friendly to pedestrians and cyclists. If they manage to follow the drawings on the plan, it will probably look very nice.<br /><br />
