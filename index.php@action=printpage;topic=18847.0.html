				Question -- is he also going to introduce a law that compels bike riders to actually USE the bike lane where one if made available?&nbsp; Because one of the issues I&#039;ve faced is having to drive down a newly narrow road with a bike lane, and bike riders are both to my right (properly in the lane) and to my left, so there&#039;s no room for a car to actually drive.&nbsp; Also, does this bill increase police enforcement to prevent people from double-parking, which would necessarily mean that any driver that wants to move forward has to use the bike lane to go around the car?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				The proposed bill specifically talks about protected bike lanes, but how would a car drive on a protected lane?&nbsp; Is this actually a problem?

The bill doesn&#039;t really define protected bike lanes, but the DOT defines them as &quot;A protected bike lane is a path intended for the use of bicycles that is physically separated from motorized vehicle traffic by an open space, vertical delineation, or barrier.‚Äù Virtually no bicycles use the protected Lanes on Queens Blvd, probably because these are so poorly engineered that they are more of a hazard for riders than any kind of protection.,

				They destroyed that stretch of Queen&#039;s Boulevard.&nbsp; It&#039;s the worst traffic planning I&#039;ve ever seen. :(

				Good for him. People are constantly parking cars in bike lanes, blocking them and creating very unsafe conditions.&nbsp; Thank you, Assemblyperson DenDekker!
