			I hear some people talk about this in passing and I was wondering when this happend, &amp; what were the stores that burned down, resulting in the current office complex/parking lot/Rite Aid.<br /><br />Were all the stores on that side of the street one story high as the other is?

			I believe the block that you are referring to was all one story,&nbsp; all pre war architecture.&nbsp; There were several mom and pops stores.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only one that I now remember was a really nice stationary store. Before the area was landmarked there were two fires.&nbsp; One which partially burnt down the block---as a warning--- and an other one soon&nbsp; followed that burnt down everything in its&#039; entirety.&nbsp; Although I can not personally attest to this, rumor had it that they were purposefully destroyed to make way for the monstrosity that currently exist. I remember speaking to the owner of the stationary store at the time and this is what he had told me.&nbsp; The block was low density and very quaint.

			Three of the stores that burned were all favorites of mine:<br /><br />The Continental Restaurant was exactly that a nice Continental Restaurant with a nice bar.<br />Mike&#039;s Deli was a deli where you could order a sandwich or hot food and sit in a booth and eat in.<br />Glendale Bake Shop - was on the 82nd Street side and in addition to being a nice bakery had a nice deli section.<br />

			I think there was also a camera store there. Oldst yle, they sold all types of film, developed pictures, and repaired cameras.
