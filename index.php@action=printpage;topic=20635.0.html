				i&#039;ve noticed a group of teens riding their bikes, doing tricks up an down 78th street between 34th and 35th avenue.<br /><br />that block has little traffic due to 34th ave being closed so they are racing quite recklessly down the block (going the wrong) way.&nbsp; i saw one almost hitting a car that was coming up the block.<br /><br />is there anything that can be done about it?

				This is the beauty of being young and a teen.<br /><br />You only have to think of having dangerous fun.<br /><br />And if you survive your teen years, you get to grow up and tell the new teens not to do it.<br /><br />

				The bikes are a minor annoyance, but they sometimes pull the barricade around the corner, block off 78th Street completely, and are occasionally joined by unlicensed dirt bike rider(s).

				These kids are riding on a street with almost no traffic, yet somehow this is thought of as dangerous? <br />&quot;Almost hitting a car&quot; <br />What does that even mean? One of them came close to a car? That&#039;s a pretty common occurrence for anyone who rides a bicycle, yet somehow we don&#039;t have an epidemic of bicyclists just crashing into cars. <br />We have people driving driving in the neighborhood like maniacs (speeding, failure to yield, running red lights, barely stopping for stop signs, regularly on a daily basis, but this is what you think is dangerous?<br />

They are annoying af, and seem to have way too much attitude for their own good, but they are harmless for the most part. A couple will likely find out what it means to play stupid games and win stupid prizes.<br /><br />I&#039;m convinced that most of the people driving around here should have their licenses revoked. Something really should be done about the idiots on the dirt bikes.<br />
