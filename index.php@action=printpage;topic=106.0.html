				My wife and I are new to the area and are curious if there are any local places where dog owners go for their pups to socialize . We have been driving to McGolrick park in Greenpoint, which is nicely maintained if you don&#039;t mind the occasional drunk passed out on a park bench. Given how dog friendly Jackson Heights is I am really hoping there is close by.

				Unfortunately, it seems that Jackson Heights doesn&#039;t have any place for dogs to socialize yet.&nbsp; What some folks opt to do is gather at Travers Park in the evenings (cemented areas) with their dogs.&nbsp; There have been issues in the past due to parents complaining of unleashed dogs in the children&#039;s areas during the summer months, but most dog owners go later in the evenings when there are no children in the playground.&nbsp; Cleanup issues have also arisen in the past.<br /><br />I remember reading not too long ago about there being a dog walk down 35th Ave., near the 70th/69th Street ramp that leads onto the highway.&nbsp; Anyone have info on that?

				I, too am interested in this. Apparently Travers Park is dog friendly after 9pm and before 9am.<br /><br />Other than that we haven&#039;t found any place local. There is supposed to be a dog run opening nearby, but I have yet to hear of a consistent location for this, other than somewhere near the BQE.

				I&#039;m a dog owner as well and I would love to see a dog run in the neighborhood. Can we petition to have a dedicated area created in Travers Park? Are there other places in the Neighborhood that would work as a dog run? It seems with so many pet owners we would be able to make something happen.

				I think there is a dog run in the east part of Woodside, on Queens Boulevard near the BQE.<br />Also, there is a plan to build a dog run in Torsney park in Sunnyside. The site is very similar to Travers Park in Jackson Heights. It consists of basketball courts and a playground and is about the same size.<br />All we have to do is put together a proposal for the community board and all show up to the CB meetings to support the idea.<br />http://www.sudsmutts.com/index.php/Dog-Park<br />Also it would be a good idea to form an organization like SUDS to promote dogs and cleaning up after them and so on. I propose that the name of such an org should be &quot;Jackson Hounds&quot;!<br />

				According to Urban Hound, there&#039;s a small dog run located in Woodside at Doughboy Plaza.&nbsp; The site states that the run is so clean, that it&#039;s even questionable if any dogs are actually using it. <br /><br />http://ny.urbanhound.com/houndPlay/dogRuns.asp

				We went to the Woodside dog run last weekend. It&#039;s tiny and dangerous. There are large cement outcroppings and their was another dog there that was terrorizing our small Boston Terrier.<br /><br />This weekend we went instead to Central Park (no dog runs at all) and then to Riverside Drive and 72nd Street (a much cleaner, larger and safer dog run) and he had a blast.<br />It&#039;s so unfortunate that we have to go so far away for him to be able to socialize and run around.

				Does anyone know if there&#039;s a doggy day care service in the Jackson Heights area? I&#039;m hoping to move into Jackson Heights this summer, but the caveat for me is the alarming lack of dog-friendliness I&#039;ve encountered. I ask people on the street where they take their dogs to play, and most seem to just walk around the nabe. I know about the off-lead hours at Travers Park, and the grassy areas towards the airport, but otherwise there&#039;s not much until they build the dog run (if it ever happens). I started thinking a dog day care might be the happy medium for my pooch, but now I can&#039;t find any such services available in JH. I know they have at least one in Astoria, but that&#039;s too much of a trek without a car. My dog loves to chase balls, and while he can do that before 9 at Travers, I would like to have other options aside from just walks with me or my dog walker. Even if it&#039;s improvised/non official dog play area, any advice would be most appreciated.

				guvner, the short answer is no.&nbsp; But read the thread called Dog owners.&nbsp; That one talks about all grassy areas, parks and online sites about dog runs etc.<br /><br />here&#039;s the link to jump right to it: http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=106.0<br /><br />Check out&nbsp; 85th and 30th ave. park.&nbsp; There&#039;s a grassy area past the childrens section.&nbsp; And you&#039;ll read about the grassy areas over by 77th and 30th or 25th... anyway good luck.

				guvner, unfortunately I haven&#039;t been able to track down any (reliable) doggy day care facilities here in JH. I have to take my dog into Manhattan for doggy day care and boarding. I don&#039;t know what I would do if he was too big to get on the subway.<br /><br />Re: dog runs... Luckily, my building has a dog run out back which is great for ball playing and off-leash milling around (and is one of the reasons why I moved in). However, it still doesn&#039;t offer the socialization factor of the public dog runs available in other neighborhoods -- ever since I moved in, I&#039;ve never been in the dog run with anyone other than my dog. Again, I schlep my dog into Manhattan so that he can socialize at public dog runs. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also found that many people for whatever reason (unsocialized dogs, no time, etc.) don&#039;t like to stop and let their dogs &quot;say hello&quot; to each other. Many people that I&#039;ve encountered with big dogs say that their dogs are &quot;unfriendly&quot; and have actually crossed the street to avoid letting their dog(s) near my dog. If I do say so myself, my dog is very well-behaved on walks and approaches other dogs with tentative caution (then warms up if the other dog is friendly), so it&#039;s not like they&#039;re trying to avoid a small, yappy, jumping dog. Point is, while you should always be cautious about approaching unknown dogs, it seems that you should take extra caution in JH if the other owners haven&#039;t been proactive about it already. Perhaps if there was a place for dogs to socialize (a dog run!),&nbsp; there wouldn&#039;t be so many dogs in the neighborhood that haven&#039;t been properly socialized and this wouldn&#039;t be an issue. Don&#039;t mean to generalize here but it&#039;s just my experience walking my dog around the neighborhood anytime between 7pm and 10pm. There are plenty of wonderful friendly dogs and owners in JH too!

				You confirmed what I was thinking which was that it was possible that there could be garden areas for dogs if you found the right building. My dog&#039;s too big to take via subway. He&#039;s totally socialized, has been in the dog run since he was 5 months old (we live a block from Madison Sq. Park right now). I occasionally notice that vibe you mention about how people are afraid to greet other dogs near my place now.

				If it&#039;s helpful, I know that Fillmore Hall and Griswold Hall both have private dog runs. I&#039;ve heard that the boards of both buildings have considered (and/or are considering) doing away with them but that there is opposition from residents (at least at Fillmore) because the dog runs are used fairly frequently. Perhaps others can chime in if their buildings have dog runs.

The people with dogs get to keep their dogs.&nbsp; But when a dog dies - that person cannot get a new dog.<br /><br />But even with the grandfather laws, if a shareholder is in constant violation of the House Rules concerning their dogs (and our rules are extensive) then they get penalized as a shareholder.&nbsp; By law you can&#039;t take away their dog BUT they can lose their proprietary lease.&nbsp; So it&#039;s keep your apartment or get rid of your dog. We&#039;re talking EXTREME cases of rule violation here not every day stuff.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine it would ever happen but the House Rules protect the co-op, the shareholders&#039; right to peaceful enjoyment of the place and our rules even protect the dogs from bad owners.&nbsp; (If that were to be the case.)

				I was a founding member of the little dog run in Woodside, however due to political pressure and not enough assertion on the dog owners&#039; part, the run was moved to the side of the park and is too small for anything other than a toy-size breed. It also sits on a slight incline. <br /><br />There is an unofficial little dog park on 34th and 60-something as mentioned by other posters.&nbsp; For those with a car there, is a wonderful and HUGE one on the service road of the Grand Central in Forest Hills. Well fenced, with benches and enough room for many large dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another good one is in Cunningham Park just off Union Turnpike and I think 183rd but I will double check if anyone is interested.&nbsp; Forest Park also has one but I have not been to it.<br /><br />Urbanhound.com has info...and the parks department requires an organization committed to cleaning and policing before they will create one. There are so many great locations in Flushing Meadows.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				The New York Times has an article on Doughboy Plaza, the small dog run located in Woodside.&nbsp; From the looks of it, the writer gives it the thumbs down, but his dog seems to like it when there are other dogs around to play with.&nbsp; There&#039;s also mention of the much larger Sherry Park dog run that&#039;s located on Queens Blvd. by the entrance to the BQE.<br /><br /><strong>The New York Times</strong><br />Dog Day Afternoons (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/nyregion/thecity/10dogs.html?ref=thecity)<br />By DAN SALTZSTEIN<br />Published: August 9, 2008 <br /><br />THE dog run at 56th Street and Woodside Avenue in Woodside, Queens, is, frankly, a disgrace to dog runs everywhere. Tucked away behind Public School 11 in an elevated corner of Doughboy Plaza, itâ€™s less a dog run than a small, squarish pit of dust.<br /><br />The site boasts the boilerplate sign â€” â€œRules of the Runâ€ â€” which indicates an official New York dog run. But other than some shade on hot, sunny days and an overstuffed garbage can that appears to be emptied every week or so, the run has very little going for it.<br /><br />The ground is covered with dirt from which odd pieces of concrete and metal mysteriously protrude here and there. There is no hose or water supply, only a baby-blue plastic bowl that can be filled at a water fountain about 40 yards away. Given the nature of the terrain, the many gates to be opened and the trickle produced by the fountain, filling the bowl is neither easy nor pleasant.<br /><br />Mandy, the 3-year-old black mutt that my wife and I adopted last year, doesnâ€™t appear to hate the Doughboy run as much as I do. She gets to socialize when other dogs visit the run, but that is rare, and as a result, she returns to our apartment covered in dust and still full of energy. When I walk her through Doughboy Plaza, she often pulls toward the dog run, then loses interest when she doesnâ€™t find a playmate. Itâ€™s always a sad moment for us both.<br /><br />Apparently, I am not alone in my feelings about the Doughboy run.<br /><br />â€œOh, this place is awful!â€ a local dog owner told me one day. â€œWe almost never come here.â€ Then she added, â€œHave you been to the one at 65th and Queens Boulevard? Now thatâ€™s a dog run!â€<br /><br />On a recent Saturday, we decided to seek out this Dog Run of Eden. However, when we made our way to the intersection to which we had been directed, things did not look good. We found ourselves at the junction of Queens Boulevard and the entrance to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. This neither looked nor sounded like the ideal place for a dog run.<br /><br />We crossed Queens Boulevard. We crossed back. I called 311, the cityâ€™s official help number, but the very pleasant woman who answered didnâ€™t seem to have access to a dog-run database. A Web search on my Treo yielded a map on the parks department site displaying a big block of green called Sherry Park. All we saw was highway. Then we spotted the run, which was, in fact, right where Queens Boulevard meets the B.Q.E.<br /><br />Iâ€™d pictured the park as bursting with nature. Not just green, but covered in grass (or at least wood chips), with a profusion of trees for shade. Being a relatively new dog owner, I wondered if this expectation was based on repeated viewings of â€œThe Dog Whisperer,â€ which is set in Los Angeles. In L.A., or at least on the show, dog runs are huge spaces and very green.<br /><br />At least there were dogs. Sherry Park, as it turns out, is a large expanse of concrete, perhaps five or six times the size of the Doughboy run, and set far enough back from the street that the noise from the highways isnâ€™t terribly noticeable. A bunch of dogs immediately ran up to us, and within a few minutes, Mandy was frolicking happily.<br /><br />The only green area was a small slope at the back of Sherry Park, which the dogs didnâ€™t seem particularly interested in, and the weeds that invariably flourish amid urban concrete. <br /><br />MANDY is an obsessive sniffer, and nothing grabs her interest as much as unusual plants. She licks tall grass and loves to bury her face in leafy weeds. Still, she didnâ€™t seem bothered by the concrete. Upon arriving at the dog run, she immediately started wiggling and hopping around, the way she does when she is excited. In fact, all the dogs visiting Sherry Park that day seemed more playful and at ease than the ones Iâ€™d seen at the Doughboy run.<br /><br />Sitting at one of three shaded concrete tables, each of which had a built-in chessboard, was Raquel Leon, 25, of Woodside. Ms. Leon was visiting Sherry Park for the first time with her father, whom I had met at the Doughboy run with Draco, the familyâ€™s golden retriever. Ms. Leon summed up the differences between the runs. â€œThey donâ€™t really like it,â€ she said of dogsâ€™ reactions to the Doughboy run. â€œThey need space.â€<br /><br />Debbie Phelan, who was accompanied by Lucy, her terrier-Lab mix, agreed. â€œItâ€™s well kept here,â€ Ms. Phelan said. â€œPeople look after it.â€<br /><br />And, indeed, as I looked around, I noticed what I first took to be a portable toilet (for humans, presumably), but which turned out to be a tool shed, flanked by gardening implements that at least suggested the possibility of regular upkeep.<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s a pity there arenâ€™t more,â€ Ms. Phelan said of the run. â€œThis is a good one. Well, itâ€™s the only one I know around here, but we like it.â€<br /><br />As our dogs explored and roughhoused, we were joined by Josie Callanan, 37, of Woodside, and her Jack Russell terrier, Jinx, a k a Jinxsie. Ms. Callanan didnâ€™t think much of the Doughboy run, either. â€œItâ€™s too small,â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s not a dog run.â€<br /><br />The day was hot and humid, and as the dogs settled down in the shade of the tables or lapped at the water in one of two metal bowls, my thoughts wandered. Was this as good as it got for the hundreds of dogs in the neighborhood? Were the only options tiny and dusty or big and concrete?<br /><br />Despite the generally positive vibe â€” Mandy was simultaneously panting with fatigue and wiggling with happiness â€” I had to admit that I was disappointed. Then, Ms. Phelan, as if reading my mind, asked: â€œHave you been to Forest Park, out by Woodhaven Boulevard? Great dog run.â€<br /><br />

				Train usually. He doesn&#039;t like the train or the car very much. He&#039;s very smart though (aren&#039;t they all?) and he&#039;s learned to just curl up in a lap (or in the travel carrier) and go to sleep for the duration. He used to have upset stomach problems the first few times we traveled. He hasn&#039;t had problems in 4 months or so, so we think he&#039;s over it now.

				There is soon to be a dog park in Jackson Heights. Actually two! The plans have been developed for individual parks for large dogs and small dogs (at 69th street and 35th avenue) and are going to be constructed in the spring of 2009. I tried to attach the plans, but the file was too large. If you want to see them, or if you know how I can post a larger file, email me (see below for email). The parks will not be huge, but they will be BEAUTIFUL, with different colored gravel, benches, ramps and obstacles for the dogs to play with and explore. Spread the word, so the grand opening of the park will be a great experience for dogs and owners alike. <br /><br />Additionally, the upkeep of the park is up to the users of the park. The plans have been pushed through by a small group of committed dog owners, who would greatly appreciate the help of other caring owners in the area. If you are interested in becoming more involved, please email me at jeffpac09@yahoo.com. <br /><br />Look forward to hearing from, and meeting you.<br />

In fact, I&#039;m afraid that he may have been the culprit who &quot;terrorized&quot; Spanishfish&#039;s small Boston Terrier in April at the Woodside dog run. :embarassed: We had only rescued him a couple of weeks prior &amp; he was amped by meeting other dogs in the freedom that even that dingy little dog run provided. <br /><br />He&#039;s calmed down a bit since then but, at only 18 months old, he still acts like a young puppy at times. It&#039;s not a great shot but here he is in a quieter moment on the ramp at Camp Bow Wow.

				Wow! The plans for the dog run look amazing! I&#039;m on 85th street, I wonder if I could smuggle my cocker spaniel on the bus to get him down there. It could be a good walk on a nice day too!

Given how dog friendly Jackson Heights is I am really hoping there is close by. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />I too wish there was a nice place to exercise my puppy.&nbsp; There is a piece of unused property on Junction Blvd that was supposed to be the home of a Daycare Center.&nbsp; But that never happened.&nbsp; Maybe we could talk to Hiram Monserrate and he could make it happen ... the dog run.<br /><br />Yup, I am going to call his office as soon as he is takes the oath ... sometime in January.&nbsp; It would be either him or Dekker who replaced John Sabini who liked to drive drunk more than he liked staying in office.&nbsp; Go figure<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you know.&nbsp; We should push for what we want and what our puppies need.
