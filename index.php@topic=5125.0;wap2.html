			It wasn&#039;t in Jackson Heights but we used to take the elevated train -- a nickel then -- from 90th St. and Roosevelt to (can&#039;t remember the stop --- was there a Sunnyside stop?) where, for twenty five cents you got a locker, a key (with an elastic band that went around your wrist), and could swim all day... A lot of kids from Jackson Heights went there. The only other pool we knew about was in Whitestone, a long ways off.<br /><br />A girl my age (about 10 or 11) -- her name was Janet -- used to run around the pool and shove me in when I was standing at the edge. I would angrily ask my friend,Jackie Dugan, why she was doing this and he replied that he thought &quot;She&#039;s nuts! She likes you.&quot; &nbsp;Girls matured more quickly than boys in those days. :)

			Hi ercillor.&nbsp; I came across a few vintage photographs posted on the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce website.&nbsp; A couple of the photos included were taken at a pool located in Sunnyside Queens.... perhaps the pool you refer to in your post above?&nbsp; In order to view the pool photos, you have scroll through some others at the site.<br /><br />Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce

			Oh yeah, went there often during summers growing up in Jackson Heights. Ah, but during my earlier years living in Astoria, my sister and I used to take the bus to the Astoria Pool under the Tri-boro Bridge. We practically lived there during the summer months.
