					I&#039;ve been 3 times so far.&nbsp; The vegetarian section of the buffet was delicious and the vegetarian entree I had the first time was so good that I haven&#039;t tried another entree.&nbsp; I can;t remember the name but it was a spinach dish with chickpeas and broccoli inside.&nbsp; Mmmmmm.

					The vegetarian restaurant post got me thinking that maybe there are more than the two vegans I know of in Jackson Heights (myself included).<br /><br />Are you a JH vegan cook?<br /><br />If so are you interested in starting-up a JH vegan dinner club.&nbsp; Something like a vegan pot-luck once a month at revolving apartments.&nbsp; Some people could bring appetizers, others main dishes, others sides, others deserts.<br /><br />I think it would be fun...I make really awesome homemade seitan!

					I&#039;m vegan and I&#039;ve been living here for over 4 years.&nbsp; While I would love to see a veggie restaurant in JH, I&#039;ve even dreamed of opening one myself (a vegan Indian-Latin-Italian-German fusion experiment), but its not going to happen any time soon...I mean we&#039;ve only had a coffee shop with soy milk for a year.<br /><br />On the other hand you can eat vegetarian, even vegan, in JH every night for a month and not double up.&nbsp; Here are some of my favorites:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Mexican - Coatzingo - $2 Veggie tacos are the best meal in JH and are vegetarian, no chicken stock in rice, no lard in beans.&nbsp; This was confirmed in a long Spanish conversation with the cooks.&nbsp; Go vegan - &quot;sin queso, sin crema.&quot;</li><li>Thai - Rice Ave. (and Arunee) - Soy duck is amazing.&nbsp; My favorites are the Crispy Duck Salad (sub soy duck) and the Spicy Basil Noodles with soy duck (no egg, no fish sauce.&nbsp; Nearly everything on the menu is potentially vegan, just order with tofu or soy duck and say &quot;no fish sauce.&quot;</li><li>Sushi - Happy Kitchen - lots of veggie options - love the gyoza, warm noodles, the soups, the green river roll, the spicy tofu crunch roll...</li><li>Indian dining - Delhi Palace - amazing veggie food and plenty of vegan options, just ask what dishes don&#039;t contain ghee, cream, cheese, or butter.</li><li>Indian cheap dosas - Dosa Place - I was distraught when Dimple (my favorite hole in the wall) closed, but the owner reopened a couple doors down where Dosa Diner used to be.&nbsp; Their dosas are amazing, they have on that I swear tastes like buffalo wings.</li><li>Indian - Any other Indian place&nbsp; just ask what dishes don&#039;t contain ghee, cream, cheese, or butter.</li><li>Afghani - Afghan Kabab House #4 - great eggplant and okra.</li><li>Cheap Afghani - that place on the west side of 74th with the tandor in the window.</li><li>Latin - Novo has some amazing veggie items on their menu, the veggie fajitas are delicious.</li><li>Latin - Pio Pio has one of the best and most filling salads around (and I&#039;m more of a hearty fake-meat and pasta kind of vegetarian).</li><li>Cafe - espresso77 makes an ever improving soy cappuccino, soy cream cheese for bagels (not on menu, just ask), and has some nice veggie items on their revolving menu: hummus, roasted eggplant salad, grilled peanut butter and banana on whole wheat!</li><li>Chinese - Nanking Express - Chinese-Indian place with 1/2 of their menu devoted to vegetarian choices.&nbsp; Great soft Chinese style tofu.</li></ul><br />And these are just my favorites, there are many other Indian, Bengali, Pakistani, Peruvian...places that offer unique vegetarian dishes.

					Jackson Heights is getting a new park!<br /><br />City planners met with administration and students at I.S. 145 yesterday.&nbsp; My source (one of my 7th graders who participated in the meeting) said that the the planners discussed building new basketball and handball courts, synthetic grass soccer and baseball fields, benches, fountains, and plants (including trees along Northern Blvd. to block traffic noise).&nbsp; The new schoolyard will be closed when school is in session, then open to the community when school is not in session (after 4:00 PM, weekends, and vacations).&nbsp; While the schoolyard isn&#039;t huge, this project will probably double the amount of field space in the neighborhood.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try to find out more, including the time line for the project from the Principal today.

					I love the anti-plastic bag campaign.<br /><br />I have a canvas bag right here from the Good Food Store in Missoula, MT, it has the Good Food Store logo on one side and 10 advertisements on it from big health/organic product companies on the other.&nbsp; I can definitely imagine a Jackson Heights bag with a JH logo and ads from local businesses.&nbsp; Grocery stores could sell them at the check out counter (next to In Touch Magazine).<br /><br /><img src="http://www.room309online.com/images/bag/front.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /> <img src="http://www.room309online.com/images/bag/back.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br /><br />We could develop an activity or two for elementary and middle school teachers to do with their students to teach them about the benefits of using reusable bags.&nbsp; Thus brainwashed, they would go on to pester their parents until they buy the&nbsp; JH reusable shopping bag.<br /><br />I remember reading recently that Ireland had reduced plastic bag use by 90%(!) by placing a tax on plastic bags and providing canvass alternatives.&nbsp; Could we convince local shops to charge a plastic bag fee?<br /><br />

					80thstreet,<br /><br />I did not mean to give the impression that I support, defend or find justification for the actions of the vandals.&nbsp; Defacing property is certainly criminal, and those caught should face some penalty (although I would not go as far as saying that teenagers should be booked and jailed).&nbsp; <br /><br />I merely wanted to move the discussion away from what I interpreted as the demonization of an entire subpopulation of our neighborhood for the actions of a tiny number of vandals.&nbsp; If this is a legitimate problem then we should be thinking of solutions, not simply complaining.<br /><br />The fact that graffiti remains an issue after the NYPD has spent 30+ years hunting down graffiti artists, tells me that if we want to live in a graffiti free neighborhood we cannot rely on catching and penalizing the vandals. The only other option we have is to clean it as fast as they paint it. I&#039;m offering one plausible way to get that done--enlisting some of the thousands of junior high students living here.&nbsp; At the same time I guess I&#039;m tentatively hoping that bringing kids in as part of the solution will create a certain amount of social pressure against graffiti, eventually reducing the amount of graffiti being produced.&nbsp; That, however, may be no more than wishful thinking.

					I am a teacher who works with the junior high students you refer to in your posts, and I&#039;d like to make a few points and suggest a possible solution.<br /><br />First, the use of &quot;these kids&quot; and &quot;they&quot; implicitly demonizes a large group of <span class="bbc_u"><strong>children</strong></span> in our neighborhood who are at a very impressionable age--one that takes others&#039; opinions very seriously.&nbsp; Kids this age are constantly looking for recognition from their peers, as well as from adults; a suspicious look on the sidewalk or a suggestion that &quot;they get jail time&quot; sends a very clear message: our community does not care about you.&nbsp; We teach children respect from kindergarten on though junior high, but they know that respect is conditional: we innately feel that we are obliged to give respect only when we receive respect in turn.&nbsp; I suspect that building a stronger sense of community between our neighborhoodâ€™s children and adults would foster mutual respect and make <span class="bbc_u"><strong>some</strong></span> potential vandals think twice before defacing public and private property.&nbsp; How to go about this, especially in a crowded neighborhood with very few facilities for community activities (youth sports, youth organizations, etc.) is a topic for another post.<br /><br />Note that I stressed the word â€˜someâ€™ above.&nbsp; We must realize that we cannot eliminate the graffiti problem altogether.&nbsp; Young adolescents have been vandalizing community property since the Stone Age; no doubt some of the more lewd Mesozoic cave painting found in France were the work of angst-ridden teens.&nbsp; While we can strive to provide alternative activities and a rich community life for teens, there will always be a few who do graffiti, egg houses, smash mail boxes, etc.&nbsp; Teenage rebellion is not a modern problem, an urban problem, a gang problem, a racial/cultural problem, or a class problem; it is as close as we have to a sociological fact.<br /><br />This brings me to my next point.&nbsp; APG7714&nbsp; seems to imply that our graffiti problem is imported from Corona (our poorer neighbors to the east), where many of the students that attend I.S. 145 (one of our neighborhoodâ€™s middle schools) live.&nbsp; This is inaccurate.&nbsp; Most of these young artists tend to paint and tag in their own neighborhoods where they can show off there work to their friends.&nbsp; The motive is not to destroy property, but to gain respect and rebel status within their peer group, which would not happen if their peers did not see their work.&nbsp; It is pure classism to suggest kids from another neighborhood are responsible for our graffiti because our teens happen to live in expensive co-ops.&nbsp; Anecdotally, last year I happen to have taught one notorious vandal who left his â€œsemiâ€ tag on every above ground surface within a three block radius from his homeâ€”the doorman building on 76th Street between 34th and 35th.<br /><br />I would also like to venture a suggestion to the community.&nbsp; Rather than demonize â€œthemâ€ for the fact that less than one percent of their peers occasionally wield a can of spray paint, why donâ€™t we use the youthful energy and community spirit of the other ninety-nine percent to clean up?&nbsp; When I polled my 7th grade students for potential community service projects, 75-percent of them recommended graffiti clean up.&nbsp; So, if those of you who hate looking at graffiti on your way to work every morning can provide the necessary supplies and supervision, I can have 100+ pairs of tireless young hands ready to wield buckets and scrub brushes on any given weekend.&nbsp; Not only would the kids love the opportunity to do something positive with their friends, but I think that you adults would benefit from a little personal interaction with a few of the thousands of the caring and vibrant young people in our community.<br /><br />Sincerely and in defense of the hundreds of talented and caring 11-15 year olds I work with every day,<br /><br />Steven Carpenter<br /><br />7th Grade Science Teacher<br />I.S. 145Q<br />Jackson Heights, NY

					I&#039;m a 7th grade teacher at I.S. 145.&nbsp; I&#039;m doing a Landscape Architecture enrichment activity with some of my students.&nbsp; We are planning to do some landscaping in front of I.S. 145 along 34th Avenue (between 79th and 80th).&nbsp; I have a few questions for the community:<br /><br />1. This Friday morning my co-teacher I are taking the students on a walk of the neighborhood to look at how gardens are set up.&nbsp; Which gardens should the kids see?&nbsp; Which are most beautiful? Most unique?&nbsp; Is there anyone out there that can help us get inside some of the inner gardens?<br /><br />2. I&#039;m looking for landscape architecture professionals/experts that could come in and talk to the kids and organizations.<br /><br />3. I&#039;d love to find some money for basic supplies (tools, plants, mulch, etc.).<br />

					I&#039;m a teacher at I.S. 145, and I&#039;m doing some &quot;greening&quot; activities with some of my seventh graders.&nbsp; I think a lot of my students would love to get involved with taking care of the park and neighborhood.&nbsp; Would your group be open to inviting some 12 year olds to participate in you meeting?<br /><br />Steven Carpenter<br /><br />7th Grade Science Teacher<br />I.S. 145Q

					I&#039;ve only lived in JH for 4 years, so I don&#039;t remember any of the above.&nbsp; But Bud&#039;s Bar seemed like it was around long enough to have had a hitchin&#039; post out front.&nbsp; Now that dive bars have become so popular in Brooklyn and Manhattan you have to wonder if Bud&#039;s could have just held on a little longer...<br /><br />Sometimes you just need to kick back, drink some beers, play some darts, and listen to some CCR on the jukebox.&nbsp; Where do you turn?&nbsp; Novo?&nbsp; To classy.&nbsp; Terraza Cafe?&nbsp; Too loud.&nbsp; The Readypenny Inn?&nbsp; Too...something, that place weirds me out.<br />
