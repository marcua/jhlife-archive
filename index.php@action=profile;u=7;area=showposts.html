					Apparently, not everyone thinks JH is that great. That&#039;s very interesting. Perhaps we should start being more objective in our opinion of JH. And I think many have been as we listed our own &quot;worst of JH or what needs to be improved&quot;<br />Some may ask:&quot;Why is Bayside much better to live in? Why is Bell Blvd so much cooler than 37 Ave?&quot; What makes Metropolitan Ave in Middle Village so attractive? What makes Bay Terrace coops and condos and their shopping center so unique? Why is living in LeHarve coop in Beechurst so attractive? I know there are folks in Jackson Heights who are not familiar or who have never heard of these places? Additionally many folks like their neighborhoods not at the focus of attention since they don&#039;t want their neighborhood to change. Sometimes change is NOT good, as the McMansion trend in LittleNeck, Douglaston and Bayside has angered residents.<br />Cool bars, Starbucks and ethnic diversity may take a back seat to peace &amp; quiet suburban setting (but knowing you&#039;re in NYC and paying NYC R/E taxes!!), excellent school districts, <strong>not</strong> being near the city, and a place to park your car, namely your own driveway.<br /><br />I did not move to JH because of ethnic diversity, great restaurants or as some folks on the other link mentioned &quot;trannies&quot;. Nevertheless it is the best location for my wife and me and we have no immediate plans to move.<br />However I can&#039;t see myself retiring here, as I&#039;m some of us don&#039;t see as well.

					I doubt that they would charge you corkage. This restaurant is not that upscale. As a matter of fact, it&#039;s well, kind of dumpy, but they are trying. You have to go and check it out yourself. If you&#039;re expecting something comparable with a West Village quaint little restaurant, or a Lanza&#039;s on the LES,you&#039;ll be quite disappointed. I liked the food, but being a new ethnic restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood that is sooo. ethnically un-Italian, may be a problem The folks in the neighborhood expect Colombian, Ecuadorian, Mexican not as a Restaurant for fine dining, but as a place to just hang out. I&#039;m used to going to an Italian Restaurant for fine dining. If I want to hang out and chew the fat whle eating Italian food, I&#039;ll go to a pizzeria. If this place had a pizzeria section, it would probably do well, snce Pizza is popular with all ethnic backgrounds.<br /><br />I hope I&#039;m wrong and this place flourishes. But talking about it, whether positive or negative is like talking about a movie that is so offensive or so vulgar. It&#039;s so extreme, people want to check it out because of curiousity. If you knew that a singer or other entertainer was just so bad wouldn&#039;t you want to hear him/her becaue it&#039;s the talk of the town? Not that this restaurant is that bad, but there are like a zillion comments about it in less than a week.<br /><br />(I think we&#039;re all desperate for something othet than a chicken house!!)

					Shinju:<br /><br />I&#039;m no restaurant connoisseur, but bringing your own drinks to a restaurant is a tad bold for my taste. It&#039;s like talking on a cell phone to a friend while on a date, or excusing yourself from the table at a dinner invitation to order a pizza.<br /><br />Ma, e la sua vita ! Buona fortuna !

					Wow! I checked out Chowhound. I&#039;m not alone. I did forget to mention two heaters in the place. Can&#039;t wait for the summer to get that natural warmth without a/c (<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />) I did not notice any HVAC in the &quot;dining&quot; area. Recessed lighting but please God, we need a/c in the summer if it&#039;s still around.<br /><br />&nbsp;As far as the portable heaters, I just feel it&#039;s illegal. I hope they don&#039;t get cited.&nbsp;

					Well. You really should go there yourself to experience the, uh.the uh.......Well quite frankly I&#039;m not sure what I experienced!<br />The decor is yellow walls horribly painted by some one who probably likes to paint. It was not that impressive. I guess the yellow was to simulate a lemon(?) ergo the joint&#039;s name?<br />I ordered a simple appetizer of Tortellini in brodo, which I love. Only $3.95. It was not that bad. Quite good, honestly. My wife ordered grilled shrimp with veggies. It cost $18. (Sounsd like Parkside or Piccola Venezia prices). It was very good. So far..so good.. We did notice that in addition to the 2 of us, there was only 1 other party there. A couple. Total of about 10 tables. I thought.hmmmmm they better get volume to survive. Anyway, the very cordial waiter and host were a pleasure. I ordered<br />lasagne. Now how can someone mess that up? The dish came in a very hort plate and was really good. We had 2 diet cokes ( Thin sipping straw in an attractive stemmed glass. No cans thank God) I had Tiramisu and a tea. Total after tax and tip $56.00<br /><br />That&#039;s not cheap considering we could get similar prices for a restaurant with decor, (Curtains, flowers, etc) The problem is that it is not unique as far as Italian restaurant food is concerned. But the appearance is so cheap in a neighborhood where peeple look inside with the thought &quot;An Italian restaurant?? What&#039;s this?) The menu is in English only . The Italian dishes are really Italian by NY Standards, with no Colombian or Ecuadorian dishes on the side for those who prefeto&nbsp; eat their native own food. The staff is obviously bilingual, but I got a sense that the folks in the restaurant (another couple came in for a total of 6 people in about an hour&#039;s time-not good) weren&#039;t really sure what they were eating. <br /><br />My wife and I mised the Monday-Sat 11.00 lunch special ( Appetizer, main course,-including sides of vegetable and potato and soft drink) That&#039;s a fantastic deal. <br /><br />I have doubts about this place since the food is OK but the location is bad and the &quot;Experience&quot; was not good. The view out the window reminded me of a deserted town in Iraq. It was depressing. But then again, Ithaca Ave and 8nd Street isn&#039;t quite bermuda. It is very ugly.I want to hear Sinatra and be in a palace. At least there should have been more people. BTW: One of the lunch specials includes Broiled salmon, trout or Tilapia. Again the food is a condensed version of NYC Typical Italian American Dishes.<br /><br />It&#039;s a pleasure to have this hole in the ground. It belongs on 37 Ave near the Starbucks.(But I&#039;m sure the rent&nbsp; would be prohibitive) It&#039;s a cafe size restaurant. But again the decor has all the appeal of a check cashing place. But the staff is very nice (As they have to be) Please try it out and support a neighborhood place. Visa MC and AMex. No Discover card. There is no alcohol. (No vino at an Italian restaurant??? That sucks)<br /><br /><br />Oh! I forgot to tell you. Tables with attractive silverware and table cloths and rather simple pieces of Italian bread in a basket. Now that I think of it again,this place belongs on 30th Ave or Broadway in Astoria ONLY if they get their decor together. You don&#039;t go on a first date looking like a bum and then tellthe girl &quot;I&#039;ll shave very soon and fix the hole in my pants tomorrow&#039; He&#039;ll be history in a second.This restaurant had only 1 time to make a first impression. I give it a very generous C+<br /><br />PS : Totally unrelated: Don&#039;t expect the 84th /83rd street Thomas&#039; Pizza to be around in about 2 years. the lease expires then (As per Pedro the manager) and you know the rent will probably doube. No one can afford $4 slices.
