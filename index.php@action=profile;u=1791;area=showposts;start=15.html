					I live in the 70s near 35th.&nbsp; I guess what&#039;s feeding my fear is:<br /><br />a) The nature of the recent crimes.&nbsp; They&#039;re violent, generally senseless and indicate that there are people in this neighborhood who are seriously psychologically messed up.&nbsp; I am a criminal psychologist and can tell you that burglaries and car break-ins are scary but crimes where people are being beaten with baseball bats (to death at times) indicate that seriously disturbed people are roaming around on our streets.&nbsp; It&#039;s one thing to mug someone for money (such crimes usually do go up with a receding economy) but it&#039;s another thing to beat someone to death or pose a fake food order and then crack a baseball bat across their skull.&nbsp; These recent crimes were not committed by isolated figures looking for cash.&nbsp; They were, in general, committed by groups of two or more.&nbsp; It indicates a culture of violence--these criminals are socializing with each other and making their behavior acceptable. <br /><br />Anyway, I won&#039;t get into the research of it but it shows that there are some very bad characters living amongst us and around us.<br /><br />b) The quiet, isolated, dimly-lit streets.&nbsp; I won&#039;t get into this one as I had already mentioned what I thought of this in my earlier posts.<br /><br /><br />I know every neighborhood has crime but it&#039;s unfortunate that this would be happening in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; When I first moved here, my husband and I went out for dinner on Valentine&#039;s Day.&nbsp; We decided to check out a restaurant on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; The street was crowded with people and it was fairly early (around 7:30pm).&nbsp; Pretty soon, we noticed two young men following us.&nbsp; They would stop whenever we stopped to look at a menu and wait for us.&nbsp; We even did a little experiment to see if they would cross streets with us, etc.&nbsp; When we started taking obvious notice of what they were doing, one of them grinned at us.&nbsp; Finally, we went into Jahn&#039;s because we felt so uneasy and they waited outside for two minutes before taking off.&nbsp; It was the first time something like that happened to me in the city in a long time (I grew up in Queens) and, after living in JH for a few months, it wasn&#039;t the last time...

					There&#039;s a surge in crime, lately, and that feels scary but, in general, I don&#039;t feel <em>safe</em> in JH...I just feel creeped out by how dark it is and how few people are out and about on the streets.<br /><br />I also have a friend who lives in JH who is from Colombia and he told me that JH is riddled with gangs, some of them really dangerous and that the gang members know that police presence is not really a big deal at JH.

					Also,&nbsp; I have noticed that there is almost no police patrolling JH streets.&nbsp; I used to live in other neighborhoods and it was common to see police beat cops and patrol.&nbsp; What&#039;s up with that?&nbsp; How can we advocate for more police in our neighborhood?<br /><br />I have to say that, as a female, I have been feeling unsafe around JH since I moved here.&nbsp; I have resorted to carrying pepper spray and wearing my ugliest glasses and longest coat to not draw attention.&nbsp; I feel like men make more lewd comments to me around JH subways and streets than in other neighborhoods.&nbsp; The residential streets are dark and quiet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t know how I feel about safety and living here.&nbsp; It can be done (I grew up in South Jamaica, Queens) but it&#039;s not very comfortable.<br /><br />Am I just being paranoid?&nbsp; Thoughts?

					Hi,<br /><br />I&#039;m an apartment owner in Jackson Heights and am worried.&nbsp; There has been so much reported crime in Jackson Heights lately, it&#039;s terrifying.&nbsp; What&#039;s going on?&nbsp; I know people like to compare Jackson Heights to Astoria but it seems like Astoria is safer.<br /><br />Do others feel as unsafe as I do?&nbsp; Does anyone know why there has been such a resurgence of crime?&nbsp;

					I had asked around on this board for a mortgage broker recommendation a few months ago.&nbsp; Well, after six months of struggling, we finally bought the coop we were renting!&nbsp; The biggest hurdle was obtaining financing.&nbsp; Although we make decent money and were able to put 35% down, banks are jittery about lending money these days (one of us runs a business and does not get a standard W-2 so it&#039;s complicated).&nbsp; My first step was to go to a banker with Wells Fargo.&nbsp; The broker was really nice but was really non-communicative.&nbsp; We waited over three months just for a commitment letter just because he seemed like he didn&#039;t know how to &quot;arrange&quot; our file and what to request.&nbsp; We got a &quot;UFT&quot; discount because one of us works in education but, in the end, it wasn&#039;t even worth it.&nbsp; Wells requested hard copies of all my regular credit payment checks from the past THREE years.&nbsp; Chase charged me $6.00 a copy and it ended up costing me a ridiculous amount of money.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time photocopying documents and delivering them to the Wells office on 45th and 5th Avenue.&nbsp; Not fun.<br /><br />In the meantime, I was getting so frustrated with him, I ended up calling Sterling National and the banker there was amazing.&nbsp; She got me a commitment letter within 10 days.&nbsp; I felt bad but I had to leave my mortgage banker at Wells because the file just wasn&#039;t going anywhere. <br /><br />So that&#039;s my recommendation to you: Marilyn Korman and AnneMarie Federlein were magical.&nbsp; They got my financing in order in a little over a month, despite jittery banks and the tax credit backlog.&nbsp; I was panicking because I was leaving for a long trip and they managed to get it all in order the day before I left.&nbsp; Incredible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, you can reach Marilyn at <a href="mailto:Marilyn.Korman@sterlingnational.com" class="bbc_email">Marilyn.Korman@sterlingnational.com</a> if you need her.&nbsp; She&#039;ll review your file and tell you like it is and tell you exactly what you need.&nbsp; <br />

					Thanks!&nbsp; This was so helpful!&nbsp; <br /><br />It turns out that we&#039;re not mortgage-able.&nbsp; Now the seller is really mad at us but we only made an offer about two weeks ago and just had them send the contract to our attorney...Do I owe them something now?&nbsp; I am unsure as to what to do.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that I want to back out of the deal--we just can&#039;t find anyone to co-sign on our mortgage!&nbsp; Plus, two weeks seems like a really short amount of time...

					Hi, <br /><br />Sorry for the all the questions but I&#039;m new to the process.&nbsp; If, for some reason, we get rejected by our coop board, would we end up losing a lot of money in terms of closing costs?&nbsp; Do attorneys, etc. give you your $ back if the deal doesn&#039;t go through?&nbsp; <br /><br />This website lists the extent of the costs for the purschaser of a coop:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nyc-apartments.net/33.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc-apartments.net/33.html</a><br /><br />Are any or all of these costs refundable if the coop rejects you?&nbsp; <br /><br />Gosh, it&#039;s so much work to buy a coop!<br /><br />Thanks for any advice/help.

					Hi there,<br /><br />Thanks so much for your input:&nbsp; I guess I should re-phrase it: I love the apartment but since it&#039;s on the first floor and not a true two-bedroom, I feel the owner should come down in price a bit. <br /><br />I&#039;m trying to gather some information on the area and what reasonable prices are in order to arm myself with information once I try to negotiate more with the owner.<br /><br />I really appreciate your help!

					Hi hi,<br /><br />Thanks for your response.&nbsp; It&#039;s in a pretty nice building and the apartment doesn&#039;t need to be renovated.&nbsp; The first floor thing will probably be a little annoying but I still think it&#039;s a bit overpriced, no?&nbsp; <br /><br />The one good thing is that you can sublet the apartment out...<br /><br />Let me know what you guys think!<br />

					Hi everyone!<br /><br />I really need some advice--I&#039;ve been looking for an apartment in Jackson Heights for a long time now and found one in the 70s near 35th avenue.&nbsp; The building is beautiful and it&#039;s a one-bedroom converted into a two-bedroom (the additional &quot;bedroom&quot; is quite small).&nbsp; The asking price is $230,000 and the owner is refusing to come down from the asking price.&nbsp; The apartment is on the first floor so it can be a little noisy and all...<br /><br />Does this price seem reasonable?&nbsp; The condition of the apartment is decent.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to find any data at this point and it&#039;s so confusing because the real estate market has gone down so much!<br /><br />
