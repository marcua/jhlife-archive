				&nbsp;Yes, it&#039;s here, finally, the long wished for Jackson Heights Community Center! Not certain of a lot of the details but this will go a long way in helping with activities all year round as well as adding to a meetup for locals and a bunch of other community needs. Hip, hip hooray to Danny Dromm and the other politicians and countless neighbors and activists who have been asking for this for years. Seriously, years.<br />&nbsp; So now we can reconfigure the needs of the community as a whole. Include as many people as possible, as many ages as possible, as many streets as possible to form a cohesive plan for everyone to have activities and exercise and community involvement here in JH. Rain or shine,<br />heat wave or cold snap, this facility will be available and this is absolutely great news!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you haven&#039;t heard much about it yet, read below. Of course we will all need to help fund raise and give suggestions but the groundwork is laid here.<br /><br />&nbsp;https://sunnysidepost.com/variety-boys-and-girls-club-gets-2-7-million-from-city-to-build-a-new-community-center-in-jackson-heights<br />

The middle of the crowd is so comfortable ABCDE...come join it. The water&#039;s fine.<br />Let Danny D. lead the brass band, shall we? Unless you are speaking about yourself/your friends&nbsp; here? All the folks I know are just happy that it&#039;s happening, again, yipee!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;And as to where they will put it, the Jewish Center on 37th and 77th St has been mentioned as a possible site. There is also the police parking lot on Northern Blvd and 90th? next to the precinct that the city owns. And probably some other possibilities the realtors know more about...

				Jumping in! Thanks Itsit.<br /><br />A great location would be the parking lot for the supermarket on 34th Ave/Junction Bld.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Then the kids can also be close to the open street and utilize that as well. <br /><br />Win/win for the kids!

				&nbsp;Please meet me know when you and Jessica Ramos meet to discuss the use of the supermarket parking lot so it could be adjacent to open street for 34th Ave. It was this very block that Jessie was asking the DOT to consider opening in one of the online forums because that store was so vital to her constituents locally. But hey, the kids really do need all 26 blocks right? Not 25, 21but ALL 26, shoppers, grandmas, locals we&#039;ll say so sorry to your needs and access. <br />&nbsp; Again, please give some notice so I can get the popcorn ready because Sen. Ramos has a strong opinion here on this topic.

				&nbsp;But your support of the Latino communities needs in their love of shopping the supermarket on Junction and 34th are not hidden. And the awful traffic that open streets creates on Junction is not hidden or loved by the community. Thankfully, it has been under consideration with the DOT (at least according to the sessions they conducted online) to be opened on that block in accordance with community needs. The pleas for help seemed to heard by the DOT.<br />&nbsp; That&#039;s what we like about compromise and hearing everyone out and making tweaks and adjustments accordingly. Kindness and consideration of all, over 10 yrs old and under 10 yrs old alike. And yipee, a community center!!! and the Astoria one is five stories tall. Can we dream as they also use the pool word...omg! Is a pool coming to JH?
