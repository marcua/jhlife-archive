				&nbsp;The public forum by the DOT conducted last month said that they were holding a number of these meetings to determine what the thoughts and issues were on both sides. Was that a SHAM? Over 500 people signed on to that meeting with translators and the many commentators were told it was to gather information over several publicized events. People who had issues with traffic on Junction Blvd. received more compassion than those on 78th street, for example. It felt like just the beginning of a dialogue on many aspects. They sent out another community survey request just yesterday -https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/34thAve<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Or is possible that Danny Dromm is speaking out of turn here? It&#039;s certainly odd that this would not have been publicized in a bigger way, if it were true. How could anyone believe they are truly interested in hearing both sides if a decision has, in fact, already been made? Maybe the &quot;r&quot; in the survey request is for <strong>redundant</strong>?

				I understood that there is commitment to explore ways to make the arrangement permanent. That said, Danny&#039;s newsletter, like the latest DOT survey, emphasize that the details are being worked out, and that&#039;s where the community will have opportunity to offer feedback. Hence, the meeting in December, the survey, an upcoming meeting after the survey has closed, and other opportunities, mentioned in the DOT message. So, no, I don&#039;t agree it was a sham, and I do think these are valid opportunities to provide feedback.

				I was just sent an invitation today to respond to a survey regarding the proposed open street and it certainly seems like the DOT is not interested in hearing from anyone who has serious opposition to the changeover. Much like the loading zones that have suddenly been forced upon certain blocks in our neighborhood, the DOT seems to be acting with the full backing of the Mayor&#039;s office, and without having an overall master plan for finding a way for passenger cars, delivery trucks, bikes and pedestrians to share the roads safely and efficiently.

I, too, don&#039;t understand the after-the-fact surveying and community outreach they&#039;re doing now, when clearly the decision was made months ago without community input. <br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/GMiGthF.png)<br /><br />Open Street for 34th Ave. to be permanent (https://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/open-street-for-34th-ave-to-be-permanent/article_74d386f8-8d03-5a1c-b37f-43b9d02aa2f8.html)

				&nbsp;The dialogue was great, in my opinion, on the DOT zoom call last month. The first lay person speaking was very articulate about her support of the Open Streets conflicting with a real life need to be able to work online in her home while loud classes were happening on 34th ave outside her window. And there were others on both sides with legit issues which were not necessarily for or against the idea of Open Streets but questioning the strategy of the closures - if there is one - and how it changes after the pandemic.<br /><br />&nbsp;The concern here is not whether people are for or against or neutral but what is the status of the 34th Ave Open Streets situation right now. We have a local politician announcing to constituents in his newsletter the closure is <strong>permanent</strong> (and thanking Polly Trottenberg for her help) while at the same time, the DOT is saying they are still collecting information and <strong>the topic is still open for discussion, so NOT PERMANENT? </strong>These are contradictory points of view and someone is lying here and the question remains, who is not telling the truth, Danny Dromm or the DOT group?

				&nbsp;So, we are not going to wait till the pandemic is under control or till the DOT survey is compiled? I guess not. Are we rushing to please a certain constituency? Apparently, we are the poster child for the Open Streets program which has failed in every other community. No other area in NYC thought this was a wise, well thought out solution to wanting more space in their community by all parties. Not one. <br /><br />&nbsp;Let&#039;s see what is going to happen with school buses, sanitation trucks, deliveries and various others that formerly were heavy users of 34th Ave. Maybe the Magic School Bus franchise has a solution and can whisk them all skyward to their destinations? Need something mystical here as the bike and vehicular traffic was intense before the pandemic and is not likely to be much less when we get back to &quot;normalcy.&quot; Big questions here long term with city planning.

Observe during the pandemic, watch while spring and summer and vaccines arrive, and see if post-pandemic life moves the needle. Traffic has picked up considerably and if schools get back to somewhat of a normal schedule, there may be a need to reevaluate, even from people who love the 34th Ave Open Streets, to see if there is equity for the whole neighborhood in terms of getting around, to work, school and MTA busses, deliveries and safety. Give it a chance please, I couldn&#039;t agree more. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also, areas like 14th Street and Times Square in Manhattan being closed are not comparable to a much more residential area like Jackson Heights, except if we were to close 74th St or 37th Ave. And we have to see long term, if business can thrive in those situations. Not sure.<br />

Not just 34th Ave in Jackson Heights.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Which of the open streets program besides 34th Ave will become permanent? I tried a quick google search and all I came up with is that some residents are petitioning to have Berry St. become a permanent open street, but not that it was confirmed. Please post a link to a list of the streets that will be permanent Open Streets.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/nyc-outdoor-dining-covid-open-streets/585984/#:~:text=Over%2010%2C000%20restaurants%20currently%20participate,made%20permanent%2C%20de%20Blasio%20said.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The link you provided is about Open Street-restaurants, which is a different program.<br />Here is the city&#039;s information about Open Streets-restaurants https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets-restaurants.shtml<br /><br />Here&#039;s information about Open Streets. https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml<br /><br />They are two different programs. 34th Ave is part of Open Streets (not Open Streets- restaurants, obviously since there are no restaurants on 34th Ave). The discussion on this board is about Open Streets, not Open Streets-restaurants. If you&#039;d like to discuss the restaurants program, it would make sense to start a separate thread to avoid confusion.

				Agree it&#039;s confusing.<br /><br />But the OPEN STREETS in Astoria (Like our 34th Ave) have been incredibly well received. <br /><br />https://www.givemeastoria.com/2020/09/04/31st-avenue-stroll-open-streets-provides-a-safer-way-to-gather/
