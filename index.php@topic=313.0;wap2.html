			Will one of the mods please explain why this topic was locked.&nbsp; :-\

			I believe that Lety&#039;s opted to lock it.&nbsp; This area is primarily for announcements anyway, so please use the &quot;Neighborhood Chat&quot; area for commentary or discussion.

			WOW! Mods who take direction from members and then change thread titles and don&#039;t change locations by themselves.<br /><br />I&#039;m not likin&#039; this at all!

			Sorry to upset you.&nbsp; Here&#039;s an explanation:<br /><br />1. None of the moderators locked the other thread.&nbsp; As far as we can tell, it was done by the author.<br /><br />2. The Lety&#039;s thread was posted in the wrong board, so it was indeed moved to this one by one of the moderators.<br /><br />3. I changed the name of your thread since it was confusing to have two threads by the same name.&nbsp; Until today, the other moderators and I didn&#039;t even notice that this locking feature was enabled.&nbsp; Since we&#039;re likely to start getting more questions about it, it seemed appropriate to use this thread as the place to discuss it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />--Todd

			Todd,<br />Not only is the Lock Thread feature available, so is the Remove Thread. It seems to me that they should be removed/disabled from the general public ASAP. I would also suggest that if the OP did, either accidentally or intentionally, lock the thread that a mod unlock it. It is not that the subject matter is that important, but that this feature should be used only for either items that have been moved, or a thread that has gotten totally out of hand with flaming to allow posters a time to cool off.<br /><br />I intentionally named my post the same as the OP because I felt that they might still be merged. <br /><br />I personally really appreciate business owners who come to these forums as it gives the community an opportunity to let them know how they are doing and the business owner a chance to see how they are accepted in the community.<br /><br />I also find the Remove Thread somewhat dangerous to be left enabled to the general public. Anyone who wants to can hit the button and a lengthy forum discussion can just disappear. If someone makes a post that they regret, they have a reasonable period of time to Modify it or Delete their posting. But no-one should have the right or ability to delete a thread. If you are not happy with what your wrote, modify it. If you change your mind later down the line, post an apology. <br /><br />I have discovered some great new places to shop in Jackson Heights as a result of this forum, and I would be distressed if some malicious person removed a thread because they didn&#039;t like the topic or because they had had a problem with a local business. <br /><br />I thank you not only for answering my post but also for the tone of your post. <br /><br />Respectfully.<br />Lorrie
