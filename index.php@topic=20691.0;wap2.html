			Found a great person through this list a few months ago and had an amicable exchange of services for payment, but he&#039;s disappeared.&nbsp; Busy in a job, or whatever.&nbsp; After a few weeks of waiting for a reply, need to find another person.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t want to discard a table, but it&#039;s worn, what to do?&nbsp; All ideas appreciated with thanks.&nbsp;

			There is a company that I think might be called Oscar in Corona I think? I once priced out a refinish with them but wound up replacing the table instead.

It&#039;s more cost-effective to throw out the old one and buy a new one.
