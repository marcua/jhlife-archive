Soccer is sooo popular in this neighborhood and it will be much appreciated to have some of these mini pitches populate our small parks and school spaces. Yipee!<br /><a href="https://jacksonheightspost.com/city-completes-goal-to-construct-50-soccer-pitches-throughout-the-five-boroughs-in-five-years" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://jacksonheightspost.com/city-completes-goal-to-construct-50-soccer-pitches-throughout-the-five-boroughs-in-five-years</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I think the pitch you mention is part of St. Michael&#039;s Park and used to also be used for baseball. According to the link you posted, the project has been completed. The mini-pitch at Moser Playground is the only local project mentioned. The local CYO soccer teams have been very successful over the years and there are some men&#039;s leagues that have been playing in the schoolyards at IS 145 and Garden School. M Clancy also has had a successful Girls soccer team since they went co-ed, and Lexington School has a nice pitch. It would be nice if these facilities were available for soccer development programs, but insurance and legal considerations may make that unlikely. Nevertheless, soccer has been strong in the neighborhood for as long as I remember.

					Before this board disappears, I have a favor to ask. If anyone remembers, please ask your landlord, co-op board or owners association to switch from the gas powered leaf blowers to the quieter and less air polluting electric models. I realize there are bigger problems facing the neighborhood, but this seems like really low hanging fruit and something that we can easily influence.

That&#039;s nearly 1,500 cab rides that cost $25 or less, so you could take 150 cab rides every year for nearly a decade for that amount of money.

I understand the concern about parking, I drive. While I can stomach a small reduction in parking spaces, and even a slow gradual reduction of more parking spaces, I also strongly believe that must be accompanied by overall improvement in public transit that makes it easier for more people to decide they don&#039;t actually need a car (or a second car),<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the shared block concept is escaping me.&nbsp; In fact, I find the whole diagram confusing except the plaza streets and the streets that are seemingly left alone except for the diverters.&nbsp; The original street diagram shows 23 parking spots per block.&nbsp; The new one shows 20 spots per block, or 13% fewer, (with things like hydrants and driveways other no parking zones ignored).&nbsp; The plaza streets have only 6 spots, or 73% fewer.&nbsp; The shared blocks I have no idea what&#039;s going on there.&nbsp; It seems like there are 3 plaza blocks, and the shared blocks seem to be sometimes both sides and sometimes only one side.&nbsp; My guess is there would be 6 spots remaining on each of the shared blocks to accommodate the chicanes, so there is a loss of 5 or 6 on each side, but I could be wrong.&nbsp; Someone will have to count the actual current legal spots and figure out where the chicanes and diverters and bumpouts and pedestrian plazas cut prospective spots to get an accurate count.<br /><br />Add in street cleaning rules and the Sunday Green Market if you want to be confused even more.<br /><br />At least the parking garages will make some money off this!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

I don&#039;t know what plan you are looking at, but it&#039;s not the plan DoT presented to CB3. The plan DoT presented would eliminate parking on one side of 34th Avenue at the proposed plaza blocks (Travers and the blocks directly in front of schools along 34th Avenue) and the chicanes I guess would eliminate at least one spot, but that&#039;s far from at least half the current parking spots.<br /><br />It&#039;s one thing to criticize the plan or express dissatisfaction with it for removing parking spots - we all have our own prioirities - but it&#039;s an entirely different thing to misrepresent the plan. So what plan are you looking at that suggests to you the removal of *at least 50% of the parking* along 34th Avenue between 69th St. and Junction?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you add up the plaza blocks and the shared blocks along with the spaces removed to allow the diverters to remain unobstructed, you may find the number accurate. However the only pages showing actual parking spaces were for plaza streets, like page 28, so I was misunderstanding the diagrams.

If you are currently parked in a spot it&#039;s common to say it&#039;s your parking spot, at least until you move. Semantics aside, it appears that at least half of the current&nbsp; parking spots along 34th will be removed. I&#039;m sure you would prefer that all were removed, but where will these people park? It&#039;s hard enough on Alternate Side days as it is.

					Sorry, it looks like maybe half the parking is retained. The diagrams show parking spaces up into the chicane on each block. I would expect much of this to be changed once the residents find out their parking spots are mostly going away. I also wonder how they&#039;re going to handle double parked cars and delivery vehicles paring in front of the diverters, similarly to how they park in the intersections currently.

It&#039;s a link to an article about the proposal. The actual proposal is within a .pdf file you can download from <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/34th-ave-open-street-cb3-full-board-oct2021.pdf</a>.<br /><br />It&#039;s 43 pages so take some time to ensure you understand everything within the proposal.<br />My concerns were the reduction of time (which as far as I can tell has been increased to 24 hours) and the need to move the barricades. The only way it seems to me that this will be addressed is if parking is prohibited along 34th Avenue.&nbsp; This will most likely force car owners to engage in a non-stop search for parking or to fork over several hundred a month in the off chance they can actually find a parking space to rent. It says nothing about the current traffic mess on Northern Blvd, 35th and 37th Avenues and even 32nd Avenue during rush hours. It also doesn&#039;t mention whether the reduction in accidents and injuries were simply moved to other streets. I hope I&#039;m reading this incorrectly.

Cars were the main danger all along!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The Queens Eagle reported that injuries along Open Streets we&#039;re down 42% last year. However injuries citywide we&#039;re down 38%. So while some of the improvement appears to be from Open Streets, clearly the reduced number of people walking about during the pandemic was influential as well. Using statistics from 2020 will always be problematic, since cultural behavior was abnormal. Comparing 2021 to 2019 might be more useful, but I haven&#039;t seen those numbers yet. It&#039;s similar to the law and order crusaders claiming that violence is up due to defunding the police and bail reform, and comparing last year&#039;s abnormally low homicides (when people were on lockdown) to this year&#039;s, when last year&#039;s scores are being settled. While the numbers are accurate, the truth is more complex.
