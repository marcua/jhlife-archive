				I saw shutters down on the &quot;Pizza Boy&quot; joint on the corner of 74th st/37 ave, and workers doing serious interior modifications. I don&#039;t know whether they are gutting it but it looks pretty drastic.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they are doing renovation or .....something else?

				I hope he&#039;s not shutting down! Pizza Boy is my favorite out of our mediocre pizza options. My guess is that they are doing a reno because they could really use one.

				I wish someone would finally remove the graffiti from the wall above Pizza Boy. It&#039;s been there forever and is such an eyesore.

				I had a slice there last week. I actually thought the sauce was great, however the cheese and dough wasn&#039;t great at all. Also, I did like how thin it was. If they were working with better ingredients, they&#039;d have great pizza... imho

				Ok so they renovated the place both inside and out. And I&#039;m sure they spent good money to do it. But why does pizza parlor decor always manage to look so tacky? It could have been a whole lot better. It must be the genre. <br /><br />According to the owner he&#039;s been there for 45 years. And I think it was a pizza parlor even before that.

				If at first you don&#039;t succeed........--What was the point of this renovation??? Doesn&#039;t look any better than it did before.&nbsp; They should have taken that money and did some research on how to make a good pizza instead.

				It&#039;s really quite amazing. Next to the lack of a good neighborhood bar, the lack of a good slice often comes up in conversation I have with other parents.<br /><br />&nbsp;I often think about smiling pizza on seventh Avenue in Park slope. A decent slice, though I don&#039;t think anyone would say amazing. Situated right by the F train&nbsp; and nearby schools and a hospital, it is always packed. <br /><br />I also think about Mario&#039;s, being across from a humongous public school. After kids get out, that place should be packed. Why is it not?&nbsp; I hope that&#039;s one thing the owners contemplate as they watch kids get out with their parents and then head in other directions on 37th Ave.
