				Hi, I am renovating my 1919 bathroom and I&#039;d like to stick to the original design: 1&quot; unglazed hex tiles on the floor, subway tiles on the walls. <br /><br />I am looking for a cove tile EXACTLY like the one in the picture. This tile is known as sanitary or cove tile and connects the base of the wall to the floor. Any suggestions on where I can find such tiles? &nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks! <br /><br /><br />

				my ex and i did a similar renovation of our early &#039;20s house back in the late 90s....we found bits and pieces around salvage shops, but ultimately had to buy a few accent pieces at this place<br /><br />http://www.historichouseparts.com/subway_tile.htm<br /><br />it&#039;s a little pricey, but i think they may have the cove tile

				Thanks, Native. This is indeed Subwaytile.com but it is very thick -- 3/8 of an inch. Do you think I can use those together with the much thinner wall tiles? Would there be any installation difficulties?

				<span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">@ carrefour<br /><br />Depends on the mud or thinset, most of the time if you hire a true ceramic contractor they know how to modify the installation so as to accommodate a thinner or thicker tile, as long as the face profile is the same.&nbsp; A lot of this older installations have a very thick amount of cements material and might be tricky to fit in.&nbsp; The contractor or yourself can use a grout scraper to remove the entire grout.&nbsp; Since this is an old installation you will need patience.&nbsp; If need be you might want to use a grinder with a special disk. Take a small chisel and lightly hit with the hammer and be careful because you can break the adjacent tiles.<br /><br />Tap the broken tile with a small cold chisel and lightly hammer it until it breaks up.&nbsp; Once the tile is out, then the decision will have to be made on how to remove the cement/glue used.&nbsp; My guys like using high velocity power tools but it requires a little practice.&nbsp; After the area is clear it&#039;s just a matter of setting the tile deeper until it is at the same level as the other.&nbsp; Are you going to remove the grout and re-grout the walls?</span>
