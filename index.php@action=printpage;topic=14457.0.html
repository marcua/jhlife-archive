				Since moving to JH over 6 years ago, I&#039;ve had to adjust the way I cross the road (in the pedestrian crosswalk). Even though the lights say I can walk, I&#039;m constantly looking around for that one car whose driver doesn&#039;t want to wait for people walking. And I&#039;m constantly fed up with pedestrians not crossing when they&#039;re able to, simply because they think they have to wait for a car that&#039;s making a turn as fast as they can.<br /><br />Tonight my BF was almost hit by a young girl driving recklessly -- she made a turn into the crosswalk and only missed him because I pulled him back. I took down her license plate and called 311 to report to the Police, but what else can we do here?<br /><br />I&#039;m so sick and tired of reckless drivers. I&#039;m sick of having to speed up my walking or jump out of the way of oncoming vehicles, even when it is MY turn to walk across the road. <br /><br />Does anyone else have this problem?!

				i think you can call the precinct and file a report or complaint on that car/driver if you have the plate. its recorded, and if they were pulled over, it would come up when the cops check their license, etc

				This isn&#039;t just an JH or NYC thing. This is an everywhere thing. <br /><br />Of course you should always be careful when crossing a street, even if you have the crosswalk, or are crossing on a one way street, because you never know when a driver is going to screw up. This was drilled in to me as a small child, and it sticks with me today as a driver and a pedestrian. I&#039;ve been the driver that accidentally turns in to a one way street I&#039;m not supposed to turn on. I&#039;ve been the driver blinded by the morning light who didn&#039;t see pedestrians. So as a pedestrian, I know to not rely upon drivers being mistake free or even good. That&#039;s a good way to increase your chances of getting killed or seriously hurt.

				I absolutely agree that some drivers in the neighborhood drive like maniacs, but as a pedestrian and a driver, I want to say that pedestrians in this neighborhood are HORRIBLE.&nbsp; I have often had to slam my brakes because someone decides to cross the street without looking up from their cell phone against the light, decides to run across the street mid-block or decides that he&#039;s going to stand in the middle of the crosswalk hoping to scare some driver into stopping so he can cross.&nbsp; A special mention to those people who double park and then they (or their passengers) just open their doors without looking or caring about what is coming at them.&nbsp; I hate these people just as much as I hate the reckless drivers.

				I beg to differ but I walk around the city a lot, both Manhattan and Queens, and Jackson Heights seems particularly plagued by bad drivers who don&#039;t seem to understand the most basic rules. My specific gripe is that no one seems to know how to make a left turn, especially on 37th Avenue. A driver shouldn&#039;t start the turn unless the crosswalk is clear, but around here they start, then stop for a pedestrian in the crosswalk and wave them through, all while blocking traffic headed in the opposite direction. And don&#039;t get me started on drivers who will do a spontaneous full-speed U-turn anywhere without warning just to nab a parking spot.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t understand why the 115th Precinct can&#039;t put together a sting operation every now and then and pull some of these lousy drivers off our local streets. I see dangerous acts like this almost every single day.

				I agree - I think JH is particularly bad as far as the drivers go.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget the u turns and backing up to an intersection, in addition to the illegal turns on red light, running lights, and not giving pedestrians the right of way, even when the pedestrian is already crossing with the light.&nbsp; I too have been mystified as to why there seem to be no tickets given in JH for driving offenses.&nbsp; In other neighborhoods the local precinct does ticket for offenses and it does decrease these offenses.

				I agree with this post, there are a lot of unruly drivers in Jackson Heights<br /><br /><br />BUT also keep in mind as a driver (not as a profession) but as having a car here and using it daily, I often drive on 35th ave and when my light is green, many, many people will venture off the safe sidewalk and try and cross when there light is red- this is very dangerous...I guess people are in a rush, it goes both ways<br /><br />My rule of thumb is (esp when I have my dogs in hand) is to wait 5-10 seconds on the corner after the cross walk light is in my favor just to wait for the typical red light driver or no right turn on red driver that will do it at the last second...<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve lived in a couple of Queens neighborhoods, and the recklessness of drivers is the same everywhere. People don&#039;t hop in their car and get to Jackson Heights and decide to be even more reckless. And, as a bike rider, pedestrians are the same everywhere. Too many staring down at their phones, walking in to a bike lane without looking, etc.<br /><br />If people are really concerned, they might consider advocating for speed bumps.

				This should be something addressed at the upcoming school safety town hall some elected officials are hosting. <br />Transportation Alternatives is finally addressing this a bit more with a new campaign for more speed cameras, which currently are only on during school hours. NYC only has around 140 speed cameras around 1,600 schools. <br /><br />I know the post is about reckless driving, but it&#039;s a good opportunity for parents to have their thoughts amplified: If this interests you, contact Jaime Moncayo from TA. They are looking for parents to be quoted for the new campaign. jaime.moncayo@transalt.org<br /><br />transalt.org/everyschool<br /><br />TA has 10,000 members and the ear of city agencies and elected officials.

				I&#039;m amused that a topic - Reckless Drivers is now about pedestrian bashing, which may be part of the issue.&nbsp; One of the great things about NYC is it&#039;s public transportation and liveability for people who choose to live a life sans cars.<br /><br />First let me assure you that I&#039;m not a jay walker.&nbsp; I try to cross with the cross walk signs, and frequently almost get run over because of people who are not giving the right of way, u turning or backing up.&nbsp; And I have walked in neighborhoods all over NY (literally) and this neighborhood is one of the worst.&nbsp; Go to Gleane Street and Roosevelt Avenue and try to cross with the walk sign and see what happens.&nbsp; One of the worst crossing areas there is - the other day 3 cars zoomed past even though I was clearly trying to cross and in the cross walk, I finally stepped out in front of the cross walk with a car speeding up to cut me off, after 3 cars had already done this.<br /><br />On an amusing note - a few months ago I saw an older woman with a walker crossing Roosevelt Avenue with the walk light, and the cars trying to turn on to Roosevelt - the cars started beeping their horns, and the woman came to a complete stop - and said I feel faint - I think I&#039;m going to have to rest here for a while.&nbsp; I am still enjoying that moment.

				Anything on Roosevelt under the train is going to be bad. Ditto for under 31st St. in Astoria. There&#039;s a lot for drivers to be distracted by. That&#039;s not a Jackson Heights phenomena. I had a boyfriend who once tried to encourage me to try parallel parking (something I&#039;m not very good at) on 31st St, and I told him he was nuts if I thought that&#039;s the place I was going to do that.

				Yes, drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians should all be more mindful -- and dare I say it? -- perhaps more courteous as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But there are still too many dangerous drivers on the streets, and we need some real enforcement of the law to protect us from them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Despite all of the hype of the Vision Zero era, police enforcement actions in the 115th Precinct against four driving behaviors that put pedestrians at risk (speeding, red light running, failure to yield to pedestrians, and illegal cell phone use) have not increased are collectively <span class="bbc_u">down</span> from where they were several years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;(To be precise, tickets for three of the categories are up, but tickets against illegal cell phone use are down sharply).&nbsp; There really has been no lasting uptick in effort by the police to keep our streets safe from dangerous drivers, largely because the police have limited resources, and efforts to hold drivers accountable in the courts are so rarely successful.<br /><br />The City Council has tried to pass legislation to give police and prosecutors more effective tools to deal with reckless drivers, but they&#039;re really at the limits of what they can do.&nbsp; New York State&#039;s laws dealing with reckless drivers are weak and out of date relative to the state of practice in other states.&nbsp; We need action in Albany to get stronger laws in the books to address unlicensed drivers who injure or kill, drivers who flee the scene of crashes, and drunk drivers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The city also needs greater authority to deploy speed cameras and red light enforcement cameras, both of which are extremely effective at saving lives by changing patterns of driver behavior.&nbsp; &nbsp;NYC has a highly effective program using automatic speed cameras for traffic enforcement, but state legislation caps their use to only 140 citywide, only at schools, and only during school hours.&nbsp; Families for Safe Streets, a coalition of families who have lost loved ones to traffic crashes in NYC, is calling for legislation to authorize a speed camera at every one of the 2,000 schools in the city, operating 24/7.&nbsp; I&#039;ll post more on this campaign when it becomes available.

				my office is on the edge of tribeca, one block from a police station and one block from a transit police station in the canal street E station.<br /><br />these cops are the worst, most blatantly law-breaking drivers imaginable. going the wrong way down one way streets, backwards through red lights -- and not just in patrol cars, personal cars as well.<br /><br />they also have a block of West Broadway, not a side street, claimed as parking. so rather than parallel park, they perpendicular park. on the street, and on the sidewalk, so that pedestrians have to walk on the street. and yes, they have their names stenciled, in paint, on those spaces.<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=14457.msg69757.html#msg69757">Quote from: Palermo on March 24, 2016, 09:59:39 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe no one follows the rules of the road because those enforcing them don&#039;t either.<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/video-nypd-van-fatally-hitting-man-contradicts-city-claim-article-1.2575945<br /><br />I cannot count how many times I saw a radio car roll through a red light, as if the fender of a car wouldn&#039;t break an arm or crush a spleen because a blue and white NYPD is emblazoned on its side.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Even though the lights say I can walk, I&#039;m constantly looking around for that one car whose driver doesn&#039;t want to wait for people walking. And I&#039;m constantly fed up with pedestrians not crossing when they&#039;re able to, simply because they think they have to wait for a car that&#039;s making a turn as fast as they can.<br /><br />Tonight my BF was almost hit by a young girl driving recklessly -- she made a turn into the crosswalk and only missed him because I pulled him back. I took down her license plate and called 311 to report to the Police, but what else can we do here?<br /><br />I&#039;m so sick and tired of reckless drivers. I&#039;m sick of having to speed up my walking or jump out of the way of oncoming vehicles, even when it is MY turn to walk across the road. <br /><br />Does anyone else have this problem?!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i think they should be charged heavily if they injure someone.&nbsp; motorists are still responsible for their behavior unless someone literally jumps in front of their car and they are totally unable to stop because of the sudden action.&nbsp; however, many of this turn offenders don&#039;t seem to feel it&#039;s their responsibility to slow down when someone is rightfully walking across the street.

My specific gripe is that no one seems to know how to make a left turn, especially on 37th Avenue. A driver shouldn&#039;t start the turn unless the crosswalk is clear, but around here they start, then stop for a pedestrian in the crosswalk and wave them through, all while blocking traffic headed in the opposite direction. And don&#039;t get me started on drivers who will do a spontaneous full-speed U-turn anywhere without warning just to nab a parking spot.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t understand why the 115th Precinct can&#039;t put together a sting operation every now and then and pull some of these lousy drivers off our local streets. I see dangerous acts like this almost every single day.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Or have alcohol checkpoints more frequently.&nbsp;
