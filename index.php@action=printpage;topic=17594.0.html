				I plan to hire our handyman on his day off to paint an average size bathroom that that has some slight damage on the ceiling and walls.&nbsp; I want to be certain that I pay him properly.&nbsp; Any ideas on what the price should be. I will be supplying the paint.&nbsp; Thank You.

				i got wildly varying estimates from three painters for a relatively small bathroom, ranging from $500 to nearly $2000 -- there was some damage, mostly the ceiling directly above the shower, and a bit on the wall in the area of the tub (above the tile). ended up with someone at the low end of that scale, but not the lowest.

				dssjh:&nbsp; Many thanks for your response.&nbsp; It&#039;s very helpful.&nbsp; Our handman who I&#039;m very friendly with won&#039;t give me a price and will tell me, &quot;give me whatever you like&quot;.&nbsp; He has to drive 1 hour each way on his day off.&nbsp; I will take this into consideration.&nbsp; Based on your helpful response, it won&#039;t be below $500.00.&nbsp;

				Most companies charge a minimum for bathroom painting or wallpapering -in this area it&#039;s around $600 (more for wallpaper). When you take into account the prep work and the fact that there&#039;s some damage, I would start with $800 as a fair price. I was quoted an average of $1600 for two small rooms with brand new walls and no damage.
