				I was told by a friend he heard an explosion last night by 37th Ave &amp; 83rd St at 11:30pm and heard sirens but didn&#039;t know where it was at.<br /><br />Does anyone know anything about this?

				I heard it too! Around 11:30pm, it caused several car alarms to go off. Shortly after I heard a bunch of sirens. Anyone know what happened?

				Yeah, it was pretty crazy. Manhole explosion on 82nd Street between 35th and 37th. It lit a couple cars on fire. FDNY was there within minutes dousing them. The scary thing was that the underground infrastructure extends into the adjacent residential building, but from what I could tell the fire was contained.

				This happened on my block.&nbsp; Yep, manhole explosion that then caused a car to catch fire.&nbsp; I was coming home from a concert at MSG to see fire trucks parked by my building and a fireman going into our basement.&nbsp; From what I hear, one of the buildings nearest to the explosion is still having electrical issues because of it.&nbsp;
