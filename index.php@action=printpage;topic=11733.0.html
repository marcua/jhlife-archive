				It seems that Verizon laid the FIOS cable on 35th avenue at 74th street. I asked the Super about this and he said we are not getting FIOS. What are the rules/laws about getting FIOS into a building? Is there a city agency that oversees these things?

				Bump. Would love to know which buildings accept or which building&#039;s supers/boards refuse to allow fios to come in.<br /><br />If supers or boards or management companies refuse (perhaps through corrupt kickbacks?), then we should publicise this: <strong>it&#039;s a poorer deal from shareholders</strong> and residents should insist that it happen. I would pay 2% more for an apartment with FIOS!! Seriously, TWC sucks that badly in this hood. I have regular outages at night.

				I haven&#039;t looked into FIOS, but did ask my super about DirecTV last year. He explained that the building was open to it, but in order to get it we&#039;d need to round up 35 units to commit - that&#039;s about 20% of the building&#039;s units. I imagine the building would have a similar policy for FIOS. It makes sense. There&#039;s a certain amount of building infrastructure that would need to be upgraded - cabling to all floors, ports on the roof, and for DirecTV they&#039;d need to install and maintain the dishes as well. Seems like an expensive endeavor if only a handful of people are interested. The super also mentioned that he had tried to drum up interest a few years ago - he had wanted DirecTV to get some soccer channels - and he was only able to get 5 signatures. So we didn&#039;t bother. But I imagine this is a common policy.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is a rental building. I imagine co-ops have a lot more flexibility to bring in new technology if they can get the board to approve and if they&#039;re willing to shell out the $.

				I spoke to Verizon at the annual Co-Op Expo regarding FiOS in apartment buildings. If the building is willing to provide access, Verizon will install it.&nbsp; Their preferred pathway from the street is the same as TimeWarner (direct buried cable terminating in distribution equipment in the basement).&nbsp; That said, property management would need to ensure that they provide access through the existing vertical pathways (ducts/conduits) as cable.&nbsp; I suspect the issue in most buildings will be congestion in the existing pathways filled with coax.&nbsp; Our building doesn&#039;t allow sattelite dishes or exterior wiring, so this continues to be a challenge.
