				Hi--anybody have a custom framing shop to recommend in the neighborhood? I could swear I&#039;ve walked by numerous frame places in the past, but now that I&#039;m actually in need of one, I can&#039;t find any.&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!

				I&#039;ve used Angel Frame to get two small paintings custom-framed. Good variety of frames, great results, and very straight-forward and professional experience. I think they had asked for cash payment for a small discount.

				Thanks for the feedback. Looks like there&#039;s nothing actually in JH. I may look into Angel, given the positive reviews here but it will be a hike.

				Well, it&#039;s kind of generic and definitely not a fine arts framer, but there&#039;s the combo photo joint &amp; frame shop on 37th between (I think) 78th and 77th. Within a block of there anyway. If it&#039;s a poster or photographs, it will be OK, but he doesn&#039;t do studio hingeing and you have to be really insistent about archival mattes and UV protective plexi, if that&#039;s what you want.

				I&#039;ve used Borja Picture Frames, 88-11 31st Avenue, several times and been very pleased. Just had work done on an antique mirror. While the frame selection is limited I&#039;ve always found something I wanted, and Carlos Borja is a real gentleman. Rates are reasonable. <br /><br />

				Angel Frames is very good. He is there years. Very honest man. A craftsman. Always plenty of parking on Roosevelt, and the Q32 stops right by the store.
