					In order to keep the doors open Queens Pride House launched its SAVE QUEENS PRIDE HOUSE campaign.&nbsp; Through a combination of austerity, volunteers, new funding, and fundraising we have pushed the viability of the center forward one year!&nbsp; We exceeded our fundraising goal in 2010 and raised $12,000!&nbsp; Our goal for 2011 is $20,000.<br /><br />Queens Pride House announces the appointment of a new interim executive director.<br /><br />Article from Queens Chronicle:<br /><br />Queens Pride House gets new director<br />by Elizabeth Daley, Editor<br />Queens Chronicle<br />1.20.2011<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; After more than a decade of service to the organization, Daniel Castellanos stepped down as executive director of Queens Pride House on Monday, the organization announced. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanos helped found the only lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community center in the borough in 1997 and led the organization since April 2009. He will be succeeded by Peter Pavich as interim executive director. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œIâ€™ve been with Queens Pride House since the beginning,â€ Castellanos said in a statement. â€œItâ€™s now time for me to move on, as I focus my efforts on finishing my dissertation,â€ he added. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanos is pursuing a doctorate in public health at Columbia University and has received a fellowship to write his doctoral thesis on homeless youth of color as he prepares to embark upon a new career as a health researcher. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œI would like to thank Daniel for his many years of service to Queens Pride House,â€ said Pauline Park, president of the board of directors, who, along with Castellanos and Treasurer Charles Ober, are the only three original founding members of the organization still directly involved in its operations. â€œDaniel will be missed,â€ Ober said. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Castellanosâ€™ successor, Pavich, has spent the last six years as the executive director of Helping Hands Unlimited, a Brooklyn-based HIV/AIDS housing provider, as well as president and CEO of Pavich Consultants, a grant writing a program development firm. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich will be working with QPH on a short-term basis while the board searches for a permanent director. â€œPeter has enormous experience in program and organizational development,â€ Park said, adding that it will be nice to have his perspective regarding the organization and its future. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich has developed HIV prevention programs for elders, youth and members of the LGBT community. He is an entrepreneur and enjoys leading organizations during transitional phases, Park said. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œPeterâ€™s experience as interim executive director of the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Community Center of Central Florida is of particular relevance in his work for Queens Pride House,â€ said Ober in a statement. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pavich received a bachelorâ€™s degree in nursing from the University of Florida in 1991, his masterâ€™s degree in public health from the University of South Florida in 1994, and a Ph.D. in public health from New York University in 2006. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Park said QPH is working with Pavich to develop a timeline for his service. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Queens Pride House is located in Jackson Heights and serves more than 6,000 clients and conducts health support, education and referral programs, youth training, and cultural and social programming. To obtain more information about the organization and its services visit queenspridehouse.org or call (718) 429-5309. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />FILE PHOTO: Daniel Castellanos <br /><br /><a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20454597&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20454597&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574903&amp;rfi=6</a><br />

					NEW YORK TIMES<br /><br />August 13, 2010<br />Gay Community Center in Queens Is at Crossroads<br />By FERNANDA SANTOS<br />The Queens Pride House might go unnoticed if not for the rainbow flag that sways from one of its windows over 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights. It sits upstairs from an Indian restaurant, a Korean deli, an Italian bakery owned by Colombians and a driving school named Hawaii that is run by a man from Bangladesh â€” a snapshot of Queensâ€™s ethnic jumble, which the organization has embraced. <br /><br />Technically, Pride House is a community center for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. But it is in fact much more. Day laborers can be found using its computer lab, and a Nepalese dance troupe rehearses in the same room where H.I.V.-positive mothers and fathers meet once a month. <br /><br />For lesbian Latinas, it is an analystâ€™s divan. For teenagers for whom being gay is a closely held secret, it is like the home of a best friend who will cover for them when they sneak out with a lover. <br /><br />â€œWeâ€™re not just this or just that,â€ said Pride Houseâ€™s executive director, Daniel Castellanos. â€œWeâ€™re immigrant, weâ€™re working-class, weâ€™re family, weâ€™re gay. What we have here is a place where a lot of identities intersect and interact.â€ <br /><br />Queens Pride has come a long way since its humble beginnings 13 years ago, in a tiny office at Queensborough Hall. Now, unexpected financial troubles are forcing it to confront basic questions: Who will it be able to serve? How much will it be able to offer? <br /><br />Even its very survival is up in the air. It is already living under austere conditions. Its staff has been decimated â€” there are three part-time employees left, out of the two full-time and six part-time workers it used to have. It is open five days a week, instead of six, and for 8 hours daily, not its usual 11. <br /><br />Rent, utilities and other expenses were once split among Queens Pride House and a pair of partner organizations, but those organizations have folded. A private nonprofit that has been one of its most reliable benefactors, the Paul Rapoport Foundation, will close too, after suffering its own share of losses. The state cut its financing by $83,000 for the fiscal year that started April 1 and still owes the group $18,000 in reimbursements. City Council financing dropped this year to roughly $5,000, or one-quarter of last yearâ€™s total. <br /><br />Queens Pride House started the year with a budget of $280,000 but cut it by nearly $100,000 months ago to avert closing. It still faces a $30,000 deficit. <br /><br />Pride House received no money from one of its founders, Councilman Daniel Dromm, or a former board member, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who are both openly gay. <br /><br />The two lawmakers said the cityâ€™s own fiscal woes resulted in their share of discretionary financing being significantly cut, so they had to be selective. Mr. Van Bramer said his priorities were organizations in his district, which includes the Woodside and Sunnyside sections of Queens. Meanwhile, Mr. Dromm, who represents Jackson Heights, said he contributed to other gay groups whose leaders made personal appeals for help. <br /><br />â€œPride House sent me an application for funding, but they never asked for a meeting,â€ he explained. â€œThey never communicated to me what was going on.â€ <br /><br />At a recent meeting to discuss the organizationâ€™s future â€” attended by Pride House regulars, community organizers and gay men who live in the neighborhood â€” Rafael Ortiz, a board member, told the standing-room crowd: â€œIf you donâ€™t like what they did to us, speak up in November. But focus your energy now on figuring out how to get through the crisis at hand.â€ <br /><br />And so they did, offering idea after idea to keep the place going. Could money be donated through the Pride Houseâ€™s Web site? What if volunteers filled some of the staffing voids? Why not start a fund-raising committee or rent meeting space to other groups? <br /><br />â€œAll options are being considered,â€ Mr. Castellanos said later. â€œThe one thing we know for sure is that we donâ€™t want to go back to being one person in an office.â€ <br /><br />For Kevin Wehle, who lives in Flushing, Queens, and Audwin Edwards, who lives in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, that would mean losing the space where the Bear Den, a group of self-described hairy, overweight gay men, gather for some unpretentious socializing. â€œThe gay men of Chelsea are so thin and muscular and clean-shaven,â€ said Mr. Wehle, 37. â€œWe can be more accepting of our bodies here.â€ <br /><br />There are others to whom the Pride House is both living room and refuge. Nancy Nava, 21, and Kenia Reyes, 25, who belong to a support group called Las Buenas Amigas, Spanish for â€œthe good friends,â€ said they felt at ease talking about their parentsâ€™ refusal to accept their homosexuality, their loneliness or occasional thoughts of suicide. To a 61-year-old widow from Ecuador and a 52-year-old single mother from Colombia, it is the only place they openly discuss what it is like to live with H.I.V. <br /><br />Lisa Sarkisian, who runs a meeting for transgender individuals, said, â€œYou know you can come here as you are and know you wonâ€™t be judged.â€ <br /><br />Mr. Castellanos recalled when Bolivia held its presidential elections and consular officials mistakenly set up a polling station in the largest of Pride Houseâ€™s rooms, which the Bear Den had reserved for its annual party. <br /><br />He was on vacation, he said, but found himself on the phone, dealing with an impasse: the officials said they risked invalidating all ballots if they moved the voting booths to the smaller lounge. The gay men said the lounge did not have enough space to accommodate them. <br /><br />â€œThey got to compromise and for a while, you had big gay men chatting on one side of the room and Bolivian immigrants voting on the other,â€ Mr. Castellanos said. â€œTo me, that really represents what weâ€™re about: equality for all.â€ <br /><br />

					QUEEENS CHRONICLE<br />07/29/2010<br />Queens Pride House tries to stay afloat<br />by Mark Lord , Chronicle Contributor<br /><br />&nbsp;Queens Pride House director, Daniel Castellanos addresses a crowd at Tuesday nightâ€™s meeting. PHOTO BY PAULINE PARK<br />&nbsp;Queens Pride House, the only community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered communities in the borough, is waging a battle to prevent itself from becoming yet another victim of the difficult economy. At an emergency community meeting on Tuesday night, organizers suggested that unless the groupâ€™s financial situation improves, and quickly, it may be forced to shut its doors for good next spring.<br />&nbsp;Nestled between a laundromat and a mini-market, a couple of flights up from a beauty salon, a billboard outside QPH touts the organization as â€œWorking together against injustice, discrimination and violence in all forms.â€<br />&nbsp;â€œWeâ€™re a young organization,â€ said treasurer Charles Ober, â€œand we have a huge fiscal challenge.â€<br />&nbsp;QPH opened its first office in Queens Borough Hall in 1997. After years of identifying funding sources and community needs, the organization opened for service in Woodside in 2001.<br />&nbsp;â€œWe wanted to be who we are here in our own neighborhood,â€ said Daniel Castellanos, one of the original founding members and current director of the organization.<br />&nbsp;In 2006, the group outgrew its space and joined two other community-minded organizations to create the Diversity Center of Queens at its current location in Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp;QPH provides a variety of health-related programs and services, as well as social and cultural programming, in areas such as substance abuse, immigration, employment, healthcare, legal assistance and youth services. The organization served a total of 4,588 people last year alone.<br />&nbsp;Now, QPH is calling upon the community it has assisted for over a decade to come to its rescue.<br />&nbsp;â€œWe came out of a grassroots structure,â€ explained Ober, â€œand we still run as one.â€ The groupâ€™s estimated annual operating budget is $300,000.<br />&nbsp;Originally, all staff members were volunteers.Since the move from Woodside, several individuals have become paid employees.Recently, because of budget issues, five of the organizationâ€™s eight paid workers have been laid off.<br />&nbsp;Like many other funded organizations, QPH seems to have been caught up in a bureaucratic tug of war.<br />&nbsp;â€œThe governor wanted certain things that the legislature refused to pass, so the governor vetoed what the legislature wanted to pass,â€ said Ober.<br />&nbsp;As a result, most of the $83,000 that had been anticipated from the state is, at least temporarily, on hold.<br />&nbsp;Inequities in city funding have left the organization wanting, as well.<br />&nbsp;In a financial report distributed by Ober at the meeting, statistics indicate that QPH received only $5,000 from Councilwoman Julissa Ferrerasâ€™s (D-Corona) office for the current year, placing it in a distant last place for funding among the five boroughs LGBT centers. Its Manhattan counterpart, by comparison, received $225,000 from the City Council.<br />&nbsp;Last year, QPH received a total of $12,500 from three council members.<br />&nbsp;Compounding the groupâ€™s woes is the fact that the two other organizations that had been sharing rent expenses have both gone out of business, according to Pauline Park, president of the board of directors of QPH.<br />&nbsp;â€œWe now have the full burden of the rent,â€ she said.<br />&nbsp;If Queens were a city, it would have the ninth largest gay population in the United States. Castellanos said â€œOur needs cut across many groups. We are an immigrant community; we have many issues of diversity.We donâ€™t want to lose that.â€<br />&nbsp;In an attempt to overcome the current crisis, the organization is considering sharing its office space with other organizations.An Internet fund-raising campaign is in the works and fundraising committees are being formed.Volunteers have been recruited to replace the laid-off staff members, but more are needed.<br />&nbsp;Despite the severity of the situation, the organizationâ€™s leaders remain die- hard optimists.<br />&nbsp;â€œIâ€™m thrilled we had over 50 very enthusiastic community members here,â€ Park said. â€œI was excited by all the positive energy. By the end of next spring weâ€™ll see if we can keep our doors open.â€<br />&nbsp;â€œWe will stand based on the grass roots in this room,â€ said Ober, regarding the standing-room-only crowd.â€œWe expect some of our money to be released by the state.â€<br />&nbsp;â€œIt is disappointing that we were moving in the direction of a dream.We donâ€™t want to slow down. We want to make that dream a reality,â€ said Castellanos.<br />&nbsp;For further information on Queens Pride House, or to make a donation, visit queenspridehouse.org
