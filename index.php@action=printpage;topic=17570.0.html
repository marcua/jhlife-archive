				<strong>Hello JH Life!</strong> You might remember me from posts such as &quot;Hey the Queensboro is coming soon!&quot;&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Well, guess what - it <em>is</em> coming soon, and we are super excited about it.<br /><br />For those of you who might not know the story, myself and two other neighborhood guys have been trying to open up a great neighborhood restaurant/bar for several years. We&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights for years, we&#039;re parents of Jackson Heights kids, and we&#039;re into the Jackson Heights community - I&#039;m part of the JH Green Alliance that helped bring the Rory Staunton field into existence, helped make the 78th Street Plaza a reality, etc... we&#039;re involved in Farm Spot, in our kids&#039; schools, we hang out in the neighborhood and we love it here. <br /><br />We finally found a space, signed the lease, raised some money and started construction, and then ran into delays and roadblocks. We&#039;ve worked our way through them all, and we are finally almost there! Construction is completed, our partnership remains strong, and we have closed out almost all of our permits. It&#039;s difficult to say exactly when we&#039;ll be able to open our doors because the DoB works in mysterious ways, but it&#039;s definitely <em>not </em>a long time away now - a matter of weeks! <br /><br />I must say with all sincerity that it&#039;s looking really great!<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/D1CsRC1.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/3P1omgd.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/d6vf5Xi.jpg)<br /><br />We&#039;re going to have mostly Queens beers, a delicious range of crafted cocktails, and - what I&#039;m most excited about - amazing food by Chef Tony Liu who has worked as the executive chef in several Keith McNally restaurants. He is the real deal, his food is going to be delicious and exciting, with nods to the neighborhood as well as seasonal dishes using green market ingredients. To give you an idea of what the menu will be, we&#039;re structuring it as an American style neighborhood bistro, and to top it off we have a <strong>monster</strong> pizza oven that&#039;s going to be put to good use, and not just for pizza!<br /><br />We&#039;re going to hire locals as much as possible (almost all of the resumes we&#039;ve gotten so far have been from people who live nearby), we&#039;re keeping the prices reasonable, we&#039;re going to be there for small groups, big groups, parties, special occasions, afternoon snacks, <strong>brunch!!!</strong>, dinner, lunch, quick drinks, slow drinks, late night drinks, romantic dinners, family gatherings, great music at a reasonable volume, a place to hold the meetings for your community group, to plan political action, to impress a date... <br /><br /><strong>But now we need your help, Jackson Heights!</strong><br /><br />All the delays we ran into have been tough, so it would be very helpful to us at this point to get some money to help pay for the last few things that we need. We have in the past asked some close friends to buy gift cards that they can use later - basically paying now for future drinks and food - and we&#039;re widening the net in the hope of raising more funds now. We have also asked for investments from friends and family, if that is something you&#039;d like to find out more about feel free to contact me directly (dudley@thequeensboro.com), but if you&#039;re able to help us by purchasing a gift card now, we&#039;d <em>really</em> appreciate it.<br /><br />You can do that here:<br /><br /><strong>http://thequeensboro.com/support/ (http://thequeensboro.com/support/)</strong><br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll keep an eye on this thread and answer any questions you may have, or anything else that comes up.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Dudley<br /><br />

				WOW--the space looks beautiful. This is very exciting.&nbsp; I just want to say I totally support the advanced purchase &quot;gift card&quot; approach to contributing to a business and I will purchase one myself.&nbsp; Your webpage makes it look like $250 is the minimum purchase, but once I click I can select any amount. Perhaps you might want to make that clearer on your webpage so as not to scare off smaller contributors.

				Good point re: Addictive Wind &amp; Tapas, which is excellent! My only issue with them is they are pretty far from our apartment and the first time we walked up there, we couldn&#039;t get in, they were fully occupied. We wound up eating at a nearby establishment that I suspect gave me food poisoning...but of course that&#039;s not Addictive&#039;s fault! I just wish they were closer--the one time we did eat there, we thought the food and ambiance with both excellent. In fact, I am considering going there tonight, if the wind allows.

				I have lived in Jackson Heights my entire life. I used to buy my comic books at Discount Books on 77th and my albums at Numbers Records and Tapes on the corner of 78th. Such a great place to grow up. I have watched so many of my classmates, neighbors,friends, brothers and sisters migrate to Long Island. While I am happy for them, I would never leave my neighborhood. I live <em>and</em> work in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Our children have gone to <strong>local</strong> schools in Jackson Heights and, along with my regular job, I have 25 years experience in the bar business. Like all of us, I have seen bar/restaurants come and go, all with the best intentions, hopes and aspirations. Anyway....I dropped my maiden comment on this site a couple of days ago about having a television at the bar... just as a curiosity. I wanted to see who would pounce on something as abhorrent as a television in a restaurant. Many of you took it upon yourselves to basically tell the owners &quot;no way&quot;. I suppose some people don&#039;t want a television in the place because they would rather sit across from each other and stare at their phones. A true neighborhood bar/restaurant requires a community fabric. Not a niche market. Remember, the Queensboro will be open 7 days a week, hopefully busy everyday. Television or not, I will be there frequently, and I have told hundreds of people how awesome the place is going to be and how great the owners are.&nbsp; Although some of you may not like crowds, these guys WANT the place crowded. I personally would love to walk into the place as a regular and say &quot;hi&quot; to the staff, the bar crowd , the bus boys, the dishwashers, the owners and the diners. <em>That</em> is the fiber in our neighborhood fabric... And everyone in this neighborhood I have spoken to agrees with me.&nbsp; For those who think a television turns the place into something less than, you are misguided. It doesn&#039;t turn the place into a sports bar. And it certainly doesn&#039;t turn the place into some of the more &quot;low quality establishments&quot; along NB.&nbsp; Perhaps Swims with Two Wolves, or whatever, on 37th,&nbsp; will be more your cup of tea if and when it ever comes to fruition. But in all honesty, I look forward to meeting everyone at the bar. All of us together, as a community. I will be the guy with a Coors Light in front of me, 15 friends around me and the Met game on above me on the 52 inch, or I will be having dinner with my family. The place looks unbelievable and I wish Dudley, Michael and all the others involved, the best of luck. See you when the doors open.

				Well, each to his own I guess regarding TVs in restaurants, but I don&#039;t see why 85er won&#039;t allow for another opinion besides his. So those who regard TVs in restaurants as something that detracts from the dining experience are &quot;wrong&quot;? I guess he feels that this is a snobby, snooty attitude that doesn&#039;t belong in JH.&nbsp; I could pronounce him &quot;wrong&quot; on that count, too. I don&#039;t see why the friendly neighborhood restaurant vibe can&#039;t exist without a TV, but that seems to be the suggestion. But I think he is also suggesting that the place would want to appeal to the widest variety of customers, and lots of them--like 85er--would want a TV. Oh well, as long as the food is good and the TV is soundless, I guess I could live with it. It&#039;s big enough that one wouldn&#039;t have to be near the TV if it&#039;s at the bar.

				Instead of becomming enraged , which I find silly, at the subject of televisions in restaurants, I would just like to say that there is simply an over abundance of that in our &#039;hood, and to suggest that no television signifies a snobbish establishment, is equally as silly. There are many, many casual restaurants, of all kinds, that do not have screens. That being said, let us not forget that futbul/ soccer in latin cultures is incredibly important, and most of the establishments in JH with screens are south american restaurants. Management clearly uses this to draw in more patrons, make money.<br />Anyway, would be cool to have a few that don&#039;t have screens, and instead some appropriate background music that suits the vibe of the place :)

				You can do ALL of that stuff without a TV. If you need a TV in front of you to start a conversation with someone, I dunno, that just seems very limited to me. In my experience, it&#039;s a great conversation STOPPER, unless it&#039;s a sporting event. And, as others have pointed out, there are plenty of other places where that is an option. Is your only satisfaction in having a TV in EVERY eating or drinking establishment you patronize?<br /><br />And speaking of patronizing, nice touch with the &quot;cell phone in front of you&quot;; if the &quot;low quality&quot; remark bugged you, you should say so, rather than indulging in your own nuanced insults.<br /><br />Since Mike has worked in a number of restaurants that have NOT had TVs and still managed to stay busy, I don&#039;t think he&#039;s going to have to work <em>too</em> hard to get folks in the front door. Particularly since they really seem to be meeting an often voiced wish on this board for the last 10 or so years I&#039;ve been visiting it.<br /><br />Too each his own, maybe we&#039;ll get to raise a glass together if everything&#039;s reruns and you&#039;ve seen it all already...

It&#039;s really basic civility when you sit down to eat with your friends or family to put the darn phone away. Get it off the table. Put it on vibrate. If you can (and you really, really probably can), turn it off or put it in airplane mode. Chances are slim anyone&#039;s world or your own is going to fall apart if you don&#039;t respond to a text within the next 60 minutes.<br /><br />I hate TVs in restaurants because moving images are distracting. They draw a human&#039;s eye even when you don&#039;t want to look at them. And it&#039;s especially whacky that 9/10 times, close captioning is turned off and the volume is muted. Why exactly is that TV on again? <br /><br />Staring blankly at a TV screen does not encourage community. It does not encourage anyone to interact with anyone else, which is sort of necessary for community building. The exception is sports bars. And other specialties like the gay bars that do viewings of Drag Race.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> But I think he is also suggesting that the place would want to appeal to the widest variety of customers, and lots of them--like 85er--would want a TV.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If that is what 85er is suggesting, 85er would probably be wrong. The number of potential customers that would not consider going to eat a nice, casual Bistro without a TV is probably quite negligible. I don&#039;t think an American Bistro - which is how they are describing themselves -- is targeting people who need a TV to stare at while they shove food in their face. If you want to eat some place with the widest appeal, there&#039;s always McDonald&#039;s. (which doesn&#039;t have TVs either.)

				I would prefer not to have TV&#039;s in the restaurant area but would think they are preferable in the bar area if you are looking to draw a bar crowd.&nbsp; There are too many times&nbsp; when there might be a soccer, football or baseball game&nbsp; people might&nbsp; want to watch.<br /><br />In any case sometimes I think this board over estimates how much influence it will have over neighborhood&nbsp; decisions.&nbsp; I like the board to&nbsp; share information but in reality it is a very very small percentage of&nbsp; the people who will visit the neighborhood establishments on which it is commenting. I am guessing there are 25-30 regular posters on this board and how many times a week will these people eat at the Queensboro? The&nbsp; decision on whether to have or not have TV&#039;s&nbsp; will be determined by the customer market.

				I&#039;ve seen some pretty unappetizing stuff broadcast on TV screens in eating establishments. <br /><br />The customer is a captive audience. You can&#039;t change the channel. Besides soccer which is usually repeats of games already played, I&#039;ve actually had to stomach a bloody boxing match, insects and reptiles doing disgusting things to survive, women-demeaning music videos, to name just a few.<br /><br />Two, it seems that TVs are set to entertain the staff more than the clientele. Anyway, that&#039;s who is usually looking at it. A smart restaurateur should not encourage staff to be watching TV. <br /><br />Plus, it is believed to be bad for your waistline to eat while preoccupied. <br /><br />so yeah, TVs can cheapen and erode the dining experience.<br /><br />Management can turn on a big-screen for showing advance-advertised real-time matches and political debates, as well as newsworthy coverage of catastrophic events (i&#039;m recalling how helpful TV was on 9/11). In fact, I would recommend something like that as a community benefit.

				Just open, doesn&#039;t matter if there are TV&#039;s or not. I wouldn&#039;t mind it during football season. Can just leave them muted so they aren&#039;t bothering everyone. I&#039;ve seen tons of nice places with TVs at the bar and no one bats an eye.<br /><br />I also disagree that they aren&#039;t a conversation starter. I&#039;ve used them in that capacity before if I&#039;m at a bar by myself to talk to the person next to me. Not required, but it&#039;s an elegant way to break the ice.

				Hello all! First of all, thanks so much to everyone who is buying gift cards, the response has been way beyond our expectations and extremely helpful to us right now. It&#039;s truly heartwarming!<br /><br />I thought it would be good to provide an update on what&#039;s been happening with The Q. I&#039;ll try to do this more often as we approach our opening date.<br /><br />Basically, right now we are working with the DoB in order to close out all of our permits. We have expediters working on this for us, because it&#039;s a very complicated job. One of the reasons that caused us delays is that the existing status of the building was very convoluted with regards to permits and open applications, which forced us to have to use expediters that weren&#039;t our first choice.<br /><br />Long story short - we&#039;re almost there. Every day brings another victory, one more dragon slain, another check on the list of permits that we need, this is nice to see. <br /><br />Now, see below for some...<br /><div>BIG NEWS!</div> <br /><br />We&#039;re starting to look for staff! Check out Mike&#039;s post over here: <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=17621.0<br /><br />Do you know anyone who would like a job at The Queensboro? Would you? We&#039;d love to hear from you, and please tell your friends if you think they&#039;d be interested - we&#039;re going to need a lot of people and we want to be able to hire some good folks who would like to be part of something awesome.

				Hi! Thanks so much for the positive vibes everyone, it&#039;s really nice to read and hear things like that.<br /><br />We&#039;re still plodding ahead, running into trolls, dragons and various zombies that we&#039;re defeating at every step of the way. Sometimes I look at what we&#039;ve been through and the hurdles we&#039;ve had to cross and it amazes me that we&#039;re still hopeful - and we are, very much so! <br /><br />In fact, we only have ONE MORE THING to get before we can open legally to the public. It&#039;s a big one, and it&#039;s complicated, but it <em>could</em> happen quickly. More likely it won&#039;t, based on our history, but like I said... hope. <br /><br />So keep your fingers crossed, and if you have a spare fireball feel free to cast it at our foes.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/S8Xvg5W.jpg?3)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>Hey, is that a pizza oven in your pocket or...?</em></span><br />

				We went last night. <br /><br />Not sure Dudley was ready for the crowd. There were two elementary-aged boys serving as hosts, explaining that this was a soft opening with a limited menu. A young girl--maybe 6?--was helping bus tables, carrying one plate at a time VERY CAREFULLY. It was charming as hell, if somewhat chaotic. Dudley might have been the only person taking orders? <br /><br />Anyway, the pizzas were good and the snap pea salad was lovely. I had an excellent cocktail. I saw loads of neighbors who were clearly thrilled to finally have a place like this. <br /><br />Highly recommend a visit if you haven&#039;t been. I&#039;m looking forward to returning in the next couple of weeks. <br /><br />Congrats to Dudley and team. <br /><br />

				We went tonight. Holy crap this was great. <br /><br />Pizza could stand toe-to-toe with any good neighborhood neapolitan-style pizzeria in BK (I would compare it favorably, for example with fornino in williamsburg) . The snap pea salad was spring on a plate. The wine was reasonably priced for quality glasses ($8-14), generous pours, and even had a beaujolais &quot;san soufre&quot; (without sulfur) which was fresh and quaffable. <br /><br />The space is warm and well thought out with bar seating, regular tables by the giant-light-filed&nbsp; windows and an interior section of caramel-colored banquettes. A Beautiful neighborhood bistro, walkable to for most of jackson heights!<br /><br /><br />They were rushed for the 2nd night - it was slow and there were definitely service hiccups, but&nbsp; once they get their &quot;new restaurant kinks&quot; sorted, I look forward to even greater things. <br /><br />GO. SUPPORT this amazing business. Exactly what people on this board and neighborhood have been clamoring for for years! <br /><br />Finally a neighborhood restaurant for people who want <strong>good</strong> wine with <strong>good </strong>food in a modern, convivial, tv-free atmosphere.

				I can&#039;t wait to go! It&#039;s very challenging to run a restaurant, so I hope Dudley is getting all the expert help and advice he needs for ongoing success. There is definitely a solid market for what he is offering here in JH, as evidenced by the clamoring crowds already lining up for The Queensboro.<br /><br />It reminds me of when we finally got a real restaurant on the sleepy and small commercial strip in my former neighborhood in Upper Manhattan, and the first night they were open there was a line snaking up the street. It was so crowded they resorted to seating unrelated parties together. That place has now expanded and is going strong after 25 years. I hope The Queensboro has the same success. We will be there very soon!

				Hi! Wow... it&#039;s been amazing so far, thank you to everyone who came out and for all the nice comments on here. Yes we&#039;re still in &quot;soft opening&quot; mode, so some things need to be worked out, and polished. We&#039;re working on that, and we want everyone to have a good experience, so we are going to limit our seating and selection for dinner over the next few days while we continue to train our staff and set the restaurant up. <br /><br />So for tonight and the next few days we will be open from 6 onwards for drinks, with a limited menu for a limited number of people. Feel free to stop by and say hi. Thanks for your patience and support!<br /><br />

They are extremely mindful people, I am certain there are vegetarian things on the menu when you go --- now, if it is still available by the time you arrive is another story...

				We’re on vacation in Peru, but forgot to share that we ended up stopping by last sunday. Short of an order mixup, which resulted in a different pasta coming out, everything was fantastic. My wife ended up eating my dish. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our meal and although we didn’t get cocktails, the rosé was dry and refreshing. Loved to see all the local beers from my old stomping grounds (LIC). LIC Beer Project, Rockaway Brewery, Transmitter, and Singlecut all on tap. Love the local Love. And then of course the space. The space. Very tastefully designed. Looking forward to more dinners in the future, and of course BRUUUUUNCH!

				Hello! A couple of quick notes:<br /><br />It&#039;s been an amazing few days, we&#039;ve worked out the issues we experienced during the first few days of our soft opening. We are grateful to everyone for their patience during that time, some folks had to wait a long time for their food but hopefully they understood that it was just the first few days of business for a big, full-service restaurant.<br /><br />The menu has been expanding every day, as has our staff - and we have some excellent people working for us in the kitchen, behind the bar and on the floor. <br /><br />For those of you who preferred to wait until we are fully open before checking us out, we&#039;re ready to make <strong>Monday June 11th our official opening date!</strong><br /><br />On that note, we will be closed on Sunday (tomorrow). We need to sleep at least 3 or 4 hours a week so we figured we&#039;d have a little event for our investors, and then give everyone the night off. <br /><br />We look forward to seeing <strong>everyone!</strong>&nbsp; ;)

				Had a nice meal at the Queensboro Monday night. The restaurant is spacious, comfortable and full of light. The supreme pizza and chicken my wife and I had were delicious and reasonably priced. And they made a killer manhattan. For the official opening the place was packed, with a lot of kids on hand early on. It was a terrific experience and I look forward to going back to try more of the menu or just stop by for a drink. This much-anticipated restaurant is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Congratulations, Dudley!

				Went last night--loved it! Exactly what I&#039;d been wishing for in JH! I just wish it were closer to my apartment, but I&#039;ll manage to get there plenty, I&#039;m sure. I enjoyed the by-the-glass Chardonnay and the fusilli, which was delicious. There were loads of families with children there, and just really a lot of people when I went around 7 PM. Most of the tables were full, but it&#039;s quite big, so I think chances are good there will be a table available whenever you go.

				Went again for a more elaborate meal and we were seated in close proximity first to two parties we knew, followed by two parties we didn&#039;t know, but wound up chatting with. Very friendly atmosphere, and this time I can recommend the swordfish and the pineapple upside down cake. Oddly, they were not equipped to serve coffee with dessert for some reason--I guess they are still working out the kinks. Had a great time--the place was jumping.

				Well, my family and I have been there twice and while I love the vibe, and its been great to sit near neighbors I know and to meet new friends (in the section where tables are very close to each other), I would have to say the actual menu is...a work in progress. The swordfish (not on the menu last night), fusilli, fluke and leek salad were delicious.But last night several of us had the scallops and they were drenched in too much pepper.&nbsp; That marred what would have otherwise been a tasty apple/corn sauce (don&#039;t remember the exact ingredients, forgive me foodies!).&nbsp; The first time, I had the roast chicken and I must say it was serviceable but underwhelming, nothing special. This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and we are thrilled to have it around and are rooting for it, so I hope honest feedback will help.

				^what you&#039;re describing isn&#039;t a menu that is a work in progress, but rather food prepared in a way you didn&#039;t like. If enough customers give similar feedback, or just don&#039;t order those dishes again, preparation of the food may change or perhaps it will be a menu item that is switched out for something that sells better.

				Great, thanks, and thanks for reading comments and being open to feedback! Eggplant pizza was another dish that was well liked by our group, and also the desserts: pineapple upside down cake, strawberry shortcake, and the assorted cookies. I&#039;ve been three times so far and do expect to be a frequent customer. <br /><br />Service is very friendly and helpful, too. When our server was a bit overwhelmed or just forgot to bring a second drink that was requested, another employee noticed me looking around, jumped in to help, and brought the drink right away. (I want the wine with the food, not after I&#039;ve finished, and that wasn&#039;t happening.) Much appreciated. <br /><br />And as long as I am commenting and you are reading (at some point), please consider that some people really need food that is simpler and less highly spiced than is currently in fashion. I go to restaurants at times where almost every dish has jalapenos or chipotle or chilies or curry or something like that thrown in. For health reasons, I can&#039;t eat those things. Delicate stomach. And in this neighborhood especially, finding the kind of food I need in restaurants can be challenging. Which is only one reason I&#039;m so happy you have finally arrived! <br /><br />A nice grilled fish dish (like your swordfish) or roast chicken (with crispy skin if possible!) would be great to have on your menu permanently.&nbsp; A meal-size salad with grilled chicken, salmon or shrimp is another thing I often order when dining out, and a great option for people who want lighter meals. Also--more vegetables as side dishes would be wonderful. Hope to see you again soon.

But, if your bar for pizza is Di Fara, Joe &amp; Pat&#039;s, Mario&#039;s (in Belmont the Bronx), or the other 2 or 3 places that are extremely high quality, you will be constantly disappointed. Likewise, the bar for pizza in this neighborhood is low so almost anything is an improvement. Sac&#039;s (I know you don&#039;t like them) and Louie&#039;s fill the void by being substantially above average for the neighborhood. We can use a third place that is at least willing to try.<br /><br />Secondly, and I&#039;ll probably take some heat for this, there is not a &quot;plethora&quot; of good ethnic foods here. There are one or two (three tops) places for each cuisine that are really good and the rest are sub-par, if not terrible, by almost every metric. We do have some excellent food carts that are often better than most of the restaurants around here.<br /><br />Thirdly, to attack a new place, that has only been open for a couple of weeks, without mentioning anything specific doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense. Was your experience so universally bad that you simply can&#039;t give specifics. I&#039;d be surprised if this were the case.

I don’t think it should detract from other perspectives though. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I was also disappointed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there twice.&nbsp; The wait staff seemed to lack experience based on the little things, e.g., waitress took my drink order and forgot about it until I reminded her like 15/20 minutes later, waiter asked one person at the table for drink order and that person declined and the waiter did not ask others for their drink orders, nobody asks if everything is ok after serving food, etc.<br /><br />Moreover, I ordered the steak and they sent two medium sized steaks that were significantly undercooked - I asked for them to be cooked medium.&nbsp; I sent them back and when they returned the food, one of the steaks was medium and the other was so burnt it was not edible.&nbsp; I mentioned it to the waiter and he saw exactly what happened.&nbsp; I still paid full price for the really poorly cooked steak.&nbsp; On another occasion, I had the burger and found it to be bland - almost as though there was no seasoning and even this was undercooked - I asked for medium.<br /><br />My advise to the owners is to hire a chef that knows how to cook.&nbsp; My guess is that the cook is not a trained cook.&nbsp; The cook is probably a dishwasher who hustled his way to a cooking position.&nbsp; As an aside, the pizza is mediocre.&nbsp; <br /><br />The best part of the restaurant is the beer selection and the ambiance, but I am afraid that if they do not replace the chef soon, people will stop going there.&nbsp; There are so many options in the neighborhood that serve excellent food and the fact that the chef can&#039;t even cook a steak is a bad harbinger for the restaurant&#039;s future.

				I think it&#039;s well worth remembering that the folks involved in the Queensboro made a big commitment to doing something different in the neighborhood--a thoughtful, inviting, large-scale venue with interesting cocktails and a fresh, ever-changing menu.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been about five times so far and it has always been packed with a diverse cross-section of people seeming to enjoy their time there.&nbsp; The drinks are excellent and the food is good and, I&#039;d say, improving as they work out the kinks of opening a large and busy venue.&nbsp; The service is a work in progress, but friendly and accommodating, which is more than you can say about many places in the city.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just me, but when a place is new I like to give it the benefit of the doubt, and if there&#039;s something not to my liking I prefer to address that with the wait staff at the end of the meal (hoping that the comments make it back to the kitchen), rather than blasting them with a one-star Yelp review or scorching them in public fora.&nbsp; In any case, I&#039;ll be back there in the future, and look forward to their long tenure in the neighborhood.&nbsp;

				Why are people so nasty? &quot;Is this still the soft opening--when is the grand opening?&quot; Why so hostile? Nobody is forcing you to patronize the place. Go someplace else if you think they are doing a lousy job. I think it&#039;s wonderful and very much needed in the neighborhood--though yes, they are still working out the kinks of any new establishment. I also experienced a delay in receiving a drink order--but so what? They were extremely busy, and everyone there is still a new employee. Why is that so hard to understand--and why are several of the commenters so unforgiving of an ambitious new restaurant just getting on its feet?

				Finally tried the Queensboro! I&#039;m so happy to have it as part of the (wonderful) mix of eateries we have in Jackson Heights; it really offers something the neighborhood did not have before (and it has so much!).<br /><br />Enjoyed the cocktails very much (a great drinks menu—can&#039;t wait to try more of them), the shishito peppers (hard to go wrong there), a lovely creative salad, and two pastas—both perfectly cooked and delicious. We were checked on frequently during the meal, waters were kept full, and I was delighted to see such friendly, seamless service at a place that&#039;s so new (and huge). Really liked the warm and neighborhood-y vibe.<br /><br />I look forward to trying their brunch and returning often for dinner, drinks, and happy hour. Wishing the team behind the restaurant lots of luck and continued success.

				Finally made it to Queensboro.&nbsp; Was on vacation in early July, and just caught up on the posts on this restaurant.&nbsp; Was surprised at some of the negative posts here...&nbsp; My experience was very good--I really liked the setting and overall casual vibe of the restaurant.&nbsp; Service was very good.&nbsp; I enjoyed the food, having the arugala salad with fresh, quality ingredients, the pasta dish with Shrimp, and the hamburger.&nbsp; All was delicious...(pasta could have been a little more al dente for me).&nbsp; With a glass of wine, my bill was a little more than a typical night out in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I often go to ethnic eats in the neighborhood and I am often disappointed with the quality.&nbsp; A similar pasta dish in a Colombian/Uruguayan restaurant is priced higher than the Queensboro.&nbsp; Overall, I think this is one of the best for quality and value in the neighborhood and also look forward to trying out the brunch.&nbsp;

				I too am surprised by some of the negative reviews here. Of course everyone&#039;s entitled to their opinion, but my experience at the QB was great! The service was prompt and attentive (no late or forgotten drinks) - silverware was changed for each course, which always impresses me. Cocktails were inventive and tasty. The food was great too; we got the chaat popcorn (which was the only miss for me - not a ton of flavor and hard to eat [fork or fingers?]), watercress salad (PHENOMENAL, very fresh, surprising flavors), marg pizza (delicious, I don&#039;t know what everyone&#039;s complaining about), burger (average - not the best we&#039;ve ever had, but certainly not bad), and a fruit cobbler special. Can&#039;t wait to try out the other menu items and will definitely be back for brunch, too. I live a block away... this could get dangerous!<br /><br />Congrats to Dudley and his team on a job well done!

				Hi friends! I haven&#039;t updated on here in a long time, sorry about that. I wanted to give everyone here a heads up about some things that have been happening...<br /><br />First of all, we started featuring live music! My pal, the excellent Jonny Meyers played a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty sweet. His music is phenomenal, and everyone had fun. If you want to hear his stuff, www.jonnymeyersmusic.com will hook you up.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/L7nhwrc.jpg)<br /><br />That&#039;s Jonny and his crew right there.<br /><br />It was so much fun that we&#039;re repeating it this Friday at 10PM with the John Yao Trio! John is another Jackson Heights-er and he will be playing some sweet jazz and other music on his trombone with his band and it should be lots of fun. You should check out www.johnyao.com to hear his music and learn about him. <br /><br />Of course if you were on our mailing list you&#039;d know all of this, if you&#039;re not on it you should get on it! You can enter your email address right there on www.thequeensboro.com<br /><br />As a bonus we&#039;ll offer anyone who signs up on our email list happy hour drinks every Monday to Thursday from 5-7PM! I&#039;m sort of kidding because if you <em>were </em>on our mailing list you&#039;d know that we already have a happy hour - see how useful if would be to have known that?!<br /><br />Hopefully see you all soon at The Q!

				I finally got a chance to come here over the weekend. <br /><br />The service was fantastic. I loved the cocktail I ordered; it was perfect. Very nice space and atmosphere. <br /><br />My only disappointment is just a very minor quibble. The menu online is not exactly the same as inside the restaurant. I have a pretty restricted diet and was happy to find there was a plain&nbsp; steak available, but when I got there it wasn&#039;t on the menu. There was a steak salad but I can&#039;t eat greens. I ordered the pizza because it was the only other thing I could sort of eat. It was very good, but pizza is a once-a-year thing for me and I really didn&#039;t want to order it because I had my &quot;annual pizza&quot; a few days before. I&#039;m not upset that there weren&#039;t a lot of things I could eat - I was just a bit disappointed that the menu was different than the one online. It definitely won&#039;t keep me from returning!

				Aaaaaand for those of you not on our email list, here&#039;s an update about this weekend&#039;s plans for us. We hope you&#039;ll come over at some point!<br /><br />***<br /><br />Dear friends, for those of you who will be around over the Labor Day weekend we&#039;re delighted to announce that we will be open and we will be serving a special menu in addition to our regular delicious food! <br /><br />From Friday to Monday we&#039;ll be offering ribs, chicken wings, corn, and more during our regular dinner service, and on Monday this special menu will be available all day starting at 10AM. As an added bonus we&#039;ll also be open for brunch on Monday as well as our regular brunch service on Saturday and Sunday! <br /><br />We didn&#039;t stop there though, we&#039;re also excited to announce the first annual Queensboro Labor Day Games! Although we have no lawn, or deck, we thought we could make the most of what we do have and make it as fun as possible. So please come hang out with us behind the restaurant on Monday. There will be games, and refreshments, and food, and wading pools, and if you bring a chair there will also be chairs!<br /><br />See you at the Q!

				Hi! I wanted to give a heads up or two about some stuff that&#039;s been going on at The Q.<br /><br />Tomorrow we have music during brunch! We&#039;re mixing things up a little, trying out different days and times and bands, eventually we&#039;ll probably settle on a fairly regular schedule for certain bands on certain days. Or not, we&#039;ll see. But for now, tomorrow, we&#039;re excited to feature the sweet sounds of Nelson Reyes playing some old Cuban classics on his piano, starting around 12! It should be pretty swell. <br /><br />Also, we&#039;re showing Monday Night Football now, on Mondays (funnily enough!) and also some Champion&#039;s League Soccer when the matches seem interesting, we&#039;ll keep you posted on which ones we decide to feature.<br /><br />See you guys around!

				the back and forth over this whole debate begs the question. would the Queensboro, in its current state, with its current menu, even get a bit of notice if it opened on Smith Street or Columbus Avenue? <br /><br />This is in no way a slap at the restaurant, its food, its service, its essence, all perfectly good. just wondering if the novelty of having a more typical &quot;new American&quot; style place is its main calling card here.

				&quot;new American&quot; is the descriptor used on Yelp, Google and every other restaurant rating guide. it&#039;s used for restaurants in Beverly Hills, Scarsdale and the Lower East Side.<br /><br />i&#039;m simply asking if the denizens of this board think the Queensboro would get as much notice if it opened in an area where it&#039;s not a unicorn of sorts.<br /><br />again, not suggesting there&#039;s anything sub-standard about it. but if a new Thai place on the level of Ayada opened in Ditmas Park or Inwood, people would be doing backflips. here, people would say &#039;another Thai place, whoopee.&#039;

				Stopped by last night to check out the music. Cool Jazz from the 50s smartly played, very enjoyable. Had a Supreme pizza, very tasty, thin crust, slightly blackened the way it&#039;s supposed to be. Service was not great, maybe the volume of the music caused communication problems.&nbsp; The hostesses were charming and sat us right away. Nice crowd, featuring a cross section of the neighborhood, saw several longtime residents enjoying the vibe. Definitely a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

				<strong>Lots of upcoming events</strong><br /><br /><br />Hello, this will be a long one since we have much to tell you!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Closed on Thanksgiving Day</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />A lot of people have been asking us about our Thanksgiving plans. We decided that we would not open on Thanksgiving day, it&#039;s a day for families so we want our staff (and ourselves) to spend it connecting with loved ones.<br />&nbsp;<br />(And perhaps a strange cousin or two.)<br />&nbsp;<br />We will, however, be back on Black Friday and serving lunch at 12PM.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>But we will gladly help you with your Thanksgiving day!</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />We&#039;re super excited to announce that you will soon be able to bring The Q into your home! We are currently gearing up to offer delivery (more on this soon!) but for now we&#039;re excited to announce that we can prepare food for <em>your </em>Thanksgiving dinner.<br />&nbsp;<br />You can choose from picking a dish or two that will complement what you are cooking, to ordering an entire turkey dinner with many choices of sides and sauces and stuffing and desserts!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Browse our Thanksgiving menu (https://www.thequeensboro.com/menus)</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Call us at 929-296-0038 or email us (info@thequeensboro.com) or come in and talk to us to place your order!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Party room</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Planning a private event? Want to have a group dinner? Kids birthday party coming up? We have you covered with our party room, where you will be able to host a wide range of events. It will be ready in a couple of weeks, so if you&#039;d like to book it, send an email to events@thequeensboro.com and we can talk about what you&#039;re planning.<br /><br /><strong>Work @ The Q during the day!</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Not &quot;for&quot;, we already have an amazing family of workers so we&#039;re not looking for anyone new right now. What we meant was that you can join the ranks of those who have been using the restaurant during our off hours to get some work done in a peaceful, spacious environment. Call us, email us, come in and talk to us, we&#039;ll fill you in on the details.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Greenmarket cooking demo on Sunday Nov. 18th</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />If you swing by the (amazing) Jackson Heights Greenmarket this coming Sunday at 12PM, Chef Tony will be hosting a cooking demo, with food you can buy from the market right then and there! Learn from the best, then impress your friends!<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>The Prodigals come to Jackson Heights!</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />This week we&#039;re thrilled to have The Prodigals perform on Thursday at 8PM! Not only have they been our friends for many many years, but they&#039;re pretty awesome in their own right!<br />&nbsp;<br />They&#039;ve been described as &quot;What the Ramones might have sounded like if they’d taken traditional Irish music as their starting point&quot;.<br />&nbsp;<br />They will play until 10PM or so, make your reservation now!<br /><br />And after Thanksgiving, we&#039;re delighted that Karina Colis, a drummer &amp; vocalist from Mexico will be playing boleros, cumbia, joropo and much more along with Eric Kurimski on guitar and Roman Rojas on guitar and vocals on Thursday the 29th at 8PM!<br /><br /><strong>New Opening Hours!</strong><br />On Fridays we will be opening at 2:30PM, for drinks and pizza.<br />&nbsp;<br />We are proud to offer happy hour drinks to all Department of Education employees from 2:30PM-7PM.<br /><br />See you at the Q!<br />80-02 Northern Boulevard, Jackson Heights, NY<br />929 296-0038

				Great article about the Queensboro in Edible Queens!<br />http://ediblequeens.ediblecommunities.com/eat/new-american-restaurant-brunch-jackson-heights-queens<br /><br />(http://ediblequeens.ediblecommunities.com/sites/default/files/styles/ariticle_feartured_image_landscape/public/images/article/Queensboro-brunch-restaurant-jackson-heights-queens-2.JPG?itok=Ph5XcDup)<br /><br /><strong>Seasonal American Fare with a Queens Twist Comes to Jackson Heights</strong><br />BY J. A. STRUB | DECEMBER 31, 2018<br /><br />For years, a humble triumvirate of Jackson Heights residents dreamed of opening a bistro. In 2015, they embarked on a long and winding road that eventually lead to the Queensboro, a new restaurant on Northern Boulevard that puts a local twist on the popular New American format.<br /><br />“Everybody talks about the nightmarish process of opening a restaurant in New York, but we had no idea it would be this intense,” recalls cofounder Dudley Stewart. “Conflicts over permitting, issues with contractors, losing money every day. We put our house on the line, used pretty much everything we owned as collateral.”<br /><br />“Our goal was to open the kind of place that the three of us have always wanted in the neighborhood,” says fellow co-founder Michael Fuquay. “There are so many fantastic food options in Jackson Heights, so we wanted to add something new and needed. To emphasize fresh and local ingredients, a convivial atmosphere, and an elevated beverage program – that was always our aim.”<br /><br />When searching for an executive chef, Stewart and Fuquay brought on their neighbor Tony Liu as a third partner. Instilled with a love of seafood and pan-Pacific flavors from his childhood in Hawaii, Liu has directed kitchens in some of Manhattan’s most acclaimed destination restaurants. After cutting his teeth at famed French restaurants Lespinasse (now shuttered) and Daniel, Liu has since worked at Mario Batali’s Babbo and the late, storied pizzeria Pulino’s.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Queensboro opened the first week of June. The restaurant is spacious yet comfortable, with an all-wood interior and a long, inviting bar. One’s eyes are naturally drawn to the open kitchen and its centerpiece: a massive brick pizza oven.<br /><br />“We bought this used from a guy in Pennsylvania,” says Stewart. “We’ve gotten it to an internal temperature of close to 900 degrees. It’s the real deal.”<br /><br />Click link above for full article

				Dear friends, it almost doesn&#039;t need to be said, but The Queensboro loves you. To prove it we’d like to introduce our newest programming idea:<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Brunch without Baby!</strong><br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f442f63239b2409ca3545498d44b9117.jpg/v1/fill/w_638,h_425,al_c,lg_1/crop/x_0,y_0,w_638,h_425/image.jpg)<br /><br />How’s that you say?!<br />&nbsp;<br />Starting in just over a week, on Saturday mornings at 10am, The Queensboro will be offering entertaining classes for your kids in our downstairs Party Room.<br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile parents (you!) will remain upstairs luxuriating in your brunch-time bliss: Eggs Benedict, Mimosas, Smoked Fish on Rye, all accompanied by the dulcet tones of adult conversation. Catch up with your significant other, plan your week, or just sit in pleasantly stunned silence, all without worrying about “Little Reach and Grab It” launching the maple syrup into the laps of the people on the next table.<br />&nbsp;<strong><br />Sign me up! How does it work?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Simply book your brunch reservation for 10 am on Saturday morning and let us know you are also signing up one or more of your offspring for that day’s class. Each week may have a different price, age range and class size, so check to make sure you have the right class for your child. The price of the class will added to your brunch check. Did we mention that we will also be feeding your child?<br />&nbsp;<br />Raising children is hard and we could all use some help. This is our drop in the bucket of making your day a little easier, a little more tranquil, a little more... Queensboro.<br />&nbsp;<strong><br />March schedule of classes</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday, March 9<br /><em>(Ages 3 and up)</em><br />Waffles &amp; Watercolors<br />10am to 11:30am<br />&nbsp;<br />Parents and families enjoy Saturday brunch while the kids mix paints and learn the basics of water coloring from local Queens based artist, Donna Levinstone.<br />&nbsp;<br />As a child, Donna knew she wanted to be an artist and she is dedicated to nurturing your child&#039;s creativity and self expression in this special Spring Fantasy themed workshop in our Activity Center Downstairs at The Queensboro.<br />&nbsp;<br />$25 activity fee includes a beverage and waffles for the kids. Art supplies included.<br />&nbsp;<br />March 16<br />Cookie Decorating for St Patrick&#039;s Day<br />&nbsp;<br />March 23<br />Magic in the Mornings with Joe the Magic Man<br />&nbsp;<br />March 30<br />Sing-a-Long Saturdays with Andy and Suzanna<br />&nbsp;<br />Make a reservation now at www.thequeensboro.com<br />

				Hello! See further below for information on this week&#039;s &quot;Brunch Without Kids&quot; event on Saturday, but first let&#039;s talk a little about how thrilled we are for Thursday&#039;s music!<br /><br />One of the great things about being a restaurant in a neighborhood like ours is the amount and variety of talent that we can use for our music nights. There are so many wonderful musicians who live in or around Jackson Heights, and it&#039;s truly a pleasure to be able to offer them one more venue where they can share their talents.<br /><br />On that note, this Thursday at 8:30 please stop by to hear Wendy Wills and Chris Lovasz perform as Wills &amp; Lovasz! Wendy has a long career as a musician and singer and she&#039;s a dear friend of us at The Queensboro so we&#039;re really looking forward to this one!<br /><br />They&#039;ll be playing rock, blues, jazz, pop and originals, and it might be good to book a table for this event!<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_88594951a8f74cdd8b914b4e869f235d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.jpg)<br /><br /><strong>Brunch Without Kids, Singalong and Storytime - Saturday 10AM!</strong><br /><br />If you book a table for Saturday at 10AM you&#039;ll be able to enjoy a kid-free brunch while your kids rock out with Suzanna and her guitar, shakers, scarves, puppets, and hands on instruments. This interactive concert will get everyone dancing and singing along to old favorites, kid friendly pop music, and fun originals.<br /><br />Learn more about Suzanna (and husband &#039;Mr Andy&#039;) at AndyandSuzanna.com<br /><br />Let us know in your reservation notes if you want to book any kids for this, at $20/child.

We are going to show the match at 3PM and offer wings and pizza specials and birthday cake afterwards. <br /><br /><em>We love you all, and we would love it if you came to celebrate with us on one or more of those days!</em><br /><br />Looking ahead:<br /><br /><strong>Queens Pride</strong> - on June 2nd celebrate pride day with us after the parade! Council Member Danny Dromm was one of the founders of the parade, he is doing wonderful work representing us in City Hall, and we are happy to join in the festivities!<br /><br /><strong>Women&#039;s World Cup</strong> - this will take place between June 7th and July 7th, and we will certainly be showing some of the matches here at The Q.<br /><br /><strong>Copa America </strong>- the Copa America begins on the 14th of June and runs until July 7th. We&#039;ll be showing some of the matches, so maybe now is the time to buy your Colombia jersey so you won&#039;t feel left out!<br />

				<div><strong>TONIGHT!</strong></div><strong><br />Helen Quinn Art Exhibit Opening - Thursday June 6th, 6-8PM </strong><br /><br />You may have noticed that we&#039;ve been changing the art that was hanging on our walls for this past year. The large photographs were by Greg Kessler, a local photographer who very kindly lent us his pieces to decorate our space. He has a great eye for interesting characters and his beautiful photos really added a nice touch to The Q. <br /><br />This is a guy who has photographed President Obama, presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, and a guy walking down Roosevelt Avenue with a large constrictor snake wrapped around his shoulders, so he&#039;s pretty cool, and if you want to find out more about him head on over to his website. <br /><br />This week we&#039;re excited to finish installing art from another local artist, Helen Quinn! She is a stylist, designer, and artist living in New York City.<br /><br />Join us on Thursday from 6-8PM to meet her and take a look at her amazing pieces that we&#039;ve installed all over the restaurant. <br /><em><br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_b9542e14db9041979a0e7c134078c873~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png)<br /><br />A little more about Helen:</em> <br /><br />She has been an editor and prop stylist for television, magazines, and catalogs. Her experience with color, texture, and interiors has led her to design textiles as well as paint lines.<br /><br />She has led workshops at Parsons/The New School for the Aftertaste series and for Michelle Obama&#039;s &quot;Reach Higher&quot; initiative at the White House in 2014.<br /><br />Each Spring she looks forward to teaching Color Lab at Parsons. Recently, she has been collaborating with artist Ondine Crispin, making prints for Dovecote Collective.<br /><br /><strong>Check out her website over here!

				<strong>$10 Pizza Today For Mets Fans!</strong><br /><br />Come Watch the All Star Game with us at 7:30!<br /><br />Mets fans rejoice! After Pete Alonso&#039;s win yesterday in the Home Rub Derby he&#039;ll be fired up to play alongside his colleagues Jacob DeGrom and Jeff McNeil tonight at 7:30, and we are so fired up about this that we&#039;re going to be offering $10 pizzas all night to anyone wearing their Mets gear, so come by and say hi to us tonight!<br />&nbsp;<br />You could also make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-07-09&amp;seats=2) to make sure you get a good seat. <br /><br /><strong>Wino Wednesday Continues!</strong><br /><br />Everyone loves a cool glass of white or rosé on a summer day, but have you thought about switching it up with a chilled summer red wine?&nbsp; Cooler temperatures accentuate the wine’s natural fruit profile while tamping down the alcohol.&nbsp; It&#039;s perfect with pizza or grilled meats or just to quaff with some small nibbles, all while keeping your cool. <br />&nbsp;<br />We’re pouring a lovely Dolcetto with a nice chill this summer at The Queensboro and on Wino Wednesday this week, we’ll be offering it will a cool price tag as well - $6 a glass all night long. Its a chance to try something new and maybe put a different tint on your summer wine drinking.<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/799dfeebbb2d4f87ad31e6c6ac03b9ca.jpg/v1/fill/w_740,h_493,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/799dfeebbb2d4f87ad31e6c6ac03b9ca.webp)<br />&nbsp;<br />Cheers!<br /><br /><strong>Jazz on Thursday and Sunday!</strong><br /><br />We are looking forward to more excellent jazz this week with two big events!<br />&nbsp;<br />First, consider joining us on Thursday at 8PM to check out the Jon Menges Trio bring it with some fantastic jazz tunes for a couple of sets. We&#039;re delighted to have them play with us again.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then, on Sunday, we will close out the Jackson Heights Jazz Festival with a performance by The Ed Fuqua Trio at 8PM! We could say that it&#039;s worth coming for this just to see Ed&#039;s gorgeous custom bass but that wouldn&#039;t do justice to the talent that he brings to the table.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is some of the finest jazz around folks, we highly recommend going to the Vanessa Rubin Travers Park concert at 6PM for a taste of some outdoors music before coming to The Q to finish the festival off with a bang. You won&#039;t be disappointed, but if you don&#039;t make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-07-14&amp;seats=2) you might, so why not go ahead and do that now?

We’re always excited when cool new neighbors move in, so we were really thrilled when Steffen Kenney opened Stand Alone Cheese (https://www.standalonecheese.com/) in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />This gem of a store not only sells some amazing cheeses, but also has bread (some of it from the baked-at-the-Q Little Wildbranch Bakery), charcuterie, ice cream, exotic canned goods, a friendly approachable attitude and much more!<br /><br />We want you to meet these guys, so we’re hosting a Stand Alone Cheese Night here at The Queensboro.<br /><br />On Tuesday, September 24th at 8:30pm, Steffen will lead a curated tasting of fine cheeses from his shop, each paired with some of our fresh, delicious beers. Five cheeses, five beers and lots of wisdom, all for $25 per person.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seating will be limited so we strongly recommend booking in advance (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-24&amp;seats=2).<br /><br />Leave us a note saying &quot;CHEESE!&quot; in the reservation so we know you&#039;re booking a space for this event.<br /><br />If you can’t make the tasting, fear not! We’ll be offering a Stand Alone Cheese plate the rest of the week (or until it sells out).&nbsp; What’s more all of the cheeses from the tasting are available for purchase at Stand Alone Cheese, 79-07 37th Avenue.<br /><br /><strong>A little more about Steffen:</strong><br /><br />Steffen&#039;s journey into the world of cheese began 20 years ago, as a student in Philadelphia. A part-time job at Downtown Cheese in the Reading Terminal Market turned into a full-time passion. Steffen was drawn to the diversity of cheeses from around the world and the stories behind them. He enjoyed how discussions about cheese often transformed into conversations about life.<br /><br />After moving to New York, Steffen work at local institutions Ideal Cheese and Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro. He also guided food and beer tours throughout the city. Steffen dreamed of opening a shop in Queens to provide quality cheese and specialty products to an underserved part of the city.<br /><br />When his friends at Table Wine (https://tablewine-ny.com/)&nbsp; encouraged him to check out 37th Avenue, Steffen knew that he had found just the place: an amazing community hungry for cheese, and on June 1, 2019, he opened Stand Alone Cheese in Jackson Heights.[/size]

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Dear friends and neighbors, we have so many things happening at The Queensboro, we&#039;re bursting with excitement!<br /><br />First of all, we hope that everyone is enjoying Annabelle Popa&#039;s gorgeous art that is on the walls of the restaurant. Our eternal gratitude to Helen Quinn (http://www.helenquinnnyc.com/) for allowing us to feature her work for so long. If you&#039;re interested in purchasing any of Annabelle&#039;s work, or one of her prints check out her website (https://www.annabellepopa.com/) and see what strikes your fancy!<br /><br />Our Beer &amp; Cheese tasting with Stand Alone Cheese (https://www.standalonecheese.com/) is taking place tomorrow, and - as careful readers of our messages will know - it is sold out! This encouraged us to add another night of Beer &amp; Cheese on the following Tuesday!<br /><br />So join us on Tuesday October 1st at 8:30PM to check out 5 beers and 5 cheeses with Steffen from Stand Alone Cheese. When you make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-01&amp;seats=2), be sure to say &quot;CHEESE&quot; in the notes to let us know you&#039;re booking for this event!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Ed Fuqua &amp; Jim Hershman Perform on Thursday</strong></span><br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_13b2f42ae65c481da14b411049d449be~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png)<br /><br />We&#039;ve said it before and it bears repeating - when Ed and Jim play together, musical sparks fly! These guys are some of the best around, we consider ourselves to be lucky that they play at The Q, if you haven&#039;t heard them before you really owe it to yourself to come and check them out.<br /><br />Sadly, Ed is leaving us for a land that isn&#039;t accessible by subway (somewhere in the blurry expanses west of the Hudson) and this might be his final performance at The Q! We hope to sneak in one more show but we can&#039;t make any promises so please come by and say hi and hear him and Jim play, it truly is some of the most beautiful music around.<br /><br />Reward yourself and make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-09-26&amp;seats=2).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Oktoberfest!</strong></span><br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_034d83cdf102425da844142704597208~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.jpg)<br /><br />Everybody knows that Oktoberfest starts in September (actually we had no idea!), so last weekend we were more than ready to start serving liter steins of a gorgeous Oktoberfest beer from Jack&#039;s Abbey, and some of the most delicious bratwurst in pretzel bread with sauerkraut, double mustard, and Swiss cheese we&#039;ve ever tasted! Oktoberfest continues for another 2 weeks or so, which gives you plenty of time to swing by and enjoy some proper German delights! The mug in the above photograph is about a foot tall, which gives you an idea of the size of the dish next to it. Not insubstantial!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Irishfest!</strong></span><br /><br />Do you remember Saint Patrick&#039;s day weekend? We often don&#039;t, but this year we do because we were lucky enough to have The Prodigals (https://www.prodigals.com/) perform at The Q, and they were so much fun we&#039;re excited to welcome them back this coming weekend!<br /><br />On Saturday at 3:30PM get ready to rock out to some awesome Irish music at The Queensboro. They&#039;ve been described as &quot;What the Ramones might have sounded like if they’d taken traditional Irish music as their starting point&quot; - which sounds pretty cool to us!</span></span><br /><br />See you at The Q!

They played for Saint Patrick&#039;s Day this year and they were a lot of fun, everyone loved them and we&#039;ve had a lot of requests to get them to come back, so we jumped at the chance to book them again.<br /><br />This Saturday get ready to rock out to some awesome Irish music at The Queensboro. It&#039;s very family-friendly so feel free to bring your kids and hang out in the afternoon, we&#039;ll be serving food at 4 and the drinks will certainly be flowing!<br /><br />They&#039;ve been described as &quot;What the Ramones might have sounded like if they’d taken traditional Irish music as their starting point&quot;, which is very high praise in this neck of the woods!

We&#039;re partnering with Shenanigans NY for a weekly Board Gaming session at The Queensboro, starting tomorrow, Wednesday the 16th of October at 6:30. <br /><br />We&#039;re turning the restaurant into a board gamer&#039;s paradise!

				<strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Board Gaming Tomorrow!</span></strong><br /><br />Hello friends! And hello board gaming fans! We&#039;re delighted to team up with Shenanigans NY tomorrow to bring our weekly board gaming night to The Queensboro!<br /><br />Every Wednesday, at 6:30 we&#039;re turning the restaurant into a board gamer&#039;s paradise! About 50 games will be available to play - from the classics, to some of the newest games just released from the best designers on Kickstarter. This is a very family-friendly event, but we&#039;ve also had people show up alone, or as a couple, and they had a great time.<br /><br />The awesome folks at Shenanigans will be there to guide you through the rules of any game you might be unfamiliar with, or to match you up with potential partners. There will be discounts and raffles and it&#039;s a fantastic opportunity to make some new friends, bond with some old ones, or simply bring the whole family and enjoy an evening of gaming and good food.<br /><br />You can register for this event right here (https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-2)! <br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Thursday, 8:30 - George Papageorge and friends!</span></strong><br /><br />George Papageorge is one of the finest blues and jazz keyboard players, he lives right here in Jackson Heights and we&#039;re lucky enough to have him and his pals play at The Q from time to time. It&#039;s a wonderful show, the music is great and we love having them play here.<br /><br />If you&#039;re free, swing by for a drink, or if you also want to have a meal, then if you make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-24&amp;seats=2) it would be just swell!<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Sunday - Pau Hana at The Queensboro</span></strong><br /><br />This coming Sunday our Sunday Supper will be slightly different. Join Halawai (http://www.halawai.org) for some kanikapila, ʻono food and a fun time at The Queensboro. There will be music, dancing and lots of that loving, unique Hawaiian vibe! We&#039;ll feature a special menu with Hawaiian offerings by Chef Tony.<br /><br />It will take place from 5-7PM, but if you can&#039;t make it that early, don&#039;t worry - we&#039;ll make sure to keep the delicious food available all night!<br /><br />You can - and should - reserve for this event right here (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-10-27&amp;seats=2)!<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_c46b85e16b19461c8b0f29694fb49d89~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png)

Starting at 5PM, for a low price you will be able to feed 2-3 adults, or a family of 4 or 5 people.<br /><br />This week our delicious menu will feature a pimento cheese dip, crackers and crudités as a first course, followed by a fragrant, savory, sweet, spiced chicken stew, all for $45!<br /><br />If you want to not worry about cooking on Sunday evening, please make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-11-03&amp;seats=2), and we look forward to seeing you at The Q!<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_d07306a7f5cd4f0d868011b3e5599df4~mv2.gif)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Upcoming Events</strong></span><br /><br /><strong>Today is Halloween!</strong> We love Halloween, who doesn&#039;t love Halloween?! Tonight if you come in costume you will be able to drink at Happy Hour prices all night.<br /><br />In addition, our team of amazing, unbiased judges will be awarding prizes to the best costumes! If you come in costume to dine or have a drink, simply have your picture taken at our spooky corner, and at 9PM our expert panel of seasoned professionals will decide the best kids costume and the best adult costume!<br /><br /><strong>NEXT THURSDAY IS ED FUQUA DAY!</strong><br /><br />Starting at around 8:30PM, come listen to some of the finest jazz around as Ed joins us with a trio! These guys are true artists, their music is a joy to listen to and we consider ourselves lucky that they are able to play at The Q.<br /><br />On a sadder note, this is Ed&#039;s last gig with us. He is moving away. Why would anybody move away from NYC? We don&#039;t understand that, but we secretly hope he has a difficult time not being close to any subways, and he moves back before we know it!<br /><br /><strong>SOLAR HAPPY HOUR: THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14th, 6:30-8:30</strong><br /><br />Come to the Jackson Heights Goes Solar happy hour. Chat with neighbors who have already installed solar panels, enjoy drink specials, and learn how to make JH even greener!<br /><br />Hosted by The Queens Climate Project.<br /><br /><strong>NOVEMBER 23rd - DRAG SHOW!</strong><br /><br />Time for something completely different on Saturday the 23rd! Starting at 10PM we are super excited to be host a drag show featuring Ducky Sheaboi and Patsy Indecline, plus a special guest!<br /><br />More details to come soon, but make sure you mark your calendars for this one folks, and maybe make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-11-23&amp;seats=2)? It&#039;s going to be (sorry) dragtastic!

				<strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Upcoming Events!</span></strong><br /><br /><strong>So many things happening at The Q!</strong><br /><br />Dear friends and neighbors, this is a busy week for us as we gear up towards the holiday season. We have lots of events planned for you as we work hard to make The Queensboro a fun, comfortable, and warm destination for you!<br /><br />Let&#039;s quickly break it down, and details on each events will be further down:<br /><br />Today, Wednesday: Board Gaming night - fun for everyone, come alone, come with a partner or bring the kids, you&#039;ll have a great time trying out new games brought to you by the wonderful folks at ShenanigansNY (https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-4)!<br /><br />Tomorrow, Thursday, we&#039;re looking forward to two events that we think will work well together.<br /><br />First, join your neighbors from the Jackson Heights Climate Committee for a Solar Happy Hour from 6:30-8:30, and then at 8:30 Vinny and the Unknowns will perform once again, bringing us some great blues, rock and classics.<br /><br />On Friday the Cold Club of Queens will perform around 9PM, so get ready for some beautiful Django-jazz inspired tunes!<br /><br />We are open for Thanksgiving! Our menus for in-house dining and catering are now online over here (https://www.thequeensboro.com/thanksgiving).<br /><br />Sunday will be another Sunday Supper day, we&#039;ll get you details about that day&#039;s dish very soon but if you want to ensure you get some (whatever it is you know it will be good) you really should make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2019-11-17&amp;seats=2),and let us know that you want some of that Sunday Supper!<br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Wednesday</strong></span><br /><br />So you&#039;re interested in board gaming? Maybe your kids are? Or you want to meet new people, maybe make some friends? Shenanigans NY have partnered with us for several weeks now, and it has been a blast.<br /><br />They bring a whole pile of really cool games, ranging from some of the classics to new ones that have just been released, and they&#039;ll show you how to play them, pair you with other players and generally just make sure that you have a good time.<br /><br />It&#039;s happening every Wednesday from 6:30 to 10:30, and you can just show up and pay $5 to join in, or you can buy a ticket beforehand, and get discounts on your check, and you&#039;ll also be entered into a raffle for some cool prizes.<br /><br />Click on the picture below to get your tickets and get ready to have some fun!<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_38b6009b3e3c480b93ce5500172004bb~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png) (https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-4)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Thursday</strong></span><br /><br />The very cool people at The Queens Climate Project are working hard to make our neighborhood, and borough, better places to live in, so we&#039;re hosting them - and you! - for a happy hour on Thursday the 14th. Here is what they have to say:<br /><br />-<br /><br />&quot;Hey Jackson Heights! We all know that NYC needs to get to 100% renewable energy fast, and what better community than ours – the most culturally diverse, politically active, all-around awesome neighborhood in the city -- to lead the way?&nbsp; Transforming how we live will take nothing short of a revolution…and hey, revolutions always go down better with drinks in hand! So come talk sustainability at the JACKSON HEIGHTS GOES GREEN Happy Hours series the 2nd Thursday of every month, 6:30-8:30! (Stay on for the live music afterwards.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Hope to see you at our kick-off event, JACKSON HEIGHTS GOES SOLAR, on November 14th. Come chat with neighbors who have already installed solar panels, enjoy drink specials, and learn how to make Jackson Heights even greener!&quot;<br /><br />-<br /><br />And then... at 8:30 we&#039;ll be enjoying the music of Vinny &amp; The Unknowns who will be playing an eclectic mix of pop, jazz, blues, rock covers and originals and more! You might know Vinny as the sound and stage person behind the JHBG Summer Sundays concerts in Travers Park. We&#039;re glad to support another local musician, especially when they are this much fun!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Friday</strong></span><br /><br />The Cold Club of Queens play some fantastically fun music inspired by Django Reinhardt who hit it big in the 1930&#039;s and 40&#039;s with his unique style of jazz. These guys below aren&#039;t that old but they play (probably) just as well and it&#039;s really worth checking them out. It&#039;s always a fun night when they perform, and we are looking forward to it!<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_d0bcfac341e34a3a890cd0a10709415a~mv2_d_2048_1367_s_2.jpg/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.jpg)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Sunday</strong></span><br /><br />Sunday Supper!

Because of the strong interest in the party, last year we had a waitlist, so it will probably be easy to resell your tickets.<br /><br /><strong>Who is the DJ?&nbsp; What type of music will be played?</strong><br />JoeZ, a fantastic and versatile local DJ will be playing music from various decades, we&#039;re lucky to have been able to book him again this year.<br /><br /><strong>What is the closing time?</strong><br />We expect things to wind down sometime after midnight, and sometime before 4AM. <br /><br />

However, it is undeniable - and perhaps even proven by science - that they all pale in comparison to this long, bitter, heart wrenching clash that for generations has torn families apart, destroyed friendships, caused numerous deaths, and is probably responsible for several wars.<br /><br />It&#039;s a beautiful thing, it&#039;s a beautiful game, and next Wednesday when we open our doors at 1:30, we will be serving beer and other great drinks at happy hour prices until 7PM, and $12 pizzas, and we will be showing the game on our big screen.<br /><br />The match is at an awkward time of day for us here in the US, so we suggest that you lay the groundwork early to be able to call in sick on Wednesday. We hope that you will do everything that it takes to watch this match, and we would love it if you were to watch it with us.<br /><br /><strong>El Clasico at The Q - 2PM Wednesday December 18th<br /></strong><br />What else is happening on Wednesday? We mentioned the $12 pizzas which we&#039;ll have available all evening, and it is our board game night as well! Stick around until 6:30 when the fine folks from Shenanigans NY (https://www.shenanigansny.com/events/game-night-at-the-queensboro-8) come by to set up their 50+ board games for you to try!<br />

To that end we&#039;ve implemented several measures:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>We are telling our staff to avoid coming in if they&#039;re feeling sick or if they think they may have come in contact with someone who is.</li><li>We are increasing the frequency and thoroughness of our already stringent cleaning and sanitation practices throughout the restaurant, and are cleaning tables, door handles and other surfaces with a strong anti-viral solution.</li><li>We have increased the space between our dining tables for the comfort of our guests.</li><li>We have set up a hand-sanitizing station at the front entrance for our staff and guests to use.</li></ul><br />Finally, with the new rules concerning restaurant capacity - we are temporarily limited by the city to half of our maximum occupancy - if you&#039;re coming for dinner or brunch, please make a reservation to avoid disappointment!<br /><br />These are uncertain times, but as your neighborhood restaurant we&#039;re here for you. If you are able to, we hope you&#039;ll continue to support your local businesses and look out for your neighbors, especially if they are elderly or otherwise vulnerable and have limited ability to leave their homes.<br /><br /><strong>Delivery</strong><br /><br />Our full menu is available via delivery, we do ask that if you want to order online <strong>please use this link on our website</strong> (https://www.thequeensboro.com/order-online) to reduce the delivery fees that we incur. If you want to pick up your meal yourself, you can call the restaurant directly at 929 296 0038 to place your order, and you will avoid all of those GrubHub fees.<br /><br /><strong>Sunday Suppers</strong><br /><br />This Sunday our Sunday Supper will celebrate Saint Patrick&#039;s Day week with some corned beef and rarebit.<br /><br />We&#039;re also super proud to have booked The Prodigals again for St Paddy&#039;s Day itself at 5PM on the 17th!<br /><br />The week after that we&#039;re featuring some Salmon Wellington, and to finish the month off we&#039;ll be offering pork chops, rice pilaf and braised greens!<br /><br />Make a reservation (https://resy.com/cities/ny/the-queensboro?date=2020-03-15&amp;seats=2) and let us know that you&#039;re coming for the Sunday Supper!

				<span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Queensboro Delivery and Takeout</strong></span><br /><br />Dear friends and neighbors, like all of you, we&#039;ve been closely monitoring the fast-changing recommendations regarding COVID-19 preparedness and safety, and the latest actions by the city.<br /><br />We will be closed on Monday as usual, when we reopen on Tuesday it will be for delivery and pick up only until further notice. In response to suggestions and requests from the community, we will be adding a lunch menu for delivery/pick-up, as well as some additional freezer-friendly meals. We&#039;ll have more information on this as soon as possible.<br /><br />We would like to please request that if you order food to pick up, please call us at 929 296 0038 in order to avoid the GrubHub fees that we would incur. We are exploring other methods of ordering that will make it more affordable for us to provide you with the Queensboro dishes that we are so proud of.<br /><br />As always, thank you for your support of The Queensboro. We look forward to welcoming you back to the restaurant as soon as possible. Until then, please stay safe and take care of yourselves and each other.<br /><br />Dudley, Mike, and Tony<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong>Gift Cards</strong></span><br /><br />We have been asked about our gift cards, and if people could buy some now to help tide us over until we reopen. This is a very thoughtful gesture and we really appreciate hearing it. If you want to do this, our gift cards can be bought online over here (https://www.toasttab.com/the-queensboro/giftcards). Thank you!

				Hello neighbors! I hope you are all staying safe, and healthy. Times are tough and everything is up in the air and we have no idea what is coming down the line, but for now The Queensboro is doing delivery, for brunch today and dinner later, and then lunch/dinner throughout the rest of the week.<br /><br />We will be closed tomorrow - Monday - though, because we need to rest and stock up and prep for the week. <br /><br />So if you want some of our food delivered to you, check our website at www.thequeensboro.com (https://www.thequeensboro.com/) - our menu is on there, you can order directly through the site and in a short while you&#039;ll be munching away on some delicious Queensboro food! You can also come pick it up if you prefer, we&#039;ll leave your food at the entrance of the restaurant so you won&#039;t need to deal with anyone closer than 6 feet.<br /><br />What&#039;s pretty amazing is that you can order beer <strong>and</strong> wine <strong>and</strong> cocktails for delivery, so... get to it Jackson Heights, please order a ton of food from all of the local independent restaurants, they very much need it these days.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Friends, we&#039;re very sad to say that we have made the difficult decision to temporarily close delivery and pickup at The Queensboro, starting today. It is too risky right now to continue to ask our employees to come to work when the rate of infections are rising the way they are.<br /><br />Over the past couple of weeks we have been moved by the incredible outpouring of support from you, our regulars and neighbors and friends. We cannot thank you enough.<br />&nbsp;<br />We don&#039;t know when we will reopen. We will be - like everyone else - obsessively monitoring every scrap of news, and when we see that it won&#039;t be a risk to ask people to come back to work, we will once more start bringing our food and drinks to your homes.<br /><br />And then, eventually, we will actually welcome you into our space.<br /><br />We cannot wait.<br /><br />Until then, thank you Jackson Heights. You are amazing, and we will see you all soon.<br /><br />The Queensboro Team.<br /><br />(https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d39650_3dfc5ccca8824dbf9b126353fcde1baa~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_700,h_2000,al_c,q_85/image.png)<br />

				Hi All, <br /><br />I just wanted to say that, for the 1st time, I ordered the family meal and had it delivered to my home.&nbsp; It was absolutely delicious - amazing - and was delivered as attractively as if it was at the restaurant table.&nbsp; I&#039;m one person but this well do me for 3-4 meals no problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you Queensboro. I even had a bottle of wine delivered with it... but I don&#039;t know if the wine will last for 3-4 meals.&nbsp; Thank you - thank you.

				Thanks, that&#039;s really nice to hear!<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been posting on here but I figure you&#039;re all on our email list already, (or maybe you&#039;re an anonymous troll that hates us and you&#039;re not on the list!) but just to get you guys up to speed we&#039;ve been gently ramping up what we do but in a limited way because we&#039;re being very careful about bringing staff in.<br /><br />First of all we&#039;ve been cooking meals for healthcare workers and it&#039;s all possible because of donations that people have made, which is really very very awesome!<br /><br />We&#039;re also offering a family meal most nights of the week, good for 2-3 adults or a family, check our email list for details.<br /><br />Finally we&#039;re also making &quot;care packages&quot; which are boxes filled with staples such as flour, beans, milk, butter, onions, greens, bacon, bread etc which you can come pick up, we&#039;re going to be doing those on Saturday.<br /><br />Check our website to sign up for our email list - thequeensboro.com<br /><br />We&#039;ll get through this, somehow, I hope, maybe!<br /><br />

				Just discovered that one has to act fast for the Queensboro family meal--by the time we decided we wanted to order one (late morning on Saturday) they were sold out. Hope to make it in time next time!

				try to get on their e-mail list if you&#039;re not already. they send the notification out fairly early (not crack of dawn), but it does sell out pretty quickly. and it is a great deal.
