					I just called Ferrera&#039;s office and the guy there said that as of May that block is in Dromm&#039;s district, so call there. It will be a real shame if this is made into a parking lot. Even though these buildings are rentals that doesn&#039;t mean the landlord should be able to do this.

					I too live within two blocks of Pizza Sam and I am sorry to say I heard from neighbors that they went out of business. Its really too bad because Pizza Sam was an icon in that part of the neighborhood, although it wasn&#039;t really Pizza Sam, it was sold by Sam&#039;s son about two years ago after Sam Sr. passed away. The new owners were not too great with the food, wasn&#039;t so good any more. I am going to take a photo of the roll down gate it has a huge picture of Sam Sr and Sam Jr. on it.<br />

					But, of course, its fine if people spread misinformation about Garden school, right? <br /><br />When the deal with the city goes through, and the neighborhood gets more park space, I would hope that the residents of Jackson Heights would start supporting the Garden school at little, and be nicer to the families there. We do have a part time nursery program that&#039;s competitively priced similar to others in the neighborhood. And of course our summer camp. You can also rent our pool for parties, and our gym. Most of the parents at the school work very hard to send their kids there and sacrifice vacations and other expensive habits. We are not the elite rich we are working class people also.

					&nbsp;8)Yes And........Dude that was 20 years ago. It is now 2011. Why are you doing this? We are nice people at Garden school who are just trying to give their children the best education that can. Please stop spreading the rumor that the school is closing based on your opinion. Please be nice, there are children involved here, innocent children who love their school. You are creating panic for no reason.

					Another parent from Garden School here. I have lived in Jackson Heights all my life, and I am <strong>really upset right now.</strong> The two people in the back were standing at least standing a good distance from the entrance. But the three of you in the front <strong>were standing directly in front of the entrance. We asked you nicely to move a bit on the side and you would not budge. </strong> <strong>I CALL THAT HARASSMENT. </strong>&nbsp; One of the men were very tall and wearing a hat and sunglasses, very intimidating.&nbsp; The children were all asking questions and some of them were crying. PLEASE DO NOT COME BACK TO THE SCHOOL.<br /><br />There was no reason whatsoever for you guys to be in front of Garden school this morning. The administration has been emailing parents about the field. The so called &quot;parents&quot; who claim they didn&#039;t hear about it are lying, or maybe they are not parents at all. The administration has been telling us from before the summer that they were planning to sell the field.

					I would be interested, especially if its on the weekend, I work full time. If possible early but not too early. Garden school rents various rooms at a very modest rate. They have a gym, but that may be too big. But they also have a music/dance room. My son goes to school there if you want I could find out how much they charge.

					Right you are Taggie, why don&#039;t we look at other open space in the neighborhood. Like the Queens Savings bank on Northern and 77th street, they have an awfully big parking lot. And also, I realized I never see more than a few cars in that parking lot. It&#039;s like wasted space. Why can they sell that land real cheap to the Parks Dept so the neighborhood can use it as green space. It&#039;s right across the street from Travers park. We can put some benches there and there some extra space for the community. Better yet they can donate the space. And what about all those beautiful gardens in the landmarked coop buildings why don&#039;t they open those of for community use. Why should Garden school be the only one being harrassed.

					I am trying to make a point. Everyone is pushing Garden school to sell their yard only for neighborhood green space. But what about over businesses. The neighborhood people has given Queens County plenty of business throughout the years, the least they can do is turn part of their parking lot into a park, put a few benches, some grass, etc. That parking lot is never, ever full, they don&#039;t need the space.

					I just realized something this morning as I pulled into the parking lot at the Queens Savings bank on Northern and 77th street, they have an awfully big parking lot. And also, I realized I never see more than a few cars in that parking lot. It&#039;s like wasted space. Why can they sell that land real cheap to the Parks Dept so the neighborhood can use it as green space. It&#039;s right across the street from Travers park. Better yet they can donate the space.
