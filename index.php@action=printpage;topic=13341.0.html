				Hi all, would anyone be able to recommend someone I could consult with to help me decide on a paint colour (possibly more than one) to repaint an entire apartment in JH? The different shades of white, off-white, ivory, cream, eggshell, beige, ecru, and taupe alone are giving me migraines.

				We went to the UES with this guy in benjamin moore&#039;s store and he was AMAZING - and free (obviously he only recommend benjamin moore colors, but that&#039;s what our GC was using anyway....)<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/nyregion/13experience.html?_r=0<br /><br />I would call the store, find when he&#039;s there and try and go on off-hours. Be nice and polite to him; he deals with UES prima-donnas all day and a little politeness goes a long way!<br /><br />Take pictures&nbsp; with you of your space/furniture/art etc. <br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/janovic-paint-and-decorating-center-new-york-2

				Cassat, I can totally empathize. I agonized over white paint colors before we moved in:<br /><br />http://renov8or.blogspot.com/2014/03/choosing-paint-why-choosing-white-paint.html<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, I could not be happier with our final choice, Farrow &amp; Ball &quot;blackened&quot;. It&#039;s a white that has a silvery gray cast in certain lights. It looks very fresh and modern. And seems to go with everything.<br /><br />

				Thanks so much to you both! I had never heard of Farrow and Ball. I&#039;m quite intrigued and plan to avail myself of the the stores&#039; free 15m colour consultation. And also planning to visit Paul, the B Moore guru (he&#039;s still at the Lexington Ave location).&nbsp; My migraines are starting to feel rather exquisite... in a good way ; )

				Sadly, I didn&#039;t end up having enough time to do the consultations properly (Paul was out sick and I ended up dealing with his assistant).&nbsp; But I did want to share with you Benjamin Moore&#039;s exciting new colour range for 2015 - see attached photo :)

				haha, that link was not what I was expecting!&nbsp; Antique ham, LOL. <br /><br />I painted most of my apartment in Benjamin Moore paint, but the most recent room I did was with Sherwin Williams - I was surprised that I liked the quality of the SW paint more than BM (and I used the higher grades of BM like Aura).&nbsp;

				I am an artist and color consultant. It&#039;s always a good idea to &quot;live&quot; with the color chip you choose under different lighting situations. I would suggest a session in your home to discuss&nbsp; color options and steps to making the best color choice. Contact: 917 374 0425.<br />
