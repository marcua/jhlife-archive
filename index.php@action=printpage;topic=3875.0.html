				I&#039;d like to know also.&nbsp; Do these things actually work well?&nbsp; My windows face 35th Avenue, and the dust accumulates quicky.&nbsp; I find that I have to dust every other day... not fun.&nbsp; When I lived on 71st Street I didn&#039;t have that much of a problem, but then the side streets see less traffic from buses, etc.

				We have Sharper Image air purifiers.&nbsp; They work extremely well and are easy to clean but according to the instructions you are not supposed to use them with the windows open.&nbsp; I find that I have my windows open so much, that I end up leaving them unplugged most of the time.&nbsp; Go figure.

				We use <strong>Blue Air Air Filters</strong>. They are great for dust and pollen and allergens.<br /><br />Beware of air cleaners with ionizers is you have any breathing problems - especially asthma. They increase ozone and cause breathing problems. I think the Sharper Image cleaners are in this category.

				I have two.&nbsp; They work well, but are a bit noisy, since they work by blowing a lot of air.&nbsp; Think of them as white noise machines, and they&#039;re tolerable.<br /><br />I only use them occasionally.&nbsp; You&#039;re welcome to borrow one to try it out.
