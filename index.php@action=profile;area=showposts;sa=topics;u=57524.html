					Today I noticed an aggressive homeless white man, about 6&#039;2&#039;&#039; on 37th Ave.&nbsp; He was walking up and down 37th Ave in the afternoon sort of kicking things around. He looked at me aggressively - sort of angry - when I was walking holding my girls&#039; hands (ages 3 and 5). In the evening I saw him sitting in front of the liquor store on 76th and 37th Ave.&nbsp; He had what appeared to be a pile of US Postal mail that he was going through and literally throwing the stuff on the floor after going through it.&nbsp; He looked at me like he wanted to fight. He was looking at other folks the same way.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What the hell is going on in this neighborhood?&nbsp; I hope its not a harbinger for things to come.&nbsp; Let&#039;s not kid ourselves, DiBlasio is probably the worst mayor we have ever had in this city.&nbsp; He has done nothing to deal with this population.&nbsp; The police are completely absent.&nbsp; I suspect that he&#039;s going to hurt somebody at some point.&nbsp;

					Hello Neighbors,<br /><br />I wanted to tap into the collective wisdom of our community concerning a remodeling issue that I have.&nbsp; On that note, I respectfully request that you provide me with recommendations of vendors who can build and install built-in bookshelves, with room for a TV.&nbsp; (I am aware that this topic has been discussed in the past, but the administrator suggested that I start a new topic.)<br /><br />The following link from the NYT On the Market section demonstrates the type of work that I would like to have done:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2018/12/06/realestate/on-the-market-in-the-new-york-region/s/09OTM-NYC-slide-2ZN2.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2018/12/06/realestate/on-the-market-in-the-new-york-region/s/09OTM-NYC-slide-2ZN2.html</a><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />For those of you who have had built-in bookshelves installed in your apartment, any regrets?&nbsp; How much did it cost?&nbsp; Was it worth it?&nbsp; I want to as minimal depth to the bookshelves as possible; how deep are your bookshelves? <br /><br />Thank you for all your help.&nbsp; I truly appreciate it.&nbsp;

					I wanted to take note of the fact that I had an extremely positive experience with the local NYPD.&nbsp; A couple of vagrants decided to set up shop in front of our building.&nbsp; They were smoking weed and drinking beer right out in front of the main entrance.&nbsp; Granted, it was in the evening - at around 10 p.m. - so it was not as bad as it could have been.&nbsp; In any case, I called 311 and they transferred it to 911.&nbsp; The police were here within minutes.&nbsp; They were respectful to the vagrants and got them to move the party along.&nbsp; We were happy because we felt our needs were addressed immediately.&nbsp; It will make me more likely to call the police for assistance when it is necessary to keep the neighborhood safe and pleasant for owners/renters.

					I think that it makes sense for the government to exercise its eminent domain powers to seize the car dealership on Northern Boulevard to expand Travers&#039; Park. I focus on the car dealership as opposed to the Garden School because the school serves a greater public good in that it provides parents in the neighborhood with greater educational options whereas the car dealership has no comparable intrinsic public good - this argument only works if one assumes that the promotion of education is a public good.&nbsp; It would be much harder to make a case for the government seizing a school in a neighborhood like JH as opposed to a car dealership, which there are already plenty of.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another reason it makes sense for the government to seize the car dealership is because there are renovations planned for Travers Park and seizing that one lot is administratively simple to the extent that there will only be one proceeding involving one lot.&nbsp; The community would reap tremendous benefits that will dwarf whatever negative consequences the landowner will suffer, i.e., the landlord will be compensated with money and will be able to buy another piece of property, whereas the public will have a larger public space intended to promote community cohesiveness and provide residents with opportunities to participate in recreational and cultural activities and/or events.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has there been any serious discussion about this issue?&nbsp; Is this the kind of community that can band together and force the government to invest more than is already planned?&nbsp;

					I cannot understand why anybody would feed pigeons/squirrels in our neighborhood.&nbsp; The leftover food creates an unsanitary condition to the extent that rats will eat the leftovers and the pigeons poop all over the place - including unsuspecting members of the community.&nbsp; Moreover, after being fed by humans squirrels become more aggressive when looking for food.&nbsp; I really don&#039;t understand why anybody would do this to their neighbors.&nbsp;
