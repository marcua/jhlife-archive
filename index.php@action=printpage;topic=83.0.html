				If you go to a gym, where do you go?<br /><br />When I first moved here I joined EFN, the small gym overlooking the 7 train tracks on 78th and Roosevelt.&nbsp; I got what I thought was a good deal but I have since gotten offers that were even lower ($199 a year was the lowest I&nbsp; have seen).&nbsp; I bought a year&#039;s membership but ultimately stopped going, because even though it was close and open late -- I didn&#039;t enjoy going there.&nbsp; <br /><br />The gym does have decent basic equipment (a step up from some YMCAs I have belonged to in my past) but I found it to be too small, too crowded, not clean enough and hot in the spring (I never went in summer).&nbsp; It seems perfect if you want a nearby gym for a quick basic workout, but if you want more than that, this probably isn&#039;t the place for you.&nbsp; I never tried the classes there so I can&#039;t comment on those.<br /><br />After my membership ran out there, I joined NYSC which opened a branch next to the R/V train in Rego Park over the summer, and is about to open another branch within a week or so in Sunnyside on 39th and Queens Blvd close to the 40th St. Stop on the 7.&nbsp; I pay about $67/month.&nbsp; I&#039;m very happy with NYSC after having gone to too many sub-par gyms over the years.<br /><br />I know other people here in JH who were going to the gym on Northern Blvd (can&#039;t remember the name).&nbsp; Is it still open?&nbsp; I think they had some problems.&nbsp; Also I know someone else who treks over to Astoria to go the Rock Gym there.<br /><br />So. . .where do you work out?

				The gym on northern closed- I heard the egress was a fire hazard. I went to the Rock in astoria when it first opened when I lived over there- it was really good. The matrix gym in astoria (ditmars and 40-something, in the Berry Farms shopping center) is a decent gym, and it&#039;s cheaper and closer to JH than the rock (and has a parking lot). My old roommates used to go there.

				I also went to EFN when I first moved out here but it just kind of never did it for me. I&#039;m not sure why. Eventually I skipped searching for a gym and bought a Spinning bike for my apartment. I love it (when I use it) but could definitely use a bit of outside motivation. I might check out the NYSC in Rego Park. I used to belong to one when I lived on the Upper East Side and it was pretty good.

				I went to check out the NYSC in Sunnyside yesterday (right now only open for tours) and while it&#039;s of course a brand new facility with all new machines, it seemed small. I think I prefer the Rego Park location.&nbsp; From the 74th St. station I think the time to get to each one on the train is about the same (6 stops on the local R/V vs. about the same on the 7).&nbsp; <br /><br />However, if you need sunlight in order to do your time on the treadmill, you&#039;ll prefer the Sunnyside one as the Rego Park facility is entirely underground.

				Just saw a Pilates mat class advertised on a flyer on the door of Espresso 77.<br /><br />And yesterday from the opposite side of the street noticed a &quot;Curves&quot; circuit training place for women on Northern Blvd. but couldn&#039;t tell if it was an old place that had already closed or if it&#039;s new and just about to arrive (or somewhere in between).&nbsp; It was in the lower &#039;80s on Northern on the north side.

				So today I logged into see if anyone was talking about local gyms and I was glad to find this thread.<br />I heeded Shelby2&#039;s reviews and headed out to Rego Park to check out the NYSC there. The place looks great and the location/trek isn&#039;t bad at all. Only problem I had was how horrible the club rep was and perhaps the company policies. Basically they wouldn&#039;t tell me anything about the club unless I gave them my phone number which I refused to do. They claimed it was company policy to gather phone numbers first and the guy said he would be calling me twice a week. If I was signing up to join I would understand the need for personal info, but all I wanted was to learn about the club. The meeting ended with me just turning away and leaving disgruntled and disappointed. I have never had such an unpleasant time while just looking into joining a gym (which I have done numerous times). Too bad, because I looks to be a very nice facility. Perhaps it&#039;s better in Sunnyside.<br />Wonder if anyone else has dealt with this?

				There is another gym that is relatively close that I belong to called Big Six Fitness.&nbsp; It is 61-10 Queens Blvd 2nd Floor, Woodside.&nbsp; Many people remember it as a Gold&#039;s Gym that only recently changed owners.&nbsp; They have all the same equipment as the old Golds including clean locker rooms and an aerobics room used for classes.&nbsp; They offer spin classes every day along with various other strength training courses.&nbsp; If you drive it is only 10 min, I ride a bike to the gym and it takes 15 min at most.&nbsp; They allow cyclists to bring their bikes inside to the front desk/juice bar.&nbsp; If you take the subway it is NOT as easy or fast to get there.&nbsp; It involves getting off the 7 at 61st Woodside and heading towards Queens Blvd up 61st St.&nbsp; I believe the yearly membership is $475.00, they also offer a free 7 day trial pass.&nbsp; I find it to be the best deal around ONLY if you are willing to ride your bike or brave crossing Queens Blvd on foot!

				I live near the curves on Northern Boulevard.&nbsp; Just thought I would let you know that it has been open for business for around two years now. I have several freinds who go there and are happy.&nbsp; It is quite small though.&nbsp; I visited but did not join, only because I am quite lazy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The pilates is given on Friday nights at the Garden school.&nbsp; Ladies who attend have enjoyed it.&nbsp;

				The Sunnyside NYSC is supposed to finally open its doors for working out this coming week on Dec. 28.&nbsp; It&#039;s been open for tours for the past several weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Diogenes, sorry to hear about your experience at the Rego Park branch.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember what happened to me the first time I went to check out a NYSC for possible membership.&nbsp; I know that I didn&#039;t join til several months later at a different branch, so either they did not ask for my number or I gave them my &#039;home&#039; number which is a VOIP number that never rings and where messages go directly into an email attachment, so I don&#039;t have to worry about giving out the number.<br /><br />In terms of its business practices, NYSC seems much better than my old gym, Ballys, which is notorious for charging people when they try to (legitimately) get out of their contracts.

				I belong to Matrix Fitness on 45st and Ditmars Boulevard.&nbsp; The club is very clean and it is big big.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t quite as nice at the NYSC on Steinway but it is about $30-40 cheaper per month and you don&#039;t have to commit for a year.&nbsp; It is month by month.&nbsp; I joined in October and the plan I chose was an initiation fee of $179 and a monthly fee of $49.95. As long as you continue your membership the price will never go up.

				Gladiator, the gym on Northern was a lot like EFN.&nbsp; I stopped going after a few weeks and it eventually closed down.<br /><br />LaGuardia CC, on 33rd and Rawson, has a rather affordable gym (free for students) with minimal riff-raff.<br /><br />My absolute favorite thing to do though is go to Astoria Park (you know, those places with grass), which has a track, calisthenics around the track, Olympic sized pool, plenty of room to sunbathe, and a tennis court.&nbsp; Plus a river-side view of Manhattan.<br /><br />In fact, I may regret letting the secret out... what am I doing?

				I belong to EFN. It works for me in the winter because it is a 5-minute walk; it&#039;s too hot in the summer. But my biggest problem with them is the noise level.&nbsp; :( (Used to belong to Bally&#039;s, had the same problem).<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand getting one&#039;s body in shape while losing one&#039;s hearing...<br /><br />Given that anyone can bring their own music in the form of an iPod or Walkman, why must gyms blast music at us? Can anyone report on whether the NYSC at Sunnyside is QUIETER?<br /><br />

				They do play music at NYSC in Sunnyside but it&#039;s been fairly quiet the few times I&#039;ve been.&nbsp; And the music they do play is more the sort I enjoy instead of the hard-rocker stuff that they sometimes play at gyms I&#039;ve been to in the past.

				The worst gym ever! <br />Someone please open a decent gym in JH, we have coffee but we need a decent gym. EFN is a dump no AC, it is so overcrowded that you have to sign up for a treadmill two hours in advance and machines are broken a they never fix them. I know EFN is cheap but it is still a rip off!!!

				I was wandering Astorians.com and found a thread about gyms. There are a few new ones in Astoria -- and one is very convenient to the Steinway stop and the bus stop:<br /><br />http://www.evolutionsportsclub.com/flash_index.html<br /><br />Has anybody tried it? I just called and, if you sign up for a one year contract, it&#039;s $58 a month with no other fees. They&#039;re even open 24 hours Monday-Thursday and 7a-10p on the weekends. I&#039;ll stop by there soon but, in the meantime, if anybody has looked at it, I&#039;d love to hear what you thought.

				There was a sales guy at NYSC in Sunnyside asking me if I had any friends who wanted to join so I took the opportunity to ask about the charter membership rates at that location.&nbsp; He said the initial fee to get started is about $70, and the monthly fee is $59.&nbsp; I imagine this is the basic membership where you can go to the Sunnyside location at any hour but you are restricted to the off-hours at the other locations.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how long this rate will be offered.&nbsp; He suggsted it might only last through this weekend, but my experience with gym salespeople is that they always tell you the rate is about to go up if you don&#039;t join right away.&nbsp; The guy I talked to was Paul and his number is 718-361-2254.

				EFN works for me because it&#039;s so close and because I go quite early in the morning.<br /><br />With the broken machines, the lack of AC and the crowds, though, I think NYSC or another chain could easily poach <strong>MANY</strong> of their customers if they opened in JH.&nbsp; It would also be great to belong to a gym with a location close to home and close to work.<br /><br />In the meantime, I guess it&#039;s EFN... :-\

				My biggest gripe about living in Jackson Heights was that we had no decent gym.&nbsp; My wife and I tried to make a go at EFN for the last year but the lack of ac in the summer and the hour and half wait to use treadmills that are really run down challenged the most dedicated gym rats, which we are not. After Lettyâ€™s, Espresso 77 and now Cannelle opened up, my wife and I had to find a decent gym to work off all the cheese cake, scones and chocolate croissants or give up our new addictions.&nbsp; After extensive research looking for the closest decent gym, we settled on Evolution Sports Club.&nbsp; It is located on 34-30 37th Street in Astoria; it is right next to the Museum of the Moving Image, has free parking after 4 pm and is a block and a half from the Steinway stop. The gym is really spacious, has new equipment (14 treadmills and 16 elliptical machines), every kind of weight lifting machine possible, a sauna and steam room.&nbsp; The owner Anthony is not pushy like at NYSC and he is really chill; he lets his gym speak for itself. I spoke to the owner and told him about the gym situation here and he told us he would offer a special for Jackson Heights $559 for the year (the regular price is $787) with no initiation fees (just let him know you are from Jackson Heights). They also offer a month to month membership with a year contract for $59 and a no contract membership for $69. They offer a bunch of classes but I really didnâ€™t pay attention to that part. The website says they offer free childcare but we do not have children so we did not follow up on that. <br />My wife and I work out during peak hours 5-8pm and we havenâ€™t had to wait for a treadmill or machine yet so the commute is worth it for us.<br /><br />

				<em>I got permission to copy and paste this from the JH families yahoo group. Please take a moment to click the link and send the feedback if you think having a NYSC in JH would be worthwhile!</em><br /><br />I spoke with someone at the corporate offices for NYSC last week and asked<br />them if they were planning to open up a Jackson Heights location. The guy I<br />spoke with couldn&#039;t find any record of a new JH location, however he<br />encouraged me to tell people to go to the following link and voice their<br />interest in NYSC coming to Jackson Heights. More specifically, he said if we<br />made mention of a particular space (i.e., the old Gladiator Gym Space at<br />82-24 Northern Blvd), and if the response was big enough, they would likely<br />come and check it out. There is apparently precedent for NYSC opening up<br />new locations with a large public response.<br /><br />This is the link:<br /><br />https://www.mysportsclubs.com/feedback.htm<br /><br />Let&#039;s let NYSC know that there is a huge demand for a gym in JH and that the<br />Gladiator space would be a perfect location. Our collective voices have been<br />effective in the past and could be again.<br /><br />

				According to Reply #1 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=83.msg254#msg254) in this thread, Gladiator may have closed because of fire code violations.&nbsp; If those can&#039;t easily be fixed, the location may not be suitable for NYSC.&nbsp; So it might be a good idea to include other ideas for locations if we can come up with any.

				I like the NYSC in Sunnyside because it&#039;s brand new and it&#039;s street level with lots of sunlight throughout.&nbsp; However, it&#039;s really TINY.&nbsp; It&#039;s the smallest NYSC I&#039;ve ever seen.&nbsp; I have a flexible schedule so I can work out off peak hours but I could imagine that when it gets crowded the going gets a bit tough in there.

			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve been going to the BQE for more than two years now, since moving to JH from Manhattan (where I belonged to an NYSC by NYU for many years), and my experience has been quite good (compared to the moderator of this thread, who snidely trashed the place back in February--he&#039;d obviously not been there in a while). Compared to how dingy and disorganized it was when I first joined, the place is now spacious and relatively well layed out (it&#039;s apparently grown by additions over the years), and the aerobic equipment and much of the free weights are new and plentiful. Complaints regarding cleanliness must have registered, because a cleaning crew is constantly mopping and wiping down equipment. The men&#039;s locker room, at least, is also recently renovated, with sauna and steam. There is no pool, but there are handball courts. There&#039;s also an area with punching bags for boxing and kick-boxing. The place is open 24 hours, as far as I know, and has aerobic and spinning classes, although I&#039;ve never attended. I try to go midday, when there aren&#039;t so many people around. Late afternoons, of course, can be very busy. While the gym has a very diverse clientele, in keeping with the surrounding neighborhoods, it&#039;s predominantly Hispanic (at least midday). It&#039;s also diverse very diverse with regard to age, gender, sexual orientation, fitness level, etc. etc.. I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s popular with NYC cops; there was an article in the NYT four or five years ago that described it as popular with cabbies, who liked it&#039;s proximity to the BQE expressway and came in the wee hours to work out. There are stairs between three floors--no elevators--in case this is an issue for you.<br /><br />Regarding cost, the BQE is apparently much cheaper than a lot of places mentioned here. I rejoined before the renovation was complete and paid around $400 for 2 years if I recall. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s more now. As for location, I live on 75th and travel to and from the gym by bike. The distance is perfect for bike, but too far for walking, and it&#039;s not near any train or bus.&nbsp; Of course if you drive it&#039;s no problem, they have a small lot and I observe most people parking on the street. <br /><br />The BQE works great for me and I think it&#039;s definitely worth checking out (in contrast to others who were commenting here last winter), but I hope a lot more people don&#039;t join!<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.bqefitnesscenter.net/ (http://www.bqefitnesscenter.net/)

				I just joined this gym a month ago, and I have to say, you get what you pay for.&nbsp; I was a member of the rock over in astoria for 5 years and it was extremely clean and well maintained.&nbsp; It was also pretty expensive.&nbsp; Now that I moved, BQE is the closest gym to me and it has parking which is a huge plus.&nbsp; The place isn&#039;t as clean as I&#039;m used to, and the equipment isn&#039;t maintained as well.&nbsp; There are a lot of machines though, and I&#039;ve never had to wait for a treadmill or elliptical machine even though there is a pretty good crowd in there.&nbsp; In my mind it is a good alternative because the cheaper price more than makes up for the conditions of the gym.&nbsp; It&#039;s not horrible, so don&#039;t think that, but it could use a little more cleaning and maintnance.&nbsp; For the price, it&#039;s a bargain though.

I&#039;ve been driving to Astoria to my gym 2-3x a week and it&#039;s very difficult and with the risk of traffic, makes it impossible to go in the morning (ok, I&#039;m not a morning person).<br /><br />It looks like Big Six will be my best option (nearest).&nbsp; Before I go in there, any comments on this gym?&nbsp; I didn&#039;t really see much in the earlier part of this thread. Also, does anyone mind telling me what they pay?&nbsp; I need to know what I should try bargaining for.&nbsp; As a previous poster said, all gym memberships are negotiable.

				Thought I would bump this thread back up...&nbsp; I still go to my gym in Astoria and it&#039;s rather inconvenient (I go at night due to work schedule--lose my parking space at home, have to find parking in Astoria, and then need to find parking at home at around 10pm)<br /><br />Looks like my best bet would be Big Six Fitness on Queens Blvd in Woodside.&nbsp; Does anyone go here?&nbsp; Any recent thoughts on this gym?&nbsp; Price?&nbsp; How is the equipment?&nbsp; My Astoria gym (Synergy) expires in April, and I&#039;m looking forward to trying a new place.&nbsp; Google turns up surprisingly little on Big Six, and they do not have a website.

				C11106 before your membership is up in Astoria, call a few gyms you&#039;re interested in checking out cuz a lot of them have free two week trial passes.&nbsp; I know Matrix does.&nbsp; I would think in this economic climate any gym would be willing to let you come and &quot;trial&quot; them before you join.<br /><br />Keep us posted since gyms, like a lot businesses, seem to come and go.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know I&#039;ve said this already up this thread but Matrix has indoor and outdoor free parking and was not expensive and it was always clean.&nbsp; Out of all the gyms I belonged to while living in Queens, it was one of my faves.<br /><br />Good luck hunting.

				About a year ago, when I went to the Sunnyside NYSC (which I like because it&#039;s very clean), I asked the woman at the front desk if the company had considered opening in Jackson Heights. She told me that NYSC is very aware that there&#039;s a market for them in the neighborhood and that they are looking for a space. Who knows how informed she really was, but I&#039;m hopeful they&#039;ll open in JH one of these days. I&#039;m not exactly holding my breath given the lack of vacant commercial space large enough to hold a gym. But maybe if those of us who would use a NYSC here could let the company know, it might help.

				What terrible customer service gyms around here have!<br /><br />My gym membership to Synergy in Astoria expires next week.&nbsp; I like Synergy, but the drive to Astoria can add up to an extra 1/2 hour each way with the traffic. I just don&#039;t have the time to add an extra hour to my gym time.<br /><br />I decided to look at the nearest gyms to my house (where I can walk there), with the full intention of joining one today and paying them upfront for the year.&nbsp; Really, I went in as the easiest &quot;sell&quot; ever.<br /><br />First I went to Big 6 on 61st/Queens Blvd.&nbsp; I went there, and said I was thinking about joining and would like to see the gym.&nbsp; I was handed a couple of flyers and told I could look around.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t seem to care either way if I joined, and I wasn&#039;t told anything about the gym at all.&nbsp; Although, I will note that I did go on a Sunday afternoon and there was a young-looking girl behind the counter.&nbsp; I know I&#039;ve been a member of good gyms with good trainers in the past where part time help, usually students work the counter on the weekends.&nbsp; Full-time staff and trainers work during the week.&nbsp; Perhaps that was the case here.&nbsp; As far as what I viewed of the gym, it looked nice and there were plenty of new-looking machines and equipment.<br /><br />Then I went to Bally&#039;s (Queens Blvd, somewhere in the 70s).&nbsp; I went to the front desk and the rude woman behind the counter insisted I show her my ID and fill out an information form before she would tell me anything else.&nbsp; I filled out my name and address on the form, but didn&#039;t write my phone number down, and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Then she tells me that someone has to come to show me around but she was &quot;with a client&quot;.&nbsp; I asked how long it would be, and she called the manager that came.&nbsp; The manager was nice enough, showed me the gym, but the gym was very small and crowded.&nbsp; Crowded like when you can feel in air how many people are breathing.. gross!&nbsp; I said I wasn&#039;t interested and left.&nbsp; <br /><br />With my crazy schedule, proximity really is the most important thing I am looking for in a gym right now, so I&#039;m going to go back and join Big 6.&nbsp; They handed me some flyers with some rates I would have to talk down (because I could join through globalfit through my insurance company and it would be cheaper), but they also have a special now to join for 6 months for $199.&nbsp; $33 a month, which is what globalfit would charge.

				Jackson Heights desperately needs a good gym.&nbsp; EFN may be cheap, but most of the machines and their TVs are broken and it&#039;s so crowded that it&#039;s hard to even get a machine to use during peak hours.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve decided to start a campaign to try and convince NYSC or any other chain to open up a gym.&nbsp; Actually, I don&#039;t really care if it&#039;s a chain or well-known gym, I just want a relatively clean gym with machines that work.<br /><br />There used to be Gladiator Health Club on Northern Blvd. b/t 82nd and 83rd Street but that closed down about 2 years ago, and the space is still empty.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping that someone will reopen a gym there and put some new machines in.&nbsp; The address was 82-24 Northern Blvd.<br /><br />So, if you would like another gym in Jackson Heights to open, then please join my campaign and email some of the major chains like NYSC and ask them to bring a gym to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &nbsp;Follow this link and send them an email. <br />https://www.mysportsclubs.com/feedback.htm<br />&nbsp;<br />You can also become a fan of my facebook page: Jackson Heights 11372 needs a nice gym!!!!<br /><br />

				TO ALL JH LIFERS:<br /><br />After my workout today at the EFN Zone Gym (78th and Roosevelt) I spoke with the front desk about the topic of the lack of cleanliness at the gym.&nbsp; They agreed with me and indicated they have a full-time employee who cleans day and night, but unfortunately some members are not considerate.&nbsp; That is obvious from what I have read here on this site.&nbsp; Although, truthfully I have been so concentrated on loosing my extra 100 lbs. and that&#039;s all I can focus on when I am at the gym.&nbsp; I really haven&#039;t paid much attention to anything else.&nbsp; But I do have an appointment to meet with the owner tomorrow and I will address this issue.&nbsp; :smiley6600:

				Marlene--congrats on being so motivated! I hope they fix that cleanliness issue for you...&nbsp; If not, maybe you can bring some sanitizing wipes along with you?<br /><br />When I went to Big 6 this past weekend, they gave me a &quot;free 7-day trial membership&quot; card.&nbsp; I went there to work out last night, and I think I&#039;m going to officially join this weekend.&nbsp; I went at 8:30pm, and the gym wasn&#039;t terribly crowded.&nbsp; I easily got the cardio machine I wanted.&nbsp; I got a bit of a &quot;meathead&quot; vibe in there, but they don&#039;t really bother me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I figure at least they are there to really work out!&nbsp; There were a few of those annoying-type girls who clearly spend an hour putting on makeup and doing their hair before they go.&nbsp; Everything seemed decently clean, and I haven&#039;t used the weight machines yet, but they look clean and safe.&nbsp; Surprisingly, guy at the front desk filled out my free 7-day paperwork and didn&#039;t try to get me to officially join or ask me any of those annoying questions they ask when they try to get you to join (&quot;What are you goals?&quot;--MY GOAL IS TO WORK OUT).<br /><br />I was really thinking of doing BQE instead, per Buddy&#039;s suggestion, but this gym is SO CLOSE to my apartment, and I could walk if necessary, like when it&#039;s the night before alternate side of street parking and I don&#039;t want to move my car!&nbsp; It&#039;s really all about proximity...

				C11106 I am motivated and I&#039;ll make sure to bring those wipes and some cleaning solutions with me as well.&nbsp; Who knows, I might end up getting a better work out by cleaning the joint.&nbsp; You think?&nbsp; Again, I have to loose 100 lbs.&nbsp; I need to be close to a gym (any gym) and EFN works.&nbsp; I don&#039;t pay attention to much other than myself and my breathing.&nbsp; The gym is two blocks away, open 24/7, no water fountain, but water can be purchased, and the membership is cheap.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to take the car, train, or bus, and I can get home quickly and move on to other things.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to fuss for hours about hair, and makeup and the outfit, so I&#039;m good.&nbsp; I missed the guy spitting, but again I&#039;m too busy.&nbsp; Air conditioning is really not that important for me as I need to sweat.&nbsp; But I gotta tell you, as a former member of the 92nd Street Y in the city, I do need the steam room, or a sauna, so the fact that EFN has no a/c works just fine for now.&nbsp; And truthfully speaking, when you want to get a work out, you can get one anywhere if you are focused.&nbsp; That seems to be where I am right now.&nbsp; Also, I spoke with the owner today and I&#039;ll have an update soon.&nbsp; :smiley6600:<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been to other planet fitness locations, and the gym was clean,with lots of nice new equipment.&nbsp; As for staff, just a few high school/college kids sitting behind the front desk.&nbsp; Planet Fitness is the &quot;judgment-free zone&quot; where they try to eliminate meathead-like behavior.&nbsp; They do not have very heavy weights and have a rule against grunting. (seriously, check out the website).&nbsp; I felt that the one I used to go to had a lot of useless people standing around socializing instead of really working out.&nbsp; I guess they were brought in by the low price and the &quot;judgment-free&quot; motto.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, though, I would recommend PF, as it&#039;s very hard to find the cleanliness/low price combination around here.&nbsp; Only thing is that there is no parking lot and I think street parking would be a nightmare around there.&nbsp; You could take the R or V train to the Steinway St. stop,though.

				I think EFN on Roosevelt is a scam. They charge a low yearly rate, and far too many more people have signed up than can actually fit inside. So you go a couple of times, realize it&#039;s swelteringly hot, and that there&#039;s no room to move around, and all the machines are taken (if they&#039;re working at all). Since you only paid a couple hundred bucks, you don&#039;t feel so bad about not going. And voila--EFN gets a few hundred dollars and you never use their facility. It&#039;s really perfect, actually.

				Hi.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for somewhere to exercise. I guess I need a class or some sort of group, but I don&#039;t want all the bells and whistles (personal trainer, nutrition advice, etc). I&#039;ve never joined a gym before, so I&#039;m not even sure what is offered or what to ask. Any advice or suggestions?

				Some questions to ask yourself:<br /><br />-how far are you willing to travel to go to the gym?<br />-does it need to be near a train or have parking?<br />-how late/early do you need it to be open?<br />-how clean do you need the locker rooms to be?<br />-would a more heavy weightlifting atmosphere be bothersome?<br />-what kind of class or group are you looking for? <br />-how up-to-date do you need the machines to be?<br />-would you need the gym to provide towels or anything in the locker room like shampoo?<br /><br />A general word of advice about gyms: in my experience, memberships are negotiable. &nbsp;Many will tell you they have a special going on &quot;today only&quot; and that if you walk out the door, the price will surely rise in the time it takes you to make up your mind. &nbsp;High pressure sales tactics. &nbsp;Don&#039;t fall for it.<br /><br />If you need to find a gym right here in JH, the options are severely limited. &nbsp;You could check out EFN Zone at 78th and Roosevelt. &nbsp;<br /><br />If you are open to gyms in different areas, then I suggest you find out if the ones you are interested in will offer a free trial workout. &nbsp;This is a good way to see if you like the atmosphere. For gyms in Woodside, Astoria, etc. read &nbsp;the thread on local gyms, health clubs and exercise spots &nbsp;(http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=83.0).<br /><br />

				Yeah, you can spend as much or as little as you want. $50- $100/month seems about standard. I know Ballys is cheaper. But you get what you pay for. The one in Elmhurst is inconvenient and not very nice. You can even spend nothing and get a great workout in your apartment or the park. It&#039;s all about the atmosphere and extras your want. <br /><br />Keep in mind too, that gyms make their money from people with good intentions who end up not using the gym but still paying the monthly fee. I recommend trying out different gyms to see what you like. Most any gym will give you a free day or week to try them out. Just don&#039;t give in to the hard sell right away. This approach will help you see what&#039;s really important to you and make an educated choice. It will also help you see if your heart is really in it. If after 2 weeks of workouts you find you&#039;re not going anymore, at least you won&#039;t be stuck with a monthly gym bill.

				Lucielle Roberts is around $325 with a 2 year contract.&nbsp; If you want to do monthly its around $10-12 per month and every 6 months a maintenance fee of I think 10-15 dollars.<br /><br />I use to go to the one on Steinway hopping on the G,V or R train to Steinway.&nbsp; I paid $40 bucks more to upgrade to gold, meaning I can use other gyms.&nbsp; So now I frequent the one on 71 Continental, a one express stop towards Jamaica.&nbsp; Both take me 10 minutes to get to by train.<br /><br />First use a free 5 day pass and see if you like the gym.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use to be a NY Sports Club member, but that can cost to more than $100 a month.&nbsp; Over there, I would get a new towel, sometimes shampoo, (key locker-some locations) and massages.&nbsp; Big difference in machines.&nbsp; I remember their running machines had headphone pug-in to listen to their own tv network.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some gyms are 24/7.&nbsp; Try the out before paying.&nbsp; Also just for canceling my NY Sports Club membership within 2 years, I got charged around $175 and an extra month since their policy is to tell them one month in advance.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you need any further information, feel free to message me. <br /><br />Also, taking classes with your friends is fun.&nbsp; The classes at 71 Continental get very very packed.&nbsp; Perhaps 100+.&nbsp; Its not as crowded at Steinway. Both have waiting lists for the Elliptical during rush hours.&nbsp; Ask the reps when both get busy.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<strong></strong><em></em>I recommend BQE gym, located on BQE service road(southbound) and 25th avenue. The address is 26-50 BQE West. phone 718-726-4343. About 10 min by bike to get there. Best club in the area, open 24 hours, very spacious 3 story building. It has lots of equipment plus many different classes like yoga and others. Modern, clean and well maintained club. And most importnant it&#039;s not crowded. Membership is a mere $300.

				I strongly second Matrix Gym.&nbsp; It is about $55 for a month by month.&nbsp; I pay a little less because I have been a member for <br />2 1/2 years.&nbsp; If you continue your membership without a break your monthly price will never go up.&nbsp; I was a member of NYSC in Astoria and when I quit 2 /12 years ago my monthly cost was above $80 and going up every year.&nbsp; I also used to pay another $10-$20 a month for municipal parking.&nbsp; Matrix has free parking&nbsp; but the only catch is can you get a parking space when you return to JH.

				Count me as another happy Matrix-goer.&nbsp; It does depend on what the person looks for in a gym, and I miss the New York Sports Clubs I used to go to in other neighborhoods.&nbsp; After moving here, I used to drive to the NYSC in Astoria, but paying to park in the municipal lot and the ever-increasing NYSC fees got to me.&nbsp; The free parking at Matrix makes a big difference - if you have a car (and can park back in JH afterwards).&nbsp; Still seems funny to me to drive to the gym, but until something else opens up nearby, it works for me.&nbsp; There are also NYSC locations convenient by subway, as Shelby2 mentioned.

				I attended the new yoga place on Roosevelt Ave and 79 Street. It was a pre-opening class and the opening will be the weekend of the 13th. The class was of Vinyasa Yoga and was given by Mimi. The class was great, I am new to Yoga so the poses were new to me but not difficult and Mimi was very good at explaining the proper posture and feeling or insight for the pose. Her instruction was helpful, fun and towards the end of the class soothing. I will be back.<br /><br />Anyone interested I copied the following info from the flyer on the door: Yoga-Friendly, Mat Pilates, Yoga Dance, Meditation, Dance-a-licious, Belly dance, Massage Therapy.&nbsp; 79-05 Roosevelt Ave, Jackson Heights, NY 11372<br />call 917-561-5501 or e-mail mimiforme@gmail.com<br /><br />Again I really enjoyed the class and am looking forward to the next one.

				Has anyone tried BQE gym? I used to go a long time ago...it was full of a &#039;Jersey-Shore&#039; type crowd&nbsp; :2funny: but did not seem too bad, they also had some limited parking. I use Evolution in Astoria but driving there everyday sucks since I add a lot of time trying to find parking. Also, since I work afternoons they barely have any classes for the morning crowd which is a real downer. It is a small gym and a bit crowded at times but very clean and the staff is always very friendly and nice which helps a lot but I need something closer to home, some place which I can walk to but sadly the selection of quality gyms in JH is so limited. &gt;:(

				I go to Planet Fitness as well too- it&#039;s roughly on my way home from work, and it&#039;s seriously affordable. If you&#039;re looking for classes or anything it&#039;s not the right place for you, but if you&#039;re looking for a low key, cheap place to use a treadmill, elliptical, free weights or resistance machines,&nbsp; it&#039;s pretty awesome.

				Hello, I just saw this post and wanted to tell you about Mimi for Me Yoga. They offer yoga of course, Pilate&#039;s, and different dance type fitmess classes. I have been attending since they opened and it has been quite an experience. I haven&#039;t done the Pilate&#039;s but I hear it&#039;s a really nice workout. i have done the yoga and being new to yoga has been an eye opener, not at all what I expected. It was a workout, it was relaxing and it was insightful all in one package. Take a look at their webpage for a schedule.&nbsp; The studio itself is newly renovated, comfortable, clean and inviting. The staff is friendly, helpful, and also inviting. It is at the least a must try out place. Hope this was helpful.

I was there a month ago, so some of the details are sketchy now. It&#039;s a storefront-sized space, I&#039;d estimate that it&#039;s 1500 to 2000 square feet (just a guess). The first 1/3rd is cardio, with bikes and treadmills. The middle 1/3rd of the room seems to be exercise machines (not Nautilus or Universal, but along those lines). Pulleys and plates and cams. The machines looked nice enough. The back 1/3rd of the gym is free weights, with dumbells (up to 100 pounds) a flat bench press, an incline bench press, a power lifting cage (nice feature to have), maybe a squat rack. I didn&#039;t see the dressing area but it didn&#039;t look large. The fellow (owner? Asian guy with muscles) seemed very nice, and no-nonsense. I can&#039;t remember the prices, but I&#039;ll guess that it was something like 199 or 249 for a whole year (cheap). I went during a busy time (8 pm?) and the gym was somewhat crowded, like every gym at that time, but definitely not unreasonable at all. I believe they are open until 11 pm or midnight during the week. <br /><br />All in all, does not look fantastic, but if you live near 72nd and Northern Blvd. and don&#039;t want to drive to a gym or take the subway, then it&#039;s a good option. Going here makes a lot more sense than walking to Executive Fitness on Roosevelt Ave. It&#039;s smaller than Executive Fitness (EF has a whole separate aerobics room) but looks less crowded during peak hours, and not as beat-up and rusty like Executive Fitness. <br /><br />Executive Fitness WAS a 24 hour gym Mon-Thurs (if the above poster is correct they changed their hours) which was a nice feature... if they changed it, too bad.

				I was a member of United Fitness a couple of years ago.&nbsp; Not a bad place for the money it cost, but the store front set up threw me off.&nbsp; They had an air conditioner which was located at the back of the gym, where all the weights were.&nbsp; The folks using the treadmills wanted the a/c on full blast so they could be cool, but that would make the weight area freezing, which was a major downer.&nbsp; But the place was clean and the guys at the front were always nice.&nbsp; If you want a low key place at low cost to do the treadmills and some light lifting, then its a good place.<br /><br />I&#039;m going for the 7 day trial membership at Ultimate Fitness to see how that works out.&nbsp; Hopefully they have indoor bike parking.

				For the last year I&#039;ve been going to Urban Jungle, on 72nd Street, just south of Queens Blvd. It&#039;s a (friendly) boot-camp style that also does cardio boxing, blade defense courses for women, Atienza (Filipino) and Muai Thai martial arts - it&#039;s been my best experience ever at any fitness facility in NYC. I don&#039;t do the martial arts but I&#039;ve really enjoyed the boot camps. I started in the evenings after work, but have since switched to mornings before work. I don&#039;t have a car, so I either run (it&#039;s a 1.3 mile run from my apt - a perfect warm up) or bike there, but there is easy parking there. http://www.trainurbanjungle.com/<br /><br />

				It looks like all the &quot;fitness&quot; pictures on the Urban Jungle website are taken outdoors, as if they conduct their classes in a park. (The martial arts classes photos were taken indoors). Do they have weightlifting equipment there?<br /><br />If you are willing to go as far as Queens Blvd, there is a Bally&#039;s on Queens Blvd. and approx. 75th (reviews don&#039;t seem positive) and also Big Six Fitness on Queens Blvd. and approx. 61st (which is a great gym, IMO -- I checked it out a few months ago -- but I think it&#039;s too far for most people to walk from Jackson Heights).<br /><br />It seems like Jackson Heights remains ripe for picking, for a nice gym that caters to people who want weights and cardio machines. It doesn&#039;t have to be a huge complex with a pool and spa facilities, IMO. For one thing, those memberships are two or three times more expensive. The start-up costs on that would be enormous, and the amount of land required would add to the difficulty. IMO, a less-fancy gym would be fine, and actually preferable.

				I just got a promo card for Retro Fitness on Northern Boulevard &amp; Broadway (near the Best Buy). It says Astoria, but it&#039;s a pretty short drive/bus ride from JH. Has anybody been to it yet? For $20/month, it sounds like a great deal. I joined CrossFit in Astoria but since I don&#039;t have a car and the hours don&#039;t really work for me, I am back on the search.

				Brook Lyn, <br />If you liked CrossFit, but Astoria didn&#039;t work for you, give CrossFit LIC a look. My husband and I joined about a month ago. It is a short walk from the E/M station at 23rd/Court Sq., and they have a good selection of early morning and evening/night classes. They moved into the space a few months ago, so there are still some things that need work, but the coaches are top notch and it&#039;s a great environment to get a good work-out. Their website is www.crossfitlic.com. Free intro classes are on Saturdays at 11 or 11:30.<br />

				Thanks Erica. Crossfit LIC is actually even farther than the Astoria location. If I had a car, I&#039;d definitely go to either of them, but it&#039;s a bit of a hike on the bike, and coming from 81&amp; 34th, it will take a while to get to on the train as well. I work in the Lefrak/Corona area, and there aren&#039;t any decent options out there within walking distance either. <br /><br />It&#039;s crazy that Astoria has sooooo many gyms of varying price ranges and quality, many within walking distance of each other. JH seems to only have EFN Zone and that place on Northern in the 70s :-(. I also noticed that Bayside has 2 Crossfits within a couple blocks of each other. How can we get something (I&#039;d take a decent Planet Fitness or NYSC) in this area?

				considering the amount of space needed for a real gym, northern boulevard is the only really viable option -- and the one negative about that is the relative remoteness. i live on 35th avenue and rarely go to northern unless i have a destination appointment or a need to patronize a place -- d&#039;espana comes to mind. it&#039;s more of a car street, where roosevelt -- which has fewer large spaces -- is more of a foot traffic street.<br /><br />not saying i wouldn&#039;t like a pleasant place to work out, just that the logistics are tough right around here.

				Retro seems to offer one or 2 classes/day either at 7 and/or 8pm if I remember correctly. I saw Zumba and Kickboxing on the schedule, but I don&#039;t remember if they offer anything else, since I wasn&#039;t really looking for other classes. I wish there was something early in the morning around 6:00 or 6:30, but I&#039;ll take what I can get. I&#039;m going to try out one or two of the classes this week. <br /><br />The locker room is clean and bright and doesn&#039;t seem like it gets much use. The main users are probably local residents who walk/drive/bike in. I didn&#039;t look for towels, so I&#039;m not sure they offer them. I&#039;ll have to check the next time I go. I signed up for a 1 day pass online but they gave me a 3 day pass when I went in. The staff was pretty friendly. For $20/month you could do worse.

				I was about to sign up for RetroFit and decided against it. I didn&#039;t like the fine print on their contract. Sixty days notice of cancellation is a bit excessive, as most places only require 30, and you can only cancel AFTER one year unless you&#039;ve died, moved more than 25mi away or have a doctor&#039;s note. <br /><br />In also find it annoying that they have a $99 initiation fee AND a $20 processing fee if you&#039;re using a credit card AND an annual fee of $29 in addition to your dues. The annual fee is ONLY disclosed in the fine print. Averaged out over a year, this brings your total to roughly $31, which is still cheap, but I&#039;ve got a thing about places that charge these extra/hidden fees. <br /><br />You could pay in full ahead of time, but they have language that it may be &quot;financially risky&quot; to do so. Maybe that&#039;s just overlawyering on their part, but I have never seen that in any other gym contract I&#039;ve signed. <br /><br />After reading reviews for other branches on Yelp, it seems that most people don&#039;t read the fine print and then get surprised and aggravated by these terms when they need to cancel. It&#039;s still cheap, but I&#039;ll pass. <br /><br />Back on the search...

				FYI - NYSC has similar contract rules.&nbsp; The one saving grace was that I was able to get the initiation fee waived.&nbsp; They do have a $24 promotion again on Groupon right now for one month.&nbsp; That&#039;s how they got me, lol.&nbsp; Slick bastards.&nbsp; But there are so few options in this area that I just signed up.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t regretted it, since I haven&#039;t found anything better.&nbsp; And their Saturday zumba class rocks.

				I would prefer to pay upfront for 6 months (or a year) rather than hand my credit card over, and authorize monthly payments. These automatic payments can be hard to stop (lots of horror stories about big franchises taking additional months to cancel a membership, or charging a cancellation fee, etc). If I join a gym, I&#039;m going to exercise, period. I am certain that a year from now, I&#039;ll still want a gym. So paying upfront is only a risk if the gym sucks, or goes out of business. I can usually tell if the gym is no good (and I can tolerate a crummy place, if there are no other choices). Health clubs are a big source of consumer fraud (pre-sales but then the gym never opens, etc) so there are laws that are somewhat protective. If the facility is big, it&#039;s unlikely they will go out of business, but these gyms seem to be the type that are hard to cancel (look at reviews on Yelp or Google for horror stories). So, I prefer paying upfront.<br /><br />Since you guys are talking about going outside of Jackson Heights, I liked the gym called Phyzique in Woodside (I only visited). Not huge but medium-large, clean, good selection of machines and free weights, near the 7 train 52nd street station (located on 50th street just above Roosevelt). I don&#039;t recall if they have a separate room for aerobics (I mainly use the free weights)&nbsp; -- sorry about that, aerobics folks. Maybe call to ask. Worth a visit in-person. They have treadmills, bikes and steppers if I recall. Nice facility. I was there in the afternoon (it was quiet) but like every gym, I suppose it gets busy between 6 and 9pm.<br />http://phyzique4life.com/ (http://phyzique4life.com/)<br /><br />I also liked Big 6 Gym in Woodside (on Queens Blvd) which is large, very well-equipped, and they do have aerobics classes. Again, I only visited during the daytime. You can expect an after-work rush. Formerly a Golds Gym or maybe World Gym (?). It&#039;s in the Big 6 mall.<br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-six-fitness-woodside (http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-six-fitness-woodside)<br /><br />(I didn&#039;t want to promote these gyms too much, because they are not within the confines of JH. But since I see other people mentioning Sunnyside and Astoria, I thought I would mention them again.)<br /><br />I want to move to the area, and a good gym within walking distance is non-negotiable, so I&#039;ve been visiting different facilities to see what they offer. It&#039;s a definite drawback that JH doesn&#039;t have more. I&#039;ll check out Retro Fitness at some point soon!

				Many online reports that Retro Fitness makes it difficult to cancel a membership (see links listed in one of the posts here):<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/retro-fitness-brooklyn (http://www.yelp.com/biz/retro-fitness-brooklyn)<br /><br />Basically, they continue to charge you while they drag their feet to cancel your membership. This seems to be standard with these big chains like Golds and World Gym which want your credit card info upfront for automatic payments. Also, if the gym stops being profitable they can let services slide, or even shut down. I&#039;m guessing that they are franchises, and just like there can be a &quot;bad&quot; Subway Sandwiches shop, the franchise logo doesn&#039;t guarantee satisfaction. Just be careful, that&#039;s all I&#039;m saying. <br /><br />I also noticed that the Retro Fitness is most definitely in Astoria. Much closer to Steinway St. than Roosevelt Ave. <br /><br />The search continues.
