					Hello Everyone, <br />I&#039;d just like to publicly post a big thank you to NYC Native.&nbsp; Everyone sees the construction work he does online, as well as his funny messages, but for those who don&#039;t know him personally, I can attest that he is a very stand up individual.&nbsp; I am the one with the nightmare kitchen pics he posted awhile back.&nbsp; <br /><br />My kitchen was a big pain in the butt, and when it didn&#039;t go as easily as planned, it created a huge mess and one part didn&#039;t end up exactly I planned.&nbsp; I was upset, but there wasn&#039;t really anything I could do about it.&nbsp; It still looks great, but it&#039;s not exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; He knew this and apologized many times, but there wasn&#039;t anything that could be done at that point.<br /><br />So, this year I decided to attack my bathroom myself.&nbsp; I posted a question about the floor and didn&#039;t get a lot of responses.&nbsp; I really needed a tile saw, but had never used one myself, and wasn&#039;t very comfortable with the idea.&nbsp; 14 months after my kitchen was completed, I contacted him asking if he knew of any stores I could bring tiles to and get them cut because home depot and lowes wouldn&#039;t do it.&nbsp; I was shocked when he offered to send one of his guys to come over to cut and lay my tile for me.&nbsp; It was really unbelieveable and one of the nicest things I&#039;ve ever heard of a contractor doing.&nbsp; He said he owed me because of the problem with my kitchen.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t expecting anything, but now my floor looks fantastic.&nbsp; It was really above and beyond anything I could have asked for.&nbsp; And for all you looking to do renovations to your apartments, I would highly recommend giving him a call.&nbsp; He&#039;ll explain everything and go out of his way so you understand the whole process.&nbsp; &nbsp;You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks Luis, I really owe you one!<br />Joe

					I decided to post this in a different thread because I&#039;ve found a lot of conflicting info on this specific subject alone.&nbsp; To the people that have had their bathrooms remodeled... how difficult was the floor to do?&nbsp; I&#039;ve got the normal small pink and blue tiles and the grout around them is crumbling and the tiles are loose.&nbsp; Last night I pulled some up and discovered that I could basically demo the whole floor with my bare hands!&nbsp; Its crumbling all around very easily.<br /><br />After a lot of research, I found (at least I think so) that this material is gypcrete.&nbsp; All the info i have seen says to remove it and start over.&nbsp; This is where my question comes in...<br /><br />If you remove the gypcrete, vacuum, and clean the area, there is a metal mesh at the bottom.&nbsp; The floor is also not level with small humps, and is about 1.5 inches shorter.&nbsp; How have you or your contractors gone about laying a new floor?&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m trying to figure this out before I either attempt it myself or hire someone to do it.&nbsp; In my mind it makes sense to pour on a floor leveling compund, then thinset, then screw down the hardie backerboard, and then more thinset and tile.&nbsp; There are a lot of opinions on this on the interwebs, so i wanted to see what some locals have seen on their own projects.<br /><br />If this is totally wrong, or right, i&#039;d love it if someone could let me know.&nbsp; Thanks guys!

					Hey guys and gals... <br />I have a very strong, metal metro shelving unit with several shelves and racking to hang items.&nbsp; It is in perfect condition and is virtually indestructible.&nbsp; Really good for someone that doesn&#039;t have any counters in their kitchen.&nbsp; I have a large piece of marble that fits right on top of it that i used for years as my countertop.&nbsp; I can sell the metroshelving unit for $100, and the marble top for $120.&nbsp; I&#039;m negotiable if you want both.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also have a racheting reclining la-z-boy rocker in good shape.&nbsp; It has leather and upholstery covering.&nbsp; There is a small rip from my movers, but other than that, it&#039;s a great chair.&nbsp; In fact, my friends are gonna be really angry when i get rid of it because they&#039;re always fighting over who gets to sit there!&nbsp; I just got a new one, and thats why i&#039;m selling it.&nbsp; The back is removable for easy transport.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t very heavy either.&nbsp; I&#039;m selling this for $150.&nbsp; My new one just cost me $1100, so I think that&#039;s pretty fair, considering it&#039;s very comfortable and in pretty good shape.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like I said, everything is in good shape.&nbsp; The metroshelves come apart, but are still heavy.&nbsp; I can help you carry the pieces down.&nbsp; I can also help with the chair, eventhough it&#039;s not too heavy.&nbsp; My building has an elevator which makes it easy. <br /><br />If you&#039;re interested in either or both of the pieces, send me an email at <a href="mailto:py180@hotmail.com" class="bbc_email">py180@hotmail.com</a> or call me at (347)255-7268.&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides going to the gym, I should be available most of the day saturday or sunday for you to check it out.&nbsp; I&#039;ve attached a pic of the shelves, but I still need to take a pic of the chair.&nbsp; Thanks, and I hope to hear from you!<br />Joe<br />

					We had the heat turned on last weekend.&nbsp; Maybe our heater is on turbo mode, because I had to open the windows and turn on the fan.&nbsp; I felt like i was suffocating on sunday.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it will get better once it gets colder outside.

					I used flat rate movers as well.&nbsp; They were right on time, and really fast.&nbsp; They did break 3 pieces of furniture (ripped into a leather recliner, broke legs off a table, and broke corner of wood side table) and a picture frame.&nbsp; Thank God I opted for the additional insurance they offered for $50 extra, because I ended up having $875 in claims, which they paid after an arduous insurance/ claims process.&nbsp; Flat rate is not that cheap, but they are fast and pretty well organized.&nbsp; I&#039;d definitely opt for the additional insurance, though.&nbsp;

					Weekends are best for me.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to go out and find some new places to eat.&nbsp; We could also entertain the idea of a &quot;dinner club&quot; type thing if anyone is interested.&nbsp; We&#039;d take turns going to each other&#039;s places and everyone cooks something different, but all associated with a theme.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how people woul react to strangers being in their homes, but if there would be a small recurring group, it could be fun.&nbsp; As soon as my kitchen gets renovated, i&#039;ll have everyone over, lol!&nbsp; Until then, lets go out and find some good grub.

					The 2 kids I saw running out of the building were definitely not special needs.&nbsp; Who knows what the problem was.&nbsp; All i can say is, to all you parents out there, please try to get your kids to the bus stop on time.&nbsp; Some of us have to get to work unfortunately! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cry.gif" alt="&#58;&#039;&#40;" title="Cry" class="smiley" />

					Ok, so this morning (and many mornings like it) I drive to work, and often times I get stuck behind a school bus stopped on 34th ave.&nbsp; Today we all patiently waited for 12 minutes before a kid emerged from a building and boarded the bus.&nbsp; Is it just me, or is that crazy!&nbsp; When I was growing up, you had to be out waiting for the bus, because if you weren&#039;t there, the bus would do a halfway rolling stop, and then move swiftly along.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s different in this neighborhood and someone can enlighten me as to why buses are allowed to block traffic on the narrowest streets in the city waiting for kids who only have to walk 15 feet from their front doors to catch it.&nbsp; I have no problem stopping when the red lights are flashing and the kids are getting on.&nbsp; But, there is no reason why the bus should be waiting there for 12 minutes holding up everyone who has to get to work, and have no way of going around it.&nbsp; Needless to say, I am a bit frustrated. :tickedoff:
