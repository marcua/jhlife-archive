				I don&#039;t know Riko but I wil mention that we are ardent El Pollo Inka loyalists. The food is better and cheaper than Pio Pio, and the atmosphere far more relaxed. A sleeper hit: the salmon with fresh spinach. Incredible value and handy if you are with someone who won&#039;t each chicken.

				What is Riko? Is it El Rico Tinto maybe? I&#039;m glad to hear about Pollo Inka--I&#039;ll look them up. Just tried Pollos a la Brasa Mario last week, and didn&#039;t like the chicken at all. The &quot;best&quot; roasted chicken place that was recommended to us when we moved here 9 years ago was on Roosevelt, but it is gone now--I don&#039;t even remember the name, it was takeout only I think.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s good for a business to be showing as closed on Google, so when I see that info, and I know for a fact it&#039;s open, I do try to make the report.<br /><br />I suggest just calling the restaurant to ask. Their Yelp page shows that in late May, they posted an update to say they were now open for takeout and delivery.<br /><br />https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-pollo-inka-peru-jackson-heights

				My summary would be<br /><br />Riko-best sauces, good all around<br />Pio Pio-love the saffron rice, good all around<br />El Pollo Inka- best chicken , garlic sauce is good but rice is usually undercooked<br />El Casa del Pollo-good ribs, best beans, sauce is underwhelming (taste and quantity)<br />Warique-love the combo with fried rice and plantains, spiciest sauce, also great

				Thanks for the mini review JH Foodie! Tried Warique last night and we were very pleased. Loved the chicken and green sauce. We also ordered maduros, delicious, the salsa criolla, very good, and a fish filet with rice and fried yuca. The rice was supposed to be yellow rice, but they sent white, and I don&#039;t understand the appeal of yuca--but overall we will definitely order again. And now I want to try the others on your list--already have tried Pio Pio and was looking for other options. Riko and El Pollo Inka next. (In the time of covid, what to have for dinner takes on outsized importance.)

				FYI--though Doordash said El Pollo Inka Peru would deliver to us, it also said they were closed temporarily. But when I called, they are open and they do deliver, but when I told her my address she said no, I&#039;m too far away. I&#039;m on 76 St between 35th and 37th. Surprised--I think she said they only deliver within 10 blocks. Again--surprised!

				My decision: Warique it is! Just ordered a second time. It was very good and not very expensive, they deliver to my address...yay! Riko&#039;s had a lot of very negative reviews--so much so, I didn&#039;t want to even try it.

				Yes, indeed, I can count! I meant I was surprised that they have a 10-block limit for delivery. Seems like a small delivery area and we are able to get deliveries from lots of places further away. Especially now when delivery is the name of the game.

They are separate. The restaurant may have its own delivery people who operate in a certain area while Doordash has drivers who may deliver for multiple restaurants. If you want to support a particular restaurant, you&#039;re better off ordering from them directly since they won&#039;t have to split their profit with Doordash. If you want to use an app, you may need to have several different apps to cover all the local restaurants, but you can&#039;t beat the convenience.

				In the case of El Pollo Inka Peru, though, DoorDash seems to be their only online option for delivery, but DoorDash was saying they were closed, which is not the case. Maybe if DoorDash ever delivers for them again, they would deliver further? But when I called to try and order directly from them, they said they would not deliver to 76th St, it was too far. I do go to individual restaurant&#039;s own apps or websites to order when it is possible, but I don&#039;t think El Pollo Inka Peru has an app or website option...and anyway they have the 10-block limit.<br /><br />As it happens we did order from Warique last night--and for the first time had a problem. We ordered through Seamless and ten minutes past the time Seamless said the food would arrive, Warique called to apologize and tell us they had a system outage and only just then did they get our order. And do we still want it? <br /><br />We said yes, and they said it would take 30 minutes. After 45 minutes-1 hour (and this is a real problem for us as my spouse is diabetic and needs to eat when blood sugar is falling and it was already very late for him) they still had not arrived and we tried to call them. Phone not working. We finally contacted Seamless who also tried calling and found the phone not working. Seamless refunded our money--and shortly after the food arrived.<br /><br />I tried to reverse the refund via Seamless twice, and they said it&#039;s not possible to reverse a refund. So I plan to go over to the restaurant later and pay them. I&#039;m sure there was an electrical or internet outage that caused this, and not their fault, but it was very frustrating to not be able to reach them by phone at all, and not know for sure if they would ever arrive. Their food is great and well priced, so I still recommend. Just wish that if they have internet phone they&#039;d cover their bases and have a mobile phone as well, so customers can reach them.

				Yeah, I am a well-informed New Yorker, and I know all about the apps and the restaurants and the issues. However, they are not all set up for ordering directly--if they were, why would they remain on the other platforms? And isn&#039;t it better for them to have the business however they get it? We order A LOT. <br /><br />In the case of Warique --their phone was in fact not in service, so how would we order from them if not online? We are older people who are not going to walk all the way to them from our apartment. And when ordering online, it&#039;s cashless, no contact, and safer for us. We remain healthy, hungry customers who continue to spend money ordering from them.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that on the whole better for them as well as for us? Don&#039;t let the perfect get in the way of the good.

				Well it&#039;s different strokes for different folks, isn&#039;t it? We tried Pollos Marios and thought the chicken was tasteless and very disappointing. Have now ordered the roasted chicken from Warique twice and loved it both times. Juicy and tasty! Maybe it&#039;s the salt that we like, but it was really delicious, as was everything else we tried--rice, beans, maduros--except for the fish filet dish, which was very plain. Have not ordered from Pio Pio in years, maybe we&#039;ll try that again for a better comparison. And once it&#039;s not so very hot, maybe I will walk up to El Pollo Inka Peru sometime, since we can&#039;t get delivery from them.
