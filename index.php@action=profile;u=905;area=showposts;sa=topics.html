					I have the air conditioner on.&nbsp; That&#039;s because we get heat every day.&nbsp; We had major work done to the tune of<br />$3,750,000.&nbsp; When the hurricane Irene arrived 92 apartments have serious water damage and mold.&nbsp; We get heat because the owners won&#039;t purchase portable heaters since they have no money so were spending thousands on fuel.&nbsp; <br /><br />I sold my apartment in one day to my Nephew for $150,000. If anyone is planning to purchase here wait at least 6 months.&nbsp; All three buildings are fabulous and people here are nice.&nbsp; This is ultra quality especially 3525 77th St.&nbsp; Prices are coming down so wait even one year.&nbsp; Lobby and Halls here are Waldorf Astoria.&nbsp; I strongly recommend apartments facing Garden.&nbsp; The Staff is incredible and so is the Board of Directors and a great Managing Agent.&nbsp; Our staff is just as good as any fine building in Manhattan.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another favorite is all three Belvedere&#039;s.&nbsp; Just as good and much lower maintenance.&nbsp; I pay $725, Belvedere is $525.&nbsp; Very low Mortgage.&nbsp; They should pay it off and convert to Condominiums and values would almost double.&nbsp; The building that I really like is Terrace View.&nbsp; They have same maint but have 24 hour Doorman, Parking and a Gym and a fabulous area.<br /><br />

					I lived in Manhattan for 32 years before arriving in JH&#039;s in June 2001.&nbsp; In Manhattan we had a very large Indian population who lived in the very best Buildings.&nbsp; They&#039;re all highly educated and speak with a&nbsp; British accent.&nbsp; I came here and they were good quality but not on Manhattan level.&nbsp; I came here to invest in Real Estate and know many Indian investors who became friends.&nbsp; They own many homes in JH&#039;s and rent mostly to Indians.&nbsp; They informed me that the Indians who are coming are poor, no education and completely illiterate.&nbsp; They are coming for the Food Stamps and Health Care.&nbsp; This investor is purchasing many more homes to accomodate all that are coming.&nbsp; An entire family lives in the Livingroom and many others in the bedrooms and basements.&nbsp; Indian investor follow Indian Law.&nbsp; The poor have no health care in the villages so now they have Elmhurst General Hospital.&nbsp; I have many South American friends who are leaving JH&#039;s for other Queens communities and are selling to Indians.&nbsp; This has all just beginning and thousands will be arriving.&nbsp; In Staten Island where family lives up until now they were Christian Indians.&nbsp; No more.&nbsp; They now have Hindu Temples but not the Southern Part of SI where the Mafia lives.&nbsp; JH&#039;s will be radically changing according to these Indian Investors who are bringing them here and paying the air fare.<br /><br />I&#039;m moving back to Manhattan early next year.&nbsp; I can&#039;t sell so I&#039;m using my apartment to run a business.&nbsp; It will be an office.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know many Realtors in JH&#039;s.&nbsp; Business is way off.&nbsp; Lots of listing but not a lot of buying.&nbsp; Some are moving to Brooklyn where you have buyers.&nbsp; The professionals in Astoria where I have a young nephew are moving to Manhattan where rents have dropped significantly.&nbsp; My nephews is moving back to Lincoln Towers.&nbsp; He sold his apartment in 2006 for $650,000 and is purchasing it back for $300,000.&nbsp; The cooperative Market on the upper East Side is down 40% from the peak 2006 and going much lower.&nbsp; I began real estate in Manhattan in 1980 so I know the Market.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m passing on the info that they&#039;re giving me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t own anything other than this one bedroom and I&#039;m now in a different business.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping its not as bad as they predict.&nbsp; The Indians are not criminal in any way.&nbsp; Many will be employees in restaurants and other businesses all over the City but they like Queens.&nbsp; They will work for $5 and hour.&nbsp; The minimum wage is $10.50 but they don&#039;t follow our Law.&nbsp; <br /><br />I like JH&#039;s so I will be here 5 days a week.&nbsp; I&#039;ve met an incredible amount of wonderful people so I can&#039;t leave entirely.&nbsp; <br />I like JH&#039;s people better than Manhattan residents.&nbsp; This has been an incredible 10 years.&nbsp;

					I&#039;m looking to have someone steam clean the bathroom tiles (both floor and wall) and clean the hardwood floors. This company does both. They have a deep cleaning process that removes dirt and residue safely from the floors.&nbsp; I did a search and found a company in Long Island that also services Queens called Stanley Steemer.&nbsp; I do remember seeing the truck once in JH&#039;s.&nbsp; Has anyone used this company with success.&nbsp; I&#039;m also open to suggestion for other firms.&nbsp; Thank You.&nbsp;

					The former Family Restaurant is now Himalayan Hut located at 75-18 37th Ave opposite Trade Fair.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very attractive sit down restaurant serving both Chinese and Desi Chinese.&nbsp; I ordered lunch take out of Fish Chilli with hot &amp; sour soup which is tonight&#039;s dinner for just $6.95.&nbsp; I just sampled it and it&#039;s very good.&nbsp; The $6.95 lunch has chicken, fish, beef and vegetable dishes.&nbsp; I quickly looked at the Desi Chinese eat in menu and it&#039;s very reasonable (shrimp dishes $10.95).&nbsp; It&#039;s owned by a very pleasant couple.&nbsp; They deliver.&nbsp; The take out menu just has Chinese dishes similar to the neighborhood take out places.&nbsp; I took home a lunch menu which has on one side Chinese and the other side Desi Chinese.&nbsp; They need a take out menu for Desi Chinese that&#039;s similar to the dine in menu.&nbsp; I mentioned this website to the owners.&nbsp;

					It looks like Gourmet Fantasy has a new owner.&nbsp; I walked by yesterday and noticed the for rent sign is down and the windows are covered with brown paper.&nbsp; It was being marketed as a Deli so it will be interesting to see what kind.&nbsp; It won&#039;t need much renovating so it should open soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

					I know someone from Manhattan who plans to make an offer on a unit at Terrace View located at 7910 34th&nbsp; Ave. &nbsp;This person called me and wanted an opinion of the building but I don&#039;t know anything about it either positive or negative. &nbsp;Would appreciate any comments regarding this building. &nbsp;Thank You. &nbsp;

					I just noticed this place today.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tiny Korean take out with no tables.&nbsp; Entree with rice is $6.&nbsp; Two Korean woman behind the counter with one cooking and the other taking care of customers.&nbsp; I noticed on the grill a very large Korean Pancakes being made for a customer that looked awesome.&nbsp; It&#039;s just one block from the 74th St subway so it should do a lot of evening business.&nbsp; It&#039;s located at 75-24 Broadway.&nbsp; The awning is Yogo To Go which was the former business.&nbsp; Opening this type of business makes sense.&nbsp; How much could the rent be for less than 100SF.&nbsp; I already have dinner plans so I won&#039;t order today but will tomorrow.&nbsp;

					On several occasions, a menu from Calle 48 Pescaderia located at 48-10 Broadway (close to Home Depot) is slipped under my door.&nbsp; Obviously, they&#039;re making deliveries to our building but I don&#039;t know who.&nbsp; They&#039;re at least 1 1/2 miles away so it surprises me thay would deliver this far.&nbsp; The menu is entirely Seafood and very extensive &amp; inexpensive.&nbsp; Has anyone been to or had food delivered from this restaurant?&nbsp; If I don&#039;t get any response, I may just place an order and hope for the best.&nbsp; They serve grilled, baked or steamed fish.&nbsp;

					I went to the Russian Deli on 76th St this morning and it was closed. &nbsp;They were evicted (once again) by the Marshall for not paying the rent. &nbsp;I was quite disappointed since I shopped at the store on a regular basis. &nbsp;I don&#039;t even want to think of what will replace this Deli. &nbsp;This plus the Polish Deli on 87th St closing is awful. &nbsp;

					It just opened at 37th Ave &amp; 72nd St.&nbsp; It&#039;s small with just two tables.&nbsp; Thai Soup $1.50, Samosa 3 for $1, 3 choices over white or fried rice $4.50 and they have spring rolls.&nbsp; I just brought home take out for tonight&#039;s dinner and the Thai Soup.&nbsp; I did a little sampling and it&#039;s good.&nbsp; The choices are chickens dishes and vegetable dishes. No seafood or beef.&nbsp; The 3 choices portions are not large like in Flushing where they do a huge volume and can give large portions.&nbsp;
