			There is a cat behind my building -- could be a stray or a pet (not sure).&nbsp; Looks like he/she has a broken rear leg.&nbsp; Any suggestions as to an animal rescue I can contact about this?&nbsp; I called one animal rescue and was directed to the Mayor&#039;s Alliance for NYC Animals website. From there, I found the number for the city&#039;s Animal Care Center.&nbsp; I&#039;ve left a voicemail message but haven&#039;t heard back yet.

			Hi,<br />Do you know if the cat is feral or friendly?&nbsp; You could try Bobbi and the Strays.&nbsp; They are a rescue group.&nbsp; Animal Care and Control is a kill shelter so the cat will most probably just be euthanized.&nbsp; Where are you located?<br />I will ask around to see if there is anyone else<br />Can you feed him because he most probably cannot go hunting for food.

			Is the back of your building accessible from the street? Can you take a picture of the cat and post the address? Advocat rescue might be able to help. I can&#039;t seem to find a number for them but they have a website and facebook page.
