					<br />In response to your question:<br /><br />I think that the meeting went quite well!<br /><br />there were about ten of us (all local artists).<br /><br />Cecilia (the Y Gallery director) gave an interesting talk about the gallery, where she described her vision, her artists, her choices to open a space in JH and some of her future plans.&nbsp; We all enjoyed her original and non compromising artistic direction, her optimism and resourcefulness. <br /><br />Dulce Pinzon gave an intriguing presentation of her artwork (photographs), some of the concepts behind her projects and the process that lead to them. Hearing about her process and how she collaborates with her subjects gave us an even more expanded view about her photography.<br /><br />If you want to learn more about her work, please do check out her web site listed in the above email.<br /><br />At the end of our meeting we touched briefly on the subject of real estate and our search for studio space.&nbsp; That conversation was not very conclusive.&nbsp; we need to dedicate more time to it next meeting.<br /><br />We are planning on meeting next time on a weekend, so more people can attend. It was nice to have an intimate group, but it will be also amazing to join forces with more artists.&nbsp; Everyone who showed up expressed their interest in coming to more meetings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please keep spreading the word!!!

					JHâ€™s MIDSUMMER HAILED IN<br />SHOW BUSINESS WEEKLY<br />FINAL WEEK!!!<br /><br />From the Review...<br />â€œI stepped into the theater and was swallowed wholly by the world of the<br />play, and was shaken only by violent fits of laughter.<br />The production&#039;s modern take proves once and for all that Shakespeare&#039;s<br />words are compelling even when his characters are rapping...this<br />production pulls Shakespeare&#039;s timeless themes into real life, but does it<br />without losing the surrealism of A Midsummer Night. The light design<br />accentuates the magical quality of a play in which most characters think<br />they are merely dreaming...The combination of one of Shakespeare&#039;s<br />funniest works, a fresh cast and Kristin Skye Hoffman&#039;s direction makes<br />this A Midsummer Night well worth a trip to Queens.â€<br />A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream<br />COMDEY by William Shakespeare<br /><br /><br />FINAL WEEK!!!<br />Thursday â€“ SOLD OUT<br />Friday â€“ Saturday 8pm<br />Saturday Matinee 3pm<br />Professional Production<br />inside the Garden School<br />33-16 79th Street near Northern Blvd<br />TIX at the door<br />Or at Espresso 77 (35-57 77th Street) or <a href="http://www.SmartTix.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.SmartTix.com</a>.<br /><a href="http://www.QueensGardenStage.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.QueensGardenStage.org</a> â€“ 718-874-9431<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

					Hello Jackson Heights artists,<br />&gt;<br />&gt;For our second meeting we have prepared a DELICIOS evening for you!<br />&gt;We will meet at the Y Gallery and Cecilia, the gallery director will give us<br />&gt;a presentation about the gallery, her mission and artistic vision.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;One of the gallery artists, CULCE PINZON, (A NYFA recipient, an artist who<br />&gt;has been receiving a lot of media coverage in the past few years, please see<br />&gt;more info below) Will give us a presentation of her work and will be open to<br />&gt;answer questions.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;The meeting will be from 6:00-7:30.&nbsp; We hope that you will come and take<br />&gt;full advantage of this wonderful opportunity.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Do become a part of this expanding group of local artists! Let&#039;s make this<br />&gt;community an ARTS community!<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Y Gallery <br />&gt;32-70 85th Street (corner with Northern Boulevard)<br />&gt;Jackson Heights - Queens,<br />&gt;New York 11370-2012<br />&gt;Telephone<br />&gt;(718) 565 6285<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Please check out the artist DULCE PINZON on line at: <a href="http://www.dulcepinzon.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.dulcepinzon.com</a><br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Dulce PinzÃ³n was born in Mexico City in 1974. She studied Mass Media<br />&gt;Communications at the Universidad de Las Americas in Puebla Mexico and<br />&gt;Photography at Indiana University in Pennsylvania. In 1995 she moved to New<br />&gt;York where she studied at The International Center of Photography.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;As a young Mexican artist living in the US, Dulce soon found new inspiration<br />&gt;for her photography in feelings of nostalgia, questions of identity, and<br />&gt;political and cultural frustrations. In her black and white series Â³Viviendo<br />&gt;en el GabachoÂ² (a Mexican colloquialism for living in the US) she<br />&gt;illustrates the dualistic phenomenon of the integration of the Mexican<br />&gt;immigrant into the New York landscape.<br />&gt;This concept of dualism was further developed when she used nostalgic<br />&gt;iconograpic images from a Mexican card game projected over the naked bodies<br />&gt;of her New York friends and loved ones in Â³LoteriaÂ². Â³MultiracialÂ² portrayed<br />&gt;subjects of multiracial heritage against primary color backgrounds, exposing<br />&gt;the frailty of our concepts of race. Â³The Real Story of the superheroesÂ²<br />&gt;comes full circle to reintroduce the Mexican immigrant in New York in a<br />&gt;satirical documentary style featuring ordinary men and women in their work<br />&gt;environment donning superhero garb, thus raising questions of both our<br />&gt;definition of heroism and our ignorance of and indifference to the workforce<br />&gt;that fuels our ever-consuming economy.<br />&gt;In her latest project Â³People I likeÂ² she does studio portraits of divas,<br />&gt;rock stars, party goers, drama queens and artists, people that fascinate<br />&gt;her; all of them Latinos. They are part of what she believes to be a<br />&gt;breakthrough in the Latino cultural scene of New York City.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Her work has been exhibited in the Montclair Art Museum [2007], New Jersey;<br />&gt;The Central Library of Brooklyn [2007]; S-files of El Museo del Barrio<br />&gt;[2007], New York; Queens Museum of Art [2006], New York; Museum of the City<br />&gt;of New York [2006]; The International Center of Photography [2003], New<br />&gt;York.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Her work has been published and collected internationally. In 2001 her<br />&gt;photos were used for the cover of a publication of Howard ZinnÂ¹s book Â³A<br />&gt;PeopleÂ¹s History of the United StatesÂ². In 2002 Dulce won the prestigious<br />&gt;Jovenes Creadores grant in Mexico for her work. In 2006 she won an Honorific<br />&gt;Mention in the Santa Fe project competition and she won the 12th edition of<br />&gt;the Mexican Biennial of El Centro de La Imagen. Dulce was a 2006 fellow in<br />&gt;Photography from the New York Foundation for the Arts and is now<br />&gt;participating in the 2007 fall session of the Bronx MuseumÂ¹s AIM program.<br />&gt;She is currently a Ford Foundation fellow and lives in Brooklyn New York.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;<br />

					<br />Hello folks!<br /><br />So the meeting went quite well although it was a bit chaotic towards the end with my kids (sorry). Let&#039;s consider finding a solution for the toddlers/babies for next time (maybe an in-house sitter or a play corner or Sesame Street in a portable video).<br /><br />Here is what we discussed in brief:<br /><br /><br />We spoke bout the possibility of creating a special list serve and web site for JH artists where we can share info, exchange ideas and have links to personal sites.<br /><br />We will hold monthly meetings with guests speakers, presentations of our artworks and continue discussing different topics that are relevant to the community. <br /><br />We will put together a &quot;Space Committee&quot; that will be in charge of searching for a large commercial space (walking distance) where we can rent studios.<br /><br />We will keep everybody posted about up and coming events and our next steps.<br /><br />Thank you all, for showing up and believing in this idea!!!<br /><br />Good night,<br /><br />Deborah

					Hello folks!<br />&gt;<br />&gt;We were notified on Saturday that we are not be able to hold our meeting&nbsp; in the Garden School unless we pay a fee.&nbsp; I do not feel comfortable charging you a fee on our first meeting (or any meeting). Therefore, the location for our meeting may change.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;We are currently working on couple of solutions and trying to stick to our original schedule, which is Saturday, Sept 13 at 4:00PM.&nbsp; Please stay tuned to this message board and JH live for further information about the new location for the meeting.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Peace,<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Deborah

					<br /><br />Hello there, visual artists, writers, filmmakers and writers!<br /><br />Please do not forget that we will be meeting this Saturday at 4:00.&nbsp; The meeting place may change, so stay tuned to this message board! It will be an informal meeting in which we can discuss different possibilities and strategies to have a tight, well connected and vibrant arts community by making some improvements and using the resources we already have.<br /><br />One of the ideas that we thought about was to have a special presence on the internet, in a form of a blog, web site or a site similar to this one.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know who is the moderator, founder or &#039;manager&#039; of this list.&nbsp; I wanted to find out if it would be possible for us, JH artists, to have a special category on JH Live where we can run our own chats and have links to our web site.<br /><br />Can the moderator please reply to my personal e-mail?<br />It&#039;s: <a href="mailto:debwass@earthlink.net" class="bbc_email">debwass@earthlink.net</a> <br /><br />Many many thanks!<br />Looking forward to meeting you, creative people, on Saturday!

					Hello there, everybody!<br />I am so excite about all of your responses, and I am actually planning on recruiting one or two of you to work with me on the fast approaching event on Sept 13.<br />People have brought up many interesting ideas and points and many of you seem to be full of great initiatives and positive energy.<br />What I suggest is that you write down all the points that you would like to share and if necessary, do the research (about Queens Museum, art stores and studios) BEFORE the meeting. We are relaying on all of us to take initiative, as there is not yet a set committee or a consistent body of volunteers working on this (we will elect in the meeting).<br />I cannot respond to all of you personally via email,&nbsp; but I am sure you will get to voice your concerns and receive great feedbacks in the meeting.<br />Again, it will take place at the <strong>Garden School on September 13 in the afternoon 4-7</strong><br />I will surely keep you all posted!<br />

					Hello there!<br /><br />Thank you all for sending me some great suggestions for a meeting place.<br /><br />I am continuing my last e-mail in which I addressed artists in the neighborhood and suggested that we all meet soon to discussed couple of issues.<br /><br />After checking some options and speaking to couple of people it was decided that we will meet on Sept 13 at 4:00PM at the Garden School in the cafeteria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our event will take place between other two fun activities: Food tasting (1-4) and a performance of A Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream by the Queens Garden Stage (8-10), all of them will take place at the Garden School (we will send more details about the performance soon). <br /><br />I will work with some other artists on creating an agenda, so the meeting can run as smooth as possible. It will be an informal meeting, but there will be couple of issues we certainly want to nail down, to mention a few: Studio spaces, organizing art events and studio tours, creating a vibrant arts community in JH. <br /><br />Please start spreading the word and thinking about different issues and ideas that you would like to share in the meeting. If you personally know a curator, a gallerist or someone who works in the arts and lives in the neighborhood-invite them too.<br /><br />I guess I should be thinking a bout a moderator, someone who can take notes and a smart way to enter everyone&#039;s name into a computer date base on the spot. Once we know exactly what we need for the meeting, we will send an e-mail and see who wants to volunteer.<br /><br />This meeting is not only for visual artists.&nbsp; it is also for dancers, filmmakers, musicians and writers.&nbsp; <br /><br />AI would like to thank Alison Ostergaard, the founder of Queens Garden Stage for hooking us up with the space.<br /><br />I hope it will be the beginning of something really great!<br /><br />Peace,<br />Deborah
