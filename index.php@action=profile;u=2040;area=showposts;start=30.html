					I was walking my dog across the street from the park when suddenly about 10 undercover cop cars came SPEEDING DOWN the block - two were going soooooooooooooo fast maybe 120mph down the block. Me and another lady were shaking watching this with kids and cars stopped at the light on that block. The cars went so fast THEY JUMPED in the air because there is a speed bump, both cars went so high, that is how fast they were going and there were other cars waiting for the light to change, they almost hit those cars that and the cars that were pulled over and there are kids and people playing and walking around there. <br /><br />they were going down 77th and turned onto 76th street between 34th Ave and Northern Blvd. <br /><br />The cops and undercover cops BETTER SLOW THE HELL DOWN!!!, I don&#039;t care what is happening, they need to be reported!!!!, I wish I had taped them but I was in shock and shaking. <br />I don&#039;t know what was going on I looked in the news but didn&#039;t see anything, this happened around 5:45pm yesterday.

					If a dog or cat is RESCUE only at the ACC, then you must reach out to an approved rescue group that can pull the animal out for you. FIRST STEP is to FILL OUT AN APPLICATION ON THE RESCUE&#039;S WEBSITE AND SUBMIT ASAP = nothing can be done without a submitted application first - fill out with at least (3) rescue groups. <br /><br />To name a few<br />Rescue Dogs Rock NYC<br />Second Chance Rescue NYC<br />Rebound Hounds<br />Looking Glass Animal Rescue<br /><br />and many more<br />there is a list on the URGENTS PAGE TO THE RIGHT - I will post it here as well. <br /><a href="http://information.urgentpodr.org/dog-rescue-groups/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://information.urgentpodr.org/dog-rescue-groups/</a>

					The Bulldog survived but she beat him so bad he is blind now in his right eye and has a broken leg, hip, pelvis and 3 broken teeth. <br /><br />The ASPCA has it now and it will be never be harmed again. <br />I just hope he can overcome this....he is 11 months old. <br /><br />**********************<br /><br />as for the pitbull, I dont know if its alive, but i wish someone could find out who the owner is that left it there to bleed to death.

					My friend told me that about 5 weeks ago she heard a dog crying on her block. She lives on 73rd street and 30th Avenue (its the avenue that the Lexington School for the Deaf is on) ..she went out to investigate and the neighbors said that a man got out of his car&nbsp; and tied his dog to a pole and beat him with a hammer, left him bleeding and got back in the car and left. <br /><br />The neighbors were feeding the dog and trying to help him, he was a friendly dog.. they called the cops and the dog was taken away..I fear he was taken to the ACC which is a kill shelter and who knows if he is alive any longer. The bring all the dogs and cats there..its very sad. <br /><br />Does anyone know about this?

					if you call the ASPCA, they will not keep her, they transfer their dogs and cats to the ACC in Manhattan which is a kill shelter..so if someone can take her, it will save her life.
