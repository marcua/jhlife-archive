					I would also suggest people to talk to the super of Birchwood coop as well as kebab king.&nbsp; I actually spoke to the super a few weeks ago and he actually refused to clean up where homeless people hang since technically it is not the area that he is responsible.<br />So, I went to Kebab King and ask them to keep their store front clean.&nbsp; They said &quot;yes, I will do that later&quot; but they are not really responsive, either.&nbsp; Typically, any restaurant owner wouldn&#039;t want to have homeless hanging around in front of his/her restaurant because it will move customers away from the restaurant.&nbsp; But in the case of Kebab king, having litters and homeless in their <br />store front seems to be no problem.&nbsp; I tried to ask them to keep cleaning up their street but I failed.&nbsp; But if more people in the community ask, they may listen.

					We must stop Helen Sears from being re-elected.&nbsp; Look at the traffic and sanitation condition on 73rd and 74st.&nbsp; it is totally mess and the community has asked her to deal with the issue for a long time.&nbsp; She never ever tried to resolve the issue.&nbsp; We asked her to stop over development of the area by the merchants but she continued to favor the merchants over the residents.&nbsp; SHE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT RESIDENTS.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ms. Sears, what happened to the traffic study from 2007 summer???&nbsp; &nbsp; We are still waiting for the result to come out and act on the issue based on the study.

					Todd, if you are close to Eagle theatre, I would like to ask you a favor.&nbsp; The spot between Kebab king and the coop building on 73rd street is always filthy.&nbsp; Almost everyday there are coffee cups, foods from the street vendors thrown out on the street, which attracts rats.&nbsp; When I complained about the filth to Kebab King owner, he told me the spot belong to the Eagle theatre.&nbsp; I contacted the Eagle theatre to clean up their spot everyday and they seem to be not care about the filth at all.&nbsp; It is really disgusting.&nbsp; If you personally know the owner or workers there, could you please tell them to clean their spot everyday.&nbsp; I would appreciate that.&nbsp; Their filthness really gets to the point where it is dangerous to the community.

					We all knew that.&nbsp; But the truth is that the merchants really don&#039;t follow the law.&nbsp; I often call the sanitation dept. and they don&#039;t respond right away either.&nbsp; And even if the merchants sweep in front of their store at the beginning and end of every day, still it will be not enough considering the indians/bagladeshes habit of littering.&nbsp; those streets are just chaotic state.&nbsp; And it is vicious cycle because more garbage make people less care about environment and they tend to litter more.&nbsp; And more garbage on streets indicate the street is less controlled and it attracts more crime and homeless people, too.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why Community board or city council has not done anything about those streets.

					Thank you for your word, buddy.<br />the video and photo was shot on 73rd street.&nbsp; the first location was on a residential house.&nbsp; I have a big sympathy for the owner of the this house because I have seen people litter on this property all the time and the owner has to keep the area clean all the time.&nbsp; I am sure the owner of this building clean up the street much more often than the merchants.&nbsp; The day I took a picture was during the forth of july weekend.&nbsp; And I think the owner was away for a few days.&nbsp; And people on 73rd street kept littering. <br /><br />&nbsp;Todd, I found it very strange that you criticize the owner of the building instead of people who litter.&nbsp; Everyone who are living on 73rd street knows that owner of the building usually clean up many times a day and he should not be criticized and people are very sympathetic to the owner.&nbsp; I don&#039;t understand why you want to defend people who litter on 73rd and 74th streets?&nbsp; &nbsp; If people don&#039;t litter in the first place, there is no garbage.&nbsp; Can&#039;t you realize this?&nbsp; <br /><br />The second part of the video was on close to the corner of 37th road and 73rd street which is in front of Kebab king.&nbsp; This is the most polluted area on 73rd street.&nbsp; on top of the people who litter, kebab king owner don&#039;t clean up the street enough.&nbsp; And half part of this area should be cleaned up by Eagle theatre because according to Kebab king, that area belong to Eagle theatre.&nbsp; I have seen rats running around this area.&nbsp; <br /><br />I will take buddy&#039;s advice and I will shoot street signs to prove that this is happening on 73rd street and 74th street.

					Idea of having merchants to form BID for the community has been discussed many times.&nbsp; As far as I know, those merchants rejected to form BID <br />because they said it costs money..&nbsp;

					I have to agree 73rd street and 74th street being considered as a toilet of NYC from outsiders.&nbsp; I had several friends who are amazed how dirty the streets are.<br />The state of 73rd and 74th street may not be just Helen&#039;s fault. If people in that area respect the public and don&#039;t litter, then there is no garbage in the first place or merchants on the area respect the public and keep cleaning the their store front, then there will be no garbage, either.&nbsp; But for some reason, people who hang out around 73rd and 74th street don&#039;t respect the public.&nbsp; So now at least city can put some efforts to control those two streets.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know there are lot of old folks live in that area.&nbsp; And those old people are the one who are the victims of the Helen and merchants who are only interested in<br />making money.&nbsp; This is classic battle -business interests vs environment.&nbsp; And Helen are supporting the business interests because she received fundings from merchants.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is so sad..&nbsp; If merchants can afford to give money to Helen, they should form BID and hire people to clean their street constantly.<br /><br />

					Francis, thank you very much for your information.<br /><br />I am relatively new to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; So, the information like this is very helpful.&nbsp; I also learned that in the past there was a rally against Merchants in 74th street not taking responsibility of their street organized by JHBG.&nbsp; That tells you lot of people have been concerned about the 74th street.<br /><br />I would like to bring this up again at town hall meetings and community board 3 meetings.&nbsp; Could someone tell me how to do this?&nbsp; Is this a matter of making a call to the community board?

					I am sorry to bring this up again but nobody has not answered my question.<br /><br />Is there any way to have 74th Merchants form BID??&nbsp; 82nd st got BID, right?&nbsp; why not 74th st??<br /><br />or any other idea?&nbsp; I remember a guy from the sanitation department came to JHWA meeting, he said he was going to the store owners of 74th street to <br />raise the awareness.&nbsp; Did it happened?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					Will, thank you for your information about WJHA activities.&nbsp; I hope we get the service.&nbsp; By the way, since you seem to be familiar more with this issue, I am wondering if you have contacted 74th Street Merchants Organization about the garbage issue.&nbsp; And if you did, what was their stance or reaction to this issue?&nbsp; Have you invited them to one of your meetings?<br /><br /><br />
