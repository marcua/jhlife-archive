				Easier to type by starting another post.<br /><br />Some thoughts on named places.<br /><br />Both Lamstons and Woolworths had the very best Rubbermaid sections - something I used alot of back in the day. I remember that Woolworth&#039;s had a number of fish tanks on the bottom floor which my young son always liked to look at. I noticed the fish that day were floating (dead) and didn&#039;t want him to get upset. So I said to be very quiet that the fish were &#039;sleeping&#039;. He looks and me and says they aren&#039;t sleeping -there dead!! So much for protecting the innocence of a child.<br /><br />Dragon Seed was the best of the best - they had to this day the worlds greatest spare ribs.<br />Number 1 Chinese resturant had Sesame chicken whose like I will never taste again. Thye had a bullitin board listing the customers favorite dishes each week - the Sesame chicken was always on the top.<br />What a great deli Grafs was - Mike&#039;s was very good too.<br />Italian Farms which is still there had the best veal cutlets -today is it so hard to find veal cutlets due to their high cost.<br />Greco&#039;s is another place I really miss.<br />Cookie Express had the best brownies (Cafe 77 today has very good ones too) and the very best German chocolate cake. Everyone was so nice form the owner John - the baker and the counter girls -I still see Dotty with her red hair every once in awhile.<br /><br />There was a great Thai resturant on 90th street between Roosevelt and 37th ave which was my first introduction to Thai food.<br /><br />What a great trip down memory lane - the good part is that we still live in the best neighborhood in Queens!!!!
