				A man was beating the hell out of a woman outside my home in his car. She was screaming and crying. We called the police and yelled at him to stop and told her to get out of the car. He threw her out of the car while driving. She stumbled into the street with her belongings. He drove off. A fellow neighbor was talking to her. She apparently got into an Uber and it&#039;s been close to 40 minutes and the police still have not showed up. What if they were still fighting? My son wanted to go help but I was afraid the man might have had a weapon. Are we suppose to sit by and watch people be assaulted and the police do not show up?

				This is absolutely horrible. Unfortunately, the response time from the 115th could be anywhere from immediately to never.

				&nbsp;Yes, this is awful. One thing I have found to work around here for whatever reason is to block traffic in the street. Literally put things like garbage cans in the street or refuse to move for cars or any way to not let things move down the street. Squad cars will come. Not the best way certainly, but it is effective and makes law enforcement pay attention.

They&#039;re actually a bit faster this year than last year.<br /><br />Perhaps what happened is they classified it as a &quot;domestic dispute,&quot; which gets a low priority and has like a 70 minute average response.
