Their hyperbolic ramblings make me long for a more grounded, intelligent and substantive debate based in reality:<br /><br />My dream? That eventually 34th Ave sounds like an average street in Jakarta, the incessant buzz of dirt bikes, motor scooters and tuk-tuks piercing the calm air like a yoga mat with a bayonet on the end of it, as senior citizens engage in hand-to-crutch combat over who gets the next non-unionized Uber driver to take them to the doctor. A man in an orange work vest (not a Halloween costume) patrols the avenue with arms horizontally outstretched holding a phone in his right hand, screaming &quot;Mine! Mine! Mine!&quot; into his Live Instagram stream. Smoke and fumes from the cheap engines choke the air, melding with the aroma of nasi goreng from the plentiful food carts setup along the median where denizens with thermos wine congregate to toast one another on a job well done. Chain link fences erected around the school &quot;recess zones&quot; have been painted in bright colors with lead-free paint, but the engine fumes cancel out any health benefit to the children, who stare blankly from behind the fence at a changed world, then go back to playing with their Hot Wheels. I walk my bike through a hazy cloud of putrid oily smoke, my burning eyes glazing past vendor stalls selling organic cider donuts. A 68 year old volunteer drags an unnecessary barricade into the street, but the man in the orange vest stops her, puts a hand on her shoulder, focuses his camera on her face and calmly reassures her, &quot;We&#039;ve won... We&#039;ve won.&quot; But she doesn&#039;t speak English.

And I&#039;m not into how the bike lane has to chicane. I foresee people driving around the dividers or knocking over the plastic poles if that&#039;s what they install.

					Is that your way of saying &quot;it takes one to know one?&quot; Well I respectfully disagree. I want Everyone, and I truly mean EVERYone, to use 34th. Cars and motor vehicles in the single-lane street, bicycles in the bike lane, pedestrians on the ample sidewalk. YOU all want to more or less eliminate two of those three groups and make it regulated to do anything except walk, dance, exercise and play sports on the asphalt of a Jackson Heights Avenue. So, who&#039;s being selfish?

His 80 year old parents who live in the neighborhood aren&#039;t fond of dragging metal gates back and forth especially with winter weather coming. During the summer there were outdoor concerts on Open Streets, exercise classes, improvised ball games, and the constant dragging back and forth of metal gates, which isn&#039;t exactly pleasant for his daughter&#039;s bedroom which faces the Avenue. For people who love to throw around the &quot;Randian selfishness&quot; accusals, the narrow-minded and unenlightened self-interest running rampant in this thread is coming directly from the OS crowd. I&#039;m glad YOUR friends love Open Streets, but perhaps living outside one&#039;s own little fantasy world is what makes New York New York, for me at least. Talk about solipsism!

Cars were the main danger all along!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The Queens Eagle reported that injuries along Open Streets we&#039;re down 42% last year. However injuries citywide we&#039;re down 38%. So while some of the improvement appears to be from Open Streets, clearly the reduced number of people walking about during the pandemic was influential as well. Using statistics from 2020 will always be problematic, since cultural behavior was abnormal. Comparing 2021 to 2019 might be more useful, but I haven&#039;t seen those numbers yet. It&#039;s similar to the law and order crusaders claiming that violence is up due to defunding the police and bail reform, and comparing last year&#039;s abnormally low homicides (when people were on lockdown) to this year&#039;s, when last year&#039;s scores are being settled. While the numbers are accurate, the truth is more complex.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly. Just take a look at the NYPD weekly COMPstat:<br /><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf</a><br /><br />Long-term AND even short term? Crimes down. Way down. Giuliani likes to bash DeBlasio on &quot;crime&quot;, but every major crime has seen a downward trend from Giuliani continuing through Bloomberg and DeBlahz.<br /><br />Same thing with this pedestrian/bicycle injury red herring on Open Streets, and the whopping 4% difference between said injuries on Open Streets versus the whole entire city.

					LOL. This preoccupation with Ayn Rand is hilarious. Where does that even come from? A human powered bicycle rider should not have to get a license to ride their bike. Since when have pedal bicycles become such a health hazard? Who gives a crap about Ayn Randian philosophy w/r/t these issues? We want helmet laws for bicyclists? Make cops pull over every bicycle rider and ticket them. How about hand signaling laws for turning? Maybe a rigorous bicycle test for bike license holders? Can we see how many new laws and regulations we can create for the police to ignore?

I do not agree at all that bicycle riders should be regulated. It&#039;s incredible really; a bunch of volunteers take over a street during a pandemic, ruin a perfectly functioning bike lane, exploit minorities to advance their personal agenda, refuse to give it back after traffic and life begins returning to normal, and now <em>bicycle riders</em> are the enemy? Absurd.
