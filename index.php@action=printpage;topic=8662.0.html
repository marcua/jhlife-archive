				For the record, Italian farms didn&#039;t close, it moved into a much bigger space on 37th, close to 82nd Street. Perhaps rent is cheaper in the new space, I don&#039;t know, but the rent for the old space did not drive them out of business.

				Yes, I had also heard that the Italian Farms rent had gone up to a unrealistic rate and they were very pleased to find that their new location near 82nd street was larger and cheaper.&nbsp; I suppose that fact that the old store was on a corner property has something to do with the rate.&nbsp; I wish Rainbow Berry the best of luck... <br /><br />How long did that other frozen yoghurt chain store last just down the block, less than two year?

				The signage may be off but they&#039;ve nailed the interior in terms of looking inviting to kids in particular. I walked by on opening day and the place had a very nice buzz. It gives that corner an updated look which adds to the variety on the street. A friend had the yogurt and said it wasn&#039;t too sugary. I think they have a better chance of survival than the old yogurt place despite the seasonal challenges.

				I went in on Thursday and was charmed by the friendliness of the staff and the selection of toppings. Went back on Friday and again was treated with a friendly welcome. Tried another set of toppings.<br />Some things are better cold and some are strange. Gummi Bears - not so much. Fruits were terrific.<br />I loved the diversity of the crowd, too. Kids, teens, moms, seniors, all spooning happily.<br />I didn&#039;t go today and miss it! <br />Sunday, maybe.<br />Also a good, fun way to get your daily fruit - but leave off the rainbow sprinkles (my opinion, you may disagree).<br />Are they related to the owner of Italian Farms?

				I&#039;ve been there 3 times, and been happy all three times. I&#039;m checking out all the flavors. And last time I had to figure out what the difference was between cake batter and birthday cake ;) I liked the one that was white and not yellow better.<br /><br />A bit further abroad, but also very good, is the ice cream place by the new kid&#039;s play space on 37th and 94th. It&#039;s called Selatto. It&#039;s more of a traditional they-serve-you place, but the servings are generous and a small was only $2. They have mostly ice cream, a few sorbets, and 1 fat free frozen yogurt (they might have soft serve too). I got the chocolate hazelnut and it was delicious. The weird thing about them is that they share the space with an eyeglasses store.

				&nbsp;Probably renting out the space in front of his store to a independent contractor that is paying him cash rent.&nbsp; I’m sure it must be in his lease that he can sublet the 24 inches in front of his store to make another totally different buisness. Cash buisness.

				It turns out they are selling fruit because the owner of the store owns and runs two farms in New Jersey. At least that&#039;s what the people running the store told me the other day.

				Maybe they should reconsider that decision. I was going to head in there the other evening for the first time since the beginning of the summer and turned away because of the mess in front of their store. (There was fruit in crates inside as well.) And I think we already have enough produce stores in the immediate area.

				Shelby2 -- You make a good point. Some of the stuff, like the peaches, seemed farm fresh. I bought a few white peaches and they were very good. But then I noticed they were selling Driscoll&#039;s strawberries, which aren&#039;t exactly local.<br /><br />It does seem like an odd decision and I&#039;d bet the guy across the street isn&#039;t thrilled.

				I&#039;ve always thought the &quot;yogurt&quot; there was pretty bad. And the owners didn&#039;t seem so swift either. The woman who regularly works behind the counter is completely humorless and just not nice. You&#039;d think a place that wants to attract kids and families would at least try to have someone kind of nice behind the counter. When they started selling fruit on their doorstep you knew the business was probably in bad shape.
