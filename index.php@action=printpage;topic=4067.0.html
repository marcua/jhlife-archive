				Yesterday I noticed at least 7 or so dead birds everywhere I went. We had to remove three from our property the other day. I also noticed a squirrel who didn&#039;t appear to have trauma. Is this from the cold?

				Probably someone is putting poisoned seed out.&nbsp; It happens occasionally in many parts of the city.&nbsp; Some people&#039;s hatred of pigeons causes them to take drastic action and, as you can see, not only pigeons are affected.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame!

				I believe, from my Google searches on the subject, that this comes under the jurisdiction of the DEC or Dept. of Environmental Conservation.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would call or email them and ask exactly how you should handle this.&nbsp; I would also stress that other birds besides pigeons and mammals are being killed by the suspected poison.&nbsp; They can do a necropsy to determine what poison is being used and further investigate..&nbsp; It is not legal to poison urban wildlife.

				I would hope it could also be the cold though, no?&nbsp; I hate to think there are people who dig poisoning birds and squirrels ...<br /><br />Also, squirrels hibernate, no?

				Unless it&#039;s really extreme, which our weather has not been for this area of the world, wildlife are perfectly suited to withstand cold weather.&nbsp; It&#039;s not easy sometimes, but they have adapted to their environment.&nbsp; Squirrels don&#039;t hibernate.&nbsp; I see them running around every day out in Long Island, where I work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there have been several cases of people poisoning birds on a large scale in the city.&nbsp; The target is usually pigeons since many people would like to see them eradicated totally.&nbsp; The poisoners don&#039;t realize or perhaps don&#039;t care that other creatures besides pigeons will eat the poisoned seed.<br /><br />The other possibility is that there is some kind of virus or pathogen that is killing the birds but it&#039;s unlikely that it would then affect a squirrrell as well.
