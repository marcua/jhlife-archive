				I want to put in a good word for this restaurant which is located on the old site of Meson Asturias.&nbsp; It&#039;s at 40-12 83rd St., just south of Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />We had Chicken in Mole sauce and cheese enchiladas, both of which were quite good.&nbsp; The accompanying rice and beans were also very full of flavor.<br /><br />The place is clean and friendly, if not terribly fancy.&nbsp; It&#039;s more of a homey ambiance.<br /><br />I intend to return and try more of their specials.

				Yes, I had a good experience here as well, and the proprietors made us feel like royalty.&nbsp; Will definitely go back.&nbsp; Although, I do miss Meson Arturias.

				Tried it last week -- good tamales, good tacos (actually, both the lengua and al pastor were better than Coatzingo, to which I am addicted), good sauces, good jalapenos. I am looking forward to some of their cooked dishes. <br /><br />Definitely going back. <br /><br />Jeff, what do you get for breakfast?

				I had a nice dinner there yesterday so either the chef is still the same or they got a new who&#039;s also quite good. The enchiladas were good, as were the tacos (in fact, I think the tortillas are better than at Coatzingo). On my way out, I saw that they had goat tacos which I&#039;ve never seen before at Mexican places in the neighborhood. I&#039;ll order them next time.
