				It appears that Trade Fair at 75-07 37th Avenue is in the process of being sold.<br /><br />It is being bought by the cooperative PS Key Food, owned by Mohammed Haque &amp; Jaynal Abdin.<br /><br />They have a number of stores in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope for the best.

				Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say I&#039;m too excited about this development after having seen reviews on Yelp for many of the other Key Food stores.&nbsp; They routinely are getting only 2 to 3 stars (out of 5).&nbsp; In fact, the Key Food in Forest Hills gets an average of only one and a half stars from 16 reviewers!<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=key+foot&amp;find_loc=Queens%2C+NY&amp;ns=1#find_desc=key+food<br /><br />I hope they strive to do better with this location.

				Well...on Yelp... Trade Fair Jax Heights gets an average of 2 stars.<br /><br />So up to 3 stars would be up to a 20% improvement...<br /><br />Thus... it&#039;s good news!

				we had a key food in the neighborhood for many years -- on 37th and 73rd, where the duane reade is now -- and it was always my third choice of local markets. i forget when it closed, 2000-2001 maybe? the produce was really bottom of the barrel.

				Let&#039;s hope they give the place a thorough washing and keep it 24 hours.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope for organization and less chaos.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t expect much from my grocery stores, cleanliness and some sense of order is much appreciated.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t found a grocery here besides Mi Tierra with good produce so it&#039;s no biggie to me on that end - I&#039;ll just keep gong to Tierra for that and the local greenmarket.&nbsp; But it would be nice to have a decent clean grocery store open past 10pm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a Key Food in Astoria and it was pretty similar to the Met/Foodtown.&nbsp; It does the job.

				Let&#039;s hope they give the place a thorough washing and NOT keep it 24 hours.&nbsp; I can hear their delivery trucks at all times of the night.&nbsp; I&#039;m not too keen on Key Food personally, but Trade Fair has proven itself time and again to be horrible neighbors to those around it.&nbsp; I won&#039;t be sad to see them go.

				There were two Key Foods when we moved here. One was, if memory serves, where Patel is now. We used to call it &quot;the dirty Key Food&quot;. The now-Duane Reade one was a bit better in a scruffy sort of way.<br /><br />Well, I&#039;ll miss Tf&#039;s 99 cent mushrooms (when they aren&#039;t out of stock) and their good prices on various staples.<br /><br />I seldom buy fruit and veg at any of the supermarkets. Mostly I go to the produce stores on 37th Ave and on 82nd Street, much better prices. Also Patel and the Asian market on 75th &amp; Broadway, and a couple of others around Broadway and 45th Ave.

				Thanks for sharing the news.&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ll have to stock up on tahini before the transition.&nbsp; Always thought they had good prices on various packaged goods, too.&nbsp; And they don&#039;t alter the sell by date on Murray&#039;s chicken.

				Nothing against Key Food, but it&#039;s just another ordinary supermarket. I&#039;d rather have Trade Fair, with its interesting variety and the opportunity to pick up a staple on the way home at night.

				I sometimes stop at the Key Foods in Astoria in the 40s on 30th Ave--and it is a cut above the grocery stores in JH.&nbsp; They seem to have a decent selection of European style foods that appeal to that neighborhood, so maybe they will maintain some variety here.&nbsp; I usually shop at Fairway, Trader Joe&#039;s and Farmer&#039;s Market for a few things.&nbsp; In my mind, Key Foods seems like an upgrade compared to Food Town.&nbsp; Also, looking forward to seeing what the new Downtown organic market on 84th Street will offer.

				Trade Fair has some really good prices on bulk items; rice, grains, legumes, olives, roasted red peppers and such. I usually avoid because it&#039;s dirty and cramped, but I&#039;d rather have Trade Fair than another standard grocery store; since we already have the Foodtown.

				The only thing I like about Trade Fair is the rotisserie chicken and their being open 24 hours.&nbsp; The store just looks so filthy and I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve ever cleaned their handheld shopping baskets.&nbsp; <br />Their produce is vile so I can&#039;t imagine Key Food&#039;s will be worse.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see, I guess.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hope they hire a manager who takes pride in keeping a clean store.&nbsp;

				After all those union strikes, I really got sour on Trade Fair, haven&#039;t been back since. <br /><br />For fruits/vegs, the independent markets are pretty good and the prices are good too.

				I used to live over by the park in Astoria. The key food under the ditmars train was good, it just looked a little old. They remodeled it some time ago and it looked so much better. <br /><br />I will be sad to lose TF though, it being open 24 hrs was a great thing for convenience and saftey on 37th ave. Good thing we stopped them from using part of the sidewalk. Helped alot..

				I am sorry to say that who ever told you that Trade Fair is here to stay is not being truthful.<br /><br />- There is an application for a new Grocery Beer License for the location - pending with the NYS Liquor Authority<br />(Please note: these applications require a bill of sale for a temporary license, and the lease transfer to issue a permanent)<br /><br />- I have spoken to the landlord&#039;s rep, and he confirmed it<br /><br />- Employees have acknowledged their transfer to another Trade Fair location, as the store is being sold<br /><br />- Tenants in the building where Trade Fair is located have been informed of the change by Trade Fair employees

				Today, the store was closed.<br />A bunch of employees were standing in front of the building, saying the store was, in fact sold and they were told that &quot;they were not needed anymore.&quot;<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t sound good.

				they showed up for work to have the filthy pig of an owner turn them away with no notice and no severance. I posted about it in neighborhood chat here. I wish nothing but ill on the now-former owners -- and nothing but ill on the new owners if they don&#039;t make things right.
