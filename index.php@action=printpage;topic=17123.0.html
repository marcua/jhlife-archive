				Hi there, <br /><br />If you read it carefully, the schedules is about the wine shop, not wine bar. <br /><br />We did not post schedules for the wine bar because we don&#039;t want any confusion. Since the wine shop is called Addictive Boutique Winery and the wine bar is called Addictive Wine and Tapas. <br /><br />Yes, the wine bar have a private event on December 23rd. We politely explained to walk-in customer we have a private event, which we listed on Yelp and Google that we closed for that day. Unfortunately,&nbsp; we didn&#039;t listed on this blogger. <br />We will be more diligent to post here on Jhfamiles next time if we have any private events. We apologized if you were turned away. Understand the person booked the entired restaurant for his staffs that night. <br /><br />Again, we apologized for any inconvenience it might have costed you. We hope to have you soon in the future. <br /><br />Have a happy Holidays and a Happy New Year!<br /><br />Patrick and Francisco <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17123.msg83122.html#msg83122">Quote from: hfm on December 27, 2017, 12:34:14 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=17123.msg83094.html#msg83094">Quote from: ABWinery on December 22, 2017, 11:14:21 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Dear neighbors,<br /><br />Happy Holidays to you all! <br /><br />Here&#039;s our holidays hours. <br /><br />Saturday, December 23rd - 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM<br />Sunday, December 24th -&nbsp; Christmas Eve - 12 noon to 9:00 PM<br />Monday, December 25th - Christmas Day - Closed<br />Tuesday, December&nbsp; 26th - 12 noon to 10:00 PM <br /><br />Thank you and we hope to see you soon! <br /><br />Patrick and Francisco <br /><br />☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆<br />Addictive Boutique Winery <br />3262 87th Street <br />Jackson Heights, NY 11369<br />718-899-8666<br />www.abwinery.com <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not so sure that 12/23 11AM-11PM part was true.
