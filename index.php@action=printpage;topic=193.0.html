				ESL classes are definitely more plentiful than Spanish classes around here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Two general language places that I know of are Zoni Language center (Roosevelt around 78th) and Laguardia Community College (LIC near the 7 train).&nbsp; I don&#039;t have first hand knowledge of either one.<br /><br />There have been Spanish-English exchanges through the New Immigrant Community Empowerment, but I think they most likely won&#039;t be much good if you are a total beginner in Spanish.<br /><br />I have been thinking that I would start with some software like Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy, and then try to graduate on from there to maybe a tutor.&nbsp; A friend has used a NYC guy who has a business called spanishwithpablo.com.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did the trial lesson (free) of Rosetta Stone online but when I read the reviews I realized that I don&#039;t think I will do well with that kind of learning.&nbsp; Supposedly it&#039;s extremely effective but I would caution you to read the reviews on Amazon before spending the huge amounts of money for it.&nbsp; (It might work fine for you but I realized after reading the reviews that I&#039;m not cut out for that kind of thing.)

				There is another language school with a generic name -something like New York Language School - that is on 82nd St. just north of Roosevelt Ave, on the left side as you exit from the 7 train.&nbsp; don&#039;t know anything about it firsthand but thought I would mention that it&#039;s there.

				I have used the Rosetta Stone Cd-roms, and they seem to work pretty well.&nbsp; They are very repetitive, and you catch on quick.

				Saw another place advertising Spanish classes today.&nbsp; It&#039;s in a storefront on 37th Ave between 86th and 87th -if I remember correctly -- I know it&#039;s 2 doors down from the new-ish restaurant Urubamba.&nbsp;

				You can just burn a copy of rosetta stone instead of shelling out a ton of money for it.&nbsp; I did it last year and the software is great.&nbsp; Not that I condone illegal copies or anything, lol.&nbsp; Like someone said earlier, it is very repetitive.&nbsp; I need that though because I forget quickly :D

				As a native New Yorker and former ESL tutor volunteer I would like to see SSL classes (Spanish as A Second Language) offered for free by a competent person or group.<br /><br />It would be nice if there were classes offered in the local schools at night.

				There are a number of language centers in Jackson Heights:<br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Moradian Learning Center (http://www.mlcny.com/)</li><li>New York Language Center (http://www.nylanguagecenter.com)</li><li>Zoni Language Centers (http://www.zoni.com/english/newyork/)</li></ul>Of these, I think only Moradian offers Spanish classes here in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Another option is a Spanish Meetup Group (http://spanish.meetup.com/cities/us/ny/jackson_heights/).&nbsp; You can get together with people to talk in Spanish in a social setting.<br /><br />Personally, I would love to find a Spanish class for my 5-year-old.&nbsp; He is very interested in learning, but most of the materials I can find for him are too &quot;educational&quot; in flavor.&nbsp; He needs something geared for kids, or for parents+kids.&nbsp; There are programs like this in Manhattan, but I haven&#039;t found anything out here.&nbsp; If anybody knows of anything, please let me know.

				There used to be an adult and extended education program at Forest Hills High School, evenings and weekends. It was great. I took Spanish and French there; my kids took tennis, gymnastics, chess and art. The closest thing to it is at Christ the King High School in Middle Village. There are similar course offerings at QCC in Bayside and LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City.

				The attached document will help you understand the different types of Spanish used in many countries.&nbsp; Even though the attached is the usage of Cuban Spanish, it will help you understand the diffrent usages.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Word of warning, there is even a section of the dirty words and their meaning.<br /><br />

				I have to say that Rosetta Stone is the most amazing language program.&nbsp; It is expensive but it is like a class in your computer and to be honest I like it more than the language classes that I have taken.

				I&#039;ve been thinking of taking a Spanish class and I found this thread helpful. I definitely prefer a class with a group of students. I&#039;ve tried computer programs in the past for other languages and I struggle with this approach to learning. I like to be able to ask questions to understand things better and I always find that I learn just as much from other students as I do from a teacher in any class.<br /><br />Since Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in our neighborhood, I was wondering if any of you have suggestions of where to take a class other than what has been mentioned here already. It does not have to be in our neighborhood, just a language class or school with a good reputation somewhere in the city. I also prefer a reasonably priced class.<br /><br />Thank you in advance!
