				i rarely shop there because i prefer to give my cash to local places like Frank&#039;s, but when there&#039;s a big sale on something i can stock up on, i bend. went in the other day for that, and saw ZERO carts. and no people pushing any around the aisles. the very pleasant woman who i approached told me people just take them. literally just push them out of the store and never come back. yes, they need to work on loss prevention, but doggone, that&#039;s a sleazy thing to do.

				In other places where this happens, like I have seen it in Bushwick for instance, the store installs a series of metal poles at the entrance. To make it impossible when a person exits, to navigate a path around them with a cart.

				Ha, last year as I left that Duane Reade, I remember feeling a bit creeped out because a guy was staring at me very intensely as I walked out. I got a few feet down the block before I realized he was looking at me because I walked out with one of the hand baskets; I was totally oblivious and didn&#039;t notice. I brought it back right away and the guy was still in line and we had a good laugh over it. <br /><br />
