				I havent seen anyone mention anything about hispanic men harassing young girls and women in jackson heights. I see it a lot on jackson heights post but never here. So i wanted to bring it here and vent about it. I am sick of these men thinking its okay to harass us. I see it almost everyday and its disgusting and sad. I started speaking up for myself when i get hit on, and when i do ,they start yelling at me like its my fault. What is wrong with them? What makes them think its okay to whistle at us like were dogs?Did we ask to be touched ..no!!! Not to mention it is summer and all i want to do is wear dresses, shorts and tank tops, but i cant even do that because of these perverts.

				I have witnessed it myself. This is part of a culture clash that I find infuriating. Men from the third world are raised to see women as either mothers or whores. I know that it is not politically correct to say but their mentality needs to be challenged otherwise we are subjected to their will.

				There may be some Hispanic and non-Hispanic men in Jackson Hts. that some times act inappropriately towards young women or ladies but for the most part they are the exception.It is my experience that most young men in jackson hts. hispanic or not are very respectable of women in general. There will always be a few perverts that will happen any where.&nbsp;

				frank as a man you have no idea what women have to go through. This is a real issue and it happens quite often in JH. Not only do they do this to women but young girls. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve had to get into a perverts face because they were being disgusting towards my daughters! Some years back while walking with my then 12 yr old past the garden school field, some disgusting man went behind my daughter and made lewd remarks. He had no idea my husband was behind us. My husband picked him up by his neck and let him have it. I am not condoning violence but when you want to act that way toward children you deserve it! Why can&#039;t women walk in public without being harassed?&nbsp; &nbsp;There are also a lot of men in the area on the sex offender registry list. A lot of them live in apartment buildings. I would encourage everyone to take a look and see if it is one of your neighbors!

				Frank, I&#039;m a guy and I see it happen all the time.&nbsp; The OP is correct -- it&#039;s friggin hot and if a woman wants to go out in shorts and a tank, she should be able to do so without having guys make snide comments as they pass by, or stop and check them out continually to the point of it being uncomfortable.&nbsp; It is a real issue, and guys need to learn to be respectful.&nbsp; It&#039;s also not exactly isolated to this neighborhood.&nbsp;

				One of the frustrations about street harassment of women is the tendency for some men to play down how big of a problem it really is for women. Street harassment of women is nothing more than letting women know they are not welcome to occupy public space without it being made clear to them they are not truly safe in that space. <br /><br />That so many men tend to discount it I think is often rooted in the incorrect belief that because because those guys don&#039;t see it happen much, it&#039;s not a real issue, ignoring the fact that the reason they don&#039;t see it much is because the harassers don&#039;t do it to women accompanied by men. They also don&#039;t understand why something as seemingly innocuous as strange men telling women to &quot;smile&quot; on the street is a statement that women exist for the sole pleasure of men, don&#039;t have a right to exist in public without performing for their benefit, nor have a right to an interior life that has nothing to do with men.

				I&#039;m well beyond the age of attracting this kind of attention, but I still remember a strange encounter leaving the subway years ago.

				^^ Here&#039;s what a lot of guys don&#039;t get. A woman confronting a man never knows what she&#039;s going to get. Is he going to sheepishly back off? Or is he going to verbally assault her? Or follow her? Or be the nut bag that physically assaults her?<br /><br />&quot;There is no greater threat to women than men.&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDh4qk1Tl8k (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDh4qk1Tl8k)

				I&#039;ve lived in Manhattan and Astoria before here, and the street harassment has happened everywhere.&nbsp; It sucks and I always have to walk around with my guard up, especially at night.&nbsp; Jackson Heights is no exception and I&#039;d reckon it&#039;s worse with the amount of cabarets, gentleman&#039;s clubs, prostitution, drugs, and gangs here.&nbsp; Just last month, after zumba class, I was walking home on one of the side streets and a man walking towards me stepped in front blocking my path.&nbsp; I had to yell angrily for him to get the fuck out of my way - he did, but I was left shaken and angry.&nbsp; Men have no right to do this.&nbsp; It disgusts me to no end and I&#039;m convinced that until parents and peers stop teaching, accepting, and/or tolerating this behavior, it will never cease.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been followed, harassed, told to smile, threatened with rape when I was younger for not saying hello in Washington Square Park, grabbed by a bicyclist, it never stops.&nbsp; And it never matters what you wear.&nbsp; I realize that not all men do this, but plenty do and I hate every minute of it.&nbsp; Time for another self-defense class.

				^^and I&#039;d add that it is <strong>*decent men&#039;s* </strong>responsibility to call out this kind of despicable behavior. Whether it&#039;s coming to a woman&#039;s defense and telling a harasser to back-off and that he should be ashamed of himself, or a man telling his friends and family that kind of behavior is despicable and he will not tolerate or be friendly with someone who intimidates women. <br /><br />Violence against women is often portrayed as a woman&#039;s issue - whether it&#039;s domestic violence or street harassment. That thinking has to change. This is a <strong>*men&#039;s*</strong> issue that victimizes women.

				I found it much worse when I lived in DC than I do here, not sure why (probably because I was so much younger then, sigh). The only thing that works for me is to smile back and humanize myself. I used to get harassed every day when I walked by a car wash on my way to the Metro, and I started saying good morning with a big smile every time I walked by and they ended up treating me like a human being instead of a piece of meat. The dynamic completely shifted and the same dudes who made kissing noises at me became protective of me instead.&nbsp; <br /><br />But if it&#039;s just a random walk-by instead of someone I see everyday I don&#039;t bother; I just scowl.&nbsp; And then you get told to smile, lol! Has any man ever been told to smile by a complete stranger?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; It&#039;s so patronizing. (I&#039;m glad to see Capt. Flannel brought up the same thing)&nbsp;

Some years back I realized, with some relief, that it had been a long time since it had happened to me. Yeah, I&#039;d gotten older, so it was kinda to be expected, but also, I didn&#039;t notice it happening to other women as much. Maybe it had something to do with where I&#039;d moved (Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn).<br /><br />At my end of Jackson Heights (73rd-74th, 35th Ave), I don&#039;t notice the South Asian men paying attention to women at all. I assume that&#039;s a cultural thing. And while occasionally I&#039;ll see a non–South Asian man ogling a young woman, I haven&#039;t noticed much verbal harassment. I&#039;m sorry this abuse is still so bad. My old anger and resentment are boiling up now, reading about it.

				Consider getting some pepper spray. They are a little bulky, but you can get ones that you can carry on your key chain (and importantly, can easily be removed and left at home when you&#039;re going some place with a security check).<br /><br />I find if I&#039;m in a public place with others lots of other people around, loud confrontation from a distance does well. A lot of these guys really seem to expect a woman to just quietly take this kind of harassment and often seem bewildered when she speaks out loudly and aggressively in public. Pulling out your phone and letting them know you&#039;re calling the police also communicates clearly there could be very negative consequences to their actions. It might not be a tactic for late at night or on a side street when no one else is around, but along a busy commercial area that provides store fronts to pop in to and with enough distance, I think it works well. Women should be encouraged to use their voices loudly and aggressively when someone makes them feel unsafe in a public space.

				&nbsp;And I would say pull out your phone and get pictures - then include them in your text message to the Police. <br /><br />&nbsp;There was a group of grown men harassing young girls crossing 34th Ave to IS145. Got out my phone and said <br />&quot;Stop it now because you are being filmed- plus you are old enough to be their fathers and grandfathers. You <br />should be their protectors&quot;. They took off like a bat outta hell. <br />&nbsp;Sadly, the behavior of the girls as they were so tightly locked around one another suggested that they have <br />alot of these encounters. We all need to help protect our young from predatory behavior especially in their <br />own neighborhood.<br />

I was born and raised in a developing country and I was not raised to do any of these things. And the many times that I have been to other developing countries none of the men I interacted with had any such views. Last time I checked several countries in developing nations have or have had women presidents or prime ministers, such Chile, Argentina, India and many others. I find your comment offensive to say the least. It is not a question of &quot;them&quot; or &quot;us&quot; is education for ALL MEN. After all the U.S. produces and markets the most porn in the world and this is the sort of thing that objectifies women.

				^you really want to turn this in to a discussion of whether or not porn objectifies women and leads to violence against women? <br /><br />There certainly are cultural issues at play here. I wouldn&#039;t play the &quot;third world&quot; card as after all, white dudes in certain professions (construction) seem to be prone to catcalling. But I also wouldn&#039;t counter that since there have been women heads of state in some of those countries, there aren&#039;t issues (i.e. acid attacks.)Let&#039;s not downplay how women are harassed in a seemingly non-threatening ways -- following a woman, whispering disgusting things to her as she passes, calling out to her with terms of endearment not appropriate from strangers, &quot;smile, it can&#039;t be that bad!&quot; (Yes, yes it can. But thank you so much buddy for reminding me I&#039;m not allowed to be a fully actualized human being with a life that has absolutely nothing to do with pleasing you the moment I step foot in the public space.)<br /><br />What&#039;s deemed to be acceptable street harassment of women varies from culture to culture, from sub culture to sub culture. Thank goodness change can happen. I remember my friend&#039;s parents talking about how when they were young, women almost never took the subway alone, because they were likely to have to fend off groping, and that they thought the reason that had changed was because women today would raise holy hell if subjected to that kind of assault.<br /><br />

				This is a huge problem in Jackson Heights, and in NYC in general. I&#039;m in my early twenties, female, and have suffered from street harassment the entire time I&#039;ve lived in this neighborhood, on a constant basis (more often on Roosevelt and side streets). I&#039;ve gotten the simple stuff, like wolf whistles and catcalls and disgusting comments and stares.<br /><br />There have been worse situations, as well. Multiple times, men have tried to follow me home, asking me where I live. I&#039;ve been followed down Roosevelt Avenue with men trying to grab me. Usually they back off when I respond with extreme anger, but I can&#039;t always do that because I never know if that response is going to get me hurt or worse. I&#039;ve actually asked my boyfriend to walk behind me down the street for ten minutes, pretending he doesn&#039;t know me, so he can see how many guys give me lewd stares or make inappropriate comments. I&#039;ve even had to shoo away a disgusting man who followed a young girl (probably around 14) off the 7 train trying to touch her and talk to her.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a cultural thing, although almost 100% of the men who have done this to me in JH have been Hispanic/Latino (often speaking Spanish and thinking I don&#039;t understand -- I am fluent). I think it&#039;s a matter of education; men with education, especially on social issues, seem to be less likely to be street harassers. Obviously, anyone can be a street harasser or a rapist, but it&#039;s definitely not a racial thing as some people on this thread have implied. My boyfriend is Latino and neither he nor any of his loved ones/friends were raised to think like this -- he agrees that it is perpetuated by ignorance.<br /><br />Men...it is important to educate yourselves on the issues facing women today, like this. With understanding and support I hope this kind of nonsense won&#039;t be happening on the same scale when I eventually have kids someday. If you see a man harassing a woman, CALL HIM OUT!

All this stuff was happening to me as early as middle school (street harassment) and it took years for me to realize how wrong it was and that I didn&#039;t deserve it. I&#039;m glad feminism has become more &quot;mainstream&quot; nowadays because even a few years ago when I was in high school, I didn&#039;t know what it properly was. Now feminist activism is gaining traction with younger people, male and female, which is great.

				ehh lets not confuse topics... i cant stand feminism...lol. I think its caused more harm than good. But that has nothing to do with being able to respect women, or any human being for that matter.<br /><br />I also think the immigrants that come here are lonely and have a &quot;nothing to lose&quot; attitude with women.
