Restaurants are opening every single day in this city, and this forum jerked itself off for years fantasizing about Stew&#039;s &quot;fine dining&quot; raw oyster no ambient music closet of an eatery? Best part of the old threads was the poster &quot;Stevn&quot; who turned out to be absolutely right from the beginning. Nexxxxt!!!

			This saga was all part of the learning curve of being on this forum.<br /><br />Kinda an insider glimpse on &quot;how not to open a restaurant&quot;.<br /><br />Stew wanted to document &quot;starting a restaurant&quot; for the public. In order to promote the restaurant. And it was interesting.<br /><br />But ironically, it became even more fascinating when the situation flipped into &quot;lessons on how not to open a restaurant&quot;. <br /><br />Fantastic points... like &quot;DON&#039;T GET FIXATED ON DECOR AND BLOW ALL YOUR BUDGET&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;and then have nothing left to go through the process of city requirements for a restaurant.<br /><br />Also, maybe &quot;DON&#039;T ALIENATE POSSIBLE FUTURE CUSTOMERS DUE TO YOUR THIN SKIN .&quot; <br /><br />Thank you Stew for the many teaching experiences via this forum.<br /><br />It reminds me... I will miss this forum.&nbsp; Where I have been called male by some and female by others.<br /><br />Good thing it&#039;s a gender fluid era we live in.<br /><br /><br />

But the USA certainly hasn&#039;t been until now. Hooray to the USA for catching up!<br /><br />In the future, the USA may even learn to accept and respect each others&#039; political views. <br /><br />And not descend into personal attacks. <br /><br />Here&#039;s to that enlightened future!
