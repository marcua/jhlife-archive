				Around last week or so, there was a massive search for a little lost dog named Bruno the Brussels.&nbsp; The search extended to social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook.&nbsp; Footwork campaigns were also launched with people distributing fliers around the neighborhood.&nbsp; The efforts paid off, as Bruno was able to be reunited with his owners, Jeff Simmons and Alfonso Quiroz. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>The New York Times, City Room Blog</strong> has a nice follow-up today on the story of Bruno the Brussels.<br /><br />A Little Dog Touches Off a Big Search (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/a-little-dog-touches-off-a-big-search/)<br /><br />

				I had received a robo-call from LostMyDoggie, but I was unable to find any further info on the website lostmydoggie.com <br /><br />Good parents! <br /><br />If only missing children would get that much attention.
