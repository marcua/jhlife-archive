				Anyone with some news on the opening of Romeo&#039;s Italian Restaurant, Arepa Lady &amp; Mario&#039;s Pizza (former location of Fresh Split Milk)?&nbsp; Romeo&#039;s began construction in August 2017 so I would imagine they should open soon.&nbsp; Arepa Lady was expected to open late March 2018.&nbsp; What came as a surprise is Mario&#039;s Pizza returning.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m looking forward to all three opening especially Romeo&#039;s.&nbsp;

				Arepa Lady is definitely moving along. the interior doesn&#039;t look *finished*, but they&#039;ve made some major inroads already. haven&#039;t been able to see inside Romeo&#039;s, but looking forward to seeing what they come up with.

				I have written on this forum quite a few times about Argentine pizza. There used to be an Argentinian pizzeria around 2007-2008, which was right at the foot of the 7 train on 90th. It closed and the owner/manager reopened for a short few months in and concurrent with Party Pizza (where Sac&#039;s is now). There is a home-style version almost always available at La Gran Uruguaya bakery and also at La Nueva bakery. <br /><br />I can&#039;t remember it ever being greasy. It&#039;s my favorite of all the everyday-type pizzeria pizzas, i.e. pre-baked, sold by slice, quick, inexpensive.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t doubt, in fact I hope, it&#039;s the same guy opening at the spilt milk address.

				i love Argentinian pizza -- the style is distinctive, and the pizzaolas really pay attention to the dough, which is neither cracker thin nor sicilian style, almost puffy in a way. it&#039;d be cool if that were the case up the block.

				Driving to Jamaica Bay yesterday, we passed another Romeo&#039;s--maybe in Howard Beach? Not just the same name, it had the same big red signage, only this one said &quot;Romeo&#039;s Pizza and Pasta.&quot; From what I could see quickly passing by, it seemed like it might be similar to the pizza place in the Roosevelt 74th St station. It didn&#039;t look as much like a real Italian restaurant as it did a typical pizza place. But maybe they will be trying something new--who knows. I wonder if there are other locations.

I&#039;m also looking forward to Arepa Lady&#039;s opening. <br /><br />It looks like the two other businesses, Mamma Rosa&#039;s pizzeria, and Romeo&#039;s are also getting closer to an opening date. Mamma Rosa&#039;s has a &quot;now hiring&quot; sign, and Romeo&#039;s just had new windows installed. I took a peek at Romeo&#039;s interior recently, and noticed how the former Armando&#039;s sidewalk seating extension had made a big difference in terms of size. Of course, Romeo&#039;s appears smaller, but its brick walls lend kind of a rustic and cozy appeal to the smaller space.&nbsp; Keeping fingers crossed!

				The door was open yesterday at Arepa Lady and the place is completely gutted.&nbsp; Since they took over the space in January, I was expecting to see it nearly finished.&nbsp; It must have taken a very long time to receive the Permits from the City.&nbsp; It won&#039;t open for many months.&nbsp; Next month will be one year that Romeo&#039;s began working on its space and I have no idea what has been accomplished since the door is never open.&nbsp; Sagar Chinese began working on its space in August 2017 and opened in mid January 2018.&nbsp; I have no idea what the status is of the Pizza Place or the Sushi Place.&nbsp; Anyway, by the end of the year we will see 4 new restaurants open below 78th Street.&nbsp;
