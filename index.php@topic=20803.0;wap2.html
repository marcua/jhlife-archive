			&nbsp;Want to let people know that lunch at Uncle Peters on Northern Blvd is usually pretty great but it&#039;s a special kind of restaurant for a splurge lunch here in JH. It&#039;s the food and the atmosphere and the professional staff that elevate the whole experience. An added feature of the outdoor dining shed is that the normal street traffic from Northern Blvd. is diminished and it&#039;s nice and quiet inside. Don&#039;t work for them but have been a couple of times lately and was pleasantly surprised at how nice the experience was. Any other favorites out there for a special place for lunch?

			Bistro Eloise also has a nice lunch service, and what might be the best weekend brunch in the neighborhood (the crepes, actual buckwheat ones, are my favorite). they also have an outdoor tent structure. heating elements are suspended from the top, so they radiate nicely.

			&nbsp;Thanks for these suggestions! Both excellent restaurants that I have to be reminded to visit some of the time. We are very lucky here to have even just these three restaurants, never mind the many others with amazing food.
