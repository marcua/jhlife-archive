				<strong></strong>Jackson Heights Garden Club Fundraiser Sunday Sept 14 5-8pm<strong></strong><br /><br /><br />Its a great party with the proceeds going to the Garden Club for the Purchase of tree surrounds on 37th Ave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Tickets&nbsp; are $55 per person, tax deductible.&nbsp; There will be live music, beer, wine and canapes outside in the garden. Please call 718-476-1911 for more information or questions. Since this is at a private home (period photograph below of house) only 125 tickets will be sold, and adults only please. <br /><br />(I&#039;m posting this for my friends who are hosting the party at their house on 86th Street bet. 34th/35th Avenues. They&#039;ve hosted this fundraiser for past couple years now in their back yard, which is gorgeous, and there&#039;s always a great turn-out.)<br /><br />edited to add: the masthead photo for JHLife is of this house where the fundraiser is being held.&nbsp; AND one of the owners of the house is the guy who considered opening a French Bistro but rents were too high here.&nbsp; So the canapes are yummy.)

				The Fundraiser is to raise money to purchase the metal tree surrounds on 37th ave. Ive been having the party for the past 6 years, and really enjoy having the opportunity to have an event like this.I think the event purchased like 30 tree surrounds thru the years.&nbsp; Its a garden Party, so the dress is casual. The food is great, as is the live music. Its 3 hours of eating, drinking and getting to know your neighbors( if you want to ;) If your new to Jackson heights, its a great way to see one of the oriiginal English Garden Homes.&nbsp; But since this is at a private home,&nbsp; i have to limit the number of Tickets to 125, and respectfully ask, adults only.&nbsp; Richard

				I have some photos of the house front and back gardens but I&#039;ll have to do several posts since you can only put two photos at a time (I think).<br /><br />This house is so beautiful and the back yard makes you feel like you&#039;re not living in the City.&nbsp; &nbsp;first two are of front of house and side entrance.
