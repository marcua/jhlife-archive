					The fact is there is little or no live music in JH.&nbsp; You have to leave the neighborhood to see/hear live music.&nbsp; Yes, there is the solo/duo here and there but there is not much else.&nbsp; Part of the reason is the ethnic/cultural makeup and part is the real estate issue.&nbsp; Lots of families and not many young singles or young couples and real estate is crazy.&nbsp; By 8:00 on a weekend night most things are shut down.&nbsp; The only night life is on Roosevelt and that can be a bit on the seedy side and not about music.&nbsp; As (or if) the nabe changes we may see music and theatre etc but it may take a while.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the audience or the venues at this time.&nbsp;

					Alex, who owns Kelly&#039;s Cleaners, is retiring some time this year.&nbsp; So that space will be vacant.&nbsp; The landlord apparently was not letting the tenants sign leases but would go month to month.&nbsp; He wants to build up on top of what is there.&nbsp; The furniture store next to Kelly&#039;s every couple of months has a going out of business sign up.&nbsp; I guess he then works out something with the building owner.&nbsp;

					A good time for yoga classes would be Saturday mornings and weekday evenings not too late (say 6:00 or 6:30)&nbsp; The Sat. morning class at the school was huge.&nbsp; Granted it was free and funded by a grant from Emblem but there would be 60 plus there.&nbsp; The space held it (Renaissance School)&nbsp; I would bet a $5 Sat. morning would draw a large group.&nbsp; $10 smaller but still a nice turn out I believe. And the weekday evenings would be great.&nbsp; My two cents.&nbsp;

					I like the way this conversation is going.&nbsp; Yes, I do agree that NYC cannot sustain the number of cars it presently has and will continue to have.&nbsp; We need to redefine our cities.&nbsp; Just as in the 50s &amp; 60s the urban planners redesigned our urban areas for cars (which pretty much destroyed many urban centers) we need redefine/redesign our cities for the future.&nbsp; This will not happen overnight but is a gradual process as we slowly make the automobile obsolete in cities.&nbsp; By doing this we will also recreate our city culture and create more viable and autonomous neighborhoods.&nbsp; Suburbs are beginning to see a deterioration as the young, ambitious and creative move to urban areas.&nbsp; Many of these are not as wedded to the car ideal as those who grew up in the 50s &amp; 60s.&nbsp; I would like to see the beginning of mass transit becoming the center of our infrastructure renewal.&nbsp; The automobile as a machine requires an enormous amount of space compared with mass transit.&nbsp; Cars require wide roads, parking areas etc.&nbsp; This land could be better used for parks and dwellings.&nbsp; Just look at GCP or the BQE and all the side street parking.&nbsp; Imagine that space freed up for other use.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					We need to begin to think of cities in terms of people and not cars.&nbsp; Cars have their place but it is primarily in the suburbs and exurban communities were everything is spread out.&nbsp; The suburbs were designed for the car.&nbsp; Urban areas were designed for people but somehow, along the way, we tried to squeeze suburban transportation options into tight, congested cities that were never designed for cars.&nbsp; Consequently, our mass transit systems have suffered.&nbsp; They are deteriorating and few new mass transit systems are being built or expanded especially here in NYC.&nbsp; I would love to see a re-visioning of our city putting people at the center of urban planning, renewal, and expansion.&nbsp; The more people who move into our city (and that&#039;s a good thing) the more we need to plan our space better.&nbsp; Cars simply take up more space than people.&nbsp; They require huge swaths of areas to move (streets/roads), spaces for parking etc.&nbsp; Just the car itself takes up so much more square footage than a human.&nbsp; They have become traveling mini-houses.&nbsp; Anyway, let the dialogue begin.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					One of the problems is JH has been overbuilt over the past 40 years or so, hence we have no sizable public park space, congested traffic, crowded sidewalks among other things.&nbsp; The idea is to re-vision our neighborhood.&nbsp; We are very lucky to have so many mass transit options e.g. many subway lines/bus routes in JH.&nbsp; Whatever we can do to cut down on traffic and open up space for people I think would be a step forward.&nbsp; This is not an anti-car idea.&nbsp; Parking solutions are possible.&nbsp; Perhaps a neighborhood parking garage on Northern (?)&nbsp; We don&#039;t need to think in terms of the car being the center of our community that we have to work around.&nbsp; This is about the quality of life on the street.&nbsp; It would be nice if we could actually begin a dialogue on how we would like to see how our neighborhood should evolve/improve.&nbsp; In its creation JH was a planned community.&nbsp; Now it has become a hodge podge of buildings with little planning.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					What I would do, and this is a radical vision, is make all of 37 Ave between 77th &amp; 90th Sts. carless.&nbsp; Also, 82nd and 74th Sts (the two commercial streets) between Roosevelt &amp; 37 Ave would be carless.&nbsp; Delivery trucks, at certain times of the day (mornings) could&nbsp; come and make drop off/pick ups.&nbsp; Bikes would be ok if their speed was monitored.&nbsp; What we would have would be extension of restaurants (like in Lisbon) setting up in the middle of the streets, sidewalk cafes, and shoppers strolling.&nbsp; A byproduct of this would be safe areas around the schools.&nbsp; This would also lessen the congestion of crowded sidewalks.&nbsp; And, of course, create a very welcoming environment that would attract shoppers/diners from other parts of the city.&nbsp; Just my &quot;vision.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Obviously, most of these posts are by amateurs.&nbsp; Being a professional I have to chime in here.&nbsp; Korean chicken places with craft beer, sports bars with 20 TVs, bowling alleys, pick-up joints, restaurants serving drinks etc are not places one goes to spend a lot of time drinking with friends.&nbsp; They are places one might go once in a while but not a couple times a week or every week.&nbsp; If you want to learn what a good bar is you might want to try visiting some of the pubs/bars in Woodside, Sunnyside, Astoria etc.&nbsp; We do not have any nice old style bars here where locals can hang out/meet friends, where women can go and hang, where there might be a small drinking garden out back, where the old and the young can spend time together, a place that&#039;s an extension of your living room.&nbsp; That is what the traditional NYC bar is/was.&nbsp; We do not have this here, sadly.&nbsp; It would be nice and in the future someone might get inspired (and get some) and open one.&nbsp; There might be a market here for the right pub/bar (or maybe not.)&nbsp; This is a wonderful neighborhood in many ways but this is one thing we don&#039;t have.&nbsp; Maybe some day.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Bellabella.&nbsp; Please.&nbsp; I NEVER said Claudio should abandon the cat or did Claudio even mention abandoning the cat.&nbsp; I was only saying people should not judge why he/she must find another home for his/her cat.&nbsp; People have all sorts of reason (health, moving, whatever) for having to give up a cat.&nbsp; And it can be a very painful ordeal.&nbsp; Let&#039;s help someone and not attack them.&nbsp; The fact that this person went on JH to seek help shows how caring a cat owner they are.&nbsp; People who abandon cats don&#039;t bother posting/asking for help.&nbsp; And I am and have been all my life a cat person.&nbsp; Have had cats since childhood and have loved each one of them.&nbsp; Still have a cat and probably will always have one (or two.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

					Hey cat people (I&#039;m one) let&#039;s not be so judgmental.&nbsp; People sometimes have to move long distances or into places that do not allow cats or dogs.&nbsp; Chill.&nbsp; Help this person out if you can.&nbsp;
