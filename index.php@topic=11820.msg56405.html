								<div class="inner" id="msg_56327">I actually don&#039;t think they purposefully took down the notices in the elevators - the one notice was still up in my lobby, why leave that? I thought myself that it may be a general &quot;no postings in the elevator&quot; type of rule, previous buildings I have lived in had the same rule. But, like you EricaS, I sometimes give too much credit...<br /><br />As for who pays for lawyers and engineers - any tenants happen to be lawyers or engineers? You&#039;re right EricaS, they don&#039;t come cheap. Maybe a call to Danny Dromm for some guidance would be in order - are there lawyers or engineers who offer this kind of work pro-bono to tenants associations? <br /><br />How about any posters on here who lived through this (or are living through this) - any advice? <br /><br />Whatever the case, I agree - I&#039;m sure the sponsor/owner won&#039;t be paying -- it would be down to the TA to pay or get the services pro-bono. <br /><br />I have a number of questions too - I&#039;ll post them here since there have been a ton of conversions in JH up and down 35th Avenue in the last 20 years (and more) maybe some posters who have first hand knowledge of the process can give us here some insight!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" /><br /><br />1. Why convert to a co-op vs. a condo? Are there any benefits or downsides to the sponsor and/or tenants going with one over the other? I know the overwhelming majority of buildings in JH went co-op, but some on conversion did go condo (The Delano, The Colton). More recently, The Carlton on 85th went co-op while Stratford Hall on 35th and 80th went condo.&nbsp; If I recall correctly, normally co-ops have a cheaper buy-in but higher monthlies, while the opposite is true in a condo. But that&#039;s about all I know - anyone have any insight? <br /><br />2. How many seats does the sponsor retain on the Board and how do they lose them as more units are sold? I ask this as I have a friend who lived in a converted co-op a few blocks up on 35th where the sponsor held the majority of the seats for quite some time, meaning they could (and did) block a number of things the board/owners wanted to do with the co-op, determined which contractors got the jobs, which management company they employed, etc., and it was only recently (within the last 5 years) the owners made the majority on that board. Something to think about. <br /><br />3. Can current tenants get out of their leases and get the insider prices if they want to purchase one of the vacant apartments on conversion? Maybe the tenant wants a better view, a quieter apartment, a bigger apartment, etc.. How about later on as tenants opt to move and more sponsor units go up for sale? <br /><br />4. House Rules - if the current owners have been letting certain rules slide and not enforcing them (i.e.; cats, carpeting, etc.) since the co-op is technically a new owner, could non-compliance with these house rules be used as a reason not to renew leases? <br /><br />5. Engineers Report - I was a bit unnerved by how often he used the term &quot;fair&quot; (windows, roof) and &quot;acceptable&quot; (elevators, window sills, skylights) in the report versus &quot;good&quot; when describing their condition. I also thought they were pretty vague on any pointing needs. These are all big ticket items and since the building is sold &quot;As Is&quot; it would fall to the co-op owners to pay for replacements/repairs. From my friends in the neighborhood, I know assessments to cover new windows or elevators can be $300 or so a month, on top on maintenance and mortgage payments. My last apartment I was subletting from a non-occuping owner - his maintenance was about $720 a month, my rent gave him double that - which covered his mortgage and gave him a few bucks too. The building had an assessment for pointing/roof repairs for a year and for that year, he made no money off my rent - I actually think he may have been slightly in the red. Imagine? Also, when co-ops need an influx of cash in cases like this, this is when they look to get rid of tenants in favor of buyers. <br /><br />6. The Vacant Apartments - as they are owned by the sponsor, will they be counted towards the 15% needed to convert? If I counted correctly, there are 24 vacant apartments in WP so something to consider. That makes it so much easier to reach the 15%, right? <br /><br />As for the basement access after 8PM, I figured it was a safety issue, which I totally understand and concur with. However, I would hope some compromise could be had - perhaps locking the outside doors at 8PM but allowing the elevators to go down to the basement until the doormen go off duty to give tenants access to laundry. Just my two cents on this issue. <br /><br />I&#039;m hoping some other JH posters who have experience with this whole conversion process will post -- or maybe we need a new thread asking for their help and insight?<br /></div>

All notices were still up in my building yesterday evening and this morning. <br /><br />Reading through your questions, I think a few are answered in the offering, but I don&#039;t have the book with me, so going from memory and subject to my interpretation and paraphrasing:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3.

After the 90 days, current tenants can make an offer on any apartment, but would no longer receive the preferential pricing. Even if the tenant decides they want to purchase their current apartment, once the 90 days is up, so is the price. Not sure if they&#039;d make exceptions, but I thought this part of the book was pretty clear.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4.

It looks like the current managing agency will remain in place well into the process (not sure at what % sold the management/maintenance is handed over to the co-op, but I think it&#039;s much higher than 15%), and the only thing that would subject you to a new set of house rules would be if your unit was purchased; your landlord would then be the individual owner of your apartment, and you&#039;d be subject to that individual&#039;s rules. There are City and State rules governing what the individual owner can do in terms of services and rent hikes, but I don&#039;t think there is anything governing what house rules they can impose/enforce.<br /><br />Now, whether or not the current managing agency will continue to be relaxed in their enforcement is another issue, and one I&#039;m not sure anyone can predict. Of note: Home Depot on Northern is having a tent sale on carpets in the parking lot.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">6.

But from what I can decipher from the book, vacant apartments that are purchased by buyers that intend to occupy the apartment count toward the total. So the sponsor simply holding onto them doesn&#039;t make them necessarily count, they have to be sold first.<br /><br />ProdigalSon, Lillybell, gsmayes, and any other WP tenants - any interest in grabbing a beer/soda at Legends sometime this weekend to throw questions around, etc. in advance of the meeting? Let me know, I&#039;m around all weekend (although tonight I wouldn&#039;t be available until 9 or so).<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_56443">The meeting was very informative, and there was a pretty good turnout. Lots of new info, but really too much to share on this forum. There will be more meetings to follow, so you should keep an eye out and attend the next one if you can. <br /><br />In the meantime, the Tenant&#039;s Association is trying to get organized and put an email list together, so the best way to stay looped in is to join. They were handing out registration forms at the meeting - perhaps there are extras in the Super&#039;s office? If not, I&#039;m sure he could point you in the right direction as to how to register. (The forms do have the organizing members&#039; names on them, but I feel a little odd disclosing names and apartment numbers publicly on the web. Sorry.)</div>
