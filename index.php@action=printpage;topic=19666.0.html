				&nbsp;We are in need of a primary care physician for our insurance coverage asap. We have lost our doctor of many years who went full time into a specialty practice and we did not read the paperwork<br />carefully. Now it&#039;s semi-urgent to find someone to fill a couple of prescriptions. <br />&nbsp;Anybody out there in a five mile or so radius that you recommend? Manhattan is fine but Queens is preferred. Thanks very much!

				I have not so great insurance so I&#039;m limited in terms of providers, but I have found Q Care (Dr. Charlotten) excellent for my needs. In Elmhurst near the park across from the hospital. https://www.yelp.com/biz/q-care-affordable-medical-care-elmhurst<br /><br />You might also think about whether an urgent care could fulfill your immediate needs?

				I went to Dr Charlotten for the first time in January 2019 for basic tests.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any health issues. I was extremely impressed with Dr Charlotten.&nbsp; The next day, I received the results of the tests by email.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to return for the results.&nbsp; Dr. Charlotten graduated from Stanford University Medical School just ranked #3 in the USA after Harvard and John Hopkins.&nbsp; I have another appointment in March.&nbsp;

				We use NYU Langone.&nbsp; They have a large group of doctors in the network and take most insurances.&nbsp; What we like about them is results are sent online and all your medical data is shared by any doctors you go to in their network so you don&#039;t have to always fill out forms for your medical history each time you go to a specialist (dermatologist, ophthalmologist, etc.)&nbsp; Good luck.
