					Glad to hear Alchemy is picking up steam. A friend of mine dropped in last week and was chatting with Drew, the gentleman that mans the smoker and carves the meat. According to him, he&#039;s being relocated soon to John Brown in LIC, and his replacement at Alchemy will be Josh Bowen himself. If true, this could be mean an even better menu (and if we&#039;re lucky, some new sides too)!!

					We&#039;ve been twice now - once on a Friday, and once on a Wednesday for take-out. We&#039;ve sampled everything but the chicken at this point, and haven&#039;t really had a bad bite of food. The beef ribs are tougher than one would expect of BBQ, but by no means inedible, and that is the nature of the beast, in my experience. The brisket was excellent (we got it both times), the pork ribs great, the sausage nice and moist, the prime rib and lamb belly both tender and delicious. <br /><br />I think the negative reviews come down to a matter of taste, honestly. I prefer a dry-rubbed, smoky BBQ; I rarely use sauce; I like fatty cuts. If someone is used to a leaner cut drenched in sauce, they&#039;re probably going to take issue with the style of BBQ served here. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible, too, that there have been cuts here and there that miss the mark (I haven&#039;t had any, but it&#039;s possible), but I&#039;d be shocked if the chef didn&#039;t replace any piece of meat that was deemed unsatisfactory. He seems to take a lot of pride in what he does, and I imagine he&#039;d be as disappointed as you to find he served a sub-par piece of meat.

					I&#039;d agree with dssjh on the brisket, although everyone&#039;s taste is different, and I&#039;m certain I prefer the fatty end of the brisket, which is what I got the other night. And I thought the cost was commensurate with the quality of food and service I got, but that is probably subjective as well.<br /><br />As for expanding the menu to include sandwiches, just ask... There is free white bread with every order. Depending on how hungry you are, I&#039;d say 1/4-1/3 lb. of any of the boneless meats would make a great sandwich, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;d even prepare it on the bread for you. And, if there is a protein that you want to see that they haven&#039;t had yet, again, just ask. The menu is a big experiment, but they want to please those who might be frequent customers too, so if you want pulled pork, it&#039;s worth a mention to the chef. If he hears it enough, I&#039;d bet we&#039;ll start seeing it show up here and there.<br /><br />Now, the facebook page says they&#039;ll have lamb belly tonight. I&#039;m intrigued enough to go give it a shot... Will report back!

					Haven&#039;t seen it in this neighborhood, but Astoria Bier &amp; Cheese on Broadway and Community Beverage on Grand in Elmhurst are both likely to have it, as their selections are huge. I&#039;d call first, but I&#039;ve seen it at the latter, and both are easy to get to via public transit or car.

					Finally went to try out Alchemy... It was phenomenal! Honestly, some of the best brisket I have had, and possibly the best in NYC. Also enjoyed the prime rib, pork ribs, sausage, and wings. Sides were decent as well. The cole slaw was really tangy and cut the richness of all the meat really well. The beans weren&#039;t your typical, sweet, baked beans, they were savory with no sauce to speak of, almost a bean mash. Very tasty. We were given some prime rib chili to bring home and try, so looking forward to a taste of that today.<br /><br />Ron, the chef, is very enthusiastic about the food he is making here, and really eager to build a solid customer base. He is really embracing the neighborhood, and wants to try lots of new recipes that appeal to and reflect the diversity found in JH. He&#039;ll be experimenting more with sides as well. In general, it sounds like he&#039;ll be testing out more new recipes on the weeknights, so if you want to be the guinea pig (which, based on all the samples he had us try last night, is a good thing), that&#039;s when to go. <br /><br />He also mentioned that their regular hours will be Tuesday-Thursday 6-10; Friday-Saturday 6-11; and Sunday 12-5; closed Mondays. For take-out, you can call in orders and pick them up for now; they hope to be delivering soon, as well as on Seamless and/or GrubHub.<br /><br />This is such an awesome addition to the neighborhood, and I really couldn&#039;t be happier about it!

					I used to live in San Diego, and this was a huge problem there as well. There, it seemed that most of the tenants in these situations were illegal immigrants, and wouldn&#039;t file complaints against their landlords for fear of deportation. Additionally, they were probably convinced (through deception) that the high rents were buying silence from the landlord as well, and so they were doing each other a favor and willing to pay. Very sad indeed.

					Can anyone recommend a parking garage in the neighborhood that allows you to pay by the day? I know there are a lot of monthly garages, but I&#039;m really just looking to park over the weekend in case the weather gets really bad. I live near 74th/35th, but don&#039;t mind a bit of a walk. Any tips would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

					I agree that this intersection is an absolute nightmare, but I&#039;ve always viewed the honking as a symptom, not the real problem. Peak-hour truck deliveries, double-parkers, cars &quot;blocking the box,&quot; and jaywalkers are the real culprits. I think ticketing those four groups heavily would reduce the honking problem dramatically. And restricting hours for commercial deliveries to off-peak times wouldn&#039;t hurt either.

					Taggie,<br />You mentioned you and some others have been picking up street trees to bring to mulch fest... Thought I&#039;d let you know, there is a pile of about 6 or 7 trees on 74th between 35th and 37th, about mid-block on the east side of the street. I saw them on my way to work this morning, and remembered what I had read in your earlier post. Some of them are littered with tinsel and a couple discarded snack wrappers, but should be otherwise usable for mulchfest if you can get to them in time. I&#039;d love to help, but unfortunately have no place to store them.<br />Hope that helps!<br />

					I was pretty ill last spring and my primary care doctor advised me to go to an ER. When I asked if there was one in the area I should go to, the answer was, &quot;no.&quot; I was told to go to NYU or Lenox Hill in Manhattan. She mentioned that Queens Hospital (a branch of Mt. Sinai, I think) in Astoria was one of the better ones in Queens,&nbsp; but if I had to travel that far anyway, it was worth it to just go into Manhattan. For what it&#039;s worth, I was seen quickly and treated very well at NYU.<br /><br />Good luck!

					Jeff, quite the opposite! Hadn&#039;t driven the car since Sunday, when we gassed up north of Stamford on our way back from Boston, and didn&#039;t really intend to get gas any time soon unless there was a good panic-free opportunity that we happened upon, such as only 4 cars on line 2 blocks from our apartment at 11:30 at night. Alas, we will wait until the hoopla dies down, as good citizens who don&#039;t need gas should.

					Coming home along Northern last night we noticed that the line at the Shell was only about 4 cars long, so we thought we&#039;d try to fill up. We drove around the block, and 72nd at 34th Ave. was blocked with a NYPD vehicle. I rolled down my window and asked the officer if we could get past him to buy a little bit of gas (we have 3/4 at the moment, just thought we&#039;d top off if we saw the opportunity). He explained that the station had been designated for T&amp;LC medallions only, and apologized for the inconvenience.

					I saw this yesterday morning when I went to vote and wondered what it was all about. There was a police car managing the line at the corner of 34th and 72nd though, so guessing it might have been sanctioned? And call me crazy, but I&#039;m actually not offended by this guy reserving gas for taxis, sanctioned or not. I imagine cab drivers have been hit pretty hard by the storm, not being able to drive into Manhattan for a few days, and then facing gas shortages a few days later that are lasting over a week now. Their pay structure is solely based on the fares they pick up, and with no access to gas, they cannot work, unlike many of us who have other transit options or can even work from home. Obviously there are exceptions - others whose livelihoods depend on driving to work who were excluded by this station owner - and for them it&#039;s unfortunate and probably very frustrating. But I think taxis are an important part of our local economy and transportation system, and they need gas more than most of us right now.
