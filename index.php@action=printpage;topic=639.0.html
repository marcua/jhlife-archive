				There really aren&#039;t any goopd fish markets in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I go to Marino&#039;s in Astoria (30th Ave.&nbsp; and 36 or 35 Street) for excellent fish.

				I buy from Whole Foods or Trader Joe&#039;s and bring it home, or order from Fresh Direct. I haven&#039;t seen a fish market that I trust. The few fish I&#039;ve bought from the local grocer&#039;s haven&#039;t been that great and it&#039;s really inconvenient. The fishmonger is never at the counter when I want to buy it so I have to find the manager. It makes me think not many people get the fish, so it&#039;s probably not that fresh.

				I&#039;ve gotten some great fish at really reasonable prices from Sea Tide.&nbsp; The one caveat is that not everything looks great on any given day, so you have to go with what looks fresh rather than assuming you&#039;ll be able to find anything you want.&nbsp; However, there have always been a variety that look good so I&#039;ve always left happy.&nbsp; I also got great shrimp with the heads on at least once which were fantastic (shrimp w/heads=very very fresh b/c the heads spoil very quickly).<br /><br />I also really like Marino&#039;s in Astoria, but Sea Tide is more convenient, as I can walk to it or take the 7.

				I just got a very tasty piece of fresh salmon filet at Hong Kong Market in Elmhurst.&nbsp; The price seemed very reasonable but can&#039;t remember exactly how much per pound. From my apartment off 37th ave in the &#039;80s it&#039;s about a 15 minute walk.&nbsp; http://www.chow.com/places/15257<br /><br />I didn&#039;t check the other fish, but I did notice shrimp with heads.<br /><br />In general the fish area seemed fresh and well-stocked with a high turnover.&nbsp; My one problem was that there was a strong odor coming from nearby the fish area of the market.&nbsp; For me it was too strong and I couldn&#039;t identify it. (It did not smell like fish past their prime).&nbsp; I think I determined that it was coming from another aisle which houses things like seaweed salad, tofu, and perhaps some marinated items.&nbsp; It&#039;s probable that certain items I&#039;m unfamiliar with normally produce such an odor and because it&#039;s not something I&#039;m used to, it disturbs me a bit.<br /><br />

				Wanted to get the word out.&nbsp; I was in Compare Foods tonight (Northern Blvd. bet. 86th and 87th) and was very pleasantly surprised at their brand new full service seafood counter.&nbsp; It is rented out by a private party which you pay directly for your seafood.&nbsp; Everything is brought fresh daily from the market and I was really impressed as they had about 15-20 different kinds of fish, 6 different kinds of shrimp, clams, baby octopus, squid etc.. etc...&nbsp; They also have little signs which tell you whether the catch is wild or farmed and its country of origin.&nbsp; Also, the prices are surprisingly very reasonable.&nbsp; As seafood eating Baltimore-born girl, this is a much needed improvement to the neighborhood.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy too!

				I `ve found the fish market inside compare Food on Northen B. and 87th very good. The fish is fresh and the prices are affordable. For best deal pick up a shrimps with head on and wild fish not farmed. Avoid to buy fish already fillet which increase the price and do it on your own.

				I went yesterday to Compare Foods on Northern Blvd &amp; 87th St and was not only impressed with the fish section but with the entire store.&nbsp; What a difference from years back when I lived closeby.&nbsp; It&#039;s much better than the MET Supermarket when it comes to produce, seafood, deli counter and hot prepared foods.&nbsp; They not only have cooked chicken but also cooked turkey drumsticks. They&#039;ve had many owners but the current one is a winner.&nbsp; I wish it was closer.&nbsp;

				You&#039;re welcome!&nbsp; I was surprised when I walked by to see that the inside appears to be all fish, because outside is produce -- and I thought it was going to be another produce place.&nbsp; I guess they wanted to have something on the sidewalk and obviously they can&#039;t put fish out there.

				Thanks for the info, Shelby. They were finishing up the renovation last week, glad to know they are now open for business. <br /><br />I&#039;ll check out the fish aisle. The one in Mi Tierras recently closed, too, so it would be good to have a place closer than the Pacific Market.
