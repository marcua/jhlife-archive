				Hello! I am interested in this unit (#522) but can&#039;t tell from the photos if there is a separate shower stall. I see that the faucet in the tub has a handheld shower head attached to it but also noticed that the tiles only come up partway. Perhaps the shower head could not be mounted because of the window? How likely is it that the adjacent walls and window frame are damaged from water and maybe mold? <br />http://www.coldwellbankermoves.com/property/details/4272906/MLS-2724157/8610-34-Ave-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372.aspx

				Unless there&#039;s been some SERIOUS re design, there&#039;s a shower stall in the bathroom. I&#039;m not sure when/why the shower head in the bathtub was installed, but our apartment has one and pretty much any of our neighbors partments that I&#039;ve been in has one. <br />The 12/22 line has some nice corner windows. We&#039;ve been in the buidling for about 13 years now, we like it.

				We are in the Carlton, and our tub had a shower head even though there is also a freestanding shower.<br /><br />It&#039;s one if the things that made no sense that we rectified in our gut reno.<br /><br />Does anyone know why the practice was to install shower heads on the tubs where there was also a freestanding shower stall ?<br /><br />It&#039;s a mystery to me. And I&#039;d love to understand the rational way back when.

After I bought the apartment, I did the renovation to tile the window frame and the three walls around the tub to the ceiling, and also install a free standing shower head. I did notice the mold and water damage&nbsp; when I used the bathroom a couple of times before the renovation was complete.
