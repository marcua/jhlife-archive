				One huge oak tree chopped down, another one set to come down soon in Travers Park apparently because of planned &quot;park improvement.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />* Please contact NYC Parks. 718-520-5958. Ask for Michael Dockett, Queens Parks Commissioner. <br /><br />We just might stop any further trees coming down if everyone seeing this calls.&nbsp; Let&#039;s deluge them with calls!<br /><br />Councilman Dromm already has contacted parks, but calls from the public to Parks will help support him. <br /><br />Be polite but very firm that they should not take any more trees down without an explanation to the community. Tell them the community was never notified about the removal of these trees. No plan was ever presented to the community, certainly not with the removal of these historic trees. <br /><br />These trees are old and produce huge environment benefits that cannot be replaced by all the new trees they&#039;ve recently planted at the park until decades pass.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t hurt to go to park and tell the Parks arborist there that they need to stop until this is looked into.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen any evidence that there were health problems with these trees, but that can be misleading. Trees could rot from within without evidence from outside. If there is a problem with the health, such as the tree hollowing out, they should be able to show that in the tree already chopped down. <br /><br />Len Maniace<br />Jackson Heights Beautification Group - Tree LC Crew<br />www.jhbg.org&nbsp; &nbsp;www.facebook.com/JHBGNY&nbsp;

				Ugh. I shutter in fear when I see the “tree surgeons”. <br /><br />These butchers get paid to find “sick” trees.&nbsp; <br /><br />What a bummer...
