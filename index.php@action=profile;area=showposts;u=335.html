					<span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><strong>ESPANOL PARA CHICOS IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THE:</strong></span> <br /><br />Arts &amp; Crafts Spanish workshop (Ages 4 - 7)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Our program is intended to help nurture your childâ€™s abilities in the visual arts surrounded by the Spanish language while learning and exploring fine Hispanic art. <br />The Arts &amp; Crafts Spanish workshop will explore all kinds of creative activities and learning opportunities in Spanish.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The session focuses on a specific language theme where skills of drawing, painting, cutting and pasting will help grasp those concepts in a fun and creative environment. <br /><br /><br />The program stresses the concepts of fine Hispanic art and Spanish language immersion. <br /><br />The sessions will explore of the following artists: <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />1. Salvador Dali<br />2. Frida Kahlo<br />3. Pablo Picasso<br />4. Diego VelÃ¡zquez<br />5. Fernando Botero<br />6. JoaquÃ­n Sorolla <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />We will be using the Spanish Immersion Method:<br />Spanish Immersion means that your child is immersed, or surrounded by, the Spanish language during his/her session. In this language immersion environment, when a child is enjoying an activity he/she learns the educational concept and the language at the same time.<br />Since the first class your child will immediately be hearing Spanish words, however, the teacher will utilize English as required to ensure children understand the rules and expectations, get to know their teacher and are made to feel comfortable. Throughout the session, the teacher, when necessary, will show or dramatize what they are saying, however, in a preschool environment virtually every opportunity provides self-explanatory translation and so the children can grasp meanings from their very first day in class. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />About the teacher(s):<br /><br /><br />MarÃ­a JosÃ© PeÃ±aherrera <br /><br /><br />MarÃ­a JosÃ© has had ten years of professional experience in many different areas of&nbsp; teaching and communication including broadcasting, and teaching English, Spanish language and Hispanic Literature to students of all ages. She has a B.A. degree from Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Quito with a major in Social Communications and a minor in Comparative Literature; and an M.A. from Universidad Andina SimÃ³n BolÃ­var in Communications and New Technologies. <br />She is the co-founder of Easy EspaÃ±ol, (<a href="http://www.easyespanol.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.easyespanol.org</a>)&nbsp; a Spanish Learning Center in Manhattan. She is the instructor of â€œEspaÃ±ol para Chicosâ€ a pioneering total immersion Spanish program for toddlers in New York.&nbsp; Born and raised in Ecuador, Maria Jose lives in Jackson Heights, NY with her husband and their&nbsp; 2-year old daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />If you are interested please contact me directly, Monica Maldonado, via email, <a href="mailto:moeandvic@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">moeandvic@yahoo.com</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The summer session begins, Thursday, June 25th through Thursday, September3rd.<br /><br />There will be eleven (11) classes, every Thursday, from 4:00pm - 5:30pm.<br /><br />The classes will be held at the Community Church, 81-10 35th Avenue, Jackson Heights, NY, Classroom #3.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The Schedule will be as follows:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />June 25th<br /><br />July 2nd<br /><br />July 9th<br /><br />July 16th<br /><br />July 23rd<br /><br />July 30th <br /><br />August 6th<br /><br />August 13th<br /><br />August 20th<br /><br />August 27th<br /><br />September 3rd - Last Day of Classes - PARTY!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Depending on how many children register we will have an additional teacher, Kathy Gardner, who has worked with us in the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />The price for the whole summer session is $255.00 plus an additional $20.00 (non-refundable) registration fee for &quot;ALL&quot; students, including returning students, which will cover materials for the classes.&nbsp; Siblings will receive a reduction in price.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Monica Maldonado<br /><br />Director of Espanol Para Chicos, LLC<br /><a href="mailto:moeandvic@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">moeandvic@yahoo.com</a><br />(917) 697-6517<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

In this program, emphasis on accent and pronunciation is reinforced. Literature that illustrates the theme of the class will be displayed as well as didactic material. Occasionally hand-outs are given to practice at home.&nbsp; Previous instruction is not required. Spanish heritage students are welcome too. <br />&nbsp;<br />We will be using the Spanish Immersion Method:<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Spanish Immersion means that your child is immersed, or surrounded by, the Spanish language during his/her session. Your child will enjoy music, books and games in Spanish. In this language immersion environment, when a child is enjoying an activity he/she learns the educational concept and the language at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Since the first class your child will immediately be hearing Spanish words, however, the teacher will utilize English as required to ensure children understand the rules and expectations, get to know their teacher and are made to feel comfortable. Throughout the session, the teacher, when necessary, will show or dramatize what they are saying, however, in a preschool environment virtually every opportunity provides self-explanatory translation and so the children can grasp meanings from their very first day in class. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Teacher:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maria Jose Penaherrera, Co-Founder of &quot;Easy Espanol Inc.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BA -&nbsp; Social Communication and Literature, Universidad Catolica de Quito, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ecuador<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MA- Communications, Universidad Andina Simon Bolivar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solomon Schechter School of Manhattan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7th and 8th grade Spanish Teacher<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full time Spanish Teacher at Easy Espanol Inc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.easyespanol.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.easyespanol.org</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />If you are interested, please email me &quot;off-list&quot; at <a href="mailto:moeandvic@yahoo.com" class="bbc_email">moeandvic@yahoo.com</a><br />and I will send you a registration form.<br />&nbsp;<br />Please note, space is limited and I am only taking 10 students at a time.&nbsp; First come, first serve basis.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif" alt="&#58;D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley" />
