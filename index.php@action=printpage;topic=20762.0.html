				Before this board disappears, I have a favor to ask. If anyone remembers, please ask your landlord, co-op board or owners association to switch from the gas powered leaf blowers to the quieter and less air polluting electric models. I realize there are bigger problems facing the neighborhood, but this seems like really low hanging fruit and something that we can easily influence.

				<strong>2nd this request!</strong><br /><br />A 2-stroke gas engine in a leafblower, which burn oil and gas together amazingly inefficiently,&nbsp; emit as much <em>local</em> air pollution at minimum of <em>dozens</em> of full-sized cars (with catalytic converters) run for the same amount of time. <br /><br /><br /><em><br /><br />The two-stroke engine found in most consumer gas-powered leaf blowers is an outmoded technology. Unlike larger, heavier engines, a two-stroke engine combines oil and gas in a single chamber, which gives the machine more power while remaining light enough to carry. That design also means that it is very loud, and that as much as a third of the fuel is spewed into the air as unburned aerosol.</em>

				We got rid of the gas-powered blower and replaced it with an electric one, which while undoubtedly better for the environment and health of everyone in its radius, is still noisy. Before there were leaf blowers of either variety there was the broom, which is still in use at a number of buildings and continues to work very well.
