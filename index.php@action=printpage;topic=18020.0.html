				The NYC City Planning Commissioner approved a spot zone change yesterday, allowing four extra floors on the &quot;Target&quot; building (the old Jackson Theater) on 82nd Street. Clearly a blatant give-away to the real estate industry (the folks who run NYC.) This building will create a traffic nightmare, jamming up a key ambulance access road to Elmhurst Hospital. And make no mistake, this will be followed up by similar redevelopment of other smaller buildings in the area.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Now the zone change request goes the the City Council where if tradition holds, the Council member in whose district the zone change resides gets the final word. (Francisco Moya.)<br /><br />In this case, however, Elmhurst Hospital sits in Councilman Dromm&#039;s district and some believe he has reasonable cause to speak out in opposition to the zone change. We are talking about the major medical institution for a good chunk of Queens; what&#039;s more a major part of the city&#039;s hospital system. <br /><br />Don&#039;t have time to comment much more now since I&#039;m at work.<br />

				If Katz and Moya support it, Dromm will not be able to block it. I guess big money donations will all the time.

				Jackson Heights resident, attorney, and member of the NYC Planning Commission Larisa Ortiz voted no on the zone change. She made the following comments on the proposal, which would allow the developer to build 13 stories rather than the maximum of nine now permitted. Her main concerns were ambulance access to the hospital and the city&#039;s archaic 1961 zoning revision&nbsp; calls for far more parking than would be needed in an area only one block from the subway. This excess of parking runs counter to the city&#039;s goals to cut the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.<br /><br />&nbsp;<em><br />First I would like to say that I support density - and certainly affordable housing - at transit rich locations.&nbsp; Our city&#039;s robust economic growth depends on supporting a growing population and in ensuring that people of all incomes have healthy, safe places to live. <br /><br />I have two issues with this proposal. The first is not unique to this site. The original 1961 zoning undercuts the city’s sustainability goals with high parking requirements – and then allows even more parking beyond the requirement – all at transit rich locations.&nbsp; As a result, under this rezoning, we will have 120 units and 128 parking spaces (above the required 48) only ½ block from a subway station.&nbsp; I know this zoning text predates all of us here, but it behooves us to revisit it in light our collective OneNYC goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. <br /><br />My bigger concern is the impact this project will have on emergency vehicles to Elmhurst Hospital, a Trauma 1 Medical Center and one of the busiest in the nation, whose emergency entrance is located along Baxter 1 block south of the site. I understand that an as of right scenario would also result in a loading dock at the intersection of Baxter/83nd, however, under the rezoning, we are doubling the size of this development. The commercial alone will go from about 20k sf to over 76k sf, a nearly fourfold increase which will result in more frequent loading/unloading and more 18-wheelers that will need pull forward, block 83nd Street - and emergency vehicles - and then pull back into the dock.&nbsp; And the cars entering and exiting the lot at this same intersection, serviced only by two elevators I might add, will further exacerbate congestion.<br /><br />Add to that the fact that the traffic analysis did not take into account the buses that ring this awkward triangular site. When asked about these routes, the development team wasn’t aware of the routes or their frequency. Nor did the analysis take into account the fact that the street pattern, where two street grids clash, mean that 83nd Street provides the ONLY direct north/south connection for nearly 1/2 mile between 77th and 85th Streets. The traffic study states only that sufficient alternative access is available to the east, south and west. Well, there are over 8,000 people who live in the ten block area directly north of the hospital. For them, those reassurances are no consolation.<br /><br />While the hospital inexplicably chose not to weigh in on this matter, the Uniformed EMT Union did. I wish they had spoken at the hearing. They said this at a recent press event and I QUOTE “There are times this turns into a bottleneck and people can’t get through. We’ve sometimes waited 5-6 minutes to get into the ER. We’ve pulled patients out of the ambulance and walked them in from off the street.&quot; END QUOTE<br /><br />If this project is to advance in its current form, I urge City Council to incorporate restrictions on loading/unloading, reduce the size of the parking facility in line with the city sustainability goals, and require a set aside for car-share vehicles that some studies have indicated replace as many as 15 personal vehicles for every one car-share vehicle.&nbsp; <br /><br />With that I vote no.<br /><br /></em><br />

				Let me understand this: someone wants less parking than 128 spaces provided?<br />Sounds silly. <br />While I agree that the city should lessen the parking requirements for residential construction near subway stops based on the idea that people don’t need a car that does not mean we should reject a project for having too many parking spots.

				My husband sent me this update he spotted on QueensNeighborhoodsUnited&#039;s FB page from July 13th. Looks like they are going for a 10 story structure..which isn&#039;t that still taller than the 9 stories allowed?&nbsp; https://www.facebook.com/QueensNeighborhoodsUnited/<br /><br />&quot;BREAKING NEWS: MILLIONAIRE DEVELOPERS WITHDRAW APPLICATION TO BUILD HIGHER ON 82ND ST!<br /><br />Following extensive community opposition, the developers have WITHDRAWN their application to rezone 40-31 82nd Street. This is a HUGE victory for our community! After more than a year of organizing - in which the community pressured our elected officials and the developers - Sun Equity Partners and Heskel Group announced to the press that they will formally withdraw the application to rezone the site on Monday, 7/16.<br /><br />We will not forget: Despite serious concerns raised by the community, multiple City Planning Commissioners, and Queens Community Board 4 (which voted overwhelmingly against the spot rezoning in March), Council Member Francisco Moya has been a vocal supporter of the rezoning since early May. CM Moya has made closed doors deals with the developers for more so-called “affordable” units in the project and he along with Queens Borough President Melinda Katz have accepted thousands of dollars from the developers.<br /><br />If there is anything we have learned from this campaign, it is that we must relentlessly hold our elected officials accountable - it took almost half a year of organizing to pressure CM Moya to withdraw support from the rezoning.<br /><br />OUR FIGHT IS NOT OVER. The developers have proposed a 10-story building instead of the rezoning, and it is still not for our community. We will continue to fight alongside our neighbors to create spaces that meet our community’s real needs: 100 percent neighborhood affordable housing, support for our immigrant-run small businesses (NOT corporate chains), community space and schools for the next generation.&quot;

				Probably when you run the numbers to build the additional floors combined with the requirements that a certain portion be affordable, the numbers don’t make sense. It is better to build what is allowed without a rezoning. I think their main idea is to get Target open.

				It appears that they didn&#039;t like the conditions set on the affordable housing portion of the expansion. They wanted the affordable housing to be more temporary than the zoners would agree to. Instead, their statement said they will eliminate the affordable housing part of the construction and build a 9 storey building &quot;by right&quot;. Maybe Lenny can verify if this is true. From looking at the rest of Elmhurst, it&#039;s hard to believe that there any zoning restrictions.

				The end result is 0% affordable housing. Great job on behalf of our politicians. 9 stories is plenty tall enough and with a target no less. The politicians get to keep the donations. That will not change.

That&#039;s the real reason entrenched homeowners fight every new development - they want their property values to keep going up.<br /><br />That said, there are valid concerns about this building <em>in particular</em>, like slowing access to the hospital with the 100+ cars they&#039;re inviting to park there.

				Affordable housing is the Mayor’s and city Council’s requirements if you want to exceed what is allowed “as a right” under current zoning. It is not my idea or goal. I personally feel that a building that has a high volume store like a Target should not be allowed to get any bigger because it creates more problems with traffic and deliveries.

				<strong>Queens Neighborhood United</strong> shared this on Facebook this morning:<br /><br />QNU- Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/QueensNeighborhoodsUnited/?hc_ref=ARTrb-QpC-6Ax3_N2lKMmKFLtSJe3qSz5Eb6ncuD3JRwD5Xx6VRMQk8s7vVheSoQs4c&amp;fref=nf&amp;__tn__=kC-R)<br /><br /><em>Family, we’d like to share some exciting news-- <strong>as of August 29th, the Department of Buildings will be issuing a stop work order and move to revoke the permit at 40-31 82nd Street.</strong> See the attached photos of the document signed by the Queens Borough Commissioner at the Department of Buildings, Derek Lee.<br /><br />What does that mean? It means a few things:<br />(1) The Department of Buildings (DOB) confirmed our belief that big-box, department stores like Target are not legally allowed to be tenants at 40-31 82nd Street, based on the city’s land-use laws at the site. Currently, the site only is supposed to accommodate local or small businesses. In spite of this, the developers had been marketing the space as a “regional destination” and “a rare outdoor shopping mall experience in the outer boroughs.”<br /><br />(2) Because the DOB has revoked the permits for the site, the developer’s plans for the site are no longer legal and that means ALL CONSTRUCTION AT THE SITE MUST STOP. If you see or hear any construction at the site, CALL 311 immediately to report a “violation of a stop work order”!!<br /><br />(3) We believe the DOB’s decision for our site may have huge consequences across the city in the fight against corporate chain and big box store takeover. If the DOB believes that sites zoned similarly to ours cannot legally accommodate a big box store like Target, what does that mean for the planned, but unbuilt Targets like those in Astoria and the Upper East Side? What could it mean for Target locations that have already been built, like the East Village location?<br /><br />This decision is a major blow to the plans of the developers, Sun Equity Partners and Heskel Group, the politicians who have been in lock-step with them since day one (Council Member Francisco Moya, Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, and Ari Espinal), and the corporate lackeys at the 82nd Street Partnership who have been fronting like they support small businesses while systematically welcoming corporations and developers into the neighborhood with open arms.<br /><br />We’d like to thank the community members who submitted challenges and supported the research in this, as well as those who have continued to sign the pledge to not shop at the 82nd Street Target, should it ever be built! Stay with us, family, and keep your eyes and pressure on the developers and their minions.</em><br /><br /><br />

				I have to admit that I always thought the zoning there would not allow a big box store like Target to open. What is the zoning there? I believe that the Sterling bank site at 73rd Street and Broadway which is zoned C4-3 would allow a small target to open. Target will probably look at that site next.

				I have to be honest - not jazzed to hear this news. I guess I am of the unpopular opinion that the proposed Target would vastly improve the quality of the block (at the very least aesthetically), potentially offer more jobs to the residents of the area, and even attract more people from different areas to JH to eat/shop/etc. I definitely wasn&#039;t thrilled about 13-story &quot;luxury&quot; condos, but leaving this an empty lot is not a solution and is actually worse for the area.

				I&#039;m not sure the Queens United folks have their facts right.<br /><br />I went to the DOB website and there is no evidence that the project is not going forward. There is a filing showing that the contractor has been fined $2400 and is in violation of DOB rules due to creating excessive debris at the site. The contractor has been ordered to rectify the matter.<br /><br />With regard to &quot;big box&quot; stores, Target and other retailers are opening stores throughout the U.S. that are of a variety of sizes. Some are the standard massive big box stores like you might see in the suburbs. Others aren&#039;t. Target, for one, has been creating smaller stores for urban markets...so to say that Target will be prohibited from building there is incorrect. I don&#039;t see anything in the zoning that prohibits Target. Based on the renderings that have been submitted by their architects it looks like they are planning three floors of commercial. Maybe that&#039;s a big box, maybe not.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a great site for any large development whether it be an office building, apartments or a multi-story retailer. That street is already a disaster.<br /><br />That said, I don&#039;t see why there is such opposition to a Target. The neighborhood needs better stores that offer a variety of merchandise at reasonable prices. Target has a pretty good selection and pretty good prices. But if you disagree you&#039;re free to shop elsewhere. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I believe that in certain commercial zoning groups a store is limited to a certain size of it doesn’t have off street parking. Maybe they tried to get away with a paid parking garage.&nbsp; Having a Target with no off street parking wouldn’t to good for the block or neighborhood.

				To be fair if people who oppose Target trigger or cause a reexamination to see if Target complies with zoning laws, is that wrong?&nbsp; Other landlords who rent to smaller stores have to comply with the zoning laws so why should Target be given an exemption? The main problem is the lack of parking. Both College Point and Maspeth have huge parking lots. I understand that this store is smaller but maybe not small enough to trigger the requirements for off street parking exclusively for the store. Zoning laws are the law.

				This article shows us that all the stores in certain neighborhoods are owned by probably a few Uber rich landlords who can afford to keep storefronts empty. If you can’t rent at a high rent normally you lower the rent till you can find a renter. This has nothing to do with the explosion of Jackson Heights gentrification that is bringing national chains that realize there is a buck to be made in Queens. I don’t see an explosion of empty storefronts in our neighborhood.

I support Target being here in the neighborhood, and at the same time, I did think a 9 to 13 story building would have added too much congestion to an already crowded area.

				I agree there is too much housing in that area. Thank God they scraped the residential tower. Now we can have more in those other ground level retail stores like a 99cent store, a pharmacy, optical and bank which are all are in short supply in JH. The NIMBY’s have won because the Target will be much smaller than originally planned.

				True we don’t have a before and after revision number as to the exact square footage. They just could be chopping up the other retail but I believe it is all related to the off street parking requirements in this zoning district. I believe that the developers may also be building the commercial portion of the project now and then later add the residential tower. It may be cheaper to do it like that. This was done at the Costco in Rego Park.

				Donna, I totally agree with you.&nbsp; I had mixed feelings about a Target until I visited the mini store in Forest Hills.&nbsp; There&#039;s really nothing much there that I couldn&#039;t find in our Rite Aides and local supermarkets.&nbsp; The only thing different I saw was probably the home goods section, but I don&#039;t need to redecorate my apartment that often and I don&#039;t buy that kind of stuff from Target anyways.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; I am tired of all the pharmacies, banks and 99 cent stores, but I just don&#039;t see what the Target will add to the neighborhood.&nbsp;

				The only small Target I&#039;ve been to is the one above the new Trader Joes on the Lower East Side. I liked it. I would welcome it in the neighborhood. One thing I like about Target is their prices, which are generally more reasonable than places like Duane Reade, etc. I also prefer the shopping environment/aesthetics over drug stores. I hope we get our Target!

				We don&#039;t have many shops that sell housewares. There are two in JH on Roosie. <br /><br />I bought my toaster oven at 8903 Roosevelt. There&#039;s also a housewares dept upstairs from a cosmetic shop somewhere below 82nd on Roosevelt. <br /><br />I also buy stuff in the City. I almost never shop online. It would be nice to have one other option nearby.

As I&#039;ve said in other threads, QNU is a hateful group who somehow claim to represent the views of the Borough, even though they have like 5 members. Go figure.

				i&#039;m agnostic about having a Target in the neighborhood. i like the chain&#039;s politics, i like their efforts to hire locally, but i probably won&#039;t shop there because they don&#039;t really have much for sale to draw me in. if i lived closer to the location -- 81st or 83rd street, say -- because i&#039;d be directly impacted by increased traffic. it&#039;ll be interesting to watch it play out.

				Article from <strong>Crain&#039;s New York Business</strong>:<br /><br />Queens developer swamped by progressive wave (https://www.crainsnewyork.com/features/queens-developer-swamped-progressive-wave)<br /><br />July 08, 2019 07:00 AM <br /><strong>Daniel Geiger</strong> <br /><br />Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trashed his project, his local city councilman turned on him, and his state senator along with a neighborhood community group sued him.<br /><br />Queens real estate developer Heskel Elias says he has a tale to tell about his attempt last year to construct an apartment building in Jackson Heights with affordable units and a Target store on its ground and basement levels.<br /><br />While the project might seem innocuous in a city short on low-income apartments and retail outlets catering to price-conscious shoppers, it instead drew fierce opposition from a progressive wave that has focused its ire on corporate and real estate interests.<br /><br />Elias, a longtime Queens resident, a developer for more than 30 years and a political donor known for his deep pockets, was forced to retreat from his plans for the development at 40-31 82nd St., a block from the 7 train.<br /><br />As a result, he and his partner in the project, Sun Equity Partners, are proceeding with a revised plan that doesn&#039;t require any zoning changes and will house offices and medical suites instead of the residential units, with the Target store anchoring the retail space.<br /><br />That scaled-down version of the development continues to draw bitter opposition as well as a lawsuit from state Sen. Jessica Ramos and the community group Queens Neighborhoods United.<br /><br />Despite spending more than $1 million on planning for the failed apartment building, including fees for lobbyists, architects and lawyers, what troubles Elias more than the lost time and money are the blows he says he has suffered to his reputation from elected officials eager to cast him as a villain at a moment when real estate interests have become a target of populist anger.<br /><br />Elias gripes that his experience is an example of how that shift has stifled debate over the merits of real estate development and persuaded more moderate elected officials, fearing political backlash, to abandon projects like his.<br /><br />&quot;In politics, in order to shine, you need to find an enemy you can bash,&quot; Elias said. &quot;And I was the perfect person at the perfect moment.&quot;<br /><br />Elias said that just over a year ago, he counted Councilman Francisco Moya, a Queens Democrat and former state assemblyman, as a key supporter. The two attended a meeting in early 2018 to discuss the proposed apartment and retail building with the chairman of the local community board, which was opposed to the development.<br /><br />&quot;Moya was advocating for us,&quot; Elias said. &quot;We would have never gone ahead and spent $1 million on the planning of this project if he hadn&#039;t given us encouragement.&quot;<br /><br />To raise the 13-story, 120-unit project that Elias envisioned, he needed to rezone the site to boost its allowable square footage. Mayor Bill de Blasio has encouraged developers to seek such modifications under the city&#039;s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which grants added bulk in exchange for guarantees that 25% to 30% of a project&#039;s square footage be reserved for affordable units. MIH has been a core component in several of the de Blasio administration&#039;s rezonings. Given its proximity to the 7 train, Elias&#039; building was also in line with the prevailing belief among city planners that added density should be granted to sites close to transit.<br /><br />Left turn<br /><br />But the political winds soon began shifting for Moya. Ocasio-Cortez, then campaigning for the House of Representatives seat long held by Joseph Crowley—a political mentor and ally of Moya—expressed stinging criticism of Elias&#039; project at a community board meeting in March 2018, a precursor to the kind of anti-development rhetoric she used to help scuttle Amazon&#039;s proposed Long Island City headquarters.<br /><br />In November Ocasio-Cortez toppled Crowley, ushering in a progressive wave in city and state politics and dealing a major blow to the Democratic Party machine that had cultivated Moya&#039;s political career.<br /><br />&quot;AOC created a totally different atmosphere,&quot; Elias said. &quot;Everyone went into their hole.&quot;<br /><br />To try to undercut the growing criticism, Elias pledged to offer even lower rents for about half of the project&#039;s 42 affordable units to make them suitable for renters earning the area median income of around $47,000 a year.<br /><br />By then the developer was midway through the city&#039;s uniform land-use review procedure, a seven-month approval process that ultimately would give Moya power to green-light or block the project.<br /><br />Elias said he also struck a deal, at Moya&#039;s behest, to employ higher-paid union building workers, including doormen, porters and maintenance staff, at the property. But flak from vocal opponents, including Queens Neighborhoods United, continued to dog the project. The critics labeled it a symbol of gentrification in a working-class neighborhood with a large population of immigrants—despite the fact that economists and planners have largely discredited the notion that stifling development curtails rising rents. <br /><br />&quot;If a developer is coming into a community and is building housing that is not affordable to that community, they are bringing in a different wealth bracket,&quot; said Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, an organizer for Queens Neighborhoods United. &quot;That is a harbinger of displacement.&quot;<br /><br />The opposition group, which was founded in 2013 to represent immigrant interests in neighborhoods such as Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Corona, took issue with the fact the affordable apartments, no matter how low the rents, would be out of reach of most undocumented residents because the city&#039;s affordable-housing program requires applicants to have a Social Security or Taxpayer ID number.<br /><br />Caught in the middle<br /><br />Elias said he received a phone call from Ramos, who was then running for state Senate, just after the 2018 Fourth of July holiday. Ramos told him she was rejecting a campaign donation of $14,000 that Elias had given her for her Senate run, and she would donate the contribution to a charity providing relief to detained migrants at the border. Her campaign later said that it had given the money to the Hispanic Federation.<br /><br />&quot;We had support from Jessica Ramos. She had her hand out to us, and we contributed to her campaign,&quot; Elias said. &quot;She told me she wanted to donate the money to the border. I said, &#039;Not a problem.&#039; She could do whatever she wanted with it.&quot;<br /><br />(A spokeswoman for Ramos said she never supported Elias&#039; project.)<br /><br />Later that day Elias said he received a call from his lobbyist, former City Council Speaker Peter Vallone Sr., who told him that Moya had called and angrily declared that he was cutting off his support because Elias had spoken with Ramos, whom Moya had previously warned him not to discuss the project with.<br /><br />&quot;Moya told me, &#039;I don&#039;t get along with her, and if you communicate with her, all bets are off,&#039; &quot; Elias said. &quot;But I&#039;m not hiding from anyone. If she calls me, I&#039;m going to speak to her. I&#039;m not going to fall between two people who pretend to hate each other.&quot;<br /><br />Moya denied that assertion.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t even know how to respond to that,&quot; Moya said. &quot;I have a good relationship with Jessica. People will say whatever they&#039;re going to say.&quot;<br /><br />Moya offered a different description of his falling-out with Elias. He claimed that he had asked the developer to enter into a binding agreement with the city&#039;s Department of Housing Preservation and Development that would have formally bound Elias to deliver the cut-rate units at deeper affordability levels. Elias never consummated the agreement with HPD.<br /><br />&quot;This is a guy who has been incapable of telling the truth,&quot; Moya said. &quot;It has nothing to do with progressive politics. When someone is being disingenuous, that&#039;s not something that I&#039;m going to tolerate.&quot;<br /><br />But some planning experts questioned Moya&#039;s explanation, pointing out that he could have made the lower affordability levels a requirement of his approval for a portion of the apartments without the involvement of HPD.<br /><br />Without Moya&#039;s backing, the rezoning proposal never came to a vote in the City Council, and the project was scuttled.<br /><br />In his conversation with Crain&#039;s, Moya sought to distance himself from his initial support of the development. &quot;This is a project I inherited from a predecessor,&quot; he said, referring to former Councilwoman Julissa Ferrara.<br /><br />Shortly after, Elias abandoned the residential component and pushed forward with a 2-story retail and office building spanning roughly 100,000 square feet, with the Target still in place, that could be built as-of-right under existing zoning rules.<br /><br />That didn&#039;t quell the project&#039;s opponents, and a temporary stop-work order was issued in September by the city&#039;s Department of Buildings at the behest of Queens Neighborhoods United. The opposition group, along with Ramos and other plaintiffs, then filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court to challenge the presence of the Target, arguing that the site&#039;s zoning precludes a department store.<br /><br />Target plans to open a roughly 23,000-square-foot urban concept store at the site, smaller than its normal big-box locations, that the company and Elias have described as a &quot;variety store&quot; in planning documents—a designation allowed under the site&#039;s zoning.<br /><br />The lawsuit contends the store, regardless of type, is still larger than what is allowed. Zoning for the site prohibits stores in excess of 10,000 square feet. The Target skirts that by locating the bulk of its space in the property&#039;s basement, floor area that is not counted under city zoning rules—a technicality that the lawsuit challenged.<br /><br />The case was dismissed earlier this year, as was an appeal to the city&#039;s Board of Standards and Appeals. The plaintiffs are now appealing the lower court decision in the state&#039;s Appellate Division.<br /><br />Kaufman-Gutierrez insisted that the Target would drive local businesses under. She said a store near Elias&#039; project recently closed, with the proprietor reporting to her group that the landlord had raised the rent $3,000 a month because of Target&#039;s pending arrival.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the advocacy group conducted a street survey of what it says the community would like to see built on the site. The top four responses: a park, a senior housing complex, a 100% affordable apartment building or a community center for youth and worker programming.

				The activists are complaining that it’s a “destination” store. It’s not! It’s a MINI Target. Anyone who’s been to one would know it’s too small to be a destination, especially when there are two really large full size Targets close by that are easy to access by public transportation.

				Seems pretty clear that the zoning says nothing more than 10k sq feet is allowed, and they are putting 23k place in. Their argument is that it&#039;s underground? huh? So if it was on the 2nd floor, would that be fine?<br /><br /><br />It is a shame though that people seem to have to be handcuffed not to go to stupid Target.... I&#039;m personally okay with taking the train a few stops if I need the stuff. Just went to Aldi yesterday and it was excellent. We already have plenty of stores for anything, and you can buy Target stuff online. <br /><br /><br /><br />I do think that the group is a little clumsy but at least they are fighting for the neighborhood.

I personally wish that they would fight/put their energy towards more constructive things. For example, it looks like they are the main backers/supporters of Centro Corona, which is a community center for youth. They also fight to protect street vendors. I have mixed feelings on the latter, but I would argue that both are examples of where QNU puts their energy towards positive change. <br /><br />This constant animosity towards Target, Sunnyside Yards, etc., in my opinion is not a positive use of their time. How about they start contributing to solutions to some of the real issues we face - trash, criminal activity on Roosevelt, lack of youth programs, helping the community through career counseling, etc.? Oh right...they don&#039;t want gentrification. So they&#039;d prefer to fight not to have anything change.<br /><br />You know they actually said in opposition to Amazon that &quot;these jobs are not for us?&quot; That is such TWISTED logic when you think about it. Why wouldn&#039;t a youth from the neighborhood be eligible for a corporate (or other) job? I seriously did not like their message after that - so negative.

				It is a well established zoning rule that basements and cellars are not considered square footage for purposes of calculating the floor area maximum that can be built on any piece of property in NYC. Also mechanical space doesn’t count. This whole lawsuit is a complete waste of time and should be thrown out. So 10k is on the first floor and up.

Folks are 20-25 years too late to stop rents rising there...that&#039;s when it was rezoned I believe.&nbsp; &nbsp;And that&#039;s the neighborhood that would&#039;ve been affected.<br /><br />The kids of immigrants could aspire to being able to afford the &quot;high life&quot; in LIC. <br /><br />The American Dream.

				Would love a target here... I grew up nearby with the target in Elmhurst and it was great! One within walking distance will save time plus there are plenty of brands I can buy that the local stores here don’t carry. I don’t expect this to happen, but if it brings a touch more safety and cleanliness to Roosevelt, it wouldn’t be the worst thing.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Also being told what stores we are allowed to have and where we can and cannot shop in our own neighborhood is VERY annoying. <br /><br />And UNdemocratic in spirit. <br /><br />I&#039;ve said it before...the will of the people will manifest in how and where they spend their money. <br />Not how and where they are &quot;forced&quot; to spend their money. <br /><br />

				Now that the Target has been opened for a while, I see zero signs of any effect on the neighborhood&#039;s mom and pop stores.<br />Despite the previous predictions of &quot;doom and gloom&quot; on this thread.<br /><br />It appears to have simply added to the choices available for where folks spend their $&#039;s. <br /><br />Besides that, another brand new Target type store (Dollar City) has just opened on Roosevelt Ave in competition with Target.<br /><br />There seems to be an endless demand for inexpensive &quot;stuff&quot; in Jackson Heights ...what with the current expansion of D11 on Roosevelt as well. (Plus there&#039;s the online shopping revolution too)
