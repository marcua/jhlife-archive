			Florsheim&#039;s was the store on the corner of 82nd and 37th. I remember waking early that day (summer time?) and smelling fire. It was only later, when I came home from work that I saw what happened. It took years before the litigation regarding the height of the &#039;new&#039; building was settled, and although arson was suspected, nothing was ever proved.<br /><br />This was a real low point as that block was the cross roads of the &#039;old&#039; JH.<br /><br /><br />

			I remember the some of the shops, not the fire itself and then that area being a gigantic fenced off pit for the longest.<br /><br />I remember a Hallmark and a bakery. I also remember when they were constructing the building my friends and I would get inside and throw snowballs off the roof onto the people below.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />The &#039;new&#039; building is completely out of scale and really fucked up the quaint look of Jackson Heights.

Oldst yle, they sold all types of film, developed pictures, and repaired cameras. <br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />Yes there was and I can&#039;t recall the name of it. They were one of the last places in New York City that repaired Super 8 projectors.

			I recall that between the two fires (the first having only taken out two thirds of the stores), the Hallmark store that did survive had its in door a sign (handmade, all signs were ... this was 1980s) saying something to the effect of &quot;WE WILL NOT MOVE.&quot; and asking for witnesses to the (first)fire.
