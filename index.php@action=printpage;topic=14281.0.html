				I just completed the three-hour TNR training with the ASPCA that is required before you can rent humane traps and have access to low-cost spay/neuter surgeries. There are two cats in the back area of my apartment building (on 75th, between 37th and 35th) that I&#039;d like to trap. I&#039;d prefer to work with a partner, and was wondering if there&#039;s anyone in JH that has done trapping before. Anyone available to brainstorm and/or help?

				Hello. I would like to help you with this trapping attempt. I am TNR certified but have yet to do my first project. Feel free to email me.

				I tried to feed the cats two days in a row, and not a bite was eaten. I can only presume that they have a home base somewhere nearby, but I don&#039;t know where. I saw a third cat yesterday (smaller gray and white). The cats seem to use the back area only as a pass-through. They yeow really loudly, but don&#039;t stay very long. The black cat and gray-and-white cat were in the area last night for about 45 seconds, chasing each other. I can&#039;t even begin to trap until I can get them to eat in the yard. I live on 75th between 37th and 35th. Does anyone know if there&#039;s some place in particular these cats may spend most of their time? I presume I&#039;ll need to try to trap there instead, if the homeowner or building management will let me. <br /><br />Any ideas on the best way to track where they may spend most of their time? I&#039;m getting more and more stumped on how to help them. No less determined, but a lot more stumped. Or should I continue to put out food in the hopes that I can start to attract them here to stay longer so I can eventually trap them?

				Just in case you want to get moving on TNR with cats -- I live on 81st just below 37th, and there is a big colony of black/gray/white cats. They are beautiful animals -- or were last time I actually saw any of them -- so I think someone is feeding them. It&#039;s most likely a different group, since 75th is pretty far away. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been talking to a group in Woodside about TNR for almost a year (every 4 months or so), but they haven&#039;t gotten to our neighborhood yet given the cat population there.<br /><br />It is OK with our super -- I would have to ask again, since it has been a long time since I asked.<br />

				With regard to food choices for enticing strays, you might try tuna or any other strong fish.&nbsp; Sometimes that works.&nbsp; Ideally find out who is the feeder and work with him/her.&nbsp; Also, the ASPCA clinic in Glendale gets very very busy in the Spring, summer and fall so if at all possible now would be a good time to trap, if the weather permits.

				I TNR&#039;ed almost all of the cats behind my building two blocks away from you. I&#039;m assuming you made sure yours don&#039;t already have the tell-tale ear tip, right? Chicken baby food works like a charm. But you need to make sure that there&#039;s only chicken and water in the food or they can get really sick. They can&#039;t resist it. Either that, or get some roast chicken to put in the trap.&nbsp;
