				Wow! If the antibiotic stuff wasn&#039;t bad enough, check out what we&#039;re doing to these animals in the name of our plates. &nbsp;I see all these restaurants in Jackson Heights and I&#039;m fairly certain their chicken and pork isn&#039;t heritage breed, blah di blah but more like the stuff in this article.<br /><br />http://www.springerlink.com/content/p811p18540937037/fulltext.pdf (http://www.springerlink.com/content/p811p18540937037/fulltext.pdf)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 8pt;" class="bbc_size"><em>moderator note: split from Food Coop thread.&nbsp; OP - send me a message if you want the thread re-named.</em></span>

				This is sick behavior, in favor of maximizing profits....all the more reason not to consume factory-farmed animals.

				I am a big supporter of organic, grass-fed beef and no-antibiotic, free range chickens and eggs (partly because they are like ten times more delicious than the conventional stuff). And I&#039;m conscious about not buying depleted seafoods (like tuna and wild salmon). But it&#039;s very expensive for the consumer and unfortunately those small, caring farmers don&#039;t get much support from the government. It&#039;s sad to say that a lot of people don&#039;t really care how their cheap meat gets into the styrofoam containers at the supermarket. Especially in this neighborhood, where a lot of families are on a budget.

				We would all be healthier if we ate much less animal protein than the average person in this country does.

Unfortunately, a lot of people have never had proper nutrition education. It&#039;s sad that processed foods with chemicals and high fructose corn syrup are so cheap, fast and easy. In our neighborhood, there are so many ice cream trucks, sweets shops, fast food places (we have two McDonald&#039;s!), and restaurants that serve canned/frozen vegetables, if any at all. And not one place to get a healthy salad. Those Starbucks drinks that are 24 ounces of caramel/cream/sugar/preservatives don&#039;t help either.
