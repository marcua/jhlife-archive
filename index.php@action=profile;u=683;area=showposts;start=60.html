					The Jackson was one of four movie houses in Jackson Heights in the 50s. The others were The Earle(now the Jackson Heights food court)The Boulevard on Northern at 82nd St. and The Colony on 82nd between 37th and Roosevelt What a time it was for movies. The admission wasn&#039;t much,the lobbies were kept clean and there were ushers and matrons there to keep some semblance of order. The format was a double feature that is an A film and a B picture thrown in, a cartoon , and of course coming attractions.<br />Every time I passed The Jackson over the last years of its decline I felt that I was seeing a grizzled old veteran that had seen better days and was now in its dotage. But who knows maybe like some long ago Hollywood ending the old Jackson will leap out of the grave to live again. One can only hope.

					I was a stick ball player in the 50s and the Yard was where I played. We had a chalked up strike zone in the middle wall where I mostly played. On the longer wings of the Yard there was also stick ball played but for some reason we mostly played in the middle, the Ebbetts Field of the Yard. There was also some strange variant of stick ball played on the hand ball courts where the ball was slow pitched against the wall. I can&#039;t remember the rules and how we avoided knocking the ball into 77th St. I played with Doug Ehrhardt a lot, Richie Neubauer sometimes and whoever was passing through and wanted a game. The pink Spaldeens were mostly what we used but occasionally we tossed the more expensive tennis balls that made for the possibility of a curve. If you got a hold of it though you could literally knock the cover off it. That was a shortlived pleasure because that was ususally the end of the game.We played thorough the summer and the Mission soda and YooHoos from Moe and Archies kept us hydrated.<br /><br />I went to a street festival some few years ago that celebrated NY street games. There was an exhibition street stick ball game- the kind played in the street where the pitch was on a bounce which I never much cared for but it was good to see it being reinvented even momentarily. There is a documentary about NY street games that incorporates some of the events which included Johnny Rides a Pony, War, and Salugi to name a few although I suppose that it starting another thread.<br /><br />As to the &quot;rocks&quot; I remembered Richie Rubino who was tough but not menacing. Kevin Young though was the worst sort of bully and 60 years have not dimmed my detestation of him. <br /><br />Thanks Nagelberg for the reminder and speaking of Nagelberg were there any games played at 145 other than handball?

					<br /><br />I didn&#039;t know that the names Polk and Hayes were the origin for 37th and 35th Avenues. I still would suggest that they are plausibly the names of two former presidents. What either name has to do with Jackson Heights or Queens or even New York is the open question if my theory is correct.

					<br />I had a gentle reminder of a thread about the old bars of Jackson Heights none of which I really knew as a school boy in the 50&#039;s. An exception was the Blue Haven on 37Th and 73rd. which I passed on my home from Boy Scout meetings at PS69. The Blue Haven was I guess a bar but we thought of it as nightclub and latterly I heard that Lennie Bruce played there in his early days. <br /><br />Still it was the thread about the quartet of movie houses that piqued my interest . Many thanks to Nagelberg(how many of us left who get the reference?) who reminded me of the old matrons dressed in white with their flashlights in the children&#039;s sections. The Saturday mornings were exactly as described with the endless cartoons, the serial and the cowboy film. The Earle was the best of the bunch particularly its superb deco interior which I have rhapsodized about in previous posts. I had forgotten about the movie star pictures in the Colony and the Boulevard&#039;s association with science fiction films resonated with me. I think it was also the theatre that played House of Wax in 3-D. Or was it Creature from the Black Lagoon?The Colony&#039;s only real association for me was that I first tried smoking there while watching an old forgotten Tyrone Power film called Abandon Ship.The movie centered around a a life boat in a rolling sea.Why my first fumbling attempts to get through a pack of L&amp;Ms&nbsp; didn&#039;t make me a nonsmoker i will never understand as I was thoroughly sea sick by the end of the movie. A fringe benefit of both the Colony and the Jackson was a deli not very far from the Jackson which sold Kosher hot dogs with as much sauerkraut as you wanted for 15 cents.<br />The Polk (named after an underappreciated President?) was a last resort,rarely used and a bridge too far for anyone I knew.<br />There is one remaining movie house that still maintains the 50&#039;s feel at least in its exterior and that is the Fair on Astoria Boulevard. It only shows Bollywood films now. The 49 bus takes you right to it.<br /><br />With that can we move on to stickball in the PS69 playground?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

					For someone like me who spent every week in the old Earle Theatre(now the sad old Eagle) watching Saturday morning serials and then as I grew up older foreign films, the forlorn state of this surrounding area is heartbreaking. For those who never knew the Earle it was a little gem with a dark&nbsp; green and crystal thirties lobby and a devoted audience. As I recall it was the smallest of the theatres in Jackson Heights both the now gone Boulevard and the hanging in there Jackson both had double or triple the capacity with only the Colony on 82nd St having anything like the intimacy of the Earle. The once great Earle is now the dead, dying decrepit Eagle with the area around it similarly uncared for. <br /><br />So if&nbsp; there is a moral arc to this story&nbsp; not only would there be a pedestrianised islet at the descent to the subway, providence might also allow for the Earle to be revived and become if not exactly its former self at least a cleaned up and welcoming venue for films and community events. Is there even a slight hope that something like that might happen?

					<br />I lived on 72nd Street between 35th and 37th in the 50s Around the corner and down the hill was a two fisted beer and Four Roses drinker&#039;s bar with blacked out windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;. It is now Pearsons where at least five years ago you could get the best pulled pork or ribs in NY. <br />Back in the 50s for us it was just another stop on the way to the &quot;lots&quot; and snake hill the best place in Jackson Heights to sled down those twists and turns until you reached the point where your American Flyer ran out of steam.<br /><br />So what was the name of that bar which seems to be overlooked in everyone&#039;s lists?

					Just a very quick follow up to my meanderings about JHS145. <br /><br />There was a school song sung to the tune of the Woody Guthrie classic &quot; This land is my land&quot;<br /><br />The words were: This school is my school, this school is your school-our Junior High School 145- We&#039;ll sing it loudly ,we&#039;ll sing it proudly- THIS SCHOOL WAS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.<br /><br />Now is where it gets hazy- something, something &quot;our happy school days will fade away but we will something something &quot;remember fondly this school was made for you and me&quot;<br /><br />Anyone out there remember the full verse?and is it still sung? Although not I hope with the dead weight of the IS145 name.

I have been an ex-pat for years so I haven&#039;t lived through these changes. <br /><br />I hope there was some plausible reason to remove old Pulitzer&#039;s name from the title although I honestly can&#039;t think of anything that would justify this act of municipal vandalism.&nbsp;

					It&#039;s been fun renewing the old memories of Jackson Heights. Just a few more from me.<br /><br />PS 69 in the 50&#039;s was run by the saintly Dr.Jaffe who as others have pointed out was Rona Jaffe&#039;s father. PS 69 in those days had a wonderful array of teachers. The ones I remember were Mrs.Tuckman, Mrs. Brock,Dr.Plover. Mr. Isby(more about him after the list) Miss Leddy and Miss Speary. There was also a music teacher who tried to teach violin overlooking the school yard at 3:30. An impossible task. That wall with the box with the big S in it said forget the violin lesson and play stickball.Her name was Miss Birdseye and I lasted maybe three lessons<br /><br />Mr. Isby I notice is shown in Jr. H.S.145 list. I&#039;m sure he taught at PS69. He could be very strict at times but we liked him anyway. He had a habit of throwing chalk or erasers at kids who were talking in class. I also remember him challenging the class to a race in the PS69 school yard for some reason that is lost in time.<br /><br />Mrs. Brock was a teacher whose husband was an FBI agent. He was killed in the line of duty. I thought for while that it was an urban myth but if you persevere you will find the sad story of Harry Brock on the internet.<br /><br />PS 69 had two annual events-the cake sale and the Bazaar. The cake sale was where parents would bake cookies and cakes and then sell them for the school&#039;s benefit. The Bazaar was where lots of things got sold again for the benefit of the school. <br /><br />The first friend I had in that school was Arthur Nadle who I remained friends with for over 50 years until his untimely passing some years ago.<br /><br />I suppose there&#039;s always the temptation to give these old recollections more of a shine than they deserve but it was a great old school with dedicated teachers and a wonderful atmosphere that I still recall with affection.

					<br /><br />&nbsp;I have very fond memories of the Jackson in the 50&#039;s. An enormous hall with the well remembered children&#039;s section and the stern matrons with flashlights to find children who had sneaked into the adult seats. A big candy counter and stairways leading up to the high balconies. Yet it wasn&#039;t the grand style of the Jackson and the Boulevard theatres but rather the lowly Earle and Colony theatres that are the one&#039;s I remember best. The Earle used to have colored flyers that kids would collect for a free or discount admission to the Saturday show. It was as always a cartoon, a serial(the last one I saw was Dick Tracey versus the Claw or was it Crime Inc. ?)then followed by a kid friendly double bill of a cowboy film or science fiction film and maybe Francis the talking mule or Ma and Pa Kettle. <br />I mentioned in another posting the wonderul interior of the Earle. All dark green and crystal. I went back to visit it some few years ago when it became the Eagle(why on earth change the name?) and the Indian management kindly allowed me to have a look round although clearly dumbfounded that anyone would be interested. The interior had been gutted-nothing remained of it. Even the subdued lighting that I remember was replaced by bright lights. So what remains of the Earle is the E that starts the Eagle which if I am right is the&nbsp; only hint of what was before the Eagle had landed.

					I discovered this site in the way you find lots of things on the internet as you get pin balled around looking for things. I was actually looking up the history of the old Physicians Hospital where my brother was born and found this site and the discussion of the &quot;old Jackson Heights&quot;. I put that in quotes because a lot of the references seem not so old to a semi old guy like me. <br />Anyway I loved living in Jackson Heights and intend to move back in the next two years after 35 years in London. So what do I remember about growing up in the 50&#039;s. Stickball in the streets(touch football too) and playing in the&nbsp; PS69 schoolyard.Walking along 37th Ave was it the A&amp;P between 73rd and 74th where they ground coffee up at the counter. Dr. Price the dentist on 73rd.opposite the Blue Haven nightclub(smoked windows made it always seem dangerous)The Hamburger Express where the hamburger came on electric trains.the tiny specialty candy store on 75th St and 37th that was run by Arthur Landau&#039;s parents.Wechsler&#039;s on 75th St and 37th where the door opened to the glorious smell of smoked fish, apricot leather, pickles and cheese. The classic &quot;appetiser store&quot; The old public library that predated the 81st St. library. It had the story lady every Sat. morning and was located where the supermarket is now between 76th and 77th. and it was where I learned about books. Funny that there is a little reminder of it with the second hand book man nearly on its old site.<br /><br />Of course the Toddle House which was a little place on the corner of 77th&nbsp; leading to Moe &#039;n&#039; Archies candy store(now a Korean grocery) where stick ballers would get Mission&nbsp; grape or cream soda or Italian ice. It had a long counter where if you were feeling flush you could get a malted made in chrome cylinder&#039;s plugged into a whizzer.The Post Office-thankfully the same as always with its NRA mural. Fields where I got my boy scout uniform. Smoked my first cigarette in the Colony balcony watching a Tyrone Power film about a ship wreck. That combination nearly put me off smoking but I persevered and was confirmed at Pulitzer Jr. High and even more at Bryant H.S. Moving along 82nd to the Jackson there was a little deli that sold 15 cent hot dogs before you saw the double bill. Of course my favorite was the Earle theatre with a classic art&nbsp; deco aquarium interior.(gone gone gone) Saw Sat morning serials there and followed it as I got older when it played foreign films. It did become a grind house showing porn films after I left with a small link to its community past with a sign that said &quot;discounts for senior citizens.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway I could go on. I feel privileged to have lived in Jackson Heights in its glory days. A wonderful place that happily despite all the demographic changes retains something of the old spirit.
