				Does anyone know where I can properly recycle my huge collection of plastic bags? I&#039;d rather not have to carry them into the city if I don&#039;t have to. The Duane Reade on 82nd used to have a collection bin but they got rid of it for some reasonâ€”and I got the sense they were just dumping it in the trash anyway.

				Rite Aid on 37th Ave. between 82nd &amp; 83rd Sts. has a collection box in the 83rd St. entrance.&nbsp; d.k. what they do with them though.<br /><br />Madalyn

				That&#039;s good to know about Rite Aid.&nbsp; I once took my plastic bags out looking for a supermarket with a collection box.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t find one.&nbsp; I ended up at Mi Tierra and asked &quot;do you take plastic bags for recycling?&quot; and they said &quot;sure, we&#039;ll take them.&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s possible they just put them in the trash for me, helpfully relieving me of the guilt.

				I take mine to the Foodtown on 37th between 76th &amp; 77th. There&#039;s a bin at the front windows, behind the registers.

				Food Town takes them - they have a bin near the end of the cash register line.&nbsp; By law, all grocery stores must take them for recycling.&nbsp; Mi Tierra on 81st and Northern did not have one when I asked this past year and I told them they were required to do it - but I doubt my saying anything made them get one.&nbsp; Not sure where to call to complain or if it was worth the trouble.&nbsp; Just take them to Food Town or Rite Aid.

				CVS on Northern and 89th had recently removed its plastic bag recycling receptacle. A store clerk told me they weren&#039;t accepting bags anymore and that they just throw them away anyway. It may very well be that the State plastic bag recycling law is not being enforced. <br /><br />The stores hate this law. Many stores allow their containers to remain full, probably to discourage more recycling.<br /><br />I would welcome more and better options. Can we get some new suggestions? I would schlep them into the city if I have to.<br />

				Rite-aid on 37th Ave has a box at the 83rd Street entrance. I leave mine there, It seems to be regularly cleared but I don&#039;t know what actually happens to them.<br /><br />Noticed a large bin at the C-town exit today, don&#039;t remember seeing it before.<br /><br />Walgreen used to elegant little bins by the doors, but they seem to have been long gone.<br /><br />

				Any reason why we can&#039;t just reuse them for something else. I usually just bring it to the supermarket to resuse it or mostly I just use it as a trash bag.

				I take mine to the Home Depot on 23rd Street in Manhattan.&nbsp; The bin is right by the entrance (just to your right as you enter), and I put them in my trunk and drive them over on the weekend when I drive into the city.&nbsp; At least there, I know they get recycled.

I end up with a ridiculous number of bags because every cashier is trained to double bag everything, even toilet paper. I reuse bags a lot for my household garbage, but I still have excess. Being able to recycle them is helpful to stop the plastic bag monster that grows under my sink exponentially some weeks.
