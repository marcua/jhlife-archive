Maybe if you owned a car and drove these city streets as I do, you&#039;d be more aware of all the pedestrians and cyclists who ignore their own safety, common sense, and the rules of the road, placing themselves and others in danger.<br /><br />Just curious if the NYPD keeps data on tickets given to cyclists and pedestrians? Maybe more enforcement there would help, no?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is quite true. I own a car but don&#039;t use it very often. The amount of times a pedestrian just wandered into the intersection against the light as I&#039;m coming to it consistently takes me aback. There&#039;s been a couple that have stared me down as they are doing it like they aren&#039;t the one doing something wrong. There&#039;s enough blame here to go all around for making mistakes whether intentional or not. I&#039;m hyper vigilant when I&#039;m driving, but there&#039;s not much I can do about people who don&#039;t also follow the rules or think they can just bend them if it seems safe to.

					I like how people are suddenly caring about noise when those of us that live on 37th have been dealing with the sound based torture of talentless buskers playing the same 5 songs over, and over, and over again (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">it&#039;s a military torture tactic</a>...), 10 different garbage truck outfits making noise all night, the beeping trucks at the post office all night, I can swear it just sits there sometimes not moving just beeping for an hour or so.. but no one seems to care about stuff like that until their NIMBYism kicks in when it&#039;s about to hit you personally.. <br /><br />I definitely can empathize with those people that live on 34th who are staring down a potential noise source, especially on a 100% residential street. Usually these open streets are lined with cafes etc..

I don&#039;t remember how to do it, but we used this database extensively when looking to buy and we were narrowing in on which apartments and buildings we liked enough to consider an offer on.

I know one or two units closed in my building last summer at prices that suggested they went in to contract before the Covid shutdown, and since then there&#039;s been a price slump.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think people generally were paying less for NYC real estate since 3/2020. It would be interesting to see a trend if we truly go back to normal and 34th stays open. We&#039;d probably need at least 2 years of data through 2022 for it to mean anything though. Actually probably tack 2023 spring/early summer on there.

It also looks as if there&#039;s still parking in the main hero image. The one thing that seems to be common there that doesn&#039;t exist for this stretch of 34th is that most of the street level seems to be business and cafes where for JH it&#039;s all residential. We just have to hope the culture for people to do it properly and with care will emerge.

Her for obviously needing some sort of mental health assistance, you for having to deal with it. Hopefully something can be done to help everyone involved.

Legal / Police might be your only option. Maybe against both the tenant and the mgmt company not doing anything about it.

					I hadn&#039;t noticed this when I posted in the other thread. Indeed seems like a good summary of all the things I was thinking about. When it was talked about as a &quot;park&quot; I had the assumption that the intersections to Northern would be closed off to thru traffic. That seemed like a definite non-starter. It would be pretty much impossible to realistically conduct life in that scenario. The logistics of that seemed like a recipe for constant frustration. I would imagine most people who own a car in the hood actually need them to get to work or other valid reasons, and there&#039;s no convenient transit option for them (or I would imagine they wouldn&#039;t want the expense of the car in the first place). The thought of this being permanent sounds great on the happy path sunny sky where real life isn&#039;t getting in the way, but it&#039;s going to be a net burden for a lot of people that live in the hood or commerce to the hood (deliveries / emergency vehicles) I would imagine. I&#039;m still super skeptical this should live on permanently.

					Is there somewhere to go to read about the proposed detailed plan for this? I see this as a net negative for the entire neighborhood but I don&#039;t want to make any assumptions without seeing what the proposed plan is for how this is supposed to actually be operationalized.

					I use Astoria Auto Repair, always been very trustworthy and fair prices. <br /><br />49-14 25th Ave, Woodside, NY 11377<br />(718) 728-8060<br /><br />Guy named Frank owns it, we&#039;ve been taking our car there for 12 years. He used to be on 28th Ave in Astoria but the landlord sold the building and he moved to the new location about 3 years ago I guess, which is great for me since it&#039;s (long, but I&#039;ve done it many times now for inspection/oil change and a heater repair) walking distance from JH!
