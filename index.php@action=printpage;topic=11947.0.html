				I have a mourning dove who wakes me up all the time with his cooing. He likes to hang out on top of my air conditioner and is pretty loud.&nbsp; But I feel like we are buddies now - he no longer flies away when I stick my head close to the window and talk to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also hear mockingbirds a lot - but thank god the one who tortured me when I lived in Brooklyn didn&#039;t follow me to JH - he used to mimic car alarms FOR HOURS.&nbsp; I hated that stupid bird.<br /><br />It would be nice to see some robins and cardinals but my building doesn&#039;t have a garden so I never see any cool birds.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Up around 87th we have robins, cardinals and something that looks like a finch. Last summer there were a few wild parakeets around, but the coolest thing so far was having a big hawk grooming himself on our fire escape....<br />

				Don&#039;t know what we have down here at 80th &amp; 34th; only hear them never see them.&nbsp; Only know the crows who live across the street and wake me up at 7.&nbsp; Saw the hawk on 79th St;&nbsp; saw a gray squirrel defending it&#039;s turf against a crow.&nbsp; Having grown up in Brooklyn, I wouldn&#039;t know what they were even if I saw them.

				I&#039;ve seen cardinals &amp; bluebirds and probably other types of birds I don&#039;t recognize. One time I found the remains of a crow on our fire escape, presumably eaten by a hawk.

				Been hearing/seeing quite a few warblers around Jackson Heights over the past week. Northern Parulas (lots!), Black and whites, Blackpolls, Black-throated Blues, Ovenbird and even a Magnolia.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a very birdy spring!

				I live in one of the garden complexes and we have robins and cardinals.&nbsp; The male cardinal sings every morning.&nbsp; It is quite beautiful.&nbsp; We used to have blue jays a long time ago, but not now.&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve seen a hawk too. Last summer he (or she) was here with two others, which I assumed to be its parents, because they seemed to be feeding him/tending to him--even though he was bigger than both of them. Then, earlier this spring, I saw him (or a totally different hawk) hanging out on the top of PS 69 alone. This is a (very low quality) pic of the 2013 hawk waiting for his companions to return.<br />(http://i.imgur.com/F5kGNXI.jpg)<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed more song birds this year--I hope they stick around.

				There is a baby parakeet on 78 street. Does anyone know who it belongs to or how to catch it?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think he will survive very long outside

				Oh, how sad!&nbsp; If he&#039;s tame, he might be willing to land on a stick held by a person (probably not a finger).&nbsp; If he&#039;s not tame, I doubt anyone will be able to catch him.&nbsp; Poor thing probably won&#039;t make it too long.
