See kendro.org (http://www.kendro.org/) for more information. The main page has information in Bangla, and another page (http://www.kendrousa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=41) has information in English.

Doesnâ€™t PS 69 frequently host community events? I donâ€™t imagine the Board of Education expects donations from not-for-profits in return.

				Non-profits are usually the only types of groups allowed to utilize public school facilities.<br /><br />Please be aware, this is not a free-ride, they must pay for the use, and on many frequent occassions they must also pay the overtime rate for school safety to be present to secure the building.<br /><br />While it is unlikely that any proceeds from the mentioned event will be given to P.S. 69, they will almost definitely be compensated for the use of their building.<br /><br />With the extreme budget cuts in our city schools this is now becoming a more frequent occurance, so that schools can generate additional funding.<br /><br />On a personal note, the group organizing this festival is a wonderful group of people that I have had the honor of knowing for many years, and are one of the best new cultural organizations in the area, this is not a promotion on my part, just my observations of some great contributors to our neighborhood.

				&quot;I have no idea as I am not an organizer of the event. OK<br />Because the kendro is a not-for-profit group and the school is government-funded, I would think not. &nbsp;OK&#039;<br />Because there is no price information on the Web site or on the flier that was placed under windshield wipers on 73rd Street (how I found out about the event), I am presuming the event is free so not likely to bring in much if any proceeds, certainly not enough to bankroll new computers for the school. OK<br />Doesnâ€™t PS 69 frequently host community events? OK<br />I donâ€™t imagine the Board of Education expects donations from not-for-profits in return. OK&quot;<br /><br />Response:&nbsp; I just thought that because the school, as all schools, are in need of more funding and as an activity is being held on the premises of the school (P.S. 69) there would be a contribution to the school. &nbsp;Whether or not it is enough to bankroll new computers, perhaps not. &nbsp;But one never knows. &nbsp;The board of education obviously is not bankrolling this particular school or many of our public schools with enough money to purchase everything that a school, which accomodates 1,200 plus students needs, therefore, whoever plans the activities should consider planning activities that will bring in a contribution to the PA for P.S. 69, so that they can have some extra cash to provide some new books and new computers and whatever else the teachers and kids needs to get a better education.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that it will be a great event and that monies will be exchanged on some level.&nbsp; Of course, I guess my question is who will receive the monies and will it benefit the needs of the teachers and the children of P.S. 69.&nbsp; Or are the monies given directly to the board of education fund.&nbsp; Legitimate question as my children attend the school and I don&#039;t know how this exchange takes place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy the Festival!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for posting; this looks great. Didn&#039;t see any times listed on the English site, though. So, if anyone happens to know the sitar recital might be, let us know; I&#039;ll do the same. Otherwise I&#039;ll just hope to drop in at an opportune time!

The flier I have indicates the festival will begin tomorrow at 20:00 (and I wonâ€™t be able to attend). It says the musicians â€œwould perform during the evenings of 11th &amp; 12th October,â€ but doesnâ€™t specify the time. Perhaps the same time?
