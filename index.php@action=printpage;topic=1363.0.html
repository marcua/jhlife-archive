Before the fall semester begins, almost any day would be good for a lunch date. (After that, only certain days will be good, but lunch dates will still be quite possible.)

				I went there with the hubby for lunch today and had their buffet.&nbsp; It was more expensive at $11 but it was excellent food.&nbsp; Their version of saag paneer was better than anything I&#039;ve had in the neighborhood.&nbsp; They had mostly a veggie selection with maybe 3 meat dishes.&nbsp; The dessert looked like the rice pudding (?) I&#039;m used to, but it turned out to be a soft cheese that was even better than the rice pudding I expected.&nbsp; Hubby agreed it was pretty good food, but he is still partial to Indian Taj.&nbsp; I think this is my favorite spot now! We went at 1pm and there were maybe three other tables that were occupied.&nbsp; Even though it&#039;s got two entrances, I&#039;m a little worried this place will close down before people discover it.&nbsp; They also have a takeout section, which I will probably make use of every so often after work.&nbsp;
