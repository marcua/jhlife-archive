				I noticed this the other day as well. High hopes! They just need to look at how well Arunee is doing (appears to be doing anyway) in the spot on the next block and take some inspiration from that. :)

				I have.&nbsp; Went last night.&nbsp; Really nice environment--dug the changing colored light motif the dominate one of the walls--and very friendly.&nbsp; Went for a pretty simple first test--sushi and sashimi combo, edamame, seaweed salad, sake--and thought everything was really good.&nbsp; Fresh, tasty, well prepared.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to get overenthusiastic and say it&#039;s the best Japanese food I&#039;ve ever had but it seems a slight cut above the local competition.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be curious to try some more adventurous fare next time.&nbsp; And, of course, to see what the rest of you think.&nbsp;

				I agree with cultarist&#039;s assessment.&nbsp; The sushi is cut a bit more generously than at Tomo, but you&#039;ll pay more than $1 a piece here.&nbsp; The quality of everything we tried was excellent.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d rank this slightly better than Tomo but still not quite up to the level of TJ&#039;s in Sunnyside.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood!<br />

				I had salmon don and my husband has Chirashi. Not as good as TJ but the best I have had in JH and I would order again, it was really good, I think TJ&#039;s gets to my house faster even though they are in Woodside and Okawa is a block and a half away.&nbsp;

				Since this has turned into a debate about best Japanese/sushi in the area - where does Happy Kitchen fall in this debate.&nbsp; I&#039;m a big fan of them, but I haven&#039;t tried the Woodside place or Okawa yet.

				I wonder if we will ever get a real Japanese restaurant with a Japanese sushi chef.&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; None of the Chinese-run Japanese places here satisfy my craving for good sushi.&nbsp; I would rather go to Katsuno in Forest Hills.

				We finally ate at Okawa last night. Not bad. For the price it was worth going. They aren&#039;t bad or fantastic, I&#039;d say slightly above average. They have a decent selection of special rolls, I would go back to try a couple others.

				Any more experiences with the new sushi restaurant.&nbsp; Was going to eat in last week, but the restaurant was pretty empty and the dark decor didn&#039;t seem inviting...it reminded me of Tomo (although not sure if there is a fish tank).&nbsp; I will try calling in...but when I eat at a sushi restaurant I like a nice sushi bar and some ambience.&nbsp; My go to place is usually Watawa on Ditmars and recently tried Takesushi in Sunnyside based on reco here.&nbsp; Both have delicious Sushi.&nbsp; The neighborhood places are good for delivery.

				we had a very nice dinner there last week -- sushi and sashimi, no cooked dishes. really good eel preparation, excellent naruto rolls, which are hard to come by sometimes. we went in around 8:30 or so and it was about half-full (or half empty, depending on your POV :) )<br /><br />&nbsp;surprised to hear questions about the &quot;dark&quot; decor after so many folks complain about the fact that we have so many bright/fluorescent-lit places and not enough &quot;nice&quot; looking eateries.

				To be honest, the dark and neon lighting of the place reminded me of most of the places in the area.&nbsp; Even the brightly colored Open sign.&nbsp; It was a turn off to me.&nbsp; It feels clubbish, which is like a lot of Roosevelt Ave places.&nbsp; It fits but it&#039;s not my thing.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a big sushi person but when we go, we usually eat at Happy Kitchen, and when I lived in Astoria, I would go to Watawa.

				I tried it tonight. Not bad. Delivery was fast. Sushi was ok - better than Tomo, but not as good as I&#039;ve had elsewhere. Cooked food about the same. I will likely order from them again. <br />The only thing I didn&#039;t like was that I ordered from seamless and they charge an automatic tip. I would much rather tip the guy in cash so that I know he gets it. Next time I&#039;ll probably just order by phone.

				That&#039;s true for some restaurants, most that I use anyway, but not for all. (For example, Black Thai has no mandatory tip.) I may try them on eat24 instead, or just call. <br /><br />This is definitely what I would call a &quot;first world problem.&quot;&nbsp; ;D

				Okawa is a disappointment to me. The quality of sushi/food isn&#039;t bad, but it&#039;s on par with East 21 Boy and substantially more expensive than them. I feel like the opportunity for a high quality Japanese restaurant in JH was wasted. Happy Kitchen is a superior neighborhood option, unless the seating is necessary.
