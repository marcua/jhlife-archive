				Been enjoying the outdoor weekend sidewalk ceviche stand on the corner of Roosevelt and 80th for a while now but the newly opened weekday counter inside is fantastic.&nbsp; I just tried the fish empanada and it blew my mind.&nbsp; They slice an empanada right there before your eyes and load it up with seafood, avocado, cilantro and onions and it tastes delicious and surprisingly light.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the article I saw yesterday that lured me down, somewhat like those smoke fingers in the old cartoons.&nbsp; <br /><br />http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2014/06/la-esquina-del-camaron-brings-seabass-empanadas-tostadas-to-la-roosie/

				Really good, right?&nbsp; I believe they mostly do the sidewalk thing on the weekends but during the weekdays, you gotta step inside and go to the counter in the back.&nbsp; And even if, like me, you usually avoid the empanadas (more often than not, deep fried, tasteless, boring), these are worth trying.&nbsp; Slices that baby right up in front of you and stuffs it with all kinds of goodness that will light up your taste buds.&nbsp; Man, this place is good.

				I tried the fish empanadas and I regret only getting two. They are really delicious! While I was waiting, several people were eating the octopus and shrimp cocktail which looked very interesting. I will try that next time. Thanks for the tip, cultartist. I&#039;m not sure I would have noticed this on my own.

				We tried the mixed cocktail and the empanadas Saturday. Both were terrific - the fish was flaky and tender and the empanada itself was nicely textured. The seafood in the cocktail was also quite tender and the avocado/hot sauce combo played off the base mixture very well. This was absolutely perfect for a summer afternoon. We will be going back for more soon.<br />&nbsp;(http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d23/BlackshirtPower/Food/LaEsquinaDelCamaronMexicanoCocktailSmallest_zpsc99e9780.jpg)

				Went here yesterday for the first time... Great food, great find. And only $2!

				Right there on the Southeast corner of Roosevelt and 80th.&nbsp; Not marked at all.&nbsp; In the back of the bodega, you&#039;ll find the counter.&nbsp; Step right up and enjoy.&nbsp; On the weekend they have a stand on 80th just South of Roosevelt.&nbsp; They make the ceviche right there and it&#039;s mighty good.&nbsp; But on weekdays, just the counter in the back.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;ve been having trouble locating exactly where this is on 80th St. and Roosevelt. <br /><br />North or south side?&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it inside of a Bodega?&nbsp; If so, what is the name of the bodega? <br /><br />&nbsp;Based on the reviews, I want to recommend this place to someone I know who is currently writing a Queens culture guide. But I need to try it first! Or, barring that locate exactly where it is! <br /><br />Thanks<br />

				It is in the back of the seemingly-no-name bodega on the southeast corner. Again, best empanada ever. We&#039;ve also had the octopus taco and shark flautas - good, but no empanada!&nbsp;

				Finally made it to La Esquina de Camaron. We planned to get the shrimp and octopus cocktail (it&#039;s &quot;Shrimp Corner&quot; after all) but were distracted by the taco options:<br /><br />We went with one fried fish taco with cilantro, chopped raw onion and a wedge of lime, and one grilled fish taco with soft carmelized onions and lime. The salsa for the table was nice and hot in a fruity/peppery kind of way.<br /><br />It was delicious and filling lunch for two for $6, plus tip and the price of a soda bought from the bodega up front.<br /><br />We&#039;ll save the cocktails and empanadas for a refreshing lunch on a hot day -- looks like we have one coming up tomorrow&nbsp; :)

				I finally went over there this afternoon and bought a cocktail, shrimp and octopus mixed and it was delicious!<br /><br />I asked for a large thinking it was one of the quart sized &quot;soup&quot; containers they had out (so I can share as a meal with my husband) but&nbsp; it ended up being the next size down (16? 20? oz cup). Rookie mistake on my part, since now I&#039;d love some more.<br /><br /><br /><br />
