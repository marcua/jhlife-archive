			My other advice if you&#039;re looking to protect yourself is to get a great mask that fits you. If you want to try out different kinds, there&#039;s something called the N95 Project. https://www.projectn95.org/<br /><br />I also read a bunch of advice from various people and ended up with this one, a KF94 in large https://www.amazon.com/BOTN-Protective-Safety-4-Layer-Adjustable/dp/B0947MJHFC<br />It seems pretty good and gets good reviews but I&#039;m not an expert :)

			One more suggestion - if you&#039;re looking for a home testing kit and can&#039;t find one to purchase anywhere, I read they are supposed to be giving out the home test kits at every NYC testing site. You can find the list here https://twitter.com/votejgr/status/1472965042563952642?s=20<br /><br />Check the poster - but there&#039;s one on 37th Ave and 104th St., one at NYCHA Woodside on Newtown Ave, and on Wed. only there&#039;s a pop up at the Queens Museum. What&#039;s unclear is if you have to wait on the same long lines if you only just want to pick up a home test.

			Hi folks, I went to get tested this morning at Elmhurst Hospital (corner of 77 &amp; Broadway) and they were handing out Binax rapid tests to folks in line. If you just need a rapid test (which are hard to find in pharmacies these days) and not a PCR, this is a good option.
