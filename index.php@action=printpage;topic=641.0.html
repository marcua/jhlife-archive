				There&#039;s a great little cluster of Filipino restaurants along Roosevelt Avenue just on the other side of the BQE.&nbsp; Has anybody explored over there?&nbsp; I would imagine that they&#039;ve all been struggling a bit with all of the construction that has been going on over there.<br /><br />Today, Pinkabet Detective reviews Ihawan (http://pinakbetdetective.blogspot.com/2008/03/ihawan-bbq-takeout.html).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been there and it&#039;s quite a scene -- a big room packed with big families.&nbsp; No frills, just cheap and yummy grilled meats.&nbsp; I really liked it, although its upstairs location has prevented me from returning with a stroller, so I haven&#039;t been back in a few years.&nbsp; Lately I&#039;ve been enjoying Perlas ng Silangan.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what folks on Yelp have to say about the Filipino restaurants (http://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=Queens%2C+NY&amp;cflt=filipino).&nbsp; &nbsp;What do you think?

				Curious if anyone out there has a suggestion on any good Filipino restaurants in the area ? I know there&#039;s a few on Roosevelt Ave. near 69th St. But am not versed enough in Filipino cuisine to know what&#039;s good and what&#039;s bad.

				I&#039;ve been to both Renee&#039;s &amp; Ihawan for take out most often BBQ (Pork &amp; Chicken).&nbsp; I have limited knowledge of Filipino Cusine.&nbsp; However, I met someone who is from the Phillipines and his favorite is Engeline&#039;s at 58-28 Roosevelt Ave.&nbsp; This is also a favorite of a couple that I know who have enjoyed this type of cusine for years and have been to most of the Filipino Restaurants in the area.&nbsp; Do a search.&nbsp; When you search see if you can find the Restaurant Review that Gothamist did around mid 2007 with photos soon after the restaurant opened.&nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you get other responses.&nbsp;

But for months, the Filipino-American community centered in Woodside, Queens, has been eagerly awaiting the opening of a Filipino food-chain restaurant called Jollibee, and describing its dishes in breathless, almost reverent tones.<br /><br />â€œThis is the taste of my childhood,â€ said Emma Ilagan, a 36-year-old customer service representative for Verizon Wireless who left the Philippines when she was 21.<br /><br />â€œUntil now, you have to go to California for Chickenjoy,â€ she added, referring to the chainâ€™s popular dish of fried chicken, gravy and rice.<br /><br />Or as Natasha Starkey, a conservatory student, said last month when she dropped off an application for a part-time job, â€œThis is Filipino soul food.â€ <br /><br />Jollibee, the dominant fast-food chain in the Philippines, where it has more than 600 outlets, is opening the restaurant, its first on the East Coast, this weekend. Its fare is a mix of fast-food staples like burgers and Chickenjoy, along with more regional dishes like smoked bangus, or milkfish â€” a national symbol of the Philippines â€” served with vinegar and pepper.<br /><br />While Filipino-Americans on the West Coast can enjoy these dishes at two dozen Jollibee locations, those in New York have been able to only reminisce about such items. But in late December, an image of the chainâ€™s cheery mascot, a smiling bumblebee sporting a toque, was mounted over the doorway of a former Mexican restaurant at 63rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, in the shadow of the No. 7 elevated.<br /><br /><em>[Click above link for entire article.]</em><br /><br /><br />

				So that&#039;s what the fuss was all about!&nbsp; I passed by Jollibee on Sunday and had no clue why there was a line snaking around the entire block for a fast food chain that I&#039;d never heard of!&nbsp; There were more kids/teens than adults and they were holding a flyer.&nbsp; Hmmm...maybe they were giving out a free lunch.

				There was an article in yesterday&#039;s <strong>New York Daily News</strong> about ethnic fast food restaurants that have found a niche in Queens&#039; diverse neighborhoods.&nbsp; One of the restaurants, is a popular Filipino bakery called Red Ribbon Bake Shop, located in Woodside.&nbsp; Bakeries always get my attention, so I googled Red Ribbon and found a site, Red Ribbon BakeShop (http://www.redribbonbakeshop.us/index.html).&nbsp; The site revealed more than sweets.&nbsp; Apart from the usual bakery stuff, Red Ribbon also sells empanadas and pork buns.&nbsp; Has anyone tried this place yet?<br /><br />In multi-ethnic Queens, fast food joints reach overseas for cuisine (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/01/25/2010-01-25_in_multiethnic_queens_fast_food_joints_reach_overseas_for_cuisine.html)<br /><br />The above article also makes mention of Wing Stop, a specialty chicken wing fast food restaurant that plans to open in Astoria.&nbsp; I assume this one is American.&nbsp; So fast food joints in general seem to be hot in Queens.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the site for Wing Stop (http://www.wingstop.com/default.aspx).

				Thanks for this info.&nbsp; I walked by Red Ribbon twice, once just before the grand opening, and then a few weeks later when I noticed it was packed!&nbsp; I was surprised at how fast business picked up for a new place, but now it makes more sense knowing that there were probably many people in the area already familiar with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are there any really great chains in the countries that our neighbors here in JH are from that we should try to entice to open up here?&nbsp;

				Second on Tito Rad&#039;s...the food there is really good.&nbsp; Terrible location (at the ugly intersection where Roosevelt veers off from Queens Blvd), but not far away.&nbsp; I can recommend the avocado shake and bitter melon with beef, but have had several good dishes there.
