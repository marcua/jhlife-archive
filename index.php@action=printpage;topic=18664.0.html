				these were released today. <br /><br />one includes a soccer stadium -- which will probably be paid for by taxpayers, i&#039;d guess -- and one has a lot of residential components.<br /><br />haven&#039;t digested the concepts, really, but it would take a LOT of infrastucture work to make residential use feasible (there&#039;s almost no real sewer/water there, among other things).<br /><br />any thoughts?<br /><br />https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/city-releases-two-willets-point-proposals?utm_source=breaking-news&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20190117&amp;utm_content=hero-readmore

				The city already has installed new sewer and water lines but does not allow existing businesses to hook up to them. I think allowing schools and housing is not a good use of that valuable land next to a new Airtrain. Probably a hotel and soccer stadium would be acceptable. The city will push for housing which needs police,fire and schools. I can’t imagine that.

				&nbsp;A soccer stadium makes perfect sense there! It is a huge sport among the local population drawing players and fans from a <br />number of continents. It might just be the thing that provides more unity in our area and could be another wonderful emblem <br />for what makes Queens great.<br /><br />&nbsp;And a players academy -the system most countries have that does not use one year and done practice like the NBA and NFL<br />often does - for young athletes looking to play professionally. Our young soccer players have terrible conditions compared to <br />other sports in the area. The iron triangle is isolated by highways and the housing needs that would accompany that seem <br />daunting. Other areas along the water and closer to Flushing hubs seem like a much more feasible location for new homes<br />with the requisite amenities.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;All for the soccer stadium!!

				i think it would be the perfect way to use the land -- my only red flag is the potential for corporate welfare, a la the Yankees ripping off the taxpayer for their parking garage ponzi scheme, etc.

				Since the Citifield stadium is nearby, it does make some sense to have a sports quarter @ Willets Point. Like a soccer stadium.

				They should put the soccer stadium on the other side of Citi Field where there is now a vast wasteland of surface parking.

				Hotels next to the stadiums would make sense. I don’t believe this area should be used for housing.

				I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if that area were turned into a superfund site.&nbsp; Is it even appropriate for housing of any kind?
