				Due Fratelli pizza on 37th and 76th seems to be down for the count. passed by a couple times earlier this week and the gate was down, but i thought it was just another DOH shutter -- they&#039;ve had a couple. but today, the first time i&#039;ve been by in daylight, i peeped in, and the place looks to be in the gutting process -- coolers pulled out, booths gone. not my fave place by any means, but still sorry to see a dining option removed from the mix.

				Just a couple of my own observations:<br /><br />When the place became Due Fratelli (formerly Giulietta) it seemed to be run by a pair of due fratelli which is Italian for two brothers. They started off with a bang. Several months later the name changed to Due Frankie and I didn&#039;t see the &quot;fratelli&quot; anymore. An Indian guy was now there all the time. The name change was reminiscent of the Earle Theater becoming the Eagle. I think the guys tried to sell or lease the business.<br /><br />Things seemed to go down hill. Then the &quot;fratelli&quot; were back and things sort of picked up again but maybe not quite to where it had been. A little while later the guys were again. <br /><br />The &quot;fratelli&quot; by the way I believe are Russians, and run another pizzeria on Queens Blvd. in Forest Hills.

				good observations,&nbsp; beech.<br /><br />i think all of the iterations were several steps below Thomas, the name when i moved into the immediate area back in &#039;96. that guy was great, and his pies were top notch.<br /><br />i do prefer Gustosa, on all levels, especially his Sicilian pies.

				I heard that the owners are renovating and putting in a brick oven.&nbsp; Believe it or not, I never patronized them because they park several of those motor bicycles completing covering the tree surrounds that people work so hard on to beautify 37th Avenue. I hope that whoever is working in the space takes consideration to taking care of the outside.

				Looks like they are back.<br /><br />I just noticed tonight that the place reopened, not sure when that happened. I didn&#039;t notice any signage but one of the workers had the Due Fratelli T shirt on. I saw a brick oven and the place looked very nice, including a new storefront. Let&#039;s see if the food is any different.<br /><br />I hope whoever put the place together gets more commercial work up and down the avenue.

				Had dinner here last weekend.&nbsp; Not too bad.&nbsp; I think they&#039;re still working out the kinks in terms of seating/waiter service.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty lax.&nbsp; Prices are on the high side and they charge for tap water which was weird.&nbsp; But the food was good.&nbsp; The chicken parm was very tasty and comes with a lot of sauce.&nbsp; One tip - don&#039;t sit in winter.&nbsp; Every time the door is opened, a huge draft blows in.

				Went in the other day - it looks completely different! I couldn&#039;t believe it was the same place. They say it&#039;s the same owners, which is kind of a disappointment b/c I&#039;d like to see it completely renewed. Looks great though.

				I must say I am grateful that the owners &quot;polished the turd&quot; since most businesses in Jackson Heights do not even bother.&nbsp; One downside is that the ex-Park Slope stroller set has staked out this place and have taken over (at least at lunch today) similar to Espresso 77.

				I am entitled to my opinion, which is based on our experiences over the last several years - not one instance.<br /><br />How long you have lived in JH, or Queens, for that matter is completely irrelevant to how good or bad a restaurant is..

				wait, they now CHARGE for deilivery?<br /><br />let me save you the trouble. pizza has soggy crust, sauce with a strong resemblance to tomato juice and a weird predilection for toppings that don&#039;t belong together on pies. <br /><br />pastas are undercooked and served swimming in meh sauces. <br /><br />but they now have nice lighting fixtures. <br /><br />woo.

				I stopped going to gustosas after witnessing the older gentleman in there touching money, a dirty rag and his head then touching the pizza. No thanks!!! I have yet to find good pizza in JH . Years ago Giannis was the best but went downhill then changed owners. I really want to open my own Italian place. I&#039;ve had family members in the business but don&#039;t know at my age if I need a career change and a business is a lot (24/7)of work.

				I&#039;d have to agree with Joopy on this one. Louis&#039; anti-appetite TV turned my stomach so--I think it was wrestling or boxing--that I haven&#039;t returned. <br />I think that if they got rid of the TV (TVs that is; isn&#039;t there more than one?), they wouldn&#039;t attract the hangers-on that sprawl themselves out on the seating and yell at the screen. <br />Not my place at all.

				I&#039;m actually so glad someone else expressed ambivalent feelings about Louie&#039;s! They&#039;re pretty much touted as flawless on this board and on yelp, so I was pretty shocked by how unappealing the experience was when I visited.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, the pizza was pretty good, but it wasn&#039;t exactly worth the unwiped tables, loud music, and the outpatient club of Elmhurst Hospital. <br /><br />

				ick.<br /><br />but not surprising. everything I&#039;ve had there has been unappetizing. pasta dishes swimming in water, pizza swimming in oil. gave them a chance with the renovation, but nothing has changed.

				If no one has tried Rocco&#039;s they have good pizza. Delivery area to JH is small since they are kind of far. So if you do order and they delivery to you, don&#039;t do the jerk thing and order $10 of food and give them a $3 tip. It&#039;s a haul to come this far and I feel privileged that they trek it. I think they appreciate that we order a decent amount of stuff and tip well.
