				Anyone else notice the bit of guerrilla artwork at the Manuel de Dios Unanue triangle near the 82nd st. station? (Photo attached). I love little urban interventions like that -- it critiques the park while at the same time improving it (the plywood it&#039;s painted on also acts as a sort of bench, protecting one&#039;s rear end from the metal spikes that I guess are meant to discourage loitering). <br /><br />The triangle was listed in NYCGo&#039;s JH tourism section as a &quot;green space&quot; to visit (http://www.nycgo.com/slideshows/must-see-jackson-heights-queens-nyc/10/). I have to say, if I were from another neighborhood and decided to visit this &quot;park&quot; based on their recommendation, I&#039;d probably be a little disappointed (unless that Andean musical trio happened to be playing -- then it&#039;d be worth the trip, but only then). Anyone know who&#039;s responsible? JH&#039;s very own Banksy? My hats off!

				Does anyone know if the &#039;islands&#039; in the middle of 34th Avenue are still considered &#039;Parks/Green Space&#039; by the Green Space counters (not sure the agency).<br />When we were 50 out of 51, the penultimate un-green neighborhood that was before the Play Street and Rory Staunton Field, correct? Have those numbers been updated?<br /><br />Is there a realistic date for the greening, i.e., grass, trees, flowers for those areas?

				Think about those rules for {when parkland is taken away, it must be replaced by just as much park space} - like what they wanted to do in return for the soccer stadium in Flushing meadows park... Every time a pol mentioned that, I just visioned areas much worse than Manuel del dios triangle, such as what you see on Atlantic Avenue with a bench on a traffic island and the &#039;park&#039; at Broadway / BQE over here. Yes, lots of public space is a joke. This particular triangle is ridiculous how they have the guards on the wall so no one can sit there. I actually took part of it off which I could with a screwdriver, but need a stronger tool to get most of the rest off.
