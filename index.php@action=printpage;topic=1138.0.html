				We are long time Thaison supporters, first in Chinatown and then when they opened here. The problem however with all of the Vietnamese places in New York, they seem to all be focused around southern Vietnamese, so if you are fan more of the central or northern specialties, its harder to find. But their Pho broth is so far the best in the area.

				I finally made it to Thai Son for dinner last night.&nbsp; Very yummy!&nbsp; The place always seems crowded, but not so crowded that you can&#039;t get a table (unlike the popular Pho Bang (http://eatmeouttahere.blogspot.com/2008/06/vietnamese-pt1.html) in Elmhurst, where you can wait a long time for a table).&nbsp; &nbsp;And their menu is more extensive than many other Vietnamese restaurants I&#039;ve been to.<br /><br /><br />

				For someone who loves most Asian foods, I have never fallen for Vietnamese.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that style where you have raw meats and things brought to the table and you cook it yourself?&nbsp; I had that in the City, I think in the 30s off Ave. of The Americas and didn&#039;t like the spices.&nbsp; Is that it?

				I find Vietnamese food a lot lighter-tasting than other SE Asian cuisines.&nbsp; There are noodle soups, grilled meats, and always lots of sprouts, fresh herbs, rice noodles, and amazingly yummy fish sauce.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely worth trying again.

				I was just in Thai Son the other day for lunch and saw bahn mi on the menu- two versions (chicken or beef) with pictures on the side.&nbsp; Is the bahn mi mentioned here that&#039;s not on the menu something else?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to try it one day but want to make sure I&#039;m ordering the right thing.&nbsp; Thanks!

				I guess I forgot to report back on my banh mi experience at Thai Son.&nbsp; My wife and I ordered both types of sandwiches for take-out a while back.&nbsp; The pork or beef one was what I think of as a more typical banh mi sandwich, served cold, and the chicken one is served hot.&nbsp; Both were yummy, but not the very best I&#039;ve had.&nbsp; They needed some hot sauce or something to give them a little more kick.&nbsp; But they were still a rare treat and a welcome change from same-old-same-old sandwiches for lunch!<br /><br />I ordered from the counter, so I didn&#039;t see how they were represented in the menu.

				i can&#039;t wait to try the banh mi at thai son!<br /><br />because of the variations in banh mi<br />i find that the key to a really good banh mi are the ingredients.<br />the french baguette should be soft on the inside, slightly chewy crust.<br />the meats (whether chicken or pork) should be moist, not dry.<br />the pickled veggies should have both tanginess and sweetness.<br />there must be jalapeno slices (but be aware, they are very spicy) and of course<br />cilantro cilantro cilantro.<br />i really hope i love thai son&#039;s banh mi because i haven&#039;t found great banh mi in the city yet.<br /><br />on a different note, as a long time fan of nha trang in chinatown,<br />i was eager to compare the pho at thai son with the one at nha trang.<br />i found the pho at thai son to be aromatic and most delicious.<br />depending on each restaurant, i may or may not season the pho.<br />at thai son, i had the broth virgin, and loved it.<br />next up, the crispy squid.
