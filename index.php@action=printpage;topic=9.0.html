				I&#039;m looking forward to it - I check for progress every time I walk by. . . but unfortunately I&#039;m not seeing any!<br /><br />And perhaps this should be a different thread, but everyone always talks about how the rents on 37th Ave are prohibitively expensive.&nbsp; I still don&#039;t understand how all those 99 cent stores stay alive.&nbsp; Do they really sell that many items?&nbsp; How about that absolutely giant health and beauty items store on 37th between 83rd and 84th that always seems to be empty?&nbsp; I heard the rent is $17,000 a month.&nbsp; That&#039;s a lot of shampoo.<br /><br />So back to the point - why is it so hard to attract better businesses to the district when these other stores are managing to stay alive?&nbsp; At one point when people thought Starbucks was <strong>not</strong> coming, I heard this tossed around as a potential reason - that they demand lower rent spaces as they tend to be anchor stores for a neighborhood and rents on 37th Ave were too high.

				This was posted on the JH parents yahoo group page today.<br /><br />â€œYes it has been confirmed, STARBUCKS COFFEE Company will be opening<br />on 37 Ave! The neighborhood has been waiting for the arrival of its&#039;<br />first international retailer to 37th Avenue. We would like to welcome<br />Starbucks to our office building at 78-27 37th Avenue, The Queensboro<br />Building! All the rumors have come true according to our landlord News<br />Realty. They have confirmed that Starbucks has signed a lease in the<br />hood. I would like to thank all of the owners and staff at News Realty<br />for their continued efforts toward enriching our community. We are<br />proud to share an address with STARBUCKS COFFEE. See you here soon!â€<br /><br />So I hope Espresso 77 opens soon to get a nice head start.

				I am all for Starbucks coming to the nabe. I am not a coffee expert by any means and I tend to label my java in the following catergories: fresh, old, weak and strong. In my experience Starbucks typically delivers fresh and strong coffee, which is as good a rating I can give. In addition, Starbucks offers a good variety of tasty treats and seasonale beverages. <br />

				Yes, work is finally under way, thank heaven, and it is going to be a Starbucks.<br /><br />I moved here a number of years ago, and I&#039;ve been eagerly anticipating such a development, together with many longtime residents of my acquaintance. It&#039;s crucial that the commercial sector in this neighborhood be more balanced so that it serves the entire spectrum of people who live here. What we really need is a clean, attractive supermarket like Food Emporium. Starbucks is an extremely good first step, however. It&#039;s nice to finally have Fresh Direct service, but a physical, &quot;bricks-and-mortar&quot; presence of more attractive and upscale stores is crucial. <br />

				That&#039;s stunning; I certainly hope so. The Queensboro Corp. Building originally had similar windows with divided lights.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the best things about Starbucks is that its stores are not franchises, but are run directly by the company. Therefore, product standards are reliable, being consistently high throughout the chain. Best of all, because of its thorough market research, the company tends to serve as a &quot;green light&quot; for other desirable businesses, which are so desperately needed in a neighborhood dominated by shabby stores.

				I don&#039;t know if anyone confirmed the Starbucks location on this site...from what I have read, it&#039;s been a debate.<br /><br />So, in case you don&#039;t know, the Starbucks will be on 37th, between 77th and 78th, across from the Post Office and next to Novo.&nbsp; I was walking down 37th Ave, last night and peeked in the window of the empty storefront to look at the construction.&nbsp; On the floor, by the door was some heating and cooling apparatus hanging out of a box.&nbsp; On the box was a label addressed to STARBUCKS at that address.<br /><br />So there you have it!<br /><br />They stil have a lot to finish...but given the machine that Starbucks is, I predict they&#039;ll be open in time to serve some sort of Valentine&#039;s inspired &quot;beverage&quot;.

				Concern/joy about the arrival of Starbucks in Jackson Heights hits the Daily News...<br /><br />http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2008/01/15/2008-01-15_starbucks_perks_angst_excitement.html<br /><br />Starbucks perks angst, excitement<br /><br />BY BETWA SHARMA<br />SPECIAL TO NEWS<br /><br />Tuesday, January 15th 2008, 4:00 AM<br /><br />To the rich mix of ethnic businesses in Jackson Heights, a novel addition is coming: Starbucks.<br /><br />The pending arrival of the gourmet coffee chain has stirred up heated debates about what it means for the identity of the once-working-class community.<br /><br />Some are eagerly awaiting it, while others view it as a misfit in an area better known for its Little India and its vibrant Latino shops.<br /><br />The new Starbucks at 78-27 37th Ave. will be nestled among the independently owned stores.<br /><br />&quot;Some people are truly concerned about the mom-and-pop establishments and how they would be affected,&quot; said Marlene Flores, a real estate agent who lives and works in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Tania Mattos, who works in an art gallery and also lives in the neighborhood, said she loves the &quot;personal feel&quot; of smaller stores and sees the arrival of Starbucks as a sign of gentrification.<br /><br />But not everyone is against it.<br /><br />&quot;Starbucks represents a change in a neighborhood of mediocre mom-and-pop stores,&quot; said local resident Robair Russ.<br /><br />Donald Basse, who has lived in Jackson Heights for six years, believes Starbucks will add even more variety.<br /><br />&quot;We need to have more upscale businesses like Starbucks in Jackson Heights, so that all people who live here can have retail options,&quot; Basse said.<br /><br />The supporters will not have to wait long. Dan Lewis, a regional spokesman for the Seattle-based company, said the new store is scheduled to open in February. <br /><br /><em>(Follow the link for the complete article, including quotes from Espresso 77 and Lety&#039;s proprietors)</em>

				Wow, Starbucks in JH seems to be some type of historic event.&nbsp; Got a picture of the blueprints in the window of Starbucks when they started to work on it. I wonder if it will be worth something one day?&nbsp; :2funny:<br />Interesting discussion about gentrification.&nbsp;

				I read on chowhound that the opening date is Feb 22. I think the place looks gorgeous so far. Lots of comfy sofas, and floor lamps. Almost like a living room. Almost like they took their cue from Novo (but, with nicer and newer furniture). I guess they start posting that they&#039;re looking for help and get their staff together. It will be interesting to see the quality of the coffee. I&#039;ve seen mixed reviews about Starbucks coffee (which i happen to like). I think it varies from store to store.

				The STARBUCK&#039;S sign is up over the store today. <br /><br />Oddly enough, all the other stores in that building have had to remove their signs because they didn&#039;t comply with Landmark Policies. Flagship is fighting and has spent $$$$ so far in their lawsuit.<br /><br />This should be interesting to watch as Novo and Ingrid are in compliance.<br />

				Thanks for the link to curbed.&nbsp; The snarkiness/sarcasm in their piece is incredibly thick, though.&nbsp; It seems they love to hate Queens.<br /><br />&quot;My, that Jackson Heights sure is growing up! The Queens neighborhood nearly as popular as Tribeca has a brand new coffee shop, Racked reveals, and it&#039;s a cute little mom-and-pop operation called Starbucks. Writes Racked&#039;s tipster, &quot;Witness the brand new Starbucks on 37th Ave. and 79th Street in Jackson Heightsâ€”looks great and should be open this week. Starbucks is an amenity rarely seen or enjoyed throughout the 5 boroughs. And now we have one. And you don&#039;t.&quot; What&#039;s next, Jack Heights, one of those banks or frozen yogurt stores we&#039;ve been hearing about?&quot;<br />

				The following link will reveal the rules and guidelines for sign installation as they specifically pertain to the Jackson Heights Historic District.&nbsp; The information may be found under the heading of &quot;Storefronts in the Jackson Heights Historic District&quot;.&nbsp; Then look under &quot;Storefront Alterations&quot;, subsection &quot;(4) Signage&quot;.<br /><br />From skimming through the information at the LPC, it seems as if Starbucks may indeed be in violation.&nbsp; With respect to the storefront sign from the Eater website, it just may be that the LPC applies a different set a rules to differing neighborhoods.&nbsp; It can also just boil down to the questions of do two wrongs make a right?&nbsp; Do two negatives always equal a positive, or does that only apply in Algebra?&nbsp; Blah, blah, blah.... ;) <br /><br />http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/pubs/rules.pdf<br /><br />If you click on &quot;Appendix A&quot; from the Table of Contents, you will see a useful diagram of a storefront defining the terminology as used within the guidelines.

				From the DoB&#039;s Building Information Systems website, Starbucks did not apply for a signage permit, and they also self-certified the project (meaning the DoB did not review their plans, but it is subject to an audit at a later date, at which time they may be forced to make changes that do not comply to code).<br /><br />They did receive LPC approval on 11/14/07. The approval indicates that the &quot;FLAGSHIP&quot; awning was never issued a permit and has been in violation since 2001. It also indicates if the owner does not fix this violation, they may be required to appear in court and pay a fine from the Environmental Control Board.<br /><br />The LPC Approval also indicates that the plans that were approved for Starbucks did not address any current or future signage. I tried to attach the LPC Approval to this; hopefully it works. I did not see a separate signage permit application, but it may be in process and just not in the system yet.

				I didn&#039;t go to the opening with the free beverage, however, went this am on my way to work. It was around 7:30 so not so crowded. They were quite nice. I was waiting for my coffee, and the barista who took my order thought someone else took it, and realized I was waiting for awhile. Due to this they gave me a larger beverage at a lesser cost due to the wait---great service? I also had the apple donut---yum, yum. Really impressed. I agree it&#039;s one of the nicer ones.

				This article in today&#039;s NY Times today about plans to close a Newark, NJ Starbuck&#039;s is pretty interesting.&nbsp; Funny how some were/are opposed to the one in JH, yet in Newark, they&#039;re actually campaigning to keep theirs!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/nyregion/23starbucks.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=newark%20starbuck&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin<br /><br />Don&#039;t know a good thing until it&#039;s gone I suppose......<br /><br />Some interesting comments:<br /><br />â€œItâ€™s the only nice place on this street,â€ said Jorge Espana, a 70-year old retiree who comes to Starbucks twice a week from the other side of town. He pointed down Broad Street, a busy shopping thoroughfare dominated by nail salons and fast-food restaurants. On Monday afternoon, the Starbucks was packed with customers. Mr. Espana sat near a window. <br /><br />Starbucks â€œis important for me,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s important for a lot of people.â€<br /><br />His fellow patrons reflected a slice of Newark, the locals and commuters who work in the cityâ€™s slowly recovering downtown, where there are few places, apart from the Starbucks, to sit and have coffee.<br />.<br />.<br />One regular, Nijim Muddaththir, runs a food cart a few blocks away. â€œAll the guys from the mosque come here,â€ Mr. Muddaththir said. â€œItâ€™s our meeting place.â€ <br /><br />Robert Brozon had just missed his friends, a regular gathering of social workers. <br /><br />â€œI was shocked that with the revitalization, with the face-lift here, they would remove the Starbucks,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m confused about what message theyâ€™re trying to send.â€

				If the JH Starbucks rent is $17k, I estimate they would need to sell 13,000 of their $4 cups of specialty drinks each month in order to stay in business. That&#039;s 433 cups each day. Is that even possible?

				I&#039;m assuming that in order to pay for their rent and other expenses (supplies, salaries, insurance, etc) they need to make three times what the rent is in order to stay in business. It&#039;s just a guess based on what I know of running other types of (non-retail) businesses.<br /><br />I&#039;m using $4 as the &quot;average&quot; (again a guess) cost of espresso drinks and food. It might actually be more than that, which would mean they&#039;d need to sell more than 433 items per day. The coffee beans would help definitely since they are more than $10/bag I believe.<br />

				I noticed that Starbucks has launched a new breakfast menu intended to be healthier than the traditional offering of breakfast pastries.&nbsp; Among the new items is the &quot;Perfect Oatmeal&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;The website&#039;s description of the oatmeal is as follows:<br /><br />&quot;<strong>Perfect Oatmeal</strong> 100% whole-grain goodness finished with your choice of dried fruit, nut medley or brown sugar.&quot;<br /><br />Has anyone tried the oatmeal yet?&nbsp; With the fall season upon us, this seems like a nice option to have when I&#039;m in the mood for oatmeal and want to head outdoors for a quick breakfast.<br /><br />Also new to the menu are the Fruit Stella, Chewy Fruit &amp; Nut Bar, Multigrain Roll, Apple Bran Muffin and Power Protein Plate.&nbsp; Other than the muffin, none of these items really excite me that much.<br /><br />New breakfast menu at Starbucks (http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_freshfood.asp)

				The story about Starbucks wasting water was written without the person doing his or her homework.&nbsp; Starbucks and every coffee shop has to pay for water.&nbsp; So why do you think they are using water?&nbsp; It is because they are required to by health departments around the world.&nbsp; The water is used to clean the utensils between every drink.&nbsp; Running water is used in high volume ice cream shops as well.&nbsp; If you ever worked in a restaurant or food service, you would not complain about the water used.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s kind of an interesting legal question, because the advertisement just said &quot;Tell us you voted,&quot; which doesn&#039;t require proof of voting- and it does also imply that you can hit up several starbucks.

				I saw this advertised awhile ago. I would be willing to try something like this to bring to work- We don&#039;t have a coffee maker there, nor a kitchen type facility that would work to keep the coffee maker clean. When we did have a coffee maker, it was just gross. However, we do have a fridge where I could stash some milk (assuming that I&#039;d remember to ditch it at the end of the week) and it&#039;s a lot cheaper than getting some drip coffee on my way to work, which is my current habit. <br /><br />I guess the three pack would be like a sample pack? It would suck to pay $10 for 12 cups and not like it- they&#039;ll probably sell a lot more initially by selling a 3 pack for $3.

				Hey, I just noticed that Shelby2 never answered my question above, but we&#039;ll let that slide for now. &nbsp;Here&#039;s more interesting stuff. &nbsp;;)<br /><br />The Brooklyn Heights Blog reports that their local Starbucks has added what&#039;s being called a &quot;Slapuccino&quot; to their beverage menu. &nbsp;Apparently, an angry customer slapped a waiting dad on the head because said dad&#039;s baby wouldn&#039;t stop fidgeting. &nbsp;<br /><br />Dad Slapped at Starbucks: Brooklyn Heights Justice or Just Plain Crazy? (http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/15047)<br /><br />This is crazy and so wrong. &nbsp; ::) &nbsp;If this story is true, I would imagine that the slapper must have been teetering on the edge to do what he did.
