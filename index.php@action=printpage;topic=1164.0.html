				Has anyone been? To my shame I&#039;ve only discovered it yesterday, even though the manager said it&#039;s been around for 6 years. The outside didn&#039;t look like much, but it&#039;s nice inside, and there were a whole bunch of families enjoying lunch when I popped in. My previous Indian-Chinese mainstay was Chilli Chicken but this looks like it has a bigger menu and better decor.

				I used to go there all the time when I lived nearby.&nbsp; It was my first introduction to Indian Chinese food, and when I took some of my Indian friends there, they were delighted by it.&nbsp; Now Indian Chinese seems to be a bit easier to find.&nbsp; My wife and I used to love the place, especially since the friendly wait staff would practically babysit for us while we enjoyed our meal.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been back in a while, but last time I was there, the food was a bit too salty for my tastes.&nbsp; But I&#039;d definitely go back.

				I LOVE THIS PLACE. Talk of the Town Indian Style Chinese is the father of Indian Style Chinese. Unlike other restaurants their executive chef is from Bombay and knows what Indian style Chinese is. First they have excellent service, great ambiance and they also deliver. But the best part is that on weekdays they have a 50% lunch off which is a killer bargain. Anyway people hope u guys go and enjoy it!!!!!

				I&#039;ve only been here once, a couple of summers ago.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t look like much from outside, but once you go inside, the atmosphere is very nice.&nbsp; I must have gone at an odd time, because I recall being the only person in the place.&nbsp; I got some kind of vegetable curry entree and it was delicious.&nbsp; Service was excellent as well.&nbsp; Definitely check it out, and tell the rest of us about your experience!

				Can anyone touch upon how Indian Chinese is different from Chinese?&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen this Talk of the Town place and am interested in trying it out, but I&#039;d like to have a sense of what I&#039;d be getting myself into.&nbsp; Any particular dish you recommend?

				I just placed Talk of the Town on my must go to restaurants.&nbsp; This is the first time I&#039;ve heard about this restaurant.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been going to an Indian Chinese Nanking at 72-23 37th Avenue for lunch.&nbsp; I really like this place with a special lunch price and you have 40 choices.&nbsp; I especially like Chilli Shrimp, Chilli Chicken, Basil Chicken.&nbsp; Lots of vegetarian choices. It comes with soup and jasmine rice.&nbsp; I recommend the hot &amp; sour soup without the chicken. The Mughlai menu has no soup but you have either naan or roti and can have either basmati rice or pulao.&nbsp; Very nice atmosphere and service.&nbsp; Friendly staff.&nbsp; Served Monday to Friday from 11:30 to 3:30.&nbsp; They have buffet on the weekends.&nbsp;

				Can&#039;t wait to try Talk of the Town.&nbsp; <br /><br />I recently went to Nanking and was very impressed as well.&nbsp; Loved the chicken lollipops. Also great that they deliver!<br />Thought it was much better than Indian Chinese I had in Manhattan&#039;s Curry Hill and the big one i think called Tangra Masala in Sunnyside.

				I went last night with my friend and was very impressed with the food and service.&nbsp; We got a very flavorful appetizer, it was thai with paneer and vegetables.. can&#039;t remember the name, but it was #8 on the vegetarian appetizers list.&nbsp; My main entree, veg. chilli (on vegetarian entrees list) was very good.&nbsp; My friend found the one &quot;common&quot; dish on the menu--chicken lo mein, and she liked it.&nbsp; Dessert was complimentary--some sort of rice pudding that I believe had rice noodles in it instead of rice?&nbsp; It was good as well.&nbsp; We sat there for 4 hours talking, and never felt bothered or rushed out.&nbsp; Besides continually filling our water glasses, and asking how the food was, we were left alone until we decided to leave.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely be going back.
