				Title: <strong>New Coned scam - phone and text</strong><br />

				I got a call from a 718 number. Sometimes I pick those up even if I don&#039;t know who is calling, because some of the businesses I deal with are located in 718 (like my pharmacy). The woman said she was calling from Coned and asked to speak with the person responsible for paying the bill. I told her if she&#039;s calling from Coned then she should know who is responsible. She then said my name. I asked &quot;You are actually calling from Coned?&quot; and she replied &quot;Of course.&quot; (which made me more suspicious).<br /><br />I told her that I was too busy to talk but she can put something in the mail to me and then I hung up. A few minutes later I got a text filled with typos that tells me I need to call a 1-800 number or my electricity will be cut off at noon tomorrow.<br /><br />Anyway, just wanted you to warn your elderly friends and neighbors (and anyone else you think might fall into a scam trap) that this is the new thing.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/TCydK86.jpg)

				From Con Edison&#039;s website:<br /><br />&quot;Scammers looking to rip off Con Edison customers have begun asking them to make payments by Cash App and Zelle.<br /><br />Con Edison does not support these platforms for payment. Any customer who gets a request to pay a Con Edison bill by Cash App or Zelle should beware that the person making the request is a scammer who will steal the money.<br /><br />The company is marking the Federal Trade Commission’s National Consumer Protection Week by again warning customers that they should be aware of scammers. Con Edison is a member of Utilities United Against Scams, a group of companies that seeks to educate customers about signs that someone is trying to steal from them.<br /><br />Con Edison gets complaints every day from customers saying they received suspicious phone calls from people claiming to be from the company and demanding money.<br /><br />These callers often say the customer owes money and service will be turned off unless the customer immediately buys a pre-paid card and provides the scammer with the number. Once the customer puts money on the card and provides the scammer with the card number, the scammer steals the money.<br /><br />These callers sometimes point the customer to a store that sells pre-paid cards. The scammers target residential and business customers in all parts of Con Edison’s New York City and Westchester County service area. Spanish-speaking customers often receive calls from scammers who are fluent in Spanish.<br /><br />Con Edison does not accept payment by pre-paid debit cards, MoneyGram or similar transfers. The company does not call customers and demand immediate payment. Further, Con Edison has stopped turning off service for non-payment during the health emergency.<br /><br />Never arrange payment or divulge account or personal information, including debit or credit card information, over the phone unless you are certain you are speaking to Con Edison. If you are unsure call 1-800-75-CONED to check.<br /><br />Scam callers can even make a Con Edison phone number show up on the customer’s caller ID.<br /><br />Sometimes impostors go to a customer’s home or business and try to get money by saying the customer is delinquent on Con Edison bills and threatening a service turnoff.<br /><br />If someone comes to your home or business claiming to be from Con Edison, ask for identification. If you are still unsure, call 1-800-75-CONED.<br /><br /><strong>Customers should also be aware of these scammer tactics:</strong><br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>A scammer may call a business or residential customer and say a computer glitch prevented the customer’s payments from being recorded. These scammers then urge the customer to buy a pre-paid card.<br />Someone calls and says the customer owes Con Edison a deposit for a smart meter. The caller tells the customer to make an immediate payment by Bitcoin. This scam usually targets businesses.<br />Con Edison does not require deposits for smart meters or accept payment by Bitcoin.<br />Some impostors who knock on a residential customer’s door try to talk their way inside to steal or even commit an assault.</li><li></li></ul>
