			Hello JH neighbors. <br /><br />I would like to hear from people that have been done or are going through renovations recently. Did you feel the materials were more expensive? Fewer choices and longer times to arrive? <br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />D

			I did a recent renovation. I don&#039;t have a previous renovation to be compared against so I don&#039;t know it&#039;s more expensive or not.<br /><br />However, I want to point out that the determining factor of the renovation cost is the labor (especially in a coop), some increase in the material cost doesn&#039;t matter much.<br /><br />

			Thanks for the answer! Could you tell me a bit more about the labor (especially in a coop) being the more expensive part? Pardon my ignorance, but what would be the difference between the coop and condo here?

			Not sure what you are talking about when you say it&#039;s more expensive in a coop. Huh? Why? There is labor and there are materials--same thing whether in a coop, condo, or house. Of course, more credentials and licenses might be required in a coop or condo vs <br />a private house, where nobody is overseeing what you do. And yes, materials are scarcer and more costly now than before the pandemic. There are more shortages and delays now. In a coop or condo, you might have to go through approvals, you might have to hire an architect--that would add expense, but we&#039;ve had two coops where we&#039;ve done renovations and we never had to hire an architect. Overall, yes, we&#039;ve been told that materials now cost more and there are shortages.
