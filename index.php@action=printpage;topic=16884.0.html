				File this in the &quot;strange crimes&quot; category!<br /><br />(http://i.imgur.com/NzuJmZ8.jpg?1)<br /><br />It does also say he&#039;s wanted in a series of break-ins. It&#039;s just strange that the one they put on the flyer is about the cases of water.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good reminder to follow the rule not to leave ANYTHING visible in your car!

				I live on this block.&nbsp; I never keep anything of value in my car anyway, but I absolutely agree.&nbsp; Nothing visible - ever.&nbsp; If anything is visible, I put it in the glove or the trunk.&nbsp; Why make yourself a target.

				Maybe it&#039;s the bag, but also the closed leg walk, looks kinda like a woman to me.

				Fortunately, the guy was caught. Turns out he had broken as many as 25 car windows to steal whatever he could.<br /><br />NYPD credits neighborhood coordination officers for cracking Queens car burglary spree (http://abc7ny.com/nypd-credits-new-program-for-cracking-car-burglary-spree/2341814/)

				When I lived in DC, someone broke the window of my car and stole a giant 5-pound hershey bar that I won in a raffle. I didn&#039;t even want the stupid thing - I think Hershey&#039;s chocolate is barely edible. I was going to give it away and left it on the car seat for about an hour when I ran an errand. I guess someone really had the munchies.
