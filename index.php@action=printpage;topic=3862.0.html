				Title: <strong>grocery workers</strong><br />

				Thanks for the thread about the tipping protocol for building supers and others. That&#039;s what I love about this online community, which mimics something organic and old-time. You could live here for a hundred years and still not know anyone. Online here, more questions are raised and answered than I&#039;d ever have time to think of myself, so thanks for that. That tipping thread is only an example.&nbsp; So, thanks for all that...<br /><br />Now, what I&#039;m curious about are the grocery workers, especially at Trade Fair.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the situation is? Is it just that the management there allows them to ask for tips (I don&#039;t see this at the Met, for example) and before I make any assumptions I&#039;m seeking some information/assistance in seeking information about what the deal is.&nbsp; <br /><br />I still have a recurring dream about working for 3.25 an hour as a grocery store bagger when I was in high school (and until I was 18 when as a cashier I could make more than the 3.75 an hour ceiling for baggers). My students are shocked to hear how much I made from age 15-18 (1983-85). Once I turned 18 about three years later, I was promoted to cashier (and immediately quit, since freedom to wander off, collect carts, do carry-outs, etc., was a perk work preserving when compared to the responsibilities of being a cashier). My students are shocked but the truth is that 3.50 or so per hour back then was more in real dollars than 7 and change is now. For example, fuel was under a dollar a gallon, for just one misleading indicator.<br /><br />Back to the Trade Fair workers.&nbsp; I read somewhere about a suit filed on behalf of workers at a Brooklyn grocery store for some situation where they were not being properly compensated -- Does anyone know what I&#039;m talking about?&nbsp; I don&#039;t assume that this is the case here, but that&#039;s why I&#039;d like to know what others here know about this...&nbsp; <br /><br />Generally, it&#039;s my policy to tip well and tip often, especially pizza workers, baristas, and others whose incomes need community supplement since I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s difficult as a small business owner to pay what is proper and fair--I&#039;m not apologizing for them but rather for the market-based system, which I loathe. <br /><br />Any thoughts?&nbsp; I know what the Living Wage is, so once I get some proper information I may come back around with something about that... But first, as Tony T says, &quot;just the facts.&quot; Well, if you have some facts, please share...<br /><br />

				The problem with tip jars--and tipping in general--is that it unburdens business owners from having to pay a decent wage to their employees. There is a certain sentiment which runs through this forum (as it does in many neighborhoods) which seems to think that buying local is necessarily more ethical than buying from larger, faceless businesses. Well, exploitation is exploitation, and mom-and-pop shops are often the worst offenders. What we as neighbors should be doing is supporting any effort by employees to unionize. Generous tips alone won&#039;t help provide a family with a steady income.

				So, Jadasie, can you answer my question? I&#039;m happy to help the baggers unionize, but I still need to know whether they&#039;re getting paid at all. To follow-up on your generalization about posters here, the problem with ideology-driven arguments is that they often overlook the discussion at-hand in order to make a point.

				CupcakeTownie,<br /><br />Since this is a forum and not a Q &amp; A, and since the topic at hand was about workers getting paid fairly, I thought the so-called ideology of union-organizing was appropriate to bring to the mix. You did ask, after all, for our thoughts (but then you asked for &quot;just the facts,&quot; so admittedly I was confused).<br /><br />But to address your question: No, I don&#039;t know if baggers are getting paid. You may wish to do some investigative research, maybe ask a bagger or two, or three or four. Maybe give them your number so they don&#039;t have to talk to you while on the job. If you&#039;re serious about this, get in touch with Make the Road By Walking. Their website is: http://www.maketheroad.org/ (http://www.maketheroad.org/)

				Two or three years ago I had a student who was a bagger at Associated in Astoria. He was paid only in tips. I don&#039;t know if the situation is different now, but that store has undergone major revamping in that time.

				Here&#039;s more on the topic of low-wage earners and lack of fair pay.&nbsp; The Elmhurst C-Town supermarket is mentioned once again with an example of its alleged unfair wage practices:<br />&nbsp;<br />Most Low-Wage Workers Are Cheated of Pay, Report Finds (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/patrick-mcgeehan-wage-post/)<br /><strong><br />New York Times, City Room blog:<br /></strong><br /><em><strong>&quot;One of them, Guadalupe Medina de Morales, a 66-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic who worked at the store until 2005, said her only pay in eight years of bagging and delivering groceries full-time for C-Town had been tips from the customers, which amounted to about $125 a week.<br /><br />â€œNunca, nunca,â€ Ms. Medina de Morales said â€” â€œneverâ€ in Spanish â€” to describe how she was paid by the storeâ€™s managers, who still had her fill out W-2 tax forms like any other employee.<br /><br />Even though the store paid her no hourly or weekly wage, it dared to extract about $17 a week from her tips to cover its withholding and unemployment insurance taxes, according to state officials.&quot;</strong></em>

				So what is the recommendation in terms of customers tipping the baggers?&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems to me that if we don&#039;t, we are taking advantage of people who don&#039;t make any money if we don&#039;t tip them.&nbsp; On the other hand, if we do tip, we are in some way being enablers, by making the system work for the bad guys (the store owners who break the law and don&#039;t pay their employees minimum wage).

				Here&#039;s an update on the story involving some local supermarkets accused of unfair labor/wage practices.&nbsp; According to the article, the markets have agreed to pay affected employees wages and overtime pay due them.&nbsp; &nbsp;And while on this topic, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve noticed less baggers at some of the local supermarkets.&nbsp; Hmm...<br /><br />From <strong>YourNabe.com:</strong><br /><br />Queens supermarkets owe workers back pay: Labor Dept.
