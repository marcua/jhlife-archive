					Hi all, <br />Is anyone interested in community solar in Queens? I am in touch with a company starting up in NYC, they&#039;ve done community solar for renters in Mt. Vernon and are starting projects in Brooklyn and Queens. <br />Community solar is a way for people who live in apartments to &quot;lease&quot; solar panels on other roofs, and buy clean power through solar. It is transferred through your utility bill, you still get a ConEd bill. It is prices the same as you currently pay or cheaper. <br />If you are interested please let me know! I am trying to arrange an in-person evening meeting with this company&#039;s rep, in JH, to answer questions. It is a new business model for electricity and a way to buy clean power if you don&#039;t own your own roof (and thus cannot put solar panels on it) Ideally this meeting would take place before Thanksgiving.<br />This is the company: <a href="https://www.thepowermarket.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.thepowermarket.com/</a><br />Thanks! <br />Melanie <br />

					That&#039;s the fear - what if someone comes by before person who found the spot on the app arrives. Then what? But we don&#039;t know till we try it, a good app will make the person coming to get the spot arrive on time or forfeit the spot.&nbsp; For my part, if I post that a spot is available, I would find it hard to wait for someone to arrive if they are late. Or if I forget to post it before I leave (which the app allows, you can say such and such a spot will be open at 2 pm). I&#039;m more likely to remember to do it when I&#039;m leaving. Maybe that&#039;s just reality. So it could be a place where people post available spots, and if you get there in time you get it. <br /><br />The controversy was in Boston and I think also SF, and yes, people were selling public, free spots. Like, $5 for a Monday cleaning spot at 34th and 75th. Kind of illegal to sell free parking. This is just sharing not selling. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=15109.msg72528#msg72528">Quote from: Jeffsayyes on July 25, 2016, 04:00:56 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Seems a bit too cliquish.

					I would also love an app that could fix people&#039;s inconsiderate parking! All they have to do is pull closer to the next car. Until someone figures out how to do THAT, I&#039;m willing to try another solution. <br /><br />I wish NYC would paint the curb by hydrants, other cities do this and it works.

					It is a huge ticket - maybe $130 in Queens but I got a ticket in Manhattan in a similar sweep 2 years ago, where literally every cyclist I know got a red light ticket. It was $190 and I went to court hoping to get that enormous fine reduced. The judge told me he hated cyclists and ignored everything I said but at least lowered the fine - to $150. Triple the fine for a car running a red light!!&nbsp; (Because bikes kill triple the amount of people as cars?)&nbsp; And -- if a cyclist gets a 2nd red light ticket it is like $350. !!! This doesn&#039;t even apply for cars. <br /><br />If cops want to ticket cyclists they need to start with the ones that really break laws and are reckless. Like riding electric bikes on sidewalks, going the wrong way down a one way, and talking on the phone or texting while cycling. These red light tickets for people being safe are cash grabs for cops who need to make quotas. <br />

					There is a new app -- Parkarr -- to help people find parking spots. It is crowd-sourced and very new, so I can&#039;t say it actually works because because as far as I know I am only person in JH using it! Am sharing it here, as I know I&#039;m not the only person who drives around endlessly looking for a spot and wishing for a way to make it easier. <br /><br />Basically you &quot;host&quot; as spot when you are leaving, so that someone else using the app can look for it. And when you need a spot you look for it. <br /><br />It is really brand new, less than a year old, I think there are more people using it in Manhattan. I found it because they were marketing in LIC/Astoria. Would love to see enough people in JH use it to see if it makes our parking easier! (And hopefully not making it worse as they speculate in the CBS video).<br /><br />You can find it in Apple app store. Or here: <a href="http://www.parkarr.com/#intro" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.parkarr.com/#intro</a><br /><br />They got a little press: <br /><a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/19/parkarr-parking-app/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/02/19/parkarr-parking-app/</a><br />

					Thanks everyone for your help and input. I will look into Assemblyman Moya&#039;s plans, and Birchwood House,&nbsp; would love to talk to someone on Birchwood board. Sometimes there is more involved in getting the job done than meets the eye, although it is getting to be easier and easier to connect to the grid and manage the paperwork.<br /><br />For reference, since I am making a film, my plan is to share all the information I obtain, as long as I am not told it is private. Some places might have proprietary financial information for example, so as typical in a documentary all of that is negotiated and agreed upon. But the goal is to demystify and share info. <br /><br />If anyone else has any references please do keep them coming. All types of stories and experiences welcome. I have several people on camera sharing how they installed solar, it either paid itself off in a short amount of time (like 5 years) or will based on their initial results. For one person the bill went to $18 a month from an average of $120. A business also said the same thing - their bill went to basically zero. I have yet to find someone who has told me it did not pay off. Wonder if that&#039;s just who I&#039;m talking to or if solar really is that good! <br /><br /><a href="http://www.PowerCityFilm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.PowerCityFilm.com</a><br /><br />Thanks! <br />Melanie <br /><br />

					Hello all, <br /><br />If anyone is trying to install solar panels on their co-op or private home and would like to share their experiences I would love to speak to you. I am a filmmaker, professor, and new JH resident, and making a documentary about solar and wind power integrating into NYC, NJ, and other places. <br /><br />The film is looking at all types of experiences - positive success stories, and also challenging stories like issues with a co-op board not agreeing about solar or wind turbines (there are some co-op buildings in NYC with their own wind turbines on the roofs), and issues with hooking into the grid or getting permits. The documentary is in its early stages and your story could help provide insight to many people. <br /><br />If you are interested or know someone who it please contact me if you are interested at <a href="mailto:MLR@powercityfilm.com" class="bbc_email">MLR@powercityfilm.com</a>. <br />Thank you, <br />Melanie<br /><br />More: <a href="http://www.powercityfilm.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.powercityfilm.com</a> <br />About me: <a href="http://www.melanielarosa.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.melanielarosa.com</a> <br /><br />&nbsp;
