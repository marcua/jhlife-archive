				Agree with this is not a good time. My mother-in-law, age 92, filed an application for an assisted living place just before the pandemic hit, and we are very grateful she is not there now. It&#039;s a more dangerous environment vis-a-vis the virus, the residents are confined to their rooms now, with meals dropped off at their door, no social life at all, and they cannot receive visitors. Like being in jail! Much better to find someone to come in and help, daily if necessary. Which is still happening even now--I know a few people who have elderly parents who have aides that come in to assist every day.
