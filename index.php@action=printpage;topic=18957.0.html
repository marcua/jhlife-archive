				Di11372:&nbsp; Just recently two identical one bedroom apartments sold at the Berkeley for $538,500.&nbsp; Both apartments faced the street and were in good condition.&nbsp; This one bedroom apartment featured in Curbed NY is on the top floor facing the Garden and is in exceptional condition.&nbsp; Although the price appears extremely high, its fairly priced based on current market prices for cooperatives in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I&#039;m 100% convinced that this apartment will sell quickly for full price.&nbsp;

				JH3525:Hello. It is still pretty rare to see a 1 bdrm on the market in JH for over 400k, anyone can do a search on zillow to see that.

				You are absolutely correct JH3525! Pricing of this listing did come at the heels of our last sale in the building of unit A36 ( same layout) on 3rd floor of 35-25 77th St Berkeley. We sold and closed at the exact asking price of $538,500 one month ago on March 26, 2019. The bathroom was original and kitchen was last updated over 10 years ago. Buyers plan to update both. Link to A36 : http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-25-77th-street-a36/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-25-77th-street-a36/)<br /><br />This new one requires no updates, is 3 floors higher and to be accurate also faces the street and looks over neighboring walk up Hampton Court and Greystones beyond it, hence the open view. No argument that it is one of the highest priced one bedrooms, as was our last sale at The Berkeley before it. <br />Link to B65 :<br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-24-78th-street-b65/<br />&nbsp;(http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-24-78th-street-b65/)<br />

				Armen, in addition to selling A36 at the Berkeley recently for $538,500, you also sold a similar one bedroom at the Monroe (3521 79 St) for $538,500.&nbsp; When you sell your current listing at the Berkeley for $578,500 it will be your third one bedroom that you have sold in Jackson Heights for over $500,000 which has never been done before.&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp;

				Much appreciated JH3525!<br /><br />To be more accurate, we sold several other 1 beds over 500k even earlier. Some converted to 2ned/jr4 some not. Here are few other examples to ones you mentioned:<br /><br />Not converted: <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/77-11-35th-avenue-3p/<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-36-79th-street-3/<br /><br />Converted :<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/77-11-35th-avenue-6n/<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/37-31-73rd-street-7f/<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is a beautiful apartment and based on other sales it should sell rather quickly.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed about&nbsp; these listings is they all have nice hardwood floors.&nbsp; I have lived in a few coops in the neighborhood and they all enforced the rule that aside from the kitchen and bathroom 80% of the floors must be covered by carpet.&nbsp; Have these rules been relaxed or do most&nbsp; people just no longer abide by them?

				Hi JHALUM<br /><br />Good observation, there are few different answers. First floor units don’t really need to worry about sound transfer, two of them have soundproof sub flooring , couple had area rugs which we rolled up for shoot , but in general I find carpeting rule gets activated in the event of noise complaints. Buildings where sound insulation between floors is weak, tend to enforce it more vigorously. In most cases area rugs are sufficient. Vacant units usually have carpets removed as well. <br /><br />Important to understand, that buyers still want to know the condition of floors below carpets, regardless if they want to carpet them wall to wall or use area rugs or other alternative materials. If possible to display floor for sale, it is good practice to do so.<br /><br />

				I have no idea if the price is high or not but the condition is mint and the apartment has something many in JH don&#039;t have: a new kitchen and new bath. In the best case scenario the cost to add those to an unrenovated apartment would be $40K. And that&#039;s low ball.<br /><br />In my experience there are tons of unrenovated apartments in JH. Many need <em>complete </em>renovation. This one needs zero. So let&#039;s consider what the price would be without reno: $499K.<br /><br />

				Beautiful!&nbsp; And the price seems about right for a large, renovated 1br in the historic district. <br /><br />JHALUM, Regarding the 80% rug rule, I think that&#039;s one of those clauses that is there in case someone has an issue with their upstairs neighbor&#039;s noise but isn&#039;t otherwise enforced. I don&#039;t think the guy above me has any rugs (maybe one), but he&#039;s pretty quiet and it doesn&#039;t bother me. It can be annoying when he vacuums (and he&#039;s an obsessive vacuumer!) but that&#039;s something I can tolerate easily. I&#039;m sure if I complained he&#039;d have to comply with the 80% rule, but I&#039;m not going to say anything since I&#039;m fine with it. The crystals in my ceiling light make a slight jangling sound when he walks across his dining area and I actually kind of like it - it&#039;s like having a gentle wind chime in my apartment!&nbsp;

				Hello everyone,<br /><br />Thought I&#039;d post a quick update on this. After a couple of weeks on the market we were able to identify buyers for this apartment and the property is presently under contract. Ironically, not expecting to outperform our own expectations, we had scheduled a video shoot for this property, and so we went through with the shoot anyway for posterity :) Hope to share it with you soon. <br /><br />Listing link: http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-24-78th-street-b65/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-24-78th-street-b65/)<br />

Value is scrutinized by lending banks, anyone looking at recently sold comps etc...&nbsp; Yet ultimately we were able to pull this deal off in record time and closed at 560k early August. <br /><br />This is a good example of what marketable renovation, supportive seller and compatible/capable agency combination can accomplish. <br /><br />Happy Halloween everyone :) !
