				Many of you probably know the movie The Wrong Man, by Alfred Hitchcock took place and was filmed in Jackson Heights. In my first month here, I rented the movie and loved that it was taking place right underneath me. <br /><br />Here is a great site with photos then and now of the locations in the movie.<br />http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Location_trip_to_New_York,_September-October_2003_-_part_2<br /><br />

				Giving away my age, I had the plesaure of watching the filming and meeting Jimmy Stewart and Hitchcock. I even had Hitchcock signature (his profile) :D but can&#039;t find it now.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />The filming was along 74th street and 37th avenue. They used a small german deli near me (between 84th and 85th street) for some settings.<br /><br />It was a lot of fun. <br /><br />p.s. I love the movie.

				JP, you&#039;re better than those square cubes that have a &quot;word a day&quot; to learn.&nbsp; &nbsp;First I had to look up Sisyphean and now Mingus.&nbsp; LOVE THAT!<br /><br />But what does being a bassist have to do with THE WRONG MAN?&nbsp; Is the script about a musician?&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember this Hitchcock flick.

				Here&#039;s a brief excerpt of Wikipedia entry on The Wrong Man:<br /><br />The film examines the life of Manny Balestrero (Henry Fonda), who works as a musician in the Stork Club in New York. He and his wife have very little money.&nbsp; Thus, when his wife needs some dental work, Manny attempts to borrow on her policy at the insurance office.&nbsp; Unfortunately for him, he closely physically resembles an armed robber who held up the office twice before, so the police are called. Manny is arrested and charged with the crime.&nbsp; Manny is identified by several witnesses, and he nervously misspells a word in the same way as the word appeared on the robbery note.&nbsp; We see his travels through the criminal justice system through fingerprinting, line-up, arraignment and so forth.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t seen this one yet myself, it&#039;s on my Netflix list.&nbsp; Henry Fonda was excellent in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;.&nbsp; I would never imagine a movie that spends almost the entire movie focused on a single room as something interesting, but that film contains some outstanding acting that today&#039;s &quot;Hollywood stars&quot; could learn a lot from.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				Sorry for my error earlier. I said I met Jimmy Stewart when it was Henry Fonda. <br />Listen, I was just a little kid at the time.&nbsp; :-\<br />My memory was in error. But I did meet Hitchcock - that&#039;s for sure!&nbsp; ;D

				Not just a musician, a bassist! There&#039;s a great sequence of Fonda playing, then putting the bass in the bag at the club before he leaves to get on the train. I know, but it&#039;s stuff I notice...<br /><br />PresterJohn - more Paul chambers than Mingus&nbsp; :)

				There&#039;s also a scene where Fonda walks down 82 st towards Roosevelt.<br /><br />In the trailer for the film is a scene that was cut from the film where you can see the house I grew up in on 74th off Broadway. It was my grandparents house at the time. I never knew that scene existed until I rented it recently.<br /><br />The film Queen of the Stardust Ballroom has many of the same locales.

				(https://the.hitchcock.zone/gallery/260/177.jpg)<br /><br />From Councilmember Danny Dromm&#039;s newsletter:<br /><br /><strong>Manny &quot;the Wrong Man&quot; Balestrero Way</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Saturday, September 27th<br />Noon - 2PM<br />73rd Street &amp; 41st Avenue, Woodside<br />&nbsp;<br />Christopher Emmanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Balestrero shot to unsought fame after his arrest on January 14, 1953 outside his home in Elmhurst, Queens. After three witnesses identified Manny as the person who robbed a Prudential Insurance Company office, he was charged with two armed robberies and, despite his innocence, brought to trial. He was later exonerated after another man confessed to the crimes that Manny was wrongfully accused of committing. His story, which highlights how the criminal justice system can fail law-abiding New Yorkers, captured the imagination of renowned artists such as Alfred Hitchcock, who captured Manny&#039;s story by shooting &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; on the streets of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Woodside, where the actual events occurred.<br />&nbsp;<br />In honor of his life and the impact his experience had on the community, I am having the city name the southwest corner of 73rd Street and 41st Avenue &quot;Manny &#039;The Wrong Man&#039; Balestrero Way&quot;.<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information &amp; to RSVP, please contact Yessika Giraldo at ygiraldo@council.nyc.gov or 718-803-6373 Ext. 205<br />&nbsp;<br />Special Thanks to: CB4Q District Manager Christian Cassagnol and Community Board 4 Queens.
