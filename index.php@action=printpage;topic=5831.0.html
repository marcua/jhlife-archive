				bella,<br /><br />Watch out for the desperate hairstylists - they&#039;re like hawks when you walk in the door.&nbsp; Between that and the fact that they talk about their customers in front of them (in another language of course) I won&#039;t be back.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame cuz they had potential.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not surprised they&#039;ve resorted to posting discounts on the message board. :)

				i went in for a mani-pedi in the fall, and the technician did an absolutely wonderful job. she worked more carefully and offered more little tweaks than anyone i&#039;d ever used in the past. but there were a couple of stylists hovering and all but demanding i get a cut and/or highlights, despite the fact that i&#039;d done both less than a week earlier. having a stranger touch my hair without an invitation, then criticize the work done by someone who works in the fashion industry, would have been laughable if it wasn&#039;t so creepy.

				This is for Divanatrix. I am the manager at Tsering Beauty Salon. First accept my appologies if u felt that we made u feel uncomfortable. Let me also take time to explain my side. We had some Spanish Hairstylists and they would chatter with clients in spanish, and i never had someone complain that they were pushy. I thought it was normal in their culture, but when u complained about it, I would have loved taht you would have given us a chance by telling us and not posting it up right away nways thats done. I made it clear to the stylist that they will not do that anymore.We also let one of them let go.&nbsp; Its been more than 5 months since stylists ever ask anyone for a haircut or matterfact anything else. Another thing i would like you to know is that we are a bunch of immigrants and we are trying our best to achieve our American dream. We have worked very hard to put together this place and i believe you will trust me when i say so. It is not in our culture to make fun of people and laugh like that. U probably felt like that because you just assumed that they were talking about you. Yes our girls are laughing chatting but never as far as i know they bad mouthed anybody. I am here to assure you that in our culture customer is like god. I know thats too much but its our culture. I am once again really sorry for loosing a customer. I hope one of these days you will forgive us and give us another chance..How about a fre mani-pedi and we get on good terms...<br />Peace<br />Buddha bless you<br />Tsering Beauty Salon

				wow thanks for the warning.!!! I am not the type to welcome people touching me&nbsp; without my consent (I once smacked a man in the mall for grabbing my shoulders for a massage).&nbsp; I also don&#039;t like pushy people.
