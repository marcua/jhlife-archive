John Rhys-Davies also stars in this bittersweet made-for-TV movie, which is based on Crisp&#039;s autobiography of the same name and caused considerable controversy when it first aired in 1975.<br /><br />Running time: 77 minutes<br />

					The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) review will be this Tuesday, December 7.&nbsp; The following points relate directly to the work the LPC does and, therefore, will likely receive consideration if mentioned (as opposed to issues outside the scope of the LPC)--<br />&nbsp;<br />* The building as designed does not provide green space along the 84th St. faÃ§ade unlike nearly every other similarly positioned 6-story building in Jackson Heights.<br />&nbsp;<br />* The building copies Georgian Hall, which is directly across 84th Street, too literally.&nbsp; Simply copying what is across the street shows laziness in design, defying our neighborhood&#039;s tradition of unique and identifiable buildings. <br />&nbsp;<br />* The building will block access to light and air for the southernmost windows of 35-43 84th St.&nbsp; Although &quot;lot line windows are not guaranteed&quot;--as we have heard countless times, blocking access runs contrary to Jackson Heights&#039;s reason for existing, at its inception and even today: to help residents escape the dark, towering, and cramped style of city living by allowing for open space, light, and air. <br />&nbsp;<br />* The Community Board was not adequately informed of the materials being used for this building before they voted. <br />&nbsp;<br />The LPC may require the owner to change his plans to address these issues, but we need to make these points clear to them.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to get involved.&nbsp; Here are some ways this can be done:<br /><br />Speak at the Hearing<br />&nbsp;<br />The LPC meets on Tuesday, December 7 at 1 Centre Street, 9th Floor Conference Room, the application for 84-01 will be heard at 3:45 pm and they are asking speakers to show up at 3 pm.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Council Member Dromm and other community leaders will be speaking.&nbsp; If you have the time, I would highly encourage you to speak at the hearing as long as it relates to the landmark issues and not, e.g., the nature of the fire.&nbsp; Also, so we can be sure to hit all the points, please approach Council Member Dromm&#039;s staff to let them know you are interested in speaking.<br /><br />Send a Written Statement<br />&nbsp;<br />If you can not attend the hearing, write a statement focused on the landmark issues.&nbsp; Let Council Member Dromm or his staff know (718-803-6373) so they can get the letter to the LPC.<br /><br />Sign and Distribute the Petition<br />&nbsp;<br />There is an online petition that can be used as well as a hard copy floating around: <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/840137thave/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/840137thave/</a><br /><br />Take it to the Press <br />&nbsp;<br />This week&#039;s Queens Chronicle ran the following short-sighted and uninformed editorial, towards the bottom of the page and entitled &quot;Save an Empty Lot?&quot;:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20451865&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=576258&amp;rfi=6" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20451865&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=576258&amp;rfi=6</a><br /><br />If you are so inclined, please contact the editor to let him/her know how you feel.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!<br />

					Statement by Council Member Daniel Dromm Regarding Storm Damage in Jackson Heights<br /><br />&nbsp;â€œToday many areas of my district were hard hit by a sudden storm.&nbsp; On 75th Street, where my office is located, two trees were destroyed by the storm.&nbsp; One tree split in half and the other fell across the street blocking traffic.&nbsp; Additionally, a construction fence was destroyed.&nbsp; The northbound side of 75th Street was closed to traffic by the NYPD. <br /><br />The police are on the scene and are now monitoring the situation.&nbsp; My office will work closely with the NYPD and the Parks Department to remove and replace the trees and to repair any damage to nearby property.<br /><br />People with other concerns should feel free to contact my office at 718-803-6373.&nbsp; We will try to assist them in any way we can.â€

					Thanks for the advice about being careful.&nbsp; I know it came out of neighborly concern.&nbsp; I will reiterate your point but with a few caveats.&nbsp; I want to be clear I am not blaming the victim for not taking precautions.&nbsp; Too often, victims, especially of gender- and sexual orientation-based violence, get blamed.<br /><br />Regardless of the motivation behind the incidents, I think everyone has the right to live in his or her community without the threat of violence at any hour.&nbsp; It is a sad state--that has unfortunately existed in many areas of this country to varying degrees at varying times--that people need to cautioned to walk outside.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to normalize such a situation.<br /><br />Having said that, these incidents have a dimension that others do not, namely the element of hate and intimidation directed at not just an individual but a whole group.&nbsp; Let&#039;s address the underlying issues.&nbsp; One observation that I have made is the sheer boldness of the machismo out there and the general acceptance among some people.&nbsp; What does it say when thousands of our neighbors vote for Hiram Monserrate AFTER his conviction and other troubles?<br /><br />Also, what about all the anti-gay words I hear in Spanish walking in this neighborhood?&nbsp; I just heard another one on Roosevelt Avenue tonight, probably directed at me.&nbsp; The Colombians who live in my building have similarly used derogatory terms toward me and seemed shocked when I confronted them.&nbsp; The use of the terms may be as racially motivated--my background is northern European--as they are motivated by perceived sexual orientation.&nbsp; As my Spanish improves, so does my awareness of the depth and breadth of the problem.&nbsp; I am not pinning all the blame on a certain group.&nbsp; I have lived in many different places and homophobia manifests itself in different ways in each place.&nbsp; There are non-Spanish-speaking people here who are also homophobic.&nbsp; I am pointing out the issue that has made itself most obvious through my personal experiences in Jackson Heights.

					I think it&#039;s great that many of our restaurants have really put Jackson Heights on the culinary map. &nbsp;It&#039;s one of the reasons I love living here. &nbsp;So, I am generally not one to speak up against a restaurant or another small business owner unless I feel something is seriously wrong.<br /><br />I dined at Chifa last night and was utterly disappointed.<br /><br />First, the wait for my food was tremendously long. &nbsp;At a Peruvian (fast!)/Chinese (even faster!) restaurant, I am ordering the fastest item on the menu: a half chicken. &nbsp;It takes a millisecond to chop my chicken with a cleaver. &nbsp;Why am I waiting nearly 40 minutes? &nbsp;The calamari I ordered as an appetizer was served before my chicken, but it was still a significant wait. &nbsp;What came out was a soggy, MSG-infused sampling of junior squid bits. &nbsp;Nothing like the crispy delight promised on the picture on the menu.<br /><br />The wait was not due to the fact Chifa was busy. &nbsp;There were at most four tables with customers and at least three people working the eating area. &nbsp;One appeared to be helping the takeout customers. &nbsp;As I left, one waiter was hunched over his fried rice at the bar-like area in the back.<br /><br />I noticed that other customers were also waiting a long time. &nbsp;The gentleman who came in after me and ordered something far more complex was served sooner than I was. &nbsp;That&#039;s not saying much; he also waited a considerable amount of time. &nbsp;Before he left, he turned to the couple sitting near him and appeared to be complaining (maybe about the food or the slow service). &nbsp;I could be wrong. &nbsp;Maybe I am transposing my frustration on him.<br /><br />When I politely asked where my dinner was, the waiter asked, &quot;Como?&quot; &nbsp;I didn&#039;t bother talking to any staff after that. Otherwise, the wait staff was not overtly rude and did refill my water and take my money fairly quickly. &nbsp;I think they perceived I was irritated and wanted to leave.<br /><br />What I was served was a lukewarm old chicken that was edible but still very clearly stewing in grease for a long time. &nbsp;The wings were dried rock solid. &nbsp;The rest of the chicken was slimy with fat and grease. &nbsp;The first thought that came to my head is that they did not have chicken but, instead of telling me, made a grocery store run to buy one, as crazy as that sounds. &nbsp;The green sauce that came with the chicken was the only saving grace since it helped the otherwise sad specimen of poultry go down. &nbsp;I asked for ketchup and got a few packets from the waiter, who reached into the big cardboard box on the table across from mine.<br /><br />The salad that came with my meal was a small side plate of chopped bits of old iceberg lettuce. &nbsp;No visible dressing. &nbsp;No other vegetables.<br /><br />I looked around and the dishes the other diners had in front of them seemed only marginally more appetizing.<br /><br />As for the atmosphere, it seems fairly clean. &nbsp;Other than that, it was shoddily designed. &nbsp;The row of booth seating against the wall is too narrow to allow even small people to sit comfortably. &nbsp;The furniture seems cheap, like it was recycled from a 70&#039;s Chinese takeout. &nbsp;The lighting fixtures seem new and modern and, thus, out of place. &nbsp;The men&#039;s bathroom door is not even really a proper room door but, rather, a hinged door to a supply closet. &nbsp;The walls and ceiling seem like they were left over from whatever was in there previously. &nbsp;The Latin music--mainly covers of popular Latin music by other Latin musicians--was not too loud, but when added to the soap opera that was playing on the TV in the back of the eating area, it was too much. &nbsp;The kitchen did not seem properly shielded from the public. &nbsp;(Either purposely expose the kitchen or hide the kitchen at a sit-down restaurant.) &nbsp;Boxes of supplies were on top of tables in the eating area. &nbsp;The whole restaurant just looked hastily thrown together.<br /><br />All of this would have been excusable had the food been as fabulous as indicated on JHL. &nbsp;I see that, save two people, all of the firsthand comments seem to be from people who joined JHL specifically to created and puff up this thread. &nbsp;Also, is it really right to attack Pio Pio if you are a business owner or manager, as I assume &quot;chifa_restaurant&quot; is? &nbsp;Shouldn&#039;t you really be concerned with providing quality food, service, and overall experience regardless of what other restaurants around you are doing? &nbsp;Restaurants are not cell phone service providers. &nbsp;I have no connection to Pio Pio&#039;s owner--I like some things about that restaurant (quality of food) but have some minor beefs about other things--but please run your business properly before pointing your own very greasy finger at others.<br />

					There are lots of raccoons around here.&nbsp; When I lived on both 76th Street and 77th Street, just south of Broadway, I saw these creatures a lot.&nbsp; Actually, I heard them fighting/mating more than I saw them.&nbsp; There are gangs of raccoons in the quiet spaces between many of the apartment buildings.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the proper word for a group of raccoons, but I think &quot;gang&quot; accurately describes their behavior.<br /><br />I also saw an opossum on my doorstep.&nbsp; At first, I thought it was a mutant rat!

					Looking for cool people from all over the world who definitely want to meet their neighbors?&nbsp; Here are a few suggestions from my own experience.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; New Visions Democratic Club - If politics is your thing, this is the activity for you.&nbsp; This club really reflects the diversity of the neighborhood.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Queens LGBT Pride - The first Sunday in June every year, the LGBT folks put on the production, and the whole neighborhood comes out to enjoy.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Make the Road, NICE, and many others - There are so many opportunities to meet recent immigrants who are involved in the community.&nbsp; Attend a march or rally.&nbsp; Volunteer to help teach English.&nbsp; Get involved!&nbsp; :coolsmiley:

					Sears and Monserrate will lose.&nbsp; It is not a foregone conclusion, but Peralta&#039;s support is strong.&nbsp; He also seems to be running a smart campaign.&nbsp; There are enough people in the district who are SO over Sears and Monserrate.&nbsp; What is also important to remember, for registered Democrats, is defeating Sears and Monserrate in their races in September for their respective Democratic District Leader positions.&nbsp; Unless I am mistaken, they are both currently party officials.
