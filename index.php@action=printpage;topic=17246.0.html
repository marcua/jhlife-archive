				http://qns.com/story/2017/11/09/bloomingdales-will-move-1000-jobs-new-long-island-city-development/<br /><br />(http://2sei0v2s93y31n9ndy1lrzmh.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/JACX-6-1024x576.jpg)<br /><br />About 1,000 Bloomingdale’s employees will move to into a new two-building complex being constructed in Long Island City, according to the New York Post.<br /><br />Macy’s will lease 550,000 square feet of space at The Jacx, which will be located at 28-01 Jackson Ave. The developer Tishman Speyer seeks to set “the new standard for creative office development” with two 26-story buildings. In total, the buildings will consist of 1.2 million acres of office and retail space with a 1-acre terrace on the fifth floor.<br /><br />Bloomingdale’s Chief Executive Tony Spring, merchandise buyers, IT workers and clerical staff will move to Long Island City from other Manhattan offices in 2020, the New York Post reported.<br /><br />“Macy’s, Inc. is excited to announce that, in 2020, the Bloomingdales New York City corporate and support teams will move to a vibrant new campus in Long Island City in The JACX,” spokesperson Radina Russell told QNS. “The move will foster a more collaborative work environment, give the company additional location flexibility, and increase the diversity of benefits we offer to our employees as we continue to recruit talent.”<br /><br />The 50,000 square feet of retail space at The Jacx will include a gourmet market, food hall, restaurants, a coffee shop and a bouquet fitness center. The outdoor terrace, called “The Quad,” can be used for “events like theater, music and dance nights,” according to the development’s website.<br /><br />An on-site valet garage will have space for 550 cars and 175 bike spaces. The JACX is more than 70 percent pre-leased to fashion and tech companies including WeWork, a co-working space moving into a 250,000-square-foot location.<br /><br />It is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.

				Thanks for posting. This is an interesting development, and I&#039;m glad to see the economic and cultural importance of Queens grow. <br /><br />What I worry about is whether -- and how fast -- infrastructure development will catch up. What I&#039;d like to see is parallel investment in various infrastructure projects that will help sustain that growth.

				I will say, I’m very curious to see how the Plaxall plan (the second one) plays out. The Plaxall family has always been very supportive of the LIC community. They’re normally in some way behind the various grassroots community events that take place.
