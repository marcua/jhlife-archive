And posters are fools if they think they can change or shut down anyone&#039;s political opinion. Empirical evidence shows they can&#039;t. People seem immune to being trolled on this forum!<br /><br />Any attempts at trolling here are more a power trip, is my observation. And funnily enough don&#039;t work in the slightest. Ever. And only show a poster&#039;s agenda as obvious...as though they have a neon sign saying &quot;This is my agenda&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Still, the article is interesting. And it&#039;s good that folks be vigilant about any patterns in public forums that they observe. Knowledge is power.<br /><br />

				There&#039;s more range for nuance in people&#039;s political views than is generally given credit in this forum.&nbsp; For example bemoaning young people &quot;jumping on the Trump band wagon&quot; ignores the possibility of people feeling actually abandoned by the left and turning (however reluctantly in some cases) to the apparent alternative.&nbsp; Or perhaps those with rather moderate political views seeing the radical left swing in culture and finding themselves now pushed toward the right wing.&nbsp; Instead of trying to undertsnad these non-polar positions, people get labelled and degraded as being bigots and racists.<br /><br />People aren&#039;t trying to understand other people&#039;s points of views.&nbsp; It&#039;s a sign of the constructed climate of societal destabilization we find ourselves in.&nbsp; Every issue no matter how big or small becomes an ideological point.&nbsp; Every non-conforming post becomes a battleground for right-think.<br /><br />However I don&#039;t see this as the forum&#039;s fault at all, what is a forum but the expressions of the people in it?&nbsp; In a hypothetical time of less political polarization I could see the same people having more constructive discussions.&nbsp; Hypothetically.

				Making no mention here of accepting or rejecting others&#039; opinions. However, as our late Senator Moynihan is said to have said, &quot;Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.&quot; And in point of fact, arguments <em>are</em> won and lost -- just consider any competition between debate teams. One of the points in the <em>Guardian</em> article is that shifts in value judgements can occur when detailed facts that answer the question How are requested or presented (rather than solely appealing to emotional opinion). <br /><br />And precisely that factually informed sort of discussion might even prevent public forums like this one from being &quot;highjacked&quot; by all manner of zealots -- even if the likelihood of successfully reasoning with the irrational is admittedly never that great.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace out.

				People can&#039;t even agree on the definition of words, let alone what facts are.&nbsp; I consider this a discussion board, Not a place to find out who is right or wrong.&nbsp; Some want to engage in that way, and others don&#039;t. All I&#039;m saying is that those who are here trying to prove to other people that they are right are ultimately in for disappointment.&nbsp; Noone is interested in who is &quot;right&quot;.<br /><br />I agree with abcdefghijk the problem is the non-acceptance of plurality of thoughts and ideas.&nbsp; Instead you have people raging that other people are wrong for not holding the same opinions as they and then in the same sentence bemoan the absence of &quot;diversity&quot;.
