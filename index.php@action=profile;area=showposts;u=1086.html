					Hi JudgeSadie,<br /><br />I think we chatted on this board a while back. &nbsp;I am also in the Terrace View. &nbsp;At the moment I think there are two 2BRs available in the building, plus a full 3BR (mine). &nbsp;I am listed with Helen Van Rhyn at Brown Harris Stevens. &nbsp;Here is a link to the listing for my place, in case you&#039;re interested: &nbsp;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bhsusa.com/queens/7910-34th-avenue/coop/1139963" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.bhsusa.com/queens/7910-34th-avenue/coop/1139963</a><br /><br />Just so you know, she will be running open houses next week and probably the week after that as well, in case you wanted to have a first hand look. &nbsp;We have actually fully renovated the place, and that&#039;s reflected in our asking price. &nbsp;Frankly, to do a renovation to the scale that we&#039;ve done here will probably cost someone $80,000, plus all the headaches of getting various contractors in and out, and a lot of time as well. &nbsp;Everything in the bathrooms and kitchen is new and up to date. &nbsp;We substantially upgraded the electrical system as well.<br /><br />In addition to our place, I am aware of Robert Insirello&#039;s listing that LuzMarie mentioned. &nbsp;He had at least a couple of 2BR apartments that were estate sales, in need of full renovations, and they were priced accordingly. &nbsp;Both of these listings have gone into contract and are no longer on the market. &nbsp;Since they have been sold, the market seems to have improved, so we should start seeing better prices in this building. &nbsp;Robert has a 2BR that he just listed. &nbsp;That apartment, while likely well kept, probably is in need of modernization. &nbsp;You may want to have a look at that one. &nbsp;I think he is asking $369K for it, but check with him. &nbsp;In addition, I am aware that Michael Carfagna has a 2BR listed (without a terrace). &nbsp;Check his web site. &nbsp;Also, there was a sponsor 2BR apartment that came on the market a couple of weeks ago, asking $395K, and has already gone into contract. &nbsp;So things are moving up here. &nbsp;If you are interested in a place in this building (or anywhere, for that matter), I think now is the time to make your move. &nbsp;Prices are not going to get any lower, and interest rates are also not likely to be any better than they are right now, and in fact I can only see them moving higher.<br /><br />In addition to the full 2BR listings on the market here, there are, I think, one or two junior 4 apartments (full 1 BRs with a fairly large dining room that can be used as second bedroom).<br /><br />Finally, Helen (my broker) also had a listing in the Greystones that she sold (offer accepted) within a week or two of putting it on the market, and she also has a 2Br in the Elm Court (that&#039;s the complex right behind our building, has a garden) that is asking in the mid 500K range, and they&#039;ve had an offer as well (they rejected it).<br /><br />Hope this helps. &nbsp;Again, if you have your heart set on this building, I would recommend you make your move now. &nbsp;Whether it&#039;s my place or someone else&#039;s, the real estate market is getting more active and is definitely much better than it was a year ago. &nbsp;Nice space won&#039;t last long.<br /><br />Good luck, whatever you decide to do.<br /><br />Cheers / TheMariner

We&#039;re looking to buy. I&#039;ve looked at loads of apartments and we&#039;ve settled on wanting a 2BR. Does anyone know of any available? <br />Looks like we&#039;ll be avoiding Donner Gardens! (In truth, the name reminded me too much of the Donner party. Maybe I should have taken the hint!)<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just make sure you are not confusing Donner Gardens (which is over on 81st/82nd between 34th Ave and Northern) with Donnelly Gardens (which is only a couple of blocks away, occupying the block between 78th/79th Streets and 34th/35th Ave).&nbsp; Donnelly is a decent development, with a garden space - although there are nicer garden developments in the nabe.&nbsp; Rooms are not all that big in Donnelly apartments, either.&nbsp; But, they&#039;re cheaper than other co-ops, and many of the garden apartments are really amalgamations of several small building associations (10 shareholders) that share a common garden.&nbsp; Owning in a small co-op brings it&#039;s own problems, issues and headaches - everything is more personal, and you are more actively involved with building management.&nbsp; That suits some, but for others, it&#039;s a pain.&nbsp; A bigger place doesn&#039;t have those issues.&nbsp; When I searched for Donner Gardens, first thing that popped up was a real estate broker&#039;s ad for 121 apartments being sold as unsold sponsor shares.&nbsp; This would be a big red flag for me, for this particular building.<br /><br />Good luck in your search for a suitable unit.<br /><br />Mariner

					I live in The Terrace View, in an apartment on the front of the building, lower floor.&nbsp; I DO NOT repeat DO NOT hear the Mr. Softee truck here.<br /><br />I would rather the truck didn&#039;t sit at the park, simply because my kids annoy me to no end for ice cream when they go to the park <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/lipsrsealed.gif" alt="&#58;-X" title="Lips sealed" class="smiley" /> .....$2 or $3 (per kid) strikes me as a bit rich, particularly considering the (poor) quality of the goop they serve up....but that&#039;s another topic.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven&#039;t been disturbed by the Mister Softee jingle in my place.&nbsp; Hope this answers your concerns.<br /><br />M78

I am interested in stripping my old radiators and would like to know if there are any recommendations or better yet, where do I start?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a messy, dirty, and horribly labor intensive job.&nbsp; Are you currently living in the place, or are you renovating a currently vacant apartment ??&nbsp; &nbsp;also, is the heat on in them ??<br /><br />If your radiators currently have heat coming through them (i.e., if they are hot), I wouldn&#039;t even consider doing this until the spring, because extra heat will drive the chemicals into the air, and into your lungs and anyone else nearby.&nbsp; I recently stripped all my radiator covers and windowframes, (not the radiators themselves, thank God), and also the steam return pipes in the bathrooms, and spray painted all of them (came out beautifully, but the job took weeks).&nbsp; I used a product called Peel-Away, which takes a long time, but is much less toxic than products with methylene chloride (which I also used, and it&#039;s much quicker than the PeelAway).&nbsp; Both of these are available in the paint section at Home Depot, BTW.<br /><br />How they worked: <br /><br />PeelAway is a product that you spread on, then cover with some special paper that&#039;s included.&nbsp; You need to trim the paper to the job.&nbsp; You brush on the peelAway (GENEROUSLY), then cover it with the paper.&nbsp; You then WAIT ABOUT 2-4 DAYS, then pull/scrape the paper off.&nbsp; Most of the paint will come off with it.&nbsp; The longer you wait, the deeper the penetration into the old paint.&nbsp; You may have to follow up to get the residual bits, or deeper layers.&nbsp; Once you get most of the initial paint off, you can hit it again with PeelAway, just put it on and wait a few minutes, then get it off with a scraper or steel wool.&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to wear gloves and you should wear a mask, but it&#039;s not too bad.&nbsp; Anything that&#039;s left, you need to get after with a methylene chloride based stripper.&nbsp; You can get it in a spray can.&nbsp; It is nasty, vile stuff, but it will clean up anything that&#039;s left.&nbsp; Get a good RESPIRATOR or filter type mask - spend the $25 that it&#039;s going to cost for this piece of equipment.&nbsp; Methylene Chloride is not good to breath, you will get dizzy, light headed, and a little headachy. (see here: <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/423.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/423.html</a>).&nbsp; But it will get the last bits off.&nbsp; ALWAYS wear thick gloves, esp with Methylene chloride strippers.&nbsp; And not just the thick $5 rubber gloves for heavy duty cleaning.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking the really thick rubber ones that come up halfway on your elbows.&nbsp; Wear clothes you intend to throw away after the job, too.&nbsp; AND W@EAR A SERIOUS AIR FILTRATION MASK, not just a dust mask.&nbsp; Open ALL of the windows.<br /><br />If you can&#039;t take the time to use the peelaway, use the methylene chloride stripper, but (again), all of the above cautionary notes apply.&nbsp; It will do the job, but it&#039;s nasty, vile stuff.<br /><br />After you strip it, I suppose you will want to paint it.&nbsp; MAKE SURE TO USE PAINT THAT TOLERATES HIGH HEAT.&nbsp; This goes for the steam return lines that everyone has in their bathrooms as well (usually a pipe that&#039;s hot in the winter and located in a corner of the bathroom somewhere).&nbsp; Rustoleum makes a good high heat paint, it&#039;s available in 4 colors at Home Depot in spray paint cans.&nbsp; Again, there&#039;s lots of problems using spray paint in your home, cover everything in the entire room, then seal the bottom of the doors with tape while you&#039;re painting (it will get under the door and onto the floor just outside the door if you don&#039;t).&nbsp; The high heat spray paint does seem to not fly as far as regular spray paint (which I repainted all my windowframes with).&nbsp; Wear a respirator with this too.<br /><br />Hope this advice helps you.&nbsp; Good luck with the job.&nbsp; <br /><br />TheMariner<br />

					I live in the Terrace View.&nbsp; The R line is 2BRs, faces the back of the building and has no terraces.&nbsp; Two bedrooms, one bath, one half bath (I lived in an &quot;R&quot;).<br /><br />D Line is 2BRs, has a terrace, has two baths, one full bath and a bathroom in the master suite with a shower (I call it a 3/4 baths).<br /><br />The &quot;C&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; lines have three BRs, terrace, and same bathroom setup as the D line (one full and one bathroom with a shower in the Master suite).&nbsp; Also a very large front closet (4 x 8 feet, it&#039;s like a storage locker). Nice set-up.<br /><br />Why are you asking ??&nbsp; Looking to buy ??<br /><br />FO2
