Please contact @lilylilylily on Twitter.*<br /><br /><br />--- Quote ---@lilylilylily NYC friends: My neighbor passed away due to covid-19 &amp; his two cats are in need of a new, loving home. Suzi (f, 11) &amp; Sammy (m, 8) are healthy, adorable kitties. It would be ideal for them to be adopted together. Please let me know if you&#039;re interested, or spread the word. They need to be adopted by the end of the month, which is when my neighbor&#039;s apartment will be taken over by management. Any help in getting the word out is much appreciated! DMs open for inquiries<br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />https://twitter.com/lilylilylily/status/1274821355297558528
