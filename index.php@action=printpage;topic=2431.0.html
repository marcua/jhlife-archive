				I think the silence (so far) on this topic speaks volumes.... the Chinese restaurants in the JH area leave much to be desired! <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where their delivery area ends, but King Wah on Northern Boulevard at 69th Street gets my nod of approval.

				I&#039;m addicted to #105 at King Wah which is Chicken &amp; Spinach with garlic (they serve brown rice). &nbsp;I live fairly close by so I pick up and take home. &nbsp;I know someone who lives in the high 80&#039;s that has delivery. &nbsp;Also, J J Garden Chinese at 75-21 31st Ave (Mall that houses Waldbaum&#039;s) delivers to Jackson Heights in the 70&#039;s but I&#039;m not certain about the 80&#039;s. &nbsp;Call &nbsp;718 898-6686. &nbsp;I imagine if order is large enough, they&#039;ll deliver to the high 80&#039;s. &nbsp;

				I&#039;m a <strong>big </strong> fan of JJ Chans Garden in East Elmhurst.&nbsp; I live close enough to get it for takeout, but occasionally have it delivered as well.&nbsp; I prefer it to all the ghetto chinese type places.&nbsp; Also they deliver by car, so I&#039;d imagine their delivery zone is larger than those that only have bicycle delivery.<br /><br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/j-j-chans-garden-east-elmhurst<br />

				Wow, I haven&#039;t tried any of these places.&nbsp; I&#039;ve settled down on ordering from East21 which is on Roosevelt in the... 70s?<br /><br />They deliver all the way to my place on 86th and 34th.

				Somehow I have missed this thread completely or I would have piped up earlier.&nbsp; I second JJ Chan- they have a decent setup (not fast-food tacky) and they serve more than passable Chinese.

				So many responses thanks! I&#039;ll have to try them all. Now just a question is oyster sauce actually made from oysters? Just wondering like duck sauce is not made from ducks. What is in garlic sauce?

				I think you&#039;re asking this because you&#039;re a vegetarian? I&#039;m a vegetarian, and I can tell you that garlic sauce is not made from any meat (and I define meat as including fish, chicken, etc).&nbsp; Not sure about oyster sauce.&nbsp; I do not believe it&#039;s made from oysters, but don&#039;t take my word for it.

				Here&#039;s some info on oyster sauce from Wisegeek.com:<br /><br /><em><strong>&quot;Oyster sauce is a flavorful, savory sauce which is Chinese in origin. As the name implies, oyster sauce is traditionally made with oysters, although it is also possible to find vegetarian versions.&quot; </strong></em><br /><br />And if you&#039;d like to read more about it:<br /><br />What is Oyster Sauce?

				yes I was told by a friend (who is philipino not chinese) that garlic sauce has oyster sauce in it Now Im not sure if its the chinese version of garlic sauce?? I&#039;ve asked everytime ordering but still don&#039;t trust them because i think there was a language barrier. I usually just order steamed veg, dumplings/rice etc

				Forget JH for anything other than &quot;Take Out&quot; style. Get yourself over to Elmhurst, it is considered one of NYC 5&nbsp; Asian communities. Broadway Seafood, just past Whitney Ave, is traditional, with a HUGE dim sum. The whole stretch of Broadway starting from Elmhurst hospital all the way up to Queens Blvd. is a gold mine of various regional Chinese restaurants. Some have limited English but you can still get by. For the full experience go to the buffet at East on Albion Avenue and Queens Blvd. 8.99 during the week for lunch and you will be astounded.

				Another excellent choice in Elmhurst is Lin&#039;s Taiwanese Gourmet located at 84-02 Broadway.&nbsp; I always dine in but they do indicate on the menu that they have delivery but I&#039;m not sure if it includes JH&#039;s.&nbsp;
