				Age is showing here&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Back then I used to bring groups of high schoolers over from East Harlem for a fun night out.&nbsp; They were amazed that someone my age could skate!&nbsp; Hmmph!!&nbsp; Of course age is really revenge in slow motion, so now their kids are amazed at what they can still do at their age!!&nbsp; So old. So young. So relative.&nbsp; :coolsmiley:
