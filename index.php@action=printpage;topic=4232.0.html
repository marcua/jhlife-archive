				Don&#039;t sit out the special election and don&#039;t let your neighbors do so either!&nbsp; Hiram will run and he has a lot of fans in other sections of his district.&nbsp; He is now seen as a scapegoat or a victim by some too so people are actively trying to get out the vote in his favor.

				<br />Campaign Goes After Opponents of Gay Marriage<br />By JEREMY W. PETERS<br />ALBANY â€” Angered by the defeat last year of a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to marry, a group of well-financed gay rights advocates has started a political action committee to take aim aggressively at state senators who have opposed same-sex marriage. <br /><br />The first person the committee will single out is Hiram Monserrate, the Queens Democrat who has filed as a candidate in a special election to reclaim the seat he lost after the Senate expelled him this month. <br /><br />The campaign against Mr. Monserrate, which will initially rely on the Internet and direct mail to reach voters but may expand to phone banks and e-mail, could exceed a cost of $100,000 â€” a significant amount for a legislative special election that is less than three weeks away. <br /><br />In total, the political action committee, called Fight Back New York, is prepared to raise and spend in the high six figures range in the State Senate races this year, according to people involved with the committee. <br /><br />Financing and organization will come, in part, from some of the most politically sophisticated and financially powerful gay rights advocates in the country. Tim Gill, a philanthropist and former software developer who has backed many gay rights initiatives nationwide, is a major player, along with some of his top associates and donors to his causes. <br /><br />â€œPoliticians who deny gays and lesbians basic equality should be thrown out of office, starting with convicted criminal Hiram Monserrate,â€ said Bill Smith, an adviser to the committee and deputy executive director of the Gill Action Fund, the political arm of Mr. Gillâ€™s foundation, which is based in Denver. <br /><br />The committee will start going after Mr. Monserrate, who was convicted of assaulting his female companion in a confrontation that left her requiring more than 20 stitches, by mailing fliers this week to voters in his district. The flier shows still frames of a surveillance video that shows him dragging his companion, Karla Giraldo, through the hallway of his apartment building in Jackson Heights, Queens. He was acquitted of a felony assault charge by a judge, who convicted him of misdemeanor assault. <br /><br />â€œHe brutally assaulted a woman and tried to cover up his crime,â€ the flier says. â€œNow he has the nerve to run again. Many of us have voted for Hiram before. But we cannot vote for him again.â€ <br /><br />In the three weeks that remain before the election, Fight Back New York expects to send out at least five different fliers, upwards of 100,000 pieces of mail. The districtâ€™s population is around 300,000, but voter turnout in special elections is typically quite low. <br /><br />Mr. Monserrate, who would run as an independent, is facing Assemblyman Jose Peralta, a Democrat supported by the party and many leading Democrats. <br /><br />The political action committeeâ€™s Web site, in both English and Spanish, takes an even harsher line against Mr. Monserrate. It is scheduled to go live on Thursday and describes him in bold print as a â€œcriminalâ€ and â€œincompetent.â€ The site will also be used as a fund-raising tool to solicit and accept donations. <br /><br />The Gill Action Fund and many of its donors were significant players in the 2008 legislative elections, helping to funnel around $1 million into local races in anticipation of same-sex marriage legislation. Senate Democrats picked up two seats, capturing the majority for the first time in a generation, but that was not enough to prevent the chamber from rejecting same-sex marriage. <br /><br />While Fight Back New York has not decided which senators it will single out this fall, the groupâ€™s organizers plan to focus on races where they believe the incumbent has a challenger who strongly supports gay rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />__._,_.___<br />Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post | Start a New Topic <br />Messages in this topic (1) <br />Recent Activity: New Members 9 <br />Visit Your Group <br />&nbsp;Switch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest â€¢ Unsubscribe â€¢ Terms of Use.<br />&nbsp;<br />__,_._,___

				FROM JOEMYGOD.COM<br />Heavy Hitting New PAC Takes Aim At Anti-Marriage Equality NY Politicians <br /><br />The powerful Gill Action Fund has joined with other well-financed LGBT activists to create a new political action committee called Fight Back New York, who plans to target the state senators who voted against December&#039;s marriage equality bill. First to face the ire of this new coalition is recently expelled NY Sen. Hiram Monserrate, who is running to re-take his seat in a March 16th special election. <br />The committee will start going after Mr. Monserrate, who was convicted of assaulting his female companion in a confrontation that left her requiring more than 20 stitches, by mailing fliers this week to voters in his district. The flier shows still frames of a surveillance video that shows him dragging his companion, Karla Giraldo, through the hallway of his apartment building in Jackson Heights, Queens. He was acquitted of a felony assault charge by a judge, who convicted him of misdemeanor assault. â€œHe brutally assaulted a woman and tried to cover up his crime,â€ the flier says. â€œNow he has the nerve to run again. Many of us have voted for Hiram before.

The districtâ€™s population is around 300,000, but voter turnout in special elections is typically quite low. Mr. Monserrate, who would run as an independent, is facing Assemblyman Jose Peralta, a Democrat supported by the party and many leading Democrats. <br />In related news, the Empire State Pride Agenda has launched &quot;Don&#039;t Get Mad, Get Even,&quot; a campaign in support of Monserrate&#039;s opponent, Assemblyman Jose Peralta. Visit the above link to donate to Peralta&#039;s very short but important NY Senate election bid. Monserrate has formed a new party he is calling &quot;Yes We Can&quot; (seriously) and will not be running as a Democrat. <br /><br />Adding to the &quot;only in New York&quot; bizarreness, former NYC Councilwoman Helen Sears has decided to cross party lines and run against Monserrate and Peralta as a Republican. And the broken down clown car known as the New York Senate wobbles on.

				Here&#039;s the NY Assembly site for Jose Peralta. http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=039&amp;sh=sponsor This lists all the legislation he has sponsored. You can click on each legislation to get a summary of such legislation. You can also view a list of the committees he belongs to.<br /><br />It&#039;s not helpful that the NY Senate site has completely removed Monseratte&#039;s sponsored bills and bills he introduced. I wish I could read the raw copy of the bills he supported. Here&#039;s an interview Monseratte gave to the Queens Courier: http://queenscourier.com/articles/2010/03/09/news/top_stories/doc4b8d7ba730c62289356659.prt. I&#039;m curious to know what are the three laws he introduced and passed in the Senate. If anyone has this information from a reliable source please post a link. Also, today (Wednesday march 10) there will be a forum with the three candidates at Pride House on 37th Avenue between 76th and 77th. Right across from the Supermarket. Second floor. Hope to see you guys there.

				From the yesterdays&#039; Observer:<br /><br />Hiram Monserrate got in trouble recently for poaching Barack Obama&#039;s slogan and logo.<br /><br />Now, on his web site, Monserrate features not only a picture of former Mayor David Dinkins--who has not endorsed anyone in this race--but also a two-year-old campaign video featuring Bryan Pu-Folkes, a local activist who no longer supports Monserrate.<br /><br />I have a call into Dinkins&#039; office for comment.<br /><br />Pu-Folkes&#039; campaign manager said they did not authorize the current use of Pu-Folkes&#039; comments in the latest video, and were set to issue a press release criticizing Monserrate for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Pu-Folkes is out with a statement saying Monserrate isn&#039;t fit for office. <br /><br />&quot;In light of multiple transgressions, Hiram Monserrate is not in a position to effectively and honorably represent our communities.&nbsp; &nbsp; We are facing an unprecedented fiscal and ethical crisis in Albany and we need leaders who will be the solution and not part of the problem,&quot; Pu-Folkes said.<br /><br />http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/monserrate-using-dinkins-pu-folkes-web-site<br />

				It was a nice evening of political theater. HM was of course his defiant obnoxious self. Jose Peralta came across as calm and professional. I can&#039;t remember the Republican candidates name, nor much of what he said. For the most part it seemed like he didn&#039;t even want to be there. Hiram of course encountered a lot of hecklers, my self being one of them at times, though not nearly as vocal as a certain red haired gentleman sitting next to me. <br /><br />HM did mention that he got $5m in funding for expanding Travers Park, but Jose was quick to point out that that money was merely a proposal as it hasn&#039;t been approved by the assembly.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of Jose&#039;s strongest points was that Hiram was expelled from the senate by a vote of 53 to 8 I believe, so how can he be expected to work well with the 53 senators that voted to expel him ? Makes sense to me.<br /><br />One of the more interesting moments was this guy in the front row who had a red lipstick with him. Every time Hiram spoke he smeared his face with it, signifying the blood on Carla Giraldo&#039;s face. It must have gotten to Hiram who eventually told the guy the lipstick was cute, but not quite his color. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				the NY1 debate had something to offer. i wish beltrani would have had something to say .... but he didn&#039;t. in the end, i don&#039;t think anyone would be talked into changing their mind by what transpired. but it was useful. <br /><br />it was funny to hear monserrate say that he has always been independent and never had any contact with the democratic party machine. but maybe that&#039;s just me speaking as someone with an attention span of more than 23 seconds.

				This article is very hard on Jose. While I agree there are some questions, I believe that Jose has been a good representative for the community. He has been responsive to the constituents and the area in general. He has worked with youth groups, schools, healthcare, and quality of life issues. <br /><br />I am a cynic, politics is a basically dirty game and I feel that basically politics has been a dirty game for years. In order to get into the game, one has to play with the big boys and those games aren&#039;t always what we like to read about. <br /><br />Yes, Jose does ignore certain topics when in a debate but Hiram can&#039;t answer anything without without being slime. While Hiram may have some interesting ideas, the abusive conviction, the missing $400,000 to El Libre (also missing organization), the revolt and double cross in the Senate this summer and his just slimy personality is just too much to overcome. I was at the debate the other night and also watch the one on NY1 and I could listen to Hiram without feeling disgusted. I do not believe he will be quality representative for us. I do not feel that he can work with the Senate in any concrete or positive way.<br /><br />Hiram cited the Congressional ouster of former representative Adam Clayton Powell during the NY1 debate. Powell was ousted from the Congress because of corruption. While the courts questioned the ouster the negative have held up all these years. I believe the negatives of Hiram will also be found to be deep and unacceptable.<br /><br /><br />So, we will vote for Jose and have better representation and have positives for JH.

				After seeing the 3 candidates on Thursday in our neighborhood and also watching them last night on NY1, I indeed feel like I am voting for the lesser of&nbsp; evils.&nbsp; Hiram has to answer for his violent behavior but Jose blatantly lied on at least two points last night and he seems to have his own &quot;skeletons in the closet&quot; as far as allegations of missing funds.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see that he&#039;s really all that smart and, if we&#039;re going for the best as far as having the ability to maneuver in political circles and B.S. with the big dogs, Hiram, for all his faults, seems to have that talent.&nbsp; He seems much move clever and, let&#039;s face it, they&#039;re all pretty much full of themselves and full of --it.<br /><br />I felt the most straightforward and plainly honest response at the Candidates&#039; Night was uttered by Mr. Beltrani when he said that he would like to garner political capital by pledging that a Community Center would go in one of the empty spaces on 37th Ave. but that the budget shortfalls would preclude that from happening.<br /><br />Yes, I will vote for Mr. Peralta because he&#039;s not Hiram but we truly deserve much better than the whole lot of them.

				Madalyn - totally agree.<br /><br />The debates (both of them) were very telling. We have 3 candidates that are not the best. One is definitely the <em>best of the worst </em> - so to day I support Peralta. As a cynic, I don&#039;t like politicians - they are in a very dirty business. Idealism would have a shining knight riding in to save the day. No this time.<br /><br /><strong>We vote for Peralta because the other two would be disaster.<br /><em>I vote for Peralta because is is not Hiram.</em><br />I vote for Peralta because I feel I have to.<br />If we don&#039;t vote for Peralta we might get Hiram</strong><br /><br />What a way to think and feel.<br />However, this has been the way I have felt in too many elections recently.<br /><br />So reality says <strong>VOTE FOR PERALTA</strong>.

				I vote for Peralta because it is so obviously a step up, and because he is for the civil rights of gay men and women. As far as I&#039;m concerned, the ladder reason is enough of a reason why everyone should vote Hiriam out, which I feel most certainly compelled to do.

				I just watched the NY1 debate from their web site. I don&#039;t know if anyone else feels this way, but Peralta did not strike me as being entirely honest. He equivocated something awful when confronted with his incendiary campaign literature, and it seemed as though every answer he gave defaulted to his list of endorsements. As this was my first time seeing him or hearing him speak, I was a little disappointed with his disingenuous-ness. He seems to be just another slimy politician out for personal or political gain. Bummer.<br /><br />This being said, Monserrate (admittedly, expectedly,) really disgusted me. I couldn&#039;t believe the way he accused Peralta of victimizing his ex-girlfriend with his campaign literature, as though he had any kind of leg to stand on in invoking her rights. He came off as arrogant and conceited. He cast his assault conviction as a &quot;personal issue&quot; in his life, as though it isn&#039;t the business of the public to care that their elected representative is a batterer. The idea that women, especially, should just look the other way and simply consider the bills the guy&#039;s proposed, without any thought to the fact that Monserrate is a violent offender, is simply outrageous. There is no way I would ever vote for this guy.<br /><br />I guess that I, too, will be voting for the best of the worst. It&#039;s unfortunate.<br /><br />

				Marlene - politics is slimy - just that simple.<br /><br />From Today&#039;s YourNabe.com:<br />A federal appeals court on Friday denied former state Sen.

				Both the fellows lied at the debates.<br /><br />Monserrate claim legislation that is not his or hasn&#039;t been enacted. His literature has lied and claims that are far from truth - i.e. computer labs in every school. Monserrate is a convicted abuser - ok a misdemeanor but convicted. Monserrate gave $400 thousand to an &quot;community organization (El Libre) that never existed, never filed taxes and can&#039;t be found. Monerrate published horrible campaign literature slamming opponent. Monserrate promises funds and awards to community groups and does not follow through.<br /><br />Peralta didn&#039;t acknowledge ownership of campaign literature that is just as terrible as his opponent&#039;s when he did own it. Peralta gave money to a community organization that did exist but doesn&#039;t now - and the funds were stopped. This organization was also given funds from Schumer and Crowley. Peralta doesn&#039;t answer questions during debates and comes across as not too bright. Peralta is active in all areas of the community.<br /><br />They both have positives and negative. However, <br />&nbsp;- Monserrate overall more negative, is more of a liar, more of a person with a questionable if not shady past. - --- - Monserrate was convicted as an abuser<br />&nbsp;- Monserrate voted against the life wish of a large constituent group when he voted no on the marriage law.<br />&nbsp;- Monserrate &nbsp;shut the state senate down with his compatriot Espada.<br /><br />Peralta keeps winning this pro / con debate.<br />VOTE PERALTA<br />&nbsp;

				I see where you&#039;re going with this, but just playing devil&#039;s advocate for a second:<br /><br />As a constituent, I will most likely never be so physically close to an elected official that he will have the chance to injure me with broken glass.&nbsp; However, I don&#039;t need to be in the same room for him to be able to steal money from me any time he wants!<br /><br />That said, I really don&#039;t think we can boil this election down to slash vs. steal.&nbsp; And such a sad state of affairs if we could!

I&#039;d say a broken bottle is a &quot;dangerous instrument&quot; and that by slashing her across the face Monserrate had &quot;intent to cause serious physical injury.&quot;<br /><br />The only reason that this guy was not charged with (and convicted of) a felony is because he was a state senator. If a poor person living in the projects or a random person of color had been charged for the same crime, you had better believe that they&#039;d have gotten slapped with one of the felony charges. People don&#039;t usually get to slash each other across the face such that 40 stitches are needed and walk.

				Are we talking about the mailer which has the picture of HM&#039;s arrest on it ? &nbsp;If so, the Peralta campaign has acknowledged that it&#039;s there&#039;s and I don&#039;t understand what the big deal is. The mailer illustrates an actual event that happened and we all saw on the news the next day. Hiram&#039;s girlfriend did get 41 stitches, Hiram was arrested, Hiram was convicted of a misdemeanor. This is all publicly available information that has been verified, why is it wrong for the Peralta campaign to point this out ?<br /><br />If we&#039;re talking about a flyer sent from another organization, then I still don&#039;t see what the problem is, what is advertised in these mailings is verifiable truth, not slanderous lies. <br /><br />The homophobic literature describing Peralta as the &quot;Gay Caballero&quot; is much more disturbing, especially since Hiram won&#039;t denounce it. Even though he voted against marriage equality he has said that he is a supporter of the gay community then why won&#039;t he denounce these anonymous and slanderous smears ? This is eerily reminiscent of the flyers the sears campaign &quot;had nothing to do with&quot; during her race against Council Member Dromm. Why do people assume that homophobia wins votes ? This only further serves to show Hiram up for who / what he really is, a biggot.

				I&#039;m talking about the 10+ mailings, almost all of which feature Monserrate&#039;s crime, which came from Fight Back New York. &nbsp;The literature I received from the Peralta campaign has been mostly about Peralta. &nbsp;I haven&#039;t seen anything from him featuring the arrest (and, even if I did, I agree with Aronan, how is it not relevant). &nbsp;But I thought the mailings Peralta wouldn&#039;t claim ownership to are the very negative, yet accurate ones being distributed by Fight Back. &nbsp;In other words, I don&#039;t agree that Peralta&#039;s denial of ownership of these pieces is, as has been stated, a &quot;blatant lie&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />

				<em>Daily News: </em> <br /><br />Expelled Sen. Hiram Monserrate boasted in the run-up to Tuesday&#039;s special election that he was operating an all-volunteer, grass-roots campaign.<br /><br />It turns out the grass roots include almost his entire legislative staff, a paid consultant and a nonprofit that got city-funded video equipment from Monserrate, the Daily News found.<br /><br />Records reveal 10 of Monserrate&#039;s 14 staffers and a paid campaign worker collected hundreds of the 3,000 signatures that got him on the ballot.<br /><br />Another signature gatherer was Luis Jimenez, vice president of the nonprofit Latin American Talent Support, who used his Queens public TV show to attack Monserrate&#039;s rival, Jose Peralta.<br /><br />Another signature collector runs a nonprofit group that has received taxpayer money from Monserrate. That harkens back to 2007, when the city Department of Investigation looked into whether workers at another nonprofit called Libre helped get him elected. No charges resulted.<br /><br />This time the nonprofit is called Latin American Talent Support, which lists its address as the basement of the Corona home of Jimenez.<br /><br />Reached by phone, Jimenez said he was the group&#039;s vice president and referred questions to its president, Cesar Camacho, who refused to discuss the issue.<br /><br />Then-City Councilman Monserrate earmarked $5,000 in city funds for the group in 2008.<br /><br />Agency e-mails show the city Department of Youth and Community Development let the group change how the money would be used after a late-2007 call from Monserrate&#039;s office. Under the grant, it was to be used to pay rent for a small office.<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/03/14/2010-03-14_hirams_election_hijinks_uses_former_staffers_to_get_back_on_ballot.html#ixzz0i9hScfuV<br /><br /><br />

His common answer seemed to me to be that government shouldn&#039;t be involved in social programs, there is no money, and he is opposed to Marriage Equality. There were a couple of questions he just didn&#039;t understand, which showed a lack of understanding of the issues to me. His energy and approach to the debate seemed like he really didn&#039;t want to be there. Beltrani is not serious candidate. <br /><br />The republicans know they won&#039;t win this election, they are running someone just to take votes away from Peralta. It behooves them to have Monserrate in the Senate as his presence is&nbsp; a black eye to the Democrtas, and HM&#039;s not likely to go along with the democratic leadership very often which certainly helps the Republican&#039;s cause in the Senate.

He is not up on the issues - he just lives in JH. His performances at IS 145 and on NY1 were unmovtivated and uninspiring. I have voted for many Republicans, including Bloomberg. However, in these cases they were the best candidates in the lot. <br /><br />In this case, Beltrani is just a space filler with a sense that the turn-coast Monserrate is better for the GOP than Peralta. However, the one point that Beltrani made in the NY1 debate that if a person given counselling and community service in lieu of jail doesn&#039;t fulfill the sentence they would probably go to jail (Bertrani is a Parole Judge). <strong>Note that Monserrate has not done his community service or counselling as perscribed by the Jusge at his conviction. Maybe the Rat will go to jail.</strong><br /><br /><strong>STOP MONSERRATE - VOTE PERALTA!</strong>&nbsp; :rockon:

				@ Aronan - I have to agree. &nbsp;He is not a politician (that&#039;s actually a good thing) but he looked almost desolate in some of the interviews I saw. &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure why he is even running. &nbsp;Maybe Beltrani is looking to start a political career and it&#039;s a way for him to get his name out to the masses. &nbsp;He obviously knows the turnout will be dismal and maybe betting on the a split vote on the Democratic side.

				Let&#039;s face it, a politician is nothing to cheer over. Jose is a party man but he is not an abuser. That is a major positive. A really major positive.

				Maybe if Monserrate was in Albany instead of Jackson Heights, he wouldn&#039;t have hurt his girlfriend. by electing him, this will limit the public&#039;s exposure to violence.

				Marlene,<br /><br />You are correct that Peralta mis-spoke about the funding of the campaign literature. It may that he just doesn&#039;t know just what his campaign is funding or mailing out. Maybe he lied. <br /><br />However, that doesn&#039;t add up to the lies, the abuse, the civil rights &nbsp;/ bigotry, the political activities that shut the Senate out, the funds given to a highly questionable (even missing organization) - El Libre that never filed tax reports or anything else, &nbsp;and a personal shadowy past with the police department - including filing for a disability pension on psychological reasons. <em>Moster Rat does not represent this district and cannot be returned to the Senate.</em><br /><br />With that said, who can one vote for? Not the GOP - a nice guy who is well over his head and certainly not a representive of our area. And <em>not voting would add up to a vote for for the Rat.</em> These two options would not be acceptable to most. If the Rat wins by one vote, will it be your vote? Can you accept that horrible out come.<br /><br />Bsically, I could not live with the terrible possiblity that my actions were the reason that that violent abuser and shadowy slime gets back into the Senate as our elected official. That would be the worst case outcome. <strong>HM cannot be returned to Albany. What would he do then - it is unthinkable.</strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"><em><strong>I believe that we must vote for Perlta.

				http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/nyregion/16hiram.html<br /><br /><strong>March 15, 2010<br />Race for Monserrateâ€™s Old Senate Seat Winds Down<br />By FERNANDA SANTOS</strong><br /><br />During a forum in Jackson Heights, Queens, last Thursday, candidates for a vacant State Senate seat were given a chance to question one another. One of them, Hiram Monserrate, addressed his leading opponent, JosÃ© R. Peralta, as â€œJosÃ©.â€ Mr. Peralta addressed him as â€œMr. Monserrate.â€ <br /><br />That formality underscores a change in the relationship between two men who once called each other â€œbrother.â€ That, of course, was before Mr. Monserrateâ€™s expulsion from the State Senate last month, after his conviction of misdemeanor domestic assault. Mr. Peralta and Mr. Monserrate are Latino, like a majority of people in the district. Each has also been the Queens Democratic Partyâ€™s golden child at some point. But these days, that is where their similarities end. <br /><br />In a special election on Tuesday, the choice for some voters will hinge on ideology. Mr. Peralta, a Democrat who represents parts of western Queens in the Assembly, supports same-sex marriage. Mr. Monserrate, who is running as an independent, opposes it. The third candidate is Robert Beltrani, a Republican administrative law judge who has said he does not favor same-sex marriage but would let New Yorkers decide in a referendum. He is considered a long shot. <br /><br />click link for more.

				Beltrani is another liar! He was forced to run by Monserrate&#039;s supporters (his former colleagues) the Republicans to steal votes from Peralta. Monserrate was a registered Republican and switched to the Democratic party for personal gains and not because he represents the best interest of SD#13 constituents. He has always fought against the establishment-he said it himself on the NY1 debate. That means he&#039;s not fit for office. He&#039;s a liar, a thief, a woman abuser and a criminal!<br /><br />Watch the debate at this link: http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/115089/monserrate--queens-rivals-lock-horns-in-ny1-debate

				I really can&#039;t wait for this to be over. I&#039;m pretty optimistic that Jose will win. <br />Funny, I have a knot in my stomach, though, thinking of the impossible happening. I live in JH for the diversity. I live in JH because it is the largest gay population outside of Greenwich Village. It was frightening to me to see all the anti gay sentiment and the language of hatred expressed by the people who are supporting HM. &nbsp;It was unnerving to see Hiram. This....is America?

				Well Finally!!!!! HIT THE ROAD HIRAM, it is despicable that he ran a campaign smearing Peralta and a homophobic&nbsp; campaign of vitriolic slurs.&nbsp; Did anyone see the black &amp; white piece left on windshields.&nbsp; It is amazing that hey had women out on the campaign trail handing out MONSTER RAT leaflets who seemed oblivious to his face slashing , holding up the senate for ransom and&nbsp; getting expelled from the senate,&nbsp; antics.<br /><br />He is really a sorry character, pathetic and delusional.&nbsp; He needs to attack and deny equal rights to the gay community while saying he stands for &quot;the community.&quot; Hello look around this community, diversity is its&#039; middle name. Well I guess&nbsp; HIS&nbsp; community is&nbsp; a good old God fearing, wife beating, face slashing, ego fueled cauldron of hate and corruption......now don&#039;t let him get anywhere in the run for Peralta&#039;s seat because you know he will try. Support Bryan Pu Folkes..... Lets hope Montserrate&nbsp; doesn&#039;t fall and trip while carrying a wine glass and accidentally, oh my God I am sorry, cut someone and try to take them to another hospital outside the district so no one knows it happened....it would be a shame.
