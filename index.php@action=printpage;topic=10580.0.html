				They&#039;ve really created a lovely scene in there. Went for a drink last night with two friends and despite the outside temp of 5 degrees, the place was hopping -- very impressive! And I appreciate the fact that the prices are the same. They must have spent plenty on this very up-to-the-minute interior so I hope the crowds keep coming. Just goes to prove the point made so often on this site: if you bring something more sophisticated to the area, you will find people coming out of the woodwork who don&#039;t necessarily fraternize the other places around here. I like food/drink at all price points but am glad to see something new and sleek but with the same fine food and neighborhood warmth.

				&nbsp; Recently had a fun celebratory dinner there and was very pleased. The food was nicely prepared and &quot;clean&quot; if that<br />is a possible food description in that the flavors seemed distinct. Atmosphere was great with good lighting and ambiance.<br />The only glitch so far is the service could step up a tad. But overall it&#039;s absolutely great to have this type of place in<br />the neighborhood and my crystal ball predicts that they should do very well in this new location. The neighborhood <br />looks to be giving them a big, warm, welcoming hug. <br />&nbsp;Congrats to Arunee for making 37th avenue your new home!

				Had lunch at the new place this weekend, food was just like it was at the old place. They were slammed (at 3pm) with folks coming in right up until 4 (they close between 4 and 5). Thought they did a great job with the interior renovation.

				I went with a friend Sunday night.&nbsp; The place was jammed.&nbsp; As people finished and got up, the tables were taken by new people.&nbsp; For the posts about service:&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they ever expected to be so damn busy.&nbsp; The food took awhile to come but when it did the portions were large and the food was great.&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked our waiter if they were surprised by how busy they were and he said yes, they needed to hire more people in the kitchen.<br /><br />The food was always a big plus to me at the original location so that hadn&#039;t changed. I would say the interior was completely unexpected and I loved it.

				I have been hesitating to post this, since there is so much buzz about the new Arunee and the stories about an immigrant family business. But from all the posts about Trade Fair, it does seem that many people on the list care about how employees of local businesses are treated, so here goes:<br /><br />We made friends with some of the workers at Arunee a few years back; met with them regularly to help them with their English. <br /><br />At some point, one of them came to us needing help figuring out a letter from the IRS. We realized that the owners were forcing them to pay the employer&#039;s portion of the social security tax -- he/she didn&#039;t realize it was illegal.&nbsp; This opened a larger conversation, and to our distress we found out some pretty unpleasant things about how the undocumented workers, in particular, were being exploited and threatened. We really liked the food, so it was hard to stop patronizing them!<br /><br />We didn&#039;t publicize what we knew because the workers asked us not to. However they have long since moved on, so we are doing so now. They weren&#039;t whiners -- we knew them for more than a year before they told us anything.<br /><br />Perhaps, now that the business is under the management of the next generation, and they are trying to change their business model, it&#039;s worth it to have a conversation with the owners and let them know how important these issues are to many who are likely to be their regular customers?

				The truth is that these sort of practices are so commonplace that if you want to boycott, you would have to do so for virtually every restaurant. Delivery people work insane hours, do not get paid wages, and have to pay out a portion of their measly tips to the restaurant. The workers who prepare the food, wash the dishes and bus the tables may be illegal immigrants and purposefully underpaid. It&#039;s the nature of the restaurant business; most people turn a blind eye to it and just want to have a good time.

				I know it&#039;s very typical in Japanese restaurants to close between lunch and dinner to do a thorough cleaning. They do not consider it favorable to clean in front of customers. It also gives the staff a chance to rest, regroup, or change shifts before the next rush. I don&#039;t know if the same goes for Thai places, but it could be.

				I&#039;ve always loved the food at Arunee, but the new location and decor has made me a fan for life.&nbsp; I&#039;m really hoping the other restaurants in the neighborhood will take notice of the crowds at the new Arunee and step it up a notch.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m being optimistic, but I see this as a real turning point for Jackson Heights.

				the new location has a great look and feel. I still think the food is a small cut below Ayada, Chao and Ploy -- no matter how much they claim they don&#039;t tone down flavors, they do so (not just heat, but other strong tones as well) -- but it&#039;s still great to have around. very happy to see that people have responded so well.<br /><br />oh, and as far as delivery? I think they bluff a little bit...about a week ago, we called for delivery and the gentleman who answered the phone said &#039;it will be about an hour...maybe 90 minutes.&#039; we were set on the notion of thai, so I agreed, and he thanked me for understanding...and had an order at our door in 40 minutes tops.

				I&#039;ve been meaning to give Arunee another try based on all of the positive reviews here. I agree that the new interior looks great.<br /><br />The few times I&#039;ve been to Arunee in the past, my experience has been similar to dssjh and toque198&#039;s. <br /><br />For Thai, my favorite place in the neighborhood is Zabb Elee on Broadway. It&#039;s on the same block as UFC. I believe they deliver and I&#039;m sure the wait would not be as long.<br />

				We went to the new Arunee last weekend.We liked the improvements -certainly the old Arunee was cramped and in need of modernizing. This new place is tastefully decorated and feels more like a Manhattan restaurant in some ways. The verdict is still out on how well it will stand up against Sriprapha ,Zabb or Ayada. My last meal at Sri was on a balmy summer night and we ate in the garden. The food was excellent. So for a neighborhood place this is fine and I would certainly go back but I&#039;m not sure how it compares. <br /><br />Decor by the way is no big deal for me . I love Deera which doesn&#039;t take it itself too seriously and serves up massive portions to what appears to be a very savvy clientele.&nbsp;

				Decided to stop in for lunch and try a bento box special.&nbsp; Was happy to see the place was busy even during lunch.&nbsp; They added two more tables near the bar area I&#039;m guessing because they&#039;re doing a brisk business. Interior decor is a huge deal to me only because this neighborhood has some of the most unattractive or bland places to dine in.&nbsp; It&#039;s nice to eat in a restaurant that&#039;s actually attractively designed.&nbsp; But that&#039;s not such a big deal if a place seems clean and the food is good.<br /><br />I have to remember that even if a dish says pad thai vegetables it doesn&#039;t mean animal product won&#039;t be mixed in.&nbsp; My pad thai had eggs which I know is traditional so I wasn&#039;t upset but it made me realize I have to order more carefully if I want vegetarian.&nbsp; <br /><br />RE: davenothere&#039;s post about their business practice of taking advantage of their employees -- honestly I wouldn&#039;t know what to say because (A) for me it&#039;s just hearsay and (B) it doesn&#039;t sound like you did anything back when you were informed.&nbsp; Unless I&#039;m wrong and you spoke to the owner what good would saying something now do when there&#039;s no real proof?&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you did the wrong thing or that you should have done something... but what do you expect customers to say without sounding stupid?&nbsp; &quot;Oh awhile ago someone online became friendly with your employees, who no longer work for you, but those employees said you were dishonest?, unethical? and I wanted to say, please don&#039;t do that&quot;.&nbsp; See what I mean davenothere?&nbsp; What is it you think people can say?

				Great news. Arunee can handle my gluten-free request! I&#039;m going to be ordering from them a LOT.<br /><br />Frankly this just seems to have to do with the fact that front of house is run by a couple of Thai-American twentysomethings with fluent English and a solid grasp on the latest trends. When I asked the lady on the phone about gluten-free, she seemed surprised that I even thought it was weird. BIG WIN.

				We went Arunee Thai on Wednesday at 6:45 PM.&nbsp; The place was not that busy however the service was awful!<br /><br />We were a party of four and the 4th dish, which was a simple curry dish, came 10 minutes after all of the others!<br />They got the salad order wrong and I had to walk up to our waitress to get her attention.&nbsp; The food came mild even thought we had ask for spicy.<br /><br />The problem seems to be that one waitress was on staff for the whole place.&nbsp; She also does not seem to understand english very well and therefore does not understand requests for spicy food or even getting the order right.&nbsp; This still does not explain why you can&#039;t serve the food for the table at one time. :&#039;(<br /><br />It is a shame because the decor and menu is good.&nbsp; I hope the owner reads this and hires more staff.

				Have been wanting to dine in the restaurant, but Arunee has been one of my may deliver at home restaurants in the hood.&nbsp; Since they opened at new location, the home delivery has been fast, the person on the phone more efficient, and the food has been consistently good.&nbsp; I still want to dine in--but glad to see a restaurant with nice decor open on 37th Ave--and as others mentioned--hopefully restauranteurs take notice and open up more diverse restaurants in Jackson Heights.

				Gothamist has a new article on Arunee (http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/still_got_it_arunee_thai.php).&nbsp; I agree with the article-- the new etiquette rules in their menu are obnoxious and off-putting.&nbsp; The higher prices have also reduced the frequency that I&#039;m ordering from here.&nbsp; &nbsp;But the food is still good, and it&#039;s nice to see Arunee attracting attention from outside the neighborhood.

				I read the article. I haven&#039;t been to the new Arunee, but I ate at the old one a few times. I found their food to be good, but the service was &quot;odd.&quot; <br />Examples: <br />We weren&#039;t allowed to bring home leftover food from the lunch special. <br />Another party asked to change tables, and they were told no, even though it was just us &amp; them in the restaurant. <br />I generally found the waitstaff kind of distant and uninterested, but perfectly competent, so it didn&#039;t really bother me. <br /><br />I also think those rules, even if I agree with them, are obnoxious.
