					Never heard of this scam, but there are so many out there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve specifically told my mother that she is never to give any information over the phone and that if she thinks something is legitimate, she should have them call me and I would take care of it.&nbsp; So far, she&#039;s gotten calls from banks seeking to &quot;confirm&quot; her identity, from Social Security asking for her SS #, from the IRS, asking her for payment (and you can pay by credit card - how convenient!), etc.&nbsp; She&#039;s gotten pretty adept at knowing scams, but we should all make sure our parents are well aware to never give ANY information over the phone, ever.

					I&#039;ve only been a casual observer on this topic, but as a lawyer myself, I know that when dealing with the DOB, you don&#039;t do things yourself.&nbsp; You hire people that know the inner workings of the DOB - expediters, engineers, architects, master plumbers and the like.&nbsp; And you do this BEFORE you sign a lease, because they will be able to go into the Building records, look at its history, and let you know immediately what it will take to open a business and to get the proper permits.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seemed to me as a casual observer that Stu wanted to do things himself in the beginning, ran into the typical bureaucracy and instead of looking for immediate help from professionals, started arguments with local officials and government employees.&nbsp; While I am aware that, at times, Court employees can be slow and somewhat short (and sometimes borderline lazy), I would NEVER EVER be anything but incredibly sweet and patient because they control what I need, and sometimes you have to swallow your pride and feelings to get what you want.&nbsp; Stu learned this too late in the game.<br /><br />If he was just served with a Petition, there&#039;s still hope.&nbsp; And I do hope he makes it.&nbsp; But I also hope the next person that tries gets some advice before diving head first.

					&lt;One thing that raises the value of a property is a having a national retailer, like a Duane Reade or a Starbucks or a Chase, as a tenant. So that&#039;s (perhaps/supposedly/apparently) one thing that might explain why properties can actually stay vacant indefinitely, with seeming no motivation to find a renter: landlords are playing a long game, not looking for a monthly check.&gt;<br /><br />Most of the spaces in our neighborhood just aren&#039;t big enough for those type of tenants.&nbsp; I understand that, as a landlord, that&#039;s is your goal, but when you have a small storefront, you have to face reality.

					Taxing someone just because their property is vacant is a horrible idea.&nbsp; I agree that empty stores are an eyesore, especially if the owner is absent and doesn&#039;t take care of the property at all (like the Gothic property - the owner never shoveled and the place was an ice patch), but there are solutions to assure - or to punish - an owner to keep the place clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer in the market.&nbsp; You may be able to keep your store vacant for a year, maybe two, but eventually, you will need income and, with that, you will have to accept a lower rent.&nbsp; I agree that we&#039;re in a transition period for businesses, so maybe landlords know this too and are waiting it out.

					Blast from the past.&nbsp; I was a member of this gym in the 90&#039;s when I lived downtown in the city.&nbsp; They used to have several branches there, but they eventually closed all of them.&nbsp; From what I can remember, membership was cheap, and the equipment was not very well maintained.&nbsp; As a result, once the city started to get better gyms, the chain folded there.&nbsp; Maybe they learned their lesson.

					Greek guy here.&nbsp; We tried this place the first week they were open.&nbsp; There were definitely some glitches (items on the menu weren&#039;t available, and it took a long time for our meal to be served - and I do mean a long time), but nothing that can&#039;t be ironed out over the next few weeks.&nbsp; We were told that many of the items would be in stock in the future, and what we did eat (the gyro platter) was really good.&nbsp; For sure, I&#039;ll be back, although more towards the end of February so that the staff and the back office have the chance to get more familiar with the menu, clientele and demand.<br /><br />And on a side note, really glad to have a new gyro place in the neighborhood.&nbsp; That will cut down on my trips to Astoria when I get the craving (although nothing can beat mom&#039;s food, so for that, I&#039;ll gladly go to Astoria).

					I was lucky enough to grow up in Astoria and then move to Manhattan during my 20&#039;s and early 30&#039;s before coming here.&nbsp; While he certainly CAN live in this neighborhood with that salary, I agree with the two people above that he will better off looking for a shared apartment, either in Astoria, which has tons of places for younger adults to hang out in, or in Manhattan, which will be more expensive, but would do wonders for his personal life.&nbsp; Compared to these two options, we&#039;re a quiet neighborhood.<br /><br />My 2 cents.

					I&#039;m guessing that this isn&#039;t as much of an issue anymore.&nbsp; I still know that Verizon has pretty bad reception in our building, and AT&amp;T is bad, but at least it&#039;s better than Verizon, but the reason why this matters much less is because of wifi calling.<br /><br />If you have a smartphone, the chances are that one of the options the phone gives you is to transmit your cell phone call through your home wifi when the cellular signal is less than optimal.&nbsp; The phone is then supposed to switch back and forth, if needed, so that your call does not disconnect.<br /><br />This has certainly solved any issues I had with AT&amp;T.&nbsp; I enter my apartment and put my phone in a location where it switches to wifi calling.&nbsp; I have not had an issue since that time.
