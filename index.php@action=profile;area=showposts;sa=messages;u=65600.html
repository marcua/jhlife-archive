					Hello!<br />Is this the same farm that delivers raw milk (on the dl) to locations in Queens? I think it&#039;s called Pleasant Pastures. If so, I&#039;d love to join you in ordering and would also know some others who would be interested.&nbsp; <br />Thanks for starting this conversation!

					Hello JH neighbors!<br />I&#039;d like to properly introduce myself and the work that I do!<br />My name is Kim Joseph, and I have a small (steadily growing) baking business in JH called Little Wildbranch Bakery. I specialize in sourdough bread, and I also bake cookies, cakes, bars and those are sometimes sourdough too! I&#039;m also teaching monthly workshops on Intro to Sourdough Baking!<br />My bread leans heavily on whole grains, which helps to achieve that intense sour flavor that many folks love!<br />Every week I bake two types of sourdough bread: one is a plain multigrain and the other is baker&#039;s choice. Baker&#039;s choice is dependent upon my infinite list of recipes that I desire to bake, inspiration, seasonal ingredients and allows me to be creative with my bakes. <br />The multigrain is about 60-65% whole grains, which includes whole wheat, spelt, barley, einkorn, buckwheat and the remainder is bread flour.&nbsp; I choose to serve multigrain because its better to eat a diverse variety of grains because more grains feed more micro flora in our gut, and as well are high in nutrients and minerals. I want that for myself, so I want that for you! My intent is to create the most nourishing, healthy and delicious bread possible!<br /><br />Healthy? Bread? YES! Sourdough is easier to digest because it is made with wild yeast, so this means that the sourdough starter/levain/wild yeast has live good for you bacteria in it! (similar to yogurt) During the process of fermentation, the wild yeast breaks down/&quot;eats&quot; some of the gluten, so when you eat the bread some of the work has already been done!This makes digestion easier. It is not gluten free! I do have regular customers who haven&#039;t eaten bread in 10 years and joyously eat my bread without any digestive difficulties. Actually, I have difficulty digesting wheat, which is why I began baking sourdough!<br /><br />I rent space at The Queensboro to do my production! So cool, right?! The Queensboro is teaching me what community really feels like. Their generosity and kindness is humbling, and I couldn&#039;t be more pleased to be a part of their space.<br />I use the prep space when the restaurant opens for dinner service, and I bake the bread in the pizza oven after the kitchen closes. <br /><br />You can find me at The Queensboro restaurant selling bread on Thursday evenings from 5-8 pm. I always make extra loaves, but they go quickly! It&#039;s best to pre-order your loaf to guarantee that you will receive it. You can do that my texting me at 347 553-7708, email me at <a href="mailto:littlewildbranchbakery@gmail.com" class="bbc_email">littlewildbranchbakery@gmail.com</a> or message me on IG or Fb. <br />I am increasing my production as I can, and will continue to do so as needed. Once Farmspot CSA begins in June, you can find me there with bread and sweet treats on Thursday evenings at St. Marks church on 82nd and 34th ave from 530-815 pm.<br />The best way to stay up to date is to follow me on Instagram (Little Wildbranch Bakery) and Fb. <br /><br />I am delighted, humbled and so grateful to be able to provide this beautiful bread to you and your families! I&#039;m looking forward to meeting and getting to know you and bake the world a better place!<br /><br />more questions? <a href="http://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.littlewildbranchbakery.com</a> <br /><br />Warmly,<br />Kim Joseph

These are GIANT loaves.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kim&#039;s prices are more than fair for the quality and consistency of the loaves, the inventiveness of her flavors, and the knowledge that your bread is literally made in situ in a wood-fired oven.&nbsp; Order a small loaf, and see if you won&#039;t be salivating as you wait for the next e-mail alerting you to the coming week&#039;s offerings.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Also, my multigrain sourdough is on the brunch menu at The Queensboro as the avocado toast if you&#039;d like to try that!<br />The prices range from $6.50-$16, so there is a wide range. I&#039;m sourcing high quality ingredients that are organic and local when available and always unbleached and non gmo. <br />The large loaf ($16) is ginormous, so I realize that it is pricey, but it&#039;s a lot of bread. Will feed a family of 3 for 2 weeks. <br />I&#039;m here is you ever have any questions! <br />

Thank you so much!<br />Hello! Kim Joseph here! Little Wildbranch Bakery!<br />If anyone is looking for fresh sourdough bread, I&#039;m your bread woman! My bread keeps incredibly well for 7 days, as any true sourdough should!<br />Every week I bake 2 types of bread- plain multigrain and baker&#039;s choice (flavors according to whats in season and where my creativity takes me). I tend to lean more towards ancient grains and whole grains, so here is where you will find nourishing hearty whole grain crusty loaves, all baked after hours in the pizza oven at The Queensboro! <br />I am at the Queensboro on Thursday evenings from 5-8 pm for bread pick ups. Most of the bread is by order to avoid waste, but I do try to bake extras, which go quickly. <br />I take orders weekly until 5 pm on Tuesdays, because that is when I make the dough. <br />You can find my weekly bread and most up to date info on Instagram and Fb, and of course my website at <a href="https://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.littlewildbranchbakery.com/</a><br />You may also text me your orders at 347 553-7708<br />Wishing everyone a lovely weekend.<br />Warmly, <br />Kim Joseph
