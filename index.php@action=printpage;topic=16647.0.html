				Several on 37th avenue...maybe not so quiet though.&nbsp; The corner space on 78 and 37th where the old Ingrid&#039;s haircutting salon use to be (next to Starbucks).&nbsp; Also the corner of 86th street and 37th where the old Ho&#039;s florist use to be.&nbsp; There are additional vacancies on 37 Avenue, I just don&#039;t remember the exact streets&nbsp; off hand...where Gothic furniture about 84 and 37th Avenue&nbsp;

I would estimate that space at under 300 square feet on the ground floor level. There might be more square footage downstairs in the basement, but I am not sure having the space split between two floors would work for a fitness business. It would be fantastic to see a movement studio in the old Gothic furniture space on the corner of 37th and 83rd St. I kind of suspect they are asking for way too much rent, though, since it&#039;s been empty for a few years.<br /><br />Have you checked Loopnet? http://www.loopnet.com/New-York/Jackson-Heights-Commercial-Real-Estate/

				I did notice a space on the same floor as Blink Gym is available.&nbsp; Not sure how loud it is since the block is adjacent to Roosevelt, might be ok since the building is big and office might be deeper into the building.&nbsp; Might make sense to be close to the one other major gym facility considering Blink doesn&#039;t offer classes like yours and it might be good to have fitness-interested traffic near your front door...&nbsp; I was just looking for space for my business too, and find that location interesting but I don&#039;t need so much space.<br /><br />I might be a customer as the lack of yoga options in the neighborhood that fit my schedule often leaves me doing yoga by myself at Blink :)
