				As I told my kids recently, in the days before iPhones we did not record every moment of our lives. Cameras came out on special occasions -- birthdays, weddings...&nbsp; As a teenager with a decent camera I never felt the urge to photograph the stores on Roosevelt or 37th because I just assumed they&#039;d be there forever.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp; I rode to the 78th Street Park (now called Travers) and the place was unrecognizable to me. I think only the handball courts and baseball backstop remain unchanged from 50 years ago. I wish I would have taken some shots of the park back then.&nbsp; With that said I will look through my boxes and see if anything turns up.&nbsp;

				I grew up in the area in the 60&#039;s--born in 1955. Graduated from PS 69 and 145. Don&#039;t remember any lumberjack families.&nbsp; Then again my parents didn&#039;t name me Queenskid2. What schools did you go to?&nbsp; <br />

She was on the Altar Guild at St. Marks Episcopal Church (Protestants were a minority in the Heights except for a small square of garden apartments between 75th and 82nd streets, north of 37th avenue and south of Northern Blvd.)
