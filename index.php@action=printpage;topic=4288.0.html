				Can anyone tell me anything about the Graystone buildings (80th Street between 37th and 35th)? I am thinking about looking at an apartment in one of them and want to know if there is any information you guys can tell me that a real estate agent won&#039;t. Also - how is that section of Jackson Heights in terms of crime, community problems, etc. Any info would be great.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I lived in one (35-16) for 9 years.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice small board, where everyone is a director, but there&#039;s also some negative to that in that EVERYONE is a director, if you catch my meaning.&nbsp; As in you take turns being Secretary, Treasurer, et al.<br /><br />The building I had was very nice.&nbsp; Granted I lived on the first floor, right off the staircase, so the &#039;wlak up&#039; aspect was not as much as factor for me as some.<br /><br />The only shame is the lack of a usable backyard area.

				We live on the west side of the street.&nbsp; Some buildings have two apt&#039;s per floor, others have three.&nbsp; We are also self-managed so we don&#039;t use a managing agent.&nbsp; This is true co-op living, you will know your neighbors.&nbsp; Luckily for us we love them -but the meetings can be a little difficult sometimes.&nbsp; The buildings are very solid, I don&#039;t hear my neighbors, and the back garden is very quiet.&nbsp; My Greystone building has a full time super and each night she collects trash via the dumb-waiter -very old-fashioned and convenient.&nbsp; -It is truly one of the most beautiful blocks in NYC.&nbsp; -As for the garden, I use it, and nobody has said anything.&nbsp; I even went so far as to install a lovely wooden bench -and I&#039;m hoping it inspires more garden usage.&nbsp;

				NO, BBQ&#039;s are not permitted.&nbsp; Radio&#039;s are not permitted.&nbsp; No Ball playing, -there are a lot of restrictions.&nbsp; But, you can bring out a lawn chair, or have a picnic, and it&#039;s very cool and tranquil in the summertime...&nbsp; &nbsp;
