					Thanks.. <br />Do they not put pieces up online? I cannot find anything but the piece shot last night, which seems really hacked together and incomplete. And, look, I know I&#039;ve been busy, but what&#039;s the story here? I feel like I stepped out to the loo and came back into some scene from a later Luis BuÃ±uel film. <br />Did anyone get a full recording of the town hall? <br /><br />I saw someone at the rally but never saw the piece. I don&#039;t know how that works at NY1, but it seems to be it could be a lot easier. <br /><br />For those who missed it, I recorded audio of the rally and put it to a cheezy slideshow. &nbsp;If you are interested in doing audio or video of future events, and/or are interested in writing about events, descriptions, summaries, etc. of what&#039;s happening, please let me know. Here is the link to the rally: <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2948803" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://blip.tv/file/2948803</a> (note that the first minute and some is black screen with sound. &nbsp;then the slideshow starts. &nbsp;accidental artsy effect, i&#039;m so sorry, i&#039;m not a skilled slideshower<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth, and you&#039;ll see for yourself, the article/revelations/accusations/whathaveyou, come at a bad time. Mr. Peralta is riding a wave of community support that seems to be building up steam. The rally for marriage equality, led by Danny Dromm, seemed a Peralta moment. I thought they were passionate speakers, but for insight into Jose&#039;s character, I really appreciated the way he handled the man who got very loud and angry. Only feet away, it wasn&#039;t clear that this person was, in fact, feeling the passion of the moment and he seemed (to me at least) as almost menacing, threatening, heckling. I&#039;m not sure that this man was intending to come off that way, but he certainly did as you will hear in the recording. I learned something very valuable about Jose Peralta by the way he handled the situation, seemingly diffusing it by acknowledging the question (which had to do with whether or not Jose would turn his back on th LGBT community, and thus a vote for marriage equality in the NYS Senate) and then responding in the only way he really can answer, moving it back to the forward progress of a political speech (as opposed to succombing to the rhetorical devolutions of such of the heckler). His answer was not as valuable for me as the way he seemed to redirect the man&#039;s anger into something else... Anyhow, you&#039;ll hear it for yourself and tell me if I&#039;m wrong. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

					December 4, 2009, Jackson Heights, New york: <br /><br />In an exciting turn of events, a bizarre giant invasive species of enormous plastic flowers has landed in Jackson Heights, a district with a unique history of promoting vibrant primary colors, creative use of petroleum-based public sculpture, and an emphasis on flash and wit over the cool and downbeat. These flowers have appeared in the courtyard behind the Community Methodist Church at 81st and 35th Ave and are available for public viewing 24/7. <br /><br />Here is a picture:<br /><br /><img src="http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3655/alienflowers.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" />

					Regardless of the veracity of the particular claims of news outlets such as ABC et al., it&#039;s important to remember how WMD was all over the news in 2002, while only the Washington Post and a few other papers reported that Rumsfeld and friends were screening movies in the Pentagon, such as the <span class="bbc_u">Battle of Algiers</span>, as part of their war planning.

					I have some essentially new clothes that don&#039;t fit me and want to donate them to either a local charity organization or a second hand retailer worthy of support.

					Thanks for posting this article. I know that the handwringing over immigration and real estate has been going on in Jackson Heights since the beginning, but I would be interested to read print articles about this from bygone eras, especially from independent or otherwise &quot;undergound&quot; publications. Is there a historian of Jackson Heights print culture around? I know often the best sources for information on this are community members who&#039;ve been around for a while...<br /><br />I must confess to being shocked that Google is scanning even old magazines. <br /><br />The opt-out settlement seems like a gross injustice to me. I think it is unreasonable to assume that all orphan texts want to be reborn in the 21st Century eternally searchable. When they&#039;re able to find and reproduce underground zines from the neighborhood, I&#039;ll be giving them a pass. Until then, it just grates on me that only one of the largest and richest corporations with tacky slogans like &quot;Don&#039;t be evil&quot; gets an exemption from the U.S. Code. <br /><br />

					I&#039;m sad those amendments were &quot;overwhelmingly approved&quot; -- now many &quot;non-profits&quot; will suddenly spring up looking for free prison labor.<br /><br />I am also sad that Mr. Rahman got even 24% of the vote. It seems this was as much an advertising blitz for a legal practice as anything else. (I&#039;m assuming that people like that are only tireless advocates when it&#039;s billable.) <br /><br />For me, the awful feeling I got in my stomach when I read about his &quot;strategy&quot; of smear and deception is still there.&nbsp; It would be really great if some follow-up on the institutionalization of homophobic campaign rhetoric in the 25th (and the city more broadly) -- that&#039;s what the &quot;Sears playbook&quot; (and Sears) will be remembered for. It would really be great to snuff out those torches before that malicious flame metastasizes any further.<br /><br />Does anyone know of any writers currently working on something like this? Follow-ups with the principals would have to be a part of any investigative/analytical reporting work.<br /><br />It seems it behooves us as a community to make sure we don&#039;t have to suffer through a replay of this when Mr. Dromm is facing re-election. <br /><br /><br />

					Early mornings I&#039;ve seen people doing Tai Chi in the park in Elmhurst, I think it&#039;s called the Clement Moore Homestead Park.&nbsp; You&#039;ll find the park on Broadway between Britton and Elmhurst Ave. - by the subway entrance to R/V/G <br /><br />

					This seems like the consensus choice. It&#039;s been very heartening to see the many statements calling for Monserrate to resign, and the Queens County organization getting behind Peralta early seems like some enormous pressure in that direction. However, Mr. Monserrate can do enormous damage in the time he has left. He&#039;s shown that he&#039;s only interested in himself and is willing to evacuate principles, party loyalty, the good of his constituents and that of the state generally. Long before the gang of four and the summer coup antics, I was shocked to watch him throw Willets Point under the bus a year ago and then had the gall to show up less than a month or two later to &quot;support them&quot; with Councilmember Ferreras, who by then had replaced him. While others could have seen that coming, for me it was evidence of what a phony he is. And it&#039;s communities such as those most impacted by the changes at WP that are considered his strongest backers? Hopefully, they will find what they need in Peralta. I&#039;m pretty confident they will. <br /><br />I&#039;ve found Assemblymember Peralta to be responsible, intelligent and thoughtful. I noticed that he turns up everywhere, and you don&#039;t have to step onto 37th Ave for very long to see him on the street. He&#039;s always friendly and engaging. Unlike other (outgoing) elected officials, he and those in his office have been friendly and responsive to my queries.&nbsp; I for one will be doing what I can to see this through to the end.<br /><br />Now, what about a replacement for Mr. Peralta? <br /><br />First things first, I know, but doesn&#039;t he have to relinquish his seat in order to run for state senate? Seems like the Queens County organization will have some ideas about this, so shouldn&#039;t we?<br /><br />Seems like this is all part of a larger piece that should be thought-through, especially by those who will be doing street-level campaign work, as I will be.<br /><br />What do you think? <br />&nbsp;

					The question is, perhaps, not so much who will run against him, but who will continue to back him now that he&#039;s been spared automatic ejection via felony? I for one will be keeping a scorecard of Queens County Democrats who a) line up behind him, or b) remain silent.&nbsp; Hopefully, none of our other elected officials will be hiding in the bushes until the anger subsides.&nbsp; I know the Albany folks need him--but we don&#039;t have to play along with that. I know I&#039;ll be backing the Republican if that&#039;s the only opposition to Monserrate next time around.<br /><br />
