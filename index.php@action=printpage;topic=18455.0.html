				<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Aaron Yoon is a technology consultant who has helped businesses ranging from medical centers to beauty supply wholesalers optimize workflow and productivity management. For the past 4 years, he has been working with a New York City hedge fund (unnamed for confidentiality) improving their interdepartmental project logistics, implementing new policies and procedures, effectively raising team performance levels. Currently he focuses on helping middle-class income earners retire faster and richer utilizing financial technology (FinTech). </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m comfortable with the above. People don&#039;t usually do free workshops without there being some kind of benefit to them. I&#039;m cool with the idea of a group organizing free speakers to their members to provide some skills and tool to help with retirement with the idea the speaker could be doing it get qualified leads for his business aimed at middle class income earners, sell a book, a workshop etc. Certainly middle class people aren&#039;t investors in hedge funds. Additionally, it provides a networking opportunity for the group members, so it seems pretty win-win.

Aaron is a member. Attendance is completely optional - if anyone thinks it sounds like a sales presentation, they don&#039;t have to attend.
