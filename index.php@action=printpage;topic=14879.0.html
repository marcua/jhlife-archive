				We are moving, as middle school and high school approach we have decided too much is left to chance here. After 10 years in Jackson Heights we are moving next month to a state where we can actually afford to buy a house and a better lifestyle.&nbsp; We will miss our friends, but my best friends have all moved for the same reasons.&nbsp;

				&nbsp;Moving is so tricky for kids. It can be great for some and if the family has established connections, chances are better is will<br />not be too scary. But lot&#039;s of kids are thrown by having to adapt especially in the middle years. If you have a lot of kids that <br />tends to be a buffer but most people have 1-2, maybe 3 kids here, not exactly a tribe. Also the desire for independence in the<br />teen years is compatible with NYC mass transit easy options. Friends who have to drive their suburban kids all over <br />creation loathe it. Waiting for your teen driver to get home on dark roads make some of the hassles of family/city life look like a fairy<br />picnic in comparison. <br />&nbsp;We came back for the freedom of choice here with schools and extracurricular activities with were not compatible with our families interests.

I grew up in NYC, and I see that at the middle and high school levels, there are a ton of options - more than in most other places. You have to work to access them, but we&#039;re willing to do the work because of the magic that comes from growing up in New York: the freedom to wander the city as a teenager, the access to global people and global resources, the feeling of endless possibility. The only thing that would drive us out would be the need for a larger apartment, but hopefully we can sty where we are.

				My family rents and much as I&#039;d love to stay in the neighborhood, we&#039;ll probably move in a few years once we&#039;re ready to buy our own place. Just don&#039;t see many 3BR/2BA options left for under $400K, and that&#039;s what we&#039;d want to be comfortable. <br />The problem is, haven&#039;t yet found an affordable place with that neighborly JH vibe. Last time we went to an open house in Nassau County, my son looked up and down the street and said &quot;why isn&#039;t anyone out?&quot; I do think the demand for more walkable, transit-rich neighborhoods will eventually drive new developments, but it&#039;s probably not going to happen until my kids are grown.

				I should add that even if apartments were more affordable, I would still think seriously about leaving Jackson Heights because of three factors: the danger posed by traffic, lack of outdoor space, and uneven quality of schools. We have amazing citizens working hard to fix all three of these problems. Part of the problem of rapidly rising rents is that it makes people uncertain how long they can afford to stay in a place, which in turn dampens the drive to really invest in making that place better.
