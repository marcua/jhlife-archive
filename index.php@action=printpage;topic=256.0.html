				Does anyone have any comments to share on the clothing store that&#039;s located approximately 1/2 block up from the post office on the south side of 37th Avenue?&nbsp; It&#039;s the shop that has two wildly endowed female mannequins in their display window.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; This has got to be one of the most shameless and ridiculous displays that I&#039;ve seen on 37th Avenue in the past few years.&nbsp; How does a place like this stay in business?&nbsp; In my opinion, it&#039;s an embarrassment to the community, it&#039;s always empty when I walk by, and my question is....how can they afford the rent on a decently sized locale when real estate rumors claim incredibly high rents on the avenue?&nbsp; Whenever I walk by this place and happen to be accompanied by friends from out of town, they always seem to enjoy a good chuckle when they spot it...particularly the guys.&nbsp; This shop is a sad joke.&nbsp;

				Yes, the mannequins have large breasts. So what? Should they all be cookie-cutter types ? What&#039;s wrong with large breasts? Do you laugh at women with large breasts? I can see your friends have a sense of humor. Lighten up, buddy. You need to get used to it. I&#039;m wondering if you examine the crotches of male mannequins to see that it passes the socially acceptable &quot;bulge&quot; which must be approved by the community! Do you approve of the hair length of the mannequins? If you are offended by plastic, you&#039;re ill!

				come on, now - offended is one thing, yeah, but these mannequins are beyond ridiculous and are meant to be titillating (pardon the pun) in their bazoomness, rather than reflective of any real female bodies.&nbsp; They are meant to look like surgically enhanced &#039;glamour models.&#039;<br /><br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t know anyone who has looked at these and not had some reaction to them.

				Who is not well here?&nbsp; Do you usually go around making bold statements that people are &quot;ill&quot; when you don&#039;t even know them?<br /><br />When my friends laugh at these mannequins, it&#039;s not exactly a moment to be proud of.&nbsp; They&#039;re laughing at the store manager, basically ridiculing him/her/them on the&nbsp; poor taste of the display.&nbsp; The comments I have gotten, and I tend to agree with, are that these displays are tacky and send the WRONG message to young and impressionable women.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame that these types of stores target insecure woman who feel that they are more attractive when they dress in such fashion.&nbsp; This is downright ignorant, as is your comment that I should &quot;just get used to it.&quot;&nbsp;

				Yeah. It&#039;s pretty ridiculous. They&#039;re obviously there as a sort of novelty or attention getter. Personally, I think it makes the store<br />look trashy. The same store has a poster/display outside of a woman in some sexy lingerie.<br />But you&#039;ll notice, unlike most other lingerie ads, her legs are spread wide open &quot;smut magazine&quot; style,&nbsp; and the focus is on her crotch.<br />Real classy.

				By the looks of this thread they get a lot of commenting. The first time I saw it/them, I was a bit taken aback, because it/they looked like&nbsp; surgically inhanced porn stars/models.&nbsp; &nbsp;The breasts are quite unbalanced, considering the bodies are thin.&nbsp; They kind of make Pamela Anderson look natural.&nbsp; And they may be somewhat reflective of the whole plastic surgury obsession. I wonder if most men like this kind of look? My other curiousity is, if they actually do good business.

				I can&#039;t speak for all men- but unnaturally sized parts of anyone&#039;s anatomy is naturally going to be un-attractive.<br />And this I know for sure: Women are far more obsessed with the size of their breasts than men are.<br /><br /><br />

				Let&#039;s spin this thread from the opposite end:<br /><br />What if the male mannequins in the same window were sporting huge, obvious, oversized bulges in their pants?&nbsp; Come on, it would look obscene.&nbsp; There would be a furor in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Yet, few seem all that squeamish to see ridiculously objectified women portrayed in such a manner.<br /><br />New to the neighborhood myself, I was pretty appalled to see The Mannequins Of Oversized Mammary Glands.

				I actually went in the store and spoke with the owners. Took a lot of chutzpah. I basically asked the reason for those mannequins. He replied that it was to show women with different sizes. It seems he realizes that those mannequins are porn-ish. He also stated they plan to move their shop to 82nd st, and it&#039;s some kind of wholesale business. He stated he might tone down the display.

				Kate, I commend you on the action you took.&nbsp; A few years back, my husband and I did something similar at one of the shops on 82nd Street.&nbsp; The manager at that time seemed a bit embarrassed, but overall said that this is how woman like to dress in his country and that the men can better visualize their women by admiring the mannequins.&nbsp; By the way, our willingness to ask about that particular display was prompted by the reaction of an elderly woman as she stood in front of the shop looking appalled.

				When I went into the store, I suggested that the owner perhaps put more conservative clothing, like a jogging suit,&nbsp; on the &quot;well-endowed&quot; mannequins. I think the skimpy clothing may add to the tackiness. This way he can still use them, but, it might give the overall look a bit more &quot;acceptable&quot; to the &quot;diversity&quot; of the neighborhood. The man gave me his card after I offered to help with some ideas on his new store. Since I have a knack for art and design,&nbsp; I figured i might be somewhat helpful. Per his card, I think they wholesale perfumes, etc.

				It will be interesting to see what moves into this space, now that the well-endowed mannequins have moved on to entertain/offend the masses on 82nd Street.<br /><br />In the five years I&#039;ve lived here, nothing has stayed in business here for very long.&nbsp; Before the clothing store, there were several bad fast food restaurants in quick succession, each apparently independently owned but resembling chain stores in quality and ambiance -- a Subway knock-off, a burrito place, a pseudo-Columbian place, etc.&nbsp; Before that, and before my time, I think this was the location of Cafe Greco, which sounds like it was a great community gathering spot in its day.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s a challenging location for any kind of retail operation, because the neighboring businesses (which are firmly ensconced) are closed much of the time, creating an &quot;unfriendly&quot; consumer environment. Such considerations are crucial in assessing whether a retail start-up will survive.&nbsp;

				On a related note, the Columbian Glamour store across from the Health Food Store near 83rd is now sporting a huge poster on the door advertising &quot;Anorexy Jeans&quot;.&nbsp; Apparently they are a Columbian brand and there was already some controversy surrounding the brand name.&nbsp; I found this on a blog:<br /><br /><strong>Brings New Meaning to the term &quot;Skinny Jeans&quot;</strong><br />&nbsp;First featured by the tabloid television show Al Rojo Vivo, a line of jeans in MedellÃ­n, Colombia is causing controversy. The jeans are called Anorexy jeans and 15 year old Anorexia survivor Catalina Puerta began a protest against the creators of the line claiming they make the eating disorder that claims at least 17 percent of young women in MedellÃ­n seem fashionable. The first lady of MedellÃ­n, Lucrecia RamÃ­rez, has stepped forward calling for the name of the jeans to be changed. Originally the owner of the Anorexy line, Carlos Mario Zuluaga, at first said that he would not change the name of the line saying he chose the name not because of the eating disorder but because the name sounded good to him and said the jeans were made for all women sized 6-14. The company has since changed its position and the company will likely change its name. <br /><br />http://vivirlatino.com/2005/12/30/brings-new-meaning-to-the-term-skinny-jeans.php<br /><br />

				From the looks of it, the JH &quot;busty&quot; mannequins would fit in quite nicely posing for American Apparel on the Lower East Side.<br /><br />http://racked.com/archives/2008/01/10/american_apparel_getting_cheek.php

				Love this thread. But for those of you tired of the busty female mannequins take a walk to Northern and 80th and check out the crotches on the male mannequins in the window of Pilatos....always a hoot!

				I&#039;ve noticed these mannequins, too! I know that the salespeople/shop owner have seen me gawking at them in disbelief!<br /><br />It&#039;s one thing to be busty or large chested...but being cartoonishly top heavy like the mannequins are is something else altogether.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;ll be sad to see them go. ;D
