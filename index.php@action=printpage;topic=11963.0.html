				We are having a small family gathering (about 25 or so) and are looking for Italian, parking, preferably queens or not too far out in LI. We&#039;ve been to all the ones in Astoria, forest Hills and corona but really need parking for our guests. Any recommendations? thanks!

				Yes, Piccolo does have valet--though possibly just on Fri/Sat/Sun? Probably worth checking if/when making the reservation. <br /><br />If I recall, Manetta&#039;s (in LIC) has ample street parking nearby and is good for groups.

				Our family rarely goes out for Italian, because that&#039;s what we cook at home, but we have went to L&#039;Incontro in Astoria.&nbsp; Pricey, but excellent.&nbsp; We went as a group of 14 (not like 25, but in the same ballpark) and they handled it well.&nbsp; They do have valet parking as well.&nbsp;

				Porto Bella over in Astoria on Ditmas has FREE parking above and below ground.&nbsp; The below ground always has plenty of space.&nbsp; Porto Bella is my friends &#039;go-to&#039; Mom &amp; Pop style Italian restaurant/pizza place.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been going there for years.&nbsp; They have a separate party room attached to the restaurant.&nbsp; I like the food, look of the place (low-key but nicely done) and the people.<br /><br />Definitely my favorite pizza in Queens but also their entrees are really good.&nbsp; My faves: eggplant parm. dinner, Manicotti, spaghetti and meatballs (when I used to eat meat) ... great salads.&nbsp; Go check them out.&nbsp; I copied their link cause it has the party room. But the place is large enough that I would bet you could reserve space inside for 25 people!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know that for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m just an Italian Amer. gal who loves pizza, pasta and wine.<br />http://www.portobellopizzeria.com

				<strong><em>Bella...go to the Pine at the Holiday Inn...ask for Chuck (working partner / married to the sister of the Bronx Pine restaurant people..blah blah blah...LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, you tell him what you want and you tell him that you want authentic Italian family style.&nbsp; <br /><br />The reason I say this is that you will have a lot of fun there.&nbsp; The food can be hit or miss...BUT if you have a &quot;cosa Familia&quot; he will put his best foot forward.&nbsp; Free Parking, Hotel Lobby, BEST View to Citifield and most awesome Square Sports Bar in the area.<br /><br />Listen, I do several family things yearly in Queens, Scarsdale, The Bronx....<br /><br />Dollar for Dollar - Specially if you are a Mets fan - This is it.&nbsp; Italian food cooked by your grandma or Aunt will never be duplicated...but these guys can make it so you and your familia have some pazzo fun and Rilassati while eating some above average Italian fair.<br />&nbsp;<br />Tell Chuck that Luis Martinez (Lukas dad - he may remember my son more than me...OY!)&nbsp; sent you and he might give you free water...LOL/// :D :D :D<br /><br /><br />Just have fun with your loved ones...Life is so very short!!</em><br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(<br /></strong>

				Thanks for all of your responses. Just realized I spelled restaurant wrong :-[&nbsp; We did book a place but I totally forgot about the pine. I remember you mentioning it before. We definitely have to try it out.&nbsp; Buddy Porta Bella was closed for a&nbsp; movie shooting so we didn&#039;t even check that out but will also.
