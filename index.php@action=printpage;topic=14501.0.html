				Title: <strong>Several cars damaged on 79th Street</strong><br />

				I woke up around 3am to the thud of a car crash on 79th street. Ran to the window, a silver minivan had hit one car. While attempting to leave the scene, it backed up and hit two more cars parked on the opposite side of the street. The driver was trying to flee the scene, but the minivan seemed unable to take orders (or he was unable to control the car...).&nbsp; <br /><br />This is when it got interesting. Three men, two women and small girl, around 3 years old, exited the car. Then, the men kept trying to make the minivan move. <br /><br />We called 911 and we saw drivers on the street calling them too. Firemen arrived and talked to the guys. Minutes later, they left.<br /><br />The men eventually moved the minivan further down 79th street, and stopped. Then an ambulance came. But, twenty minutes after we called 911, no sign of police. I went back to bed.<br /><br />If you are one of the owners of the damaged cars and you need to know what happened, I have some pictures for you.<br /><br />
