					The Illy brand coffee at Lemon Farms comes as whole beans and it is very good. I would avoid the bins of beans they also sell there--because who knows how fresh those would be. At times Lemon Farms has also carried a brand that I think is called Joe&#039;s, which is also good. E77 has great beans as well. And of course you can always order beans from various places as well. We found a brand we like called Saccuzzo--a roaster in Connecticut. We drank their coffee at a restaurant in Connecticut, and inquired where it was from. We order from them and also buy from E77 and Lemon Farm. Like them all.

					Not only is it disappointing that the place is gone, it&#039;s disappointing that there was no honest communication about it. It was so popular with so many in the neighborhood, you would think the owner would at least post a notice saying thanks to all my loyal customers, it&#039;s been a pleasure serving you, but unfortunately we will be closing this location--the type of thing I&#039;ve seen many businesses of various kinds do.&nbsp; Instead, they ghosted us!

					It&#039;s true that no-contact delivery is the big advantage of Seamless and the other services. Some places have tried to set up their own systems, but sometimes those systems just don&#039;t work well. Had that experience I with Romeo&#039;s--I tried to use their onlinw ordering/delivery service that was listed on their website, but it simply didn&#039;t work, and I wound up calling and ordering by phone and then picking the food up. The incentive to use a Seamless type of service is strong in this situation--it&#039;s so much easier and safer. I think Ricky&#039;s has their own app for ordering, and I think that one works well. Not sure about others.

					I wouldn&#039;t call this speculation &quot;sniping.&quot; I liked the place very much and used to order delivery from them quite often. I had nothing negative to say about the place. But now, I do think that if they are really renovating they should let customers know what is going on. That&#039;s simply good business--you know, to acknowledge that their clientele might be disappointed that they are closed, and might appreciate knowing what is happening there and whether and when they will come back. I consider that a legitimate criticism, not &quot;sniping.&quot; Calling it &quot;sniping&quot; is...well, sniping.

					I agree that the story about kitchen renovation sounds like a cover story. Normally if a place is being renovated, they paper over the storefront and post a sign that says when the place will reopen--you know, communicate with their loyal customers. Now, they have emptied the place out and are using it for storage for the market next door without bothering to hide that fact. Are they perhaps planning to expand the market into that space? I heard the owner of Farine&#039;s is part owner of the grocery store. Really too bad--it was an amazing place with the quality of the food and the fact that it attracted a cross section of the neighborhood--it was so popular and always buzzing. Ironically, I remember feeling sorry for poor Romeo&#039;s across the street, which was always pretty empty while Farine&#039;s was bustling with customers. Now Romeo&#039;s seems to be doing quite well with takeout, delivery, and outdoor dining, and Farine&#039;s is gone.

					Seems very strange--the &quot;undergoing renovation&quot; thing is often untrue. And if that is really what is happening, why wouldn&#039;t they post a sign or put something on social media to let customers know they will reopen?

					Grub Hub says it is &quot;closed.&quot; Sigh. I was just remarking how amazing it is that it seems like most of our restaurants are still going after all of this. I took a walk up 37th a few weeks ago and only saw one place that was permanently closed. So many outdoor cafes--and far fewer places that have closed compared with what you see in Manhattan now. Farine&#039;s was doing so well before this, it seemed. Always crowded. This is very sad. But not surprising--more surprising is that most seem to be hanging on.

					Well it&#039;s different strokes for different folks, isn&#039;t it? We tried Pollos Marios and thought the chicken was tasteless and very disappointing. Have now ordered the roasted chicken from Warique twice and loved it both times. Juicy and tasty! Maybe it&#039;s the salt that we like, but it was really delicious, as was everything else we tried--rice, beans, maduros--except for the fish filet dish, which was very plain. Have not ordered from Pio Pio in years, maybe we&#039;ll try that again for a better comparison. And once it&#039;s not so very hot, maybe I will walk up to El Pollo Inka Peru sometime, since we can&#039;t get delivery from them.

					Yeah, I am a well-informed New Yorker, and I know all about the apps and the restaurants and the issues. However, they are not all set up for ordering directly--if they were, why would they remain on the other platforms? And isn&#039;t it better for them to have the business however they get it? We order A LOT. <br /><br />In the case of Warique --their phone was in fact not in service, so how would we order from them if not online? We are older people who are not going to walk all the way to them from our apartment. And when ordering online, it&#039;s cashless, no contact, and safer for us. We remain healthy, hungry customers who continue to spend money ordering from them.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that on the whole better for them as well as for us? Don&#039;t let the perfect get in the way of the good.

					In the case of El Pollo Inka Peru, though, DoorDash seems to be their only online option for delivery, but DoorDash was saying they were closed, which is not the case. Maybe if DoorDash ever delivers for them again, they would deliver further? But when I called to try and order directly from them, they said they would not deliver to 76th St, it was too far. I do go to individual restaurant&#039;s own apps or websites to order when it is possible, but I don&#039;t think El Pollo Inka Peru has an app or website option...and anyway they have the 10-block limit.<br /><br />As it happens we did order from Warique last night--and for the first time had a problem. We ordered through Seamless and ten minutes past the time Seamless said the food would arrive, Warique called to apologize and tell us they had a system outage and only just then did they get our order. And do we still want it? <br /><br />We said yes, and they said it would take 30 minutes. After 45 minutes-1 hour (and this is a real problem for us as my spouse is diabetic and needs to eat when blood sugar is falling and it was already very late for him) they still had not arrived and we tried to call them. Phone not working. We finally contacted Seamless who also tried calling and found the phone not working. Seamless refunded our money--and shortly after the food arrived.<br /><br />I tried to reverse the refund via Seamless twice, and they said it&#039;s not possible to reverse a refund. So I plan to go over to the restaurant later and pay them. I&#039;m sure there was an electrical or internet outage that caused this, and not their fault, but it was very frustrating to not be able to reach them by phone at all, and not know for sure if they would ever arrive. Their food is great and well priced, so I still recommend. Just wish that if they have internet phone they&#039;d cover their bases and have a mobile phone as well, so customers can reach them.

					Yes, indeed, I can count! I meant I was surprised that they have a 10-block limit for delivery. Seems like a small delivery area and we are able to get deliveries from lots of places further away. Especially now when delivery is the name of the game.

					My decision: Warique it is! Just ordered a second time. It was very good and not very expensive, they deliver to my address...yay! Riko&#039;s had a lot of very negative reviews--so much so, I didn&#039;t want to even try it.

					FYI--though Doordash said El Pollo Inka Peru would deliver to us, it also said they were closed temporarily. But when I called, they are open and they do deliver, but when I told her my address she said no, I&#039;m too far away. I&#039;m on 76 St between 35th and 37th. Surprised--I think she said they only deliver within 10 blocks. Again--surprised!

					Thanks for the mini review JH Foodie! Tried Warique last night and we were very pleased. Loved the chicken and green sauce. We also ordered maduros, delicious, the salsa criolla, very good, and a fish filet with rice and fried yuca. The rice was supposed to be yellow rice, but they sent white, and I don&#039;t understand the appeal of yuca--but overall we will definitely order again. And now I want to try the others on your list--already have tried Pio Pio and was looking for other options. Riko and El Pollo Inka next. (In the time of covid, what to have for dinner takes on outsized importance.)
