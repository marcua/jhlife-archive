				NOPE. Don&#039;t know any place probably cuz I don&#039;t eat them.&nbsp; Surprised that Legends doesn&#039;t have them!&nbsp; Speak to them.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t it be great if Mystic Planet ended up having them!&nbsp; You&#039;d think I&#039;d remember a Menu with so few items on it, BUT I DON&#039;T.<br />&nbsp;:buck2:<br /><br />

				Legends does have wings and they vary from only OK to pretty good but I find the quality inconsistent.

				This question calls for urgent research!&nbsp; <br /><br />According to my menu pile, the following places serve Buffalo Wings:<br />Gianni Pizza<br />The Ranger at Legends<br />Jackson House<br />Original American Chicken<br />Peppino&#039;s Pizza<br />Cafe 89<br /><br />But which are good?&nbsp; We need to organize some tastings!<br /><br />If nobody has good, genuine buffalo wings, I&#039;ll settle for the hot wings at UFC.

				Unidentified Flying Chickens, at 71-22 Roosevelt.&nbsp; It&#039;s a Korean Fried Chicken place.&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s some discussion about it over here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=605.0).

				Cross Original American Chicken off the list.&nbsp; I tried their &quot;buffalo wings&quot; today.&nbsp; They were tasty, but they were breaded and only mildly spicy, a far cry from a proper buffalo wing.&nbsp; Five to go!

				Have you tried &quot;Big Boys&quot; bar on 75th and 31st Avenue across from Danta&#039;s near the shopping center?&nbsp; They have good wings there (or at least they did) I haven&#039;t been there in a long time!&nbsp; Hey and from what I remember this is a good bar to hangout at and kick back but, its a long walk if you live near 37th Ave.<br /><br />
