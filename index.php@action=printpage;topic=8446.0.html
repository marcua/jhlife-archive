				Hello Everyone,<br />My husband and I live in a one bedroom at Terrace View. <br />I need more closet space!<br /><br />We have 2 small closets in the bedroom (plus 1 coat closet and 1 linen closet).<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of adding a wall or screen in the bedroom to give us more storage space for our clothes. <br />My room is already cluttered with 3 different size dressers. <br />And I like open uncluttered spaces. <br /><br />Anyone have any closet work done? Any recommendations? Ideas?<br />&nbsp;:D<br />

				Have you thought about a pre-made unit like this one? http://www.contempospace.com/bedroom-furniture/wardrobe-closets/aventa-bedroom-wall-units-wardrobes.html<br /><br />I don&#039;t know anything about the quality of these, but I did notice they come assembled and there is free delivery and in-home setup in NYC.

				seems to me that permanently decreasing the size of a bedroom wouldn&#039;t be ideal for resale...unless the room is enormous to begin with. I&#039;d probably replace one of the dressers with a large wardrobe that maximizes space floor to ceiling. ikea has some decent options depending on your taste and budget. This one (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40208022/#/40208022) at least has door frames and panels made from solid wood...not sure about the side panels. Granted it&#039;s only pine, but that&#039;s still better than fiberboard. I don&#039;t own this model so I can&#039;t vouch for it, but in my experience ikea stuff is built better than the competing disposable furniture and is usually cheaper.

				Hey guys and gals,<br /><br />I noticed that one of the mods mentioned our furniture. Thanks for that!<br /><br />Just wanted to let you know that we make everything to order, so it&#039;s definitely doable to come up with something that will fit your needs and space.<br /><br />And yes, since we&#039;re right across the river in Passaic we deliver and set everything up at no charge to NYC customers. As to quality, we stand behind everything with a lifetime warranty, and have a showroom where we encourage people to check out our handiwork first hand.<br /><br />The free standing wardrobes have base heights of 72&quot; or 84&quot;, and those heights can each be extended by +14&quot;, +22&quot; or +34&quot;<br /><br />So if replacing a dresser or two with something full height is the direction you&#039;re considering, or even using a wardrobe with finished back as a room divider, we have designers here who can help you get what you need.<br /><br />We also do make a full array of custom closets, for installation within existing closets. Shelves, drawers... stuff to make the closets that are already there more efficient. We send our own people to install those as well.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t want to clutter up your thread with a bunch of promotional stuff. I just wanted to come on and say thanks for the mention, and let you know that we&#039;re a bit different from the usual bunch of furniture resellers.<br /><br />Have an awesome day!&nbsp; :)<br />--Chris
