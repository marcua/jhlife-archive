				Okay I am a mom to a four year old and a 14 month old now x-mas season has already started and unfortunately for me my daughter wants one of those damn zhu zhu pets lol.... Now I heard a rumor that cvs pharmacy has/ had or will have them this week.... If any of you spot these mysterious creatures at any local cvs please let me know.... Or if anyone wants to help a mom out and buy one or two for me I would be willing to pick up from you and reimburse you.... Please don&#039;t snatch the joy out of the holiday season by buying these little creatures and selling them for 5x the retail price... All you are doing is making lots of kids very sad and making these economic times a little tougher on the working parents... Spread the joy of the holidays....merry Christmas all only 24 days to go! ::)

				Too bad you didn&#039;t post this yesterday.&nbsp; I was doing a bit of Cyber Monday shopping at Amazon and came across some Zhu Zhu pets in my Gold Box.&nbsp; Just out of curiosity, what&#039;s the usual asking price for them?&nbsp; The price I was getting was $5.99, and that seemed low.&nbsp; I know that popular holiday toys are expensive, so the pricing could have been a mistake.&nbsp; In any event, if I come across anymore, I&#039;ll let you know.

				Chuckster they are pretty cheap between 8-10 dollars which is why they fly off the shelves and have been very lucrative to resellers.... I just walked in to cvs on northern and 90 and they had the accessories just not the actual hamster &nbsp;&gt;:( &nbsp;thinking of taking a trip to the 70&#039;s and see if I can find one there if not I&#039;ll keep stopping by everyday on the off chance I find one on the shelves.... Again if anyone does find them at a local cvs please let me know asap Or just get me one or two (2 is better as I have 2 kids) and I will gladly mee you and reimburse you for your purchase....my daughter is asking for one for x-mas and I would hate to disappoint her but if I can&#039;t find one I guess she&#039;ll just have to wait.... Spread some holiday cheer! &nbsp;
