					I don&#039;t want to name him because like i said, he was recommended by someone who did in fact have a good experience with him. In his defense, he was an older guy, who seemed to have a lot of experience as he said he did.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this case he was clearly very mistaken. My point was to always get a few estimates and i think most people will learn from different opinions I wonder what he would have done had i paid him, and the leak continued.&nbsp; Think he would have refunded my money? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t think so. And when i think about it, i did in fact mention the Wax Ring to him on his second visit, but i guess that would have made a $1800 job, a simple $100 job. So i guess my point is, if your toilet&nbsp; leaks, check the ring first!! <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />

					I heard awhile back that the bakery on the corner of 37th and 85th? was applying to get an outside seating cafe&nbsp; liscence. The process takes at least four months, and this was about 6 months ago. The rules and regulations are daunting, and about ten pages long. The requirements are quite stringent, and i dont think most restaurants on 37th ave would qualify. The sidewalks are cleary wide enough to meet approval, and im sure 37th ave is zoned for it, but thats the least of it. I think the cost involved prohibits alot of these places from serving food outside. Rent has to be paid to the city, and extra insurance needs to be had for each seat. i dont think their can be outside seating on the side streets, because they are zoned residential. Also, i dont think most of the existing restaurants are wide enough to meet standards. I think most restaurants that have outdoor seating on city/public property, existed before the Zoning laws were changed in 1980. Its much more difficult to put tables and chairs outside these days <img src="Smileys/default/angry.gif" alt="&gt;&#58;&#40;" title="Angry" class="smiley" />

					I don&#039;t want to say who not to use, but i had someone who was recommended on this board check out a leaky toilet that was leaking from the second floor bathroom.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t to happy. He said the kitchen ceiling had to be broken to fix the leaky pipe. Uh Oh, does that mean breaking parts of the 100 year old tiled wall as well? Yup, but he said &quot;you could find the same 100 year old tiles on e bay or craigslist.&quot;<br />&nbsp; HA Ha. Ha<br />&nbsp;i asked how do you know&nbsp; where the leak is coming from? His answer was the pipes are 100 years old, and that&#039;s what it was. And he told me he has been doing plumbing for the past 30 years. Yup, he said &quot;that&#039;s where its coming from.&quot;&nbsp; No Doubt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmmmm. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And i asked &quot;how much would i get to pay you to do&nbsp; this?&quot;&nbsp; $1800. Nice.... And that&#039;s not including repairing the damaged walls and ceilings.&nbsp; I had serious doubts. I spoke to a friend who is a super.&nbsp; &quot;Wax Ring.&quot; I said what? &quot;Wax Ring.&quot;&nbsp; He came over, we lifted the toilet, and&nbsp; yes, the 100 year old wax ring was indeed decomposed. We went to that great little hardware store, on 88th and 37th, A $10 wax ring, and a little epoxy later, my ceiling has been dry for the past 2 months. So everyone, get multiple estimates BEFORE committing to the first one that comes buy. And dont take recommendations as fool proof. They help, but buyer beware. <br />&nbsp;

					I also went to the Shell for an inspection. They told me i needed new brakes and something else. I didnt believe them. Paid the $45, and went to aother place in the ity. Lo and Behold, i passed inspection with no work needed to be done. Their prices may be in line with others, but they make their money by doing work that doesnt need to be done.

					Hi, I have a business on the LES, and also in the Village. As much as i love the city, i cant wait to leave after I&#039;m done working! The weekends there are torture, like you were saying with all the bars and clubs. Ive lived here for 20 years, first in a 1200 sq foot pre war, than a private home. When i was younger, i lived in the city, and got it out of my system. As you get older, space and quiet mean alot. As far as the commute, i took the subways for years, but now i drive in, but fortunately, the opposite times of rush hours. You need to take the time and check out a few open houses and see what the apts are like. I don&#039;t know what your space is like, but jackson Heights is known for its large pre war Apts. Everything is cheaper here, that&#039;s for sure, and you ll get almost everything you need on 37Th ave. Except of course books and clothes! But, we have good supermarkets, Meat markets, and a number of really good restaurants, that are affordable. And one bonus is that you can actually have a car!! The Jackson Heights Beautification Group is having a walking tour in June. Its a great way to get a feel of the neigh boorhood. Best of Luck

					Hi Thanks for your links.. She has a large yard and does run around all day, plus she has three floor&#039;s of stairs she goes up and down. She is active for the most part. And only two years old. Ive started cooking for her, boiled chicken, no skin, Steamed Broccoli and carrots, an occasional egg, fat free cottage cheese, and for dinner she gets the diet wellness brand. 1/2 cup people food&nbsp; in the am. and 1/2 cup dog food at night. But when she is alone, i do give her a few bisquits ( well 5 or 6 for the day, but they are the small ones)in that plastic kong toy to keep her busy. She never gets table food, but always appears to be starving to death. Always begging. She is a Puggle, and I&#039;ve seen a few huge ones,so i know the consequences of her being overweight. But shes gaining, not losing!!!

					That would be my house on 86th. The star of the show was Susan Mello, who is also a Jackson Heights resident. It was Throw Down with Bobby Flay..the burger episode if anyone wants to tivo it! It was great fun! You may even recognize a few neighbors. Also john Popper and HBO shot an episode inside the house for his new show, i think its called ZRock? I haven&#039;t seen it, and unfortunately, never figured out how to use my TIVO (hint for Bradon <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/smiley.gif" alt="&#58;&#41;" title="Smiley" class="smiley" />&nbsp; It was the third episode. If it comes on, id love to see how it comes out.

					The Fundraiser is to raise money to purchase the metal tree surrounds on 37th ave. Ive been having the party for the past 6 years, and really enjoy having the opportunity to have an event like this.I think the event purchased like 30 tree surrounds thru the years.&nbsp; Its a garden Party, so the dress is casual. The food is great, as is the live music. Its 3 hours of eating, drinking and getting to know your neighbors( if you want to <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" /> If your new to Jackson heights, its a great way to see one of the oriiginal English Garden Homes.&nbsp; But since this is at a private home,&nbsp; i have to limit the number of Tickets to 125, and respectfully ask, adults only.&nbsp; Richard
