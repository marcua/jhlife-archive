					I was just today peering into the windows of Biryani Pointe and hoping they were actually closed for good--and now I find this thread! This is just terrific. We moved to JH in October 2011 and were delighted to find Mehfil, the restaurant that was formerly in that space. We live just around the corner, and we loved Mehfil. <br /><br />Then it closed and was replaced by that chain and instead of the fairly nice atmosphere and vibe of Mehfil—and food we really enjoyed—we had the glaring lights, the TV, the ugly Coke machine in the dining room. Then, even worse, that garish chicken place opened in a former dry cleaning shop. I almost cried when I saw it. I don&#039;t care who you are or what you are selling—a little sense of aesthetics, please! By comparison, on the same block a similarly casual mostly breakfast and lunch place, El Rico Tinto, has pleasing decor, good food and friendly service. That was a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Their egg dishes are great for brunch.<br /><br />I am thrilled to hear about your new restaurant, Stew. By family friendly, people probably mean having menu items children would eat (some simple choices like roast chicken or a good hamburger) and not having an atmosphere so formal that parents would feel uncomfortable bringing their children. It looks to me like you do want to be more on the formal/fine dining side and less on the casual family dining side, which to me is a place like Bare Burger. <br /><br />I agree that it&#039;s crucial to make sure the acoustics and music allow for conversation. One of the things I liked about Armondo&#039;s was that it was not too noisy and was a relaxing place to eat basic Italian comfort food.&nbsp; I&#039;m at the stage of life where I will leave a restaurant that is too noisy before even sitting down. I just can&#039;t scream all night and I really dislike the constant, headache-inducing clamor. Everyone I know (granted I don&#039;t hang out with kids) feels the same way. Even if I am dining alone, I hate when it&#039;s too noisy.<br /><br />Arunee is an example of a place that is too loud for my taste, and I think that&#039;s from the choice of decor. It was not so loud in its former incarnation, Novo, to my recollection. I also find the uncushioned wooden bench seating uncomfortable--and the food, unfortunately, went downhill after the move. Not that I went there more than a few times, but I liked it more when it was in its former location.<br /><br />Your mood board looks great. Do you have a name? I think this will do well (especially if it&#039;s not TOO formal and upscale, which I am not sure would work as well here). I think there is pent-up demand for this kind of a place. Really looking forward to your opening!

					My sentiments exactly. I was excited to think it might be closed. We stopped shopping there when they had the dispute with their workers, and since then I&#039;ve wondered how they stay in business since they never appear to be busy. I pass by on my way to work and back, and I usually see a couple of customers at the registers and a couple more in the aisles. But I think I&#039;ve seen it closed before, and it didn&#039;t mean anything. Sigh.

					There is a sign in the former Vincent&#039;s Beauty Salon saying &quot;We&#039;ll be open April 13.&quot; Did another salon take over the space? That was fast. These storefronts seem to most often stay empty for a long, long time when a business closes.

					Redge may have been a bit too vociferous in his comment (why am I assuming Redge is male?) but he makes good points.&nbsp; I looked up that website and also got a bad impression of the place well before it even exists. Why don&#039;t business owners understand that a website is their calling card and it needs to be professional and comprehensible? I actually see a lot of restaurant websites that don&#039;t make it easy to find the information you are looking for when looking for a place to eat. And I agree, of course, that creative people should be paid for their work.

					The complexes you are looking at (except for the Towers, I think) are made up of small individual coops. So the issue of being somewhat of an absentee owner can be a problem, because a small coop needs all hands on deck to help run the building. I live in Hawthorne Court in a self-managed building of 10 apartments, and there really is a lot of work that goes into running the building. When several apartments are owned by people who don&#039;t really live here, it&#039;s hard to divvy up the work in a way that&#039;s fair. It&#039;s not board meetings so much as it is keeping the books, paying vendors, dealing with elevator maintenance issues, building plumbing issues, the laundry machines in the basement, various city agencies who change the rules and issue violations that have to be cleared, etc. <br /><br />We once had a serious water leak on a major holiday (in an absentee owner&#039;s apartment) and someone (me, as it happened) had to stay home and deal with the plumber. Another time one of us had to go to some city agency to deal with a new plumbing requirement. It&#039;s a lot of work, but the upside is we have lower maintenance payments because in addition to having no underlying mortgage, we have no managing agent and no salaried staff (just a live-in part-time super who receives a free apartment in exchange for maintenance work, along with minor compensation.)<br /><br />I just spoke to a neighbor in another HC building who said that they recently turned down an applicant, and one of the reasons was that the person traveled much of the time for work, and they want someone who will be there and be willing to pitch in and help run the place. I know our house feels the same way and when we interview an applicant, we make sure they know that we expect them to help with the shared &quot;chores&quot; of the building. I sometimes think that living in a bigger coop with professional management would be easier.&nbsp; It&#039;s something to keep in mind. But we decided on this because of the lower cost, as well as the charm of the apartments and the convenient location. The downside is, we do have to put in time to help run the place.<br /><br />

					I am all for the Mom and Pop shops, personal service, etc, but there are a few things that are unfortunately pushing me to give more of my business to the chains vs the small pharmacies—even though I am philosophically opposed to the takeover of chain drug stores. <br /><br />One, the convenience of longer hours. I had some items I needed a few Sundays ago, and only a small amount of time in which to get them. I went by Frank&#039;s Pharmacy, but they were just locking up at 3 PM. So I went to Duane Reade. <br /><br />Second, the quality of goods. I went to Frank&#039;s Pharmacy in December to buy all my gift wrap and gift tags. The only gift wrap they carried was so extremely substandard, thin, and cheap cheap cheap, it disintegrated in your hands when you tried to wrap it around a box. I literally could not do anything with it -- it kept tearing. So when I needed gift wrap for Valentine&#039;s Day, I again went to Duane Reade. <br /><br />We had been loyal Maram customers and went nowhere else while they were still around. But now--I&#039;m pretty much going to Duane Reade. And that&#039;s how it happens. <br /><br />I wish that Frank&#039;s—for one example because I am not really familiar with the others—would step up the quality of some of their merchandise. I know people love the place. I had not used them before, and I have to say I have been disappointed in this regard. As for the service at the pharmacy itself, I have found Duane Reade and Frank&#039;s to be equally responsive and nice and personalized and helpful.

					So okay, Armondo&#039;s is not Da Silvano or any of the top-rated Italian restaurants in Manhattan. As others have stated, it was and presumably still is a nice, white tablecloth, sit-down neighborhood restaurant, in an attractive setting, with a full bar, serving decent Italian food. We had one not-good experience there with a scallops dish that was sub-par, but on many other occasions we enjoyed the food (especially their grilled fish over garlic spinach and their mushroom ravioli) and the dining experience. It gave people in JH a choice that was not Indian, Tibetan, Thai, Nepalese, or South American, for times when what was wanted was something plainer, for their kids, for the in-laws, whatever...in other words, a choice of an American-style, old-fashioned Italian restaurant. And there were plenty of people who wanted that and still do. I have missed Armondo&#039;s!<br /><br />Because it&#039;s not a temple of gastronomy, and maybe does not offer &quot;true formal&quot; service (or whatever is the opposite of &quot;pseudo-formal&quot; service) does not mean it doesn&#039;t have its place. I find it very curious to make the leap that if people in JH like Armondo&#039;s they won&#039;t like the sort of restaurant Redge is talking about— the implication being that their taste is not refined enough. Makes no sense to me. There is room for all kinds of places, serving a variety of needs and tastes. No? <br /><br />That said, if Redge is looking for assurances that there is a sufficient audience for a really innovative, upscale restaurant here, and frankly, I am not sure there is. People seem more interested in a comfortable, family friendly but still attractive place, serving well prepared food made of excellent ingredients. They are not necessarily looking for the next big breakthrough in cuisine in an upscale, formal atmosphere. I think people would be fine with going to Manhattan for that kind of experience, and they won&#039;t be doing it every night. That&#039;s why they live in JH. If they had the money and inclination to eat at very fancy places all the time—I just don&#039;t think they would be living here. <br /><br />I am thinking of a friend who married an affluent guy who lived on Park Avenue. She visited me here, and we had lunch at E77 and walked around a bit. I suggested she bring her husband out sometime to dine at one of the interesting places here. She said, &quot;Well, he really doesn&#039;t go to that sort of restaurant.&quot; For him, I assume, only something on the level of Odeon or The Gotham Grill or Per Se would do. I think people like her husband are the main market for very upscale restaurants, and those people don&#039;t live in JH. This may seem blindingly obvious--and it is--but I am trying to make a distinction that is meaningful for Redge and partners, I think.&nbsp; Yes, there definitely is a market for an American/European nice, but fairly casual restaurant—bistro, gastropub, however you want to identify it—but not a very fancy, formal, upscale place, featuring unusual cuisine at pretty high prices. IMHO.<br /><br />I am looking forward to The Queensboro, hoping it will hit the sweet spot for a different and nice dining option in JH.

					I agree--if they can&#039;t run the place in a professional way—and food service is HARD—it won&#039;t succeed. I&#039;ve seen it before. Someone without experience wants to start a restaurant or takeout place and just can&#039;t make it run properly. Instead, it&#039;s amateurish—they get orders wrong, run out of half the items on the menu, serve only 3 of the 4 dinners ordered at the same time, then bring the last one half an hour later.&nbsp; Patrons don&#039;t come back and the place goes under. People underestimate just how demanding it is to make it work.

					Huh? How does the existence of these sky-high rents equate to some sort of idealistic vision of a non-gentrified, anti-capitalist community (or whatever you are suggesting) with equal opportunity for all? So what you seem to be saying is, we should be happy with the status quo (which is that nobody can afford to open a business here at all unless they are the recipient of some special sweetheart deal or they are possibly money launderers) and if not, we are evil, privileged, whiny interloper/gentrifiers?&nbsp; Maybe what you mean is that yes, people are getting special deals based on ethnicity and that&#039;s the way it should be? I just don&#039;t understand the comment.

					Londonjo--where is the &quot;jovial fish place&quot;? Sounds...well, jovial! A word I rarely encounter. Perhaps you are British? Interesting idea, kind of a more downscale Chelsea Market? Could it possibly bring in the big bucks the landlord is looking for? I just don&#039;t know how the huge rents being asked for can be dealt with.

					Redge, I&#039;m on the edge of my seat awaiting a big announcement from you. All of this should be the basis for someone&#039;s PhD dissertation. Why is the law of supply and demand not functioning here? Why would the rents asked for here be far higher than space near the High Line? I&#039;m still in need of remedial help. I just don&#039;t understand how this can be.
