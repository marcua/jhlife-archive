				I am deathly allergic to cats and dogs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I have any other animal allergies.&nbsp; Hypoallergenic cats still trigger a response.&nbsp; Love animals and really want a small, smart, cuddly pet.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

				I am not sure what to suggest, but your post made me think of this video I just saw posted on facebook.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cat cuddling with a bearded dragon, which I would never have thought of as being a cuddly animal.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be surprised and find a pet that is unexpectedly cuddly.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xl4L-6OF_A&amp;feature=player_embedded

				I&#039;ve known people that really loved their ferrets, rabbits and chinchillas... are you also allergic to those?<br /><br />My brother has a bird... I think birds are ridiculously messy but while not cuddly in the usual sense it does spend a lot of time on his hand and shoulder

				Thanks for the suggestions, guys!<br /><br />My building allows pets so I&#039;m really interested in getting one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone here ever had a Dwarf Bunny as a pet?&nbsp; I heard they can be quite cute and fun pets....

				Rabbits can be wonderful but require ALOT of work. THey also can develop health problems ( I sure know about that) they need alot of exercise and toys to chew (some will chew anything/everything-wires included) they can be trained to use the litter box. They also get lonely so one is probably not enough. I had rabbits for many years (they live a long time too) and will NEVER get another caged animal. It is so much work.

They can be neurotic and needy and will start pulling out their feathers from stress if they are left home alone most of the day.<br /><br />They are also very messy, so if you hate to clean they are not for you.&nbsp; And loud.&nbsp; Don&#039;t forget loud.&nbsp; If you are in an apartment building your neighbors will probably not be happy.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love birds; if I could have a pet a parrot would be my first choice (I grew up with a Blue-fronted Amazon and we were best friends. He was a great talker).&nbsp; But they are a lot of work and people shouldn&#039;t just buy a big parrot without having owned a smaller bird first.&nbsp; Rescues are full of big birds because people don&#039;t realize what they are getting into and can&#039;t deal with the mess and noise.&nbsp; But they can be very rewarding if you do your research first and decide it&#039;s the right pet for you.&nbsp; <br /><br />rhydewithdis, do you have an African Grey?&nbsp; Just curious.&nbsp; I love them.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m allergic to cats and dogs but found a toy poodle is ok.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had mine going on 4 years now without any problems allergy wise.<br /><br />As you can tell from the above posts, all pets are work and require time, energy and hate to be alone for long periods.&nbsp; &nbsp;Research carefully before you get anything.&nbsp; There are tons of websites devoted to almost any pet where you can learn the pros and cons along with cost to own.<br /><br />Good luck.&nbsp; I will say that having my little dog has added more benefits to my life then opposite.

				I really want a pet to keep in my room but my lively hood sometime means I may leave home for 3 to 4 day a couple times a year. My mom doesnâ€™t like rodents one bit and I have a 4 year old sister so I need something that I can trust to be okay if my sister messes with it while Iâ€™m not home. It needs to be minimal on smell and be okay to leave at a friends house for a couple of days. If anyone can give me a good animal that is cost efficient and is fairly hardy, I would really appreciate it. Also, please include supplies that I would need and the care it requires. Thanks!

				Hi Mack, I don&#039;t know too much about iguanas, but you might want to look into seeing what kind of care they need.&nbsp; My friend had one when we were in HS and she really loved it. I think rabbits or birds might be too much work for your needs.&nbsp; A guinea pig might be fun, but I don&#039;t know if they are too rodent-like for your mom.&nbsp;

				<strong>I WANT TO GIVE AWAY A PAIR OF LITTLE BIRDS WITH THE CAGE. <br /><br />The Housekeeper made a comment about the birds that led me to decide they would be better off with someone else.&nbsp; They are literally maintenance free (relatively speaking).&nbsp; Change the water everyday (every other day some times)&nbsp; fill their seeds up every 2 or 3 days.&nbsp; Change the bottom of their cage ever few days.&nbsp; You might spend 30 to 45 minutes per week total.</strong><br /><br />
