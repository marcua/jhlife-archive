				This place is in Fresh Meadows. It sounds like delivery is available but it&#039;s also possible there&#039;s a wait list to even get to order delivery.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/mly0jrw.png)<br /><br /><strong>A New Kind of Hot Chicken, from Pecking House</strong><br /><br />These days, moments of joy seem to arrive mostly by surprise, offering brief relief from the dull feeling that weeks and months are blurring together. The other night, one came via cheap beer. It was Tsingtao, a pale lager, produced by China’s second-largest brewery, with an easy-drinking flavor profile that’s as carefully calibrated and comforting as Coca-Cola’s. I’d never had a Tsingtao at home but have rarely eaten in a Chinese restaurant without ordering one, if not two, especially to pair with anything spicy, its sweet, yeasty, almost creamy roundness cutting obligingly through heat.<br /><br />I hadn’t realized how much I missed it until I opened a bag of food dropped off by Eric Huang, the impressively pedigreed Taiwanese-American chef behind a new takeout-and-delivery operation called Pecking House. Two bottles were packed in ice, keeping the beers crisp and cold; my first sip felt like a portal to a former life. It was delicious on its own and a consummate foil for the salty, fiery seasoning on Huang’s singular fried chicken, the centerpiece of what is essentially a meat-and-three meal.<br /><br />Huang spent time in the kitchens of Café Boulud and Gramercy Tavern before earning the title of sous-chef at Eleven Madison Park; last year, he left, with plans to open a Michelin-star-worthy restaurant of his own. In the early months of the pandemic, he helped his mother, who owns a restaurant on Long Island, as she adapted her business. Once they had established protocols for outdoor dining and to-go orders, he turned to Peking House, his uncle’s restaurant in Queens, which belonged to Huang’s parents in the nineties and is where he spent much of his childhood.<br /><br />read more:<br />https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/14/a-new-kind-of-hot-chicken-from-pecking-house

				More like a ghost kitchen selling fried chicken. I still missed the old school Peking House experience. Wonder if they&#039;d ever reopen...
