				I was reading about Informed Delivery and it sounds promising as a way to track your mail. Has anyone tried it? It&#039;s free, and I just signed up, so hopefully soon I&#039;ll be able to give some feedback.<br /><br /><strong>Informed Delivery® by USPS®</strong><br />Digitally preview your mail and manage your packages scheduled to arrive soon! Informed Delivery allows you to view greyscale images of the exterior, address side of letter-sized mailpieces and track packages in one convenient location.*<br /><br />https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action

				I have been using informed delivery.&nbsp; &nbsp;I get 99% of items same day.&nbsp; It has stopped neighbors from tampering with larger envelopes since I know when they are arriving.

				The USPS Informed Delivery alerts are great, several times we only found out about missing mail because something showed up in an Informed Delivery alert but never actually arrived.<br /><br />UPS and FedEx also offer similar alert services as well

				My mail is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad. Multiple times each month mail doesn&#039;t arrive to my box. This month I didn&#039;t receive my ConEd bill. Last October a mailing from SS Admin. never arrived, which contained all my info.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how Informed Delivery could or would reduce theft and misdeliveries. <br /><br />The USPS is replacing street boxes with anti-fishing boxes (not sure where I read that). They seem to have permanently removed all of them in my area.

I get magazines months behind, bills late or never. We are lucky if we get mail on Fridays and Saturdays and have a different mail person weekly. I&#039;ve complained to no avail!! I tried signing up for this and it says it is not available for my address.

				I only receive my ConEd bill once every two or three months. My other bills seem to arrive regularly, but not ConEd. It&#039;s weird.

				Been using it for a few years; really glad I took advantage of it. It’s great when you’re away too.&nbsp; In my experience I’ve only seen letter sized mail; magazines and larger envelopes don’t show up in the notices
