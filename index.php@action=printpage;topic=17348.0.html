				A few months ago my friend reached out for help with his cousin&#039;s cat BouBou. The cousin was nearing the birth of her first child and was about to give BouBou to a shelter. I took him in, hoping that he could get along with my boy Danny. Sadly, despite all of the videos and tricks and advice I have been given and tried, the two are still deeply at odds, and BouBou has lived in fear. I contacted his original owners and they had no interest in taking him back.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />BouBou is sweet and loving, loves to sit and cuddle, but should <span class="bbc_u">definitely</span> be placed in a one-cat home. He would be great for anyone looking for a mellow guy who just wants some cuddles and occasional chin rubs. He has had all of his shots (I was told when I took him in) and has been healthy and well. I can provide supplies and a carrier to the right person who is looking to add some cat love to their life! I&#039;m including a photo below. PM me if you are interested. Thanks!

				I don&#039;t understand people who adopt animals and then get rid of them when they become an inconvenience. It&#039;s one thing to try and find a new home for your pet when unforeseen circumstances (i.e. extreme and long term financial hardship; the birth of a child who ends up having severe allergies); it&#039;s another (really crappy) thing to decide that entirely predictable life events (having kids, short term job loss, getting married, moving, etc.) warrant dropping a pet off at a shelter. <br /><br />Good for you OP for trying to provide a home for this handsome fellow. I hope you are able to find him a permanent home, and please don&#039;t drop him off at a shelter.

				That&#039;s how I got my kitty, his former owners were going to take him to a shelter when they had their first child.&nbsp; So sad.&nbsp; He&#039;s a old man now, and he&#039;s been with me for more than 10 years.&nbsp; Wish I could take another, but that&#039;s not likely possible until I move come Spring.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please don&#039;t take him to a shelter.&nbsp; I&#039;d be happy to help in any way I can.

				Do you know how old he is? I&#039;ve been trying to ask around and see if there are any takers.
