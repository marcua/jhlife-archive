					And yet, the investor, while criticizing a neighborhood restaurant, never revealed that he was an investor in a different neighborhood restaurant. That&#039;s a little strange, in that the investor and the main owner are so hung up on transparency.&nbsp;

					Stew, I wish you the best of luck, yet you seem to be applying a double standard.&nbsp; You are defending your investor&#039;s attack on a Community Board member for posting about board business anonymously, and now you are leveling the same criticism.&nbsp; Yet your investor anonymously criticised a new neighborhood restaurant without revealing that he has sunk money into another new neighborhood restaurant and then he anonymously attacked the Community Board&#039;s liquor license process without revealing that the restaurant he put money into has, or will have, a liquor license application before the board.&nbsp; Full disclosure runs both ways.<br /><br />This is a nice neighborhood and most of us hope your place will be a nice addition.&nbsp; This forum allows people to express their opinions anonymously.&nbsp; That&#039;s how it operates.&nbsp; Moreover, Community Board members donate their time on behalf of the neighborhood fulfilling an important civic function.&nbsp; They have the same right to express their opinions, anonymously, as the rest of us.&nbsp; They shouldn&#039;t be penalized just because they volunteer their time to the community.&nbsp; In any event, isn&#039;t it time we move beyond this and look forward to your grand opening.

					One more observation Stew.&nbsp; Redge leveled heavy criticism against someone for commenting on the Community Board without revealing that he or she is a member of the Board and for not using his or her real name.&nbsp; No need to rehash what Redge said, it is all here in the thread.<br /><br />But what strikes me is that Redge, in two different threads, has criticized a new neighborhood restaurant, Bauche, without revealing in those threads that he or she is an investor in a soon-to-be new neighborhood restaurant and without revealing his or her real name, unless, of course, his or her real full name is just Redge.<br /><br />Redge asked for transparency, but shouldn&#039;t Redge too be transparent.&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp;

If you think that our Community Board should spend its time on &quot;more important&quot; issues, the solution is to cut the Board, and local interests, out of the process.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the granting of liquor licenses, or not, affects the lives of a hell of a lot of people, including in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />By the way, a document setting forth the Board&#039;s process would take less than two pages. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=13396.msg63819#msg63819">Quote from: redge on June 22, 2015, 08:51:17 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=13396.msg63817#msg63817">Quote from: queenskid2 on June 22, 2015, 08:35:01 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I think Erospolitco is entitled to the same anonymity as the rest of us.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, let&#039;s have government officials (which Community Board members are) weigh in on their own operations anonymously.

					Not to get off the topic of legalization, but Queens was the first county in New York State to have a Human Trafficking Intervention Court.&nbsp; Many of the women are picked up on Roosevelt.&nbsp; They are screened and if trafficking is an issue the court works with service providers to &quot;rescue&quot; these women from the &quot;life.&quot;&nbsp; Anyone can go to the court and observe.&nbsp; Sometimes the pimps sit in the audience waiting for their &quot;property.&quot;<br /><br />The point is, people are finally beginning to look at these cases differently with the goal of treating many of these women as victims as opposed to criminals.&nbsp; The organizations that provide these services--from addiction, to immigration, to safe houses--need help.&nbsp; These new courts, which are now found around the city and in places outside NYC as well, have put a strain on the service providers who have reached their limit.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you want to learn more, Google NY Times and Queens Human Trafficking Court.&nbsp; A long article was published last year.&nbsp; We can do something to stop this modern day slavery which is happening right in our community.
