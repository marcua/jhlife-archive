Metro-North is proposing four new stations in the Bronx, but not one in Queens. What do you guys think about having a Metro-North station in Western Queens as well. There would be fast access to Penn Station and improved access to the Bronx, Westchester, and Connecticut for all Queens residents.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I could swear I already posted this.<br /><br />This is a dead topic. The MTA studied the route in 2002 as part of the initial Penn Station Access study. Please see pages 28-44 of this comprehensive report. <a href="http://web.mta.info/mta/planning/psas/pdf/comp_results.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://web.mta.info/mta/planning/psas/pdf/comp_results.pdf</a><br /><br />* A Woodside station was not seen as attracting sufficient ridership or reducing travel time<br />* A Sunnyside station had too poor projected ridership performance and too much diversion from other transit modes<br />* An Astoria station would be too expensive to build and would not attract enough riders<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think this has been mentioned:<br /><br />In 2002, Metro-North only considered 31st Street at the Ditmars Blvd Subway station for a Metro-North stop which is costly in part because the Amtrak viaduct is too high at that location. The Astoria station that the petition recently posted is asking Metro-North to look at would be located at Astoria Blvd. at 41st-44th Streets where the Amtrak viaduct is not as high and in an area which lacks rail service. <br /><br />The Woodside station considered is near the Woodside LIRR station. The petition that has recently been posted asks Metro-North to look at Northern Blvd/Broadway near Sports Authority where there would be transfers to the M and R trains.<br /><br />Western Queens has seen lots of growth between 2002 and 2014 for the need for Metro-North service not to be raised.

The reason is clear in that MTA report: the goal of adding stations here is to provide rail service in locations with no rail service. All of your proposed locations have existing subway service and so there wouldn&#039;t be a net increase in transit trips. The most interesting station location to me would be a Woodside link to create a connector between Metro-North and LIRR (which doesn&#039;t currently exist) but as the report points out, that&#039;s impossible.<br /><br />It would be much more useful to focus on re-adding Corona and Elmhurst stations on the LIRR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And the MTA wants to rebuild Elmhurst LIRR station as a part of the proposed 2015-2019 capital program and its not too far&nbsp; from the Elmhurst Avenue subway station (only a couple blocks), so that contradicts the goal of adding stations to provide rail service in locations with no rail service. At this rate we might as well build Metro-North stations in Western Queens so that people can be able to travel to locations outside of Long Island or Manhattan Island. Also one of the locations that the petition asks Metro-North to study is in a part of Astoria with no rail service.

					The proposed locations are not any of the locations mentioned in the study. The locations that this petition proposes a station be built are in areas with better ridership potential because of transfer opportunities afforded and lack of rail options and areas that are not technically challenging to build in. Metro-North failed to consider alternate locations that are better suited for a station in the study that you mentioned.

					The MTA has come out with their proposed 2015-2019 capital plan (which was rejected by a state review board) and has included the beginning steps for the Penn Station Access plan which would bring New Haven Line trains into Penn Station via the Amtrak right of way in the Bronx and Queens and open 4 new New Haven Line stations in the Bronx. Metro-North is clearly leaving Western Queens out in the cold by not providing New Haven Line service and its benefits to Western Queens, which has undergone lots of growth over the last decade. Furthermore, the Amtrak right of way in Western Queens is decrepit and is falling apart and needs to be repaired in order to better handle the burden of additional trains that the Penn Station Access plan proposes. <br /><br /><br />A petition is being circulated to call on Metro-North to bring New Haven Line service to Western Queens as a part of its Penn Station Access plan. This would improve travel between Western Queens and Manhattan and between Western Queens and the Bronx/Westchester/Connecticut and provide better transit service to a part of Queens that is growing. This petition also calls on Amtrak to make the necessary repairs along its right of way in Western Queens to better accommodate the additional trains that will be running through the Amtrak right of way in Western Queens.
