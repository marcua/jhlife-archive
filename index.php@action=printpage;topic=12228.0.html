				Second for Ayada.<br />Phayul is right up there.<br />Kitchen 79 shows promise. It&#039;s up there with Arunee, at a notch below Ayada.<br />In terms of sweets, Lety&#039;s and Cannelle Patisserie (the latter is one of the best French bakeries in the city).

				we tried it a couple weeks back. solid, basic, unspectacular coffee shop food. i had a BLT that was pretty much what you want in a BLT -- a good amount of bacon for the buck. my dining companion had a burger that she seemed pleased with. fries were crispy and not greasy. service was super eager and nice because the place was fairly empty.<br />overall, yeah, it&#039;s worth going back to.

				I&#039;ve ordered breakfast a few times on seemless from Roosevelt Diner and have been pleased. It is better than any of the other options on seemless, and the food was better than what I&#039;ve had at City Coffee, Ricky&#039;s or Jackson House. I still think the best diner breakfast in the neighborhood is Jax Inn.

				Wife and I went to Kitchen 79 last week. Really excellent. Their liquor license hadn&#039;t come through yet so it was BYO but that should be sorted out shortly.
