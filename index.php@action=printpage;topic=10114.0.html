				sl - GSMAYES - hfm:<br /><br />This is not a trolling, there is a point, and I am not a joke. <br />No one loves JH more than I do. And I think I can easily say that I have lived in the neighborhood longer than 3/4 of the members here. I am not putting down the place where I live. i happen to love it. But sometimes we do have take a truly objective look at things. That also means having a sense of humor about it and ourselves.<br /><br />If that causes anyone to think then it&#039;s a good thing. Lighten up.<br /><br />And for the other contibutors, thank you. What I hope to see here are thoughts for us all to consider for 2014 as the new year approaches.

				&quot;Starbucks guy&quot;&#039;s name is Ben. He neither asks for, nor accepts money. He mostly lives on the street, but has a place to stay when it&#039;s really necessary. He&#039;s a very smart man who does not drink or indulge in drugs. talk to him sometime. he&#039;s great.<br /><br />there are no trash cans on 34th or 35th because they&#039;re residential streets, the residents -- especially in the historic district -- have demanded there not be any. or so i was told in &#039;97, when i first asked that question of the cops and elected officials.

				back when my ex and I had a house between 34 and 35, we&#039;d constantly get ticketed for trash outside the house because of people walking by and tossing it there. we asked many many many times why we couldn&#039;t get a can placed on one corner or another and we were told they were prohibited.<br /><br />perhaps someone from the JHBG could comment as to whether or not trash cans are banned, and, if so, why.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=10114.msg52873#msg52873">Quote from: Superclam on December 05, 2013, 09:26:50 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But not on 34th Ave. My building put out their own garbage cans, so people won&#039;t throw their dog poop bags in the lobby garbage.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				My guess is that many of these cans are used by people who are illegally renting rooms or apartments. You see a an awful lot of house hold garbage thrown out in many of the cans on 37th Ave. I guess not having them discourages their use in this way. Personally, I prefer none on 34 and 35 because these are residential streets. When I walk my dog, or have a cup of coffee with me, I hold on to it until I hit 37th Avenue or until I reach home. As a home owner, it is frustrating picking up after people&#039;s garbage day in and day out, but my feeling is that people will continue to do this whether there are garbage cans or not. Look at 37th Ave.....I rest my case.

				having lived directly overlooking a corner on 35th for years now, I have to agree, Francis. yes, there are those who&#039;ll toss a cup,&nbsp; a wrapper or whatever, but a few of those, while bad, is better than a full, overflowing can.
