				I&#039;ve only been there once for a screening that was part of the Queens film festival. It&#039;s pretty much a dump, and I wouldn&#039;t pay to see a wide release there. However, it did serve a niche for non-english speakers in the community.

				Too bad, though I&#039;ve also only been there once to see a movie.&nbsp; It was in the winter time and I&#039;m pretty sure the theater was just as cold as it was outside. The lobby was nice and warm though...

				Wasn&#039;t there a push a few years ago to transform that cinema into an art house theater? Maybe that&#039;s still a possibility.

				while i&#039;d love to see that happen, I don&#039;t see how a theater showing fare that 10-15 percent&nbsp; -- at most -- of the populace would pay to see would make a go of it where a theater showing mainstream fare at a lower-than-average ticket price couldn&#039;t.

				This is sad news. I hope one day the theatre gets the investment it needs to restore it to its original glory. It&#039;s really a beautiful building.<br /><br />&nbsp;All the yelp reviews were pretty accurate. The family tried to make it work but I guess couldn&#039;t afford the upgrades necessary to show films at the same level of quality as the big name multiplexes.

				The Jackson was one of four movie houses in Jackson Heights in the 50s. The others were The Earle(now the Jackson Heights food court)The Boulevard on Northern at 82nd St. and The Colony on 82nd between 37th and Roosevelt What a time it was for movies. The admission wasn&#039;t much,the lobbies were kept clean and there were ushers and matrons there to keep some semblance of order. The format was a double feature that is an A film and a B picture thrown in, a cartoon , and of course coming attractions.<br />Every time I passed The Jackson over the last years of its decline I felt that I was seeing a grizzled old veteran that had seen better days and was now in its dotage. But who knows maybe like some long ago Hollywood ending the old Jackson will leap out of the grave to live again. One can only hope.

				The cinema industry is changing all around the world.&nbsp; They have to upgrade to digital now and that costs cinema owners big bucks...(eventually celluloid prints won&#039;t be distributed)...<br /><br />The positive of this... is that cinemas will be able to screen big events...sports/concerts/operas/theater etc...which is cool. These events have previously have been more limited... And I imagine it would be fun to sit in a cinema and watch your favorite band/sport/opera/actors with fellow fans. <br /><br />Whether someone takes on the Jackson...and is able to invest in the new technology...and update...is another matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Small cinemas everywhere are facing the same dilemma.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
