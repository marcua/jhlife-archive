				Hello<br />I have been trying for weeks on various websites to get the Covid vaccine but it is so confusing. Has any one else experience this and or have any advice? Ride Aid and Walgreens are just a block away from me- I go their websites and nothing. Did the .gov thing too<br />Any help would be great!

It depends on your age and other eligibility. Call 311, they will explain that to you too.

				If you&#039;re having trouble, I suggest contacting Epicenter NYC. They were founded by one of our neighbors here in JH. <br />https://epicenter-nyc.com/epicenters-vaccine-resources/<br /><br /><strong>Epicenter is helping our neighbors get vaccinated</strong><br /><br />&quot;Dear Reader,<br /><br />You might have heard that we’ve had some luck getting our neighbors signed up for vaccine appointments. What started out as a small word-of-mouth initiative for those in our community (and we use the word community inclusively: We’ve gotten appointments for upstate farmers, restaurant workers in Harlem, taxi drivers in Brooklyn and grandparents in Queens) has grown into something beyond us. We have dozens and dozens of volunteers who are eager to help, and we’ve successfully secured about 500 vaccine appointments — a number that’s growing rapidly.<br /><br />Do you need help getting a vaccine appointment? Please fill out our intake form. https://airtable.com/shr7lRDaT8BroQKGk<br /><br />VIDEO: How to book yourself for a vaccine; tips and tricks from an Epicenter volunteer.<br /><br />VIDEO: How to book a vaccine at the Javits Center &amp; other NY State locations, TIPS &amp; TRICKS!&quot;<br /><br />Go to https://epicenter-nyc.com/epicenters-vaccine-resources/ to see the video links.

				About a month ago, I tried booking an appointment at a Rite Aid for a few mornings with no luck before deciding to try at a different time of day.&nbsp; I tried in the afternoon one day and found a bunch of appointments open.&nbsp; It could be more difficult now that appointments have just opened up to everyone over 16.

				&nbsp;The CVS on Northern Blvd and 73rd has finally started to give the vaccines. There is a table in the front of the store with a real human being to speak to which might be what you need. I think the shots are given at a booth in the parking lot where there is a separate waiting room. Looks like a good local<br />setup.<br />

				Call 1 (877) 208-8318. <br /><br />I believe this goes directly to the NYC Health Dept. COVID hotline. I know of two people that were able to get appointments easily calling this number.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure 311 will direct you there as well.

				We used Turbovax.info and refreshed throughout the day to book our appointment. I’ve also heard of people who follow their Twitter and set their phones to get alerts about vaccine drops. Good Luck!!<br /><br />https://mobile.twitter.com/turbovax
