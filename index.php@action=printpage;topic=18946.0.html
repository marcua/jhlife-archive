				&nbsp;Are you enjoying the fabulous display of spring trees going on now? Want to make more of this experience in your own world&gt; The link below connects you to the New York Restoration Project for a free tree giveaway is open and trees are being reserved.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Check now to reserve yours for the this Sunday pickup at the JH Green Market on 79th street at Northern Blvd from 10-noon. These trees can be planted at your co-op, apt building, home, school or place of worship, plus a few other areas. Not street trees though as the city does that. Partnering here with the Jackson Heights Beautification Group or JHBG.<br /><strong><br />&nbsp;Did we mention FREE? see the list below</strong>.<br />&nbsp; <br />Here is the link:https://www.nyrp.org/green-spaces/events/tree-giveaway-with-the-jackson-heights-beautification-group<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">And here is a list of the trees that are currently available to you:[</span></strong>/u]<br /><br /><strong>SERVICEBERRY AMELANCHIER LAEVI</strong>S <br />Native Americans oftentimes used service-berries in the making of pemmican, a dried mixture of berries and fat.<br /><br /><strong>AMERICAN PLUM PRUNUS AMERICAN</strong>A <br />Growing 25 to 30 feet tall with a spread of 25 feet, Mexican Plum OR American Plum, is a North American native tree which forms an irregular canopy composed of yellow/green, shiny leaves with fuzzy undersides and thorny branches. In spring, the trees are smothered with fragrant, white blooms which are followed by purple/red, juicy fruits. These tart fruits can be used to make jams and jellies. The blooms help make Mexican Plum ideal for use as a specimen tree but it also fits in nicely in the naturalized landscape as an understory tree.<br /><br /><strong>SWEETBAY MAGNOLIA MAGNOLIA VIRGINIANA </strong><br />the first magnolia to be described by modern botanic nomenclature; the scent of the bark is reminiscent of sweetbay.<br /><br /><strong>FLOWERING DOGWOOD CORNUS FLORIDA </strong><br />The Flowering Dogwood is a small, ornamental tree reaching 20&#039;-30&#039; tall and 25&#039;-30&#039; wide, and is easy to maintain. This tree grows at a moderate rate, growing as tall as 15&#039;-20&#039; in 20 years, and reaches its mature height and width after 20-30 years. This tree requires full sun; partial sun or partial shade and well-drained soil. The fall color depends on site and seed source but most sun grown plants will be red to maroon. The white or yellow flowers turn to bright red fruits, which are often eaten by birds.<br /><strong><br />EASTERN RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS VIRGINIANA </strong><br />Juniper oil is distilled from the wood; twigs and leaves. The cones are used to flavor gin and as a kidney medicine. Native American tribes used juniper wood poles to mark out agreed tribal hunting territories. French traders named Baton Rouge; Louisiana (meaning &quot;red stick&quot;) from the reddish color of these poles. Junipers can live for more than 800 years.<br /><br /><strong>BLACKGUM NYSSA SYLVATICA</strong> <br />This species is named after a Greek water nymph, which leaves a clue as to which soil types it prefers. WET! A tree of moderate height, the black tupelo will reach an average mature height of 50 feet. Tolerates both flooding and drought, as well as most levels of sun exposure apart from full shade. This species has the most spectacular and showy fall color of a native tree and is very beneficial to wildlife.<br /><br /><strong>BALD CYPRESS TAXODIUM DISTICHUM </strong><br />the state tree of Louisiana; the bald cypress has long been prized for its ornamental bark and feathery needles.
