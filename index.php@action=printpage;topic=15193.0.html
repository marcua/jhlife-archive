				I&#039;ve lived in the neighborhood for the past 10 years and never before have I witnessed more large roaches/water bugs, than I have this year.&nbsp; :-\ They&#039;re giant roaches that fly, I&#039;ve seen them climb on the windscreen from the outside, I&#039;ve seen them in my apartment, which USED to be a rare sighting, now I&#039;m seeing them once a day at least! Despite me sealing every nook and cranny I am physically able to see. They&#039;re like water, they seep in anywhere! This hot and humid weather definitely doesn&#039;t seem to be helping. &gt;:(&nbsp; I live on 35th avenue, upper 70s. And I don&#039;t think the exterminator is helping since these things are coming from the outside.<br /><br />I guess my question is, how often do you see these huge disgusting bugs in your building or your co-op/apartment/condo? I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s just me. If anyone has been successful keeping them away, do you use bait or poison? Which brand do you recommend? I&#039;m beginning to have nightmares about these things.

				I&#039;ve lived in NYC most of my life, for the past 42 years, and my co-op is the only place that I have ever lived in where I do not see roaches or rodents.&nbsp; I actually think this is more a factor of the renovations that we did when we first moved in - my father did almost all of them, and he was very careful to seal every single crack and possible point of entry.&nbsp; Water bugs are different.&nbsp; We would find one every now and then, in the summer on hot and humid days.&nbsp; Finally we realized where they were coming from -- the drain of our master bathroom.&nbsp; The second bathroom has a cover that prevents them from climbing in.&nbsp; The master bathroom does not.&nbsp; Since we realized this, we close the drain after each shower.&nbsp; No more water bugs.

				Private house here and yes. I am seeing them too. ugh. I&#039;ve been thinking it&#039;s a combination of my neighbor prepping to move and shaking things up and the oppressive heat.&nbsp; When I do see them, most are dead or dying.

				Our building --mid-70&#039;s-has seen an increase in water bugs (aka the American Cockroach).&nbsp; We are trying to deal with it. As someone mentioned, you should make sure that they can&#039;t get in through your drains. Also, in apartment buildings they can come in under your door. <br /><br />Why the sudden increase, who knows, but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the heat is a factor.

				A few years ago I discovered the best way to deal with roaches is to mix water with a few squirts of dishwasher liquid, shaken up, in a spray bottle.&nbsp; Just a few direct squirts of this soapy mix will render even the biggest roach dead within a few seconds.&nbsp; They may freak out and scurry around but soon they are twiddling their legs often flipped onto their back shaking in the agony of their death throes. It&#039;s glorious. They just keel over and die, no more swatting, mashing, or bugguts :)<br /><br />The plus side is it&#039;s non-toxic to us humans, pets, kids etc.&nbsp; And the already soapy water makes cleanup a breeze.<br /><br />As far as keeping these demons out of your apartment to begin with, I&#039;m not sure.&nbsp; My building gets them every year.&nbsp; Strangely I&#039;ve seen LESS this year than usual.

				definitely have seen more this summer, got 4 in a two day period during the heat wave... but none since. They were also doing construction work outside so maybe that was also a factor. Hideous things!

				I live on a higher floor, so I thought I&#039;d be saved from giant cockroaches since I thought they mainly came up from the sewers in hot and wet weather and mostly affected folks on lower floors (we got the occasional giant cockroach in my old place, second floor of a two family, when it was super rainy) When I saw this thread a couple days ago, I thought to myself &quot; ha ha! never again!&quot; <br /><br />The very next day I spotted a huge cockroach in my bathroom. Not sure if it came up through the air vent or our drains. Oh my, it was big.

				We had 3 of them one weekend last month. 2 were dead when we found them, the other was dive bombing in my daughter&#039;s room. I googled like crazy and read about the drain issue. Read the suggestion of pouring bleach down the drains. Did that and haven&#039;t seen anything since.

				I&#039;m pretty sure bleach is corrosive and I wouldn&#039;t want to be pouring it down my 75 year old pipes on a regular basis (at least not if it&#039;s undiluted).&nbsp; You could probably pour boiling water down the pipes for much the same effect.&nbsp; But hey, if it stopped the roaches then maybe a one-off is all you need.

				I&#039;ve been dreading an influx but so far no different from usual. Though I&#039;m afraid saying that is going to jinx me.<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived here a few years, higher floor in a rental building. I guess I&#039;ve gotten about two a year, usually in May for some reason. Only one that flewâ€”that one totally freaked me out. Most of the others I&#039;ve seen have been dead or dying. <br /><br />I lived in a semi-basement apartment in Astoria once. If you hate/fear American cockroaches, do NOT live in a semi-basement apartment!

				Yeah, I been here over 2 yr, is always been a few that are dead and dry up. This summer is the first time I saw a big one in my room and a tiny one in the living room. Surprise is not in the kitchen, which I always keep it super clean to avoid them since all my previous apartments all have cockroaches issue that just nyc in general, there is always a bad neighbors in the building. <br /><br />I bought some traps and put around my apartment, hopefully will do the trick. I wonder if they can come to my apartment through the radiator.

				Cockroaches are where ever people are. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a matter of having a &quot;bad neighbor&quot; though if you aren&#039;t clean in the kitchen they will have more to eat. But even if you&#039;re super clean, we humans provide them lovely buildings to live inside and be heated all winter, garbage to live on, etc.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t see them regularly, the big roaches are probably coming up from your drains (from the sewer). Restaurants pour bleach down their drains for this reason.
