				I&#039;ve searched, but didn&#039;t see an earlier thread on this subject.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for a hair stylist that really understands hair. Someone who looks at your hair texture, volume, and thickness before you are sent back for a shampoo. Someone who understands you have to look at how the hair falls on a head before deciding on the type of cut to achieve the look a client wants.<br /><br />I have thick, wavy hair, and so far the hair cuts I&#039;ve gotten in the neighborhood haven&#039;t been great. I suppose if I blow dry my hair straight all the time they&#039;d be fine, but since I&#039;m more interested in wearing my hair with it&#039;s natural wave/curl, I&#039;ve ended up with cuts that don&#039;t take in to account the amount of hair on my head and its volume.<br /><br />Any recommendations in the neighborhood? I&#039;d much prefer to stay local for my hair cuts. Plus, my stylist in my old neighborhood left the salon. :(

				Curly/wavy hair is challenging for most stylists. I just pinch pennies elsewhere and go to Devachan in SoHo. They specialize in curly hair. I never leave unhappy, just much poorer.

				I will save your response in case I can&#039;t find anyone in the neighborhood. :) <br /><br />What frustrates me is that my hair is wavy, not curly, and I think the amount of hair wavy hair is something a lot of stylists haven&#039;t been trained to wrap their head around. Like, if the layers aren&#039;t done to take in to account the sheer volume of hair, it looks horrendous. I always make the point that I don&#039;t want a lot of weight, and the last two cuts I&#039;ve had involved me pointing out &quot;see how heavy this is right here? That&#039;s because my hair is thick and wavy. Can you work with the layers to take some of that out?&quot;<br /><br />My goal is not look like the lady from Dilbert.

				I would stop in to see Peter at For Your Hair. The salon is completely no frills, but he is knowledgeable. He is also candid about what cut will and won&#039;t&nbsp; work with your hair.

				I recommend Lisa at Sheer Success (37th Avenue between 84th and 85th). She is very knowledgable about hair and really takes her time to get to know your hair. She also has very curly hair herself, so she will understand from a personal perspective how certain cuts affect curly hair.<br /><br />She&#039;s also just a really lovely person and it permeates her shop - she&#039;s the owner.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pleasure to get my hair cut and colored there.

				I would go to Alberto from Shear Success,&nbsp; we have been using&nbsp; him for years. My children are both very particular and they have a lot of hair. He takes an hour working on my teenage sons hair because he prefers it long, and it&#039;s thick and wavy. My daughter has long and and alot of it. I&#039;m thinning significantly&nbsp; and he&#039;s attentive and sensitive to this fact and works with it.

				I was disappointed by for Your Hair - but I have straight hair, so maybe he is better with wavy hair.&nbsp; Anyone know of anyone for straight hair?

				I was not at all impressed with For Your Hair. I have very curly hair and the cut was just mediocre. Maybe he does females better than guys. Sorry but I&#039;ve tried a few places&nbsp; and don&#039;t have anything good to say about any of them.

				i tried a few of the neighborhood places (not yet tried Lisa at Shear Success) and was disappointed. I gave up on staying in JH and now go to Olga at Arrojo in Soho. Reasonable price for that neighborhood and the best cut I have gotten in a long time. (PS I have very curly hair and Peter at For Your Hair is a nice guy, but he insisted I should brush my hair 200 strokes a day to moisturize it. Bizarre recommendation for curly hair. I cannot even get a brush through my hair without pulling half of it out. And he wanted to blow dry my hair straight. That was fun for a couple of times, but I like my curls. I moved on.

				I have been going to Peter for two years and really like the cuts I get. I have short hair and if it isn&#039;t layered right it looks too boyish. I have seen tons on Latino and Asian women in there with long wavy hair and he does very well by them.
