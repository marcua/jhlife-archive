				My husband and I went over to the wine tasting on Saturday night at Addictive Boutique Winery, 3262 87th St (off Northern). We expected to stay only a few minutes, we ended up staying 90 minutes. This is a great place, decorated wonderfully with wooden shelves and table, very relaxed atmosphere. The owners were extremely nice and friendly. We tried four different wines from Spain and learned a lot. There were about 7 other people there and we made new friends and bought great wine. Needless to say I will be back for another wine tasting, our new weekend hangout.<br />

				Introducing LUCATONI of Chile at tonight&#039;s wine tasting.<br /><br />Dear neighbors, <br /><br />Every now and then we come across certain wines that leave us in awe. This week, we tasted a series of LUCATONI wines from Chile and became obsessed with not just the wines, but the label itself. Carlos Iglesias is our good friend and also a wine importer. After his son Luca Antonio was born last year, Carlos looked for an opportunity to dedicate a wine to his son. Carlos captured a perfect moment of Luca Antonio tipping his little toes and looking outside the window. He decided to memorialize that image onto his wine label, and name this series of wine LUCATONI. See picture below. Please join Carlos tonight as he is pouring these very personal wine. <br /><br />Pour time: 6:30 to 9:30<br />

				A shout out to the owners of additive boutique.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve bought wine here in the past, I went in for a tasting this evening and finally met with the owners. It&#039;s&nbsp; great to meet with people who are knowledgeable about the product they sell.... A very rare find in Jackson Heights indeed. They are Jackson Heights centric, which is good for us, but also informative about what they sell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had coffee and quiche in the morning&nbsp; at their place across the street and was also impressed by the help they hire.The people who they hire are a far cry from what you&#039;d expect. They are both communicative and engaging.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you Patrick and Francisco. Happy to have in in my neighborhood

				Love this place.&nbsp; The tastings are a neighborhood highlight (something I take out of towners to). And love the care in their design.&nbsp; Also am excited by the new coffeeshop.&nbsp; Only had a cappuccino, but it was good, and look forward as they expand with wine, more food, (and beer?).&nbsp; <br /><br />If the owmers are reading this (and I guess they are), i would humbly suggest some nice brunch options (or maybe healthy savory crepes?) and some nice beer selections.&nbsp; I want to hang at the new spot!&nbsp;
