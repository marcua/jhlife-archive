I am in college with some people who come from a lot of money and not new money , old money . I have seen them spit their gum on the floor various time for example and a call them out about it and their answer is &quot; oh its doesn&#039;t matter its biodegradable&quot; bunch of crap pretty much&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/shocked.gif" alt="&#58;o" title="Shocked" class="smiley" /> and I have seen people do pretty gross things in affluent places , because the snob mentally exists unfortunately ,that someone has to pick up after you . This is not always the case but, anything and everything happens in all socioeconomic classes . When it comes to other cultures , this occurs as well . Funny thing is that all of these the people of the countries you mentioned are the ones that are blamed at least in some parts of the nabe for littering , other nationalities are also at flaw big time , and natives as well . Unfortunately , some people are judged as a whole due to nationality and it sucks and is unfair for them , some rotten apples always ruin it for the rest .&nbsp; When it come to how &quot;clean&quot; these countries are , well have you noticed how picky countries like Singapore are with their littering and spiting fines , they are on top of their game to maintain this level of &quot;cleanliness&quot; with heavy fines and penalties :police: . Unfortunately this is NYC , the city is not going to hire people to control this or enforce these laws; They SHOULD , imagine the killing they would make with that kind of money :rockon: , well that would be in an ideal NYC , but we can&#039;t all have what we want , it would be awesome if it were possible. Yes, it is sad that we need the DOE fund to keep clean , it sucks there can&#039;t be more me&#039;s or you&#039;s that do not litter but, that is the REALITY of the situation one faces in a big city&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> <br />BTW , I may be young but, I have been exposed to a lot of cultures and a lot of things , but then again this is not about me , but, about JH and the problems it faces as a whole <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />

In fact this fire was a preciptating event for the creation of the JHBG.&nbsp; It is up to us to make sure our concerns and expectations are heard by our elected officials and the LPC.&nbsp; This will be a long process, and our community needs people who are committed to volunteering some of their time to get this done.&nbsp; Please contact the JHBG <a href="http://www.jhbg.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhbg.org</a> to get involved.<br />With this devastating fire, and the emptying of half of a 37th Avenue blockfront one block away (to ready it for a sale - the site of the Cavalier), it is highly likely that our historic district will be subject to some &quot;new development.&quot;&nbsp; If we are truly concerned about what potential new construction means for Jackson Heights, over the next year we will all need to do more than just talk - we need to get involved and effect positive change.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks , that really cleared up a lot . Although , sometimes I am fearful of the Landmarks Commission since so many rules are broken on a constant basis in JH especially when it comes to commercial and retail spaces . But, we all really have to come together to make sure this change is going to be a positive one indeed in the shadow of so much tragedy.

By this I mean , that it followed guidelines that did not break the rules , &quot;too much&quot; . I also know that the owner of the lot had close JH ties , which make me fearful or the owners of the current lot that burned down . What can we do to make sure all is done correctly .

I&#039;m sick and tired that JH is always getting slammed for everything , its like people have this whole stereotype in their mind that JH is some third world ghetto . Why ?&nbsp; because they see Roosevelt Ave or 82nd st and freak out. They say its shady , dangerous and dirty and judge JH as a whole. But, they don&#039;t notice that JH is pretty big and we have other main avenues and thoroughfares such as 37th, 35th , 34th, &amp; Northern Blvd and sooo on . These for the most part are very clean with the exception of 37th ave in some parts and most of our side streets are impeccable . Also, in all of the 20 years I have lived here I have never been a victim of a crime or seen one . Yes Roosevelt Ave might be shady and dirty at times , but there is more to JH than Roosevelt Ave , 74th st , or 82nd st , just as there is more than the Jackson Heights Historical District . The closed mindedness of people is ridiculous especially in those sites such as Queens Crap . They think Forest Hills is perfect , beautiful, and flawless IT&#039;S NOT ! Ever been on the corner of Continental Ave and Queens Blvd or the corridor that stretches to Austin St . OOOO boy some of the people who hang around that corner sure are shady and it&#039;s really dirty . FH might have Gap, B&amp;N, Ann Taylor, Banana Republic &amp; Eddie Bauer , but it also has sooo much crappy retail , actually a lot of bad retail that is almost or just as bad as the ones we have here . FH also does not realize that if it wasn&#039;t for Forest Hill Gardens , I highly doubt a majority of those big name retail stores would be there . FHGardens , spikes the demographics of FH as a whole , not only that but FH is huge in comparison to size and housing stock , there are huge apt buildings 20+ stories . I have thought of moving various times to FH and it does not justify at all to move there when your already living in JH . Basically take FHGardens away and the perks that it brought to FH , and there isn&#039;t much to desire in FH, it would be another Rego Park , not that there is anything wrong with Rego Park . When it comes to immigration , we are all immigrants unless YOU are a Native American . Being dirty has nothing to do with legal status , socioeconomic status , or with being an immigrant or not . In high traffic areas , especially with high foot traffic dirtiness is always an issue , be it here or in FH , or in Fifth Ave. The only way to stop it is to clean it up with the help of people like the DOE fund. Which did clean in JH for a while and let me tell you 82nd st and parts of Roosevelt were spotless , until they left&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/sad.gif" alt="&#58;&#40;" title="Sad" class="smiley" /> . So to blame any of these issues on factors like immigration is ridiculous.
