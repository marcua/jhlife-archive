				Title: <strong>Rezoning Retail Real Estate?</strong><br />

				This is proposed rezoning of retail real estate on the Upper West Side of<br />Manhattan in order to maintain mom+pop businesses (and limit banks and drug<br />stores from taking over). I wonder if something similar could be implemented in<br />Jackson Heights?<br /><br />http://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/real-estate/carters-view/city-plans-rezoning-retail-spaces-commercial-avenues-upper-west-side/45142<br /><br />

				Re-zoning for small businesses here would be so great. It&#039;s not easy to be optimistic about it, though. Everything they do here runs contrary to that idea, it seems. So many pharmacies (I use the term &quot;pharmacy&quot; loosely) in Jackson Heights -- many of which have, what, like 3 items on their shelves...? How do they survive and pay these high rents? If there is money laundering going on (if there&#039;s another explanation for this proliferation, please feel free to share any info you have) and no one is paying attention to that illegal activity, what are the chances that we&#039;ll be slotted for re-zoning? If only...sigh.

				Is it possible that the public (us?) could mount a campaign for better retail by advertising any available spaces with the rent requested by<br />the landlord posted and similar rents around the city by comparison? I find it amazing that areas so close to us geographically, like Woodside<br />and Astoria, have much more diversity in their retail environments. We have to find a way to mix this up or we will forever be on mass<br />transit with shopping bags full of purchases that would&#039;ve been made locally right here in Jackson Heights. If any realtors are available to <br />help that would be swell. There are a few places available now on 37th Avenue that could possibly be something new that the neighborhood <br />doesn&#039;t have yet...do we dare to dream?<br />

				You should contact the Seth Taylor, the new head of the 82d Street BID and let him know your concerns.&nbsp; Perhaps a sustained effort at communicating public opinion might have a productive effect for once.<br /><br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2011-12-28/Features/BID_Board_Hires_Seth_Taylor_To_Revitalize_82nd_Str.html<br /><br /><br />info@82ndstreetbid.org<br /><br />
