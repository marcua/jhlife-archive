					Maybe if an appealing restaurant (at the very least a brick oven pizza place or a better Italian place other than our single underwhelming, overpriced option, Armando&#039;s) or a craft brewery, for instance, (not drug lord-owned or on Roosevelt Ave.), or some other interesting option would open up here and then get favorably reviewed, it might attract notice and raise the desirability factor of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Since the above idealized sequence of events seems to work in a chain reaction, other interesting (artisan or craft) businesses might become attracted to our area as a result of the favorable review. This is probably wishful thinking, but it seems as though that&#039;s how revitalization has happened elsewhere. In Brooklyn, anyway. JH is home to lots of creative and smart people. Except that we&#039;re all locked in our apartments because there&#039;s nowhere interesting we can walk to and socially mix. <br /><br />The way I feel, if I have to get on a train, I may as well go into Manhattan. Lots of times I just don&#039;t feel like taking the subway, especially when it&#039;s freezing outside. It&#039;s like going to work.

					<br /><br />No, we haven&#039;t told them (I&#039;m not sure the place is still called Delhi Palace - that was the old name. We still call it that, though).

					Thanks for the heads-up about the Jackson Diner. I had no idea! I trusted it because it kind of has a reputation and is popular. I thought the JD would be more prudent regarding cleanliness based on that. Forget going there now. I do check the DOH on occasion, but to check it routinely can become a sort of full time job. I&#039;d already quit going to another Indian restaurant because of a hygienic issue (it has since closed down). Pretty sad since there are so many Indian restaurants in the neighborhood. No wonder lunch is such a bargain.

					Just an FYI...my husband got food poisoning this past week. Our doctor diagnosed it from a blood test. We narrowed it down to a lunch he had at Delhi Palace on 74th, I&#039;m sorry to say. Not long ago, they changed owners/management, as you may know. We ate there frequently when it was run by the former owners/management with no problems. Unfortunately, we don&#039;t plan to go back.<br /><br />We&#039;re 100 percent sure it came from there because we both took vacation time last week and ate the same meals together at home all week, except for one day when I had to work and he didn&#039;t. That was the day he had lunch at Delhi Palace. He got horribly sick and is finally on the mend with the help of antibiotics. We thought we should put it out there...just in case.

					I like the Indian &quot;Emporium&quot; (I forget the exact name, but the word Emporium is in the title) on 74th St (middle of block bt. 37th and Roosevelt - west side). It&#039;s really fun to browse around inside. Lots of great Indian things, espec. for the home. Very colorful.&nbsp; Proprietors are nice too.

					Many countries have legalized prostitution: <a href="http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000772</a> <br /><br />If prostitution were legalized, women could go for regular STD screenings. They would have rights. They would pay taxes and not have to turn over their wages to a pimp. They would not be brutalized daily by a pimp. These women would be afforded protection under the law if they decided to go into this profession. Arresting the johns is an idiotic solution that has proved to be ineffective. In fact, nothing the city has done in this area has worked. Of course, as you say, prostitution is a last resort for most people. However, this is not breaking news. There&#039;s a reason prostitution is called the &quot;oldest profession.&quot; It&#039;s not going away anytime soon. So why not make it legitimate.<br /><br />BTW, your snarky Miss Kitty reference was not necessary. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7823.msg45984.html#msg45984">Quote from: I live here too on October 16, 2012, 04:30:17 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Would you recommend prostitution to a daughter or son, or to a grandchild?&nbsp; Would you expose yourself to the the dangers and abuse of sex with strangers?

It&#039;s not like Miss Kitty in Gunsmoke.&nbsp; And legalizing prostitution is not going to stop sex trafficking and enslavement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					I&#039;ve lived on and off in Jackson Heights for decades. The most recent NYT article brought back memories of earlier NYT&#039;s articles I&#039;d read addressing this longterm problem of Roosevelt Ave. brothels:<br /><br />1993:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/nyregion/window-immigrant-crime-jackson-heights-drugs-dirty-money-prostitution.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/17/nyregion/window-immigrant-crime-jackson-heights-drugs-dirty-money-prostitution.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm</a><br /><br />1996:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/24/nyregion/police-arrest-70-queens-brothel-so-bold-that-employees-handed-fliers-street.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/24/nyregion/police-arrest-70-queens-brothel-so-bold-that-employees-handed-fliers-street.html</a><br /><br />1997: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/nyregion/38-men-accused-of-soliciting-sex-are-paraded-in-front-of-cameras.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/nyregion/38-men-accused-of-soliciting-sex-are-paraded-in-front-of-cameras.html</a><br /><br />The underlying problem is desperate poverty. Why not legalize prostitution? For one, it would help get rid of pimps (one of the lowest life forms on earth). <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=7823.msg45955.html#msg45955">Quote from: daisy on October 14, 2012, 11:53:52 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I do hope this article directs more attention to the problems of Roosevelt.&nbsp; I tend to avoid that avenue like the plague, even during the day.&nbsp; I too am constantly amazed at the contrasts between 34/35 aves and Roosevelt.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s like night and day.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

					I agree, it&#039;s not the most attractive supermarket in Queens. But they are trying, within their very limited square footage and high rent. I&#039;m so glad Met Foods is in the neighborhood. The manager is a nice guy and helpful. The checkers are patient, even with the most annoying (and insane) customers. I notice the manager pays attention to what regular shoppers tend to buy and then adds related products to the inventory. I appreciate that. He seems to try hard to stock healthy items on the shelves, too. I always find some new organic product or a product I would (formerly) only find in a health food store each time I shop there.

Has the neighborhood really sunk this low? Am personally <br />accepting some blame as we failed to patronize Mehfil enough. A couple months ago when we ate there for what we know <br />now was the last time, it was v.quiet on a Saturday evening. We were the only table for most of the meal although the <br />takeout business seemed brisk. It had the smell of a business on life support.

Their food is fantastic as far as I&#039;m concerned and they would<br />be missed as well.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with everything you&#039;ve written above. For a while, Mehfil was our favorite Indian food in the neighborhood (we have also switched to Dehli Palace, which we like well enough -- nice decor and music, too). The reason I stopped frequenting Mehfil? One day, when I had just finished lunch, as I waited outside closed restroom door, I heard the toilet flush and a kitchen worker came out. When I went inside the restroom, the sink wasn&#039;t even wet (did not wash his hands). There was something on the rim of the toilet that looked like residual sputum (i.e., phlegm, as if he&#039;d spit there). That did it for me.
