				I had some at Oz Cafe in Elmhurst.&nbsp; Depending on where you are in JH, it might be only about a 15 minute walk.&nbsp; Location is corner of Whitney Ave and Broadway, right around the corner from the Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House, Nusara Thai and Chao Thai.<br /><br />http://www.yelp.com/biz/oz-cafe-elmhurst

				Another vote for Oz!<br /><br />But if you&#039;re looking for a quick bubble tea fix in the 70s, try the place near the corner of 75th Street &amp; 37th Ave. (two doors to the left of Trade Fair).

				The secret to the place on 37th ave is the staff.<br /><br />There is a young woman who works there who makes, literally, the BEST CUP of TEA I&#039;ve ever had anywhere.<br /><br />There is a young man who works there who really doesn&#039;t seem to like to make tea, even though he seems to be attentive to customers with other requests.<br /><br />When I want a cup of tea, I peek inside.&nbsp; If the young woman is there, I order my tea.&nbsp; If she is not in sight, I keep walking.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the recs people!&nbsp; Quick question from a newbie:&nbsp; if I just walk up Broadway, as the numbers get smaller, will I hit Whitney Ave?<br /><br />I have walked by that weird little place on 37th, but never ventured in. It just didn&#039;t seem possible that the fax/internet place really made bubble tea, but I guess they do.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I definitely want to venture into the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s so the bakery/bubble tea place will entice me. <br /><br />

				If you walk along Broadway you will see Whitney Ave.&nbsp; Visit www.mapquest.com and enter the address 86-08 Whitney Ave, Elmhurst, NY 11373 which is the address for Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House.&nbsp; On this street is a Thai Restaurant that gets excellent reviews called Chao Thai at 8503 Whitney and a very good Indonesian Restaurant called Minangasli at 86-10 Whitney Ave.&nbsp; Three very good restaurants on one Street.&nbsp;

				Thumbs up on Vanilla Cafe, by the way. I had a very yummy black bubble tea with milk today.&nbsp; My GF tried the almond-flavored kind and found it way too sweet, so I&#039;d stick to the standard black or green. <br />The staff is very friendly and the bakery goods looked yummy, although I did not try them.&nbsp; It&#039;s a cheerful place to sit and chat. <br />I will venture out the other way and try Oz soon. Thanks again for the suggestions.

				The place on 75th and 37th is not worth it! Their &quot;bubble&quot; is so mushy and gross and they don&#039;t mix the drink at all it seems, they kind of just put some milk, water, powder and ice and let you have it. Also, the staff is quite standoff-ish and don&#039;t really care. But yeah, most times I go in there either their machine is &quot;broken&quot; or I get told they don&#039;t make it. Once I went in - I think it was like October and asked if they made bubble tea and the owner looked at me and laughed and said it&#039;s too cold, who wants bubble tea in the cold and then went off in his language to his employees (which I felt it was about me). Bottom line upfront: they are unprofessional and not worth the time or money&nbsp; :tickedoff: :2funny:<br />

				There&#039;s a new Asian bakery with bubble tea right near the 74th St. station.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Rainbow Bakery and Ice Cream.&nbsp; It&#039;s on Broadway right next to the Broadway Liquor (73-20 Broadway).<br /><br />At the moment there is a row of small flags above the entrance, probably to indicate it just opened.

				Taste the Rainbow!<br />I like this new bakery - Judi, they have egg custard tarts...I would say they&#039;re medium sized? Definitely not the big ones. My test of a good Chinese bakery is they&#039;re pineapple buns. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because I just happen to always catch them when they&#039;re freshly made, but at Rainbow, they&#039;re big and perfectly crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside! I also tried their peanut filled mochi donuts (don&#039;t know what they&#039;re really called) and it compared well to the ones my mom used to get for me when I was a kid.<br /><br />I have been also looking for a good bubble tea place - next time it&#039;s sunny I&#039;m going in for one here.
