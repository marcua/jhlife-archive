				Greetings JH Lifers,<br /><br />We&#039;re writing to announce that this website will be closing down on December 31st.<br /><br />This forum has just passed its 14th birthday.&nbsp; Our tongue-in-cheek explanation for why the site was founded has always been that the community needed more space to debate the imminent arrival of its first Starbucks (https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=9).&nbsp; The first real post on the site (https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4) was about an upcoming meeting of the Western Jackson Heights Alliance (https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/nyregion/thecity/11stre.html).&nbsp; Since then, we&#039;ve traveled together through a lot of civic activism, political flame wars, complaints about everything, excitement about new restaurants, endless announcements about flea markets.&nbsp; We&#039;ve also seen some of our active members pass away, including community leaders Betsy Guthrie (ECG), Tom Lowenhaupt (Tom Lowenhaupt), and Jose Peralta (joseperalta).&nbsp; It has also been a great place for people to reconnect: our longest active thread has been &quot;Any long time Jackson Heights residents out there? (https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=64.0)&quot;&nbsp; and we ended up creating an entire sub-board (https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?board=15.0) for people who wanted to share memories of days past in the neighborhood.<br /><br />At this point in time, it feels that there are more options than ever for discussing community issues online, and that the time for a site like this has largely faded.&nbsp; The activity level on the site is much smaller than it was at its peak, and it&#039;s a constant struggle to squash bot accounts and delete spam before it can take over the site.&nbsp; So rather than abandon it to the weeds for a declining active readership, we&#039;ve decided it is time to close up shop.<br /><br />Please use this thread to share your thoughts on JH Life, recommendations for other places for the community to congregate online, or (dare we suggest?) make arrangements to meet up in person!&nbsp; If there are threads that people found helpful for information gathering, such as contractors, plumbers, we recommend finding those now before the site shuts down.<br /><br />In celebration of our upcoming retirement, &quot;The Last Word (https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=648.0)&quot; thread&nbsp; has been unlocked and awoken from its slumber.<br /><br />Many thanks to all who have made this site possible.&nbsp; This has been a labor of love for our administrator merm, and our moderators Shelby2. toddg, Chuckster, and JHMNY.&nbsp; We are especially grateful to all of you, the participants in this experimental community, for contributing to its success and vitality over the years.&nbsp; Thank you.<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />The Jackson Heights Life Team<br />merm, Shelby2, toddg, JHMNY

				Firstly I&#039;d like to thank everyone who ran this site. It was a real service and much appreciated.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;m really sad about this and wish you would reconsider - or see if other people would be willing to run the site.<br /><br />&nbsp;Oldschool message boards are one of the few relics of the open, non-monetized, non-advertising-soaked,&nbsp; non-infowar, non-algorithm fueled,&nbsp; quirky <em>user-generated </em>internet. And they are to be lauded. <br /><br />Today&#039;s social media options DO NOT replace them; I know of no equivalents that aren&#039;t on Facebook (spits!), reddit, insta, twitter etc. <br /><br />

				Thanks JHL.<br /><br />It&#039;s been an immense learning curve on this forum. Much appreciated.<br /><br />Yes, I can see that it&#039;s probably time for far more voices to be heard...and I am aware of Facebook sites with a plethora of opinions...<br /><br />So, your hard work is much recognized with gratitude. <br /><br />Only the best to you.

				Really sorry to see this site closing down. I relied on it often for restaurant recommendations and news about the nabe.<br /><br />I agree with lalochezia that it would be great if you would reconsider or if there are others out there willing to take the <br /><br />helm. I don&#039;t know how I originally found you guys and I wonder if the reason visits are down is because people new to <br /><br />JH don&#039;t even know it exists. Anyway, thanks for all the work you put into it over the years.

				I loved this site and found many useful suggestions over the years. Many similar sites have&nbsp; already shut down because the volume on these type of sites has significantly declined.&nbsp; Although I would open the web page often I found less and less good reads.&nbsp; Also when the amount of posters dwindled the same posters would dominate the discussions and post multiple similar opinions on the same threads to get in their last word making some threads unreadable.<br /><br /><br />I&nbsp; want to express my gratitude to all those that made it happen.&nbsp; It was fun while it lasted.

				I guess people are using Next Door? This was a very useful site, but I did notice that there were very few active posters on it. There is also the JHFamilies listserv, which is quite active and useful for selling, donating, buying stuff, asking questions about vendors, or general neighborhood discussion. Thanks to the folks who created this site and ran it!

				&nbsp;To the Moderators,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for all of your work on the site over the years! It truly has been a neighborhood service. Yes, there are other algorithmic places to post locally but the uniqueness of this site has been appreciated. Sorry to hear of this closing and as some others have suggested, maybe someone/some few will come forward to keep it going. We hope so.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With appreciation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Itsit

				Oh no! I love this JH community forum so much. :(<br />This website has been a hub of opinions, questions, suggestions and recommendations for as long as I can remember. A very special bond has been created between users and I would hate for that to be lost. So...<br /><br />I am working on a new forum - Jackson Heights IRL (in real life) at: <br /><br />www.jacksonheightsirl.com <br /><br />I am trying to include all the same topics and features of this wonderful site and maybe add a few more. Please share with others so the wonderful community of Jackson Heights can continue to care and support each other online and in real life.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing you over there to continue sharing news and building a wonderful community - Jackson Heights In Real Life.<br /><br />Cheers and Happy Holidays!

				Many thanks for all the memories. I first landed here after the Starbucks buzz. Was it covered in the NYT and there was a link in the article here? This board has helped me discover many of the fine cuisines in the neighborhood.<br />

				So sorry to hear this site is closing. It really is the best option out there. There is Next Door Jackson Heights and several Facebook groups but neither has the breadth of content or as useful a structure.&nbsp;

				Sorry to hear the site is closing.<br />I beg to differ that the forum format has outlived its usefulness. If anything social media like Facebook is the reason why this has still been active, and it is not a favorable alternative after December 31st<br /><br />If you are unable to continue the domain and website it is certainly understandable and I&#039;m very grateful to have found and referred to JHL.

				If anyone is interested, please feel free to join the Jackson Heights Discord server. Discord is a chat platform. It&#039;s more akin to the chat rooms of the old days than a forum. It has &quot;servers&quot;, which are like little communities. Inside the servers are &quot;channels&quot; for different topics. For example, we have channels for &quot;general&quot;, &quot;food and drink&quot;, &quot;Meetups&quot;, &quot;parking spaces&quot;, and &quot;rooms for rent&quot;. Discord works in the browser or as a desktop/mobile app. Link to the server: https://discord.gg/YAZt4y8Uhx (https://discord.gg/YAZt4y8Uhx)
