					As long as the discussion stays civil, JHL can provide a good forum.&nbsp; Of course, there are always those who try and abuse the system.&nbsp; The most vocal Dromm supporters seem to be active on this board and out in the community, even before the campaign started to heat up.&nbsp; All the anti-Dromm nonsense seems to come from people who seemingly created accounts just to post smears.&nbsp; In a way, the lies got other people talking in a reasoned way--ALWAYS a good thing--and backfired on the original posters.

					On certain issues, the difference between Helen Sears and Danny Dromm is stark--not sure how people don&#039;t see it.<br /><br />I agree with Danny&#039;s positions, as opposed to Helen Sears&#039;s, on term limits, education, immigrant issues, LGBT rights, responsiveness to constituents, lead paint, the Bush administration&#039;s so-called War on Terror, and quality of life.&nbsp; I would be happy to take the time to go down through the issues and do a side-by-side contrast.&nbsp; Please, just ask.<br /><br />On a personal level, Danny has inspired me to get more involved in the community.&nbsp; Helen Sears has mocked or otherwise tried to belittle me in public (as I have seen her do to other constituents).<br /><br />For me and a great number of people, the choice is clear.<br /><br />As far as this election goes, the Monserrate issue is a red herring since BOTH candidates (and virtually all other party officials) supported him in a party--not public--vote.&nbsp; Things change in politics.&nbsp; At this point, Danny is running AGAINST the Democratic machine that backed Monserrate and is fighting to keep Sears in power.&nbsp; If the Queens Democratic Organization&#039;s elevation of Monserrate is so troubling to you, then why would you even think of voting for a candidate being propped up by the very same?<br /><br />

					Issues of interest to the South Asian community were discussed, including education, housing, and economic opportunity.&nbsp; Representatives from various organizations, including some young people, asked the questions.<br /><br />The differences between the candidates became clear.&nbsp; Stanley Kalathara and Helen Sears were hit especially hard on their support of the Bush administration.&nbsp; The audience was unsatisfied with Mr. Kalathara&#039;s explanation that he gave $2,000 to the Bush campaign in 2004 because, as he explained, that is what businessmen do.&nbsp; He also claimed he was unaware of who George W. Bush was.&nbsp; Council Member Sears offered no response to serious concerns about her support of the Patriot Act and the Iraq War.<br /><br />Daniel Dromm got a very warm reception from the audience and gave impressive answers on questions about immigrant rights and education.

There may be some parts of it which she didn&#039;t like. Most of the time it is more than just the title of the bill that they should decide about. So I wouldn&#039;t jump to conclusions based on a vote without hearing from the horses mouth. And if the horse doesn&#039;t speak, then you can speculate all you want. <br /><br />In regards to the original poster, you should include explanations rather than just sayings things and assuming people will accept them as fact. And it is annoying when people say &quot;look at my site for explanations.&quot; Take time out of your busy schedule and post a few sentences to give a taste of factual backup. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a question for you: Should a gay candidate make LGBT issues his first and foremost priority while in office? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re right that we have to go beyond Sears&#039;s words to ascertain why she voted the way she did.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually easy to figure out why Sears voted with the Republicans (and one Democrat) against lead paint protections.&nbsp; I am someone concerned about children&#039;s health first and foremost, and I am not one of the real estate developers who happen to be Sears&#039;s biggest contributors.&nbsp; For me, Sears has not adequately addressed why she believes nearly all of her colleagues were wrong.&nbsp; I guess she knows something we all don&#039;t and won&#039;t tell us!&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/lipsrsealed.gif" alt="&#58;-X" title="Lips sealed" class="smiley" /><br /><br />As for your question on the ranking of priorities, why does one have to rank, especially when it comes to an issue of basic human rights?&nbsp; That can get a bit divisive and exclusionary.&nbsp; I think officials who represents LGBT individuals (as all officials do) need to ensure all of their constitents live in a safe community free of discrimination.&nbsp; A candidate&#039;s experience leading the fight for one vulnerable group can be, along with other factors, a good indicator that they will be sensitive to the concerns of other groups.<br /><br />The reason I so strongly support Danny is that he is able to make those linkages.&nbsp; For example, Danny&#039;s neither Sikh nor Muslim, and there&#039;s not an overwhelmingly number of Sikh or Muslim voters in the district.&nbsp; However, Danny helped organize a screening and discussion of a film about the aftermath of 9/11 on these communities.&nbsp; This is just one of many examples of Danny reaching out.<br /><br />Having said that, the district does have special concerns for the LGBT community that Danny, I know, is keen to address.&nbsp; Danny spoke at a rally concerning an attack on a transgender person recently, which was discussed in another thread.&nbsp;

					I understand the marketplace of ideas that is created here. &nbsp;My underlying beef is not with the forum or its rules, within limits ascribed by the law. &nbsp;I don&#039;t dispute that the person posting was following the rule on anonymity. &nbsp;I, in no way, meant that you, Queenskid, are similar to this poster. &nbsp;You voice your opinion but, as far as I know, have never crossed the line.<br /><br />Having said that, I am not going to defend people like therealdromm who do cross the line. &nbsp;As much as I respect the rules while I am here, the anonymity of this forum does not guide my legal and moral compass.<br /><br />You are right, Queenskid; in the offending posting, legitimate concerns are mixed in with truly indefensible accusations. &nbsp;At this stage in society, knowing that there are people like therealdromm around, I don&#039;t support the publication of the names of victims of sexual trauma. &nbsp; I also don&#039;t support the publication of juvenile records. &nbsp;Furthermore, I will never support something that reeks of homophobia.<br /><br />This particular poster deserves to be publicized and shamed at the very least, but for now it is best to ignore this person. &nbsp;I would feel the same way if Helen Sears were sexually traumatized at 16 and someone started using that information against her in a political campaign.<br /><br />Free speech is not absolute and neither are the rules of this forum.<br /><br /><br /><br />
