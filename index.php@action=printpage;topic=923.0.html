				I have just spoken to a couple of guys about some work to be done at home. Steve Suba (646-322-1956 or 718-446-7243) seems competent and prompt (in calling back and getting here in time, unlike Antonio). Contrary to information on the local forums, he himself is not licensed but his partner is. I.e., if the job needs to be filed with the DOB etc. it will be done through his partner but a fan installation job seems to me (a non-electrician) a relatively straightforward one, and his expertise seemed to me totally adequate for a much larger project. <br /><br />I am probably going to go with another electrician, whose bid seemed to be a little better for my project, his name is Ed Seelig, completely licensed and very competent and prompt. His cell number is 516-315-9275. <br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />

				Yes, there is a big problem with Antonio showing up.<br /><br />Another licensed electrician I&#039;ve done business with is Chris McDougall (might be MacDougall). There is also a reliable company called Pastore Electric. Both have done good work for me. <br /><br />Although I gave Antonio 2 thumbs up because other family members have used him, he has never called me back or set up an appt. after I&#039;ve called and left a message.<br /><br /><br />

				As the original poster, I thought I should report on my experience.&nbsp; Called 5 electricians, three called back, and only Antonio would make a Saturday appointment.&nbsp; He was on time, was personable and did a fine job.&nbsp; I would definitely use him again and have no hesitation recommending him.

				I had the guy who did my kitchen install both my ceiling fans.&nbsp; One was pretty heavy and the ceiling needed to be braced.&nbsp; the other fan was light weight.<br /><br />He&#039;s not an electrician and he did a great job.&nbsp; I think I gave him $50.

				BRONICON ELECTRIC-(718)478-1088. Located in Woodside. The owners name is Mike and he&#039;s a licensed electrician in NYC with all insurance. Thoroughly professional and punctual!(which can be rare these days).Highly recommended.
