				If so, how was it?&nbsp; If not, it&#039;s a new restaurant on Northern Blvd between 84 &amp; 85.

				That&#039;s the former Mystic Planet, right? &nbsp;I haven&#039;t been to Rubi Rosa, but did go to Mystic Planet on one occasion. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the place was always empty. &nbsp;Is the new place doing any better?

				I went to Ruby Rosa for the first time with sister and boyfriend. Got there sometime after 8pm on Saturday. The place was totally empty so we got to sit wherever we wanted. The place is small enough to be cozy. I had been to Mystic before and I liked the decoration a lot better. But I was willing to give this place&nbsp; a chance (Full disclosure here: I went in because of the 7-10pm happy hour...2x1 Mojitos). <br /><br /><strong>The staff</strong> was very attentive (of course, there was no one else there). Within a few minutes, a couple of girls walked in and sat at another table. The service remained the same. Although the music was too loud for my taste it wasn&#039;t so bad that we couldn&#039;t hold a conversation. Before I knew it, almost all the tables were occupied. This place was full of single girls and all I could think was...do guys know this place exist? The music started getting louder at which point I asked the waitress what was going on. She told me that after 9 or so, people can get up and dance. She told me that a lot more good looking girls usually show up later at night. At which point I had to tell her I wasn&#039;t into girls and that I was very much into my boyfriend (note to self: don&#039;t let Mojitos do the talking for you.) She deadpanned with &quot;lots of hot guys show up even later tonight&quot;. We cracked up and that&#039;s basically when I allowed the Mojitos to take over and boy oh boy did we dance the night out!<br /><br />I ended up dancing with most of the single girls at that place. These girls know how to have fun! By the way...easy on the Mojitos because they are STRONG!<br /><br /><strong>The Food.</strong> I like the fact that this place only has a one page menu. My kind of place. I&#039;m very weary of places where the menu looks more like a book. This place serves food from Puerto Rico/Dominican Republic, Colombia and Ecuador. I had Chicken Mofongo (I have had this at Dominican restaurants and are to die for when prepared well.) Needlessly to say, I didn&#039;t die. The platanos were too dry. Tasty though. But dry. And the chicken was more like nuggets of chicken rather than a chicken stew smeared on top of the platanos. But I ate it because it was still good. My sister asked for grilled chicken with rice and beans. She&#039;s boring when it comes to eating. Grilled chicken?!! C&#039;on! My boyfriend went with what the waitress suggested: fried fillet of fish topped with &quot;salsita&quot; accompanied with rice and beans (ecuadorian style). THIS WAS TO DIE FOR!!! The fish was crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. It had this nice garlic, cumin and black pepper after taste. And when you eat it with the citrus in the &#039;salsita&#039; OMFG! I know what to order next time.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />What I like most about this place is how welcoming the staff was. Now, this might not mean a lot to some people, but as a gay guy who is out to have dinner with his sister and boyfriend, ending up at a place where people only look at the color of your bills, well, that means a lot to me.<br /><br /><strong>In a scale of 1 to 10:</strong><br />Food: 5 (it can go to a 10 if all I eat is fried fish fillet)<br />Drinks: 8 (Pros: good price and 2x1. Cons: too strong...too much alcohol)<br />Music: 7 (too loud at the beginning but when dancing, the sound was just perfect)<br />Service: 9 (my waitress -from Ecuador- was just too nice and friendly)<br />Fun Factor: 9&nbsp; :rockon:<br />

				Ok, so I finally got a chance to try out Ruby Rosa tonight.&nbsp; <br />Although we could see that no one else there was eating, we were willing to give it a try.<br />Instead of being greeted by a host, a large bouncer asks to look through my gym bag.&nbsp; And he went through it thoroughly.<br />But when he said he wanted to &quot;pat me down&quot; to check for weapons I decided this wasn&#039;t the place for me.<br />
