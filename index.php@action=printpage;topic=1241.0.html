				Just wanted to share something silly but new to me: CEILING FANS!!!<br /><br />Growing up here in the North, I was never really exposed to them.&nbsp; But in the past couple of years, I&#039;ve visited friends who have them in their homes and really liked sleeping with them.&nbsp; So I decided to get one for each bedroom.<br /><br />WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE THEY MAKE!&nbsp; WOW!.......<br /><br />Talk about eco-friendly, too!&nbsp; I know there will be nights where I would normally put the A.C. on low that I won&#039;t have to any more.&nbsp; And these fans were not expensive. $80 from Home Depot: Hampton Bay or Hunter.&nbsp; Quiet, no wobble... LOVE!<br /><br />Small things make me happy.&nbsp; &nbsp;:rockon:

				<strong>Every single renovation that we do where we are the designer on the job as well will include ceiling fans in every bedroom and in the Living rooms.&nbsp; They variety is so that they are not only functional but some are stunningly beutiful.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you cant find the right color for your room and want to have some fun with your new fan prime and paint the fan blades the color of your coice, this works specially well with childrens rooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here you will see the how I utilize them...sometimes I will have 2 or 3 of them in the same area or room</strong><br /><br />(http://picasion.com/pic2/c8cce4c9cd6899b20fe8cdf1eb074e92.gif)<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://picasion.com/pic2/f9655794ef6ce9e35703e5ddb398dee3.gif)</div><br /><div style="text-align: right;">(http://picasion.com/pic2/cf69cdb1d4687cd7645ca9c99a7d3bd9.gif)</div>

				Ceiling fans are a great way to conserve energy during the hot summer months, but when that wicked humidity climbs, the fan&#039;s simply not enough...as least for me.&nbsp; And I agree, they do repel those pesky mosquitoes.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I read about mosquitos and fans on Astorians.&nbsp; Since I always slept with some fan blowing and never got bitten at night, it may be true.&nbsp; I also have custom made screens on all my windows which I think helps a lot.&nbsp; And they weren&#039;t that expensive.&nbsp; Definitely worth having when it comes to bugs.

				Buddy, all our building&#039;s windows have screens, but some way or another mosquitoes find themselves into apartments on occasion.&nbsp; They probably come in from the public hallway windows and sneak into apartments when we open the doors.&nbsp; It&#039;s really not a problem, but a few do sneak in every now and then.&nbsp; That&#039;s when the ceiling fans come in handy.

				I believe&nbsp; a recent issue of Consumer Reports said that ceiling fans can make a room feel seven degrees cooler while using very little energy.&nbsp; If you set your a/c seven degrees cooler it would cost you a fortune.
