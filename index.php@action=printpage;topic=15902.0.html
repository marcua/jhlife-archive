				Just a short clip below from Wikipedia on our former State Senator when he essentially created this new &quot;group&quot; of fake Democrats.&nbsp; Make no mistake - this &quot;group&quot; is what prevented gay marriage from becoming law years earlier than it did, preventing my marriage from being recognized in this State.&nbsp; This is a personal power grab by our State Senator who, instead of siding with Democrats -- especially during this year -- has decided that he will instead side with Republicans in exchange for some additional personal power.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope he gets primaried.&nbsp; I hope he loses the primary.&nbsp; <br /><br />Begin quote:<br /><br />Monserrate then ran unopposed and on November 4, 2008, was elected the New York State Senator for the 13th district.&nbsp; Monserrate was endorsed in 2008 by the Empire State Pride Agenda, an advocacy group that supports same-sex marriage.<br />. . .<br />On June 8, 2009, Monserrate and Pedro Espada (D-Bronx) formed a coalition with the Senate Republicans.[21] The resulting 32-30 majority appointed Senator Dean Skelos (R-Rockville Centre) as Majority Leader and installed Espada as Temporary President of the Senate, replacing Senator Malcolm Smith (D-Queens).[22] A week later, the Senate Democrats appointed Senator John Sampson as their leader.[23] Monserrate responded that day by rejoining the Democratic caucus, leaving the Senate tied.[24][25] With the office of Lieutenant Governor vacant due to Eliot Spitzer&#039;s resignation, the tie could not be resolved, and the resulting legislative deadlock continued until July 9, when Espada switched back to the Democrats.[26]<br /><br />On December 2, 2009, Monserrate voted against legislation allowing same-sex marriage, which failed to pass the Senate.[27]<br />. . .

				Why can&#039;t IDC kiss republican ass when it serves them and then caucus with the&nbsp; &quot;real&quot; democrats when it doesn&#039;t? Have the IDC people signed an agreement to follow some sort of republican whip? <br /><br />To an outsider it seems like the IDC is horse-trading with republicans and democrats to achieve their goals. <br /><br /><br />

				Let me be clear. I have not joined the Republicans, I joined my fellow Democrats in the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC). I decided to join the IDC to deliver a progressive agenda for the City, because without the IDC, the State Senate would not have passed legislation that increased the minimum wage, established paid family leave and provided free UPK. <br /><br />To bring these and other progressive results to New York City, at times the IDC forms a coalition with the Republicans to allow some Republicans that can’t vote for an increase in property taxes upstate or Long Island not to vote, and in turn, the IDC gets the ability to add or push off legislation that they don’t agree with that may hurt New York City and their constituents. For communities struggling upstate, tax relief provides much-needed savings for homeowners. For a State Senator from outside New York City, a property tax cap is as essential as family paid leave is to me. This coalition makes Republicans more receptive to measures that are traditionally Democratic, and it allows us to move forward our values and initiatives. <br /><br />Unfortunately, because the mainline Democrats are in the minority they don’t have a say on what’s on the agenda. Under the Trump Administration, we either sit on our hands and shift the blame to why it couldn’t be done or we step up and try to make effective change, and turn my voice into action and results. Although this was safe to do under Obama, now it is not the time to sit on the sidelines.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I want you to be clear that I will never, never change my Democratic values, values I have been fighting all my life and values that I will never abandon. I will never, never advocate for anything that hurts my community, my district, my constituents. I will never, never accept anything that hurts immigrants and hard-working families.<br /><br />I really want to hear your concerns as I always have, and if you want me to explain further, please reach out to my office.

However, it has never been necessary to caucus with the opposing party, and to give them the benefits that accrue from strong majorities, to agree to work with them issue by issue. Working together across the aisle issue by issue is how American government has run for centuries.<br /><br />The IDC, instead, has decided to cement the Republican majority in terms of chairmanships and influence, further marginalizing other Democrats, fracturing the progressive forces in the state and making it so that Republicans, not Democrats, set the agenda in the Senate on every issue. I implore you to reconsider this decision, especially considering that the national Republican Party is currently in the process of trying to make life very difficult for the immigrant population you represent.

				Senator Peralta, many of your progressive constituents are not buying this argument.<br /><br />As others have already pointed out, caucusing with the Republicans is a completely different thing from the kind of coalition building or trading you are describing in this response.<br /><br />I am part of a lot conversations in the last few months about how to respond to the new era, and I can tell you that dealing with our local leadership is a huge part of those conversations.<br /><br />The IDC in particular has been a big topic of conversation, with discussions about trying our best to get rid of those senators. I was completely shocked and upset by the news this morning. I would have called your office, but was unable to do so during business hours. I&#039;ll be calling soon!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if we are going to succeed -- and clearly you are calculating that you are too entrenched to be challenged in a primary, but we are going to do our best.

				Senator Peralta:<br /><br />On the day, that Donald Trump unleashed his most racist and anti-immigrant agenda, you chose to announce that you are leaving the Democratic Senate (which has a numerical majority) to join a breakaway group that sits with and has empowered Republicans.<br /><br />It seems that your tone deafness and utter disregard for our values makes you unqualified to represent our community. Especially in the era of Trump, but that just goes to show you&#039;re utter disregard of our communities values. <br /><br />I have lived in Jackson Height for 45 years and supported you 3 times, but will never again support you. So I am being honest, and would like you&#039;re honest responses to my questions, since you are regularly posting a defense of your decision, and do not invite me to meet with you. Thank you.<br /><br />1) I have seen the racist anti-immigrant campaigns run by the Republican senate. Millions have been sent on TV commercials scaring voters about the Dream Act, and &quot;illegals&quot; getting to vote. The Republicans Senate has sent millions running against &quot;NYC values&quot; and we all know what that means. How could you possibly be in a &quot;coalition&quot; with people who spend millions every election cycle to spread this anti-immigramt and LGBT hate in New York State ? Do you denounce their acts and if you do, how could you be joining them in a coalition ?<br /><br />2) What exactly for our community did you extract to be part of this coalition ? I have read that people have accused you of getting extra pay (to be clear, you have categorically denied that) or some other compensation in terms of private employment (which you have not commented on.) So you are saying you received no extra compensation in the Senate, no extra discretionary government funding, no promises of outside employment, no commitment of campaign funds, NOTHING at all. Is that correct ? <br /><br />3) Either way, if you are &quot;losing&quot; money as you have made clear in you&#039;re own statements, what did you extract for our community ? How about passing GENDA ?&nbsp; How about passing the Women&#039;s Health Act which codifies Roe v. Wade in NY, because the Republican Senate has blocked it for years. In fact, they have spent millions of dollars campaigning against it. You are of course aware of that. So how are you in a coalition with the Republican Senate when they campaigned against choice and have a 100% anti-choice voting record ? My understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, but every single one of the 31 Republican Senators are anti-choice. So what exact legislation or grant did you negotiate for ?

				The Democratic party is dead, many of them just haven&#039;t realized it yet.&nbsp; They were dead long before this most recent election, that was just the tolling of the death bell.&nbsp; Over the years as they became more and more in the pocket of corporate interests, they continually voted against their own (supposed) progressive agenda. Siding with money interests against the people who vote you into power is a sure way to die a slow sure death.<br /><br />So, did Democrats view this recent election as a wake-up call??&nbsp; Are they planning ways to reform the party in order to appeal to their voter&#039;s interests and shore-up a political mandate???&nbsp; No, they&#039;re simply buttressing what they can against the opposition party, and actually doubling down with the agenda that has completely failed them.&nbsp; It&#039;s disgusting.<br /><br />What value does a political party have when the party spouts progressive ideals but works for the opposite?&nbsp; Good riddance to this burned out husk.<br /><br />If Peralta wants to work for real progressive ideas and policy he is NOT going to be able to successfully do that through this dead political party, and I think he knows it.&nbsp; Perhaps it can be done through a bi-partisan coalition... and if so then who cares what form/ label/ name is attached to the politicans who achieve these results?&nbsp; I for one am impressed a politician would make a risky political move in order to fight for progressive beliefs.&nbsp; More power to him.&nbsp; More democrats should join him.&nbsp; We need a strong independant progressive party in this country and maybe actions like this are the first step toward realizing that.

				Senator Peralta never responded to my post. I am surprised. He had such a detailed explanation in one of his posts but couldn&#039;t answer a few simple questions. Something smells here. <br /><br />There is some hidden reason behind what he is doing here, and it is going to come out, certainly in any campaign against him. <br /><br />I always gave the guy the benefit of the doubt, even though there was always an air of questionable integrity issues around the guy. The whole thing with funneling government funds to his mother and aunt, the stuff of being under federal investigation, rumors about personal issues. People always looked at him wondering if he was the next domino to fall in Albany. He may now fall but because of his alliance with the radical anti-choice, anti-woman, anti-LGBT Republican Trump loving right wing that runs the Senate.<br /><br />

				Long time reader of this forum, much longer term resident of Jackson Heights, first time poster. Jose Peralta, if you are reading this, be warned: Your days in power are numbered. You picked a very very bad time to go Machiavellian. It is quasi-Democrats like you who paved the way for our current president by rendering their base and independents cynical through self-serving ploys like this. I understand your calculus: The power you will amass in the IDC will be enough to overcome the popular backlash. In two years time, nobody in your district will remember this betrayal. Your career will coast forward on the gentle wave of ignorance, forgetfulness, and apathy. Again, your timing is very very bad. Your voters are not terribly happy right now. And I assure you that this unhappiness is not just a fad. My neighbors and I are mobilizing, against the reactionaries who now hold power, and against cynical enablers like yourself. We will not forget this.

				How ridiculous to watch Peralta send out messages that he is outraged by Trumps action at JFK. The same guy who sold out immigrants, women and the LGBT community and joined with the Republican Senate. The same republican Senate who were trump&#039;s biggest supporters in NY. Can&#039;t wait to vote against him. Already heard of three people who want to run against him, all elected officials with solid progressive records. This guy is toast.

				Peralta, read the writing on the wall: You have committed political suicide. Your political stock is now bankrupt. Your political math is atrocious. Jackson Heights is far more sophisticated than you. If you are lucky enough to land a job at the pizzeria Monseratte found himself at, we will boycott it. You will be an albatross no matter where you end up. We are tracking your every cynical move at this point. You assumed your constituency was dumber than you -- you were wrong.

				Just read this expose story below in todays NY Post. So this guy sold out Democrats, women, LGBT and immigrants because he is living the high life and has $90,000 in credit card debt. Even though he makes $100,000 annual salary with stipends. I can only imagine what shenanigans he is involved with. I am sure it will all come out, as well it should. Horrible and sad news. Another politician knee deep in the mud.<br /><br />http://nypost.com/2017/01/29/state-senator-switched-parties-because-he-needed-a-pay-raise/<br /><br />State senator switched parties because he needed a pay raise<br /><br />By Aaron Short<br /><br />State senator switched parties because he needed a pay raise<br /><br />Queens state Sen. Jose Peralta bolted from the Democratic Party because he needed a raise, sources told The Post.<br /><br />The Corona lawmaker announced Wednesday he would join the Independent Democratic Conference, which is aligned with the GOP to control the Senate.<br /><br />He didn’t publicize that he’s been making child support and college tuition payments for his children, and had between $30,000 and $90,000 in credit-card and loan debt, according to sources and public disclosures.<br /><br />“That’s a double whammy,” said one source close to Peralta. “He’s going through a lot and the lack of a raise was devastating.” Gov. Cuomo nixed a $30,500 raise for state lawmakers in December.<br /><br />Peralta’s debt has risen in the past three years, according to his 2015 state ethics filings. He owes between $20,000 and $50,000 on Citibank and AT&amp;T cards, between $5,000 and $20,000 on a car loan for a Mercedes, and his wife owes another $5,000 to $20,000 on a Discover card, records show.<br /><br />By switching his political loyalties to the IDC, he is now in line to get a new leadership position — and a stipend of up to $27,500 that comes with it. A state senator’s base pay is $79,500 per year.<br /><br />Peralta posted on Facebook that he made the move in order to “deliver a progressive agenda for the city … This coalition makes Republicans more receptive to measures that are traditionally Democratic, and it allows us to move forward our values and initiatives.”<br /><br />IDC spokeswoman Candice Giove said Democrats are “fleeing the Senate Democratic Conference because of its failed leadership, not finances.”<br /><br />She added Peralta has not received a new committee assignment and would give up his $14,500 stipend as Minority Whip on Monday.<br /><br />Senate Democrats are privately stewing over what they see as a betrayal and are already recruiting candidates to run against Peralta in a 2018 primary, sources said.<br /><br />Several other Democrats joined the eight-member IDC in recent months, including Brooklyn Sen. Jesse Hamilton, who added $7,500 to his pay with the switch by chairing the Senate banking committee.

				&quot;said one source close to Peralta&quot;<br />I understand the need for source anonymity, but really anyone could come out and say anything against anyone and as long as it makes a good story the press might run with it.<br /><br />&quot;IDC spokeswoman Candice Giove said Democrats are &#039;fleeing the Senate Democratic Conference because of its failed leadership, not finances.&#039;&quot;<br />This follows the national trend, and trends in other states, and is very likely to be true even if you don&#039;t agree with the IDC spokesperson.&nbsp; As I said before, the democratic party is in shambles and the leadership are not interested in doing what is necessary to fix it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it&#039;s increasingly frustrating for politicians that actually want to make valuable changes for their constituencies to work within such a system.

				Lets be clear.<br /><br />Peralta, on top of making $100,000 already, is going to get an extra stipend from the Senate Republicans for joining the IDC to assist in diluting the strength of the Democrats. Those member items, committee chairs and stipends are granted BY THE REPUBLICANS. You think they are giving Peralta extra money (taxpayers money BTW) because he will oppose them ?<br /><br />The Republicans help the people of Corona and Jackson Heights ? The Republicans who are 100% anti-choice, 100% anti LGBT, 100% anti-immigrant, 100% anti rent control, are looking out for us and Peralta joined them to help us ???<br /><br />The same Republicans who were Donald Trumps biggest supporters in New York State ? <br /><br />That is Peralta&#039;s strategy ? To join them and work within ? I have a bridge to sell you if you believe that.<br /><br />Peralta is sitting there laughing, because now he is making more money. To pay for whatever lavish lifestyle and personal proclivities that have put him into debt to the tune of more than $90,000 (that we know of.) He thinks the community is too stupid to do anything to him and the money interests who want to raise our rents will give him enough donations that he could trick us with fancy campaign TV ads.<br /><br />Then the Republicans turn around and make rent control and rent stabilization harder and harder to maintain every year, so OUR rents go up. So by empowering them and linning his pockets, WE pay the price in our pocketbook and wallets.<br /><br />I think he is in for a surprise if he thinks he will get away with this insult and hypocrisy.

				To those neighbors interested:<br />Senator Peralta has agreed to hold a public forum for his constituents this Friday, February 3, 6-7:30 PM at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights. Many of us have requested such a meeting so he can explain his decision to join the IDC.&nbsp; As many of us are deeply disappointed, this will be an opportunity to hear the Senator&#039;s side and to express our discontent.<br />And yes, I did just join JHLife to post this.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Senator has chosen not to publicize this event on his webpage, his Facebook, his Twitter, or via his large constituent email list, which makes many of wonder if this is a good faith effort on his part to be accountable and present to his constituency.<br />Please share widely.<br />I have voted for Peralta many times.

I can&#039;t tell you how many times we heard this guy&#039;s name.<br />* The IDC is the only thing that can stand against the Trump agenda because it now has the ability to actually stop things in the Senate, which the Democrats otherwise would not have because of ... can you guess the name?<br />* Peralta commits to rejoining the main Democratic conference if the Dems actually have more than 31 people, because Simcha Felder doesn&#039;t count.<br />* He will not vote for any legislation that would disadvantage his constituents<br />* He will do another town hall in April.<br />* p.s.

				I am a devoted liberal who hates what is happening to our country. But I also pride myself on calling it as I see it. I don&#039;t blindly latch onto a candidate just because they have a&quot;D&quot; attached to their name. The last time the Democrats controlled the state senate they voted to support as their leaders: Pedro Espada (prison); Malcolm Smith (prison); John Sampson (prison). If I was a senator who cared l would have thought about jumping ship too (of course, jumping ship back then would have led to me joining the Republican leader Dean Skelos--prison). Putting aside Peralta, people who care have to hold all their leaders accountable.<br /><br />I also have to comment on the Village Voice article that is linked to above. In it, the author reports that Jackson Heights has a &quot;burgeoning bloc of progressive, affluent Democrats&quot; who will make Peralta pay for his choice. If it is a choice between Peralta and the &quot;burgeoning bloc of progressive, affluent Democrats&quot; who think you can be a progressive gentrifier, I&#039;ll take Peralta warts and all.

				&quot;theplanesland&quot; Thanks for that exhaustive list of Peralta&#039;s responses and you&#039;re synopsis is right on the money as too Peralta&#039;s claims (none of which I think pass the smell test, I will be honest.) I think we all know the questions posed to Peralta at the event, but I too am exhausted and maybe someone else could post those. Here is my two cents in response to the Peralta list:<br /><br />1) Bullet 1 and 2 can&#039;t BOTH be true. If the Republicans are in the Majority with the infamous Simcha Felder, then why would they need the IDC votes to pass lower property taxes upstate ? If they have 32 votes without the IDC, why would they to a deal to not introduce things as a favor to the IDC ? Makes no sense. NOT TRUE<br /><br />2) The property tax cap (which limits property tax increases outside of NYC) passed overwhelmingly WITH Democratic senators support. It was Governor Cuomos initiative. Mainline Democratic Senators voted for it as well. Not just the ones in the IDC. Andrea Stewart Cousins voted FOR it. Maybe Peralta wants us to believe she is a secret IDC member. This claim Peralta is making simply never happened and will never happen. Its absurd and he knows it. NOT TRUE<br /><br />3) We can only hope Raise the Age and Dream Act passes but its not clear if #1 is true, why would the Republicans pass things they built their entire campaigns on against last year. Again, why would they do that ? Because the IDC backstabs the Democrats ?&nbsp; Watch this TV commercial Peralta&#039;s new Republican allies did last year. Its filled with anti-immigrant hate and is all about the Dream Act. They ran these commercials all over the State. But this year they will pass the Dream Act, going against their buddy Trump ? Its all just absurd double speak trying to trick his constituents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJWICLOQpMc<br /><br />4) Simcha Felder has said (he said it yesterday) he will come back if the IDC does, but that the IDC refused to come back. Okay checkmate Senator Peralta, when are you coming back to the Democratic Party ?<br /><br />5) Now the IDC will come back if they have more than 31 seats ? In 2014 after being threatened with primaries, the IDC said they were coming back no matter what. Then in 2015 they said it would take 32 seats. The number changes every year. So here is my question. In 2012 when they made the original backstab, the Democrats were in an outright majority and there was no Simcha Felder. Whats changed ? <br /><br />6) I am guessing Peralta wont vote for a &quot;bill&quot; thats against our interests, but again he is trying to trick us. Most Albany legislation gets wrapped up in omnibus bills where they hide things. <br /><br />Anyway, thats how I feel. Can&#039;t wait until the April meeting. If with 2 days notice 500 people came out, it will be thousands next time. <br /><br />Here is some free advice to Senator Peralta. Shipping in a bunch of guys in suits people to scream &quot;IDC&quot; at you&#039;re neighbors, who get to vote for/against you, does not help you. Shipping in labor people to scream at you&#039;re neighbors does not help you. If you think that you need to defend the IDC against you&#039;re own neighbors, you are doing someone else&#039;s bidding and will be thrown out of office pretty quickly.<br /><br />Peralta seems to be done at this point. I have never seen so much anger. There is no listening to his weird arguments. No amount of campaign tricks, or campaign flyers is going to convince hundreds of people who came out in the freezing cold, with 1 days notice on social media, in a&nbsp; completely organic way, to ever support him again. People came to scream at him in his face. If he is so delusional that none of this matters if 5 guys chant &quot;IDC rules&quot; at his neighbors, then its best he get out of government service anyway. <br /><br />I do not understand why he just didn&#039;t say last night &quot;You know what folks. I thought I was trying to help my community. But now I see that there are bigger issues at play and the community has spoken.

				The crowd was chanting and angry, but nobody was volatile. Maybe there was tapping on the glass, but I didn&#039;t see that (though I heard it happened). People were there with their children and it wasn&#039;t remotely dangerous. We got there at 6pm and were shut out. The place was packed and the line outside went around the block. The only people who were on his side were about ten beefy white guys with matching printed signs that the cops kept cordoned off from the rest of the crowd who were not having it.

				I did make it inside.&nbsp; The crowd outside was indeed banging loudly on the stained glass windows.&nbsp; I understand the yelling and am fine with the protesting, but I frankly found the banging on the windows disrespectful to the JCC building itself and disconcerting/volatile from inside and was hoping the cops would stop them from continuing to bang on the windows.&nbsp; They did not.&nbsp;

				<strong><em>Apparently the status quo hasn&#039;t been working.

Sounds more like, he realizes it&#039;s time to work with everyone, now that the dynamics of Washington has so severely changed. <br /><br /><br /></em></strong><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=15902.msg76111#msg76111">Quote from: thedude on February 04, 2017, 05:13:49 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;theplanesland&quot; Thanks for that exhaustive list of Peralta&#039;s responses and you&#039;re synopsis is right on the money as too Peralta&#039;s claims (none of which I think pass the smell test, I will be honest.) I think we all know the questions posed to Peralta at the event, but I too am exhausted and maybe someone else could post those. Here is my two cents in response to the Peralta list:<br /><br />1) Bullet 1 and 2 can&#039;t BOTH be true. If the Republicans are in the Majority with the infamous Simcha Felder, then why would they need the IDC votes to pass lower property taxes upstate ? If they have 32 votes without the IDC, why would they to a deal to not introduce things as a favor to the IDC ? Makes no sense. NOT TRUE<br /><br />2) The property tax cap (which limits property tax increases outside of NYC) passed overwhelmingly WITH Democratic senators support. It was Governor Cuomos initiative. Mainline Democratic Senators voted for it as well. Not just the ones in the IDC. Andrea Stewart Cousins voted FOR it. Maybe Peralta wants us to believe she is a secret IDC member. This claim Peralta is making simply never happened and will never happen. Its absurd and he knows it. NOT TRUE<br /><br />3) We can only hope Raise the Age and Dream Act passes but its not clear if #1 is true, why would the Republicans pass things they built their entire campaigns on against last year. Again, why would they do that ? Because the IDC backstabs the Democrats ?&nbsp; Watch this TV commercial Peralta&#039;s new Republican allies did last year. Its filled with anti-immigrant hate and is all about the Dream Act. They ran these commercials all over the State. But this year they will pass the Dream Act, going against their buddy Trump ? Its all just absurd double speak trying to trick his constituents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJWICLOQpMc<br /><br />4) Simcha Felder has said (he said it yesterday) he will come back if the IDC does, but that the IDC refused to come back. Okay checkmate Senator Peralta, when are you coming back to the Democratic Party ?<br /><br />5) Now the IDC will come back if they have more than 31 seats ? In 2014 after being threatened with primaries, the IDC said they were coming back no matter what. Then in 2015 they said it would take 32 seats. The number changes every year. So here is my question. In 2012 when they made the original backstab, the Democrats were in an outright majority and there was no Simcha Felder. Whats changed ? <br /><br />6) I am guessing Peralta wont vote for a &quot;bill&quot; thats against our interests, but again he is trying to trick us. Most Albany legislation gets wrapped up in omnibus bills where they hide things. <br /><br />Anyway, thats how I feel. Can&#039;t wait until the April meeting. If with 2 days notice 500 people came out, it will be thousands next time. <br /><br />Here is some free advice to Senator Peralta. Shipping in a bunch of guys in suits people to scream &quot;IDC&quot; at you&#039;re neighbors, who get to vote for/against you, does not help you. Shipping in labor people to scream at you&#039;re neighbors does not help you. If you think that you need to defend the IDC against you&#039;re own neighbors, you are doing someone else&#039;s bidding and will be thrown out of office pretty quickly.<br /><br />Peralta seems to be done at this point. I have never seen so much anger. There is no listening to his weird arguments. No amount of campaign tricks, or campaign flyers is going to convince hundreds of people who came out in the freezing cold, with 1 days notice on social media, in a&nbsp; completely organic way, to ever support him again. People came to scream at him in his face. If he is so delusional that none of this matters if 5 guys chant &quot;IDC rules&quot; at his neighbors, then its best he get out of government service anyway. <br /><br />I do not understand why he just didn&#039;t say last night &quot;You know what folks. I thought I was trying to help my community. But now I see that there are bigger issues at play and the community has spoken. I want to represent you and represent how YOU want to respond in this Trump climate. And after listening and sharing arguments and thoughts and ideas, I have decided to come back to the mainline Dems. No harm, no foul.&quot;<br /><br />Instead, he is standing there as a tool for a bunch of people screaming &quot;IDC rules&quot; all of whom clearly work for the IDC leadership (which noticeably was not there last night, leaving Peralta to hang by himself).

				Perhaps if the LGBTQ community were able to work with the Church, then perhaps President Obama would not of had to use Executive Order, a temporary order.

				In Trump era, renegade NYC Democrats’ alliance to Albany Republicans draws voter outrage<br />&nbsp;<br />BY<br />SHANT SHAHRIGIAN<br />NEW YORK DAILY NEWS<br />Sunday, February 5, 2017, 12:29 PM<br /><br />What are those New York City Democrats doing allied to the party of President Trump?<br /><br />That’s what a growing number of constituents for three state senators are wondering since the pols moved to break away from mainstream Dems and join a conference allied to majority Republicans in Albany.<br /><br />Queens voters voiced their anger on Friday night at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights, where some 200 people came to grill state Sen. Jose Peralta about his recent decision to join a group of renegades called the Independent Democratic Conference.<br /><br /><br />“Your constituents are angry. We are probably going to vote you out,” said Jenny Dubnau, 53, of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />State Senate Dems’ splinter group gains 8th member: Jose Peralta<br />Peralta held the town hall at the urging of constituents like Dubnau, an artist, who have been furious since Peralta joined the IDC on Jan. 25.<br /><br />The move came as anti-Trump protests have become a constant in the city, and many audience members accused Peralta of empowering the President’s supporters in Albany.<br /><br />“(Trump’s) going to do voter suppression and the only people who can protect our state is you guys. And you just aligned yourself with his biggest supporters,” Joan Halligan-Wang, 54, of East Elmhurst said to applause.<br /><br />Peralta insisted by having a coalition with Republicans, the IDC will be able to stop Republican efforts to help Trump policies loathed by city progressives.<br /><br />Struggling through frequent interruptions, he began the night by explaining why he decided to join the IDC in the first place.<br /><br />He pointed to the group’s work passing stricter gun control, universal pre-k for New York City and minimum wage increases, among other accomplishments, since the group allied with Republicans in 2012.<br /><br />“The only thing that I’m asking you to do is to keep an open mind,” Peralta said. “In two years, you will have an opportunity to do what you choose to. But for those two years, I ask you to keep an open mind.”<br /><br />Dozens who couldn’t get into the town hall remained outside, chanting slogans like, “No Trump! No GOP! No goddamn IDC!” A handful of people held signs in support of Peralta and the coalition.<br /><br /><br />State elections aren’t for another two years, but Queens Democratic Party leaders are already talking about finding a challenger for Peralta’s seat. Rep. Joe Crowley of Queens has increasingly voiced his anger over Peralta’s move to join the IDC.<br /><br />He railed against the senator, though not by name, at a dinner for Queens Dems last week, according to a Democratic source.<br /><br />“Crowley went really hard. (He said) this is unacceptable, especially in this era,” the source said. “We can&#039;t have Queens Dems going to the IDC and empowering Republicans, and we’re going to make that loud and clear. And that place went crazy.”<br /><br />Other new members of the eight-strong IDC are coming under pressure, too. Brooklyn state Sen. Jesse Hamilton and Upper Manhattan state Sen. Marisol Alcantara joined the group in the fall.<br /><br />One of Alcantara’s politically active constituents said she wants the senator to hold a public forum — once the voter can take a break from protests on issues like Trump’s immigration order.<br /><br />“People in our neighborhood are shocked that this could have happened,” Lynn Max, 71, of the Upper West Side said of Alcantara’s decision to join the IDC.<br /><br />Alcantara said she’s worked to answer constituents’ questions about the IDC at every opportunity.<br /><br />&quot;(Trump’s) going to do voter suppression and the only people who can protect our state is you guys. And you just aligned yourself with his biggest supporters,&quot; says Joan Halligan-Wang, 54, of East Elmhurst.<br /><br />The Latina senator said she found recent criticism of her, Hamilton, who is black, and Peralta, who is Latino, racist. The other five members of the IDC are white.<br /><br />“I think it’s like a racist statement that they are questioning the three people of color and they always bring up money,” Alcantara said in a phone interview, pointing to reports of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions she received from the IDC.<br /><br />She also echoed Peralta’s assertion that being allied to Republicans puts the IDC in a stronger position to block their efforts to support Trump.<br /><br />Republican senators recently proposed a bill requiring colleges to collect info on foreign-born students, a move Peralta plans to fight.<br /><br />“It&#039;s horrible. First thing I did was call (state Sen.) Jeff Klein and talk to my other colleagues,” she said, referencing the IDC’s leader. “We have issues in regard to immigration.”<br /><br />Trump’s presidency is giving mainstream Democrats new ammunition for their long-standing claim that the best way for the IDC’s members to reach progressive goals would be by rejoining the main conference. Republicans would still have a functioning majority by one vote.<br /><br />“Anyone that decides to prop up pro-Trump Republicans will be on the wrong side of history,” Senate Democratic spokesperson Mike Murphy said in a statement. “We need Democrats that actually care about Democratic values and not just personal or political perks,” he added, making a dig at Alcantara’s and Hamilton’s chairmanships of the labor and banks committees, respectively.<br /><br />State Sen. Diane Savino, an early member of the IDC, rejected Murphy’s criticism. But she said Peralta’s town hall showed IDC members have work to do explaining the purpose of the coalition.<br /><br />“It’s clear that we have an opportunity now to reconnect with voters in a way we can educate them more and really get them involved in things that really matter on the state level,” the Staten Island senator said.<br /><br />Albany watchers view the recent additions of Peralta and company as a sign the IDC is here to stay. That seemed fine with a number of the Friday town hall’s attendees.<br /><br />“All these people in this room don’t find a solution. Mr. Peralta is trying to find a solution,” said Julian Garfield, 51, of East Elmhurst

				Senator Peralta at a Albany press conference just called the concerned citizens of Jackson Heights and Corona &quot;agitators&quot; and &quot;outsiders.&quot; Does this man have no shame ?<br /><br /><br />IDC’s Jose Peralta accuses mainline Dems of ‘cannibalizing’ dissenters<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;By Matthew Hamilton on February 6, 2017 at 12:36 PM&nbsp; &nbsp;Albany Times Union <br /><br />Defending himself against a barrage of criticisms following a testy town hall meeting with constitutents Friday evening over his decision to join the state Senate Independent Democratic Conference, Sen. Jose Peralta is accusing mainline Senate Democrats of planting “agitators” at the meeting and of “badmouthing” and “cannibalizing” dissenters within his former conference.<br /><br />Speaking with reporters following an unrelated press conference in Albany on Monday, Peralta said he and staff counted on Friday 60 “agitators” sent “by the minority party, the minority conference, to really disrupt the meeting.” Asked how he knew they were sent by the Democrats, Peralta said there were sign-in sheets, from which out-of-district attendees could be picked out.<br /><br />“Unfortunately, that’s their tactic,” the Queens Democrat said. “One of the reasons why I left the Democratic Minority Conference is because of this badmouthing or cannibalizing of their members, some Democrats who may not agree with them. I don’t agree with that tactic. I agree about having a vision. I agree about moving forward. I need a vision to get into the majority, to pass legislation like the farmworkers bill of rights, like DREAM, like raise the age, and that’s what IDC is working for and that’s what IDC is committed to do. So, look, I had my town hall, now it’s about having a productive legislative session, and I believe I will.”<br /><br />Asked about Peralta’s “badmouthing” charges and the allegation that the Democratic conference had played any role in engineering the weekend protests, mainline leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said later Monday morning, “I reject both of those out of hand.”<br /><br />“People are paying more attention than ever before to how government works,” Stewart-Cousins said in reference to those protests and similar ones on a variety of subjects taking place across the nation. She was appearing at a press conference where the conference was rolling out proposed reforms

Didn&#039;t know you weren&#039;t suppose to do that. I wont do it again.<br /><br />I just reviewed all of the rules. I violated one of them, again, about posting things twice, &quot;spamming.&quot; I understand why that would be annoying and take away from conversation. <br /><br />That being said, I posted a newspaper article in two places with a one sentence comment. There are hundreds of people on Twitter posting the same article and are really upset. Its not like I am doing something crazy. You are the one screaming at me (I know enough to know what capitalized letters mean.) There are clear rules prohibiting calling someone a troll, screaming at them, making claims personal, etc. Not sure why I should be &quot;banned.&quot; If we are all following the rules, it seems you are the one who has violated them. Please engage in a calmer discussion with me. I find you&#039;re tone very upsetting and jarring. It makes me very nervous and I feel like you are trying to intimidate me. I have tried very hard to be measured in what I say. <br /><br />M7X7<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I ever said Peralta was &quot;lying about what he&#039;s going to do.&quot; I have never called him a liar. That wouldn&#039;t be fair. I have been posting newspaper articles for the most part and commenting on other folks posts. And no, you&#039;re question isn&#039;t stupid. In fact, I believe I have said elsewhere that I believe Peralta&#039;s voting record will not be the issue.

				Tempers are clearly hot -- but I just read through thedude&#039;s posts, and other than posting in more than place (which he is now aware he shouldn&#039;t do) I don&#039;t really understand what the problem is.<br /><br />I too was pretty upset at being labeled an outside agitator in my own neighborhood, by a guy I have voted for several times! And I (along with many people I know personally) was part of getting people to the meeting -- it was very much a neighbor-to-neighbor grassroots effort, so his accusations that it was the Party doing something nefarious is equally galling.<br /><br />And IMO, the issue is not about an individual&#039;s voting record. The issue is about control of a chamber, where the majority party decides which legislation gets voted on.

				Here is another story that just broke in the NY Times. The IDC is now saying the people opposed to them are racists. Even though the crowd I saw at the event was extremely diverse.

And by caucusing with them, the IDC has delegated that power to the Republicans. Peralta&#039;s specific, individual voting record doesn&#039;t matter so much if he never gets the chance to vote on certain legislation.<br /><br />The Democrats could have a majority if the IDC disbanded, as the morally worthless Felder has said that he&#039;ll caucus with whoever gives him the best perks. Then the Democrats would be able to determine what bills get debated and voted on.<br /><br />Now, you could say that there are already several IDC members, so Peralta&#039;s individual choice doesn&#039;t make or break the IDC. That&#039;s where we get into a debate of accommodation versus resistance. Peralta&#039;s choice to join the IDC &quot;because otherwise he would have no influence&quot; strikes a lot of people as very similar to the argument that it&#039;s pointless to protest the Trump administration, as they were elected and control the levers of power, and protesting is just pointless noise.<br /><br />However, the past few weeks have shown that isn&#039;t the case - protest works, and has caused the administration lots of trouble. And the past few years showed, with the Tea Party on the national stage in 2009, that protest works, and in fact can win big in ways that accommodation fails to do. So Peralta saying that &quot;it is worthless to be part of the group that is out of power&quot; strikes many people right now as obsolete thinking.

				Queenskid2: There were tape recordings made by federal prosecutors where former republican leader of the Senate Dean Skelos discusses what &quot;power&quot; the IDC has and why they are in a &quot;coalition&quot; with the Democrats. You could not get any better evidence.<br /><br />http://observer.com/2015/11/wiretaps-reveal-indicted-ex-senate-leaders-plans-to-beat-cuomo-and-the-democrats/<br /><br />“I heard you left a handprint on somebody’s ass,” the Skelos scion remarked, apparently referring to Bronx State Senator Jeffrey Klein, the leader of the IDC.<br /><br />But the younger Mr. Skelos chided his father when he found out Mr. Klein would retain the title of co-leader and some small legislative powers. The father reminded the son that the GOP majority was then only two seats strong, and that the Democrats would likely win a numerical majority in 2016 as they had in 2012.<br /><br />Still, he assured his boy that he would retain the title of majority leader and president of the Senate and ultimate power over all legislation and chairmanships in that house of the State Legislature.<br /><br />“I’m going to control everything,” he said. “He’s going to get very little. Believe me. Very little. Everybody’s going to know.”<br /><br />The larger point was to make sure the IDC and larger Democratic conference remain to bitter towards one another to cooperate, he said.<br /><br />“Keep them separate and fighting and hating each other,” the then-Senate leader continued. “That’s what’s worked for the last six years.<br /><br />“Keeping them at each other’s throats,” he continued.

				This is the article published by Times Union regarding Senator Peralta&#039;s efforts to offer labor protections and rights to 100,000 farmworkers in New York. Currently, farmworkers don&#039;t have a right to a day off, overtime...<br /><br />Times Union: <br />Boris Martinez typically works from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every day during the summer without a day off.<br /><br />A Long Island farmworker and native Spanish speaker, Martinez says it doesn’t matter if he’s sick or an important matter to attend to “our bosses only care that we produce for them.”<br /><br />Martinez, who appeared in Albany on Monday to share his experiences, is among those pushing for a long-stalled Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, an omnibus bill that would give farmworkers a number of labor protections. The legislation would provide, among other things, the right for farmworkers to collectively bargain, a day of rest for farmworkers, overtime pay and certain minimum wage protections.<br /><br />Though the legislation has passed the Democrat-controlled Assembly in years past, it lacks key sponsorship from Senate Majority Republicans that would signal it is ready for passage in that house of the Legislature (it hasn’t come up for a vote in previous years, either).<br /><br />The bill, now prime-sponsored by members of the Independent Democratic Conference (a band of Democrats in the Senate who have formed a majority coalition with the Republicans), comes up again in 2017 at an interesting time politically. On Monday, the national political winds swirling around immigration policy came up more than once.<br /><br />“You have a Donald Trump who’s really castigating immigrants,” state Sen. Jose Peralta, D-Queens, said. “Now is a time for us to step up and be that front line of protection.”<br /><br />Though the legislation in question is geared toward labor, the issue of migrant farmworkers being boxed out of certain state labor protections has been at the fore of the debate over this bill. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the state last year on behalf of a Spanish-speaking North Country dairy worker who claimed he was fired after attempting to organize fellow employees.<br /><br />Gov. Andrew Cuomo immediately said his administration would not defend against the suit in court. The New York Farm Bureau was granted intervenor status as the defendant in the case, and is awaiting a judge’s ruling on a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.<br /><br />In the meantime, the senators are pressing for a law because, as Peralta put it, “we don’t want any questions unanswered, and by codifying, it’s in the statute and we know there are no questions. Now we get to enforce it.”<br /><br />Farmers remain vehemently opposed to the legislation.<br /><br />Farm Credit East, a financial services provider for Northeastern farmers, issued a report in November looking at just the overtime pay implications of the legislation. It projected that farm net income would drop by 45.4 percent once a $12.50 minimum wage is fully phased-in by 2021 and if farmers are required to provide overtime pay. That equates to a 2.5 billion decline in gross farm sales, leading to a “significant” decline in agriculture sector employment statewide.<br /><br />“Particularly urban lawmakers like to speak in generalities about the hardships facing farmworkers when farmers in reality are providing them with opportunities, they’re providing them with jobs well above the minimum wage in most instances,” New York Farm Bureau spokesman Steve Ammerman said, adding that workers often are given housing and other amenities as well. “I think it’s a fallacy that farmworkers are not treated well.”

He said the 77-58 vote to approve that legislation, a relatively slim margin for an Assembly that’s overwhelmingly Democratic, “is an indication of the significant number of problems associated with the bill.<br /><br /><br />

There is now a petition circulating demanding that Peralta rejoin the Democratic caucus or step down from his seat. It currently has more than 500 signatories.<br /><br />Harris Doran, of Rise &amp; Resist, challenged Peralta&#039;s claim about protesters being outsiders. &quot;Peralta&#039;s statement about the Democratic minority party sending protestors to the town hall is false. There were a bunch of grassroots people there who have no relationship with State Democrats,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of the people who stood at the mic and spoke said they were constituents—it&#039;s on video.&quot;

				This is a piece in the Daily News regarding Senator Peralta&#039;s push to expand the state&#039;s Tuition Assistance Program to all students regardless of their immigration status. <br />-------<br /><br />Breakaway Senate Dems want undocumented immigrants to receive college financial aid in N.Y.<br /><br />ALBANY — A group of eight breakaway Senate Dems plan to make a college affordability proposal that would cover undocumented immigrants its priority in the coming state budget negotiations.<br /><br />The Senate Independent Democratic Conference would expand the state&#039;s Tuition Assistance Program to include more people regardless of immigration status.<br /><br />With budget talks soon to heat up, the IDC&#039;s newest member, Sen. Jose Peralta (D-Queens), said the conference’s college affordability plan is its &quot;number one priority.&quot; Peralta, who has long been the Senate sponsor of a bill to create a state DREAM Act, has been heavily criticized the past week for defecting from the mainline Dems.<br /><br />The original IDC plan, first detailed by the Daily News in January, sought to raise the Tuition Assistance Program’s family income eligibility limit to $200,000 a year, up from $80,000. But the IDC has since lowered the top eligibility level it is pushing to $125,000, which is in line with a plan that Gov. Cuomo proposed to make public college tuition in New York free for some families.<br /><br />The maximum TAP award under the IDC proposal would grow to $5,815, up from $5,165. The minimum TAP award would double to $1,000.<br /><br />Peralta said he hopes the fact the plan would mean more tuition help for working and middle class families that make up many of the Senate Republican districts would win GOP support even if it also covers undocumented immigrants.<br /><br />“This plan gets financial aid to those that need it,” he said. “We need to expand TAP. We need to help more students regardless of immigration status.”<br /><br />The IDC is aligned with the Senate Republicans in a leadership coalition that has come under greater attack from many in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party since the election of President Trump.<br /><br />Though the IDC points to successful efforts last year to raise the minimum wage and create a statewide paid family leave program, insiders say the breakaway conference is under pressure to deliver on a number of Democratic initiatives like the DREAM Act that Peralta has long championed.<br /><br />Senate Republicans not only oppose the idea of giving state tuition money to undocumented immigrants, they made it a big campaign issue in many districts last year.<br /><br />Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan (R-Suffolk County) reiterated his conference’s opposition to the concept on Tuesday.<br /><br />“I think the position of our members is let&#039;s make sure we are taking care of the hard working middle class taxpayers who are struggling right now,” Flanagan said. “Our conference is strongly opposed to the DREAM Act.”<br /><br />It’s unclear if that opposition would soften if rather than passing a separate DREAM Act bill, the provisions were part of a broader budget bill that included more tuition assistance for middle class families.<br /><br />Peralta and the IDC are hoping it will. Cuomo again included a call to create a state DREAM Act in his budget plan unveiled in January.<br /><br />“I believe this is going to be the year we get this done,” Peralta said.<br /><br />Senate Democratic spokesman Mike Murphy said that “for a supposed Democrat to claim a top priority is the DREAM Act while at the same time empowering Trump Republicans who have stood in the way for years and have used bigoted and offensive mailings to oppose (that) very legislation is the ultimate act of political deception and the public and advocates will see through this ploy.&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, Assemblyman Francisco Moya, a Queens Democrat who has long carried the DREAM Act bill in his chamber, said he hadn’t seen the IDC plan and couldn’t comment on it.<br /><br />But he said he’d like to see Peralta and the IDC push the DREAM Act as separate legislation.<br /><br />“They have a lead sponsor for the New York State DREAM Act as part of their conference now,” Moya said. “Let’s get it done.”

				Yes thats nice and confusing, but the story says that Republican Senate Leader Flanagan outright says they will oppose the Dream Act. You could see in the article that Assemblyman Moya smells something funny going on. <br /><br />This is all more of the same. <br /><br />So if Flanagan is 100 percent against the Dream Act, why is the IDC sitting in a caucus with them and receiving goodies like pay perks, cars, extra staff, bigger offices ? <br /><br />Is this a new strategy ? Yes, Jose Peralta supports the Dream Act. We know that. Why is he aligned with the republicans is the question ?<br /><br />

				Dude, you seem to have an obvious agenda, which is fine.&nbsp; And while I agree with much you say, I don&#039;t agree with your characterizations of Senators Klein and Savino as &quot;right wing.&quot;&nbsp; In fact, Savino&#039;s passionate and funny speech on the senate floor in support of gay marriage went viral and demonstrated the absurdity of the prohibition against gay marriage.&nbsp; And before you respond with dozens of examples of how the senate republicans are so right wing, are there any examples of Klein and Savino voting in support of right wing legislation?<br /><br />The bottom line is, even if the IDC joined the mainstream democrats, the republicans would still control the senate.&nbsp; If there comes a time when the IDC can actually swing control to the democrats, but instead chooses to still empower the republicans, then I&#039;ll be right with you in calling for their heads.&nbsp; For now, however, I think it&#039;s premature to view people as either friends or enemies.&nbsp; Just my humble opinion.&nbsp;

				There is a difference between an &quot;agenda&quot; and an &quot;opinion.&quot; Yes, I have an opinion. And yes, I post newspaper articles because I believe that backing up my &quot;opinion&quot; with independent sources make my positions more credible and put up to scrutiny.<br /><br />I think you simply do not know the history of the IDC. Here is the simple reality and this is not under any kind of dispute:<br /><br />In 2012, there were 33 out of 63 democrats elected to the NY Senate. Simcha Felder left the Democrats after the November elections and joined with the Republicans but there were still an outright majority of 32 Democrats in the Senate.<br /><br />Diane Savino then proceeded to leave the Democrats along with 3 others, and form a coalition with the right wing republicans. <br /><br />By doing so, they prevented the first African American and women, Andrea Stewart Cousins, from getting elected Majority leader of the senate. <br /><br />There were 32 Democrats elected the moment a recount was completed over a new seat in the Albany area. That was in mid-January. That seat went to a Democrat.<br /><br />Thats it. There were 32 Democrats without Simcha Felder. Thats it. There is no dispute. There was a democratic Majority and they walked away and empowered the Republicans to gain power. They left for a simple reason. The Democrats voted for Andrea Stewart Cousins as Leader and not Jeff Klein, so Klein and Savino got up and formed a coalition with the Republicans.<br /><br />Now that you have this information, do agree with me ?<br /><br />

				I will agree with you when you point out the&quot;right wing&quot; legislation that Klein and Savino have supported. I have never liked this&quot;all or nothing/if you don&#039;t walk the party line you&#039;re the enemy&quot; approach to politics. The truth is the IDC was formed against the backdrop of corruption in the Democratic leadership. The Democrats chose a criminal, John Sampson, over Klein so Klein walked. He wanted power, how shocking for a politician, but I don&#039;t see him or his colleagues as&quot;the enemy.&quot; Not yet anyway.<br /><br />With respect to your agenda/opinion argument: you have posted 59 times on this site. Approximately 55 of your posts have been about the IDC or Peralta joining the IDC. To me, that&#039;s more than a mere opinion. And that&#039;s fine. In this new age of national politics, and all the racism that&#039;s driving policy, agendas are good. Especially if they keep those in power in line.

				Actually there are many newspaper reports that the Senate Republicans are willing to pass something on this issue this year. Many of their upstate constituents are affected by this. Do not fall for the traditional IDC trap. Just like the free college tuition issue, which is the main goal of Governor Cuomo this year, this other legislation many parties have agree to do something.<br /><br />Every year the IDC come up with a list of &quot;priorities&quot; which are basically things the Governor and the Senate are pushing for or support, then they run a whole PR campaign that they alone got it accomplished. <br /><br />Once a watered down bill is passed, they tout that as a &quot;compromise victory.&quot; They did it with the minimum wage, with assault weapon ban, with marriage equality.<br /><br />Its all a PR scam to rationalize why they are getting perks, committees, extra money for staff, extra money for themselves, titles, cars with drivers, etc etc.

				crocketnyc,<br /><br />You asked &quot;Why is Senator Peralta making us think that the IDC will produce the results when the Senate Republicans would rather have our 16 and 17 year olds locked up in Rikers for certain non felony crimes and traffic and vehicular violations?&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the IDC can produce those results but the reason I want to let them try is precisely because of (many) Republicans&#039; willingness to continue this barbaric practice.&nbsp; &quot;Raise The Age&quot; has been cited by Peralta, Hamilton, Alcantera and the other&nbsp; IDC members as one of their priorities.&nbsp; There is at least a chance that if they sit at the table with the Repubs during budget talks and in other settings,&nbsp; they could find a way to get Republican acquiescence for Raise the Age, Peralta&#039;s bill to allow higher education for undocumented New Yorkers, and at least a few other critically important bills.&nbsp; I, for one, have had it with relying on an ineffectual Democratic minority that just holds press conferences and pushes for bills that won&#039;t be passed unless they can pick off at least a few Republican votes, but have shown no ability to pick off those votes.<br /><br />Maybe what Peralta is trying to do won&#039;t work.&nbsp; But, as his constituent, I want to let him try because I want the State to stop tossing teenagers into prison.<br /><br />&nbsp;And I want to try everything possible to resist Republicans who are bound and determined to be enablers of Trump&#039;s agenda.&nbsp; Given the current numbers in the Senate, in the near term, I don&#039;t see any other way to accomplish that other than the path Peralta has chosen.&nbsp;

				Here we go with the spin. It defies logic<br /><br />The college tuition is not Peralta&#039;s bill. It is the number on priority of Governor Cuomo who is negotiating for its passage with the senate Republicans. Neither Jose Peralta nor the IDC have a single thing to do with it. In fact, the Governor announced it as HIS priority BEFORE Peralta joined the IDC. <br /><br />You can&#039;t have it both ways. If the Senate Republicans have an outright majority, why would they care what Senator Peralta thinks. Why would they listen to him ? Because he is backstabbing the Democrats ? Its the same old spin. Whatever happens that is good, the IDC achieved it because the Republicans gave it to them, even though they dont need their votes. It makes absolutely no sense. <br /><br />Once again, lets hear it from the horses mouth. This is from taped conversation of federal prosecutors:<br /><br />http://buffalonews.com/2015/11/21/taped-skelos-conversation-confirms-the-rawness-of-albany-politics/<br /><br />“So, what is his, what is his title now?” Adam asked, referring to Klein.<br /><br />His father attempted to control his son’s worries.<br /><br />Coalition co-leader, a title that “means nothing,” the father said.<br /><br />“I’m going to control everything … what legislation goes to the floor … the budget. Everything,” He added.<br /><br />Adam protested. The father tried again, explaining that some GOP state senators wanted to “keep the flexibility” of having Klein close with the GOP.<br /><br />“I can’t afford a Bill Larkin having a heart attack or something,” Dean Skelos said of the 87-year-old Orange County Senate Republican.<br /><br />Adam tried to lay it out for his father.<br /><br />“Your (State Senate GOP) members don’t understand the gravity of the situation if Bill Larkin did have a heart attack. If (former Binghamton state senator) Tom Libous did die of cancer. If so-and-so decided to leave to run for another position or the private sector,” Adam implored his father. “In those situations, Jeff Klein’s response will be, ‘Well, now I’m going to go with the side who gives me the most,’ and he’s going to stick it to you. He’s going to go with the Democrats and he’s going to say (to the Democrats) ‘make me majority leader.’”<br /><br />No, the elder Skelos said, that wouldn’t happen. His son was failing to see how the GOP has kept its control, with the help of Klein, the state senator said. The mainline Democrats would never take Klein back into the fold, he insisted. “The whole idea is that you’ve got to keep them (the Democrats) separated, and that’s what this is going to do,” Dean Skelos said of the deal he was cutting with Klein. “Keep them separated and fighting and hating each other and that’s what’s worked for us for the last six years is keeping them at each other’s throats and that’s what this will do.”<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Did Cuomo&#039;s free college tuition plan include undocumented New Yorkers? I don&#039;t think so. Happy to be proven wrong but this is what I just found: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/nyregion/free-tuition-new-york-colleges-plan.html<br /><br />Peralta is pushing for inclusion of the college-age students the Repubs would love to deport.&nbsp; As I understand it, maybe it&#039;s impossible to pass the Dream Act, but this is a way to help at least some people. <br /><br />As for Skelos, Klein and the origins of the IDC...Even if every evil you assign to Klein is accurate, right now, it&#039;s an independent power base.&nbsp; The only possible way for the Dems to get a majority is for each and every one of the IDC Senators to jump back to the regular Dems, en masse.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s not going to happen. <br />&nbsp;<br />At least it&#039;s not going to happen soon. Right now, we have an emergency. It boggles my mind that, with all the possible political tasks that need to be accomplished by progressive Dems,and given that activists have limited amounts of time and resources and need to choose their battles, the person you want to fight is..Jose Peralta!! Give me a break.&nbsp; Look at his tweets and look at what he&#039;s doing for neighbors who are terrified of being arrested by ICE shock troops.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t you devote your energies to demonstrating against Simcha Felder? Or Reuben Diaz, a Senator in your wonderful Democratic Party who is anti-choice? Or Repubs in vulnerable districts?<br />

				Agree we should give this a rest and I have a life to live. But eventually I would be curious to see evidence of all the &quot;goodies&quot; and &quot;perks&quot; you say Peralta is getting. At the town hall, he indicated that the stipend he would have gotten as the Minority Whip (or something like that) was more than whatever he would or could receive from the IDC.&nbsp; Was he lying?&nbsp; <br /><br />What else does he get, other than a seat at the table, which I don&#039;t think qualifies as &quot;joining&quot; or enabling the Republicans?&nbsp; I think it is, potentially at least, a way to resist them, at least quietly.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, Sen Murphy, who is a contemptible creep,&nbsp; is pushing for a bill to force NYC to turn over municipal IDs to ICE,&nbsp; which would essentially give them more intelligence for their dragnet.&nbsp; See: http://nypost.com/2017/01/29/senate-proposes-bill-to-prevent-destruction-of-municipal-id-records/<br /><br />I am hoping the IDC will stop that dead in its tracks and you (and I) should ask them what they&#039;re doing about it.&nbsp; I suspect you and I want exactly the same outcomes. We just disagree on tactics. Be well.

				Yeah Dude. New York State politics are a cesspool, huh? It&#039;s unfortunate that a staffer for Savino did that. No argument.&nbsp; It&#039;s even more unfortunate that you made the great leap to the conclusion that it is &quot;evidence&quot; of &quot;what this IDC is all about.&quot;<br /><br />Still more unfortunate is the fact that 4 (count em!) State Senators from your lovely Democratic party voted for the anti-Sanctuary Bill last year, which removed potential protection for more than few of our neighbors in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; See: http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/parker-three-mainstream-senate-dems-vote-sanctuary-bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&quot;It passed the Senate, 36-26, on June 17 of last year as Trump was spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric in the lead-up to the presidential election. Parker and fellow Democratic Senators George Latimer (D-Westchester County), Timothy Kennedy (D-Buffalo) and Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Island) voted for the measure.&quot;<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say this is evidence of what the Democratic party is &quot;all about.&quot; I would say it is evidence that, along with some good State Senators, the party also has some conservative and/or amoral State Senators (until very recently, it had some verifiably sleazy and corrupt ones, and I wouldn&#039;t be shocked if it still had some but the corruption hasn&#039;t been verified&nbsp; yet).&nbsp; <br /><br />The only reason I point this out is that you seem to devote a lot of time and energy digging up dirt on IDC leaders and blasting it out to people on JH Life, many of whom might be unfamiliar with Albany politics. If you are looking out for the interests of people in Jackson Heights, you should spend just as much time digging up dirt on the Senate Dems,&nbsp; especially the voting records of the conservative ones, and educating us. Then let people make their own judgements about which individual politicians are more likely to be a bulwark against local Republicans who are peddling Trump&#039;s vile and dangerous garbage, and which individual politicians deserve to be confronted with rallies and protestors.

				When Peralta is removed from office you will learn that JH residents aren&#039;t dumb and wont be tricked by some kind of re-directing spin. And Peralta will learn that whoever told him it was a good idea to have IDC staffers scream at his constituents, maybe is not the best person to be listening too.

				I didn&#039;t think Peralta did a good job of communicating his rationale for the move.&nbsp; If what you say about the IDC staffers is true, that is inexcusable.&nbsp; What I saw at the town hall was that ALL of the people doing the screaming, and interrupting, were the anti-IDC people, who didn&#039;t want to hear from him and had obviously made up their minds that nothing he said was going to persuade them. Most of the people in the audience just wanted to hear his rationale and make up their minds.&nbsp; <br /><br />But the most important question right now is not the behavior of pro- and anti-IDC people. The most important question, &quot;What is the best way to give people a fighting chance to prevent Trump&#039;s agenda from being imposed on our state and city?&quot; <br /><br />Even though I wish Peralta&#039;s argument for switching to the IDC had been presented better, I&#039;ve thought about it and have been persuaded. It has nothing to do with spin. It has to do with the reality of the current configuration of the State Senate.&nbsp; The numbers are the numbers. I don&#039;t want to rehash that argument here.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, as I wrote in another thread, we have a state of emergency now. There are so many issues that progressive activists need to try to deal with, from providing sanctuary to fighting against the immigration ban to insisting that the EPA continue to protect us...(I could name many more).&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe that organizing protests against Jose Peralta or Jesse Hamilton or Marisol Alcantera, who are clearly among the most progressive State Senators, because of antipathy to their political party,&nbsp; is a productive use of political energies right now. Neither, I bet, do most of Peralta&#039;s constituents in East Elmhurst and Corona and, I believe, much of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to rally people to chase him out with &quot;pitchforks&quot;&nbsp; (you actually used that violent image!) now, of all times, I think you are not only wasting time: I think you are hurting our community.

				You have a tough (actually impossible) job, having to come up with a good argument why the IDC exists outside of personal benefits and perks.<br /><br />You are not going to be able to come up with one. Fighting Trump by joining the Republican is probably the worse argument. <br /><br />Because that of course doesn&#039;t explain why the IDC backstabbed the Democrats in 2014, preventing the Democrats from making the first woman Majority Leader of the Senate. Trump wasn&#039;t the President in 2014.<br /><br />So that is pretty much that.<br /><br />

				You&#039;re going to have a hard time convincing my neighbors that the most productive forms of &quot;resistance&quot; right now are organizing rallies against progressive legislators, when so much else needs to be done.&nbsp; That is not spin or re-direction. It is a plea for making logical choices about where to devote activist energies.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sitting at the table does not mean &quot;joining&quot; the Republicans or even &quot;enabling them.&quot; It means being in the position to block things that otherwise couldn&#039;t be blocked, and (perhaps) get things passed that otherwise wouldn&#039;t be passed. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it will work. I do know that the Democrats are in the minority in the State Senate, and while I share your hope that this will change, it is not going to change anytime soon. So, in the meantime. for example. let&#039;s see if Peralta&#039;s bill to let undocumented New Yorkers get tuition-free education goes through (and don&#039;t come back to me with the tired claim that this was actually Cuomo&#039;s bill.&nbsp; Already refuted that on another thread).<br /><br />You keep bringing up stuff that happened three-to-five years ago and dredging up history like a resentful college kid whose date didn&#039;t show up for the high school prom. I don&#039;t like some of the things Jeff Klein has done any more than you do. But the IDC exists now, and it has 3 new progressive members.&nbsp; I want to give them a chance.&nbsp; That&#039;s that.

				Oh, so now there were a &quot;thousand people&quot; outside the town hall meeting?&nbsp; Kind of a stretch, don&#039;t ya think? And, my gosh, they &quot;chased him out of Jackson Heights&quot; with &quot;pitchforks!&quot; (your earlier characterization).<br /><br />I suggest the anti-IDC folks choose which characterization of the town hall and its aftermath that they want to use.&nbsp; Originally, we were told that&nbsp; people who couldn&#039;t get in were waiting out in the cold and were understandably upset when Peralta ducked into a car and refused to speak to them. That is true of some of my friends who stood out there and I wish they&#039;d had a chance to interact with him.<br /><br />But the way you now choose to depict it, an outraged mob confronted him and ran him out of the neighborhood.&nbsp; You&#039;re actually doing him a favor, because you make it seem perfectly understandable that he would not want to stand on a sidewalk so that furious people waving signs could just scream at him and refuse to let him talk.&nbsp; Also, while some of the people who were screaming at him were, in fact, &quot;voters&quot; from our District, you can&#039;t deny that some were not. It was a mistake for him to call the protestors &quot;outside agitators&quot; because that implied there wasn&#039;t grassroots opposition from folks in our neighborhood.&nbsp; But it&#039;s also wrong to give the impression that the only people out there were &quot;voters&quot; from our District.&nbsp; There were also a good number of people from the very same #NoIDC movement you obviously represent, given the fact that you began this thread by inviting people to attend protests in other Districts throughout the City.&nbsp; Think you need to get your stories straight...

				So here we go again. <br /><br />The IDC and Jose Peralta have announced a &quot;one-house&quot; bill that includes watered down versions of all the things Democrats have been fighting for like the Dream Act. A &quot;one-house&quot; bill means the IDC introduced it, while the Republicans introduced their own budget that has no Dream Act, no Raise the Age, nothing. <br /><br />So the big &quot;seat at the table&quot; resulted in nothing but perks, privileges and pay-offs for the IDC and Jose Peralta. All that happened is the Republicans allowed them to introduce watered down bills that the Democrats would never vote for. As I have been saying, its all one big scam to enrich themselves. <br /><br />Jose Peralta and the IDC have now literally become a campaign arm of the right-wing Republicans.

				&nbsp;After an admittedly quick check, I think the new IDC budget&#039;s version of the Dream Act is not &quot;watered down.&quot; I think it&#039;s the same as it always was.&nbsp; It also includes Raise the Age and other things you&#039;ve claimed are not IDC or Peralta&#039;s priorities. What are the &quot;watered down&quot; bills the Dems won&#039;t vote for? Seriously, if there are any I would like to know.&nbsp; If anything, the Dems will be challenged because several of their Senators might not vote for the Dream Act and other things the IDC endorses. Here is a report on what&#039;s going on:<br /><br />http://www.nystateofpolitics.com/2017/03/idc-introduces-its-own-one-house-resolution/#.WMlPYNFYMa4.twitter<br /><br />Like others here, I don&#039;t mind if you have a laser-like focus on the IDC and Peralta. But I do mind that you constantly throw out unsubstantiated allegations, like the above. This is important stuff and the community needs accurate information.&nbsp; You indicated in an earlier post that when Peralta became Vice-Chair of a Committee that it was a &quot;goodie.&quot; In fact, he took a pay cut.&nbsp; When I challenged you to provide solid evidence of all the other &quot;perks&quot; and extras with which he was supposedly &quot;enriching&quot; himself (you claimed he was getting &quot;extra staff&quot; and &quot;extra office space&quot;), you didn&#039;t answer.&nbsp; (Yes,&nbsp; in a subsequent post you noted that one of his mailings was paid for by the Independence Party. But what else is there to substantiate the claim you keep making?) And yesterday you made a big deal about a Republican Senate budget that had not even been introduced because it was a snow day in Albany.&nbsp; There are a few more of these.&nbsp; I earnestly request that you be more careful in the future.

				Oh please. That&#039;s the grand strategy to save Peralta ? Challenge mainline Democrats because of a random procedural vote no one knows about ? Good luck. The people in charge over at the IDC don&#039;t really know very much, because you seem to think that Senator Peralta will somehow get re-elected by attacking other Democrats on political blogs, none of who he is running against. <br /><br />Maybe Peralta will wake up one day and realize Klein and others have sacrificed him already (I am beginning to think that was always the plan) and their fight is IDC versus Democrats, because NONE of this helps Peralta. It goes back to sending a bunch of white guys in suits to his town hall meeting to scream at his constituents &quot;IDC, IDC.&quot; He should have realized at that very moment that he was the sacrificial lamb, that he was getting played, but he didn&#039;t. <br /><br />On you&#039;re other point, I am sorry, you confuse me. Today the IDC announces its &quot;own&quot; bill, because everything I said yesterday was apparently true and the Republicans in fact put nothing in their bill that Peralta and others promised us they would. But you want &quot;evidence&quot; how I knew about it before you did ? I don&#039;t know, maybe I can just see through all these silly tricks that are killing the Jose Peralta with his constituents. Or maybe I am a secret IDC member.

				Glad to hear it. For what&#039;s it worth, I agree with you that Peralta (and the other progressive IDC Senators) are not well-served by the IDC&#039;s communications strategy of bashing and confronting Democrats in the Senate as a whole&nbsp; (as opposed to just noting that the conservative Democrats are obstacles) and attacking grassroots critics (&quot;divisive Dems, &quot;outside agitators&quot; etc. etc). Maybe that helps Jeff Klein but it is does absolutely no good for Peralta, who will need Democratic votes. Peralta would be better off if he persuaded the IDC to start showing that they want to work with the Democrats and that they share the same goals as the grassroots people who are attacking them...

So that our Senate Republicans will remember about our state rights, and that they will fight against the federal government to protect all New Yorkers. <br /><br />Our community has many vulnerable people who need friends in big places.

I noticed that Peralta didn&#039;t get a larger salary and last mailer has same exact office addresses. If he gets more money for mailers, then that means more communication to the community about what&#039;s happening in Albany. And if he does get more staff, then that means more people to help the community. <br /><br />This as a win for the community, maybe not so much for status quo party loyalty machine ... as a life long Democrat, it feels like Democrat legislators lost the zeal for the fight of advocacy. I don&#039;t see why Peralta would risk the comforts of being an incumbent that follows the party&#039;s requests, to become a target to be protested against, and vilified for something that may or may not happen. He&#039;s being vilified for something that hasn&#039;t happened yet. So are we seriously saying Peralta was better off ignoring what&#039;s happen in the community; Overcrowded schools, underfunded or lack of infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, unfair deportation/lack of representation. <br /><br />I rather we gave him a chance, untie his hands and let him go fight for us and our neighbors. Give him time before vilifying the decision, when we&#039;ve liked and agreed with his decisions before. <br /><br />Let&#039;s stop eating our own fighters with proven progressive track records. Let&#039;s focus our energy on those around the state blocking the progressive and fair policies we need up and down the state.

				&quot;Politico NY: Senate Democrats explode over one-house resolutions<br />&nbsp;<br />By NICK NIEDZWIADEK<br />&nbsp;<br />ALBANY — Tension between the state Senate&#039;s Democratic factions exploded inside the chamber on Wednesday during a debate on a non-binding budget resolution.<br />&nbsp;<br />When the Senate took up a budget resolution sponsored by the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, mainline Democrats demanded that their resolution also receive a floor vote. That led Sen. Michael Gianaris, the mainline Democrats’ second in command, to attempt several parliamentary gambits to protest his conference’s inability to put forward its own measure. They failed.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sen. Jose Peralta of Queens, whose recent defection to the IDC led to an outcry from colleagues and constituents that other IDC members labeled as “racist,” said it was the first time that he was able to vote in favor of a one-house resolution, referring to the IDC resolution.<br />&nbsp;<br />“Everyone likes to talk about progressive issues,” he said. “A vote against this is a shame.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Freshman Sen. Marisol Alcantara of Washington Heights ratcheted up tensions by accusing Gianaris of exercising “white privilege.”<br />&nbsp;<br />In addition, she said she “would like to know how many times my colleague has been called the N-word or a spic.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />Alcantara’s comments sparked multiple heated interjections from Gianaris and IDC leader Sen. Jeff Klein and forced Majority Leader John Flanagan to intervene to restore decorum.<br />&nbsp;<br />Klein defended Alcantara after the debate, saying she “takes her job, and her community and her heritage very seriously.”<br />&nbsp;<br />“This is the floor of the Senate where I think we’re supposed to be debating ideas, not personalities,” he said to reporters. “But at the end of the day, we did what we’re supposed to do, we put forth our legislative agenda.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Ultimately the IDC’s resolution drew support from only its eight members.<br />&nbsp;<br />“If there was ever any doubts who were the Republicans’ favored Democrats, this should put that to rest,” Gianaris said, speaking to reporters outside the Senate lobby.<br />&nbsp;<br />Gianaris, standing alongside the conference’s leader, Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, called the IDC’s resolution “Republican-light.”<br />&nbsp;<br />“The coalition obviously couldn’t agree on what to put in one resolution, so they allowed the IDC to put in their own resolution,” Stewart-Cousins said.<br />&nbsp;<br />Flanagan, speaking on the Senate floor, refuted accusations of opacity and exclusion by pointing to the joint budget hearings and calling it “a very public, lengthy, exhaustive process.”<br />&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size"><strong><strong>The Republican resolution passed 32-28, with <em>Democratic Sen. Simcha Felder — who caucuses with the GOP — voting alongside the 31 Republicans.</em> <strong>Both Democratic conferences</strong> voted against it.&quot;</strong></strong></span><br /><br />The mainline Democratic Conference could have voted for a progressive One House bill by the Independent Democratic Conference but instead choose to have temper tantrums, not helping progressive values. And no matter what Simcha Felder gives majority power to the Republicans. The IDC is apparently trying to bridge the gaps between party ideologies.

				This is now the third time members of the IDC have introduced race into a conversation that has nothing to do with race.<br /><br />Jose Peralta called Congressman Joe Crowley a &quot;plantation owner&quot; because he criticized him for joining with the Republicans.<br /><br />Jeff Klein called the grassroots activists &quot;racists&quot; because they protested Peralta and the Senator from Washington Heights for joining with the Republicans.<br /><br />Today, that same Senator said Mike Gianaris was exercising &quot;white privilege&quot; because he said the IDC was getting in bed with Trumps supporters and their budget was &quot;Republican lite.&quot;<br /><br />These people really have no shame at all. Its all gutter politics. Cannot wait till Peralta is removed from office if this is what he is about. Really, really disgusting behavior to try and create racial tension on politics. <br /><br /><br />

I wasn&#039;t there, but I used to be, and know how crucial negotiation and cooperation are among members. I can&#039;t say for sure, but it is possible Peralta wanted out more than he wanted in, if you get my drift. The dems are in real trouble; the left is in trouble. We may not be able to pull ourselves together by midterms. Racism and race baiting are really destructive forces.<br /><br />They are the cards that have dealt us the Trump hand.<br /><br />~Jeanette

				http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-democratic-party-urged-dump-sen-jose-peralta-article-1.3007259<br /><br />A grassroots group is working on a longshot bid to kick state Sen. Jose Peralta out of the Queens Democratic Party, saying his membership in a group of renegade Dems called the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) is thwarting progressive goals.<br /><br />Activists in Peralta’s district, centered in Jackson Heights, have been furious since he joined the IDC, which is allied to majority Republicans in the state Senate. They say the alliance is empowering Republicans to assist President Trump’s agenda on the state level, a charge they refute.<br /><br />“We want everyone to see what’s happening,” said Jackson Heights resident Susan Kang, 36, who signed a March 1 letter urging the Democratic Organization of Queens County to eject the lawmaker.<br /><br />

				VILLAGE VOICE: &quot;<strong>NY Democrat Who Put Republicans In Power Sees His Legislation Destroyed By Republicans</strong>&quot;<br />by MAX RIVLIN-NADLER - JUNE 22, 2017<br />(https://villagevoice.freetls.fastly.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2217peralta.jpg)<br /><br />In a story atypical of anywhere but Albany, New York, a local state senator who defected from his political party in order to give power to the opposition (in exchange for money and power, of course) has seen a favored bill of his killed by the same opposition he gave power to.<br /><br />Senator Jose Peralta, who represents the liberal bastions of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona, in Queens, defected to the Independent Democratic Caucus shortly after his election (as a Democrat). In doing so, Peralta helped shift the balance of power in the Senate from the Democrats (his former party) to the Republicans, a party in opposition to much of what his political platform exists of. Explaining the move at the time, Peralta said it would help him pass progressive legislation, instead of having to constantly win over the swing vote of Simcha Felder, a conservative Democrat who caucuses with Republicans. Peralta was met with stinging criticism from his constituents, who called for his resignation. His reasoning was further hobbled that by becoming a member of the IDC, Peralta would in turn enrich himself by being given bogus chairmanship money to the tune of $12,500. <br /><br />Wednesday marked the end of the legislative session in New York state, and Peralta saw one of his signature “progressive” bills, a bill to put speed cameras in school zones, defeated by the party in power, the Republicans. The Republicans had tied the speed camera legislation to mayoral control of city schools, something that Majority leader John Flanagan only wanted to renew if it meant lifting the caps on charter schools — the same charter schools whose boosters contribute gobs of cash to state Republicans. The leader of Peralta’s own breakaway group, the IDC, also rakes in lucre from those same charter school proponents.<br /><br />read more: https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/06/22/senate-democrat-who-put-republicans-in-power-sees-his-legislation-destroyed-by-republicans/<br />&nbsp;(https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/06/22/senate-democrat-who-put-republicans-in-power-sees-his-legislation-destroyed-by-republicans/)

				First, Senator Peralta has time and time again made it clear that his own move to the IDC did not shift the balance of power in the State Senate in any way. The current power sharing relationship was in place prior to Peralta&#039;s move. The fact remains that the move was the best way for Peralta to help our community, as is evidenced by the funding that he was able to provide to many groups in need throughout his District. These are just a few examples: <br /><br />http://queenstribune.com/peralta-allocates-funding-western-queens-groups/<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.qgazette.com/news/2017-06-21/Features/Project_Unveiled_To_Install_New_Air_Conditioning_a.html<br />&nbsp;<br />http://qns.com/story/2017/06/19/formerly-homeless-new-yorkers-will-now-help-clean-maintain-queens-roosevelt-avenue/<br />&nbsp;<br />Additionally, why are we now attacking Peralta for fighting for speed camera legislation in Albany? And why are we attacking him for the linkage of the legislation to the broader topic of mayoral control that lies squarely with political leaders who are not Peralta? The Governor has made it clear that the Legislature will be coming back to Albany, and coming back soon. We should be supporting the push to bring the speed camera bill across the finish line, not commiserating it&#039;s demise prematurely. Twisting these facts does nothing rather than fuel those who are trying to defeat the measure.

				Actually, that&#039;s not true. Even if the IDC decided to support the mainstream Democrats, the Republicans would still control the Senate as long as Simcha Felder caucused with them. I find the headline from the Voice article to be confusing or misleading. The Republicans controlled the Senate even before Peralta joined the IDC. I&#039;m not defending Peralta&#039;s move, but after being exposed to so many outright lies by the Republicans, who can&#039;t rely on facts to support their policies, I think that we, the good guys, should be careful to stick to the facts.

				One of the problems is that there are at least two democrats in the senate who would vote against any pro-choice legislation. I&#039;m not sure if there are any republicans who would vote to support reproductive rights, but the math is more complicated than D versus R. <br /><br />I think it is time for Governor Cuomo to visit Simcha Felder&#039;s district and put pressure on him to return to the fold.&nbsp; Once that happens, then the IDC will be out of excuses and who controls the senate will be squarely on their shoulders. Then we will see where all of the senators stand on issues like reproductive rights.

				A couple of big stories today. First this:<br />https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/nyregion/new-york-state-senate-democrats.html<br /><br />Basically, it comes down to Cuomo advocating unity but, mainly so all Democrats support him because he&#039;s finally feeling the heat from this heinous arrangement. But, it&#039;s seriously messed up to think it was that easy and they waited until after the budget passed. That&#039;s about as insulting as what Republicans at the Federal level did with the tax bill. Interesting that Crowley was in attendance at this. It all seems so mafia like. The Boss quietly there along with the labor union leaders....<br /><br />But later this surfaced:<br />https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/nyregion/stipends-state-senators-new-york-.html<br /><br />Gee, if you&#039;re not gonna pay us, why are we doing this??

They’re also, of course, the norm in Albany. They get ladled out to members of both minority and majority parties, but those in the majority get more.

				^he didn&#039;t. The Dream Act last made it to the Senate floor in 2014, when no doubt he voted for it (we could look up his voting record, but he&#039;s been a proponent of the Dream Act, so I&#039;m just assuming he did).<br /><br />I really wish those who oppose Peralta&#039;s switch to the IDC would get the facts straight. He did not caucus with the Republicans, and he did not vote for Jeff Klein to lead the senate (his switch to the IDC came shortly after the Senate leadership vote for the 2017-2018 session). What he did vote for is two Republican budgets.<br /><br />Petitioning began today for the Democratic ballot. Be sure to sign a petition for Jessica Ramos, and keep an eye on the WHOLE form if someone approaches you as part of street canvassing to make sure you are clear who you are signing to put on the ballot (registered Democrats can only sign a petition for one candidate).

				Interesting to note that while many local shops have Jessica Ramos&nbsp; and Catalina Cruz posters prominently displayed in their windows, Peralta&#039;s are all haphazardly taped outside as low to the ground as possible of random bodegas and buildings in the area.
