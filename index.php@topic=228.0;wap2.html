			Wed. night.&nbsp; Dinner for my Mom&#039;s b-day.<br />need a place not too far a walk from 76 &amp; 34th.<br />Our stalwart is Spicy Mina, but looking for something new. <br />Tried Armondo&#039;s and the Argentinian BBQ next door.<br />Looking for nice atmosphere, convivial and of course good food.<br />We could travel, but it would be nice to do something local.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

			A few people including me recommended La Fusta on another thread, but that might be too far a walk for you. (across Roosevelt Ave on 82nd St.)&nbsp; There was another steakhouse recommended on that thread as well.<br /><br />Also try chowhound for &#039;fancy and romantic&#039; in Jackson Heights here http://www.chowhound.com/topics/327162<br /><br />(I know you&#039;re not looking for romantic with your mom, but sometimes people use the word romantic to describe a place with good ambiance.)<br /><br />Have a nice celebration.

			I always enjoy Afghan Kebob House and Deshi Biryani.&nbsp; Both have good service and delicious food.

			Maybe take a car service to Pio Pio? It&#039;s got a nice lively atmosphere that&#039;s birthday perfect. And the food is always so tasty.

			It would be either a long walk or a really short subway to the following places, but would be well worth it.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Sapori Dischia 55-15 37th avenue.&nbsp; Great Italian-with lots of atmosphere in a quirky way.&nbsp; A bit on the pricy side, but really good food and wine bar as well as music on the weekends.<br /><br />2. Sripriphai 64-13 39th avenue.-&nbsp; It is considered by many to be the best thai in new york city.&nbsp; If you like Thai, this is a must try.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend the italian, it&#039;s more of a celebration type place.&nbsp;
