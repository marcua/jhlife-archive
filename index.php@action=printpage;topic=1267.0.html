				I think I&#039;ve seen pork buns in the Chinese take-out-place/bakery/bubble-tea purveyor right next to New York supermarket (or is it HK supermarket, I get them mixed up) in Elmhurst - the one with outdoor seating in the parking lot. The pork buns should be in the bakery section on the right, but I don&#039;t think they have them everyday. The vendors on the left do very limited dim sum. Watch out for the bamboo containers.<br /><br />The best dim sum is in Flushing, however. You need a high turnover for really good, fresh dimsum.

				There&#039;s East in Elmhurst with a huge selection of Dim Sum. Don&#039;t know the exact address but it&#039;s just off Queens Blvd. The best Dim Sum is in Flushing and the best I&#039;ve had there was at Jade Asian.

				My fave in Flushing is Gala Manor, on the 2nd floor of a &quot;mall.&quot;&nbsp; (It&#039;s mall in quotes because it isn&#039;t much of a mall.)<br />37-02 Main St.&nbsp; They have two entrances, one on Main St where you walk into the mall, get into an elevator, and get deposited at the restaurant.&nbsp; The other entrance is around the corner.&nbsp; They are less expensive than other places and have tastier dim sum IMHO.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about the pork buns there because they tend to be filling and I like to keep my stomach available for the maximum variety of food!&nbsp; The best pork buns in Manhattan if you&#039;re ever in Chinatown are at Chatham Restaurant.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always have to wait in a line going out the door and grab the attention of the people behind the counter.

				Jade Asian in Flushing gets my vote. I went a few weeks ago and it was the best I&#039;ve had in NYC. I definitely recommend it.

				I like Ocean Jewels in Flushing. Will have to check out Gala Manor and Jade Asian.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know too much about the dim sum scene in Flushing, regrettably. Dimsum is a communal meal and almost all my friends live in Manhattan, so I always end up going to Chinatown for dimsum even though it&#039;s not as good.

				YT28 -- It&#039;s time your friends made it out to your neck of the woods. Just let them know it takes the same amount of time for them to come to Queens as it takes for you to go to Manhattan.&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;ve been to both Jade and Ocean Jewel. They&#039;re pretty much on par with each other. Delicious and gigantic! Hmm... I might have to head out there again soon.

				Slightly off-topic.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re looking for a phenomenal, decidedly inauthentic dim sum treat, check out the &quot;Chocolate Soup Dumplings&quot; at the Rickshaw Dumpling Bar at 23rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan.&nbsp; I tried one for the first time today, and ... YUM!&nbsp; It&#039;s basically a sesame ball filled with rich melted chocolate.&nbsp; Truly decadent.&nbsp; Must have more.<br /><br />For a different (and probably more authentic) take on dessert dumplings, try the &quot;Sesame Rice Ball In Soup&quot; at Nice Green Bo in Chinatown (66 Bayard St).&nbsp; ALSO YUM!&nbsp; But not quite as YUM because it&#039;s not chocolate.

				Pings on Queens Blvd. in Elmhurst (next to the Italian Charities building) is good. haven&#039;t been in a while but it was on par with Flushing. I have Chinese friends from within the Asian community that like it.<br />Another good Dim Sum place in Flushing is Fei Da Seafood on Main street opposite the post office. East in Elmhurst isn&#039;t to bad, service is good and they have a very unique buffet section. If you are really craving those little pork buns you can buy a bag in the frozen section of any Chinese supermarket, take them home and steam them. My kids live on them. If you like the steamed bread type, the large white ones, there is a take out window in front of King 5 Noodle on Broadway in Elmhurst.&nbsp;

				Flushing Chinatown is recognized as the best New York City neighborhood for &quot;<strong>tasting the true and dazzling flavors of China.</strong>&quot;&nbsp; It&#039;s a lot more than dim sum!<br /><br />The New York Times<br />Let the Meals Begin: Finding Beijing in Flushing (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/dining/30flushing.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=39371e339e5d6b81&amp;ex=1217563200)<br />By JULIA MOSKIN<br />Published: July 30, 2008<br /><br />SEATED at a rickety table, saltshaker poised above a bowl of delicate chicken-and-ginseng soup, the young Taiwanese woman considered a question: why not use soy sauce?<br /><br />â€œSoy sauce is so American,â€ she said finally. â€œIt makes everything taste the same.â€<br /><br />Everything tastes different in Flushing, Queens, the best neighborhood in New York for tasting the true and dazzling flavors of China. The dumplings are juicier here, the noodles springier, the butter cookies flavored with a bit of salty green seaweed, as a cookie at a French bakery might be sprinkled with fleur de sel. The perfume of roasted Sichuan peppercorns and the sound of dough slapping against countertops lures visitors down to the neighborhoodâ€™s subterranean food malls, where each stall consists of little more than a stove and a specialty: slow-cooked Cantonese healing soups; fragrant, meaty Sichuanese dan dan noodles; or Fujianese wontons, no bigger than a nickel, that spread their fronds in clear broth.<br /><br />â€œI remember when you could count the number of Chinese restaurants in Flushing on one hand, and all of them were Cantonese,â€ said Tai Ma, owner of the Nan Shian Dumpling House, who has been in the restaurant business in Queens for 18 years. The number of Flushing residents born in China has doubled since 1990, according to census figures. And those immigrants have become more geographically diverse, said Pyong Gap Min, a professor of sociology at Queens College of the City University of New York.<br /><br />â€œFrom the 1970s until recently, the Taiwanese dominated Flushing, along with Koreans,â€ he said. â€œNow it is people from all over mainland China.â€ Fujian, on the southeast coast, is still the primary source of immigrants to New York, he said, but many who arrive from there actually have roots in the north, center and west of China.<br /><br />The shift means that the food of Flushing now includes dishes that donâ€™t fit many American notions of Chinese food: griddle-baked sesame bread from Chinaâ€™s large Muslim minority, potato-eggplant salad from Harbin in the northeast, Beijing-style candied fruit, and grilled lamb skewers, from Chinaâ€™s long-unreachable western frontier near Kazakhstan. There is now a mind-bending variety of noodles and dumplings: the flour foods, (mian shi in Chinese), those wheat-based staples that feed Chinaâ€™s north and west, as rice traditionally feeds the southeast. (The Yangtze River is the divider.) <br /><br />Follow link for entire article.

				I managed to drag my friends to Jade Asian in Flushing! It is fantastic and it wasn&#039;t crazy crowded, which meant that we didn&#039;t have to share the table. The dimsum was definitely of a higher quality than anywhere in Manhattan and they had lots of dishes I haven&#039;t seen in Chinatown either - including snails. Desserts were not as well done - but who cares when we can go across the street for gelato in the mall or some bubble tea at Sago.
