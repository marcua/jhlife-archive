				I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re assuming he was &quot;silenced&quot;, his last post here was December 22nd, on the restaurant&#039;s a Facebook page it was November 3rd. I don&#039;t think he was silenced on his own Facebook page.

				Considering the restaurant owner is busy creating a restaurantit&#039;s far more likely the guy is just busy. He received a lot of support on here about the troubles he was having, as well as it being a place to gripe about the challenges he was experiencing. Now that the project is moving forward, I wouldn&#039;t find it at all surprising if more time is being devoted to the actual work of opening a restaurant and less is being devoted to posting to this forum and FB/Instagram/etc.

				Oh good!&nbsp; I stand corrected.&nbsp; And it looks like it&#039;s a cajun boil.<br /><br />SWEEEET!<br /><br />London Lennies on Woodhaven Blvd does an annual crawfish boil, and while it tasted fresh, we all found it a bit on the bland side.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be better.
