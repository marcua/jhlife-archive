					Yes it would be wonderful to get one of those nicer restaurant chains in. But the next thread here titled &quot;JH is not a wealthy neighborhood&quot; or something to that effect, points out, using hard data, that JH is actually one of the poorest neighborhoods in Queens with only a small area (historic district) having a higher median income level. Which is probably why (along with mysteriously high commercial rents) these chains are not here. But I have noticed that there are many restaurants here that are not cheap, and that seem to do booming business. I am thinking of some of the South American places that feature steak, where I see many large families dining, and where prices are reasonable but not lower than prices would be in the chains mentioned. A lot of people here spend good money dining out. But the chains are probably looking at those income statistics and rejecting this area because it looks so unpromising. Is there a way around this? Someone mentioned Bed-Stuy as an area that would look similar in the stats but is beginning to attract higher income residents and the businesses that go along with them.

					Regarding the comment about the presence of the Jewish Center making this a likely neighborhood for bagels--my understanding is that there is actually only a very tiny Jewish community here, and the Jewish Center is often rented out to other religious groups for their services.&nbsp;

					I live here too: Thanks for your comment. I also posted this question on another neighborhood listserv, and yours has been the only comment that said the 90th St. station is problematic. It&#039;s not clear to me: have you moved away from that location or are you still there but you now avoid the 90th St. station? Why is that station worse than the 82nd St station? More deserted? Most commenters are saying that there are lots of people at that station even late at night, and always others getting off the train and walking towards 37th. I&#039;m just wondering why you now avoid that station.&nbsp; And does the bus come pretty often?

					A female friend is considering moving to Jackson Heights, to an apartment in the area of 35th Avenue and 88th St. She is asking me about how safe she will feel walking home from the 7 train at night to that location, and I can&#039;t really say because I live in the mid-70s and have never used that subway station. I think there is also the option of taking a bus from the Roosevelt/74 St station to that location--isn&#039;t there? Can anyone advise on this?

					Re: Ready Penny and Legends: I did not know about these places. I am pretty new to JH. Do they both serve food? If so, is the food decent? I&#039;ll have to Google to find out where they are. We had heard about an Irish bar that was supposedly famous for its burgers, located in Woodside. We tried it and found it okay, but not exceptional, and kind of far to travel. So I am glad to learn about these 2 options. One more question: do they both have loud TVs with sports on all the time? Because that kind of kills it for me.

					Do any of you have &quot;Signature&quot; service from TWC? We do, and it costs a lot more than $160. We have 2 cable boxes with DVR capability, HBO and Showtime, what they say is the highest speed internet they offer, and which they also say is only available with &quot;Signature&quot; service, and a phone. Our bill is more like $250 a month. It began around $200 a month when we started the service 3 years ago, and has gone up. We need the best possible internet because we work at home a lot, and we have felt that we had no choice but to pay this much. Now I am wondering if this &quot;Signature&quot; service is just something they made up to charge us more! I had been trying to figure out how to get Fios into our building, but that seems like a dead end. Maybe I should call TWC and say I am switching to Verizon DSL because I can&#039;t afford them anymore, and see where that gets me.

					I just checked Armondo&#039;s website and you are correct! They say they are buying Trieste and plan to open February 2015! I will miss their former location, which was on my way home from the subway and so convenient, but still this is great. I hope that once the Bruson Building is restored some good retail will go back in there--I was sad to lose those businesses but happy that the building is now being worked on.

					Excellent! I can&#039;t wait till you open--I&#039;ve been dying for something like this. I really miss Armondo&#039;s with its Italian comfort food. We enjoy the Indian, Nepalese, Tibetan, Thai, Colombian, Argentinian, Japanese and other options in JH—but sorely miss having some American/European options that are a cut above diner food. An Irish bar would be great, too. We like Plaka a lot, but it&#039;s far enough away that we just don&#039;t go there very often. Your location will be really great, and I think there is pent-up demand for what you are doing.

					We bought in JH 3 years ago after searching pretty far and wide within NYC for affordability paired with an easy commute and good quality of life/good quality apartment. We wanted 2 bedrooms and 2 baths and the only place we could find an apartment that size plus all of the above for the $400s or lower (our price range) was in JH. <br /><br />We wound up buying on the upper end of that price range, but we could have paid 100K less for an apartment only a half block from where we wound up. (We just liked the more expensive place much better for a number of reasons.) <br /><br />Still--JH really was extremely affordable. In Brooklyn to get a place that size for that price would have entailed being much farther from the subway, having just one train line, etc. The only other area that was cheaper for that size apartment was Riverdale in the Bronx. You can get a lot of space up there for a very low price. ($200s-$300s for large 2 bed/2 bath.) However, the maintenance fees were generally a lot higher in Riverdale plus the commute much harder. <br /><br />So we chose JH and are very glad we did. We did look in Montclair in a brief attempt to consider moving out of the city.&nbsp; We were warned (by someone who reluctantly left Montclair for that reason) that taxes are very high in Montclair as in a lot of N Jersey, (see comment above: 17K vs 5K in JH) and when you add up higher commuting costs, the need for one or two cars, costs for lawn maintenance, roof and water heater repairs, etc, you don&#039;t really save money by moving to Montclair. And don&#039;t kid yourself, the schools in these suburbs are not always what they are cracked up to be—I have heard from friends and colleagues. When you stay in the city, you have more choices. In the &#039;burbs you are limited to whatever is there. I have friends who hightailed it back to NYC after several years in Hastings because they found that the schools there really did not suit their kids. Another friend wound up bussing her child back to a special school in NYC every day when the Chappaqua schools could not handle her special needs. So my friend was paying those enormous taxes and not even using the schools. <br /><br />Basically you have to do a lot of research and figure out what your priorities are. If you want to pay a lot less for your apartment/house, you will probably be in a worse commuting situation. For example, we chose to pay 100K more to be 13 blocks closer to the express train than a beautiful, completely renovated apartment we also considered. To us, that was worth it. I also know people who stuck it out in their tiny Manhattan stabilized rental with 2 kids so they could go to great NYC public schools and be in walking distance. But really, bottom line, JH is still one of the more affordable areas in the city that is also very well connected via 5 subways lines. And here, there are some 1 bedrooms that really are large enough to make into 2 bedrooms. Plus maintenance fees tend to be on the low side compared to other neighborhoods. I&#039;d say you should look very hard here before giving up on finding something that works.

					Actually, DSSJH, I don&#039;t forgive the unsolicited opinion.&nbsp; The point I was making had to do with the ownership of the store. We do avoid shopping there nearly 100% of the time, and there IS a difference between spending hundreds of dollars every week (the amount we spend at Foodtown) and on occasion picking something up for 5 or 10 bucks at Global Supermarkets that we happen to need at the last minute, and that Foodtown does not carry. Sorry we&#039;re not perfect--apparently you are.

					So we&#039;ve heard that the owners of Trade Fair probably just changed the name of the place to avoid having to comply with union rules. Hence the ongoing protests. Okay so, I just noticed that a charge we made there (every once in awhile we buy one item there that we cannot get at Foodtown, otherwise we do not shop there--honest!) showed up in my bank account as a charge from Key Foods. So--it really IS owned by Key Foods now? Then why is it identified as &quot;Global Supermarkets&quot;? What the $%^#@ is going on at that place?
