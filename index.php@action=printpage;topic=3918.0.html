				Has anyone been following the story of the little boy, Anthony Maldonado that was recently murdered allegedly over a video game?&nbsp; Well, it turns out that during the police investigation at the Harlem Housing projects where this occurred, investigators came across a case of animal abuse while looking through the building&#039;s surveillance camera video tapes.&nbsp; The camera caught a guy abusing a dog while riding the elevator.&nbsp; The guy has been arrested, but I can&#039;t fathom the behavior of this person toward the animal.&nbsp; There are scenes on the video where he attacks the dog and then at the same time calls it over and pats it on the head. <br /><br />First a child dies a brutal death, and now a dog suffers.<br /><br />Warning:&nbsp; Graphic NBC Video at <strong>Gothamist:</strong> <br /><br />Video: Man Abuses Dog In Housing Project Elevator (http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/video_man_abuses_dog_in_housing_pro.php)

				The laws need to be tougher for these creeps. There is another case where the dog is clearly neglected with maggots, skin and bones and animal control want to return the dogs to their owners. I didn&#039;t watch the video above I don&#039;t want to get sick.

				According to the New York State Animal Cruelty Laws, the abuse of the dog in the video would probably classify as a Class E felony under the Aggravated Cruelty to Animals section of the law. &nbsp;That means that the maximum penalty, if convicted, would be definite confinement of maximum two years. &nbsp;But this is just my take on it, and I agree with bellabella in that laws need to be tougher.<br /><br />ASPCA - New York State Animal Cruelty Laws (http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/lobby-for-animals/state-animal-cruelty-laws/fight-animal-cruelty/lobby-for-animals/state-animal-cruelty-laws/new-york.html)

				I read about that and it was horrible, but again, the pet owner left his pet with someone who was a sociopath, just like that poor little boy was left alone with a man who had major psych. issues.&nbsp; People need to think before they leave their kids or pets with people who can&#039;t meet their needs.

				States like Colorado take animal abuse very seriously.&nbsp; There&#039;s a law that says Veterinarians must report animal abuse when they suspect it or they can get fined.&nbsp; <br /><br />All states should have tougher laws.&nbsp; Studies have shown that people who abuse/torture/kill animals usually hurt humans.<br /><br />And speaking of animal abuse in Colorado,there&#039;s a petition on fb about the a**hole who tied a rope around a sherman shepherds neck and dragged it 3 miles.&nbsp; Dog started walking, then running then dragged to death.&nbsp; Horrible, horrible.... heart breaking cruelty.

				ugh. <br />that video that shows the man kicking a tiny dog in an elevator makes me sick.&nbsp; i can&#039;t believe that anyone would do that to a dog.&nbsp; i hope that because of the media attention that he will get the maximum, and that his girlfriend, (the owner of the dog,) dumps him.

				i&#039;d prefer his girlfriend have one last encounter with him, one where a burdizzo is part of the foreplay. keep people like this from procreating and we&#039;ll get somewhere.
