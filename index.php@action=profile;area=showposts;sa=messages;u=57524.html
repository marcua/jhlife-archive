					My wife and our kids go out for dinner often.&nbsp; &nbsp;When Romeos first opened, we went there and I was so turned off that I never went back.&nbsp; We weren&#039;t that hungry, but wanted to go to the new restaurant - I think it was open for less than a week at the time.&nbsp; We did not order appetizers or desert.&nbsp; The waiter was extremely rude and treated us like we were freeloaders for not ordering appetizers/desert.&nbsp; Making matters worse, the food was not well made; the literally screwed up chicken parmesan.&nbsp; I knew when I walked out that I would never return.&nbsp; First impressions matter.&nbsp; My sense was that the wait-staff were extremely bad at their job and the kitchen staff were not true professionals based on the food and its presentation; I assumed that they were dishwashers who worked their way up.&nbsp; They probably failed the first few months because first impressions matter.&nbsp; I am sure there are others like me that took their business elsewhere - for us Uncle Peters.&nbsp; I feel terrible for the person who chose to invest in our neighborhood and has lost so much money/time/effort.&nbsp; I really wish that they would have succeeded.&nbsp; I think that whoever opens up shop there has to understand that JH has so many food options that they may not get a second chance.

					I went to the pizzeria and had a few slices.&nbsp; They were pretty good.&nbsp; I did notice that the customer garbage can was directly under the food display and adjacent to the pizza (preparation) table.&nbsp; I thought that it was pretty darn gross considering that you are placing any old garbage that ends up in the garbage can right where the food is being made and displayed.&nbsp; If you get roaches in that garbage can, they do not have to travel far.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even want to think about rodents.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please rearrange the garbage can location so that it is not so close to the food that is being prepared and/or sold. <br /><br />In any case, good luck!

					I wanted to follow up on this post.&nbsp; I ended up using Adler Windows to replace my windows.&nbsp; They obtained the proper paperwork from the Landmarks Commission.&nbsp; We had a few hiccups, but I would definitely recommend this company.&nbsp; To elaborate further, some of the windows were not a perfect fit and Adler Windows had them remade; I brought this to the attention of Adler Windows.&nbsp; There are a lot of vendors that would have stuck me with the windows because the measurements were slightly off and the moldings would have covered them.&nbsp; On the other hand, I hired a top rated company and they wanted to ensure that I was completely satisfied.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are a few tips I would like to share:<br /><br />1) make sure that you get a picture and model number of the window that is being installed<br />2) make sure that the window specifications are in the work order, e.g., vent locks, color of hardware, painted, primed, unpainted, etc.<br />3) have somebody take the measurements independently from the window vendor and compare the measurements<br />4) on installation day, take the time to cover your floors and if you can put padding around the area where the workers will be working - you want to avoid scratches and dings on the floors <br />5) after installation, check each window&#039;s hardware to make sure that they open and close easily and that the window can be disengaged/re-engaged for cleaning the outside panes while the workers are still present<br />6) if they are installing window handles, have them measure the exact place where they are drilling to ensure consistency throughout all the windows<br /><br /><br />

A person who lives on the street, who is dirty as Fu..K, stinks to high heaven, and stares down people who are walking down the street, are just nuts.&nbsp; You are a raging liberal (I am pretty darn liberal myself)!!!!&nbsp; You must be the dumbest NYer ever.&nbsp; My guess is that you are not a life long New Yorker.&nbsp; I am guessing that you moved here and view yourself as the Mother Theresa of the homeless population.&nbsp; For your information tourist, this is a population that has problems when they are living on the streets, stinking up the entire neighborhood, making people who pay taxes, own homes worth almost a million dollars (that&#039;s what it costs to live in the Hawthorne Court), and have to walk around with children who under the age of 6, feel uncomfortable in their own neighborhoods. From my perspective, it is far more humane to get these people the help they need so that they don&#039;t end up living on the streets, stinking up the entire block that they choose to be in, and bothering tax paying, home owning, citizens.&nbsp; There are tons of cases where this population (mentally ill people who are unable to care for themselves and are not provided the medical care that they need) end up hurting innocent people.&nbsp; They violently assault people.&nbsp; On that note, I feel really bad for the victims of crimes committed by mentally ill homeless people:<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Homeless-Man-Accused-of-Attempted-Rape-of-NYC-Shelter-Security-Guard--506219261.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Homeless-Man-Accused-of-Attempted-Rape-of-NYC-Shelter-Security-Guard--506219261.html</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rape-Queens-78-Year-Old-Woman-510752991.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Rape-Queens-78-Year-Old-Woman-510752991.html</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-man-who-allegedly-knocked-out-73-year-old-womans-teeth-during-rape-attempt-arrested-police" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-man-who-allegedly-knocked-out-73-year-old-womans-teeth-during-rape-attempt-arrested-police</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/disturbed-homeless-man-busted-for-attempted-rape-on-mta-bus-cops/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/disturbed-homeless-man-busted-for-attempted-rape-on-mta-bus-cops/</a><br /><br /><a href="https://pix11.com/2018/12/26/homeless-men-face-charges-for-fighting-nypd-officer/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://pix11.com/2018/12/26/homeless-men-face-charges-for-fighting-nypd-officer/</a><br /><br />You choose to attack people who raise legitimate concerns about this population and the safety of our community.&nbsp; On that note, you are a complete and total jerk.&nbsp; &nbsp;In closing, one does not have to be an expert to see that someone is mentally ill based on the circumstances that are evident, e.g., super dirty, living on the streets, super smelly, destroying property, staring people down (if you are a New Yorker you know what this means, I am guessing you are not a New Yorker - thanks for visiting), and being a nuisance to the entire community. I bet you have never invited one of these people to your home or to socialize with you, yet you put the rest of us down for being concerned for them and our own safety.&nbsp; That makes you a hypocrite.&nbsp; Again, thanks for visiting New York.&nbsp; When are you going back home - we can&#039;t wait for that to happen. <br /><br />

					AOC is the worst thing to happen to this neighborhood.&nbsp; The audacity of supporting Caban was enough for me to never support her in any way.&nbsp; I will never vote for her again.&nbsp; In fact, I would vote for anybody else to get her out of public office.&nbsp; The minute she supported Caban she lost me for ever.&nbsp; Caban would have been the worst thing to ever happen to JH.&nbsp; Imagine what it would be like to have a DA who doesn&#039;t enforce prostitution laws in Queens.&nbsp; What do you think would happen to our neighborhood?&nbsp; It is one thing to become a legislator and change the laws, it is another to be the chief law enforcement officer and decide not to prosecute criminals involved in the sex trade.&nbsp; Thank god Caban lost.&nbsp; I can only hope that AOC loses - I hope they throw the book at her staff and put them in jail, assuming the violated federal laws.

					You guys are completely out of luck!!! Caban will not prosecute people like this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Assuming the police arrest them for committing crimes, these guys will get no cash bond, even if they were charged with felony-level drug-related crimes, the DA will not prosecute, and they will probably go celebrate with hookers, that they will probably pick up on Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; Welcome to our new reality.&nbsp; &nbsp;
