The board needs to be able to say it&#039;s your TV or your walking or whatever. Ask when there have been complaints.<br /><br />Keep your communication positive and reasonable. You might also consider attaching pictures that show you have rugs throughout your apartment, etc. or anything you have in place that abates noise.<br /><br />These things are always ugly but do ask what you can do to abate the issue and open a discussion with the managing agent first, if there is one.<br /><br />IMHO, a building shouldn&#039;t impose a fine without an earlier warning and I would make that case to the managing agent and the board.<br /><br />Btw, I had a similar situation with my 80-year-old father in a co-op he lived in. They claimed he was making overnight noise even though he went to bed at 8:30pm each night. The thing they were unable to detail: What noise specifically? Pretty idiotic.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for your advice, my husband had had numerous conversations with the building manager, tenant and super about this issue. We received 3 notices about &quot;things being dropped on the floors at all times of the day including very early mornings (5:30am)&quot; - It could be my husband opening the bathroom door and closing it to use it since our cat lives in the bathroom during evening and early morning hours. Management knows we have padded carpet since we had to provide insurance letters and have the super available when we installed wall to wall carpeting in the apartment. The super will be requesting someone from management to come in and take pictures of the carpeting. <br /><br />We have discussed this issue with a lawyer when we received a 3rd and final notice of things being dropped during random hours and we may retain him if needed. <br /><br />I wrote lengthy letter to the building manager asking if we can discuss what constitutes as &quot;disturbing or unreasonable noises&quot;, if they can show us the noise log and what remedies they can suggest to us.

					I had a leak issue with my hot water shut off valve. I called a private plumber in since this is outside my wall. The plumber told me the problem is not a small leak in the valve stem and it is a building issue. My husband calls the super and he calls in the plumber and handyman. They fixed the issue. But then I find out they did more than what was asked. They replaced the shut off for the toilet and the shower valve. None of this was told to me until after the plumber and handyman left. The super stops by with the repair slip and asks me to sign off on the repairs. I do, then he tells me the toilet and shower repairs will be charged to me. <br /><br />I was so outraged since the repairs were done without my knowledge. I would have asked my private plumber to do it for me. Is there a way to dispute this? I was never shown the shower repair so I do not really know if they changed anything out.

					I&#039;m looking for coop insurance and I got a quote through geico since we have a car insurance with them. It seems very basic. <br /><br />Is there anything I should be looking for when I&#039;m shopping for coop insurance. We live on the top floor and I&#039;m afraid of water damage from a leaky roof, do most insurance cover this? <br /><br />

					My uncle recently bought his counter top from Auction Outlet of Queens they are in Ozone Park and he highly recommended them. 718-641-5872<br /><br />I find the home depot on Norther to be very crowded and I agree with Superclam that the one in East Elmhurst has less people and I usually can find help easily.

					We are in need of an electrician to add 4 outlets in a couple of rooms and a ceiling fan in our living room. <br /><br />I would really appreciate a recommendation and maybe an estimate of how much the job was. (New homeowners and I&#039;m not sure what is a fair price for this type of job)

					We&#039;re closing next week. I know my attorney will be giving me a list of how many certified checks to bring with me. <br /><br />I was wondering if anyone could give me an idea of how many checks to whom the checks were given to. I need to get my ducks in a row and make transfers before next week. <br /><br />We will not have a mortgage and this is a sponsored unit if it matters.

					kristag - I was thinking about doing a concrete counter top. I saw on Pinterest someone did this without having to remove the existing counter top.<br /><br />Maybe this can also be done with your kitchen. <a href="http://karapaslaydesigns.com/diy-ardex-concrete-countertops/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://karapaslaydesigns.com/diy-ardex-concrete-countertops/</a>

					Thank you all for your wonderful advice. I think I will take most of your advice and keep our cabinets&nbsp; and repaint them and add new hardware. We are going to replace the counter top, get a new sink, faucet and add a fresh coat of paint to the walls. <br /><br />I hope it comes out nicely and I will update as soon as we close! <br /><br />Any tutorials that have worked for you on refinishing cabinets and also counter top stores with installation would be grately appreciated
