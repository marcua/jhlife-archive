				Hi everyone, I thought I&#039;d start a thread for broker/realtor recommendations like the one on the Astorians.com website.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking about moving and have been looking at various neighborhoods.&nbsp; Do any of you have any thoughts on realtors in Jackson Heights?<br />Thanks!

				We primarily used Michael Carfagna when we were co-op shopping. He really knows the buying process, the details of every buidling and has good relationships with the co-op boards. Also, he has lived in the area for something like 20 years and is invested in the future of Jackson Heights. I&#039;d recommend him to anyone looking in Jackson Heights. From personal experience I&#039;d advise to stay away from 718 Realty and JH Landmark. The agents we met with were uninformed about the units. <br /><br />I have also heard that Michelle Boudain is great to work with, but we never met with her.

				I&#039;d recommend my husband, Anthony Faulkner. He works at Corcoran and lives in Jackson Heights. If you are thinking of selling your property, give him a try. He loves the neighborhood and has a wide reach of customers/buyers. His office number is 718.210.4014.<br /><br />Noriko<br />

				I highly recommend Vladimir Simkhovich from Jackson Heights Properties Real Estate, LLC.&nbsp; He&#039;s been in the neighborhood for over 25 years and is extremely knowledgeable of all the beautiful pre-war apartments in our neighborhood.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to be in the market for a $500,000 co-op to get his attention.&nbsp; I looked at 42 apartments in the neighborhood before I chose the one I bought and I worked with several brokers.&nbsp; Vladimir, by far, was the nicest, most honest, knowledgeable and patient broker I dealt with.&nbsp; He can be reached by phone at (646) 239-0166, by email at vladrealtor@yahoo.com, or you can visit his website at http://www.jacksonheightsproperties.com. <br /><br />-Alan

				I&#039;ve seen JH Landmark&#039;s listings on craigslist, but also have seen Vladimir and MPC Properties post ads there as well, so I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a valid indicator of their poor performance.&nbsp; However, JH Landmark was trying to convince us to bid on an apartment that was waaaay over our budget and recommended we make up the difference by taking money out of our 401ks and changing our tax codes... really crazy.&nbsp; We used MPC and loved Michael because he was honest.&nbsp; Vladimir also showed us some nice properties but seemed to talk them up too much.&nbsp; I guess that&#039;s just the business.&nbsp;

				MPC Properties, LLC. seems to be the best agency in the neigborhood hands down.&nbsp; Very professional.&nbsp; I dont know of any other broker who has sold and closed more listings then Michael Carfagna including my own.&nbsp; The guy knows a lot and I would recommend him to anyone.&nbsp; Hes actually lived in the hood for about 28 years, I knew him when he lived at the Towers.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s safe to say he&#039;s a big reason the neigborhood has made such a drastic change for the better. <br />-:rockon: S.O.R.B.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				My wife and i had a pretty good experience with Carfagna when we bought also. one of his assistants who we dealt with was a little pushy, but in the end we were happy.<br /><br />i would definitely stay away from JH Landmark. Friends of my were selling their apartment on their own, no broker, with an ad on craigslist. They actually had the nerve to steal their photos from their ad, and repost another ad listing themselves as the contact, and bumping up the price 10K. This could have hurt my friends, perhaps people would see the ad and assume they dropped the price when it had been on the market for two days.<br /><br />absolutely unbelievable and totally unethical. stay away!

				I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights almost my whole life. Many of my local friends have encountered and used Michael from MPC Properties over the years to buy and to sell.&nbsp; He seems to be the most reliable, professional and knowledgeable from what I&#039;ve been told.&nbsp; I do see MPC advertisements in the neighborhood and the Times often.&nbsp; I currently rent but aspire to own in the near future. In fact, I just started to browse recent property listings.&nbsp;

				I guess this may turn into &quot;pick me! pick me!&quot; contest. I just want to say something to everybody who wants to hire a broker, whether to buy or sell. Please, be careful. There are so many brokers out there and buying or selling a house is not like buying a meat stick. You need to find somebody who will want to sell or buy so badly that they will do anything to make that happen. Unfortunately so many brokers just sign a listing, put up an ad and then cross their fingers. You should always do what&#039;s best for you and your family and you should be careful when hiring a broker. I&#039;m not saying that you should or should not hire Marlene, Vladimir or me or whoever, I&#039;m saying that you need to make sure that person is the right one for the job. Also, always make sure you know all of your rights.<br />All the best

				We had very mixed experiences with brokers.&nbsp; Jomara Lopez at Weichert in Woodside was flexible and helpful, though we ended up not finding something with her.&nbsp; We didn&#039;t have a very good overall experience with JH Landmark; we found them to be very unprofessional.&nbsp; They refused to provide comps, were incredibly pushy, a little dishonest, and overall unpleasant to work with.&nbsp; I actually had a &#039;conflict resolution&#039; conversation with someone there about a particular employee.&nbsp; We did actually see something we liked with them but decided against it because dealing with the staff was so frustrating.&nbsp; In the end we (luckily) found something that was listed by owner. I agree with a previous poster - finding a broker is as much about finding someone that can relate to your needs as it is about finding someone with good listings. <br /><br />Slightly unrelated, but we actually looked in Westchester and Rockland before deciding on JH, and found an amazing, wonderful, helpful broker there.&nbsp; Anyone who is thinking of those areas should use Juliette Meyreles at ServiceMax Realty.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well I actually joined this board tonight after having a horrible realtor experience today, when I googled and saw that your bulletin board had recommendations for local realtors.&nbsp; After reading through the posts, and with no disrespect to the moderator, I must say that the experience I had today was probably with the same JH agency.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I should say &#039;agency&#039; loosely.&nbsp; While walking to the Berkley for the appointment I made after calling the JHrealestatediva website number (a cell phone), I found the corporate office of this agency was a private house on 77th Street with no awning or signage to even indicate it was a business.&nbsp; That should have been my first clue that this place was suspect ... I only wished I logged on here last night, to save myself the grief.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I got to the open house, the &quot;diva&quot; told me I was probably shopping outside of my price range.&nbsp; Nevermind the fact that I have $500 K ready to pay in cash following the sale of my parents&#039; house.&nbsp; The way she keep asking about my nationality, I would almost suspect her decision had to do more with the pigment of my skin, though to be fair, this wasn&#039;t said bluntly to me.&nbsp; It was more as if I was as if I was being ignored ... the realtor actually spent more time on her cell phone, arguing with (I presume) a babysitter about &quot;tantrums.&quot;&nbsp; I was ready to throw a tantrum too ... what a waste of an apartment hunting day.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case, I logged on to find a realtor who actually wants to do honest business.&nbsp; I am interested in pre-war Jackson Heights co-ops, as I grew up here (in the Greystones and Hawthorne).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for our shared negative experiences, while warning each other of shady realtors on bulletin boards is a good start, the best recourse is to complain to real estate board that licenses people like this.<br /><br /><em>[Edited by the moderator to remove a child&#039;s name]</em>

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I agree that no one should personally defame the character of anyone here, hopefully that was not viewed as the intent of my warning following yesterday&#039;s horrible experience.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since my post, I have received many personal messages (thank you all) both with recommendations of brokers (my next day off, I&#039;ll be calling a few), and with shared experiences with my own.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moderator is correct in that it would be inappropriate to post anything other the facts of our experiences here.&nbsp; Nor would it be appropriate to single any one person out ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, if *any* poster here feels that they were ever mistreated by *any* real estate sales person, no matter who he/she may be, there are more effective recourses.&nbsp; (For example, if hypothetically you were called multiple times and harassed by an agent, or hypothetically asked to alter your tax info in a way that was criminal.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*All* real estate persons are licensed, much like teachers, pharmacists, etc., and subject to rules of conduct and ethics by law.&nbsp; Complaints can be made to New York State&#039;s Office of Real Property Services (http://www.orps.state.ny.us;&nbsp; 518-474-5711, and 518-474-6157.)&nbsp; It is my understanding that *any* person receiving three complaints would have their license suspended and possibly revoked.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hopefully this information, which does not include &quot;negative remarks about the character and motives of an individual,&quot; will provide a helpful forum to those members of the virtual community (and our own) that have had mistreatment by *any* realtor/broker/sales agent.

				I also just joined, and probably for the same reason. I&#039;m not someone who typically posts to message boards simply because I don&#039;t often feel the need to contribute to the conversation. (As they say, when you&#039;re satisfied you tell your friends, but when you&#039;re not you tell the world.) It is unfortunate that others had a poor experience with a particular agent, formerly of JH Landmark.&nbsp; As I know nothing of their particular experience, I can only speak of mine. We were shown multiple listings in multiple buildings. I found our agent to be organized and knowledgeable. She avoided wasting our time and the seller&#039;s time as much as possible. She was always honest and straightforward and never sugarcoated anything. (This turned out to be quite useful in making decisions and there were rarely surprises.) Her listings were always nice and she knows the neighborhood very well. When offers were made on her properties, she did everything she could to speed the process along. She made a sincere effort to explain the entire situation, answer every question, arrange additional showings of listings, and she continued sending new listings that became available in the target price range. Unfortunately, it so far hasn&#039;t worked out for us to buy one of her listings, but we would have (on two separate occasions) were it not for circumstances wholly unrelated to our agent. She is a vivacious, outspoken human being who has tried to do the very best she can for us. As always, experiences vary.

				I am a proud new owner of an apartment in the Greystones. I had looked in Dunolly Gardens, and some other Co-op apartment buildings. I had looked at a previous apartment with an agent from MCP properties who really tried to pressure me by saying that he had someone coming next who said they wanted to buy asap. I basically told him that the apartment was not for me and left. After looking around I replied to a Craigslist posting for the apartment I bought. I can honestly say that the the broker made me feel relaxed and didn&#039;t pressure me at all. The guy was honest and had told me that the apartment was on the market for a while and that I should make an offer. He outright told me why people didn&#039;t want the apartment (5th floor walkup, apartment in need of overhaul.)<br /><br />Jon Fisher of Douglass Elliman lives in the neighborhood, recommended a great lawyer, and also recommended the Contractor and Electrician who are in the process of fixing up the apartment. Jon worked hard to put together my co-op application and was savvy enough to know what was wrong and what I needed to change. Even though buying an apartment and renovating has been stressful and tough - I can&#039;t begin to think of what I would have done without his advice.<br /><br />Chris

				<br />Wow!&nbsp; I thought I never would have to come the aid of another realtor. LOL&nbsp; I read some really ugly stuff about Marlene Flores here.&nbsp; I also read some nice things about her and about other brokers.&nbsp; As an environmental and construction consultant as well as a partner in an Asbestos &amp; lead abatement company and Coop construction firm I meet lots and lots of people.&nbsp; I also happen to be a &quot;mulitple association&quot; realtor so I don&#039;t list units but simply market them and sell them for different brokers.&nbsp; <br /><br />I started selling in Queens almost 2 years ago and sold close to 40 units in that time.&nbsp; In Jackson Hts I sold about a dozen units.&nbsp; I love Jackson Hts and I had the chance to meet Marlene on a couple of occassions and spoke to her quite a few times on the phone.&nbsp; WOW, what a charachter she is.&nbsp; I first met her with a client that wanted my opinion on the unit and wanted me to renovate the same.&nbsp; After speaking with her a few minutes she recognize me and was wondering if I was there to steal her client (or something to that effect).&nbsp; She struck me as an &quot;unfriendly, to the point and don&#039;t wasyte my time&quot; kind of individual. <br /><br />After dealing with her a few times I realized that she is the type of individual that is very effective as an executive or top management.&nbsp; These &lt;i&gt;types &lt;/i&gt;tend to be abrupt and distrusting of others.&nbsp; They lack tolerance for mediocresy and will not allow people to waste their time and they will will TELL you in your FACE!...LOL.&nbsp; She is working in an environment that requires more &quot;people skills&quot; and since Jackson Heights is one of those &quot;community&quot; neightborhoods she may just have to adjust her attitude a bit.<br /><br />At the end of the day I can say that she is not a &quot;racist&quot; (being Latina and very into the culture).&nbsp; My experience is that she is informed about the properites and in fact she is probably on of the most informed realtors in Jackson Hts.&nbsp; She does have a relationship with many Boards and if you really want to get into a premier building in Jackson Heights she is one of those realtors that will get you in.&nbsp; Some people will say she is mean (I&#039;m one of those people), but defaming her is uncalled for and ridiculous and absolutly unffair. If you want to recommend a realtor recommend them and say what you must.&nbsp; Stay away from character assasination since realtors have feelings too (Even the &quot;diva&quot;).&nbsp; <br /><br />Unfortunately for me I don&#039;t have many properties in Jackson Heights and I am not one to list properties.&nbsp; I sell (I can outsell just about anyone...LOL) because I can.&nbsp; I am a business owner and understand the growth I have seen in Jackson Hts.&nbsp; I want to congratulate everyone writting because it says volumes about you and your passion.&nbsp; I hope that othjer neightborhoods learn from you and take your example.&nbsp; Stay the course and continue the wonderful activities and don&#039;t forget to patronizr your local eateries and businesses.<br /><br />G-d Bless and be well<br />Luis F Martinez, Sr (aka Louis)&lt;h4&gt;

				Well, when I was on the market for a new apartment, I had quite the real estate adventure.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been living in JH well over a decade, working here longer than that.&nbsp; I knew what was out there, and I knew exactly what I wanted.<br /><br /><em>A large pre-war two bedroom, flooded with light and air.&nbsp; I wanted the whole pre-war deal... the wooden floors and high ceilings and moldings and arches.&nbsp; I wanted a garden.&nbsp; It had to be cat-friendly.&nbsp; I wanted high floor, with an elevator.&nbsp; I wanted to continue having a comfortable walk to work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh.&nbsp; And I wanted a â€œpretty view.â€</em><br /><br />And I wasnâ€™t in a hurry.&nbsp; I had all intentions of finding what I wanted.<br /><br />I met every realtor out there in the process, and looked at over 40 units.&nbsp; I would guess that Marlene showed me almost half of them.<br /><br />I have to say that no one works harder than Marlene.&nbsp; She was pushy.&nbsp; She called me every day for monthsâ€¦ even when I was out of town.&nbsp; And, like nearly every realtor I dealt with, she told me I was not going to get everything I wanted, and that I needed to compromiseâ€¦ blah blah blah blah.&nbsp; But she worked hard.&nbsp; I honestly felt bad that after so much of her time and energy (and the time and energy of Vladimir and Michael and some other great folks, and lots of clueless Manhattan realtors who were trying to move into the neighborhood), I ended up buying a sponsor unit from the sponsorâ€™s agent.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I got exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; <br />

				That is a good posting KC. It is a tough market out there and not a lot of inventory. Many brokers are working hard and don&#039;t have much to work with.. A few weeks ago I went to about half a dozen open houses. I had my apartment valued. I thought about downsizing but after seeing the stock, I decided it would be much easier to pay attention to the space I have than to move.

				This is all mildly amusing to me as someone who has owned 3 apts in JH since most of the names are newer brokers in JH -- just as an aside, for many years, almost all sales in the historic district of JH were handled by Maire Breen and Mercedes Langan and they listed in NY Times sunday only (never online) ...&nbsp; we bought two apts through Mercedes Langan.&nbsp; She was very kind and was trusted by the coop boards. I have not seen anything listed by her recently. I think the internet did her in as an agent. read this article &amp; weep over the prices . . . http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DE1F3DF932A35751C1A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink <br /><br />When we were selling, we tried selling through Ms. Langan, had trouble around 9/11 and ended up selling ourselves. The second apt we sold ourselves also, but were about to sign with Virgil Cannatella, a broker with Douglas Elliman who lives in Hawthorne Court and is really great. One thing to consider if you are selling is what the advertisements for your apt will be and who will pay -- a broker may not have to pay the costs out of his/her commission if he/she works for a large agency.&nbsp; An agent for a smaller company may not want to spend a ton on advertising out of their own budget. As I recall, Elliman was going to pay for a set amount of NYTimes ads.<br /><br />I have never met him, but Michael Carfagna is selling an apt upstairs from me and he seems good for sellers -- he prices things aggressively high but also shows the apt often and does tons of open houses. <br /><br />We bought our newest apt through someone who just happened to have the listing but is not based in JH.

				<strong>I tip my hat to all those realtors that engage in Open houses.&nbsp; Bless their souls, I can&#039;t deal with the professional habitual open house lookers &nbsp;I have only sold a few units in JH (just over a dozen or so in the last 16-18 months).&nbsp; While I am mainly based in W Heights I do share in an office in JH but only 2 or 3 times monthly for financial meetings reasons only.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the units I have sold are the same ones I renovate for my clients (over 20 in Corona in the last 12 - 14 months).&nbsp; <br /><br />But I am associated with a couple of guys that sold quite a few packages two and even three times over in the last dozen years (try thousands of units).&nbsp; Those packages are all but gone and the few that remain are full of rent stabilized units so most investors are quite careful with those.<br /><br />I have never worked with other realtors in JH and the only 2 or 3 times that they tried to do the &quot;seller agent&quot; thingy they were just desperate to find something their buyer would like and were really unprepared because many didn&#039;t even realized they were dealing with &quot;people posing as buyers&quot; vs buyers.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t have them pre-qualified by a bank and they never check their assets!&nbsp; What happened to &quot;let&#039;s not waste peoples valuable times&quot;&nbsp; and I am not even talking about the &quot;just lookers&quot;&nbsp; I am speaking about the agents...OMG.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I will not Co-broke my exclusive sponsor units...they sell within 45 days and often much faster anyway.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean I wont in the future but since the sponsor units is what I am currently dealing with I have no problem keeping it in a tight circle and still sell than much faster then I could a resell</strong><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"> <span style="font-size: 16pt;" class="bbc_size"> Anyway, good night...I&#039;m out of here!!</span><br />(http://toons.artie.com/toons/jalopy/arg-sm-jalopy-rev-tr.gif)</div>

				Greetings!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to recommend Jon Fisher of Prudential Douglas Elliman as an outstanding real estate agent to work with in finding the right property to fit your needs. He is a warm an ardent person who&#039;s enthusiasm tends to really help and push the whole buying/selling process along.&nbsp; My wife and I recently purchased a unit in The Belvedere on 85th street and were very pleased with the interview package (neatly bound and subdivided sections) that Mr. Fisher put together for our coop board to read and study.&nbsp; In fact he did such a good job that during our interview the coop board president stated how impressed he was with his neatness and organization. Mr. Fisher also takes pride in the neighborhood as he has raised his family and currently resides in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; My wife and I felt that because of this he could give us a greater insight to the &quot;in&#039;s and out&#039;s&quot; of the area.&nbsp; Our overall experience working with him was excellent, he is easy to talk with and candid in his assessment of the neighborhood properties.&nbsp; Please feel free to contact or reply to me here as I would be happy to convey any other information regarding Jon Fisher.&nbsp; Here is a link to his bio at Prudential.<br /><br /><br />http://www.prudentialelliman.com/mainsite/agents/agents.aspx?BID=JLF<br /><br /><br />

				Best kept secret if you&#039;re looking for a RE broker: Joan Sanders, 718-429-0001.&nbsp; She keeps an ear to the ground and knows the business inside and out and has been living in JH for years and years.&nbsp; She&#039;s also a huge supporter of people in the arts and non-profit world and I can think of at least seven artists or artist/writer couples who have purchased apartments from her in JH and are very happy.<br /><br />She&#039;s unusual in many ways, but one of those ways is that she rarely uses the internet as a tool.&nbsp; I found her on one of the rare occasions she posted an ad on craigslist, but more often she sells via word of mouth and an occasional ad in a newspaper.&nbsp; One of her most recent buyers told me that at first they were quite resistant to contacting her as they couldn&#039;t imagine anyone in the RE field being so non-internet savvy in this day and age.&nbsp; Now of course they are sorry they underestimated and they really just feel so lucky to have ended up with their apartment.<br /><br />Many of the apartments she sells are never advertised at all.&nbsp; I asked her why she doesn&#039;t advertise and she said she doesn&#039;t need to.&nbsp; She makes the sales through word of mouth. <br />

				Marge Kaufman is a very good broker. She works hard for the buyer or the seller (the customer). She knows what is needed and can guide her customer through the process. Know people who have had postive outcomes and recommend her without hesitation.<br /><br />Check the listings - she lives in JH also.<br />

				For those that have been looking for a good realtor, you should definitely check out Jon Fisher. I recently purchased my apartment on 83rd street and he was incredibly responsive and helpful--especially with all the unknowns (mortgage brokers, banks, maneuvering the co-op board waters). Always had a lot of energy and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Best part for me was that his office put the co-op board package together, which was really cool. I would imagine if you&#039;re selling a place, too, he&#039;d certainly be someone you should call. <br /><br />His info is at: <br /><br />http://www.prudentialelliman.com/MainSite/Agents/Agents.aspx?BID=JLF<br /><br />Good luck out there.

				The banks now seem to dictate the worth of the apartments as appraisal guidelines have changed. Or at least that has been my most recent experience.<br /><br />The last appraiser from Chase looked at the most recent comps/sale for the past three months within a JH building and within a 1/4 mile radius.&nbsp; The appraisal on a 1,200 sq. ft. unit (two bedroom, two bathroom) was $390K at a 20% downpayment.&nbsp; Please note that the building is in the heart of JH and the appraisal was done mid December.&nbsp; The Chase appraiser could not find a sale any where that was more than $390K that had taken place in September, October, or November, her in JH, and was contacting all brokers/agents in JH to see if he could find a recent sale that had not appeared in the public records.&nbsp; Apparently, it was not found.<br /><br />What a unit is on the market for and what it will sell for is very interesting.&nbsp; I have just experienced an appraisal issue, and therefore assume that others in the JH community have as well.&nbsp; My take is that unless the buyer puts down a large downpayment, and takes out a smaller mortgage, there may not be an appraisal issue, but I&#039;m not sure of anything at the moment, as banks are being extremely cautious in their lending.<br /><br />I recall having banks and mortgage brokers order the appraisal and the accepted comps/recent sales considered were within the past year.&nbsp; Now the most recent appraisal considered only the comps/recent sales for the last three months.<br /><br />I would love to hear from other brokers/agents share their current experiences as it relates to the pricing on the JH co-op units and the ultimate sale price.&nbsp; And their experience on how the bank appraisars are working on their sales.<br /><br />Example:&nbsp; Are JH co-ops listed at $550K getting offers of $525K, $490K, $450K?&nbsp; And are they appraising.&nbsp; If they are, what is the downpayment requirement for these properties.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the JH community would like to know.&nbsp; Not only brokers/agents but those that have units on the market FSBO.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have these answers now as my most expensive listing at the moment is $459K with a 33% downpayment requirement.&nbsp; And it ain&#039;t moving.&nbsp; <br /><br />Michael, due share where you get your comps for those beautiful properties that are in the $500K&#039;s and up and Helen, as well please share.&nbsp; Also, why has that stunning Greystones duplex not sold.&nbsp; Helen is wonderful and shares all her listings.&nbsp; You go girl!<br />Helen

				<strong>Anyone thinking of selling their coop or condo should do one thing first...<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">CALL MANAGEMENT AND ASK THEM FOR A LIST OF THEIR LATES SALES IN THE BUILDING.</span>&nbsp; What good is it if your broker tells you how wonderful you apartment is and how chic and spacious...that it looks like a 5Th Ave flat if in fact the last sale in your building is $200 per share or square foot or what ever the particular combination they decide to use for the appraisal.&nbsp; Chase uses such a wide range of appraisers that there is very little you can do to get a good and fair one.<br /><br /></strong><div align="center">My advise;<br /><br />a.&nbsp; Ask Management to provide you the most current sales complete with shares and description (any responsible and professional Management will have this readily available)<br /><br />b.&nbsp; Take the average share price and compare it with the type and square footage.&nbsp; If you see that the the average differs greatly from the lowest and highest in the last 3 or 6 months be ready to have your broker challenge it.&nbsp; <br /><br />c. Give your agent a copy of this list and make sure your agent is present to speak to the appraiser so that he or she can explain their position on the comp sheet.&nbsp; Make sure the appraiser gets a copy of the same.</div><br />If you do this you can price the unit at a realistic price that will get it sold reasonably fast.&nbsp; If there are too many available units in your building or in similar buildings of the immediate area be ready to either spruce up your place for the competition or price your unit 1% below a comparable competing unit.&nbsp; If your apartment looks amazing and your building has lots of interest price it 10% above the previous higher sale in your building but be ready to negotiate it as low as 10% or more if you feel you can&#039;t wait a few months for your sale.&nbsp; Do Not over expose your unit and make nice with members of the Board so that you have a smooth transaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should know that there are too many UNREALISTIC sellers out-there that refuse to look at the realities of the market or the real price of their units.&nbsp; They feel that they have the most amazing apartment in the world and that since their cousins Earl sold their unit for $450 per square foot they should be able to do the same. <br /><br />Would be buyers seem to be walking into apartments and one of the first things that come out of their mouth is &quot;The market is really bad&quot; or something to that effect to try to low ball a price.&nbsp; Let your agent handle it, he or she will be able to tell them that Coops have stayed strong in Queens and especially in areas like Jackson Heights, blah, blah blah.&nbsp; There are many disappointed &quot;would be buyers out there&quot; and too many sellers as well...don&#039;t let your buyer and your property be a statistic. [/b] &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>On a last Note, if you paid very little for your property and can afford a full renovation do it.&nbsp; A well though out&nbsp; and beautiful renovation will get your unit off the market within 30 days most of the year.&nbsp; You may net much more than you put ion but be careful not to over spend because while it will get you lots of offers you still have to recoup your investment.</strong>
