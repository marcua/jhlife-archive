				Open Borders Books, a new bookselling collective in Jackson Heights, has been laying out an impressive selection of books every Sunday on 34th Avenue between 79th and 80th, from 10am to 12pm (weather permitting). <br /><br />Books are pay-what-you-want and half of all sales each month will benefit a local aid organization. In our first month of operation, we donated $657 to Make the Road to support their programs for immigrants.<br /><br />You can learn more about us at openbordersbooks.org (http://openbordersbooks.org) or browse some of our books on Instagram @openbordersbooks. We&#039;re looking forward to meeting you, but please wear a mask when you come to check out our books!<br /><br />Yours,<br />Jeff<br /><br />

				&nbsp;Yikes! Make the Road has that much money! No wonder they have become a political force. I hope the original mission has not been lessened by all the big bucks. A bookstore would be absolutely great though. Would patronize heavily.
