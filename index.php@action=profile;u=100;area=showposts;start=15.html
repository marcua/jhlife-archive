					The last time I heard was&nbsp; the 74th street Merchants Association is not working with Western Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Just ask Will Sweeny to make the fact straight. And it seems like they refused to form the BID since they don&#039;t want to spend any money for community.&nbsp; <br /><br />&gt;and the level of sanitation service the city provides is not adequate to keep the area clean.&nbsp; <br /><br />I disagree.&nbsp; I am not talking about garbage can being full.&nbsp; I am talking about things like stylefone box with chicken and rice thrown on the streets.&nbsp; &nbsp;How can you blame city for such garbages?&nbsp; Yes, we can raise the money and have somebody else clean the streets.&nbsp; &nbsp; But why can&#039;t&nbsp; we individuals respect the public and each individuals takes responsible for the garbage?&nbsp; All I am proposing is that <br /><br />Current situation:<br /><br />Pedestrian has trash.<br />Releases fingers.<br />Trash falls on ground.<br />Creates eyesore.<br /><br />Proposed situation:<br />Pedestrian has trash.<br />Walks a few extra steps to trash can.<br />Releases fingers OVER trash can.<br />Pedestrian no longer has trash.<br />Street still clean.<br /><br /><br />Todd, I believe there is difference between being a racist and respecting public.&nbsp; All i am trying to have people respect public.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

					I hear people openly complain about graffiti but what about garbage on streets.&nbsp; As we all know, the 73rd street and 74th street between 37th ave and 35th ave is filled with garbage.&nbsp; Subway entrance on 73rd and 37th Road gives really bad impression for people who just arrived Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Yet, people&nbsp; are afraid to openly complain about the situation on 73rd and 74th street probably because they don&#039;t want to be considered to be attacking one ethnic group.&nbsp; But the street is shared by everybody and people should respect the public space. If a certain ethnic group does not have a civic sense and not respect the public, I believe it should be criticized and they should learn to respect others.&nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to hear your opinion.

					I did not know the zone study was done.&nbsp; I would like to know the result also.&nbsp; What can we do to know about the study since Helen Sears has been ignoring community&#039;s request?&nbsp; &nbsp;At least we have a right to know the result of&nbsp; the study.&nbsp; For people who don&#039;t know the condition of 73rd street and 35th ave, it is a chaos with traffic congestion and never ending honking.&nbsp; A Certain group of people not only from New York City but also&nbsp; all the way from Connecticut and New Jersey are coming&nbsp; for shopping in that area causing the huge traffic congestion IN RESIDENTIAL AREA.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if you notice but yesterday, December 25th, the condition was really really bad.&nbsp; From Roosevelt to 34th Ave were congested with cars.&nbsp; Adding more stories for the business development is going to only hurt our community.&nbsp;

					Koku, that&#039;s so typical behavior of her.&nbsp; She just talks superficially and actually does not do anything.<br />There was a request from the community to extend the park on 78th street between 34th ave and 35th ave because the space right next to the park was available after the auto dealer closed their business.&nbsp; I remember Helen Sears told the community that she is going to work on it and nothing seems to be done. Does anyone know what she has done about extending the park???&nbsp; We need more park in this neighborhood.

					Just to let you know..<br /><br />I have nothing to do with the Journal.&nbsp; I am just one of many residents who are frustrated with our District Council who has done nothing for us.&nbsp; I also found through this forum that she also intervened to form BDI on 74th street, which could have helped cleaning up the filthy streets.&nbsp; Again, she only works for people who give money.&nbsp;

					What do you think about our District Council, Helen Sears.&nbsp; I have an impression that she really doesn&#039;t work hard to improve the quality of life for residents in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; She is rather interested in serving for group that provides her campaign funds.<br /><br />I was reading the The Jackson Heights Community Journal and found out the issue about demolition of historical house on 74th street and 34th ave.&nbsp; According to the Journal, Jackson Heights Beatification Group tried contacting to discuss the impending of the demolition and she ignored the request, which is not surprising considering that a large portion of her campaign funds in the past have come from real estate developers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another thing I have heard is about the congestion problem on 37th ave and 73rd street.&nbsp; The community have been asking for change to Ms. Sears for almost decade and she has done nothing.&nbsp; Finally, The Western Jackson Heights Alliance was formed to deal with this issue asking controlling the business development of the area which is causing traffic congestion and noise pollution.&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard that she has been very uncooperative with the organization.&nbsp; This is no surprising either because she got funds from Merchants on 73rd and 74th street.<br /><br />what do you think about this?&nbsp; Do we have any power to ask for&nbsp;resignation because of her attitude toward community??

					West Jackson Heights Alliance is involved in this for a long time.<br /><br />they have a website <a href="http://www.wjha.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.wjha.org</a><br /><br />also, they usually have a community meeting every month inviting city officials to express our concerns.&nbsp; I encourage people in JH to involved since the more people show up in the meeting, the stronger the message we are sending.<br /><br />As far as traffic study goes, they just finished monitoring the traffic last month.&nbsp; The device was there for a month.&nbsp; I have not heard anything since then.&nbsp; Does anyone know the status of the study?&nbsp; Traffic on 73rd street is one of the biggest problem in our neighbor.&nbsp; Hopefully, this study will fix that...<br /><br />
