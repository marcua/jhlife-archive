				Title: <strong>Cat Behavior</strong><br />

				HI There,<br /><br />So I&#039;ve finally moved and all 3 cats are getting along relatively OK. They keep their distance but there hasn&#039;t been too much hissing or fighting. I think I may have seen the two boys secretly playing. (They have a facade to keep up you know). <br /><br />There are two boys and a girl (all fixed) in our little cat family. The girl has picked up an interesting habit of digging around the food bowls that&nbsp; her and her brother eat out of. She also covers them with her body while she does this. My cat, the older boy eats his own food on top of the fridge away from the other two food bowls and where the little ones can&#039;t get to it.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming the little girl is doing some sort of primal food protection thing. But I just wanted to put this out there and make sure it&#039;s not a behavior that could be a sign of stress for her or if there is something that I could do to make her feel more at ease with the fact hat my cat has no interest in her Iams. Thoughts ?&nbsp; <br />

				Hi,<br /><br />Congratulations on your move.&nbsp; It&#039;s great that the cats are coexisting so well it seems!<br /><br />I have a cat who tries to bury her food sometimes and I always think she&#039;s just expressing her opinion of the particular flavor&nbsp; :) .&nbsp; I agree that it&#039;s pure instinctual behavior, and I&#039;m not sure you could get through to her that it&#039;s not necessary.&nbsp; For what it&#039;s worth, this cat is particularly sensitive and &quot;sophisticated&quot; in a way (for example, she loves people and other cats but is always keenly aware when someone other than her is getting attention, and has been known to either barge in or just run the other cat off).&nbsp; Maybe she just has me trained really well, but I do feel I have to make a special fuss over her sometimes, and it seems to help her relax and keep her pretty darn happy.&nbsp; It sounds like you are on the right track by just making sure your girl feels loved, secure and comfortable in general.<br /><br />Good luck and congratulations again!
