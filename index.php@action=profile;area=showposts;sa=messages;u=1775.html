Possibly in the same fashion that you can point out Fifth Ave. in Park Slope as an example of class displacement (I agree). Just by living here and talking to people.&nbsp; So to clarify, I&#039;m not making judgments based on hair styles or brand of stroller.<br /><br />It&#039;s not a contradiction for me to think Travers has a cliquish vibe and still frequent it with my child. Nor that I think there&#039;s a lack of civility towards strangers but still have made friends there. I just think it is harder than it ought to be.<br /><br />It was also not my intention to set up a Park Slope vs. JH thread. Park Slope was used as a background point or geographic reference more than anything else.<br /><br />I think that&#039;s enough &#039;nots&#039; for now. I submitted the original post about Travers because I do know some other parents who have expressed how difficult it is for them to interact with people there. Especially, since they&#039;ve moved to JH specifically for its reputation for being friendly to children of many different or multiple races. So they&#039;re wondering if it is only themselves who feel this way and if somehow they&#039;re missing out on the multicultural happy bus.<br /><br />I just wanted to relay my own experiences as well as to point out that sometimes groups are not as diverse as they seem on the surface. And there&#039;ll always be people that you won&#039;t like regardless of class, ethnicity or religion.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who have shared their experiences and suggestions. It&#039;s really great to see that potentially explosive topics such as race and class can be discussed in a civil and open manner.

					We moved to JH from Park Slope some years ago and have a young child. Travers does have a cliquish vibe. In my experience, trying to initiate a conversation or just a greeting is often more difficult than it should be. That isn&#039;t to say that we haven&#039;t met people with whom we do get along. <br /><br />It&#039;s just that Travers, and to some extent JH, lacks a certain openness for new people from different races or classes to mix socially. Outside of an approved venue such your child&#039;s daycare or your religious institution. I&#039;m referring to a basic civility towards strangers. Such as acknowledging my presence when my child is playing with yours and I&#039;m standing right next to you. And I&#039;m smiling or talking to you.<br /><br />We are working professionals with a biracial child. I specifically brought up class because at least the times that we&#039;re at Travers, the divisions don&#039;t seem to be about race but about class or perceived class.&nbsp; The groups themselves are often ethnically diverse.<br /><br />I&#039;m putting this out there for those who have had similar experiences. No neighborhood is perfect and JH is often portrayed as a multi-racial utopia.&nbsp; You&#039;re not alone and there&#039;s nothing wrong with you. JH has some great things to offer, but like every place else, it has got some fundamental issues to work on.
