					This article ran in the Crain&#039;s Real Estate section. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/madison-avenue-hub-jackson-heights-could-face-rocky-retail-recoveries-report-says" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.crainsnewyork.com/real-estate/madison-avenue-hub-jackson-heights-could-face-rocky-retail-recoveries-report-says</a><br /><br />Madison Avenue, The Hub, Jackson Heights could face rocky retail recoveries, report says<br /><br />Three major retail spots in the city face different challenges as they look to recover from the pandemic downturn, according to a new report from HR&amp;A Advisors.<br /><br />The study, put together with tech startup Live XYZ, examined the strengths and weaknesses facing The Hub in the South Bronx, Jackson Heights in Queens and Madison Avenue in Midtown. Overall, the analysis suggested that The Hub would be the least resilient of the three neighborhoods, &quot;unfortunately no surprise, given that this is also a low-income community of color,&quot; it said. But Jackson Heights and Madison Avenue could run into problems of their own.<br /><br />HR&amp;A looked at preexisting vacancy rates, the percentage of essential businesses that never had to close, chain stores that would likely be better able to absorb an economic hit, and businesses&#039; abilities to take advantage of more relaxed outdoor seating rules.<br />Related Article<br />&#039;Pretty bleak&#039;: Record drop in retail sales<br />The city&#039;s retail market: Separating fact from fiction<br />City retailers face long road to recovery despite national sales rebound<br /><br />The Jackson Heights area was found to be best positioned for recovery based solely on vacancies with a pre-coronavirus rate of just 8%, according to the study. The Hub had a 12% vacancy rate, and Madison Avenue had a 14% vacancy rate.<br /><br />The Hub had the highest percentage of essential businesses such as grocery stores and pharmacies at 27%, followed closely by Jackson Heights at 26% and Madison Avenue at 15%. That such stores never had to close makes them more likely to survive and provides a point of strength for retail corridors to build on, the report said.<br /><br />But Madison Avenue was best positioned to take advantage of the economic strength of chain stores and outdoor seating rules. The report found 30% of its businesses are chain stores, and 65% of its businesses have enough space to create sidewalk seating. Just 16% of businesses in The Hub are chain stores, and only 40% of them have enough space for sidewalk seating, the report found. In Jackson Heights, these numbers were 6% and 64%, respectively.<br /><br />Sulin Carling, a principal at HR&amp;A and an author of the report, said the chain-store issue was an interesting one, because neighborhoods essentially could be exchanging economic vibrancy for economic security.<br /><br />“Madison Avenue with all of those chains, maybe they’ll fare better,&quot; she said, &quot;but is that a good thing, if more of those small businesses fail and we have an even greater concentration of chains on Madison Avenue?&quot;<br /><br />Jackson Heights has a large amount of small immigrant-owned businesses that might have a hard time navigating red tape and recovery resources, for instance, whereas Madison Avenue could face a severe retail crisis if many of the neighborhood&#039;s former office workers switch to working from home more permanently or if enough Manhattan residents who left the city during the pandemic do not return, the report said.<br /><br />&quot;If people are going to shift to remote work, it actually may really not end up doing very well,&quot; Carling said of Madison Avenue, &quot;and so as we talk about reopening, as we talk about all the different ways that we can support businesses and revitalize corridors, I think it&#039;s just going to be really important to see what’s happening on the ground.&quot;<br /><br />The study took into account median household incomes in each of the neighborhoods. Those incomes were $21,000 for The Hub, $56,000 for Jackson Heights and $146,000 for Madison Avenue.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Peralta Way.” The ceremony brought together local officials, neighbors and the family and friends of Peralta, including his wife and children. <br /><br />City Council Member Daniel Dromm passed legislation to co-name the street in honor of Peralta. Dromm described Peralta as “a beloved civic leader and elected official who left an indelible mark on the community he served for many years.”<br /><br />Peralta made history by becoming the first Dominican-American elected to the New York Senate when he was voted into office in March 2010. He served Senate District 13 from 2010 until his death on Nov. 21, 2018 at 47 years of age. <br /><br />A photo of the late Sen. Jose Peralta at Sunday’s ceremony (City Council Twitter)<br /><br />Peralta was most known for his support of undocumented immigrants, specifically young people who he believed deserved equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream.<br /><br />In 2013, he introduced the New York State DREAM Act and built support for the bill in following years. It was passed and signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo earlier this year and was renamed the José Peralta New York State DREAM Act after his death. Undocumented children, who are students in New York schools, now have access to state aid for higher education.<br /><br />The late senator’s tenure was also marked by a focus on immigration justice, support for working class families, access to quality education for all children and advocacy for LGBT rights. <br /><br />Prior to his service in the State Senate, Peralta served in the State Assembly from 2002 to 2010. He was a member of the New York Senate Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian caucuses, and of the Puerto Rican Hispanic Task Force.&nbsp; <br /><br />“New York political history will remember Peralta as a legislator of principled advocacy and genuine kindness,” Dromm said. “The Peralta family looks forward to watching his legacy live on through every civic-minded young person inspired to serve their community and fight for a more just America.”

					I&#039;m seeing lots of reports about Petland Discounts closing in NY, CT, and NJ. I haven&#039;t seen a list of stores, but some outlets are just saying &quot;all stores&quot; in these states are closing. It wasn&#039;t my favorite pet store option in the neighborhood, but it is still sad that our options are shrinking even more. <br /><br />Anyone have any news on the ground from the store itself?

					Around 11p/12a at night, I often hear someone making bird calls outside our bldg (&quot;Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr&quot;). Is this a drug thing? A cops-are-coming thing? Someone just making noise on their way home from work? Am I reading too much into this? It happens fairly frequently, so it has to be a call for something.

The incredible diversity of the borough is it’s backbone and perhaps it’s greatest attraction.<br /><br />“We have people coming from over 130 countries,”states Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, “ and with that they are bringing all of their culture, their arts, their dancing, their music and their food.”<br /><br />Someone who knows about the diversity of Queens all to well is actor John Leguizamo, whose family immigrated to the Jackson Heights section of Queens from Columbia. “It’s the perfect human experiment,” John tells Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric. “Everybody came to this neighborhood. Jackson Heights Elmhurst is the most diverse place in the world per square mile… and that’s what made this neighborhood great.” John’s childhood in Queens remains a big influence on his work, especially in Ghetto Klown, his acclaimed one man show that was recently turned into a graphic novel.<br /><br />John is one of many film and television actors who call Queens their hometown including Ray Romano, John Turturro and John Favreau. And while many think Manhattan is the center of film and television production, the business is BOOMING in Queens. This is thanks to variety of locations the brough has to offer, as well as the large studios, none more iconic that Silvercup Studios, right at the foot of the Queensborough bridge.<br /><br />Silvercup Studios President Stuart Suna has seen everything from The Sopranos to Sex and the City to 30 Rock shot in his buildings, and has seen the industry continue to grow over the years. “The huge transformation of the industry was really due to the New York State tax credits,” Stuart comments, “it’s actually the highest return of investment of any tax break in the history of New York State. It’s created over 100,000 new jobs.”

					I received this through my network, today, and immediately thought the volunteer they seek has to live in Queens! Passing along: <br /><br />Research is being done at American Museum of Natural History on Balinese textiles from Indonesia.&nbsp; We are looking for volunteers who can translate from Bahasa Indonesia to English. The Bahasa Indonesia texts are excerpts from books on Balinese cremation rituals and dance rituals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Your work will be acknowledged in the printed catalog that accompanies an exhibit in Spring 2018 to be held at the Bard Graduate Center. If you are interested or know of somebody who can do this on a volunteer basis please contact me.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thanks,<br />Nicole<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nicole Winns │ Associate Director<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Department of Volunteer Services<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Central Park West at 79th Street │ New York, NY&nbsp; 10024<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.amnh.org" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.amnh.org</a> │212.769.5563 │ <a href="mailto:nwinns@amnh.org" class="bbc_email">nwinns@amnh.org</a>

					Tonight, I heard a story while at Sal&#039;s Hair Salon of someone feeding the pigeons outside the salon this morning only to round them up, throw a net over them, and take off with them. There was much speculation on what the culprit could actually be doing with the pigeons. My guess is eating them. <br /><br />Anyone else witness this this morning or any other time in JH? <br /><br />I Googled NYC pigeon hunting and this recent article came up: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/whos-stealing-pigeons-in-new-york-city-805" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.vice.com/read/whos-stealing-pigeons-in-new-york-city-805</a><br /><br />Also these: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/eating-pigeons-in-nyc-jackson-landers-hunting-invasive-species_n_1920973.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/eating-pigeons-in-nyc-jackson-landers-hunting-invasive-species_n_1920973.html</a><br /><br /><a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/a-bizarre-pigeon-abduction-in-chinatown/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/07/a-bizarre-pigeon-abduction-in-chinatown/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />

					I discovered a great blog, today, thedisabledfoodie.com via AM New York article (via Google News): <a href="http://www.amny.com/news/a-seat-at-the-table-disabled-queens-foodie-david-friedman-scopes-out-spoke-friendly-restaurants-1.10481077" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.amny.com/news/a-seat-at-the-table-disabled-queens-foodie-david-friedman-scopes-out-spoke-friendly-restaurants-1.10481077</a><br /><br />Fellow Jackson Heights resident, David Friedman chronicles his journey through NYC restaurants not only with the standard review of food, but also brings much needed awareness to accessibility at the venues. <br /><br />As baby boomers age, the US population will increasingly need accommodation for disabilities in their everyday travels. The more people bringing this to attention will make sure that restaurants, venues, and hopefully everywhere will make sure that ADA compliance is fully integrated into their new construction and/or renovations during planning phases and not as an afterthought!

					Bees are taking over Queens! <br /><br />I think the first incident a few weeks ago was actually Elmhurst: <a href="http://pix11.com/2014/08/22/queens-woman-finds-50k-bees-in-attic-brings-nypds-tony-bees-out-of-retirement/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://pix11.com/2014/08/22/queens-woman-finds-50k-bees-in-attic-brings-nypds-tony-bees-out-of-retirement/</a><br /><br />This happened this past weekend: <a href="http://7online.com/pets/thousands-of-queens-bees-removed-from-jackson-heights-apartment-/292085/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://7online.com/pets/thousands-of-queens-bees-removed-from-jackson-heights-apartment-/292085/</a><br /><br />Does anyone know anything about these bee swarms?
