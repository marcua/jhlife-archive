				I just started to feed a stray black cat (bit of white on neck) on 77th street between 34th-35th Ave. It was in the bushes and seemed very hungry. It initially ran from me but came back for the food so I assume is a feral cat? Does anyone know of anyone else feeding strays around there? I live in Southridge and feed a lot of strays near me so its hard for me to feed there.<br /><br />Also I am going on vacation starting this Friday for 5 days and need someone to feed and water this poor cat. I am willing to pay someone reliable $10 per day to do this and I will supply the cat food. Please reply here or you can email me at jpassof1958@gmail.com. Please someone help me help this poor cat.

				do you notice if his/her ear is clipped? If not you may want to contact a TNR group. It is very important to have these strays fixed. Could you possibly post a pic, perhaps someone is missing him.&nbsp; I can post it to the queens lost and found Facebook group for you.

				I will try tomorrow to take a picture but the cat ran from me so I assume it&#039;s feral. I will check for tipped ear. I will feed this cat temporarily but I am feeding too many other strays and it&#039;s too far from my house.

				Here is a photo of the cat, its the best I can do because it ran down into a window when I approached. I put food down and after I moved away it came to eat and was very hungry. It is in the bushes to the right of the entrance to 34-41 77th Street.<br /><br />I cannot feed this cat indefinitely because I don&#039;t live around there and feed strays in my area. I hope someone will take over feeding this cat I will help with food and money.

				I too looked at the cat.&nbsp; But she/he is on private property.&nbsp; Where do you put the food and how?<br />She was sitting all the way back by the wall of the building so you would have to go into that building&#039;s front lawn.&nbsp; Apparently there are a lot of cats living in the back of that building but the superintendent is not willing to do anything about getting them neutered/spayed. It&#039;s a rental building so there is no co op board to appeal to.

				I noticed a posting for a lost all black cat tonight on 81 Street between 34 &amp; 35 Avenue .&nbsp; Named &quot;Star&quot;, she is 11 months old and has been missing since 7/17.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if this could be that cat?&nbsp; Thought I would mention it just in case. I then passed by 77 Street but didn&#039;t see any sign of the cat.

				There is a listing for Star on lostmykitty.com.&nbsp; If you think this might be her, you can contact the owner via the website.&nbsp; The street posting also has a phone number &amp; I left a voicemail message.&nbsp; Looks like Star is pure black without any bit of white, but no harm in checking it out.<br /><br />https://www.lostmykitty.com/details.cfm?petid=28066

				&nbsp;Cats are regularly left at Travers Park. This has been going on for decades and there are people who feed them. When and <br />how am not sure. But if they are in the vicinity, the cats will find the food, I trust. Also, I have seen Garden School folks <br />helping with cat care and they have sponsored animal adoption vans for years now.

				Does anyone know if anyone has tried to trap this kitty and rescue her (I think it&#039;s a her since she seems kind of small compared to my girl)? I saw her today and called her to get a better look, and while she never left the safety of the bushes, she did come closer. I think she might be rescue-able, and with cold weather coming soon, strays really pull at my heart strings. If I didn&#039;t already have a diva that I know would be a nightmare with another cat in the house (and no way to quarantine a stray), I&#039;d try getting this kitty myself.

				My friend and I have tried to trap this cat three times, the last time being Saturday night for about three hours. I tried different food in the trap and still she did not want to go in. I would take her home myself. <strong>However starting Thursday this week until Friday Oct. 14 I will be having house guests so I probably won&#039;t try to trap until after Oct 14. </strong><br /><br />After Oct 14 if anyone has any suggestions let me know. She will not let us grab her or come near her.

				can you feed her in the trap but not set it so she gets used to going in there for her food?&nbsp; I know its difficult since it is a highly visible place.&nbsp; Can you put the trap in a black trash bag?&nbsp; Also what seems to work the best for most cats is warm rotisserie chicken.
