				Hi!<br />My boyfriend and I just bought a co-op on 37th Ave. We love everything about the apartment, the building, and the neighborhood - except the traffic noise.<br />Does anyone have any experience soundproofing windows? We are looking into citiproof and citiquiet. <br />Also - are there any community movements to get enforcement of double parking and honking laws?<br /><br />Thanks!

				I can&#039;t vouch for any soundproof windows, but what about when you want to have the windows open? Street noise is a classic NYC problem that I can&#039;t imagine will go away anytime soon. <br />Enforcement is very difficult, it&#039;s such a temporary thing. Jerks stop at the light with their bad music blaring, but they&#039;re gone in a minute or 2. Calling 311 wouldn&#039;t do a thing. The most I&#039;ve ever seen is a cop yelling at a car to lower their music. I&#039;m sure it was raised 2 blocks later. <br />I use the fan function on my A/C unit as a white noise generator; there are lots of similar devices out there. My noise woes come from noisy upstairs neighbors. <br />Good luck with the new place and welcome to the neighborhood!

				I use Peltor Next No-Touch earplugs all of time I spend at home - while working, while on the computer, while sleeping, etc. If I don&#039;t have them on, I am listening to music with headphones or watching TV. When I used to live with someone, I would still use my earplugs unless I was doing something or speaking with my significant other.

				I lived on 37th Avenue for seven interminable years. I used white noise machines and kept the air conditioner on (you can set it to fan to bring air in from the outside).&nbsp; &nbsp;I now live on 34th Avenue. I wish you luck, unfortunately I can relate with your pain.

				We put in citiquiet windows about a year ago in our bedroom and are very happy.&nbsp; They don&#039;t block the landing planes (we are on 73rd) but they DO help.&nbsp; They were not cheap, about 1k a piece, but i think they are worth it.&nbsp; the funny thing is now we hear other noises in the building we never heard before, that were drowned out by the white noise coming in.&nbsp; But that&#039;s city living....

				Thanks everyone! We&#039;re getting quotes from both companies this week but based on this board we&#039;ll probably go with citiquiet.

				Make sure you check with your co-op board. Windows are considered part of the common structure by most offering plans.

				my wife and I got Citi Quiet windows and I can tell you that they make a WORLD of difference.&nbsp; As said before, a little pricey but well worth it.&nbsp; Cuts noise (planes, streets, 7 train) in a big way.&nbsp; Like night and day.&nbsp; Or, more accurately, like noise and silence.
