				Can anyone recommend a place to get their knives sharpened in JH? This was last brought up in 2009 so I&#039;m hoping we finally got someone in the last 6 years.

				I don&#039;t know anyplace around here, but I have seen signs for knife sharpening in Woodside on 31st Ave between 56th St. and 57th St., across from Blvd Gardens at a cleaner/shoe repair etc. place.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been meaning to try them but haven&#039;t gotten around to it yet.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can find plenty of places in Manhattan and are trying to avoid going that far, but I&#039;ve also seen a knife sharpener who sets up in Chelsea Market on certain days.&nbsp; http://www.samuraisharpening.com/schedule.html

				Mr Flannel works in food, and swears by the lady at Chelsea Market. If people have good experiences of others, I&#039;d love to hear, especially closer to JH. But, one bad sharpening can really ruin the effectiveness of a good knife and shorten it&#039;s lifespan. A German style knife that loses it&#039;s curve lousy for mincing, for example.

				I took a couple Wusthof knives to Boris today and it was pretty ugly. I learned a life lesson, I think: if you have fancy knives, then bring them to the fancy knife sharpener.&nbsp; Whatever tool Boris used went all up and down the side of the knife in random, burnt-looking patterns. The edges of the blades might have been sharp, but had burrs and were generally uneven.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say they are ruined because I am not a fancy chef and they will still cut things, but it was not the experience I was expecting. (I was expecting to be like &quot;OMG, I can&#039;t wait to go home and chop things!&quot;) Instead I am a little bummed...<br />

				I have Wusthof knives and just sharpen them at home when needed.&nbsp; It may take a little practice at first but it&#039;s pretty easy once you get the hang of it.&nbsp; All you need is a combination waterstone, such as this one off Amazon...<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/King-KI001-Combination-Waterstone-1000/dp/B0000Y7LAS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442789657&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=water+stone<br /><br />For a casual user one stone like the above will last a <strong>very long</strong> time.&nbsp; You just need a little time, a little patience, access to water, and a steady hand.<br /><br />@antparty - I mourn for your knives.&nbsp; At least they still cut ok.
