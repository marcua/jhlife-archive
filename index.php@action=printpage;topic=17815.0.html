				Hello all,<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d share the news that the Foodtown has really mixed up their offerings as of late. They have converted a chunk of their produce section to offer more prepared foods. I admit I haven&#039;t given it a very close look.<br /><br />Also they added a refrigerated case on the right just as you enter the store which features cheeses. For their first go it&#039;s a bit of a mix bag of options. They have quite a few cheeses with truffles and prices to match that delicacy status. They also have an old standby like Saint Andre triple cream brie which was priced higher than I remember seeing it elsewhere (but it&#039;s been a while since I last bought this). What really surprised me was they even offer two cheeses from the California artisan organic cheese purveyor Cowgirl Creamery, which they priced comparably to Whole Foods.<br /><br />I know some people in this area are clamoring for new local options. I give foodtown credit for trying something new and attempting to respond to the changing tastes of this area. Check &#039;em out and maybe ask for more of the cheeses you&#039;d like to see?

				I noticed that this morning but staff were working on it so I didn&#039;t stop to investigate.<br /><br />Just by the way, Trader Joe does a very nice triple cr√®me brie, reasonably priced.<br /><br />

				the cheese counter is very nice, and they&#039;ve ramped up the prepared salad offerings, which are surprisingly good, generously portioned and fresh. it looks like the food dynasty (which i haven&#039;t been inside, due to their labor practices) is going the other direction and emphasizing lower prices.

				And Food Dynasty is back to being open 24 hours. From peeking in the windows when I walk by, they don&#039;t seem as empty as they used to be - there are probably lots of people who weren&#039;t living here yet during the boycott and don&#039;t know how awful they are to their employees. I wonder if anything has changed.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s nasty in there!&nbsp; I went once in desperation and was disgusted by the lack of temperature control in the freezer aisle - half of the freezer cabinets were full of that kind of ice you see when a freezer needs to be defrosted.

For one thing, they reliably carry a kind of Snapple I like that Foodtown rarely has. For another, often Foodtown is simply too damned crowded. If I just want to pick up a couple of things, I&#039;m not going to fight the long lines and congestion at Foodtown. (I do some of my grocery shopping near my office in Manhattan, too.)<br /><br />It&#039;s not that I don&#039;t care about the union issue. But I&#039;ve never been clear about what proof there is that Food Dynasty is owned by the same company that owned the previous incarnation. Can you fill me in on that?<br />

				the same name -- Mr Haque -- is listed on permits, for one thing. the managers are the same. and according to local news reports, they initially promised to bargain with the union around the time of the name change, but then didn&#039;t follow through. can&#039;t find any evidence that they made things right. if anyone can i&#039;d welcome that.

On a tangentially related subject, the area near their meat counter has smelled terrible lately! I&#039;ve heard they had a problem with a clogged drain pipe back there. So, whoever they have working back there, I feel sorry for them.
