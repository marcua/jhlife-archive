				How in the world can they not get the permit to close one street for the farmers market every Sunday?&nbsp; We have a dozen parades a year that must require massive $$$ to close all those streets &amp; you barely have that many people that actually go and watch.&nbsp; Yet the weekly farmers market is a vital cog of the neighborhood, enjoyed by a huge amount of local residents. It should be a no brainer.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i agree, except for the fact that 78th street is already closed (and demapped). that could be hard to navigate.

				It would require 1 cop and a wooden road block.&nbsp; Not that big a deal, cars can go down 2 more streets to get to northern.&nbsp; It should very simple.

				^Are you unaware the location of the farmer&#039;s market is temporary and that it is currently relocated because of the work at Travers Park?

				Imagine what the people in that building on the north side of 34th Ave are already going through.&nbsp; 78th St is closed permanently. Construction noises from the park renovation continue.&nbsp; And the crowds every Sunday must be aggravating enough with the double parking and shoppers blocking their garage.&nbsp; Let&#039;s make them suffer some more by shutting down 79th Street also.

				And today there were police barriers at both ends - much easier to navigate. I hope the residents were not too inconvenienced.

				I assume it was only closed because of the parade on northern, but yes it was a welcome surprise. <br /><br />The residents in that building have no access to 79th st.&nbsp; The garage for the building is on 34th ave.&nbsp; Closing that street is a no brainer, Itâ€™s only schools on either side.
