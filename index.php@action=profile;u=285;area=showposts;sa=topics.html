Please be respectful and courteous to others, even if you don&#039;t know the particular song we&#039;re singing at the moment. We will sing in every and any language the members of the group know, including American Sign Language from students and faculty at the Lexington School. <br /><br />Small, accoustic, portable instruments welcome and encouraged.<br /><br />We will begin by walking up 75th Street, in the direction of traffic, while singing. Then up 32nd Avenue toward 76th Street, down 76th Street toward 31st Avenue, up 31st Avenue to 77th Street, up 77th Street towards 32nd Avenue, etc... The group will then determine at which point we should change the direction to head back towards Cassidy&#039;s Ale House, and how long we stay out there singing.

JH<br />is lucky enough to have a community composting site where all your local deposits are turned into soil and used on our <br />street trees. No transportation involved!

I remember hearing awhile ago that one of the tennis players was offering to give instruction to young players<br />and I think this is the group. <br />&nbsp;Does anyone know more details? <br />&nbsp;It looked like some quality instruction and they were keeping a large group of kids active.

					<span style="font-size: 10pt;" class="bbc_size"> The fantastic appointment of Tom Finkelpearl as our new Cultural Affairs Commish bodes well for the<br />arts community of NYC. This is an informed decision as he has been at the forefront of some of the most<br />innovative and progressive long term agendas in the arts community. Personally think the new Queens<br />Museum is wonderful -go if you haven&#039;t been in the past six months- and that seemingly unlikely <br />combination of patience and tenacity that he used in getting that renovation done should be great for <br />his work with the whole city. Check out more in the NYTimes article:<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/arts/design/mayor-de-blasio-names-tom-finkelpearl-of-the-queens-museum.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/arts/design/mayor-de-blasio-names-tom-finkelpearl-of-the-queens-museum.html?_r=0</a><br />&nbsp;Congratulations Tom! And kudos to the team that had the vision to seek him out.<br /></span>

					There was a favorable review recently of the efforts of Tawa and its owner. This little place also was a tv<br />segment of the Bizarre Foods show with Andrew Zimmerman. Tiny, tiny place but the flavors are distinct.<br />A bit spicy for me and I didn&#039;t love the owners comment about me coughing for a long, long time and <br />how much water I drank. My business thank you very much. But it is worth checking out right here in<br />Jackson Heights. And I would go back knowing what to avoid in the very spicy category.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/dining/hungry-city-dhaulagiri-kitchen-in-jackson-heights-queens.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/dining/hungry-city-dhaulagiri-kitchen-in-jackson-heights-queens.html?_r=0</a>

					&nbsp; &nbsp;Happy Holidays JH. Hold onto that Christmas tree a little while longer and bring it to Mulchfest 2014 on <br />January 11&amp; 12th. Once again it will be held in Jackson Heights at Travers Park. The trees are put into a <br />chipper which chops them into a coarse pine-scented mulch. It&#039;s fun to watch and kids seem to love it. <br />You can take a bag of chipped pine back home for personal use in your home garden or to put around <br />your favorite street trees. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year JHSCRAPS, our local composting site on 69th street took in truck loads of pine chips from <br />NYC Sanitation truck chippers and these were distributed locally in tree pits and planting projects sponsored <br />by the JHBeautification Group. Truly local recycling!!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;You can bring your tree to our JH chipping location, Travers Park, 34th Ave bet. 78th and 79th sts on <br />January 11 &amp; 12 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m and look for the official Mulchfest signs and chippers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Or you can bring your tree to a drop-off site from Saturday, January 4 through Sunday, January 12. Leave<br />your tree with us, and we’ll recycle it for you later! The NYC Department of Sanitation will also be conducting<br />special curbside collections&nbsp; for mulching and recycling of Christmas trees from Monday, December 30, 2013 <br />through Wednesday, January 15, 2014.<br /><br />***Want to volunteer at MulchFest ? Register to join the GreenTeam and MillionTreesNYC volunteer group.

					&nbsp;Frustrated with the Common Core madness? Lack of support for teachers in general?<br />&nbsp; Our local independent school, Garden School, at 33-16 79th street in the middle of Jackson Heights has a curriculum that is learning based, not test based, and has been at it for 91yrs.Small class size and lots of individualized instruction helps your child recognize their strengths and gives extra help in challenging areas. Garden School offers language studies (French, Spanish &amp; Mandarin), AP courses, real physical gym -including the pool in warm weather- extraordinary art classes as well as a host of clubs and after school activities like Robotics, debate team, Model UN, lots of sports for all levels, theater events, Young Writers sessions, dance &amp; music lessons and children&#039;s gardening and cooking among other offerings in their extensive after school programs. Students are encouraged to try new things and given the support to do so. The school reflects the true diversity of Jackson Hts with lots of ethnicities, languages and cultures represented.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are fed up with the educational bureaucracy, Garden School would be a great alternative. Certainly there are many students who do well in huge schools, but there are those who will greatly benefit from a smaller, nurturing community where they are known by name throughout. Being a welcome part of your child&#039;s education all the way through their school years is something most upper levels schools do not encourage but here you will be invited and included in many parts of their learning. Weekly and sometimes daily online reports are very helpful in keeping parents informed and your child will be part of a school community in ways 2yrs there and 3yrs in another school does not often allow.
