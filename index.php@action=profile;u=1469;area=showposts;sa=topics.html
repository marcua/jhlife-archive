					Hello Everyone!<br /><br />Currently we&#039;re hosting a local artist by the name of Ellen Schneiderman at our gallery, Dutch Kills from June 12-July 4th.<br /><br />The reception is happening on Saturday, June 12th from 6-9pm and it is open to anyone and everyone who is interested in seeing more of her work.<br /><br />Where: Dutch Kills Gallery<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;37-24 24th Street, Suite 402<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long Island City, 11101<br /><br />More about the Artist:<br /><br />Ellen Schneiderman&#039;s mixed media works are influenced by systems that categorize species and specimens, macro and microbiological forms, and her own tendencies to organize, record, and contain. In her paintings, nested rectangles of cut paper house globs of dried paint and create imperfect grids. Inked patterns are covered by poured acyclic mediums to become new images based on actions of chance. Chunks of paint and mixed color from her palette, often from past paintings (failed or realized), become collected sediment. Entangled painterly gestures are obstructed and revealed by dovetailed shapes. These involved processes and meticulous constructions are created with deep consideration for the painting&#039;s physical surface and materiality.<br /><br />Thanks everyone!<br />Dutch Kills Gallery<br />dutchkillsgallery.com

					Putting-It-All-Together: Collage, Montage, and Assemblage<br /><br />February 6-21, 2010<br /><br />OPENING RECEPTION<br />Saturday, February 6, 6-9pm<br /><br />We are pleased to have the renowned collage artist, Jonathan Talbot, as our Juror of Awards for our exhibition Putting-It-All-Together: Collage, Montage, and Assemblage. Mr. Talbotâ€™s work has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and in exhibitions sponsored by the US State Department and the Smithsonian. He is friend and supporter of collage artists everywhere. <br /><br />Max Ernst said of collage, â€œCollage is the noble conquest of the irrational, the coupling of two realities, irreconcilable in appearance, upon a plane which apparently does not suit them.â€ Likewise it could be said of montage that it is an art of connecting disparate parts to create order from difference. And assemblage is an activity of the mind projecting the supernormal in the organization of junk.<br /><br />climate/gallery<br />37-24 24th St, Suite 406<br />Long Island City, NY 11101<br />tel: 718 784 2737<br />hrs: thu-sun 12-5pm<br /><br />An exhibition of new work by...<br /><br />Mira Aldridge<br />Kit Brown<br /><br />February 6-28, 2010<br /><br />OPENING RECEPTION <br />Saturday, February 6, 6-9pm<br /><br /><br />Image:(top)Mira Aldridge,(bottom)Kit Brown<br /><br /><br />Dutch Kills Gallery<br />37-24 24th St, Suite 402<br />Long Island City, NY 11101<br />tel: 718 784 2737<br />hrs: thu-sun 12-5pm<br /><br />

					Exhibition: Unsound Practice<br /><br />Opening Reception Saturday September 5th 6-8<br /><br />Special Performance by Twistycat @ 9<br /><br />Special video prsentations/performance: Gaia Persico<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kirt Markle<br /><br />Dutch Kills is pleased to announce â€œUnsound Practice,â€ September 1-14, a group exhibition showcasing six artists whose work investigates the interplay of visual art, sound and text. <br /><br />Featuring the work of Matthew Callinan, Jools Johnson, Tom McCloskey, Jo-ey Tang, Mikel Telleria and Marjorie Van Cura, this exhibition takes as its point of departure the contemporary experience of an excess of â€œnoise.â€ If the phenomenon of â€œnoiseâ€ characterizes the information age, constituting a soundscape of competing voices, textual and discursive networks, transmissions and communicationsâ€” how has this transformed both what and how we &quot;see;â€ how do such plurivocal emissions â€“as well as their suppression, loss or erasure-- influence contemporary image-making and the cultural production and status of works of art?<br /><br />Whether reflecting a theme of â€œnoiseâ€ through a practice grounded in a critical appropriation of existing materials and technologies or through aesthetic choices, the showâ€™s artists share a concern with exploring the margin between visual art, text and sound.&nbsp; Using a diverse array of strategies and techniques, each provides a unique interpretation of the contemporary soundscape. Receptive to the incessant murmur, whisper or disappearance of sound, to words and the circulation of texts, to noise perceived as viral, disruptive and disorderly or, alternatively, as generative, riotous, and dissonant, each of the showâ€™s artists rejects traditional forms of representation in favor of an experimentation with new or invented codes, unsound practices.<br /><br />A re-evaluation of the relation of noise/silence (signifying, for example, the presence of absence) opens a space for unexpected liaisons, translations, re-encodings, interruptions inscriptions and recordings that blur the lines between genres, mediums and inside/ outside.&nbsp; Receptive to the cacophony as well as to the omissions, deletions and hegemonic relations of power in discursive constructs, each offers a critique of the autonomy of systems of perception as well as a positive conception of an artistic practice that is embedded in the social, economic and political situation.<br />

Like an alchemist searching for the perfect element, the search itself is the goal. The outcome is the strange, discordant resonance produced by recycling and combining media. <br />Graciela Cassel presents her work as a poetic object. Like feminine desire, it functions as a critical but allusive enemy within systems of power and knowledge<br />Whitey Flagg is inspired by the cartography of subjects relating to human impact on the environment and data visualization techniques. His works are a hybrid of physical and conceptual space. <br />Herman James is informed by the environmental degradation created by our global emissions into the atmosphere.&nbsp; Most recently heâ€™s undertaken a study entitled â€œLoaded Landscapesâ€ exploring psychological aspects of the representation of landscape and their connections to our deepest impulses, aspirations, and ambitions. <br />Loli Kantor explores the transitions of contemporary Jewish life and culture in Poland and Ukraine. Kantor is a fine art and editorial photographer based in Fort Worth, Texas. <br />Tucker Schwarz utilizes thread and fabric to generate images based on photographs intertwined with personal memory, serving to trigger our memories and speak to our collective feelings of anxiety and vulnerability. His 3-dimensional work mimics the unraveling nature of the drawings with the implication of imminent collapse.<br />Isaiah King explores prints, paintings and drawings in pursuit of an ongoing study of the human form in all its complex emotive facets. His work with graphic design encourages public discourse on social and political issues.<br />Niki Kriese embraces tasks that are seemingly bound to fail and accepts the vulnerability of being wrong. Her interest lies in the futility of containing the ineffable, of portraying the glint of chemistry, and of recognizing traces of the absent. <br />Kendrick Mar investigates childhood emotions. The darkness of these primal feelings is expanded upon with humor and pathos. <br />Nicole Parcher creates lively and curious environments through the exploration of mark making and materials. The jumbled landscapes hum with a chaotic harmony, much like the world we live in. Parcher&#039;s work extracts from the notion of drawing and collage and applies it to painting, thus narrowing the gap between them. <br /><br /><br /><br />Red Vinyl is an instrumental, electronic rock collaboration between Kathryn O&#039;Shields and Jeff Mapua. Their sound is a fusion of church organ, hair-metal guitar solos, 80â€™s keyboard riffs, and hip-hop beats.<br />Scrote is &quot;...looped and tweaked live noise guitar mixed with random acts of reckless sonic abandon...often multi-speakered performances that explore live spaces by moving soft sweeping sounds through combative thunderous explosions for an audio interplay from corner to corner...&quot;<br /><br />

					Niki Kriese<br />&quot;Cast Shadows&quot;<br />Saturday, July 11 â€“ Sunday, August 2, 2009<br /><br />Reception:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Saturday, July 11, 6 - 9 pm<br /><br />Performances by<br />9:00 pm&nbsp; &nbsp; Audra Wolowiec<br />9:30 pm&nbsp; &nbsp; Yuka Otani<br /><br /><br />New York, NY<br /><br /><strong>Dutch Kills Gallery</strong> is pleased to present Cast Shadows, the first New York exhibition of <strong>Niki Kriese</strong>. This exhibition furthers the artistâ€™s interest in connection and memory, finding inspiration in what is not visible but sensed. Combining sculpture, painting and video, the artist highlights the unstable divide between the two and three dimensional, questioning the relationship between what is elusive and what is concrete.&nbsp; Imagery of hands speaks to the desire to touch and connect, and gloves suggest masking or covering while remaining faithful to the silhouette of the form. Kriese is interested in the concept of tracing as wrapping, as drawing, and as commemorating a moment. â€˜Traceâ€™ can also imply an invisible imprint left behind as evidence of an absence. The work in itself is often evidence of the process undertaken, a souvenir of the meaningful action. <br /><br /><strong>Audra Wolowiec</strong> is a multi-disciplinary artist who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Her work is often performative in nature, using architecture and the body to explore various forms of communication and sensory re-interpretations of the everyday. She received an MFA in Sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2007 and a BFA in Textiles from the University of Michigan in 2002. Audra will present Silence is a Language, a set of performances based on scores that interpret how the mouth plays a roll in visual communication. Asking several participants to perform the same score, the voice will be used to punctuate the collective space of silence.<br /><br /><strong>Yuka Otani</strong> is a multimedia artist who explores transparent materials, such as glass, water, and light. Intrigued by the &#039;slipperiness&#039; of those materials, she creates installations and performances that address the dynamism of time and ever-shifting perceptions.<br />
