I was born in &#039;62. Lived in Spanish Gardens 84th between Roosevelt and 37th and then my family moved in &#039;67 to 74st off Broadway (technically Elmhurst but J.H. was across the street and Woodside behind us).<br /><br />A few that I don&#039;t think were mentioned.<br /><br />Blimpies on 74th a few doors down from Fern&#039;s<br /><br />The butcher shop 74st and 37th rd. (was it ottomanelli?)<br /><br />Fashion Rack on 74st.<br /><br />Readypenny Inn 73st <br /><br />Station Break Roosevelt 73st and 74th.<br /><br />Bickfords on 74th and Broadway<br /><br />Fannie Farmer 74th and Broadway<br /><br />Pizza Den 74th and Broadway<br /><br />Unisex Hair Cutter 74th and Broadway<br /><br />Essex House 74th and Roosevelt (a classy looking diner that was Crazy Chicken until recently)<br /><br />Purity Diner 75st and Roosevelt<br /><br />Casa Bella Italian Restaurant 75th and Broadway<br /><br />The Liffey Bar 76th and Broadway<br /><br />Queensboro Lanes (underground bowling alley between 83rd and 84th and 37th ave<br /><br />Small Video Store (name?) on 73st between 37ave and 35th ave closer to 37th ave.<br /><br />A toy store on 83st and Roosevelt that had creaky wood floors (what was the name?) <br /><br />There was a record store on 82nd st across from Genovese (what was the name?)<br /><br />German deli on 74st and Roosevelt where you went down the steps to the subway<br /><br />The Subway Arcade at Roosevelt Ave.<br /><br />The pool hall above the bus terminal on 75th and Broadway.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I can think of many more.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>God, you&#039;re good!&nbsp; Bickford&#039;s!&nbsp; That was inside the terminal at 74th and Roosevelt.&nbsp; That was where my father took me for hamburgers.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was another pool hall on the corner of 82nd and Roosevelt, by the train station there.&nbsp; Across 82nd Street was Chock Full &#039;O Nuts, on the corner (not part of the original arrangement of the early 60s), then, around the corner, Meyers ice cream parlor, then the Continental deli (a good German deli on every block, in those days!) then Shelley&#039;s bakery (the best bakery in town) and the butcher shop, and then something else that I can&#039;t recall; maybe a jewelery store.&nbsp; <br /><br />Across Roosevelt was the bank, on the corner, then the notions shop, then, I think, the Army/Navy store - - and then maybe a toy store (or perhaps that was on the next block).&nbsp; <br /><br />Around the corner from the bank was the Colony Delicatessen, a florist&#039;s,maybe a pizza shop at one time, a little records/instrument shop, the Jackson movie theater, and a little fruit store and butcher shop on that corner.&nbsp; Around the corner was, eventually, a little book shop.&nbsp; <br /><br />And there was that little triangle, with benches and a few old trees, where people would sit and feed the pigeons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coming down 82nd Street, toward Roosevelt, on the opposite side of the street, was a small apartment building that was put up in the mid-60s, on the corner of 82nd and Baxter, the candy store, belonging to the Sbarrs, a little Spanish record shop, a tiny grocery store, then the small vacuum cleaner store, then a couple of little old buildings with professional offices in them, then a beauty salon called Si Jolie, I might be missing something here, then the Associated food store, something else that I don&#039;t recall, Joey D&#039;s Pizzeria, a Hallmark store, a doughnut shop, a little luncheonette, a creepy little building that once had a fortune teller in it (there was a bus stop in front of the luncheonette), Disco Roosevelt Drugs, on the corner, a florist around the corner from it, a couple of other things that escape me at the moment, and on the next block, the Lido Italian resturant and the New Cathay Chinese resturant (Cantonese and Mandarin).&nbsp; There was, I recall, a picture framing shop on that block.&nbsp; <br /><br />On the corner of 80th and Roosevelt was the vet, Klausman&#039;s.&nbsp; A funeral home across the avenue.&nbsp; <br /><br />On 81st and Roosevelt was that steak house that someone mentioned, that was a meeting place for sharply-dressed mafiosos in the builders association, where they would have lunch, and another great German deli; there used to be a candy store on that corner, way back, before they put in that steak house.&nbsp; Then another bank.&nbsp; <br /><br />A candy store on the corner, opposite Disco Drugs, and the pool hall over that candy store.&nbsp; They put in a Puppy Palace for a while, I remember, next to it, I think.&nbsp; Opposite, next to the Chock Full &#039;O Nuts was a jewelry store, a Merit Farms, Joyce Leslie and another women&#039;s store, either after or before a teeny little pizza place, downstairs from which was the bowling alley, then another store that sold cut flowers, I think - - all very narrow shops, there, and the Woolworth&#039;s, etc..&nbsp; <br /><br />On Broadway, off 82nd Street, which became Baxter Avenue, was a big German resturant, with lots of little mounted antlers all over the place, called the Hoffbrau.&nbsp; A car wash across Broadway.&nbsp; The Elmwood Diner on the other side of the street, beside the playground across from the hospital.&nbsp; <br /><br />And every Christmas-time they&#039;d put up garlands and lights all down 82nd Street, and on 37th Avenue, and at night, to a little child, it looked lovely and special.&nbsp;

The butcher between 81st &amp; 80th on the north side of 37th was Sullivan&#039;s. <br /><br />The North Fork/Jamaica Savings/soon to be Capitol One was a Rexall drug store. <br /><br />There was a boutique called Marie Sheridan&#039;s where Bang Bang was. Super fancy ladies stuff.<br /><br />There&#039;s always been a stationery store btwn 82 &amp; 81st Sts. It was Weiss&#039;s, then Weiss Brothers. then Wise (with an Owl logo). The stores between there and Jahn&#039;s were an electronics store - Murray&#039;s? (Owner was Murray) and a liquor store - Battapaglia&#039;s. Rumor was that Danny Battapaglia was a bookie. Wouldn&#039;t know, that was grown up stuff.<br /><br />That is my selective memory from the past 55+ years.<br /><br />So nice to read the other memories.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><em>I do believe that there was also a florist shop right next to Jahn&#039;s.&nbsp; I remember that they would put their stuff out in the rain; used to like meeting my friends at Jahn&#039;s on rainy days.&nbsp; And there was some sort of mysterious-seeming Chinese laundry around the corner from Jahn&#039;s.&nbsp; Coffee shoppe across 81st Street, with Field&#039;s across the avenue, and the library (another haunt for rainy days) right off the corner, behind Field&#039;s.&nbsp; </em>
