				I was walking my dog on 35th Avenue the other night and was thinking about how it would be fun to show my Scrabble-obsessed sister the 35th Avenue street sign that&#039;s written out with Scrabble letters/points on the corner of 35th Avenue and 81st Street next to the Community Church -- an homage to the game that was invented in JH and was first played at the church.&nbsp; I looked up as I crossed 81st Street and to my surprise, the sign was missing!&nbsp; I did a double take, made sure I was in the right spot, and, in fact, the street has been removed.&nbsp; The normal 35th Avenue street sign is there but the Scrabble version, normally above it, is not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know what happened to the 35th Avenue Scrabble street sign???

				Try Jeffrey Sanders (Saunders?) he and the Beautification group were responsible for the signs.<br />It was getting very faded - maybe they took it down to &#039;beautify&#039; it before the Historic weekend walking tour.<br /><br />Or some thuggish louts stole it.

				This is now an international embarrassment!&nbsp; The (London) <em>Guardian</em> comes looking for Scrabble&#039;s birthplace, and finds the sign is gone.&nbsp; How we disrespect our heritage!&nbsp; Somebody should at least spray-paint &quot;caziques&quot; on the sidewalk...<br /><br /><br />Saturday June 28, 2008<br />The Guardian<br /><strong>Spell bound</strong> (http://lifeandhealth.guardian.co.uk/wellbeing/story/0,,2287712,00.html)<br /><br />When the Great Depression left architect Alfred Butts out of work, he scrabbled around for something to do - and came up with a game whose ingenious mix of anagrams, crosswords, chance and skill is still a winner, 60 years on. And yet it nearly didn&#039;t see the light of day... Oliver Burkeman reports...<br /><br /><br />The highest score that it is theoretically possible to achieve in a single turn in Scrabble is for the word &quot;oxyphenbutazone&quot;. Even at the top levels of tournament Scrabble, this has never actually happened: it would require the game to have unfolded in exactly the right way up to that point, leaving exactly the right open spaces, and the right combination of letters in the bag. But if it did, it would span three triple-word scores, creating seven other new words on the board, for a total of at least 1,778, depending on which official word list you used. The closest anyone has come in real life was a now deceased Kurdish player, Dr Karl Khoshnaw, who got 392 points for &quot;caziques&quot; at a contest in Manchester in 1982....<br /><br />The official position is that Scrabble is 60 years old this year - though that&#039;s slightly debatable and, believe me, Scrabble experts are the kind of people who like to debate it at length - so one hot afternoon this month, I took a subway train to Jackson Heights in Queens, New York, to try to find its birthplace. According to Mattel, which owns the rights in most countries, more than 150 million Scrabble sets have been sold, in 29 different languages, since it first went on the market; 30,000 games are started somewhere in the world each hour. I thought Scrabble&#039;s ground zero might be covered in worshipful graffiti, like the Abbey Road street sign or Jim Morrison&#039;s grave in Paris. But at the apartment building where Alfred Butts, an architect forced out of work by the Great Depression, had made the first board on his kitchen table, there was nothing. At the Methodist church hall a few blocks away, on 35th Avenue, where he&#039;d tested different versions of the game on friends and neighbours, I&#039;d been told I&#039;d find a commemorative sign on which each letter of the word &quot;avenue&quot; had its Scrabble score displayed in the bottom right. But it was gone. Eventually, I found a tiny plaque on the side of the church annexe. It didn&#039;t feel like enough - but, as it turns out, Butts himself probably wouldn&#039;t have minded. He was a mild, undemanding man, and in any case, he was just glad Scrabble ever saw the light of day. Because it very nearly didn&#039;t.<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

				I know there was some talk about it previously, but it&#039;s been a while so I decided to go ahead and try to get a new sign put up at 35th and 81st to replace the commemorative Scrabble sign that was there until early last year. &nbsp;I called 311 and registered a request - even uploaded a picture to back it up. I think the only way to get it done would be for several people to also make a similar request. It&#039;s one of the (many!) things that makes JH unique and interesting; it would great to have the sign back!

				After several months of telephone calls to CB 3 ( a complete waste) and Daniel Dromms office to inquire about the&nbsp; missing Scrabble Street Sign designating the birthplace of &quot;Scrabble&quot;, I was finally told that the sign was illegal and removed because it was&nbsp; not approved by the D.O.T.&nbsp; I found this to be so ironic given the fact that there is so much illegal signage throughout JH&nbsp; especially in the Historic District. That they would choose to remove this particular sign which I felt to be rather charming and historically befitting is beyond reason.&nbsp; I had thought that the sign was place there by the NYC Landmark Commission and had remembered it being congruent with the street signs placed by the Landmarks Commission. Anyway, I was told if we want it replaced that we should contact Daniels Dromm&#039;s office to request that the sign be put back up.&nbsp; As with every thing, the more calls the better!&nbsp;

And there is â€” or rather was â€” the street sign that commemorated Jackson Heights as the birthplace of Scrabble. <br /><br />The brown street sign, in the style of signs in historic districts, used to mark the intersection of 35th Avenue and 81st Street, near where a former architect named Alfred Mosher Butts devised the crisscrossing word game in 1938. <br /><br />The sign denoted the Scrabble values of its letters, like so: 35T1H4 A1V4E1N1U1E1. <br /><br />People in the community were proud of the sign, erected in 1995, but it mysteriously disappeared in 2008.<br />(click link above for full article)<br />
