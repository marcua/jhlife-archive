				I went there earlier today and the first thing that I noticed were the pigeons perched under<br />the overpass, the second thing being the loud noise from the traffic on the BQE and this was around<br />midday so the traffic was light. Having 2 separate sections for large and small dogs is ok, but not much room to run around in either one. The benches were ok,but it would have been nice to have some small tables to go along with them. What do you think about it? I guess it&#039;s the best that they can do for now in Jackson Heights.

				Wow, I must say I am a little appalled at this post!! How sad.... It has taken a long time and a lot of work in order to get a dog run in JH! We live in NYC, land of the pigeons and while I agree the traffic may be loud I&#039;m pretty sure my dog doesn&#039;t care!! He is just happy to have a place of freedom, just like me!!!<br /><br />I by all means do not want to start drama (because it is annoying) but I just wanted to let you know how hard people worked and that we should be happy we have a park (a wonderful one in my opinion) at all!<br /><br />Have a great long weekend everyone!!

				Went to the dog run today. Thank you so much to everyone that got this in the works.<br /><br />Even though my dog is old and anti-social (not aggressive, just scared), it was great to get him outside and have a place for me to sit.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t really mind the highway noise (can&#039;t justify complaining, since I chose to live in NYC). Other dog owners there were very nice and friendly (unlike some of my non-pet owning neighbors).<br /><br />I just wish there was a way we could announce the dog run more. If only apartment complexes had bulletin boards...

				I think the dog run is great, and I don&#039;t even have a dog.&nbsp; It took a lot of imagination and vision to find a space in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I am very grateful to all those who were instrumental in getting it done. It adds another dimension to our neighborhood.

				We are loving the dog run. And think it&#039;s a frigging bargain in terms of the small donation suggested. What<br />do these people pay per month in dog food? Thanks god for the persistent types who finally got this thing up<br />and running. I wouldn&#039;t care if it was in the middle of the BQE! Our dog is different even in the short time<br />it&#039;s been going, due to the exercise she&#039;s finally getting right here in JH. Am thinking the negative posters<br />are new to community projects and construction work as I used to have same naivete.<br />&nbsp; The JHCRW is so worth it friends! Please support it...

				To everyone who loves and appreciates the park, we hope you will become involved in helping us maintain it.<br /><br />In response to peachy, snickers and the rest of your ilk, I have this to offer:<br /><br />First off, food is NOT allowed in the park and I&#039;m sure my fellow dog owners do not want to give the pigeons any ammunition. Secondly, the rat situation was much worse before the dog run was built and if anything, the run will prevent rats from colonizing that particular section since it&#039;s being utilized. No doubt dens already exist under and around the run, but with the maintenance and possible continued development of the area, the rat population will decrease. A much larger concern should be the taxi/gypsy cab drivers (and everyone else for that matter) who park along 69th Street and dump their trash along the sidewalk. <br /><br />I think what would be more helpful and beneficial is if JHBG would get the combination lock installed, as originally requested, to prevent the general public from using it/dumping their food garbage in the trash receptacles and getting CB3 to get NYC Sanitation to pick up our trash (also, as originally planned) twice/week. <br /><br />That being said, if you would like to help improve/maintain the dog run, as per our agreement with DOT, you can join our happy family at www.JHCREW.org<br /><br />Other helpful, constructive actions include:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; elect state officials that know how to balance a budget and appropriate funds for maintaining their properties<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; get involved with community groups, or create your own, to implement better strategies for dealing with community issues<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; talk/write your elected officials and GET INVOLVED in the process!<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to remind you that you live in NYC! Rats, Pigeons and Cockroaches are EVERYWHERE and part of everyday life! If you can&#039;t deal with pests and noise, perhaps you should consider moving somewhere else!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />â€œNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&#039;s the only thing that ever doesâ€ - M.

				My dog and I went there for the first time today. It was great and the dog had a blast. Thank you to those who made it happen. That space would have otherwise gone to waste.<br /><br />I noticed the wood chip ground cover was spilling out all over the sidewalk. Perhaps a wooden 2x4 as a curb at the gate would keep the chips in and the sidewalk clean. Other than that everything seemed great!

				just sayin that support is there for the dog run to be safe for all. the members need not feel any exclusivity as this is<br />an organization open to all to join (with some smaller restrictions) and giving the lock code out is not cool, really. thanks<br />again to those that worked their nads off to make this happen as we are lovin it and hope you don&#039;t have to be bad cop <br />too often.<br /><br />PS- is the bulletin board expected soon?

				If you actually believe that people aren&#039;t going to give out the lock code to their friends and <br />family then I have a bridge to sell you. Sounds like people have been having a hard time<br />getting in with the code since the lock has been installed. Makes you wonder if it was really worth it in the first<br />place. I sure hope a licensed and insured locksmith did the job.<br /><br />You can lock it at night,that is fine,unlock it early in the morning. A lot of people will not return when they see that it&#039;s<br />locked and I realize that you can&#039;t put up fliers on the gate,so they will assume it&#039;s closed for good.

				Yep, we do believe that if friends and others asked for the code it would not be given. If you care about your dog and the responsibility <br />that involves, you would weigh that over the quick fix of the moment that gives out the code to unregistered users. Not exactly worth<br />it in my book. Have seen some people that look pissed about not getting in but them&#039;s the rules. What do they tell the tax man? The <br />phone companies? The other city parks we&#039;ve been to this summer have super strict dog runs and if you are new you are INSPECTED<br />as no one wants trouble in their dog run. Should JH be any different? Some people went through hell and back just to get this thing<br />up and running.<br />&nbsp;How much is that bridge?

				We are still working to try to get some kind of bulletin board out front. We&#039;re not allowed to install anything without full approval. <br /><br />Also, membership is free and open to all - but for insurance purposes to be allowed to use the land, all dogs must have their vaccinations. (We have to insure ourselves - unlike dog runs on city parks properties, which use NYC&#039;s insurance). Anyone who doesn&#039;t have the code, just remind them that we&#039;re not charging - just making sure that the dogs inside have all their shots!

				It would be nice to let people know their status regarding the applications sent in. No delay in cashing<br />checks I see,hmm. I wonder why it takes so long to process the paperwork? What about the guy who&#039;s<br />dog got fleas from the dog run? Was that just an isolated incident,or is this going to happen again. A responsible<br />dog owner should apply flea and tick medicine to his or her dog every month year round.<br /><br />I can see mosquito&#039;s becoming a problem right after it rains.....

				I don&#039;t have a dog but I stroll my cat around the neighborhood. We&#039;re going to swing by and say hi to the dogs (from outside the fence, of course).

				For those that don&#039;t understand the &quot;membership thing&quot; and find it &quot;ridiculous,&quot; it serves 3 purposes.&nbsp; First, it is due to legal and liability reasons for insurance.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good thing in our litigation-happy society.&nbsp; Secondly, those who actually have a vet and vaccinate their dogs are generally the ones who care about their dogs and have socialized them well.&nbsp; It&#039;s actually a great idea, since any idiot can take his unruly dog to an unsecured, non-membership-based dog run.&nbsp; Thirdly, it creates a sense of ownership.&nbsp; Those who wish to go through the VERY SIMPLE process tend to be those who treat the park as if it were their own, and keep it neat, orderly, and maintained.&nbsp; Have you seen the sorry excuse for a dog run in Astoria?&nbsp; The place is falling apart.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what we would do without this place! It&#039;s just what my dog needed!&nbsp; So much space for him and many other of his large playmates!

				Oh, and who is this Snickers person, anyway?&nbsp; I want to make sure we don&#039;t have to look at him when we go to the park.&nbsp; I sure feel sorry for his dog.

				Just wanted to report that I saw two youths at the dog run on Saturday. One appeared to be climbing over the fence<br />as I was looking in the rear view mirror. I thought the dog might have been a pit bull but I think now it was the<br />one that was left and reclaimed over the weekend. Two boys under the age of twenty, slight builds, one with glasses.<br />And hands clapping for the cleanup crews this weekend too. Area looks great and you were all pretty on NY1!!!
