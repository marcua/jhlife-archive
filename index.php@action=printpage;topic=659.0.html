				Whiskey Bar was actually a cover of a piece by Kurt Weill in The Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahogany. I think Berthold Brecht wrote the lyrics.<br /><br />As for my favorites:<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell me you don&#039;t know what love is<br />When you&#039;re old enough to know better<br />When you find strange hands in your sweater<br /><br />-Elvis Costello<br /><br />Your everlasting summer<br />You can see it fading fast<br />So you grab a piece of something<br />That you think is gonna last <br /><br />-Steely Dan<br /><br />Gouge away you can gouge away<br /><br />- Pixies

				JohnPrester and Chuckster, that was great.&nbsp; It was too short though.&nbsp; I had to watch a video of <em>RUSH</em> playing the song just because 80s wasn&#039;t my thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;70s music was more my style.<br /><br />see if you guys know which band these lyrics come from.&nbsp; I think this may be too easy.&nbsp; no cheating and looking online either.&nbsp; :<br /><br />Well I&#039;m a human fly<br />I-I said F-L-Y<br />I say &quot;buzz buzz buzz&quot;<br />A-and it&#039;s just becuz<br />I-I&#039;m a human fly<br />A-and I don&#039;t know why<br />I got 96 tears and 96 eyes<br />

				yeah I knew Stop Your Sobbing was written by the Kinks. Chrissie Hynde dated Ray Davies when they did that song.&nbsp; But when I think of the song, I think Pretenders.&nbsp; I forgot who did Surfer Bird. A few bands covered that song but I love the Cramps version.&nbsp; Thanks for refreshing my memory with that one.<br /><br />Knew Dylan right away.&nbsp; Love Dylan lyrics.<br /><br />And I know I know Jesus died for somebody&#039;s sins but I&#039;m blanking so I&#039;m going to look it up.&nbsp; ***** Patti Smith!&nbsp; I have a signed book of her poetry from 1971.&nbsp; No wonder I kinda remembered but I&#039;m sleepy tonite.<br /><br />What&#039;s the I got a letter from the government from?

				Many of them have nice lyrics, but again, they&#039;re sad.<br /><br />Just once, by James Ingram<br /><br />By the way, while googling him, I noticed that Luis Miguel recorded this song.&nbsp; Now I&#039;ll have to listen to that version.&nbsp; I love Luis Miguel, particularly the songs from the Romantico series.

				Translation to NYC Native&#039;s posting on Gilbert Santa Rosa and his beautiful song<br /><br />Walking without her that way, without a firm destination, to take refuge as a child, in the arms of loneliness, returning without her is delirious, so hurtful, so frustrating that I do not want to return home.<br /><br />It is like having your hands full of her, of laughter, of her smile, her hips, and know that she is not around, it is like sitting and stripping the stars, under a new moon through a large window.<br /><br />To live without her is to be chained to that body that I love, <br />it&#039;s to be afraid of the solitude,<br />to live without her is to render to each instant<br />it&#039;s the fall, it&#039;s the pick and for her the start.<br /><br />This is not normal,<br />it&#039;s wanting to fly to where she is,<br /><br />This is not normal,<br />it&#039;s wanting to fly to where she is,<br /><br />The night without her is a bitter drink,<br />it&#039;s a stare at the calendar<br />it&#039;s a cry, friends, a cry.<br />
