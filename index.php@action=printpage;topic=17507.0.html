				To see all the great pictures, please see my post on craiglist: newyork.craigslist.org/que/roo/d/900-bedroom-in-wonderful/6481954083.html<br /><br />-Looking for a February 15 or March 1 move-in date.<br /><br />-Electricity and internet run approximately $65-70 per person per month<br /><br />-If you are a couple, the rent will be $1500 ($750 per person), and you will have first priority in the living room and can use it as a dressing room, study space, store some of your stuff there, etc.&nbsp; Rent cost for couples *includes internet and electricity* (as long as total electricity bill for the apartment does not exceed $60/month...it&#039;s typically been about $50/month).<br /><br />-Full apartment, even without counting the abundant outdoor space, is about 900-1000 square feet.<br /><br />-The bedroom is about 150 square feet, comes with closet, window, overhead fan.<br /><br />-Option to have the bedroom semi-furnished (fold out futon bed, desk, chair, two sets of wooden bookshelves) or unfurnished. <br /><br />-Six to ten minutes walk to 74th St/Jackson Heights/Roosevelt Ave subway hub (E,F,7,R,M trains); it&#039;s about 30 minutes to the MoMA/midtown, door to door. Walking distance to excellent and inexpensive restaurants of many national cuisines.&nbsp; Walking distance to grocery stores and other shopping, and great live music place (Terraza 7). Laundromat three blocks away.<br /><br />-Private room.&nbsp; Share with leaseholder the bathroom, living room, spacious modern kitchen, storage space, and backyard (with deck, hammock, and trees).<br /><br />-Living room has projector and blank wall for showing movie-sized movies.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Leaseholder (that&#039;s me) is laid-back college professor at CUNY only around a little more than half the week (my significant other lives elsewhere so I visit her regularly and she also visits regularly).<br /><br />-$900 deposit with first month&#039;s rent, to be returned less than 2 weeks after you move out, as long as the sublettor agreement terms have been respected.<br />
