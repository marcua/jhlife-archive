				Must have been something in the air. You had the most influential Punk Guitarist of all time from 77 street ..the one and only John Anthony Genzale, Jr aka Johnny Thunders from the New York Dolls . Also from the Dolls you&nbsp; had the original drummer Billy Murcia..from my side of Roosevelt Ave. Gene Simmons of Kiss as well. Had a buddy tell me Bruce Kulick also of Kiss was a Heights boy. I know the famous Irish musician Tommy Makem of the Clancy Brothers lived on Hampton Street in the 60&#039;s<br />Anyone i&#039;m missing ?

				Just saw a PBS special on Tommy Makem touring Ireland.&nbsp; I remember seeing him often at Mass at St. Bart&#039;s on Ithaca Street in Elmhurst in the late 50s and 60s.&nbsp; Also, regarding Gene Simmons, I believe he graduated from Newtown High School.

				Yeah, see my Post on Celebrities dated today. I think Brian Setzer of the Stray Cats went to PS 145 with me (he didn&#039;t live in Jackson Heights though) and Sylvain Sylvain of the Dolls (who I wasn&#039;t really into) was in I think my 3rd of 4th grade class at PS 69, I didn&#039;t like him!<br /><br />Johnny Thunders actually played &quot;Walk Don&#039;t Run&quot; at the PS 145 talent show and was really good and once complimented me on my Beatle Boots! <br /><br />Simmons actually live across from me- I never spoke to him though as his face frightened me- imagine a 12 year old with that same face! I never liked Kiss.<br /><br />Louie Armstrong I believe live on the cusp in Carona.
