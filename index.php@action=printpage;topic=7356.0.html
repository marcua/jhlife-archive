				That hideous shack that they had added onto the 75th Street side of the store IS GONE!!!!<br />It seems that it came down this morning. And I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t because THEY decided it was&nbsp; an eyesore, and generally blocking the sidewalk.<br /><br />Does anyone know the real story and who we have to thank?

				it was built/added without permission and in violation of zoning....but, unlike a lot of manhattan bigwigs who add ten stories to their buildings aganist zoning, then say &#039;well, we can&#039;t take them off now,&#039; they were forced to do the right thing. i&#039;m not sure exactly who pitched in, but thanks to them!<br /><br />

				From City Council Member Daniel Dromm:<br />&nbsp;<br />The Jackson Heights community proved today that you canâ€™t break the law and get away with it. Just hours ago, the Trade Fair Supermarket demolished the illegal sidewalk enclosure that was blocking pedestrian access on 75th Street. Many residents had feared that the enclosure was a fire hazard.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />â€œI am glad that Trade Fair has finally complied with the law. I know that many in the community will be relieved that their calls, letters, and emails have been successful in forcing Trade Fair to be a responsible neighbor,â€ said Council Member Daniel Dromm (D-Queens). â€œSidewalks are public property. And no one person or business can take advantage and just take for their own use what is owned by the people of our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this be a warning to other businesses in the neighborhood who might think they can break the law and get away with it. A new day has come.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />In August of 2011 a partial vacate order was issued by the Department of Buildings (DOB) to Trade Fair for the illegal extension citing dangerous conditions and improper construction. &nbsp;When Trade Fair management failed to comply with DOB order, the Environment Control Board issued a violation.<br />&nbsp;<br />After scores of complaints from community members, Council Member Dromm held a rally with neighborhood residents in January of this year to highlight Trade Fairâ€™s outrageous behavior. The rally was widely covered in the press.<br />&nbsp;<br />Click here to see the coverage on NY1 News. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCwKwRqULq8&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCwKwRqULq8&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)<br /><br />â€œWe have a process for getting a sidewalk enclosure. We have a system of rules and regulations that everyone must follow - including businesses,â€ Dromm continued. â€œI hope that Trade Fair will take this opportunity to start a new relationship with the community - one that is based on respect and cooperation.â€<br />&nbsp;<br />Dromm also thanked the Department of Buildings (DOB) for doing a great job and looks forward to working closely with DOB on correcting other violations in the community.

				Now if we coulld only stop other stores from extending their stores out onto the sidewalk. There is a store adjacent to the C town that looks like a circus and blasts music from speakers.&nbsp;

				Didn&#039;t realize that it was illegal for them to be out on the sidewalk like that. &nbsp;My first thought when I saw that the section came down was &quot;where are they going to put all the chips now?!&quot; &nbsp;The store is crowded enough as it is.<br /><br />Now to get them to stop charging higher than the posted (ha!) prices and not to sell expired food - that should be where efforts are concentrated.

				There is still a potential problem there.<br /><br />Under the awning, is a dropped eggcrate ceiling. Some of the sections are missing so it&#039;s just perfect for pigeons to start nesting. Either they fill in the misssing pieces or remove it all.<br /><br />See above &quot;after&quot; picture with Danny Dromm.

				It is great to have a grocery store with every possible ethnic food in the world. But perhaps if they cut it down a bit, they wouldn&#039;t need to sell food out on the street. They should focus more on quality instead of quantity.

				Speaking of which.....that too is a violation not to mention&nbsp; their canopy. The food outside should extend no more than 12 inches from the store.&nbsp; Trade Fair extends theirs a lot further.
