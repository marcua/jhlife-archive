					I have a whole box of baseball, football and some Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom cards.&nbsp; They are in good condition, as I tossed anything ragged.&nbsp; They aren&#039;t particularly valuable (I saved my beloved Mookie Wilson card for myself) and I doubt it could be sold for more than a couple of bucks (literally), but it sure would be nice if someone who likes cards can have them rather then them going in the trash.

					Our co-op is kicking around the idea of putting in some bike storage in our generally underutilized basement common room.&nbsp; We are a 16 unit co-op and it is pretty clear that to create a bike storage of 16 bikes would be unwieldy and perhaps not even fully used.&nbsp; So if one is put in, it would be for less than 16 bikes, thereby meaning that not every unit would get an allocated space.&nbsp; If this is the case, would it be considered normal to charge a fee for this and if so, how much would be appropriate?&nbsp; It feels odd to charge for bike storage, but there could be a fairness issue.&nbsp; Presently, all units have an allocated storage room and no fee is charged.&nbsp; We have garages, but only those high enough on the senority list get them and for such a fee is paid.<br /><br />Plus, if anyone is in a building that does have bike storage, it would be great to know what type of storage system is used and how well that is working out.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

					<strong>Sofa:&nbsp; Rory Microfiber Queen Sized Sofa, Raymour &amp; Flanigan for $1,100.&nbsp; &nbsp;Selling for $200.</strong><br /><br />On one of the cushions, there is a bleach stain, so the cushion case will have to be changed for perfection.&nbsp; Otherwise it is a great sofa with an easy to pull out queen bed.&nbsp; One of the comfiest sofa beds I&#039;ve slept on.&nbsp; The bed itself was used exactly 7 times.&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://www.raymourflanigan.com/rory-microfiber-queen-sleeper-sofa-260283759.aspx" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.raymourflanigan.com/rory-microfiber-queen-sleeper-sofa-260283759.aspx</a><br /><br /><strong>Frigidare 8000 BTU Portable Air Conditioner.&nbsp; Bought for $329, selling for $50.</strong><br /><br />A good cooling unit, will cool a single room (our room 13&#039;x15&#039;) well.&nbsp; The connection from the hose to the window is flimsy, though that flimsy connection makes it very easy to attach and remove to your window, so you can have both the a/c and your window when you want it.&nbsp; We only used the a/c at night, so whenever we used it, I&#039;d disconnect it in the morning, takes 30 seconds at most.&nbsp; Frankly, I wouldn&#039;t ever buy it (again) for $329, but I&#039;d buy it for $50.&nbsp; We bought it 3 years ago, used it about 20 times (we are not huge a/c folks).&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, and its also on wheels!<br /><br />Sofa plus a/c unit = $225 sale!<br /><br /><strong>French Door Refrigerator with water dispenser and ice maker, $200</strong><br /><br />The co-op we bought came with a huge french door stainless steel in black cabinet refrigerator.&nbsp; I have no idea of the actual size, but its dimensions are 69&quot; high, 36&quot; wide, 30&quot; deep.&nbsp; I reckon between 23 and 26 cubic feet.&nbsp; The person b4 us actually left the protective tape on the fridge, so when you look at it, it appears scuffed, but pull off the tape and its perfect.&nbsp; Its a lovely fridge, but its just too overpowering for our small kitchen.<br />(Pictures to come)<br /><br /><strong>GE 4 burner gas range, 30&quot;.&nbsp; Free.</strong><br /><br />Its white and it works well.&nbsp; Its definitely a victim of an overzealous brillo welder.&nbsp; We just plan on replacing it and if someone wants it instead of the home depot folks taking it away when they bring the new one, they are welcome to it!<br /><br /><strong>White Hood fan, free if taken with range.</strong><br />Again, its white, its old and its seen better days, but it&#039;s a double fan and it works just fine.&nbsp; We are going to replace it and would prefer to see it reused than at the dump.<br /><br />The fridge, range and air conditioner can be taken at any time, the sofa is a mid to late September thing.&nbsp; Everything is priced well because I&#039;m more interested in getting rid of it and recycling it and also because while I can totally help you move anything to the street, you are going to have to provide your own transportation for it, or we can negotiate something out for me to get a truck for it (moving the couch or stove is a 2 person job, the refrigerator is a 3 person job).&nbsp; We are located in the mid 80&#039;s historic Jackson Heights.&nbsp;

					Being that Leo&#039;s ain&#039;t in JH, it might not properly belong in this forum, but had I read about it here 4 years ago instead of finding it last month on a whimsical decison to turn up 104th street during a run along Corona Avenue, all those years of shlepping out to Astoria for my Italian foods could have been saved (no offense Italian Farms).<br /><br />Aside from bagels, the only food theme where I unabashedly wear the rank of food snob is Italian food (e.g. I think all bbq is fantastic!).&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#039;s why I was so damned happy that when I asked for caciocavaddu out of habit, they knew exactly what I was talking about.&nbsp; And they backed it up: it had the perfect moisture, perfect taste and perfect texture, as good as you are going to find outside of sicily). Their mozzarella is also wonderful and their breads are solid and so far at the bakery next door, I&#039;ve had their rum/cannoli cake, eclairs, cannolis and fruit tarts, all of which were excellent.&nbsp; We are going to order a proper Sicilian Cassata from them in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />But two things set it apart:<br />First, they have a supercute outdoor backyard, replete with white painted metal chairs, rose bushes, water fountain and a fresco painting splashed across the back wall.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth it to go there to just soak in a piece of quickly disappearing history on Corona.&nbsp; Serene and lovely.<br /><br />Second, when my wife and I left the bakery today, we peeked inside the windows of the latticini (it&#039;s closed on sundays).&nbsp; As we were looking at the macaronis, one of the women sitting in the chairs nearby got up and said hello.&nbsp; It was the owner.&nbsp; The family still lives upstairs and they wile away their sundays old school, hanging out in front their shop. We chit chatted a bit, found out that they sell their sandwiches at Shea during ballgames.&nbsp; It was just so freakin nice to see that that sort of thing hasn&#039;t completely disappeared from the days of our parents.<br /><br />Anyways, give it a go atleast once.&nbsp; It disturbed us that we were the only ones today enjoying the delicous (and cheap) pastries and coffee in the yard.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want a place like that to disappear.<br /><br />

					We are close to submitting our application to buy shares into a co-op in JH.&nbsp; We have everything we need except for the letter from the landlord which the application also requires.&nbsp; Our problem is that we live in a building whose offices are located in Manhattan (though you send rent checks to a place in Queens) and when you call their offices, they won&#039;t even give you their last names or direct extensions, let alone taking the time to write a letter on our behalf.&nbsp; Phone calls to their offices, even when there is some urgency to them, are never responded to.&nbsp; We are on very good terms with our building&#039;s superintendent and he has agreed to write a letter for us.<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone has went through the same.&nbsp; Would the super&#039;s letter be fine or are we to a small degree screwed?&nbsp; Any other way around this?

					After getting our ducks in order, having that potential of a 30% down payment and 2 years liquid backup,&nbsp; we are finally ready to buy a place.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been renting in the JH for some years now (me since 2010, my wife since 2007) and happily decided that the JH is where we can see ourselves staying for the long haul.<br /><br />When interviewing a broker (surely we shine a greenish hue) we were presented with the concept of a buyer broker.&nbsp; Now as much as I wouldn&#039;t want to directly pay a commish as a buyer, I can see the merit by having an experienced player being my specific advocate in what will be the biggest purchase of my life (unless my hip hop career finally takes off).&nbsp; So I wanted to ask if anyone on the boards has had experience using a buyer broker.&nbsp; What are the pros and cons?&nbsp; What should a good BB be willing to do for me?&nbsp; Is it unreasonable of me to ask for a BB to present a wealth of data showing price activities, maintenance comparisons and reports on how well (or unwell) certain co-op boards swab their ships?&nbsp; Does having one open up more pocket listings or close them off?&nbsp; What about with properties that will not co-broke?&nbsp; Is my paying their commission open those up, or does the exclusivity agreement make it so that I am effectively shut out of such?&nbsp; Will not having one just result in broker who would would be willing to steer us to a low grade choice just to quickly make their buck?&nbsp; <br /><br />And as a side bar, we went to an imprompt showing at Linden Court.&nbsp; The realtor showing mentioned a special 30 year assessment of 330, to be on top of the 760 maintenance and said it was &quot;pretty much normal&quot; on a 2 bedroom.&nbsp; Now I just smiled and nodded as my BS bells chimed away, but I wondered if seriously high special assessments an occupational hazard in venerable developments like Linden Court?&nbsp; Such a shame should it be if such was so, as they are so pretty and I always thought being forced to take the stairs was a window to a longer life.&nbsp; <br /><br />And by the way, should you know of a good 2BR or corpulent JR4.....&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />

					Howdy,<br /><br />Recently moved into Jackson Heights. &nbsp;So first off, hello everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking for a place to buy Frisee around here. &nbsp;The following places do not have it (atleast when I went there. &nbsp;I&#039;ve only been looking for this for the past two weeks):<br /><br />The small vegetable guys on 37th Avenue &nbsp;(@85th, 81st and the ones by the MET Supermarket)<br />The MET supermarket on 37th.<br />Compare Foods on Northern<br />C-Town at 37th &amp; 85th<br />Mi Tierra on Roosevelt<br />Bravo Foods on Roosevelt<br />Trade Fair on 37th and 88th<br />The fruit shop on 90th Street just off Roosevelt<br />The markets on 37th Avenue and 73rd Street.<br />The supermarket on 74th Street between 37th and Roosevelt.<br />The Farmers Market on Sunday at Travers Park.<br /><br />I am getting that feeling that I am answering my own question, but I&#039;d hope to not have to hump into the city to get it.<br /><br />Anyone know where I can find it around here or nearby (Flushing, Woodside et cetera)?<br /><br />Thanks!
