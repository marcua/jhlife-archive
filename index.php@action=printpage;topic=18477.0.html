				Just learned from potential contractor that we must move out for about two months in order to not harm lungs or furniture and get renovation done efficiently -- whenever we do this in the spring.&nbsp; What have you done in this situation or would you, or do you recommend?&nbsp; I&#039;m sick about this.&nbsp; Love my home and customarily cook every night, cannot eat in restaurants for two months.&nbsp; Short stay apartment?&nbsp; Is there such in Queens?&nbsp; Can&#039;t vagabond among friends&#039; couches.&nbsp; Could we find a spare room in Jackson Heights maybe with kitchen privileges?

				If you find a solution or have any updates on how things work out, please share.<br />I face same hurdle to doing renovations in my apartment too... And that has kept me from doing the work I want to do.<br />It&#039;s one of those times that homeowners who can move to one part of the house have us beat!!!!

				air bnb has whole apartment listings available by the week or month, and partial apartments (with kitchen use). the less pricey ones are probably actually in east elmhurst or elmhurst but maybe worth a glance?

				I just took a look out of curiosity for air bnb for Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Most for rent are rooms with shared bath.&nbsp; However, a furnished studio with kitchen and bath (no sharing) is about $90 a night.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure this price would be significantly reduced for a 2 month stay especially in an off season time of the year like January &amp; February.&nbsp; You have nothing to lose by offering 1/2 price.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
