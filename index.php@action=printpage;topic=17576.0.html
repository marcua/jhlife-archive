				Hi Everyone!<br /><br />I have a vintage, wool, chinese rug that I would like to get cleaned the old way- at a facility, cold water, ph shampoo etc.., Anyway, most of the places I have found in the area only do steam cleaning in house. I have called a few places in midtown but of course the price is exorbitant. I did find a a good place in Jersey- but obviously would rather stay in queens.<br /><br />If you know of any business that can clean a rug like this (also called one in astoria which was $600 vs. the $250 in Jersey), then please send the information my way! <br /><br />Thank you!!! ;D

				i&#039;ve used this place once or twice, and had reasonably good results. i haven&#039;t done so in a while, though, and i don&#039;t know what their prices are like. my guess would be somewhere between those price points. they were $250 or so back in 2012.<br /><br />http://www.majesticrugcleaningnewyork.com/

				It&#039;s not Queens but have you looked at Carpet Culture on Broome St?<br /><br />Personally have not had to use them but I&#039;ve looked into buying Rugs from him, and his customer service and knowledge is top notch. Just from the less than an hour I&#039;ve spent with him i&#039;d trust him with something like Carpet cleaning.<br />

				I recently used Majestic, and it was an easy process.&nbsp; For three rugs, our cost was $550.&nbsp; They came and picked up on a Friday, and then returned the following Friday.&nbsp; If you like you can order new carpet pads, and they will be cut to size.&nbsp; Also if you order the pads, they will re-lay the carpets.&nbsp; <br />We are so happy with the results.&nbsp; The cleaning was overdue...&nbsp; now we are considering them for upholstery cleaning...&nbsp; <br />

				I have hired Kosker Rugs a couple of times over the years for cleaning my Turkish carpets. I believe they use the method you describe. My carpets are vintage and wool and was happy with the result. https://traditionalrugrepair.com/
