				&nbsp;:&#039;( <br /><br />Maybe a stupid question, but I&#039;ve had 2 waterbugs in my apt in the past month. I know the hot weather brings out all these insects and bugs. but where exactly do the waterbugs come from? Are they coming from the radiator? I can&#039;t seem to think of any other openings they could be coming from. I absolutely despise those things!

				You mean American Cockroach right?&nbsp; (Landlords always seem to call them waterbugs so they sound better)<br />I hate them too but I console myself with the fact that they reproduce slower than the little german roaches so you don&#039;t get as big of an infestation even though they are larger. <br /><br />I seal everything, around floorboards, around pipes, anywhere there is a crack.&nbsp; Don&#039;t leave standing water anywhere, if you go on a trip, pour ammonia down the drains before you leave so there isn&#039;t standing water.&nbsp; Vacuum often.&nbsp; If you notice a particular area that they always seem to come to, put out poison.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also if I notice bugs of any type always showing up in the same areas in addition to the above I wipe it all down really well with rubbing alcohol to try to erase any residue or markers they may be leaving.&nbsp; I hate hate hate having to make contact to kill them so I keep rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle to kill them, I don&#039;t have to squish them and I don&#039;t have to breathe raid, simply sweep up a perfectly preserved body with no guts to wipe up.

				Chuckster,<br /><br />I feel exactly the same way about those awful creatures.&nbsp; If a video was made of me upon spotting one in my apartment, it would be quite funny - to everyone but me.&nbsp; I have actually been reduced to tears and hysteria, throwing heavy books at them from the adjoining room and leaving the book that eventually hits its mark for days before I have the nerve to lift the book up and flush the carcass.<br /><br />They come up from the basement or from outside (You see them outside in hot and humid weather and they can FLY!!!)&nbsp; Check under sinks and stoves, where pipes come up, and fill in any space.&nbsp; Check base boards to see if there is enough room for them to come from behind a wall.&nbsp; They can crawl from the incinerator room down the hall and under your door.&nbsp; Make sure there is not enough space under the door or, alternately, put a rug over the crack during sumemr months.<br /><br />I like the idea of using rubbing alcohol because I don&#039;t keep pesticides and, with pets around, I would not use them.<br /><br />In Florida they call them Palmetto Bugs.&nbsp; Now doesn&#039;t that sound like a cute little bug?

				ohhhh I hate, hate, HATE when they fly. thats the stuff of nightmares!&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve definitely shed tears during waterbug duels.... a couple summers ago I kept finding them when I went home so I would convince the guy I was dating to go up to my 3rd floor walk-up and make sure it was clear.&nbsp; He was the type to just pick them up in a napkin, I would get freaked out just watching him get that close to one. <br /><br />I have jumped up on the kitchen counter while pouring alcohol on the floor to kill one. I probably almost killed myself, I was leaning very precariously and was barely awake.&nbsp; &nbsp;LOL<br /><br />I once was packing up my nieces and nephews to come spend the weekend with me,&nbsp; their parents had already gone for the day and I found one in their kitchen... the best thing I could find nearby was a pair of my brother&#039;s dress shoes... I dropped one on the bug and called and left him a message telling him what to find underneath. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had panic attacks just sweeping up a dead one.... I think I&#039;m over that now but uuuughhhh ::shudder::<br /><br />Rubbing alcohol is really great for it, sanitizes the area and isn&#039;t a hazard like so much else.<br /><br /><br />I really love this thread, I don&#039;t feel so alone in my fear anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				funny, my roommate and I had a conversation this morning about how her boyfriend will hide behind her if there is a bug (she is also terrified).&nbsp; since I was a young teen I&#039;ve stated many times that the main thing I required in a boyfriend is that he will kill the bugs and take out the garbage for me.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />They could come up via the radiators.&nbsp; They like water pipes, they can feed on anything but they need moisture.&nbsp; Make sure everything is dry and if you have cracks around anything, pump some caulk or sealing foam in it.<br /><br />

				It is possible that they are coming in through the opening surrounding the radiator pipes. They may also be coming up from inside the drain pipes in your kitchen sink, bathtub, and bathroom sink. The drainpipe in the kitchen sink is a big culprit for roaches entering since 1) it connects to other apartments providing a nice highway for roaches to travel between your apartment and your pigsty neighbors 2) it often has food particles decaying in it from the dirty dishes, food preparation, etc. 3) it has plenty of H2O for roaches to drink. Get a stainless steel kitchen sink drain stopper that allows water to drain but won&#039;t allow food to go down the drain (it also won&#039;t let roaches up). I would get rubber stoppers for the bathroom sink and tub as well although they are less popular with roaches than kitchen drains. Any water drain pipe is a roach party zone so I would put stops in them all when you are not using them. <br /><br />Secondly,&nbsp; Go to the hardware store and get acrylic painters caulk and a caulking gun. These items are not expensive. Then, go back to your apartment - caulk, caulk, and caulk some more. Roaches love cracks, crevices, nooks and crannies. They can fit through 1/4 inch spaces so go around the edge of the rooms where the floor meets the walls (or molding). Go around where the windows meet the walls. Check for any holes in the walls, ceiling, or floors; even if they are only the size of a dime, they are big enough for a roach to fit through. Fix and holes with spackel . <br /><br />Lastly, get spray foam and spray around any pipes that are entering your apartment, including your radiator pipe. Make sure the foam can be used on hot pipes.Spray around the plumbing pipes, drain pipes, radiator pipes - any pipe that has a gap between itself and sheetrock/plaster surrounding it will let roaches in.<br />&nbsp;

				The other night I screamed and launched across the couch, over my husband, past his laptop and scurried over the arm of the couch to avoid one that was on the lampshade next to me. Still gives me shivers! Gross. I hate them, and I feel like there&#039;s been more than usual this summer...

				oh, thank god. i feel like i&#039;ve just found a support group for people who despise/dread water bugs.<br /><br />What buildings are you guys in (so i know to never purchase an apartment in them)?<br />I&#039;m at the colonial court on 76th street. The building itself is hot and humid. I mean seriously tropical. My apartment is at least 10 degrees hotter than outside. This has to contribute to these suckers thriving like they do.<br /><br />But this is the most disturbing part. I&#039;ve lived on the other side of roosevelt avenue, y&#039;know the less cleanly, stinky part of the nieghborhood and for all the little roaches that you&#039;d come across, I hardly ever came across waterbugs!!!!<br />I bought into Jackson Heights proper thinking i&#039;m moving up in the barrio, only to find WATERBUGGS!?

				Now that&#039;s where having a diligent Super comes in - keeping them at bay in the basement, before they have a change to stroll up to the higher floors in the warmer weather.<br /><br />It also helps a lot of you fill in all possible entry points in your apartment.

				&nbsp;water bug sits on the surface of the water in a swimming pool. It can detect and process the slightest ripples in that pool into an bug idea about the pool. First however it must have an bug idea of the pool water without any detectable ripples, most likely defined by a state of calm. It must have a buggy sense of no detection in order to detect anything. Another water bug sits on the surface of the water in another swimming pool. On the other side of this pool is a small fountain that is constantly on and has been since before the bug hatched. The bug regards the ripples from the fountain as calm and can still detect the slight ripples that deviate from this calm.

He probably thinks they&#039;re are just a minor nuisance. <br /><br />I&#039;ve contacted management directly, but the manager is dismissive claiming that waterbugs (big roaches) only come out when it rains. I get the feeling the super is downplaying how prevalent they are. They do the bare minimum of having an exterminator come once a month and think that should be enough. <br /><br />It&#039;s so frustrating. What the hell is the big deal with them putting glue traps in the incinerator and all over the basement. I&#039;ve taken to doing it myself for the incinerator shoot on my floor.

Using essential oils like tea tree and peppermint and eucalyptus with vinegar and water. <br /><br />Fortunately/unfortunately our apartment building runs a minimum 10 degrees hotter than the actual weather, so in the summer time the apartments get very humid. The hallways are cooler. The roaches come up through pipes and radiators in the hallway, elevator shaft and incinerators and immediately want to go into the mugginess of the apartments. <br /><br />If they were handled in the basement, there would be far fewer making it to the 6th floor. I&#039;ve taken to putting glue traps in the incinerator and am going to mix boric acid with a filler to sprinkle around the floor. Unbelievable that I need to do this and that management sees anything beyond a once-a-month visit from the exterminator as too much of a hassle.

				Eucalyptus oil is toxic to cats so be careful if you&#039;ve got fur babies. We got a huge pack of glue traps and have them in a few places in the kitchen and bathroom.

Plus I&#039;ve mainly stuck to tea tree oil and am now switching to Peppermint oil. Here is why. It turns out that on the show DEXTER, which contained a lot of movie blood, the special fx team came up with their own concoction for fake blood. Their recipe included peppermint oil because when they filmed outside they needed to keep insects away from the movie blood, which contains syrup. Worked like a charm. Should work for roaches as well. <br /><br />Also a glass salter shaker filled with 70% isopropyl alcohol and a few piece of clove with cotton stuffed in the opening is recommended by a guy in some south east asian country. If it works in a hot, muggy, jungle country, I&#039;ll take it.
