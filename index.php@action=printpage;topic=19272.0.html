				I won&#039;t claim to be an expert on Indian food, but I love chicken tikka masala.&nbsp; The Jackson Diner has the worst chicken tikka masala I have ever had.&nbsp; I tried it on three separate occasions before I found a recipe and started making it on my own.

				i went there long before i moved to the neighborhood...1985/86, perhaps, back when it was in the space now occupied by Al Naimat. i thought it was better then, but i didn&#039;t have as much grounding in Indian food. i still find it good and reliable, though not spectacularly good.

				A few years ago at Jackson Diner, the people at the table next to me finished their meal and left. A waiter came over, took one of the used napkins from the table, dipped it into one of the water glasses the people had been drinking from and wiped off the table. He then sat new people at the table to eat. I have not been back since.

				Since its been in business for at least 45 years, I would imagine many of its customers are former Jackson Heights residents and Tourists who have been visiting for decades who return for nostalgia and not so much for the quality of the food.&nbsp;

				No, but the people who prepare your food likely use those filthy bathrooms, or employee bathrooms which are likely worse.
