				Thanks for sharing this. It&#039;s discouraging to hear about these changes to the plan that are under discussion. I&#039;m such a huge fan of the 78th street closure and park expansion, that I&#039;d hate to see it modified to accommodate Koeppel. If Northern has gotten a little better over the past few years, it sure wasn&#039;t because of the car dealerships.

				I used to take my child to the Garden School and have to walk past the dealer&#039;s business.&nbsp; The cars that drive around that 78th Street area, not just the dealer, are a danger to the children nearby.&nbsp; They have no regard for the kids.&nbsp; Some of the cars would literally block off the entire crosswalk forcing parents to walk around them and towards Northern Blvd.&nbsp; Things were so bad that they would have to have cops parked there during the morning and afternoon.&nbsp; It is no accident that the dealer recently reconstructed the building with the intention of maintaining access to 78th Street.&nbsp; We, as a neighborhood, should not let them do this.&nbsp; If anything, we should demand that the City, by eminent domain, take over the space and increase Travers Park&#039;s footprint.

As far as people dropping their kids off with cars, Travers is a neighborhood park and I would estimate that probably 98% of the people who use the park live within walking distance and walk to the park.&nbsp; In terms of dropping off and picking people off, if the entire block were taken over, I am sure that a small drop-off/pick-up area could be incorporated.&nbsp;

				This is crazy nonsense. That driveway on 78th was used for over 30 years for access to the garage by Toyota. They moved to the BQE and sold the property to Koeppel. At no time can the city take that driveway without closing the dealership. The business has done nothing wrong accept operate a legitimate car showroom and repair shop.

				does the dealership actually *own* that stub of land/concrete? if so, i agree with JK in opposing eminent domain. i was displaced by it three decades ago and i still have a chip on my shoulder about that. but if the claim is they&#039;ve &quot;always used&quot; a stretch of public land, well, they can stop using it now. anyone know the details on that?

				&nbsp;There are some other hidden agendas here that seem to be coming out. The Koeppel Mazda fight looks like it won&#039;t be won so there will be some capitulations here but the other folks- Rainbowland and Garden Schools will both be squeezed here in the name of community activism. Kids lose. Strongly suspect someone involved here is running for election of some sort. Would love to see names so they can be referenced in the future. This is very fishy stuff going on at this late date in many people&#039;s opinion.<br /><br />&nbsp;Eminent domain is a nasty thing and it can take all forms when people have hidden agendas- little guys lose!

				&nbsp;Sure. There is a protest scheduled for this weekend so the peoples involved will be there I assume. And then if they are running for office soon you can see if this is added to their &quot;accomplishments&quot;. This will be the reference. And are you reading here on JH Life with some peoples who are opposed to this inset being taken away after being constructed in full view of the public?

				The community was involved in the original planning of the park. The community was for all of 78th St closed.<br />That&#039;s what the original plan shows.<br /><br />Was the community consulted in the decision to use a part of 78th St for cars?<br /><br />I am guessing the community would say...NO.

				It was a great thing for the community to come together and decide to close the street.&nbsp; It was a beautiful thing for our elected officials and the city to come to the table with a park design and funding that integrated the street and the park.&nbsp; &nbsp;But all of this visioning and community consensus doesn&#039;t have a legal leg to stand on against the pre-existing property rights of the dealership.&nbsp; The access to that property via its driveway cannot be taken away without compensation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now that there&#039;s a brand new building on the site that relies on this driveway, I think the only way that street will ever be closed is if the city just purchases the whole site (at great expense).&nbsp; Personally, I have no problem with eminent domain for commercial properties, and I would love to see the city take this property and expand Travers Park, as community advocates were pushing for years ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				That is not a new building but a increase in the height of an old building. The garage door on the side on 78 has not moved and might be the same door that was there for years. Who wants a park next to the noise of Northern BLVD?

				i agree with you, JK, about the right of the business to carry on as it has been -- the dealership isn&#039;t doing anything new, the building isn&#039;t new, the planners knew this was there. seems pretty simple.<br /><br />but in terms of &quot;who wants a park right next to the noise of Northern?,&quot; many, if not most of, smaller NYC parks abut busy, noisy streets. heck, Flushing Meadow Park abuts Roosevelt.

				Keep cars out of our park? That’s crazy. The dealership has been there along with the garage side entrance for decades. The city can’t just close a street to cars and say to Koeppel and the Garden school that you can’t use the garages. The city would have to pay for such a taking of land use. The value of the property for commercial purposes is less. You also don’t know if the 77th street entrance would work.

				<span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size"> From Jackson Heights Green Alliance, I&#039;ll be there and will bring my family. Please come along if you can:<br /><br /><strong>Join us on Saturday March 30th at 11AM in Travers Park for a rally to keep Travers Park safe.</strong><br /><br />A new car dealership, Koeppel Mazda, recently opened at the corner of 78th Street and Northern Blvd and it built a car service entrance on 78th Street where Travers Park is to be expanded. We have been informed that this car service entrance is going to prevent the NYC Department of Parks from giving the Jackson Heights community the car-free park redesign that you were promised. <br /><br />The plans below clearly show the new park extending all of the way to Northern Boulevard, creating a safe space for our children that would be free of motor vehicles.<br /><br />Since the car dealership opened, we now have a constant flow of traffic on the street, quite often driving into the park to perform u-turns, showing complete disregard for the safety of everyone who uses the space.<br /><br />As the community group that worked most closely with the Jackson Heights community to create this space we have repeatedly heard how important it is for us to have a completely car-free environment in our park. This failure by the city to fulfill that promise is unacceptable to us.<br /><br />Join us this Saturday and let Koeppel know that we want to keep Travers Park Safe!<br /><br /></span>

				Well, itsit, I guess I won’t see you there. But in a parkless place like here, every inch matters. And in this case, we’re also talking about safety for kids playing. It seems terribly misplaced that yet another car dealership in northern could win over the interest of an entire community. Especially when that dealership is brand new to the area and was renovated long after the plans for the park had been announced. Why didn’t the dealership owner think of that in his design? Why would the interest of one business get priority over the interests of thousands of neighbors? I hope you ponder and join us.

But here is a very likely scenario of why this situation came to be and who made what mistakes. There was a big reveal in Travers Park of the redesign (not sure of year), held by Danny Dromm&#039;s office and Parks. Very hard to hear as it was a day of loud planes flying overhead. Private conversations became the norm. During one of these, a few people said why doesn&#039;t the plan here show the inset that was agreed upon for the universal pre-K public kindergarden and the Garden School to access its garages and for the Toyota dealership to keep its repair business? <strong>The NYC Parks designer&nbsp; (don&#039;t have name here) said this is only a preliminary drawing. We haven&#039;t gone to specifics yet and these issues will be addressed as they were part of the negotiation. And MY STRONG SUSPICION is that these updated plans were never done - or were never released. A mistake! But if they exist and someone finds them, this whole effort instantly goes up in smoke.</strong><br /><br />&nbsp; And now people are saying &quot;Look, the drawing says the whole street is ours&quot; and other people who have been involved since the beginning are saying this was not the agreement. Let it go, as it is an undesirable space, not a significant hazard and in fact more of a benefit on balance regarding traffic on Northern Blvd than a liability. But a certain group is stuck here with only this issue and not the holistic goal of making the new Travers Park the best is can be for the whole community. Can anyone really justify for example that the heavily used basketball court has remained untouched through three! renovations in Travers in the past 12 years. Teens don&#039;t matter? That court is an embarrassment yet this group is obsessing some yards over on this street inset.<br /><br />&nbsp; So I strongly encourage people to move on and be mindful about making the whole park better for all and that square footage is not a priority in this case but a quality park for all is.
