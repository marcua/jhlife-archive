				Hi - <br /><br />I was recommended to this board by a friend and hoping someone on here could offer some help and direction. <br /><br />I&#039;m a native &quot;Jackson Heights-er&quot; - no matter how many times I move out, I always wind up back here. Anyway, I&#039;ve been living for the last 7 years in a great apt on 76th - however my landlord (it is a sublet) will be selling so I need to move. Why aren&#039;t I buying you may wonder? Honestly, I&#039;m still recovering from paying for the costs associated with two terminal cancer illnesses in my family. If I could, trust me I would. <br /><br />In any event, I want to stay in JH and am looking for a 1 (or 2) bedroom apt - preferably in the 70&#039;s and hopefully around the $14-1500 or so mark - and a real rental this time, not a sublet from a coop. As I&#039;ve begun looking, I&#039;m running into a lot of coop sublets (which are limited to 1 or 2 yrs max) but hardly anything on real rental units - and I know there are a ton in JH. Even the RE agents I&#039;ve contacted seem to deal pretty much in coop sublets. <br /><br />So anyone know of any or have a 1-2 bedroom rental available September at the $14-1500 mark - please get in touch!! <br /><br />Thanks very much for any and all help any of you may offer!! <br /><br />**If it helps - I&#039;m a 40 yr single white collar professional male with a solid work history; excellent references (professional and personal); references from current and previous landlord; good salary and &quot;OK&quot; credit (see above on paying for costs of two terminal cancer illnesses). Thanks Again!**

				I don&#039;t know first hand if this would work, but what about walking around the neighborhood and stopping into the rental buildings to see if there is a super around or a phone number for management posted? <br /><br />Walking around and stopping into the foyers would at least give you a sense of whether the buildings are well cared for. &nbsp;I can understand not wanting to rent a coop because of the restrictions and the threat of not having your lease renewed, however, I would imagine that a big benefit of renting in a coop is that the building upkeep is going to be generally better than in an average rental building. &nbsp;So it&#039;s just something to watch out for. <br /><br />There have been posts in the past on this board about Washington Plaza, which is supposed to be a good rental complex. &nbsp;Maybe you could stop by there too.

				Hello, Shelby is right on. We&#039;ve lived in several buildings over the years and have saved RE fees by going to the management companies directly. Also there are alot of private two/three family homes north of northern blvd. Perhaps you can find something with a yard as well. Try craigslist and if you walk around you will see signs (I do all the time) for rent by owner. Good Luck!

				I just wanted to thank everyone who commented on this post and sent messages with suggestions, names, numbers - everything. All of you were truly helpful!!<br /><br />I am happy to report that after a very stressful couple of weeks of calling the numbers you sent, walking around talking with supers on the weekends and looking at a number of apartments, I was able to secure a really nice apartment in Washington Plaza. If anyone is looking I would *highly* recommend Eileen - she made the entire process so easy - rentthrueileen@gmail.com<br /><br />Now to find a mover for the big move - all of 2 blocks - ha!&nbsp;
