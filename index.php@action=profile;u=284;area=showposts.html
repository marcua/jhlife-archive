					Did anyone notice at version 2.0 of the map has been created and released (there&#039;s a stack at Espresso 77)?&nbsp; Also, did anyone notice that the Residences at Jackson Heights (<a href="http://www.jacksonheightsliving.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.jacksonheightsliving.com/</a>) bought a lot of advertising space on the maps?&nbsp; While &quot;selling out&quot; seems to harsh, the advertising was a bit of a disappointment to see.&nbsp; I don&#039;t blame the artist though -- I&#039;m happy for his success as it&#039;s a great map.&nbsp; A guy&#039;s gotta do what a guy&#039;s gotta do.

					That Jack Heights logo is pretty bad.&nbsp; Considering that MPC is attempting to market to design-savvy 30-somethings in Williamsburg and Park Slope who are very conscious the importance of quality advertising and graphics, you&#039;d think they&#039;d create a more sophisticated logo.&nbsp; The current logo feels amateurish and, quite frankly, lame.&nbsp; I would have wanted them to create something that not only reflects the neighborhood but appropriately and successfully markets JH to their targeted demographic. As we&#039;ve seen, the current logo has become somewhat of a joke and opens up MPC&#039;s whole campaign and, thusly, the neighborhood, to scrutiny. <br /><br />Does anyone know if MPC created this campaign internally or if they worked with an agency?&nbsp; (I&#039;m assuming the latter, but who knows.)&nbsp; Surely they could have tapped into the talented pool of graphic designers and artists in JH to create a better logo.

					I was walking my dog on 35th Avenue the other night and was thinking about how it would be fun to show my Scrabble-obsessed sister the 35th Avenue street sign that&#039;s written out with Scrabble letters/points on the corner of 35th Avenue and 81st Street next to the Community Church -- an homage to the game that was invented in JH and was first played at the church.&nbsp; I looked up as I crossed 81st Street and to my surprise, the sign was missing!&nbsp; I did a double take, made sure I was in the right spot, and, in fact, the street has been removed.&nbsp; The normal 35th Avenue street sign is there but the Scrabble version, normally above it, is not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Does anyone know what happened to the 35th Avenue Scrabble street sign???

					If it&#039;s helpful, I know that Fillmore Hall and Griswold Hall both have private dog runs. I&#039;ve heard that the boards of both buildings have considered (and/or are considering) doing away with them but that there is opposition from residents (at least at Fillmore) because the dog runs are used fairly frequently. Perhaps others can chime in if their buildings have dog runs.

					True, broad, but I guess I was thinking more in terms of types of establishments on Roosevelt that are open late at night and the types of clientele said establishments attract as reasons I wouldn&#039;t want to hang out there at 2am for a longer period of time than just walking through.&nbsp; But you&#039;re right, there are lots of people there all the time and I would definitely head in that direction if I felt threatened or unsafe on 37th.

					I too am a woman in my twenties. I have never felt unsafe but take the same precautions I do in any other neighborhood that empties out late at night -- I stay aware of my surroundings, always know where my cell phone is, etc. I also notice cops walking around the neighborhood at all hours, which is very reassuring.&nbsp; I agree, though, that Roosevelt Avenue is not somewhere I&#039;d want to hang out at night.<br /><br />The one time I had to call the cops (some drunk teenagers outside of my window who were being noisey at 3am), they were there within a few minutes. Good to know.

					guvner, unfortunately I haven&#039;t been able to track down any (reliable) doggy day care facilities here in JH. I have to take my dog into Manhattan for doggy day care and boarding. I don&#039;t know what I would do if he was too big to get on the subway.<br /><br />Re: dog runs... Luckily, my building has a dog run out back which is great for ball playing and off-leash milling around (and is one of the reasons why I moved in). However, it still doesn&#039;t offer the socialization factor of the public dog runs available in other neighborhoods -- ever since I moved in, I&#039;ve never been in the dog run with anyone other than my dog. Again, I schlep my dog into Manhattan so that he can socialize at public dog runs. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also found that many people for whatever reason (unsocialized dogs, no time, etc.) don&#039;t like to stop and let their dogs &quot;say hello&quot; to each other. Many people that I&#039;ve encountered with big dogs say that their dogs are &quot;unfriendly&quot; and have actually crossed the street to avoid letting their dog(s) near my dog. If I do say so myself, my dog is very well-behaved on walks and approaches other dogs with tentative caution (then warms up if the other dog is friendly), so it&#039;s not like they&#039;re trying to avoid a small, yappy, jumping dog. Point is, while you should always be cautious about approaching unknown dogs, it seems that you should take extra caution in JH if the other owners haven&#039;t been proactive about it already. Perhaps if there was a place for dogs to socialize (a dog run!),&nbsp; there wouldn&#039;t be so many dogs in the neighborhood that haven&#039;t been properly socialized and this wouldn&#039;t be an issue. Don&#039;t mean to generalize here but it&#039;s just my experience walking my dog around the neighborhood anytime between 7pm and 10pm. There are plenty of wonderful friendly dogs and owners in JH too!
