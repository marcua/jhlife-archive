			I have a friend who has lived in Brooklyn for years who now says she is looking for something either here or in Sunnyside.&nbsp; I would dearly love to have her closer to JH!&nbsp; She is looking for a rental for around $1000.&nbsp; If you live in a rental building and can recommend it (within reason - it doesn&#039;t have to be perfect), please let me know the location.&nbsp; If she is walking around the neighborhood maybe she can check it out and see if she can locate the super to find out about vacancies.<br /><br />

			I used to live in the Washington Plaza - 73-12 35th Avenue.&nbsp; It is a well-managed rental building with a nice community feel to it.&nbsp; I think I paid more than $1000 for a 1BR five years ago when I lived there.&nbsp; Still, it may be worth checking out.&nbsp;

			$1000 a month in New York City is going to be almost impossible to find unless you have lived in the same rent stabilized apartment since 1920.

			I know it&#039;s on the low side, but she&#039;s willing to live in a studio.&nbsp; And especially in this neighborhood where many residents tend to be older and have probably lived in their units for lots of years. . . when they vacate the rent will only be raised 18% plus any additional for renovations or new appliances.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s entirely possible to find a $1000 studio and maybe even one bedroom here if you are willing to spend some time looking, pounding the pavement and asking friends.<br /><br />Plus, I have not raised this possbility with her, but there are lots of coop rentals as well and from what I have heard, $1000 is the going rate for a studio in a coop.&nbsp; I personally would not want to do a coop rental from an owner because of the hassles with boards etc. and why deal with that if you aren&#039;t even getting the benefits of home ownership? But other people don&#039;t seem to have a problem with it, and maybe they enjoy living in a building where more people are owners than renters as the property probably tends to be better-kept.<br /><br />

That&#039;s a whole other set of parameters.
