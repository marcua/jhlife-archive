				I noticed a legal notice on the door of the restaurant that never opened called Swim Two Birds located at<br />7605 37th Ave.&nbsp; It was scheduled to open in 2016.&nbsp; The legal notice is from the landlord seeking $269,000 in back rent.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a camera so I could not post the notice.&nbsp; Its a combination of a legal notice demanding payment and eviction.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain when it was posted but I noticed it yesterday afternoon. <br /><br />I remember the owner Stuart was very sincere about opening and he did spend a significant sum of money renovating but was faced with many issues from NYC, the landlord and possibly the Liquor Authority.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember all the details.&nbsp; There was a lot of excitement about this restaurant opening.&nbsp; Sadly, it never happened.&nbsp;

				it would have been nice to see the place open since it sounded like a very interesting concept, but Stew didn&#039;t do himself any favors by attacking pretty much everyone -- from the operators of longstanding restaurants to the community board members who had to approve his permits.

				I was going to say that with the demise of this site we will lose the fascinating Swim Two Birds saga--which I thought would make a great mystery-type podcast. So only now after 6 years is an eviction notice being served? The whole thing was so very strange. I wonder what Stew is up to nowadays. It was a sad tale, really.

				I recall seeing the interior of that space being amazingly renovated.<br /><br />Incredibly fancy. <br /><br />The next person who leases the space will have a maybe $250K (or more?) head start re:renovations.

Restaurants are opening every single day in this city, and this forum jerked itself off for years fantasizing about Stew&#039;s &quot;fine dining&quot; raw oyster no ambient music closet of an eatery? Best part of the old threads was the poster &quot;Stevn&quot; who turned out to be absolutely right from the beginning. Nexxxxt!!!

				This saga was all part of the learning curve of being on this forum.<br /><br />Kinda an insider glimpse on &quot;how not to open a restaurant&quot;.<br /><br />Stew wanted to document &quot;starting a restaurant&quot; for the public. In order to promote the restaurant. And it was interesting.<br /><br />But ironically, it became even more fascinating when the situation flipped into &quot;lessons on how not to open a restaurant&quot;. <br /><br />Fantastic points... like &quot;DON&#039;T GET FIXATED ON DECOR AND BLOW ALL YOUR BUDGET&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;and then have nothing left to go through the process of city requirements for a restaurant.<br /><br />Also, maybe &quot;DON&#039;T ALIENATE POSSIBLE FUTURE CUSTOMERS DUE TO YOUR THIN SKIN .&quot; <br /><br />Thank you Stew for the many teaching experiences via this forum.<br /><br />It reminds me... I will miss this forum.&nbsp; Where I have been called male by some and female by others.<br /><br />Good thing it&#039;s a gender fluid era we live in.<br /><br /><br />

				not in your lifetime or mine. i just watched 30 minutes of politicians saying Jesus would advocate for sharing images advocating murder and laughing off violence against women because we really need to concentrate on keeping vaccines away from children. i had to stop when the congress&#039;s chief proponent of sexual abuse in youth sports started talking<br /><br />both sides. lol.

				The real problem is that side looks at the extreme leftist views with its anarchic agenda...with the same contempt.<br /><br />All extremists are exactly equal in their folly. With both sides playing the &quot;virtue&quot; card. <br /><br />Thankfully most folks aren&#039;t extremists. <br /><br />And that&#039;s why there is hope for the future!<br /><br />If a person concentrates on extremists and forgets that most people aren&#039;t...it probably leads to a lopsided view of the world. And an entrenched rigidity.

				there&#039;s nothing leftist about anarchism. nor is there anything right wing about it.<br /><br />anarchy is about the absence of rule. <br /><br />i recommend you actually pay attention to our current real-world politics and not spout the same tired &quot;hopey futurey&quot; stuff that suggests both sides really were doing good in Charlottesville.<br /><br />Remember which side wants to remind you that one religious/ethnic group in particular wants to replace &quot;real Americans.&quot;<br /><br />and embrace the tiki torchers as warmly as you wish.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I was thinking more about this. Because it&#039;s important.<br /><br />By dehumanizing either side...it is easy to not see them as people exactly like we are.<br /><br />Education is the answer. <br /><br />By learning who the &quot;other&quot; is...the &quot;other&quot; becomes just like you.<br /><br />That&#039;s the beauty of being human. We learn and progress...slowly.<br /><br />If Ben Ferencz, the 101 year old prosecutor at the Nuremburg Trials can be optimistic about the progress of humankind...(and he is)...then I am inspired to follow him as an example.<br /><br />And not be led down the path of others who dwell in bitterness.<br /><br />
