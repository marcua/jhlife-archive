I guarantee all of those restaurants are happy to have the business of people from outside the neighborhood.<br /><br />And what are you proposing? That everyone gets assigned an official ethnicity at birth, and then are only allowed to eat at restaurants corresponding to that race and ethnicity?

				Thanks for your contrastingly learned response, NYCPeromyscus! Even so, may I ask you to (re)read the DNA posting, please, and then consider the wider-reaching implications of this doctoral study? Without question, there is the obvious boost to select restaurateurs (though likely not the other, less savoury entrepreneurs along Roozie). What additional effects might result, however, from hypotheses about the &quot;super-diversity&quot; up and down the Avenue, when those assertions are based solely in limited investigations of the wide variety of &quot;ethnic&quot; cuisines present? <br /><br />For my (clearly uninformed) part, I&#039;m skeptical about &quot;ethnicities&quot;--much less, &quot;race&quot;--being the only way &quot;diversity&quot; works. Historically, that is, such explorations invite the kind of class and cultural interactions that have led at best to gentrification and at worst to genocide. Sure, Marco Polo&#039;s account of the riches of Cathay inspired Christopher Columbus, but did the locals in the &quot;New World&quot; really need his &quot;discovery&quot;?&nbsp; Or are we to concern ourselves simply with consumption?

				I&#039;m sorry voelteer, but simply not interested in discussing how white people eating at restaurants in Queens will lead to genocide.&nbsp; And your use of a few big scare words (Orientalism) and scare quotes makes me even less interested.

				It could only be taken as offensive, if you are unaware of the origins of the term. Unfortunately, it does appear to be a big scary word on this thread. For the sake of preventing further confusion about what is meant by Orient/Oriental/Orientalist/Orientalism in this context, please see <em>Orientalism</em> by Edward Said (New York: Pantheon, 1978). Or, if you prefer the CliffNotes/Wikipedia version, see: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)&gt;. <br />Thanks again!&nbsp; :)

				Voelteer, <br /><br />The article was by someone who loves food. It is about eating.&nbsp; What am I missing? I don&#039;t see any trace of an attitude towards South Asian cultures that could be characterized as &quot;Orientalist &quot; i.e., essentialized as exotic, underdeveloped, irrational, etc. etc. Here is an excerpt from the &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; you recommended:<br /><br />Since the publication of Orientalism (1978), by Edward Said, the academic discourse of critical theorists featured the term Orientalism in applications particular to the variety of cultural imperialism imposed upon the societies of the Near East, which is the cultural hegemony that politically justifies Western imperialism. The praxis of cultural imperialism reduces (essentializes) those societies as culturally static and intellectually undeveloped; the fabrication of cultural superiority is that Oriental culture is a thing (an Other) that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit to the orientalist fabrication is the culturally opposite idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and thereby superior, whilst Oriental societies are inferior for being undeveloped, irrational, and inflexible.[3]
