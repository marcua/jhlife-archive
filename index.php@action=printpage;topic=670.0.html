				One that tapes &quot;everything&quot; and cleans up if they spill and doesn&#039;t leave cloggy rolls in your sink or tub.<br />One that doesn&#039;t make you think you could have done a better job yourself if you had time.<br /><br />We have a small apartment, but I do want to make sure we don&#039;t need to have it redone anytime soon. We did all the priming ourselves and my neck is killing me, so I want to hire someone to do the finish coat(s).

				I used this guy--Robert Osorio--and his crew to paint my apartment when I moved to JH a couple of years ago. I heard about them from&nbsp; someone I work with. They did a really fine job, which included plaster skim coats on the walls before painting. They&#039;re especially detail oriented and careful--contrasting wood trim was perfect. The building I live in is from the 1930s, but the walls looked like new afterwards. A year or so later a friend of mine moved into Dunnolly Gardens and used them. She was also very happy with their work. Now a third acquaintance of mine is using them for a total redo of her apartment in the Andrew Jackson. In this case we discovered that Robert has a lot of skill in helping choose color schemes. He&#039;s got guys who can do just about anything. In this Andrew Jackson job he realigned (squared) existing kitchen cabinets, replaced the doors, repainted the frames, made alterations to closet walls, created an opening between kitchen and living room, is putting in new tile in the kitchen, etc. A sub-crew of his refinished my floors and is doing the floors here as well. He&#039;s just very good and very responsible. His prices are reasonable. I&#039;m including some pics of my finished apartment as well as the job he&#039;s currently doing.
