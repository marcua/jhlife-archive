				https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/meet-catalina-cruz-queens-dreamer-running-for-office.html<br /><br />Excerpt:<br /><br />“I’m a punk when it comes to pain,” admits Catalina Cruz. “I’ll cry from a paper cut.” These are not sentiments one would expect from someone entering the pummeling world of American politics, but Cruz is currently standing in front of the Queens establishment where she got her ears pierced 24 years ago. She peers through the window at the baubles on display before continuing on, her rain boots making a muffled clomp on the sidewalks of Jackson Heights — one of several neighborhoods that comprise District 39, the vacant Assembly seat of which Cruz hopes to fill after the primary election this September.<br /><br />Cruz, who became a U.S. citizen in 2009, is currently the first Dreamer to run for office in New York state; if she wins, she will be the third Dreamer to ever take office in this country (after Wendy Carrillo of California and Ruben Kihuen of Nevada). In 1992, at the age of 9, she boarded a plane in Medellin, where she could see Pablo Escobar’s jail from the sidewalk of her childhood home. She arrived at JFK accompanied by her single mother, wearing her favorite outfit — a “pant situation with a shirt that had too many ruffles; it was not cute” — and carrying a tourist visa set to expire in six months. Growing up, this stretch of 82nd Street is where she came to tap into the Colombian community vibe. First stop: Las Americas Bakery, established in 1976 but since closed, never again to grace the world with their buñuelos.<br /><br />(https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/03/15/magazine/16-catalina.w512.h600.2x.jpg)

				Good article.&nbsp; I did some more research on the special election coming up and if I&#039;m correct in reading this, looks like we don&#039;t get to vote in it. Ari Espinal has already been appointed by the parties, and we can only vote come the September primaries, which is when Catalina Cruz will run against Ari. https://citylimits.org/2018/02/27/voters-in-queens-assembly-district-could-see-a-rarity-in-april-a-contested-race/<br /><br />Either way, I hope we get better turnouts. For a district with no representation at the moment (Peralta as IDC doesn&#039;t count) and which is heavily affected by current issues, we really need to have more people voting. I do look forward to the NY Senate Primary challenges, and am very impressed with Jessica Ramos.

				This is very important to understand- <br />There will be an election in September, and that is what Catalina is gearing up for. <br />That Ari got the seat handed to her is unfortunate, and would have cost a lot for Catalina to fight. <br />But in September, hopefully a bit miffed by this and the lack of any representation for so long...(assembly on break in June, yet Ari collects checks...) we can vote in a very worthwhile election for our district. Very important to have a fighter in the seat. Development on Broadway and to Queens Boulevard are in this Assembly district. <br />September, September, September, September!!!!! Which is also hard for candidates as it comes so quickly after a summer where many constituents are also on vacation. <br />Look for debates hosted by both JHBG and New Visions Democrats.

				Reps for Ari Espinal are going door-to-door to drum up support for her before the primary.<br /><br />An Espinal rep rang my bell last evening and offered some literature on her. I also got the sense they&#039;re a bit nervous about her primary chances (even though she&#039;s an incumbent). The guy had a bunch of questions and asked me whether I was leaning toward voting for her and whether I knew much about her.<br /><br />Any reason they&#039;d be nervous? Any views on her pro/con? Her record?<br /><br />I&#039;m a relative newbie to the nabe so any insight would be helpful.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />

She was appointed by district leaders after Moya vacated the seat to move to City Council. I would imagine campaign volunteers are trying to get a sense of how much support she has to gauge how close the election will be in the absence of polls. I&#039;ve gotten the same sense of insecurity from Peralta&#039;s campaign workers (which left me wondering if I should have just lied to them and said he&#039;d have my vote in the primary).

				Thanks Captain.<br /><br />Btw, just did a little research and found this article<br /><br />https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/09/05/assembly-district-39-questionnaires-catalina-cruz-vs-ari-espinal/ (https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/09/05/assembly-district-39-questionnaires-catalina-cruz-vs-ari-espinal/)<br /><br />It&#039;s a good one in that it quizzes each candidate on public transit issues.

				Just a point of information. Espinal was NOT appointed by the District Leaders. They do not have that power.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Governor Andrew Cuomo called for special election to take place April 24 to fill the seat that was vacated when Moya won the City Counsel seat, and Espinal already nabbed the Democratic Party, Working Families Party, and Women’s Equality Party endorsements. This all but guarantees a victory for her in April&quot; <br />(https://queenscountypolitics.com/2018/02/26/ari-espinal-intends-loud-voice-community-albany/)<br /><br />Now is the primary for the regular term for the Assembly<br />

				Last night I got my <em>second</em>visit from Espinal rep.<br /><br />Now I can definitely say that they are indeed nervous.<br /><br />While it&#039;s true Espinal wasn&#039;t actually appointed by the Queens machine, she might as well have been. She ran unopposed during a low-turnout special election in April. For a special election to the state Legislature, there are no party primaries, instead the party county committee <em>selects its candidate f</em>or what is a singular public vote. In a heavily Democratic district like most in New York City, the party’s nominee is virtually assured victory in a special election, and therefore gains at least some of the benefits of incumbency ahead of any subsequent intra-party challenges.<br /><br />But the reality is...she was ``elected&#039;&#039; in April and now has a real challenger, something she didn&#039;t have before.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;I can give a little bit here as I wasn&#039;t able to concentrate on the whole thing for other reasons. But Ari Espinal<br />did not show and there wasn&#039;t a reason specified and it seemed to have been canceled on her part that day.<br />So Catalina Cruz and Yonel Lettelier Sosa answered questions from the moderator, Katie Honan, who was <br />terrific. They were polite to one another which was appreciated by the audience and the CHHAYA staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;The two primary sponsors along with a number of other local community organizations are all non profits who<br />have concerns that they wanted to hear answers on and it was a disappointment not to hear Espinal have a <br />voice here- but it was her choice. That said, Catalina, was electric and seemed passionate, informed and<br />ready to take on this job. She had a number of concerns with immigrant issues like rent controls, recognizing<br />basements apts, school issues all the way through college affordability and housing for new grads who stay<br />and work here. Also allowing drivers licenses to be issued without a ss#. And concerns with health care and<br />seniors who use the ER for their doctors visits. She supports the bike lanes and wants transit reform with<br />some refinancing and stopping the use of transit funds for other projects. I am sure she said much more <br />but this is what I remember. She seemed very interested in listening to the constituents and the nail salon<br />workers who she had helped before were there and showed support. She&#039;s an attorney. Also the audience<br />seemed to respond well to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;Yonel was more laid back and repeatedly said that the problem with Catalina was her lack of long term residency<br />here in Jackson Heights, not Queens, but specifically in this area she would represent. She did not dispute this <br />so I guess it is true. He had some good points to make but on others he wanted to defer to have more time <br />to analyze issues like commercial rent control and the one test specialized HS exam. It sounds like he has had <br />experience representing this area over a number of years with police issues and labor disputes. But I sense he <br />is not thinking of changing the system but working with it as is. This may not be a bad approach but Cruz wanted <br />to course correct on a number of issues. Yonel&#039;s work experience definitely qualified him and I especially liked <br />the work he said he does with his wife with victims of domestic violence. <br /><br />&nbsp;Both of these candidates were credible and the event was well run by CHHAYA and JHBG and the other<br />community groups. It was well attended even though the auditorium was hot. Great to have this forum to see <br />what&#039;s out there. Feel much more informed as a result.

				I’ve been a supporter of Catalina for a while now but I’ve been open to hearing what Ari has to say. Ari’s people really seem to be stepping it up. I got a really, really nasty attack ad in the mail today (accusing Catalina of using this election as a stepping stone in her political career, helping to gentrify 82nd St, calling her a liar about political donations, and saying she just moved to the district for this political run). Don’t send me an ad that makes personal attacks about another candidate. Tell me why I should vote for you. That ad sealed the deal - I’m voting for Catalina.

				in what i hope will be the final assault of the season, i got a robocall from Peralta&#039;s campaign this morning -- at one minute after eight.<br /><br />Ari Espinal has actually called my cell phone personally twice in the past two weeks, while the Cruz campaign has relied on texts -- about one per day in September.<br /><br />i was away for a few days on family issues, and my partner saved our mailings -- literally a dozen or so from Espinal and Peralta, about four or five each from their opponents (both of whom i support). the worst of the bunch was an Espinal foldout that uses a photo seemingly designed to make Catalina Cruz look like she&#039;s in a police lineup.<br /><br />voting after work today, and hope it&#039;s a good turnout!
