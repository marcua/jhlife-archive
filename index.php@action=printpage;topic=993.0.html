				Living in New York City gives us an amazing array of dining and snacking choices and there is always a hidden gem somewhere.<br />Put down your favorites ........... :smitten:<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Forty Carrots </span><br />Bloomingdale&#039;s<br />1000 3rd Ave, 7th Fl<br />New York, NY 10022<br /><br />Located on the 7th Floor of Bloomingdaleâ€™s, Forty Carrots is known for there Frozen Yogurt which is amazing&nbsp; 8). They have two separate parts a dine- in section and a take- out section. I strongly recommend to dine in , they have an amazing brunch and lunch . It is also very inexpensive and has a vast amount of healthy choices, even the frozen yogurt is low fat. But, beware the large frozen yogurt is enough to feed 3&nbsp; :D Flavors are Red Raspberry, Original, Mango, and Chocolate, they are known to switch around flavors, and therefore it&#039;s always a surprise what the selection is. Amazing place, salads, sandwiches, and frozen yogurt.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Grand Lux Cafe </span><br />Roosevelt Field<br />Garden City, NY 11530<br />516-741-0096<br /><br />Located next to the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, Long Island&nbsp; (Only 20 - 25 minutes away by car). Grand Lux Cafe is a venture between the owners of The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and The Cheesecake Factory and has around 11 locations nationwide. The place is amazing over 20 foot ceilings and very upscale in decor. The menu ranges from all American, to Asian and European favorites with reasonable pricing and top notch quality and amazing serving sizes. Personal favorites are the Max Burger, Salmon Three Ways, and Sheilaâ€™s Dream Salad. They also have a very good kids menu. Prices range from $14 - $32&nbsp; &nbsp;, the kids menu is $5.50 - $7.00. They have outdoor seating!!!! :rockon: and avoid it during dinner time on the weekends it is packed&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u">Cafe Riviera</span><br />830 Manhattan Avenue<br />Brooklyn, NY 11222<br />(718) 383-8450<br /><br />Located in the heart of Greenpoint , this bakery is my favorite , sorry Lety&#039;s and Canelle&nbsp; :embarassed:. It is a mostly Polish speaking bakery but they are very friendly and helpful . There quality is heavenly, best croissants I&#039;ve had, they have raspberry, chocolate, ham and cheese and turkey and cream cheese filled croissants. My favorites are the large cheesecake slices with strawberry&#039;s and almonds on top, the amazing Tiramisu like no other filled with Gran Marnier, and Passion Fruit and Mango Mousse. This is only part of there selection, they have $1 espressos, windowed doors that open to the street, the prices are great, and there quality is top notch :smitten: . The space is small and only has 5 tables, which means it gets crowded often. I love this place, only 15 minutes away by car. The croissants range from $2.00 - $2.50 and the pastries are all $3.00.&nbsp; :rockon:<br />

				UVA - Italian wine bar on 2nd Avenue bet. 78th/77th.&nbsp; One of my favorite places to take someone in the mood for Italian.&nbsp; Good menu: appetizers, entrees, desserts... all good.&nbsp; Nice atmosphere.&nbsp; Tables on the sidewalk (hate eating with cars flying by) but inside it&#039;s very pretty and it has a backyard eating area that&#039;s also really nice. <br /><br />BOND STREET - nouveau Japanese on Bond Street bet. Lafayette and Broadway.&nbsp; Downstairs bar has lounge seating and finger foods.&nbsp; Love their rolls and dipping sauces: everything from curries to carrot/ginger.&nbsp; Upstairs restaurant has two floors.&nbsp; The middle one has a sushi bar and leather booth/banquet seating.&nbsp; Still love this place no matter how many new places open up.<br /><br /><br />

The twin African Tails are nice but a bit small (that&#039;s why I haven&#039;t ordered it in years...lol)&nbsp; I DON&#039;T DO CHICKEN IN TOLEDO (nothing wrong with it I just eat chicken too often so I have never ate it in Toledo).&nbsp; Any fish dish will do just fine for me and <br />I could go on and on.&nbsp; If you want you could just slip into the fancy bar at the entrance and just do some tapas, sangria and JW Gold.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth every penny and you will not forget this place.Sorry, No Sundays unless it&#039;s a special event!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />(http://aolsearch.aol.com/aol/redir?src=image&amp;requestId=ea9a22077189a674&amp;userQuery=funny+italoian+chef+gif&amp;clickedItemURN=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mooneyland.com%2FChef.gif&amp;moduleId=image_details.jsp.M&amp;clickedItemDescription=Image Details)<br /><div align="center"><strong>Joe Abbracciamento&#039;s<br />Italian&nbsp; <br />62-96 Woodhaven Boulevard, Rego Park, NY<br />718-478-6463</strong></div><br />This place was recommended to me 16 years ago.&nbsp; I used to go a couple of times monthly for years when I used to live in Howard Beach many moons ago.&nbsp; It&#039;s been there since the 50&quot;s and while they removed the medieval ugly <br />chandelier 10 years or so ago they did not remove the classic great Italian taste.&nbsp; Some people complain that it&#039;s gotten expensive for the area but if you are smart you can&nbsp; order the prefixed menu that has fettuccine Alfredo, Veal and chicken (one of them is a rollatini)&nbsp; plus coffee and dessert for $60 for a couple.&nbsp; You&#039;ll leave satisfied and will probably recommend it to other.&nbsp; I have to admit I don&#039;t usually order dishes with the heavy red tomato sauces so I wouldn&#039;t know what to tell you.&nbsp; They have a popular Frito or broiled seafood dish as well (not my favorite but pretty good) and the stuffed Veal chop changed from the one I loved many years ago. Good wine but the service can be dicey during very busy hours.&nbsp; The place is ran by family and whenever I have been there the daughter in law has always been sweet and efficient.&nbsp; If you go on the evening (specially weekends) please make reservations since many a times we couldn&#039;t get in.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">(http://picasion.com/pic2/3fb2bc94069b38fdefdcad68cd493bf4.gif)<strong><br />Keens Chophouse (Steakhouse)<br />72 west 36th street<br />NY NY 10018</strong></div><br /><strong>Most fun steak spot for me and 100+ years old in Murray Hill.&nbsp; They are known for their huge Mutton and rightfully so.&nbsp; Only a couple of blcoks from my favorite Spaniard spot.&nbsp; These people have a gigantic wine list so you better know your wines because these waiters don&#039;t know but Opus One...OY VEY!!!&nbsp; They have a full bar and the place is so cool.&nbsp; Thousands of pipes hanging from the ceiling and even General MacArthur&#039;s is proudly displayed at the entrance.&nbsp; The bar is old world and robust, very macho but super cool. They have a second floor for those busy days and they have a healthy lunch crowd as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go as often as I did many years ago but I will squeeze it in a few times yearly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t explore the menu too much and I stick to my favorite appetizers, Oyster Rockefeller,&nbsp; avocado with the crab and nuts and of course the Sliced Tomatoes and Onions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Try the Mutton Chop, Chateaubriand steak, short ribs and of course the porterhouse ;D.&nbsp; If you like fish they have 3 or 4 items but don&#039;t ask me about that because I never ate fish there and if you want fish what are you doing in Keens &gt;:(?&nbsp; Everything is a la carte (most better steak houses in the city are anyway) and you will pay between 40 and 50 per person for the entree with out sides.&nbsp; Folks, this is a fantastic example of old world American style steakhouse.&nbsp; It is a fun place to eat and people watch.&nbsp; On a couple of occasions they seem to have forgotten the seasoning but nothing a little salt couldn&#039;t fix (for me that&#039;s it).&nbsp; Keens can get expensive if you go for the seafood tray and Lincoln Oysters ($100) but if you order sensibly there is no need to be worry. On a last note, if your waiter tends to leave for a long time please let him know that you are on call or something because sometimes this guys leave for long time with no apparent reason.&nbsp; Peter Luger still has the fame of the best steaks but I always have more fun at Keens.</strong><br /><br /><div><span style="font-size: 20pt;" class="bbc_size">OMG I&#039;m Hungry</span></div>
