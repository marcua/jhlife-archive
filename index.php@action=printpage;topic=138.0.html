				O.K.&nbsp; Although I love living in Jackson Heights, there are a few additions I&#039;d like to see in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I thought I&#039;d post them here....maybe, just maybe, some entrepreneur might take note and make Jackson Heights even more interesting.&nbsp; Here are a few items from my wish list:<br /><br />A good clean fish market somewhere in the vicinity of 37th Avenue<br />A bagel place with on-site bagel making facilities<br />A great pizza shop that offers variety by the slice<br />A place dedicated to domestic and international cheeses<br />A bakery that bakes a good variety of loaves (Carollo doesn&#039;t cut it for me)<br /><br />Wow!&nbsp; All my items are food related.&nbsp; Looking forward to reading what everyone else wants to see in the nabe. <br /><br />

				Doesn&#039;t M and V bagels on 37th make their own? <br /><br />My additions, though all the previous wishes are seconded:<br /><br />*Another coffee shop (I know, Espresso 77 just opened today, but a larger one would be great, and I&#039;m hoping this neighborhood could support a couple).<br />*A liquor store with better wine<br />*More french/american/bistro (admittedly bourgeoise) food options. <br /><br />I have to admit, though I could do with fewer 99 cent stores, JH actually has many good places, they are just a little spread around. Here is the wishlist for neighborhood amenities we made when looking at apartments, and how this one stacks up:<br /><br />*Park (Um, no, not really)<br />*Gym (Not amazing, but EFN does the job for me until something better comes along)<br />*Bagel Place (Check - M &amp; V. Not amazing, but decent, cheap and friendly)<br />*Coffee shop with wifi (One small one, now)<br />*Movie theater (Nope)<br />*Bookstore (Well, no)<br />*Good grocery options (Tons. None are perfect, but altogether not horrible. WAY better than many other neighborhoods, actually)<br />*Health/Organic options (Health Food store on 37th btwn 83-84 is pretty good, not amazing)<br />*Local casual bar (Terraza and Ready Penny are OK, not great)<br />*Hardware Store (Jackson Hardware on Roosevelt is great)<br />*Banking options (Plenty)<br />*A bike shop (The one on 37th in the low 90&#039;s)<br />*Sushi (Yup)<br />*A public library branch (Small, but it does the job)<br />*Video store (A couple, but increasingly less important with on-demand and PPV)<br />*Office supplies (The place on 37th btwn 82-83 -- I usually work from home, so this can be key)<br />*Decent newsstand (A few....note I said &quot;decent&quot; not amazing)<br />*Decent bakery (Not so much...)<br /><br />Having just moved back to NYC from a few years in a college town, I&#039;m actually OK with what JH offers at the moment, and I like the many other things it has to offer that weren&#039;t on our list. No place is perfect, and considering we would be living in a place 1/4 the size of our new apartment in any other decent neighborhood, I&#039;ll just hop on the amazingly good transit options and head to other parts of Queens, Manhattan and even Brooklyn when I need something I can&#039;t get here. Books, CDs, clothes, and &quot;fun&quot; shopping happen in Soho, Park Slope, etc, but I feel like the necessities are actually well covered here. I won&#039;t complain if it gets better, but it&#039;s not horrible by any stretch.

				For movie theaters, what about Jackson Triplex - has anyone been? They show really mainstream movies - now it&#039;s American Gangster, Enchanted, Fred Claus, and The Mist. <br /><br />Bakery - Lety&#039;s (Italian), La Nueva (Colombian), and the amazing Chinese bakery across from Pacific Market on 75th/Broadway<br /><br />

				As a longtime resident I have decided to invest in the neighborhood and have found a place to buy ( which is somewhat small&nbsp; 700sf ground level and 650sf basement level) on 37th ave in the district . What do you think I can do with this space or do you know anyone interested in leasing a space such as this to establish a place that is not a 99 cent store , beauty salon , or any of the things that plague the neighborhood ( A children&#039;s bookstore be a good idea) What else would be a good idea with this space, any input is greatly appreciated<br /><br />Thank You :)&nbsp;

				I&#039;m very excited by your post.&nbsp; It would be great to see more of our retail spaces owned by community residents.<br /><br />If and when you&#039;re ready to divulge this information, it would be helpful to know what target rent you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; That will help prospective business owners determine what types of businesses are feasible in the space.<br /><br />As far as your question goes, there is a neighborhood wish list thread (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=138.0), and a lot of discussion about a bookstore (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=62.0).&nbsp; <br />From what I&#039;ve heard, independent bookstores have an extremely difficult time economically.&nbsp; To survive they need to be big and centrally located... it would be tough in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />But I think you&#039;re on the right track in thinking about a children-oriented business.&nbsp; We have a growing population of families with young children, and the commercial businesses haven&#039;t quite caught up with their needs.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to see a play cafe (http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/media/Oakland-Magazine/March-2007/Java-and-Jungle-Gyms/), but I think this would require more space than you have.<br /><br />

				I would love a knitting/crafts store -- a place to take classes/buy supplies. I&#039;d also really love a great magazine store. <br /><br />By the way, congratulations on buying the place. It&#039;s great to see local people investing in the neighborhood.

				It&#039;s interesting to note that a lot of what is being asked for was actually here relatively recently but seems to have gone out of business either for lack of support or inflated rents. <br /><br />We used to have a JD Bakery on 74th St. <br /><br />At one time there were two Keyfoods, in addition to what is now TradeFair and Met on 37th ave. as well as a C-Town where CVS is now on Northern and 74th.<br /><br />Ferns was a fantastic stationery store on 74th St.&nbsp; We do have a Staples now on 103 and Roosevelt. There is Wise Stationery on 37th Ave. btwn. 81st and 82nd, which seems to be a good place for art supplies.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Abehill was useful for hardware, and Archer&#039;s on 74th and Roosevelt was a lot larger and staffed with friendly helpful people at one point in time. Then there was Long Island Janitor Supply on Roosevelt I think between 75th and 76th or 76th and 77th, that&#039;s where you went for some serious hardware when you needed it. <br /><br />Discount Books, though no B&amp;N, was a great place to actually buy a book and bring it home to read. <br /><br />There was a larger cafe on 37th ave between 78th and 79th, complete with live local musicians, etc.<br /><br />We had at least 2 fish markets on 37th ave. <br /><br />Oh, and a real butcher on 74th st. <br /><br />We were be speckled with Irish pubs for quite some time. <br /><br />And there were 2 movie theatres on 82nd St. <br /><br />Most of these stores disappeared within the last 10 to 12 years. Not terribly long in the life of a neighborhood.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to sound like a life long JHer (even though I am) bemoaning the loss of the better times in days gone by, but it&#039;s interesting to note that the very things this neighborhood couldn&#039;t support in the last 10 years are the things we&#039;d all like to have back now. <br /><br />So my question I suppose is; What&#039;s different now ? It doesn&#039;t seem like the population has grown or changed so drastically in the past 10 years that these failed businesses can rise form the ashes like a Phoenix to a new life of success and profitability, or can they ?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				700sf does not a theatre make.<br /><br />A bookstore would need to do a very large amount of volume in sales to afford such a small space. <br />A deli/salad bar place would be great. <br />A cheese place would also be nice.<br />There&#039;s a great salumi/cheese bar in Boerum Hill called &quot;Sample&quot; that would fit in nicely. They do not need a commercial kitchen because all the food is &quot;cured&quot; and they have a great wine selection and outdoor seating. That would be a perfect addition to this neighborhood.<br /><br />Actually, come to think of it, the entire Boerum Hill/Cobble Hill area has a similar scale of retail spaces to Jackson Heights. Any of those local shops could easily be transplanted here.<br /><br />How about a nice antique furniture store? There&#039;s a lovely one on Smith Street owned by a Korean designer.<br /><br /><br />A bike shop would be great, too. I have to go to Manhattan or to Sunnyside for parts.

				The way I see it:<br /><br />&nbsp;- A bike shop would encourage more cycling.<br />&nbsp;- The more cyclists on the road, the less traffic there&#039;d be, thus also abating an already serious problem.<br />&nbsp;- Need I mention the health benefits?<br /><br />And heck, the neighborhood is small enough that you can get everywhere on two wheels.<br /><br />There are also a lot of children in the neighborhood, and what kid doesn&#039;t like a bike?

				Please, please, please no more restaurants, coffee places, bristros, 99cents, etc.<br /><br />We need a book store for children and teens (adults too). There is an elementary school and 2 junior high schools in the vincinity and not one decent book store. Yet the kids are excepted to read 75+ books per year. The library doesn&#039;t offer much to the teens of Jackson Heights. Actually all those books the kids have already read. So, please, please, please, let there be a book store.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know what would be best in this space, but I&#039;d love a place to buy nice flowers (although I have to say that the guy in the subway station has okay stuff, but a bigger variety would be nice), good coffee by the pound, cheese, nice wine and most of all, salads of some kind. I&#039;d personally rather have prepared or a bar where you order, rather than a salad bar, but I&#039;ll take what I can get. (This may be the kind of thing Jay Dines is planning, though.) <br /><br />Something child-oriented would also be nice, and I think there are enough children (not to mention tons of pregnant women!) in the neighborhood to support something like that. I&#039;m not sure if that<br /><br />A bookstore would be nice, but, as someone else said, it is almost impossible to make a profit. Maybe the Jay Dines community space might be a good place for book vendors and/or mini-flea markets with vintage sellers, even if it&#039;s just on the weekends? Williamsburg has some set-ups like this.<br /><br />I&#039;d also love a decent gym with good classes, but obviously, this isn&#039;t the space for it!<br /><br />And I have to disagree with Lourdes. If there&#039;s a bistro in the neighborhood, I&#039;d love to know where it is. I&#039;d love to see one pop up, though I doubt this is the space for it.

				We really need a casual bar - good beer selection that invites a laid back but not old fogie crowd.

				I disagree that this neighborhood has too much food. Though it does have a lot of places, most fit a couple different categories of ethic groups. And though I have not interest in the neighborhood becoming Park Slope, it would be nice for one or two places that one can get a class of wine or steak frites.<br /><br />So , I think there is a big void for either a little bistro or a small Wine/beer/cheese bar. You can look into the spaces that the bar, the other room (http://www.theotheroom.com/room.html), in Manhattan for advise. The couple different locations they have a tiny and they still offer a full menu of beers and wines. Serving cheese would only take a small refrigerator or two. Especially with some beers on tap.<br /><br />Or a nice Wine/Cheese shop like Smith and Vine and Sticky Cheese in Cobble Hill which is own by the same couple. They have an incredible business built up, maybe they would like to expand to another neighborhood. <br /><br />I&#039;m not really interested in anything kid related since I don&#039;t have any and I&#039;m a Park Slope refugee. However if that is the real need, then can only help bring other businesses into the area because it will draw other people to move to JH.<br /><br />The book store idea is a terrible idea. I would love one in the neighborhood as much as anyone, but with the internet there is very little profit margin in the best of times for a book store. I just heard the other day that the 7th Avenue Book store in Park Slope is closing. That just make me cringe that who ever opens a bookstore will have a very hard time even with all of us supporting it.

				While they are certainly valid, most of the suggestions in this thread are for businesses I would not frequent. I donâ€™t cook under any circumstances, so I would not visit a cheese or fish store. I do not have (or even much care for) children, so I would avoid a childrenâ€™s store like the plague. (I didnâ€™t even know there was such a thing as a â€œbook store for children.â€) I do not ride a bicycle, I do not have nor want a pet, I do not do quilting etc. etc. I do not even drink alcohol, so I have no concern for a wine store, wine bar, beer restaurant or â€œIrish pub.â€ (Plus because Iâ€™m gay, I find there are actually plenty of places around to drink even though I would go primarily to socialize.) Most of the suggestions in this thread seem to be for better versions of businesses that already exist, e.g., a better pizzeria when we have plenty, a Manhattan-style salad bar when we have green grocers like that Fruital Farms and others, stores that sell specific foods (wine, cheese, fish) that can be obtained in our numerous supermarkets. (The exception is a type of store the member doesnâ€™t much use, so instead of suggesting another, but better, shop, the request is for â€œnot anotherâ€ discount store, <em>sari</em> shop etc.) While I do not doubt that we could use many of these businesses, we do not know if a new one would be any better than the existing ones. We could wind up with a store of a calibre not unlike what we already have.<br /><br />I decided I would try to determine what business I would like. Honestly, almost everything I could want is already here; thatâ€™s why I moved to Jackson Heights. A few things I would like do not match the ethnic groups prevalent here: I would love a place to buy Middle Eastern delicacies, desserts or music, but I donâ€™t think a business like that would thrive. Then I hit upon it. I would love a good independent thrift store. Instead of seeking what exists in the surrounding areas, I would love to buy second-hand music, books and clothing in Jackson Heights. (The local synagogue has a big sign saying something like â€œThrift shop is now open,â€ and then every time I approach the building, it is in fact closed.) Anyone else find this worthy?

(Toddler Happy Hour is now my FAVORITE weekly event in JH!!!)&nbsp; But on my first visit to the very well-attended event, I noticed that no one in the group was speaking in Spanish to anyone else in the group.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think if Cafe Greco (sp?) opened and ultimately closed&nbsp; a few years before its time.&nbsp; The comfy seating and overpriced coffee and excellent baked good and poetry and live chamber music during Sunday brunch were really great.&nbsp; I bet today, the place would thrive.&nbsp; When that wonderful bookstore on 37th closed, I felt like it was the end of an era for the neighborhood.&nbsp; Now, a bookstore is high on everyone&#039;s wishlist.<br /><br />Yeah, I think the population has really changed a lot.&nbsp; And the businesses in the neighborhood will have to evolve to meet the changing needs.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From what I understood Cafe Greco was fairly popular in the beginning and it fizzed out. I agree, though, it would survive more now. I loved the bookstore on 37th ave, great used books at wonderful prices. I don&#039;t agree that the internet displaces people reading books. I have a feeling it would be very welcome in this area. <br /><br />The population has changed, however, the non-native English speaking population, esp South Americans have really created some great hang-outs, especially along Northern Blvd. I can say the same thing for Indians/Bangladeshis/Pakistanis who have created quite a lively community for themselves. <br /><br />So, that said. It&#039;s too bad they&#039;re isn&#039;t more mixing. I do hear people go into La Nueva and some other places that are South American, however, seems few and far between. Also same said for some of the Indian restaurants. I think Jackson Diner (from the last time I went), is one where you see cross-cultural consumers. Lety&#039;s also seems to attract a variety of cultures (including the over 50 set). <br /><br />On the other hand, native english speakers might also want stores/hang-outs they see as more integral to their culture (perhaps)--that would be a Starbucks type places, high end delis/bagel shops,&nbsp; French bistros and bookstores where books are written in English. That said I wanted to that the&nbsp; Spanish bookstores from what i&#039;ve seen are gems, and children&#039;s one is just great. So, one could say that the businesses here are serving the needs of some of the population, just maybe not the entire population in the way they&#039;d like. However, perhaps more mixture will come in over time. <br />

				I second the idea of a performance space. I know it&#039;s not&nbsp; large but even expresso 77, which is tiny, has live music. In my fantasy this place would also serve wheatgrass juice and have shelves of free books for trading. I&#039;m not sure how the rent would work out but we could set it up as a cooperative and take turns staffing it. We had a space like this in college which sold health food and housed a zine library. <br /><br />ps. If anyone sets up a decent way to trade books in the neighborhood, I&#039;m in.

				A forum like this was once a long-held fantasy of mine... and I found it today, so that&#039;s one down, and dozens more to go.<br /><br />I would like to see all of the single-story commercial buildings on Roosevelt Avenue erect solar farms on their rooftops to help us raise our standard of living by lowering energy costs and consumer prices across the neighborhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can do without a Starbucks, as the area is already overrun with Dunkin Donuts and most of the bakeries provide great coffee with their delicious pastries and ethnic breads.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t think the homogenized ideal of Corporate Coffee Culture fits in with a neighborhood as diverse as ours.&nbsp; We have our own &quot;Pinkberry&quot; knock-off, for heaven&#039;s sake!&nbsp; This neighborhood is too clever for Starbucks.&nbsp; As far as my dream coffee shop goes, I would prefer one place where I could get a cup brewed in any of the national traditions available across the Heights.

				It seems that a decent pet shop is needed .I am still planning out what I&#039;m going to do (since the space is relatively small ) . I was thinking a pet hotel in the basement , with a very nice pet shop on the street level (in no way resembling an of the mediocre pet stores we have ) . Also, carrying holistic pet food and items of the nature (dog and cat accessories ) . Also, offering pet related services such as dog walking and maybe grooming in the future. Being a pet owner myself I am sick of going to Petco in Union Square or Long Island .<br />Once again thank you all for your insight and let&#039;s hope this may become a reality. :)

				APG, I love the idea of a quality pet supply shop in the neighborhood.&nbsp; It would be wonderful to have a shop that carries quality pet foods and products and to be able to purchase them right here in Jackson Heights!&nbsp; &nbsp;I think many people are more conscious these days about how they feed their pets, especially after that tainted pet food scare in 2007.&nbsp; Your idea of possibly offering grooming and pet walking services would be a definite plus for this type of business.&nbsp; If you do decide to go ahead with this plan, it would be great to see what products pet owners seek out the most.&nbsp; I know I&#039;ll have my list available!<br /><br />Best of luck! :rockon:

				I have to applaud this move as well. An upscale pet store is sorely needed in this neighborhood. Jackson Heights is very pet friendly and that was a big reason we moved here, but we have been disappointed with the pet stores in the area. I lug five pound bags of dog food home from work with me every few weeks because I can&#039;t find our brand in Jackson Heights. So if your taking suggestions let me know!

				Let me just say that not only is a great pet store needed, your idea for a pet hotel is MUCH needed as well! Since moving to Queens, we&#039;ve been searching for some one close by to board our cocker spaniel, and this would be an excellent resource. Also there was a fairly decent pet store in my old nab, park slope called NYC Pet. They carried some excellent brands of food, like wellness, science diet etc. You might want to check them out to get some ideas.<br /><br />

				Apparently, not everyone thinks JH is that great. That&#039;s very interesting. Perhaps we should start being more objective in our opinion of JH. And I think many have been as we listed our own &quot;worst of JH or what needs to be improved&quot;<br />Some may ask:&quot;Why is Bayside much better to live in? Why is Bell Blvd so much cooler than 37 Ave?&quot; What makes Metropolitan Ave in Middle Village so attractive? What makes Bay Terrace coops and condos and their shopping center so unique? Why is living in LeHarve coop in Beechurst so attractive? I know there are folks in Jackson Heights who are not familiar or who have never heard of these places? Additionally many folks like their neighborhoods not at the focus of attention since they don&#039;t want their neighborhood to change. Sometimes change is NOT good, as the McMansion trend in LittleNeck, Douglaston and Bayside has angered residents.<br />Cool bars, Starbucks and ethnic diversity may take a back seat to peace &amp; quiet suburban setting (but knowing you&#039;re in NYC and paying NYC R/E taxes!!), excellent school districts, <strong>not</strong> being near the city, and a place to park your car, namely your own driveway.<br /><br />I did not move to JH because of ethnic diversity, great restaurants or as some folks on the other link mentioned &quot;trannies&quot;. Nevertheless it is the best location for my wife and me and we have no immediate plans to move.<br />However I can&#039;t see myself retiring here, as I&#039;m some of us don&#039;t see as well.

				Hi Dawnie!<br /><br />Re: Cubano -- The closest 2 Cuban restaurants in the area are Rincon Criollo, right off Roosevelt Avenue on Junction Blvd. and El Sitio, on Roosevelt Avenue, near the corner of 69th Street.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard that El Sitio also has an Astoria location.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend either one of these places.&nbsp; They&#039;ve seen their best days come and go a long, long time ago.&nbsp; There&#039;s a sort of decent takeout place on Austin Street in Forest Hills called Latin Cabana.&nbsp; It&#039;s small with 3 or 4 stools by the window.&nbsp; Again, o.k., but not great.<br /><br />I would also love to have a great Cuban restaurant in the neighborhood, but truth be told, the best food we&#039;ve had has always been in Florida.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a huge fan of all the fusion preps that are commonly found in Manhattan...typical dishes plated up traditionally are best in my opinion.

				There is a 24-hr parking garage on 82nd Street at 37th Ave. Right across from the Vitamin Shoppe. That is where we tell our friends to go if they cannot find parking...though they always do. Does anyone know anything about that space? The exit I believe is on the 83rd street side, or maybe it&#039;s the otherway around. It looks like a 2 storey-structure.<br /><br />

				I think that a bar and a place ot have a decent burger, salad, wraps would be great.&nbsp; A nice place that people can meet for a drink and then people could play music and display their artwork there.

				We don&#039;t do burgers and we don&#039;t do beer and wine (yet), but you will find wraps, music and art by Jackson Heights folk and things to drink at Espresso 77...<br />And I think we are pretty nice too.<br />Cheers!<br />Julie

				I think a good health oriented type restaurant with wonderful salads and what not. I think a place that is delicious, good for the mind and body. Great places here, not exactly low-calorie or low cholesterol. Maybe throw in a few yoga classes, massage, etc, etc. Sell books and maybe craft items.

				This thread has been snoozing for a while.&nbsp; But now that we&#039;re seeing the re-emergence of some empty storefronts (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=867.0) in the neighborhood, there may be opportunities to bring in new types of businesses.&nbsp; Any updated thoughts on what we need?

				A tea house&nbsp; :angel:<br /><br />Also - a GYM! I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s been brought up before, but why don&#039;t we have a better one than EFN? Lack of space? It can&#039;t be lack of demand...I spoke to the manager at Evolution in Astoria and he said they&#039;re seriously looking into a space here.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be a very happy camper if all these things appear in JH!<br />

				--a bar that serves good beer<br /><br />--a trader joes<br /><br />--a place that serves coffee/tea and has a lot of seating and internet<br /><br />--a better pizza place<br /><br />--a good liquor and beer shop, staffed by people who actually drink (When I asked for Wild Turkey at the liquor shop nearest my house I was told it wasn&#039;t &quot;in season&quot;)<br /><br />--a sushi place (I know we have one but people seem to be fairly negative about it).<br /><br />--a more upscale mexican place (I love cart food, but it&#039;d be nice to sit down).<br /><br />--a bookstore

				I have always for years wanted a book store here ... though my son and I make a lot of use of the library.<br /><br />When we were younger, there was a used book store across fromcPS 69 that always sold comic books.&nbsp; Our generation in Jackson Heights thrived there.<br /><br />That all, said, my question is:&nbsp; anyone know what the old Baskin &amp; Robbins store will become?&nbsp; I really miss it (even though there are two Baskins at each of the bigger Dunkins).
