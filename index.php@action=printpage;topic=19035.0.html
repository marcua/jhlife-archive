				...a cell phone store! This is so depressing. And the former clothing store on that block is going to be some sort of medical office. Maybe another oddball weight loss clinic? I find those places so...dubious. Really???? Does anyone ever see any clients in those places? People go in and pay them enough money to fund a business rent for some sort of weight loss program? I have a lot of trouble believing this. I am also astonished at the number of hair/facial/nail/beauty establishments that seem to somehow survive along (and just off of) 37th Avenue. How do they all have sufficient business? There are almost as many of them as there are pharmacies and banks and cell phone stores. And that cannot be a high-margin business. I just don&#039;t get it.

				Yet again I will repeat. Times are changing due to online shopping. The whole of New York is facing this shift. Real world retail is dying. Slowly but surely. Online retail is thriving. (Where no store overheads like high commercial rent are necessary)<br /><br />Simply a fact of contemporary life.<br /><br />

				Except for food, I do all my shopping online.&nbsp; Two Jackson Heights stores that are in serious trouble are Vitaminshoppe and GNC.&nbsp; I&#039;m heavily into supplements and do all my shopping online at Vitacost with prices that are significantly less and free shipping over $49.&nbsp; GNC (Nationwide) won&#039;t be around much longer and is close to bankruptcy.&nbsp; Vitaminshoppe is doing better but will eventually follow GNC.&nbsp; And we all know about Payless Shoes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been accumulating Amazon stock for the past 4 years and I couldn&#039;t be happier with all the online shopping especially since they get the bulk of it. <br /><br />Yes, abcdefghijk, times are changing.&nbsp;

				Very surprised some people don&#039;t know we have a nice Yoga-Pilates studio already on 37th ave??<br /><br />How will a quaint bookstore afford to pay these very pricey rents in JH, and make a profit?&nbsp; Not realistic; as others have commented.<br /><br />Walk around midtown Manhattan to get a dose of retail wasteland, it is astounding...or google it to see the many articles on that topic. Because of my line of work, I am often reading about what is happening to brick &amp; mortar retail globally, because of online shopping.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs need to make a living, perhaps be more thoughtful about the businesses you think would thrive in JH. And MOST important, remember who we are, a family neighborhood, and the vast majority of residents here do not have high incomes. Average family in JH makes less than $60k <br /><br />

				Agree with comments on being realistic, retail is dying etc--but how do all these beauty and nail places survive the high rents? And the weird weight loss clinics? Seriously, in this neighborhood where the average family makes less than $60K--how do these places survive? You mean to tell me there are steady streams of people buying weight loss plans and fancy facials for top dollar in these places? And is Astoria a place where a bookstore can survive, but not in JH? Is there that huge of a difference in the demographics? There is now a bookstore in Kew Gardens, too. I understand why it&#039;s hard for any retail store to survive, but I don&#039;t get why many of the ones we have now seem to be able to.

				don&#039;t have a clue about weight loss clinics, but the nail/hair salons all do brisk business and most have a devoted clientele, and there&#039;s often a wait for service. a simple manicure is about $10, and a fancy gel one a bit more, but worth it to some. these aren&#039;t places that survive on pricey facials, they offer an inexpensive way for people -- when i&#039;m in for a mani, about one in five customers are male --&nbsp; to pamper themselves.

				&nbsp;I wonder if the online shopping will start to lag soon. Many younger people are concerned now with the <br />the effect of all this trucking, packaging and excess energy use that online purchases involve. Boxes, boxes everywhere! Environmentalists from long ago have been promoting buying local for some time <br />now (70&#039;s) and the biggest reason I think that still out there- shopping can be fun for many people.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I believe that customer service needs to be revived and that the experience of shopping in a place where people know their merchandise and can actually assist you would be something people would pay for and enjoy. If you paid your employees a good wage and gave them some ownership over the outcome that was not exactly commission, but a different evaluation of some sort, I think we could see some fine retailers survive and thrive. <br /><br />&nbsp; Just look at our local Green Market which I think is a huge success!

				Ingrid&#039;s is becoming a medical office? The former clothing store next to Table Wine is becoming a medical office. Both of them?<br /><br />KGDHP--the Kew Gardens bookstore came to be with the help of a GoFundMe campaign--or something like that. I contributed. I don&#039;t see why this cannot happen here, except for the issue of the rents, the landlords, the mysterious ways in which it can take years for a new business to open, even after a space has been secured. <br /><br />I simply don&#039;t believe that JH cannot support a bookstore, even though Astoria and Kew Gardens evidently can--and sure, why not a multi-lingual bookstore since JH is known for the many languages spoken. Hey, Lockwood seems to be making a go of it, and that&#039;s a pretty yuppified place (to use a term that reveals my age; who remembers yuppies?) I&#039;m happy there already is a Spanish bookstore, but since I don&#039;t speak Spanish, it does not help me. A bookstore would probably have to be located on a side street, not on a main drag---wherever a more reasonable rent can be found. Or even in an upstairs space, like 2nd Story Pilates? <br /><br />Some of the other ideas people have floated do seem unrealistic, but it seems to me that a bookstore might be feasible if an affordable location could be found.

				These discussions re:bookstores etc are recycled every year or two on this board.<br /><br />What confuses me is that I wonder what folks see when they walk along 37th Ave? <br /><br />I see a majority bustling IMMIGRANT neighborhood where immigrant folks arrive to pursue the American Dream. A neighborhood that is famously an immigrant hub. <br /><br />(Whether or not the American Dream exists is a separate discussion)<br /><br />We, who are not immigrants, we native English speakers, are clearly in the minority. <br /><br />And a bookstore, like the ones that exist in the UWS or Carroll Gardens or Soho or LIC or Astoria (which is a hip neighborhood) etc...kinda isn&#039;t realistic here...for the language disparity alone...<br /><br />But my Spanish has improved ten fold since moving here!

				What might work in this neighborhood is a not-for-profit book exchange/swap (no money involved)...bring a book, swap a book... <br /><br />...say every Sunday morning at Travis Park while the Farmer&#039;s Market is happening.<br /><br />Interestingly, in the South Bronx a book store has just opened, THE LIT BAR...founded by an African American woman...with a focus on African American authors/books/culture and that&nbsp; makes 100% sense.<br /><br />

Their windows are always interesting and creative and ever-changing. And make you want to go in. Inner Peace didn&#039;t capitalize that way. But it could&#039;ve.
