				Hey everyone, curbed.com (a great news/rumor source for NYC real estate) is having a best NYC neighborhood contest called the &quot;Curbed Cup&quot; and Jackson Heights is in the running! <br /><br />Go to http://www.curbed.com and scroll down to vote for our nabe. Right now JH needs the votes (JH 43.7% vs. FiDi 56.3%) so pass it along to your friends! <br /><br />In the previous round, JH beat Bushwick(Brooklyn) so FiDi may be a bigger challenge but we have more personality so there&#039;s a good chance we could make it!

				The comments on Curbed are very degrading towards Jackson Heights and immigrants in general. The zip code envy in this city is sad, bordering on deranged.

				I agree. It is shocking to see such blatant hatred and ignorance esp. from other New Yorkers. There were several comments though that were very supportive about JH and I think showed the ridiculousness of the negative comments.

				If this was your first time reading comments on Curbed posts, I can see why you&#039;d be surprised and disappointed.&nbsp; But the truth is that the comments always tend to be this way - no matter what the topic.&nbsp; For some reason, it&#039;s just the nature of the beast.

				I suppose the anonymity factor is part of why the comments are so cutting and rude. Not that it excuses the rudeness.

				I&#039;m not a real curbed reader and was very disappointed in a lot of the comments. It makes me sad to know that there&#039;s so much classism and racism in the world. I&#039;m new to this neighborhood (from Astoria), and though it has it&#039;s problems, there is such a sense of community here that I think my husband and I made a good choice about where to live.

				Fresh off defeating Bushwick and the Financial District in the Curbed Cup, Jackson Heights is now matched against Tribeca.&nbsp; This could be a bit harder.&nbsp; <br /><br />Visit Curbed and place your vote (http://curbed.com/archives/2007/12/13/curbed_cup_round_two_9_tribeca_vs_16_jackson_heights.php)!<br /><br />Polls close at noon on Friday.
