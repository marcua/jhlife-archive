				On October 25, 2016 the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved, with modifications, the proposed renovation of the former Clark’s women’s clothing store at 37-48 and 37-50 82nd Street.&nbsp; The two original buildings, constructed in 1929, had been dramatically altered over the years, with a new façade installed in the 1970s.&nbsp; Underneath the current façade is a buff-brick building that will be reconfigured into one store with Old Navy the planned tenant.&nbsp; The commission expressed concern over the building materials at the first-floor level, but ultimately the proposal was approved.&nbsp; The staff will work with the property owner on some items, including materials and the placement of windows.&nbsp; With this major structure restored, 82nd Street will now look better than it has in decades.&nbsp; We can all thank our landmark status for these improvements.<br /><br />(JHBG)

				So the the trifecta of brands under Gap Inc (Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap) are now represented on 82nd Street.&nbsp; Kudos to them for taking advantage of a business opportunity.<br /><br />I wonder how the addition of a major store like Old Navy will affect the already problematic issue of double parking on 82nd.&nbsp; I would recommend some degree of enforcement of this law.&nbsp; Especially as it is used by busses, ambulances and fire trucks.

				Is there a rule of thumb for who pays for this work? Is it the tenant or the building owner or some combination? <br /><br />Also: Does a single entity own all or a substantial part of 82nd St, or are all the buildings separately owned?

				Thank Scott for crediting JHBG on the landmark renovation update. It came from Dan Karatzis, who some of you know wrote the local&nbsp; history book, &quot;Jackson Heights, a Garden in the City.*) He stays on top of landmark and architecture issues for JHBG. <br /><br />JHBG hopes to push for extension of the landmark district, the long planned phase two in the coming year. If you are interested (landmarking is the only thing preventing inappropriate development here,) reach out to me directly at lenmaniace@gmail.com. Please put JH Landmark in subject line.<br /><br />Landmarks has had a proposal for several years, but has not yet begun its review. Councilman Dromm, Dan K. and I met with LPC&#039;s top official on this in 2015. It would be great to move it to the front burner. With your help we can.<br /><br />*Available at Jackson Heights&#039; finer book purveyors.
