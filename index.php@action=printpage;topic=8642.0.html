				I ordered sushi delivery from Kumo Japanese on seamlessweb last night after a long day, scarfed down half of it (it was rather tasty), put half in the fridge for today.&nbsp; Felt fine.<br /><br />This morning I go to eat the rest of it and as I&#039;m chewing I notice that what I thought was a stray piece of rice on one of the container lids was MOVING.&nbsp; Then noticed more.&nbsp; Grossest sushi experience ever, I can&#039;t believe I wolfed down half of it... my mother is right that I should eat slower.&nbsp; <br /><br />They even have an A grade.&nbsp; I called and told 311.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, just FYI and oh.my.gawd.<br />

				Really sorry to hear this. I probably wouldn&#039;t be able to eat for a week if this had happened to me.&nbsp; I hope they get investigated, especially the types of fish they are serving.&nbsp; Perhaps they are not serving sushi-grade fish, but rather just supermarket fish.&nbsp; I am not sure regular food safety inspectors would be able to pick this up?<br /><br />I have ordered a few times from various places on Seamless, and thought about ordering from Kumo, however, I checked the Yelp reviews prior to placing and order and they do not match AT ALL the reviews on Seamless.&nbsp; There were several 1 and 2 star reviews for this place on Yelp, and overall only gets 3 starts.&nbsp; On Seamless this place gets a 5-star average.&nbsp; I don&#039;t quite understand it.&nbsp; But anyway, I am glad I never ordered, and now I never will.<br /><br />On a related note, since I did not order from Kumo, I decided to place a regular phone order with Tomo Sushi here in Jackson Heights, and the order I got from them did not seem as good or fresh as what I had gotten from them in the past.<br /><br />edit: I checked the reviews again on Seamless, and out of the 40 people who posted reviews, 11 of those 40 were either 1 or 2 stars.&nbsp; Yet...magically this restaurant appears in the listing as having 5 stars.&nbsp; Seamless says this about their rating system:<br /><br /><em>This restaurant&#039;s overall star value is determined by comparing its ratings against those of other restaurants in the same city. A teacher might call this grading on a curve. At Seamless, this means that regardless of their actual tally, restaurants with the highest ratings will have five stars, those with average ratings will have three, and the not-so-favorite restaurants will have the least number of stars.</em>

				I&#039;d be terrified to eat anywhere that had 4 stars in that case.&nbsp; Yuck.<br /><br />I guess for now I&#039;ll stick to ordering sushi for lunch at work in the city. <br /><br />I was surprised they delivered to Jackson Heights... perhaps Astorians closer by have already learned their lesson.

				I don&#039;t know how long it takes a review to post but my review hasn&#039;t shown up yet. If the restaurant has any moderating capabilities that kind of defeats the purpose...

				I was going to suggest you post on Yelp, but I see you&#039;ve already done that. I notice they have a lot of &quot;1&quot; ratings. I know I&#039;ll stay away if I&#039;m ever looking for sushi in Astoria.

				This is really disgusting. It may not be the right answer but I think I&#039;ll stick to food that is cooked!

				Well, I just fainted, died, and then threw up.&nbsp; Mary P., you have my sympathy.&nbsp; I thought getting a molar in my pasta (not my own tooth) was the grossest thing ever until I read this.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				This is a little odd, we order delivery from there all the time and we always love what we get from there and have never had any problems after eating their food. Hopefully a one-off as I&#039;m not about to stop ordering from there it&#039;s one of our go-to&#039;s.
