				Hi everyone,<br /><br />A quick follow up to what may have been an intently watched listing. After failing to sell for 6 months with another firm, our listing at 35-33 76th Street was listed with us and entered contract in 5 weeks since we took it over. It closed at a record $940,000, highest sale as far as any closed sales that we could find. Only $8,500 below our list price. Second highest sold comp at Hawthorne Court standing at 920k. <br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-33-76th-street-unit-52/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-33-76th-street-unit-52/)<br /><br />Another similar example, our recent Hawthorne Court listing at 35-56 77th Street, Unit 32, also failed to sell for 6 months and was relisted with us at same price as previously listed. We had an accepted offer in two weeks and were in contract in two weeks after that:<br /><br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-56-77th-street-32/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/listings/35-56-77th-street-32/)<br /><br />Our 1 bed at Greystones asked $378,500 and received an accepted offer barely one week on market and has entered contract.<br /><br />All healthy market indicators, but we would like to take some credit given some of the past history of the two larger listings :) <br /><br />Any questions, please don&#039;t hesitate to reach out!<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen <br /><br />

				Do you think that the fact that it took so long to sell suggests that the apartment was overpriced?Why do you think that you are more successful than other brokers in finding able and willing buyers?

				The realtor is reluctant to reveal his trade secrets， LOL. My guess is to a better way to stage the apartment (wide angle photos and rearrange the furniture) to make the room feel bigger and brighter and also to get manhattan and Brooklyn people to visit the apartment

				Usually places sit on the market because they are overpriced. They may also have lousy photos and marketing plans that fail to bring in buyers.<br /><br />In JH, I think some people also make the mistake of using neighborhood agencies that don&#039;t do anything to reach the buyers in Brooklyn or Manhattan. Sellers may also sign bad deals where those local agencies have exclusive listings and don&#039;t allow co-broking.&nbsp;

				If I recall the Hawthorne listing it was priced over $1M originally. So the new broker lowered the price and it sold. Magic!<br /><br />This says more about the seller than the broker. Was the seller realistic in the first place about what the true value was? Did they fail to look closely at the original broker&#039;s valuation and take into account that if it sounds too good to be true it is?<br /><br />That&#039;s why it&#039;s so important to have at least three brokers in to give you an appraisal as to what they would sell the place for. You are bound to find the outlier broker in this crowd and, if you&#039;re smart, you won&#039;t sign with them.<br /><br />I was involved in a transaction where a broker said they could sell the place for $2.7M. Two others came in around $2M. Ultimately the place sold for $1.97M.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi everyone <br /><br />I am out of town at the moment, didn&#039;t realise there were replies and questions to this post. <br /><br />I for one am convinced that in today&#039;s electronic age few trade tools are a secret and choose to associate with a firm that and Real Estate board that believes in transparency, cooperation and sharing information. <br /><br />As far as quality of a marketing package, good copy and a floor plan is requisite baseline requirement for any property. <br /><br />In the case of Hawthorne 3Bed 2Bath listing, we listed at $948,500 (2.7% less less than previous list of $975,000) believing based on active and local comps to be a number we could hit or get close to. I am sure it was a contributing factor as well. Another that a fellow broker was working with a buyer who was the ultimate buyer with highest offer helped as well :) <br /><br />Second listing - 2bed, 2bath, we kept price virtually the same ... adjusted down by $500. <br /><br />Third we just pushed to do a bit better than last sale in the same building , one floor up, which was quite healthy...<br /><br />Basic tools of trade of all brokers are marketing tools, personal network, knowledge gained through schooling and trial and error. More experience = less errors :) I&#039;d personally love it to be magic too :) but I side with science on this one :)<br /><br />If market trend continues I am sure we will see higher sales get recorded , which will help quell appraisal concerns as well. Comps that appraiser used for Hawthorne listing were from the outside and adjusted as needed: <br /><br /><br />35-20 77 street unit #42 Sold $$900K closed 09/15/2016<br />Maintenance: $995 <br />$900,000<br />Sold (asking: $925,000.00 -2.7%)<br />3 beds•2 baths• appox 1,250 ft²<br /><br /><br />3327 80 street unit #31 sold $1,100K closed 01/10/2017<br />Maintenance : $1,389<br />4 beds 2 baths - these layouts are often listed as 3 bed + office <br />SF approx- 1500<br /><br /><br />3339 80 street unit #22 sold $1,085K closed 09/01/2016<br />4 bed 3 bath on second floor <br />Approx sf - 1500<br />Maintain:&nbsp; $1,588 <br /><br />3340 81 street unit #52 sold $955K closed 11/30/2016<br />4 beds 3 baths - same as #3<br />Maintain :&nbsp; $1,389<br /><br />3340 81 street unit #61 sold $965K closed 07/12/2016<br />Approx 1,386 ft²<br />3 beds 2 baths <br />Maintenance: $1,384 <br /><br />There are some properties under contract now in the area that may add to the comp pool, and some active listings too. <br /><br />Hope this is helpful<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><br />

I bet you it&#039;d go for close to $4M. Maybe $3M. You have to remove it from the context of Jackson Heights. Manhattan is much more expensive for many of the same things.

				As is always said，every home is unique. <br /><br />This one is right next to columbia, in a beautiful garden complex that occupies the city block of two full streets and one full Ave.<br />This 3bedroom/2bathroom apt also includes a balcony and there is a waiting list for parking.The asking price is about 1.1 million<br /><br />http://streeteasy.com/building/70-la-salle-street-new_york/9f<br /><br />Someone&#039;s definition of Manhattan only includes UES and UWS. They don&#039;t like anything near Columbia.<br /><br />When I bought my 2bedroom apartment about four years ago, a similar apartment in this garden complex was about 40% more expensive than Jackson heights. I actually made an offer in this complex but had to back out for other reasons.<br /><br />If I were to buy a three bedroom apartment now, I would buy this one rather than the Hawthorn count one.<br />

				What&#039;s really great about NYC...is that poor and the rich live next to each other.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t happen elsewhere.<br /><br />For instance, around Lincoln Center millionaires live in towers but within a few blocks, a stone&#039;s throw away are the projects.

				I think given Jackson Heights&#039; demographics and the high percentage of immigrants who likely also have higher ownership rates, the neighborhood will not change at the same pace and in the same dramatic fashion as, Brooklyn, for example. At least I hope so anyway. <br /><br />One of the reasons why I decided to move here, in addition to the convenience of transportation, square footage and layout of apartments for the $, is that it is truly a very diverse neighborhood with access to South American, Southeast Asian, South Asian and East Asian groceries and restaurants. And I think if they need to raise prices to sustain a living, so be it, I would think people who can afford to pay more than half a million for an apt can afford to pay more a few dollars more for an entree especially if those same people happily pay $30 for glorified adult Lunchables (charcuterie). <br /><br />

				People who pay the big bucks in JH are usually drawn to the private gardens and the small town feel of neighborhood.&nbsp; I think a lot of the new buyers/owners of JH&#039;s luxury apartments, i.e., Hawthorne, Towers, etc., are young families looking for a place to raise children.&nbsp; These are the same people who would live in Manhattan if they did not have kids.&nbsp; A private garden is a safe place to let your kids run around and have a glass of wine at the same time. Also, things are a lot cheaper in JH than in Manhattan - this matters when you are raising kids.

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />Best way I can contribute here would be to remain as factual as I can. As a rule most brokers do not release the actual contract price , or are too vocal about listings under contract, because we are probably too busy holding our breath and praying hard that the deal comes to a close as intended&nbsp; :D. Deals that pioneer the way of new pricing are truly fragile, as they have a greater margin of error to make it to the closing table. We can only hope that all the intricate financing and board approval pieces will fall into place. <br /><br />In regards to prices throughout, I certainly agree that mansion tax triggering price points (or those close to) are not a reflection of the entire Jackson Heights market presently, but rather a sector of the whole. <br /><br />I had written this article back in February of 2016 which sheds some light on the subject. <br />It&#039;s a quick read I promise :) I timed it :) <br />http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/hows-the-market/ (http://www.jacksonheightslistings.com/hows-the-market/)<br /><br />Hope you find it helpful<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen
