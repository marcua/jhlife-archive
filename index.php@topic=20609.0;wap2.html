			Dear Neighbors,<br /><br />As some of you know, there is a meditation circle that meets every Sunday in Jackson Heights to remember individuals of African descent who have been victims of systemic racist violence. As the group enters its second year of existence, we welcome others to join us. We host a 20 minute sitting, standing, and/or walking meditation at the intersection of 79th Street and 34th Avenue beginning at 9:30 a.m. followed by an opportunity for people to share reflections. We meet in all weather.<br /><br />The circle was originally activated by the murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and it continues to hold space to &quot;sit with&quot; the long history of systemic racism that haunts all arenas of life in the United States. We think of this spiritual practice of silence and remembrance as one of many actions necessary to grapple with the violence inflicted upon people of African descent on this continent since 1619. Please join us if you can, even if it&#039;s just for five minutes. And please share this information with others who might be interested.<br /><br />Best, <br />Lisa Jarnot, Susan Chapin, Walter Lyons, and Meredith Faltin<br /><br />
