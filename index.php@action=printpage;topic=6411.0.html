				It is unsightly.&nbsp; About two years ago the area had (and probably still does) a very serious rat problem.&nbsp; A local State Politician (I forget his name) got involved and was planning to educate the shop keepers and get the area cleaned up.&nbsp; Obviously, it never worked.&nbsp; The local Councilman&#039;s office should be contacted even though they must be aware of the problem since they&#039;re only two blocks away.&nbsp;

				I completely agree. Taking out of town guests on a tour of the neighborhood recently and this felt like a real abomination of smells and<br />sidewalk craziness. It&#039;s kind of nuts that the pathway gets reduced by 2/3&#039;s in some places. With all the attention to giving parking <br />tickets in this neighborhood( yes, I know, I know, it&#039;s a separate dept), can we not do something about the obstruction of sidewalk<br />problems as well. The people are great, the food and the wares are great but the behaviors of blocking the way and having it be<br />kinda dirty and smelly are not that great.

				Yes--totally agree!<br /><br />While we are on the topic of 73rd street, I also want to state how terrible it is to walk down 73rd (between 35th and 37th) when the building put out their trash.&nbsp; In the summertime the trash just reeks all night, sometimes not getting picked up until 8am.&nbsp; So gross--I wonder if anything can be done about it.&nbsp; The sidewalk is narrow and sometimes, I&#039;ve grazed the leaky trash bags as I was walking...

				Well not sure if this will help the cause but the Sanitation Dept plans on hiring<br />300 new workers starting from September through November. Yes, there main<br />priority over the winter is snow removal, but keeping the streets clean should<br />be a priority 24/7 year round.<br /><br />They are low in headcount as it is, if they hired more then you would see them<br />doing(MLP). Mobile Litter Patrol, they sweep sidewalks and curbs.

				That smell wafting from the garbage trucks is mostly the halal meat trash.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see the trash being loaded in to the garbage truck at least once a week from the shop across from the Ready Penny.<br /><br />They don&#039;t use sealed garbage bags...the rotting fat and other trimmings is dumped directly out of big plastic bins into the truck.&nbsp; When the wall of stench hits, you can see passersby gag and throw up in their mouths a little bit!

				Used to live on 73rd between 35th &amp; 37th...finally had teh good sense to sell and move to 78th street.&nbsp; It is like a different world.&nbsp; People who come to shop on 73rd street have bno respect for the nieghborhood.&nbsp; Trash, litter, half eaten food was always strewn about.&nbsp; Not to mention double parked cars, and honking cars.&nbsp; Something has to be done for the sake of the people who live there.&nbsp; If you see people throw something on the street, don&#039;t hesitate to tell them :&nbsp; &quot; Oh I think you might have dropped something.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe the sarecasm will be lost but it might help.

				I have to agree that this area of Jackson Heights brings down the whole neighborhood because of its smell and trash. A co-worker and I were talking about this area the other day and how neither of us walk west of 75th Street because of how gross it is. I don&#039;t understand why the shopkeepers and pedestrians in this area have no problems with the garbage, litter, half-eaten curry boxes, and pigeon sh*t that is caked to the sidewalk.

				I think it may also be fair to question the schedule of the sanitation department. I&#039;ve made the mistake in the past of attributing the lack of cleanliness to the residents of the effected area, but to follow that reasoning to its full conclusion is to believe that one group of people produce &quot;more&quot; trash than another, which i think is generally absurd. <br /><br />It&#039;s not unheard of that certain areas get better, and more punctual, service than others. Since immigrant neighborhoods are way less vocal and in touch or trusting of their local politicians, they are the first ones neglected by sanitation and police departments. <br /><br />Less cops, fewer trash cans, fewer trash pick-ups...what do you think is going to happen?<br />

				I&#039;m a little surprised at this thread. I&#039;m born and raised in JH, and lived most of the my life a block from 73rd Street, but I&#039;ve never thought of the area as being that bad in terms of sanitation. Perhaps I&#039;ve gotten used to it. Here are some of my thoughts:<br /><br />1) The smells that waft from 73rd Street from 35th Ave. and up are primarily from the regular trash that&#039;s put outside buildings twice a week. There&#039;s really not much you can do about it. The streets are narrow and the block is densely populated (tons of trash). <br /><br />2) I do have a complaint: the trash cans that are constantly overflowed. But that&#039;s because people are putting residential trash in those cans all the time. Also it&#039;s people in the neighborhood that are creating trash by littering. <br /><br />3) The fact is that it&#039;s an extremely vibrant and crowded shopping area with ethnic markets, restaurants and food trucks. There&#039;s no parking lot for visitors here. There&#039;s going to some measure of trash and noise around, and I don&#039;t see what&#039;s the big deal really. If the noise really bothers you, then get a pair of earplugs. I&#039;ve been using them forever for the car honking, etc.

				I agree. They both should be pedestrian zones. I don&#039;t know however if that would remedy the garbage. I noticed this morning&nbsp; that most of the merchants on 37Th Ave. do not clean in the front of their stores and many people flagrantly litter. What you need here is enforcement. Despit the effort of the garden club people who do the plantings in the tree surrounds, the majority were not cleaned this morning by any of the merchants. I just don&#039;t get it. It takes two minutes to do and makes a positive impact. Here you have people planting and doing periodic cleaning to make their store look inviting.

				&quot;Seasons Greetings&quot; everyone!<br /><br />There are now Christmas decorations on 73rd St b/w 37th Ave and B&#039;way.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why...maybe somebody couldn&#039;t find tacky decorations for Eid il Fitr (they do exist...I have seen them in Muslim countries during Ramadan).&nbsp; Somebody paid for these, and presumably they could put some of that money and energy into cleaning up the street.<br /><br />IMO, there are focal building that are relatively new and cause much more filth than the rest:<br /><br /><strong>Haat Bazaar</strong> and the <strong>Bangladesh Plaza</strong> next to it.<br /><br />Haat Bazaar specializes in cheap produce that is about to go bad (thus the low price)...they are constantly blocking the sidewalks with deliveries, their own produce stands turned around to prop open doors, and rotten produce.&nbsp; The sidewalk is black and slick from the accumulated decomposition.&nbsp; They also do much more business than that little store can handle (it has produce, halal meat, a restaurant, and dry goods), and will be a problem until they move to an appropriate place.<br /><br />Bangladesh Plaza is a lot of little businesses, and no one bothers to keep the front of the building clean as do other, larger businesses.&nbsp; The fire hydrant in front is a popular hang-out until the early morning, and for some reason people throw trash around the hydrant as if it were a garbage can.<br /><br />The Sheila Terrace is apparently having a meeting with Dromm&#039;s office and CB3 in their lobby today at 5:30 PM.&nbsp; I probably can&#039;t go, but maybe some plans for approaching the issue will come out of it.

				I am glad that this situation on 73rd Street is getting attention from local officials. And as to the notion of authenticity with the<br />mess and the behavior, this is farcical. There are shopping districts in so many areas that are enticing with smells, not repugnant,<br />and that allow you to walk easily down the street if you are not shopping then. Travel my friend. Then come back and see how<br />we can improve this problem on 73rd st. so all can prosper. It&#039;s entirely solvable.

				I was thrilled to see this article re the folks at Sheila Terrace and would be even more thrilled to see Co-op, Condo, Private Home and Renters band together and make our voices heard regarding quality of life issues in JH heard. I&#039;m going to call Peralta&#039;s office.

				Hmm...I had to think long and hard about the issues at hand here and here is my humble opinion:<br /><br />I am sorry that the people of Sheila Terrace feel like their street has changed but the truth is, in an urban environment, neighborhoods and streets can change over time.&nbsp; That&#039;s what happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, there should definitely be steps taken to help clean up the area.&nbsp; Perhaps an alliance can be forged with the vendors and the business owners to take care of the area.&nbsp; A meeting should be held with all parties present.&nbsp; If there are complaint meetings, how can cooperation be expected.<br /><br />But I feel uneasy to think that what I am hearing is essentially people saying that they have more of a right to the street than the other people who occupy it.&nbsp; The business owners and their customers have just as much of a right to be there.&nbsp; It might be too &quot;exotic&quot; for some people but honestly, as someone else mentioned before, it&#039;s one of the best things about the neighborhood.&nbsp; I live on 73rd between 37th and 35th so almost of all my visitors come down 73rd to see me.&nbsp; Everyone loves the area--the sights, the smells, the sounds.&nbsp; I happen to love seeing the street vendors and all the crazy sights and sounds.&nbsp; I love that these stores are open late or 24 hours--I feel safe when I walk home late at night.&nbsp; It is what makes New York City great--these people made a street their own.&nbsp; <br /><br />It might be nice to have everything be white-washed and so-called historic but this is New York City!&nbsp; There are plenty of &quot;clean,&quot; gentrified blocks to move to, if needed...

				&quot;I understand that they have different standard in terms of cleaness but they have to realize that the street is shared by people from other cultures and they can&#039;t force their standard to the public street.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br /><br />Like the above quote is kinda ugly...&quot;They&quot; have different standards of cleanliness?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Also what was said about &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings, everyone&quot;--&nbsp; Why is it such a bother to you if some people put up a &quot;Season&#039;s Greetings&quot; sign?&nbsp; And who knows who paid for that sign or how it was paid for?&nbsp; <br /><br />As long as you regard your ethnic neighbors as being second-class citizens with no standards, you&#039;re not going to get anywhere.&nbsp; A little respect in terms of discourse might go a long way and might lead to productive collaboration in cleaning up the neighborhood.&nbsp; You can attract a lot more bees with honey, my friends.<br /><br />

				Evaviva, you didn&#039;t go to the meeting so I&#039;m afraid your comments don&#039;t reflect reality.&nbsp; That meeting included at least 50 people representing every ethnic group in Jackson Heights (and they weren&#039;t just from Sheila Terrace, also from Birchwood House across the street), including Bangladeshis and Indians that are fed up with folks trashing the street.&nbsp; Some of the business owners are also fed up because the problem-makers just buy one cup of tea and hang out blocking their entrances all night, not to mention the congestion from too much circling traffic and competition from illegal vendors.<br /><br />What we are talking about here is a half-block in an otherwise wonderful neighborhood where anything is allowed.&nbsp; Businesses and both illegal and legal vendors appropriate much more of the sidewalk than they are permitted.&nbsp; Huge illuminated signs are left on all night, even when businesses are closed. People throw trash anywhere they want (and it is more than just an issue of trashcans; people throw things on the ground within sight of trashcans that are not full).&nbsp; <br /><br />People loiter until the early morning hours yelling, blasting music, and smoking outside apt windows near street level.&nbsp; There are also people dealing drugs and getting wasted behind the cell phone store.&nbsp; Mattresses are thrown in the alley for sex.&nbsp; And on and on.<br /><br />Let&#039;s face it.&nbsp; If one-tenth of what goes on along this half block were happening in the precious historic district, the cops would be all over it.&nbsp; If the folks trashing the street and loitering all night were black or hispanic rather than South Asian the cops would be all over it (not saying that is right, just pointing out the double standard).&nbsp; Look at the over-reaction to a little soccer celebrating on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; We get no reaction on 73rd St.&nbsp; Two auxiliary cops walking around would eliminate most problems very quickly.<br /><br />Danny Dromm has sent a letter to the residents of the block encouraging a 311 campaign, followed by calling their office with the reference number so they can follow up.&nbsp; They also encourage a block association, which hopefully we can get going so that the several hundreds of residents of Sheila and Birchwood can have their interests represented alongside the businesses that increasingly control 73rd St.<br /><br />P.S. We have the right to complain on this board.&nbsp; The &quot;Seasons Greetings&quot; decorations are the same tacky crap that are put up in Little Italy to appeal to tourists.&nbsp; One of the support poles actually fell over during the meeting mentioned above.

				Another thing that was mentioned by many people at the meeting: physical intimidation by the vendors.&nbsp; Many residents of Sheila Terrace tried approaching them with concerns and were immediately surrounded by vendors from multiple carts and tables in a threatening manner.&nbsp; Some movers that were bringing furniture into Birchwood had to call the police on one occasion due to threats (I witnessed this one myself...particularly ugly as they were along the lines of &quot;I&#039;m a Muslim and you don&#039;t know what I could do to you&quot;.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t work to bring individual concerns...we need collective action.

				I live in the &quot;precious historic district&quot; on 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#039;s not quite as bad as 73rd street (which seems to have it&#039;s own unique set of problems) but I guarantee you that the &quot;precious historic district&quot; is NOT getting any special treatment or attention.&nbsp; Garbage overflows from cans, retailers blast music out into the street and those horrible LED signs glow all night.&nbsp; If things are a little better it&#039;s because the residential buildings take care of their properties and the areas in front of them.&nbsp; For that matter 82nd street is in the historic district and you see what a train wreck that&#039;s become.&nbsp; Seriously I wish some posters on this site would can it with the anti-&quot;gentrification&quot; and anti-ownership rants.&nbsp; My husband and I own our apartment, went to college but are far from &quot;The Man&quot; people in JH are so desperately afraid of.&nbsp; I work 12-14 hour days to pay my bills and shop at costco just like the rest of you. We invested in the neighborhood by buying our apartments, serving on our building&#039;s board, shopping at local stores and using local services and making friends with our neighbors.

				&quot;I live here too&quot;, I don&#039;t think anyone on this thread is anti-ownership.&nbsp; The meeting was organized by coop shareholders in two buildings on 73rd St, many of whom have owned ever since the buildings went coop.&nbsp; Only in the last few years have things really become out of hand on 73rd St...the owners in these buildings and their neighbors have always had good relations but now they are deteriorating.&nbsp; The whole point is to get back to some harmony.&nbsp; Feelings might be hurt along the way, but that is life.<br /><br />Compare to 74th St, which is more vibrant and interesting in a lot of ways but cleaner and quiets down after 11 PM.&nbsp; As was expressed at the meeting, 73rd St residents would love to have something approaching the 74th St situation.&nbsp; How do we make that happen?<br /><br />Yes, 82nd St has problems, but the 82nd St block between 37th Ave and Roosevelt is almost all commercial.&nbsp; There are not several hundred residents on that block as on 73rd.&nbsp; 82nd St also has a police officer assigned to patrol...rare is the day you will see a cop on 73rd, even driving through.

				I see--I didn&#039;t realize the situation was that bad. &nbsp;I never saw the cell phone store house area so I concur that it has to be stopped. &nbsp;I&#039;m glad the meeting had representation from a lot of parties. &nbsp;I hope this gets resolved and the streets get cleaned up-literally and figuratively-soon!<br /><br />I hail from an Italian background but my sister-in-law (who I am very close with) is a Bangladeshi Muslim. &nbsp;We&#039;re both really surprised that people would say, &quot;I&#039;m Muslim and you don&#039;t know what I can do to you&quot; to people, especially in light of the fact that a lot of Muslims feel really afraid all the time. &nbsp;<strong>NYC Peromyscus</strong>, I sort of think that you make sweeping blanket statements about things in the neighborhood that can appear to border on racism and bigotry. &nbsp;I am not sure if you harbor some sort of inner dislike for the ethnic population of 73rd street, etc. (as a viewing of your history of comments would seem to indicate) or if that is just my perception. &nbsp;I apologize if I am perceiving your comments incorrectly and I do hope that is the case. &nbsp;It is a little bizarre to me that many people would come up and &quot;I&#039;m a Muslim and you don&#039;t know what I can to you&quot; sort of comments as well as I think it is bizarre that multiple people have &quot;coughed&quot; in your face on 73rd street. &nbsp;I have lived here for 7 years now as have many close friends. &nbsp;We were all looking at this board together last night over some wine and, frankly, your Jackson Heights experiences seem a bit exaggerated and propelled by what might be a dislike of the ethnic populations that inhabit corners of Jackson Heights. &nbsp;Like I&#039;ve always said, we should definitely clean things up and make the neighborhood as beautiful and nice as possible but if you&#039;re looking for a gentrified block with &quot;controlled exoticness,&quot; this might not be it for you...<br /><br />I seriously am not trying to offend anyone here--I totally see your point of view, residents.&nbsp; Action should be taken.&nbsp; As a resident of 73rd street, I would like to see things being cleaner too.&nbsp; I just think that calling signs &quot;tacky&quot; or commenting on hygienic habits of a group of people is a little ugly.&nbsp; Think about what you are saying and why you might be saying it...

				The &quot;I&#039;m a Muslim&quot; comment was made by one individual to another individual...I saw it happen.&nbsp; You can believe or not believe.&nbsp; I think the signs are tacky...they are Christmas decorations that were repurposed.&nbsp; I don&#039;t like cheap Christmas decorations.&nbsp; My post about people coughing in my face is an observation...I have also narrowly missed being spat upon on multiple occasions.&nbsp; My opinion is that one should cover one&#039;s mouth when coughing on the street, and not spit in proximity to others (or at all on the street unless you can&#039;t help it).<br /><br />My family is half south Asian and it&#039;s&nbsp; a big reason why we live in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Your accusation of racism is ridiculous.&nbsp; Multiculturalism has jumped the rails when one can&#039;t criticize public cleanliness without the race card being pulled.

				In some ways, itâ€™s a little hard to assess how serious this problem is. I totally understand complaints about things like loud noise very late at night when people are trying to sleep and accumulated garbage.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />On the other hand, I donâ€™t see how holiday decorations -- however â€œtackyâ€ -- are a serious concern.&nbsp; Itâ€™s just part of the neighborhood mix. <br />Also -- being coughed on is obviously not pleasant but it is something that inevitably happens in a city like NY, whether in Jackson Heights or elsewhere.&nbsp; I pass along 73rd Street every so often and have never noticed a major problem -- but I guess if I was living there I might have a different view point.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have to say, though, I donâ€™t see any real problem on 82nd Street, which is close to home and which I walk along every day&nbsp; (donâ€™t understand why 82nd Street would ever be considered a train wreck as someone said above).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

				EvaViva, I think your points are lost when you use this coded &quot;race card&quot; language:<br /><br /><em>It might be too &quot;exotic&quot; for some people <br />It might be nice to have everything be white-washed <br />There are plenty of &quot;clean,&quot; gentrified blocks to move to, if needed...<br />if you&#039;re looking for a gentrified block with &quot;controlled exoticness,&quot; </em><br /><br />This seems more designed to put people you disagree with back on their heels than anything else.&nbsp; To me, this is about respect, pure and simple.&nbsp; What I see on 73rd Street isn&#039;t the product of race or ethnicity, it&#039;s the result of people who don&#039;t show any respect for our community.&nbsp; If you live here, you shouldn&#039;t be using our streets as a garbage can.&nbsp; If you are visiting, you shouldn&#039;t be using our streets as a garbage can.&nbsp; And if I criticize the people who treat our community as a garbage dump, it&#039;s not because they are too &quot;exotic&quot; for me, or because I want to &quot;white-wash&quot; the neighborhood, it&#039;s because it&#039;s the right thing to do.<br />

				Trash, littering, illicit activities, drug dealing, urinating, etc: NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND HALTED. &nbsp;Totally not acceptable.<br /><br />Random comments about &quot;threatening&quot; street vendors (the majority of whom seem to be extremely elderly men over the age of 65) on 73rd, tacky ethnic decorations, being supposedly consistently spat on and coughed at, limiting store hours to your liking: I&#039;m not so sure how productive or valid these are in terms of complaints and battles. &nbsp;<br /><br />Welcome to NYC, folks. &nbsp;There&#039;s always Greendale, Wisconsin if you want it to be tailor-made to your liking. &nbsp;That&#039;s my home-town and I left it because everything was too perfect--the stores close at 8pm promptly, everyone&#039;s lawn is perfectly mowed, almost everyone looks and acts the same and the sidewalk is clean enough to eat off of. &nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of the very threatening and hateful street vendors that are mentioned, I notice that some of the elderly men physically haul their street carts with much difficulty. &nbsp;One of the men hauls it up 73rd street every early afternoon and it takes him so long to get his cart there that it&#039;s hard to watch. &nbsp;He has to take long rests. &nbsp;I once bought an incense holder from him and asked him why he does it every day; he said he needs it to pay his room share rent because no one will hire him because he&#039;s so old. &nbsp;He&#039;s not an illegal immigrant, just a green card holder who apparently left a very poor village in Bangladesh. &nbsp;He was so horribly threatening to me that at the end of our conversation, he gave me free beads (like rosary or something). &nbsp;So remember that some of these people are just trying to make a living. &nbsp;By some turn of fate, we were born into situations where we are coop share-holders and have time, money and ability to post on this board. &nbsp;Any one of us could have easily been in that old man&#039;s shoes. &nbsp;And no, he didn&#039;t spit on me or threaten to destroy me in some Muslim way at the end our conversation.

				And one last thing about the garbage issue:&nbsp; I also notice that the garbage cans are overflowing and that garbage does not get picked up in a timely manner on that street.&nbsp; I think that just adds to the problem when you have so much foot traffic.&nbsp; Matters might be helped if the Department of Sanitation paid a little bit more attention to that street.<br /><br />Maybe there can be a campaign to encourage people to be clean--signs in Hindi, Urdu and Bangla stating, &quot;Please throw your trash away&quot; along with extra trash cans. I&#039;m a social psychologist and there are numerous studies that indicate that reminders in the forms of signs can have surprisingly good effects.&nbsp;

				This thread has totally gone Godwin with the race card thing.<br /><br />Everyone agrees we need to move forward productively. &nbsp;But again, as you say this is NYC. &nbsp;Feelings will get hurt, and we all have different complaints. &nbsp;My complaints about the decorations were a throwaway comment that EvaViva made a big deal about...the coughing thing is from a totally different thread! &nbsp;Don&#039;t bring up tangential issues and then blame everyone else when the thread goes astray.<br /><br />I mainly posted what people said AT THE MEETING about the vendors, crime, littering, etc. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think they were lying...maybe exaggerating in some cases. &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t matter...there are quality of life issues that apply in NYC and everywhere else.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope folks at the Sheila and Birchwood can get our act together to make a block association.<br /><br />A sign is a great idea...throw Punjabi, English and Spanish on there as well!<br /><br />Does anyone know folks from the JBBA or other local business organizations?&nbsp; Anybody from there on this board?! &nbsp;We really need to meet with them. &nbsp;The JBBA website doesn&#039;t have anything about working with the community...it seems mostly to be a group for business owners to help each other out. &nbsp;But maybe they are interested...<br /><br />http://www.jbbany.com/ (http://www.jbbany.com/)

				thanks chuckster.<br /><br />i agree that 73rd is dirty. but so is 8th street in the village, 5th avenue in park slope and on and on, none of which are culturally caused....just density-driven. i honestly think that the street vendors are a tiny part of the problem, when compared to the large brick and mortar vendors, from subzi mandi to dynasty deli to duane reade to mcdonald&#039;s and subway. the trash has plenty of cigarette packs, lay&#039;s bags, soda cans and other things that the vendors don&#039;t sell.<br /><br />and i agree, and have pointed out a number of times over the years here -- much to the angst of some of my neighbors -- that some (not all) of the comments on this topic verge on the racist. we all have our blind spots: as someone who was raised dirt poor and worked up to middle class, mine would have to be what i perceive (correctly or not) as &quot;the entitled class.&quot;<br /><br />no one should be abused. no one should have garbage thrown at their homes. no one should have to deal with horrible living conditions. but no one should move into a place and try to displace those who&#039;ve been there for years.

				The residents of Birchwood and Sheila Terrace are a mix of new residents (maybe one-third) that have moved here in the last five years, and then primarily very long-time residents of all races (including about 20% South Asian).&nbsp; Many agree that the half-block up for discussion here has become much worse in just the last few years.<br /><br />Certainly these facts complicate the narrative that often pops up here that anyone who wants &quot;change&quot; is a newcomer trying to displace long-time residents.&nbsp; If anything it is probably the opposite in this case, i.e. the business interests have prevailed over residential interests on 73rd St for several years running now.&nbsp; Helen Sears was one of the big supporters of these business interests...folks here might remember the Western Jackson Heights Alliance (maybe I&#039;m forgetting the exact name) that was formed as a counterbalance.&nbsp; Many of the businesses are quite new.&nbsp; The density of businesses on the street just becomes greater and greater, and we&#039;re about to get more from the shops that will open in the defunct Eagle theater space.<br /><br />

The new buildings that have been built on that block are much, much larger than the buildings they replaced. &nbsp;There is now a 7 story building where there was just one private house and this happened in just the past few years. &nbsp;It&#039;s hard to know what could be done though if city planning doesn&#039;t step in to alter the zoning.<br /><br />I agree that money and &quot;business interests&quot; are trumping those of residents by a lot. &nbsp;<br />

				73/74 Street is a thriving commercial area -- centered around a major transit hub (one of the biggest and busiest in the City).&nbsp; The â€œmoney and business interestsâ€ here are mostly small, local merchants and entrepreneurs who are trying to make a living (and who may not have the option of a white collar job in Manhattan).&nbsp; To the extent their businesses are expanding, this will provide jobs and opportunity for people and help keep the neighborhood vital.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are numerous other parts of Jackson Heights, further away from the subway, that are entirely residential and are very tranquil, orderly and elegant -- which is one of the great things about the neighborhood.&nbsp; But Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s reasonable to expect that same level of peace and quiet in a building thatâ€™s smack in the middle of the commercial district. <br />

				If Haat Bazaar has decided to cram so many counters into its business that it&#039;s essentially annexed the public sidewalk or the butcher&#039;s just north of 37th decides to dump chicken fat on the sidewalk, there&#039;s nothing cultural about that. It&#039;s just a business owner taking advantage of the community. And it&#039;s the role of the community to say &quot;enough.&quot;<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing culturally determined about leaving rotting vegetables and meat scraps around. If you go into a Bengali home, you don&#039;t typically find a lot of rotting vegetables and meat scraps. It&#039;s just business owners making a calculation that sanitation codes won&#039;t be enforced and they can be lazy. That&#039;s all. Nothing cultural about that.<br /><br />As many people point out, 74th Street doesn&#039;t smell like a sewer, and it isn&#039;t unwalkable. Neither does 37th Avenue between 73rd and 75th. Neither does Richmond Hill. There is absolutely nothing about a South Asian business district that needs to smell like vomit. There are a few individual bad actors who are running their businesses in an unsanitary fashion. They need to be talked to, and if they can&#039;t work with the community, cracked down upon.

				Here&#039;s an article from the Queens Chronicle following-up on another meeting between the residents and merchants on 73rd Street.<br /><br />On 73rd Street, â€˜We have to cooperateâ€™ (http://www.qchron.com/news/western/on-rd-street-we-have-to-cooperate/article_e44f8a0e-3b2e-5cbf-be00-ac3ad627d8a0.html)<br /><br />
