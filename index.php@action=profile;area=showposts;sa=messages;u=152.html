					<strong>Queens Paideia Announces $150,000 Scholarship Program</strong><br /><br /><strong>Long Island City, NY, December 4, 2013 </strong> Queens Paideia School, known for its 6:1 student-teacher ratio and fully individualized education that emphasizes strong academics, thinking skills, and self-management skills, announces a Merit Scholarship program worth a total of $150,000. Students 13 and up are eligible to apply for the 2014-15/16 school year. The school is holding an open house on the morning of December 18 for interested candidates and their parents/guardians.<br /><br />Dr. Francis Mechner, director of QPS and president of the Mechner Foundation, founded the school “to provide the best possible--and most complete--education for children and to demonstrate the amazing results that an individualized education can deliver. We are funding the scholarship program to add seven promising students to our secondary school.” Selected applicants will be interviewed and evaluated on their abilities and personal qualities.<br />Queens Paideia School is an independent K-12 school located in Long Island City. Its highly regarded team of educators focuses detailed attention on every student. “We spotlight every student’s unique potentials and talents,” explains Mechner, “preparing them for college but also for a successful, fulfilling life.” Adds Dr. Tim Fredrick, QPS’s ELA instructor: “Our students learn to be critical thinkers and to ask questions of the world and themselves. That is what makes them stand out.”<br /><br />Three $30,000 scholarships will cover the 2014-16 school years, and four $15,000 scholarships will cover the 2014-15 school year. <br /><br />The Mechner Foundation has been supporting educational, scientific, and cultural activities since 1996. Further information and the application form can be found at <a href="http://queenspaideiaschool.org/process/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://queenspaideiaschool.org/process/</a>.

					Queens&#039; First Ever Literary Journal Seeks Poetry and Prose from Queens Writers of all ages, all backgrounds.<br /><br />Newtown Literary is a new semi-annual literary journal published in electronic and paper formats. We look for fiction, creative nonfiction, essays, and poetry that go beyond entertainment and storytelling.&nbsp; The pieces we include for publication have struck us on a deep level.&nbsp; Pieces that juxtapose humor with grief, tell untold love stories, and replace clichÃ© with innovation are examples of works that will find a home in Newtown Literary.<br /><br />Newtown, the journal&#039;s namesake, was one of the original towns incorporated into the New York City borough of Queens in 1898. Newtown Literary is dedicated to writers from and writing about Queens, NY and allocates half the journal to these writers and their work.&nbsp; But this is not our exclusive focus, as we recognize that Queens is just as much a state of mind as it is a geographic boundary.&nbsp; The diversity of Queens is our inspiration and we hope to fill the journal with diverse stories, experiences, and voices.&nbsp; <br /><br />The inaugural issue of Newtown Literary arrives late Fall 2012.&nbsp; Submission deadline for this issue is August 4th.&nbsp; For submissions guidelines and to submit, visit <a href="http://www.newtownliterary.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.newtownliterary.org/</a> or email <a href="mailto:editor@newtownliterary.org" class="bbc_email">editor@newtownliterary.org</a>.<br />

					Creative Expressions<br /><br />This 8-week after-school guides student-writers--enthusiastic and reluctant alike--toward the skill, and joy, of using language creatively to express ideas, feelings, and experiences. Instructor Tim Fredrick brings humor and pinpoint precision to assessing and teaching a small group of students, who come together weekly for a series of exercises that will hone their ability to play with language and discover new ways to use words and sentences. The ongoing result is greater mindfulness of word choice, expressive connections, and the confidence that comes from improvement in these areas.<br /><br />At the end of the course, students will present works from their final portfolios and walk away with the awareness that they can apply their growing skills to all types of writing and presentation formats.<br /><br />There are 2 sections, both of which have 1-2 spots left. Class are comprised of students from Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn.<br /><br />1. Monday afternoons, 3:45-4:45<br />2. Tuesday afternoons, 3:45-4:45<br /><br />All classes held at the LIC Art Center, 44-02 23rd Street, 2nd floor. Accessible by the E/M/F/R subways. 1st stop in Queens. <br /><br />Cost: $160 for 8 sessions, STARTS WEEK OF APRIL 16.<br /><br />For more information, contact <a href="mailto:info@queenspaideiaschool.org" class="bbc_email">info@queenspaideiaschool.org</a>.<br /><br />________<br />Tim Fredrick, PhD, is a has taught elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as college undergraduates and graduates. Through his wide range of experience, he understands how language is acquired, how literacy is improved, and the latest best practices for encouraging both. He has a masterâ€™s degree in English Education, and a PhD in Applied Linguistics from New York University. Mr. Fredrick has been published in international academic journals and regularly presents (in the United States and abroad) his research on language use.

There is an official flyer for the contest, so if you can forward this or the flyer (e-mail <a href="mailto:kidsart@licartsopen.org" class="bbc_email">kidsart@licartsopen.org</a> to get it) to your children&#039;s schools, we&#039;d really appreciate it!<br /><br /><strong>Green Queens <br />Just Look at What Is Around Us!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />The 2012 LIC Arts Open is a weeklong festival in May of open art studios, exhibitions, and free performances. LICAO wants to pull in Queensâ€™ best &amp; brightest artists through a contest organized specifically for its young people (K-12). Last yearâ€™s Queensboro Bridge Contest resulted in 1,500 cards that formed a memorable mosaic of color, perspective, and talent. We hope even more young people will get involved this year!<br /><br />WHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All students in Queens, ages 5-18<br /><br />WHAT Submit artwork that shows the ways in which Queens is Green! Think--<br /><br />for younger kidsâ€” <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardens and parks<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trees and flowers<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green houses, cars, signs for older kids, perhapsâ€”<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable buildings <br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean transportation modes<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White rooftops, rooftop gardens<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found-object art<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy conservation<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local food<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewable energy<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean water for recreation and marine life<br />â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composting and other practices that cut down on waste<br /><br />â€”and so much more we constrained adult minds canâ€™t even imagine!<br /><br />The subject of the postcards should tie into something in Queens that makes you think Green. We encourage artists (and instructors, if an in-school project) to think about what Green Queens means to them, and to express their ideas in any medium they choose within the 5 x 7&quot; postcard format.<br /><br />WHEN&nbsp; Submissions are due April 20, 2012. Winners will be contacted on May 5, and invited to an awards ceremony to be held at the May 19 Street Fair in LIC. ALL entries will be exhibited May 12â€“20 at the LIC Art Center, 5th floor, as part of the Arts Open.<br /><br />SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br />-LICAO Kids Art Committee will supply 5 x 7&quot; blank 10pt postcards to participating children and schools. You may use your own stock if it is of comparable weight.<br />-Include on the back of each submission artist&#039;s name/age/school (if applicable) and a contact e-mail address so we can notify winners. <br />-Artwork can be picked up as of May 20. LICAO can also mail them if the artist includes his/her address and a $.32 stamp on the back side, as if it were a postcard. If a school sends a large number of cards, a representative can pick them up at the LIC Art Center during the week after the Open. Because of the large number of submissions, LICAO cannot take responsibility for the return of cards beyond what is described here.<br />-Submissions must be received by April 20, 2012, either mailed to the contest curator or dropped off at the LIC Art Center.<br /><br />For More Information, visit <a href="http://www.LICArtsOpen.com--or" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.LICArtsOpen.com--or</a> contact us at <a href="mailto:kidsart@licartsopen.org" class="bbc_email">kidsart@licartsopen.org</a>.<br /><br />Bertille de BaudiniÃ¨re, LICAO Childrenâ€™s Art Curator<br />Queens Paideia School<br />44-02 23rd Street, Studio 214<br />Long Island City, NY 11101

					Creative Expressions<br /><br />This 8-week after-school guides student-writers--enthusiastic and reluctant alike--toward the skill, and joy, of using language creatively to express ideas, feelings, and experiences. Instructor Tim Fredrick brings humor and pinpoint precision to assessing and teaching a small group of students, who come together weekly for a series of exercises that will hone their ability to play with language and discover new ways to use words and sentences. The ongoing result is greater mindfulness of word choice, expressive connections, and the confidence that comes from improvement in these areas.<br /><br />At the end of the course, students will present works from their final portfolios and walk away with the awareness that they can apply their growing skills to all types of writing and presentation formats.<br /><br />There are 2 sections:<br /><br />1. Monday afternoons, 3:45-4:45 (this section is almost full)<br />2. Tuesday afternoons, 3:45-4:45<br /><br />All classes held at the LIC Art Center, 44-02 23rd Street, 2nd floor. Accessible by the E/M/F/R subways. 1st stop in Queens. <br /><br />Cost: $160 for 8 sessions, STARTS WEEK OF APRIL 16.<br /><br />For more information, contact <a href="mailto:info@queenspaideiaschool.org" class="bbc_email">info@queenspaideiaschool.org</a>.<br /><br />________<br />Tim Fredrick, PhD, is a has taught elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as college undergraduates and graduates. Through his wide range of experience, he understands how language is acquired, how literacy is improved, and the latest best practices for encouraging both. He has a masterâ€™s degree in English Education, and a PhD in Applied Linguistics from New York University. Mr. Fredrick has been published in international academic journals and regularly presents (in the United States and abroad) his research on language use.
