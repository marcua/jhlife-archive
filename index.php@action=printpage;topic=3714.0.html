				By the way, if you want to be notified about programs and opportunities the city is implementing, city-sponsored events and seminars, etc. -- just sign up for the email version of &quot;my nyc.gov news&quot; at https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/ .

				Interesting.&nbsp; I wonder if a block that has a school on it can have a teacher and their class apply.&nbsp; Probably too late this year but there&#039;s always the next ...

				$500 could probably help fix a few of the broken benches on Northern Blvd.

				If you have the time on Monday, it might be worth an email or phone call to the people who are administering this.&nbsp; It&#039;s always possible that they did not receive enough applications and might be willing to give extra time.&nbsp; Also it&#039;s not a bad idea to get on their radar screen for next year if this year doesn&#039;t work out.<br /><br />I wish I had seen the announcement earlier to give people here time to get their applications together.
