				Thanksgiving is coming up! Does anyone know the best place to get a turkey? I don&#039;t have much freezer space, so I want to buy it as close to Thanksgiving as possible, without of course, losing any chance of getting a turkey! Is Walbaums or Trade Fair my best bet, or is there a better option I&#039;m not thinking of?<br /><br />And, seeing how I&#039;m a Thanksgiving hosting noob... when should I buy it? How long will it take to defrost in the fridge?

				K and T Butchers in Astoria is by far the best place. Its on Broadway around 37th Street. You can order in advance and just pick it up days before. You&#039;ll get a fresh, never frozen bird. Since my husband is vegetarian, I don&#039;t each much meat, generally...but then I decided to only buy meat from K &amp;T.(supermarket meat, color, slime, and packaging freaks me out and I end up empty handed) I head over there about twice a month-really its the best! Plus, you&#039;d be supporting a small, local business with a bunch of fabulous employees. I was trying to compete for a trip with Anthony Bourdain, so I had to make a video, and the guys at K&amp;T gave me a grand tour, answered questions, and were just funny and great. <br />First you order, then they give you a ticket, you pay the lady in the booth in back, then you give your receipt back to the butcher, who gives you your stuff.

				Not sure if I was clear- you pre-pay for the bird, then you can pick it up anytime up until 7PM Thanksgiving Eve.

				I&#039;m hosting Thanksgiving for the whole family this year and doing it through Fresh Direct. You order the bird (comes with dinner rolls, gravy and cranberry sauce), your choice of side dishes and desserts, and you can even order bottles of wine to go with the meal. Reasonably priced, and comes with detailed instructions for heating everything up so it&#039;s all timed perfectly. They will deliver it all to your home on Tuesday or Wednesday before the big day and it really takes a lot of the stress out of the holiday.

				<strong>Ottomonelli</strong> &nbsp;is a prime butcher. They are on 61st and Woodside Avenue - 1 block south of Roosevelt. They are the same Ottomonellias in Manhattan. The turkeys are fresh and delicous. They also have sauage out of the casings - also with herbs already or with cranberry mixture. You must pre-order via phone and then pick-up the day before. <br /><br />

				I have purchased Turkeys from Ottomonelli for many years and they sell very good birds and meat!<br /><br />I was wondering if the local free range birds would be a step up?

				I have no idea how they would compare.<br />I know that anything and everything I buy at Ottomanelli&#039;s is excellent. ;D<br /><br />I have also bought a bone leg of lamb which they seasoned and tied for the oven or spit. Outstanding! :smitten:<br /><br />Enjoy!!!
