				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For those of you who don&#039;t know, my son loves subways.&nbsp; (Yes, the <br />trains, not the fast food!)&nbsp; Since he was young, he&#039;d pour over the maps of the <br />trains and buses ... it was a big thing when the Q19B became the Q49, and the V <br />was discontinued.&nbsp; It&#039;s beena goal of ours to ride as many trains as we can in <br />one day, and I promised him that we&#039;d do it soon. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, I joined QCPAC, a type of support group of parents of children <br />affected with autism.&nbsp; (Yes, for those of you who don&#039;t know, my son is autistic <br />... specifically, he has Asperger&#039;s syndrome.&nbsp; Without getting into the daily <br />grind or school battles he faced, let&#039;s just say that it&#039;s been a rough road, <br />but I am proud of the many accomplishments he has made and continues to make <br />daily.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I decided that perhaps we can combine his upcoming event with a <br />chance to do good for the QCPAC group, a charitable organization always in <br />need.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, he and I are proud to announce our event is now a Train-a-thon!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Monday, April 25th, he and I will take to the rails!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Similar to many walk-a-thons I did as a student, where people used to <br />pledge me per kilometer walked for the March of Dimes or similar groups, I have <br />talked to Lucas about dedicating our adventure to our new group.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, we are asking for sponsors to pledge tax deductable donations to <br />QCPAC ... as little as $1 per train line he rides can go a long way to helping <br />our friends at QCPAC continue to be the great resource they are.&nbsp; And it will <br />give our madcap dash through the subway system of New York City an even greater <br />purpose.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, if you are interested in sponsoring him, please reply to this by inboxing me.&nbsp; Thanks.

				<strong>I haven&#039;t been inside a train in 18 or so years&nbsp; :embarassed:...my 3 year old son has never been in one.&nbsp; Let me know when we can do this...I&#039;ll take nana and my kid on a ride.
