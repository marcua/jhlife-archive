				Hi there!<br /><br />We&#039;re currently searching in the historic district of JH. Is lead in water an issue in these older prewar buildings? Do people typically test for it after they&#039;ve moved in, during/after renovations or even before contract signing? Trying to get a sense of how serious the problem is and what the typical treatment is (e.g. replace pipes or add filters, etc).<br /><br />Thanks!<br />

				All of the plumbing in pre-war buildings is likely to be made of lead. There are some exceptions, of course, like if there was a substantial renovation in a particular unit or a big repair made in which some pipes were replaced. Even if you were to find an apartment without lead pipes it&#039;s very likely that the big pipe in the street that carries water to your apartment is lead. So the bottom line is there&#039;s lead in our drinking water. But the good news is that it&#039;s probably not at levels that are dangerous.<br /><br />If you are at all concerned, which is reasonable, the NYC DEP offers all residents a do-it-yourself lead testing kit. You take some samples and they will send you the results. I did this and discovered there are low levels of lead, nothing that is a health hazard. But they did recommend that I run the water in my kitchen 2-5 minutes before using it.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the link to get your free kit:<br />https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/lead-in-drinking-water-test-kit.page<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying a place you could put water testing in your contract.

				We had our water tested. It&#039;s safe.

				A test conducted by one concerned shareholder in our landmark district coop revealed lead levels at 3 parts per million when the cold water was first run, down to 2 parts per million after 2 minutes of running the cold water. CDC guidance suggests a health concern (especially for children) when lead levels are 15 parts per million or above. <br /><br />One can easily purchase and self-install a professional grade water filtration system underneath the kitchen sink at The Home Depot if ANY level of lead in the drinking water is unacceptable to them. Removing/replacing pipes would not be a practical solution, as the source of lead could very well be the water main and supply line leading into the building.

				Just making a correction to the stats in my earlier reply: I should have said parts per <strong>billion</strong>, not parts per million.

				Thanks for the feedback everyone! We&#039;ll keep the water filtration system in mind, that may be the likely route we go if/when we find a place.

				&nbsp; We sometimes have a reddish tint to the bath water in our apt. Does anyone know if this is connected to lead? I am going to order this test but it sounds like most of the concern is with drinking water.

				Anybody else concerned about the PVC pipes ? I get that it&#039;s better than lead but I definitely taste something....
