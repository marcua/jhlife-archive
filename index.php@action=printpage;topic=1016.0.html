				Greetings!<br /><br />I&#039;m very happy to announce that Chuckster has accepted the moderators invitation to become a global moderator of the forum. Chuckster will be assuming the new role for a term of 6 months. She joins the moderator team to replace Toddg, who is stepping down to assume the role of full time calendar editor. I know I speak on behalf of everyone when I say a huge thanks to Todd for all his work in getting this site off the ground and in welcoming Chuckster to the moderator team.<br /><br />As the site continues to grow, more moderator positions may become available, and it&#039;s our goal to assign new positions as they are needed on a 6-month rotating term.<br /><br />Our current moderators are:<br />Shelby2 - Moderator<br />Chuckster - Moderator<br />Toddg - Calendar Editor<br />merm - Site Admin<br /><br />Thank you all for your continued support of the site.

				Todd, your work on the calendar and posting links has been pretty amazing on a &quot;part time&quot; basis.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine you expanding it too much.&nbsp; Chuckster,&nbsp; I know you&#039;ll do a great job as a moderator and i hope you continue to participate at the same level in the threads as you do know.&nbsp; Your discussion adds so&nbsp; much to this board.

				I&#039;ve updated the main post so that we have a current list of everyone who is a moderator. I had forgot to mention that Shelby will be staying on as a moderator in her role. Many thanks to her as well for her instrumental role in launching the site originally! We&#039;ve got a great support team in place for the site!&nbsp; :rockon:
