				I hope this notice reaches many folks in the Jackson Heights community.&nbsp; Our community has this man in the images&nbsp; below going building to building for the sole purpose of stealing your packages.&nbsp; His MO: He always wears a jacket with the hoodie over his head, has a supermarket shopping cart and shopping bags to fill&nbsp; them with your packages.&nbsp; Worst of all he stands in front of buildings entryway waiting for a building resident to enter with their key so he can hold door for them and walks right in, lingers around the lobby until itâ€™s clear so he can fill his shopping cart and bags with all of your packages that you all have purchased with your hard earn money. Be aware of who you let into your building. If this has occurred in your building share your images, print &amp;&nbsp; post them for residents of your community to become aware. If you see this man call the police, have him arrested and file charges.

				This has been such a problem when so many sales are online now. We did three things to try and alleviate the problem: first, we installed cameras at all major entrances; we put a new door on the mail room; and best of all, our super set up a system where he goes into the mail room at the end of each day and sends out an email to everyone in the building Google group (not 100% participation, but those online a lot to order packages also tend to be in the group) with apartment numbers of that day&#039;s recipients. People know to hustle down there....So far, so good, as far as I can tell.&nbsp;

				I am not sure which system we use but can check with the super and update sometime soon. We also pasted pics from the cameras to the entry doors to show potential thieves what we would do with their images if captured.
