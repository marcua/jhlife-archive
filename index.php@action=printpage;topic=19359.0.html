				The problems on Roosevelt Avenue go back for decades and it hardly looks like the local politicians, city and federal agencies are likely to change it. Conspiracy theories no more.

				&nbsp;I think that there is an art project to be made here with lighting under the Roosevelt Ave trains.<br />Other cities have cleverly used the latest technology to put LED lights into a design of some sort<br />that makes the area come alive instead of one to be avoided. This is a big task but I think the city<br />could get behind an idea that unites and beautifies Roosevelt, especially at night.

				&nbsp;The BID had to do with the businesses contributing funds. This would be a non-profit <br />arts based thing that would improve safety and add something aesthetically. Has been<br />done successfully in Phila, Baltimore and San Francisco with urban structures.

				If my memory serves me correctly. wasn&#039;t there some artist who did a walk through with lighting&nbsp; recommendations?&nbsp; Not too sure what become of this. Dromm has been completely passive on this front, as he is with many quality of life issues in the neighborhood. In terms of a BID, I see that most of the merchants&nbsp; on Roosevelt could care less. Otherwise,&nbsp; they would actively be taking care of their own properties or form some coalition.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Roosevelt ave has been known all over queens for being the place to find prostitutes, &quot; massages&quot; since the 90s and nothing has changed...these women are in short skirts and heels on corners at 12- 1am saying massage massage....why are these places still not shut down?? They are overly aggressive with men that walk down the block and make roosevelt ave look worse than it already is...why is this not changing?

				Perhaps this very thread on Jackson Heights Life can be sent to the 115th Police Department and our political representatives for their input?<br /><br />And they can add their comments and ideas and solutions concerning the situation?<br /><br />The same applies for the drug dealing thread. <br /><br />https://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=19130.0<br /><br />That thread had been read way over 6600 times. So by approx, say, 6000 people. <br /><br />I am certain we all look forward to our leaders and our police force&nbsp; addressing and helping with our issues.

				The politicians and the 115 know exactly whats going on. It’s been happening for over 35 years. I’ve lived my whole life here and have seen the same pattern. All talk with no action accompanied by complacency.....u til the next out cry from local residents. Time to elect local leaders who are effective and “result” driven. As for the 115, its time to investigate the investigators.

				I just noticed that Roosevelt is covered by two precincts.<br /><br />The 115th covers the side that covers Jackson Heights.&nbsp; The 110th covers the other side. <br /><br />I wonder if this is part of the problem?

				You would think that their would be joint coordination between the two.&nbsp; Besides the police, there really needs to be a multi agency enforcement which needs to be consistent.&nbsp; Illegal social security cards, sex trafficking, prostitution&nbsp; and drugs all in plain site. You don&#039;t have to be Inspector Clouseau to figure it out.

				For the last few weeks I have been forwarding Roosevelt Avenue-related threads from this site to our elected officials (Dromm, Moya, Cruz and Ramos) and the NCOs at the 115th precinct.&nbsp; Yesterday, in an email, the NCOs reiterated that any and all complaints be made to 311 when you see something.&nbsp; Prostitution-related complaints will likely be transferred to 911.&nbsp; The sole elected official I have heard back from was Councilmember Dromm.<br /><br />So just like the subway, if you see something, say something.&nbsp; Without a record of complaints to 311/911 little if any progress will be made.&nbsp; The precincts will be held accountable for documented complaints via 311.&nbsp; I realize that this can be frustrating and time consuming, but in the long run it will be worth it.&nbsp; So call.

				Apparently in the 1980&#039;s, THE GUARDIAN ANGELS countered crime in the subways.<br /><br />Obviously the police and authorities were impotent in those days.<br /><br />Hey, I discovered they still exist! Maybe we can convince them to help?<br /><br />http://guardianangels.org/<br />
