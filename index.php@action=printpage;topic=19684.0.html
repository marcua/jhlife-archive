				Hi there,<br />I&#039;ve been an NYC resident for a little less than a year now though I my family lived here when they first moved to America, so I have some familiarity with the Queens area and Jackson Heights since we used to go there all the time for shopping for South Asian groceries. However, I&#039;ve been living on my own now as a professional in my twenties and decided to first move to Astoria since I&#039;ve heard many people my age choosing to live there. I see the appeal of Astoria, but I&#039;ve been considering different neighborhoods since Astoria feels expensive, the quality of apartments don&#039;t feel that great, the fewer transportation options and the whole hipster feeling not really being my thing lol. I&#039;ve seen some apartments in Jackson Heights along the 82nd street stop. I&#039;m wondering if anybody lives around that area and how they like it in terms of walkability, transportation, etc. I don&#039;t have a car, so I want to be able to be in an area convenient to grocery stores, fine to walk around and easy to commute. Would love to hear thoughts!

				Welcome!&nbsp; I live around 77th Street.&nbsp; I find JH is a very convenient place to live without a car.&nbsp; The neighborhood itself is very pleasant and walkable.&nbsp; And there are multiple subway lines to Manhattan, which is especially convenient on evenings and weekends, when any individual route may be disrupted due to maintenance work.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />P.S. While you&#039;re still checking out the neighborhood, be sure to check out our outstanding Greenmarket (https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/queens/jackson-heights) on a Sunday morning!

				Hi there, you cannot really compare Astoria to Jackson Heights. I lived in Astoria about 30 years ago, than moved to Jackson Heights and never looked back. The housing stock is better here, larger apartments, and while your looking, check out some with private gardens. I think 34th Ave. and 35th&nbsp; Ave. are lovely blocks to be walking along in the spring and summer. Jackson Heights shopping is also better, and much more convenient, not to mention the diversity and lower prices for food than Astoria. Subways are definitely better, with a good bus system as well. For now at least. Of course every neighborhood has its downside. 82nd St. tends&nbsp; to be noisy with the buses and ambulances. But, if you get an apartment in the back facing a private garden it probably will not affect you. It may be less expensive if you walked a few blocks away from 82nd St. It will also be greener, and quieter. But I much prefer Jackson Heights to Astoria.

				&nbsp;As much as Jackson Heights can be a terrific place to live, I would first ask the question are you in a relationship or looking to be? Nightlife here for younger people is not that vibrant (there are pockets) and the people steering you towards Astoria are probably thinking of that aspect of life. Of course you can live in this neighborhood and find nightlife elsewhere but it&#039;s not that much a twenties scene here and I would suggest car services home at night if you are out very late while living in JH.

				We moved to JH four years ago. I am married and middle-aged, but if I were younger and single I would not move to JH. The Pros of the neighborhood are beautiful and (relatively) affordable apartments, good transit access, it&#039;s safe, and we enjoy the diversity in ethnicities and cultures. The Cons are there are few casual &quot;American&quot; restaurants or bars, it&#039;s not all that fast to get to Manhattan, and Roosevelt Avenue is pretty sketchy at night. <br /><br />If you do choose to move here, live as close as possible to the 74th St/Roosevelt Avenue transit hub. We live near 82nd / 7 train line and it adds 10-20 min to our daily commute. <br />

				Definitely make sure that the 74th/Roosevelt Ave Express Hub is your subway stop.<br /><br />That way you can zoom to Brooklyn/Astoria and Manhattan. <br /><br />Express E to the G for Brooklyn<br />R/M to Astoria<br />Express E/F to Manhattan<br /><br />And when there&#039;s an issue with any of those subway lines...getting to the 7 will always get you back...above any underground mess!<br />

				I lived in Astoria for 17 years before moving to Jackson Heights 10 years ago.&nbsp; The historic district of Jackson Heights is far more beautiful than Astoria, particularly in the spring, summer and fall months and it seems to me the housing stock here is nicer.&nbsp; The contrary is true outside of the historic district.&nbsp; I believe there is far more home ownership in JH compared to more of a renter&#039;s market in Astoria.&nbsp; Though JH is a little further out, we&#039;ve got express trains which makes travel to Manhattan about the same.&nbsp; Plus, there are more subway lines to choose from should one be out due to maintenance.&nbsp; Plenty of grocery stores within walking distance in JH although it is my opionion they all could use an upgrade.&nbsp; Still, Frosted Flakes is Frosted Flakes wherever you buy it.&nbsp; The Greenmarket on Sundays is definitely an added bonus here in JH.&nbsp; On the downside, JH definitely does not have the hip and lively restaurant scene Astoria has.&nbsp; 30th Avenue in Astoria is lively well into the night whereas JH seems to close up shop relatively early.&nbsp; JH is definitely very walkable.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ve pretty much reiterated what others have said.&nbsp; Hope we&#039;re being helpful.&nbsp; (This website is also a great resource for those living in JH.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe Astoria has anything like it.&nbsp; Not that I know of anyway.)

				I personally would not make sure that the 74th St. is my subway station. I would prefer to be above 82nd street. Just seems quieter. I donâ€™t mind to have the options of the Q49, the #7, or even walking the 8 blocks or so as a way to connect to the Express. I guess it depends on where your final destination in Manhattan will be. But the #7 train, if you get on at 82nd or 90th and have a seat, is quite a pleasant ride in the morning.<br />

				The question is from someone in his/her 20&#039;s. Not a senior. He/she will need to go to Brooklyn/Manhattan/Astoria pretty often. That&#039;s only really do-able conveniently when you&#039;re near that express stop. <br /><br />But actually, what&#039;s great about the JH express stop&nbsp; is that all those three locations are very reachable from it. <br /><br />And for instance everyone knows that to get from Brooklyn to Astoria is nigh on impossible.

				I came to JH from Astoria 16 years ago and still miss Astoria and I&#039;m not single.&nbsp; &nbsp;I miss the food shops, bakeries, the gyms and yoga, the neighborhood vibe, the bars, the stores, the beautiful parks.&nbsp; I moved because I wanted to buy not rent and JH is affordable.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the commute is any worse and I love JH restaurants.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need a car.&nbsp; Maybe I wouldn&#039;t like Astoria as much now with the hipster vibe although I don&#039;t notice it much when I visit.&nbsp; It feels safer in Astoria at night because there are people around on the street.&nbsp;

				The beautiful parks?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; Astoria Park is nice, but it&#039;s actually pretty far from the Steinway/30th Avenue location I generally think of as Astoria.&nbsp; I guess the Astoria boundaries must extend further to the water, but that certainly is not the hipster area.&nbsp; Nor is it walkable to grocery stores.....or anything for that matter.&nbsp;

Plus there&#039;s a beautiful East River bank promenade in the North direction. For us, Ditmars/Astoria Park is the 7 to the N/W @ Queensboro...do-able.&nbsp; &nbsp; (The R, M Astoria Steinway stop is easier from here, of course. And that&#039;s kinda near Socrates Sculpture Park. Which is also amazing in summer.)

				That&#039;s right, Ditmars area is hip and closer to Astoria Park.&nbsp; Is the renovation complete?&nbsp; I ride my bike over that way in the summertime and the &quot;track section&quot; that was being renovated was still not open.&nbsp; Do not recall any other work going on there.&nbsp; The pool always looks nice, but the diving area that was supposed to be turned into a music venue never seemed to have happened.&nbsp; As far as Socrates Park is concerned, I believe I may be in the miniority, but it looks like a big waste of space to me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t find it attractive at all and the installations are rarely appealing.&nbsp;

				As a relative newcomer to JH, one thing that surprised me is how congested and dirty the streets are. This is something you just don&#039;t see in Astoria. Also for a younger person, in their 20s, Astoria is ideal. Lots of interesting bars and restaurants. JH just doesn&#039;t have the same variety and Roosevelt Ave. is a pit. I would not move to JH until you settle down -- and even then ask yourself whether you want to live amid trash on the streets and cars honking day and night.

				We are definitely having winter.&nbsp; The sun reached it&#039;s lowest point in the sky in late December... therefore... Winter.&nbsp; Are you suggesting it&#039;s not cold enough?&nbsp; Some winters are cold and some are less cold... I&#039;ll enjoy the less cold ones while I can, knowing that a coooold winter is probably just a year away.

				Thank you for all these great replies! I guess I will have to do some exploring as I&#039;m apartment hunting these days and am thankfully not pressed for time to search. <br /><br />I am single but I am not a nightlife or bars person because I don&#039;t drink lol. My social life usually involves going to see friends once every other week or so. My daily commute is to Queens/Queensboro Plaza, so the trains in JH seem to provide similar convenience as does Astoria. I also go to Manhattan every now in then. I hardly have any reason to go to Brooklyn to be honest. <br /><br />I guess my ideal apartment is something that feels homely and with space, a relatively affordable budget and something convenient to subways and grocery stores and somewhere where it would be comfortable to walk at as late as 12AM or early as 5AM. The one plus side I&#039;m aware of with JH is that I&#039;m South Asian and all the South Asian groceries are there. We have Trade Fair in Astoria that works ok for most of the time but I tend to make occasional trips to JH for groceries. <br /><br />I do like that Astoria has people walking around at all hours and a mixed age groups and relatively safe-I am not sure if JH differs in terms of people being out and about even past 10PM? I realize JH might have more families or not as much of a young demographic as Astoria. It&#039;s also nice Astoria has a little bit of everything and is somewhat diverse, though since I have had family live in areas closer to Hillside avenue, Jamaica and Flushing, it does feel comparatively less diverse. <br /><br />Beyond the grocery stores, I don&#039;t have much familiarity with JH. I walked around once recently down Roosevelt and loved the hustle and bustle, but don&#039;t quite know what it&#039;s like to be a young person staying there so I appreciate these responses! I guess I am going to really have to spend some time looking around.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I find Roosevelt Avenue extremely unpleasant with all the strip bars or whatever they are. It&#039;s very grungy and even a bit scary. I get away from it as fast as I can. I will endorse the idea of living close to the 74th St. Station. We do, and it&#039;s not any noisier than up around 82nd St. Definitely not. We live between 37th and 35th and our street is mostly very quiet, even though we are as close to that station as possible within the historic district.&nbsp; We are not near the 7 train, we don&#039;t hear it where we are--there is really no reason to think the 80s are quieter than the 70s in JH. We looked in both areas and far preferred the 70s.

				Woodside and Sunnyside are also solid options, with an easy commute to LIC. <br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in Jackson Heights, Woodside, Sunnyside, and Astoria, and those neighborhoods are solid choices for commuting in to midtown with lots of groceries, restaurants, bars, and other shopping nearby. It depends where you are in each neighborhood of course, but if you&#039;re looking at apartments within 1/2 mile to a train station (about a 10 minute walk), chances are you&#039;ll have no problems with amenities.

				One of the main reasons I prefer to live in the mid-80s is because you have the option of walking to 74th St. Itâ€™s really a nice walk and you get to see the beauty of the neighborhood. Iâ€™m pretty sure that if you live around 74th St. youâ€™re not taking a walk up into the 80s, so youâ€™re missing a lot of the neighborhood I think

				@sabnyc90: You don&#039;t mention whether you are looking to buy or rent in Jackson Heights. If you&#039;re only interested in a rental unit, and not looking to make an investment, I&#039;d say stick to Astoria for now. But if you&#039;re looking to purchase a coop or condo unit, and considering staying in place for 5 or more years, then Jackson Heights is probably your better option. <br /><br />As for the 74th Street vs. 82nd Street debate, I will only say this: ALL of Jackson Heights is very walkable and convenient to shopping, restaurants, etc. In general, the further away you get from Roosevelt/74th Street, the cleaner and quieter the streets become, which is the trade-off for being a little further from the transit hub.<br /><br />I hope that helps you decide.

				Hmmm...well I live near 74 St station, but in fact I do walk up into the 80s for a number of reasons. To visit people who live there, to patronize stores and restaurants located there. It&#039;s hardly true that I am cut off from that part of the neighborhood because I live in the mid-70s. <br /><br />It&#039;s a great advantage to be closer to the 5 train lines at the 74th St. transit hub vs just being close to the train at 82nd St. I don&#039;t see how you can argue that point. And the idea that being in the 70s is noisier and the streets are less clean--well, it&#039;s just not true, and you can walk the blocks to see for yourself. It&#039;s dirty and noisy on Roosevelt, all along Roosevelt, but north of 37th, the streets are quiet and pretty in the 70s. <br /><br />We love where we are, because it&#039;s a six-seven minute walk to that station, while also being within a block or three of everything we need: two large supermarkets, several fruit/veg stores, the post office, several dry cleaners, a cobbler, a 24-hour Duane Reade and many other pharmacies, a few late-night bodegas, a mailing and package store, E77, Table Wine, Farine&#039;s. <br /><br />Speaking of which, I have to laugh at the poster here who predicted doom for Farine&#039;s because, the poster said, it was in the wrong location for the type of business it is. It seems to be doing extremely well with all neighborhood constituencies: I walk by it often on my way to the station, and it is always busy, sometimes jammed with customers. The food (not to mention the sweets) is excellent, and people seem to be responding to that.<br /><br />When we were looking to move to JH, we also weighed the 80s vs the 70s and came down solidly on the side of the 70s even though we did see some nice buildings and apartments in the 80s.

				Hi there!<br /><br />I also recently lived in Astoria and moved down to JH. The reason is to purchase, not to rent!<br />Things I like quite a lot are the local farmers market, how beautiful 34/35th ave is in the spring/summer/fall, the amazing access to Hispanic and Asian food, the neighborly feel. The prices here are definitely more reasonable and you can eat out for a decent price. You will want to live closer within walking distance to a train station. I live around 82nd street which is great, though it builds a little extra time onto the commute.<br /><br />One big bonus for me is that if you are into Asian food, is that you can walk to elmhurst (15-20 minutes) and also itâ€™ll only take around 15 minutes to get to Flushing which has so many things! It was a slog to get there from Astoria.<br /><br /><br />The cons are: youâ€™ll want an apartment on a side street or facing away from the street as it can be noisy, Roosevelt Avenue can be meh, there are no good Irish bars/American food spots here. if you live further away from the train, youâ€™ll need to take a bus which can get congested. The gym situation is dire.

				I think the ideal spot would be around Hawthorne Court (76th/77th Street) or Hampton Court Garden (78th/79th Street). I&#039;m not sure what those co-ops are like to live in (other than that they have nice gardens), but location wise, you would have a close walk to the 74th Street station (which you really do want to be able to walk to) and would still be close to a lot of other nice things in the neighborhood.<br /><br />You probably don&#039;t want to be too close to the 74th Street station, but there are a lot of great restaurants and supermarkets around there, and if you are really close then you could also walk to Woodside quite easily which has more great food and which also has the Long Island Rail Road station.

				With the possibility that the Q49 could be eliminated, I would recommend the area from 79th St to 75th St between 35th Ave &amp; 37th Ave.&nbsp; If you could find a place facing the rear/garden this would be a plus.&nbsp;

				I think the stock for singles has gotten considerably better in the last few years as many people have been priced out of other &quot;cooler&quot; neighborhoods.

				Look, think of Jax Heights as a millions times more convenient and interesting and urban place than living in Long Island or New Jersey.<br /><br />The prices here for rent/buying are less than the very hip Brooklyn/Manhattan/Astoria places.&nbsp; (They used to be MUCH, MUCH cheaper). But you definitely get more bang for your buck with apartments.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be mostly traveling by subway to see your pals/go out.&nbsp; Your pals will come here once or twice a year maybe for momos.<br /><br />And if you&#039;re nearer the 74th st hub...the traveling by express subway is either a half or a podcast away for where you always need to go.<br /><br />So it&#039;s a cinch, really.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />

				If you are not drawn by the bar/cafe/restaurant scene in Astoria and like to do your South Asian grocery shopping in Jackson Heights, you might very well enjoy JH more. There are lots of cafes and bakeries here of various ethnic persuasions if you care to sit in one or grab something to go. Roosevelt Avenue is dirty, yes, and that&#039;s not good, but I do like having people out and about late at night. It feels safer. I can come home at midnight and itâ€™s like rush hour (well, not quite, but full of people). Itâ€™s great to be at an express subway stop with multiple lines, too.

				Captain Flannel: I was just responding to the suggestion that a reason to live in the 80s is you can then walk through and get to see a chunk of the neighborhood to get to the 74th St station. But of course you can always walk the other way--so I don&#039;t think that holds up as a reason for choosing to live in the 80s. Another reason to choose to be closer to the 74th St station is accessibility--that station has elevators, escalators, and stairs leading down to four of the five subway lines. Whereas the 82nd St station on the 7 line has stairs leading up and is an outside station--harder for people with any sort of health or mobility issues.

People who aren&#039;t you can have different reasons for living 10 blocks from where you choose to live, well, because they aren&#039;t you and are allowed to have different priorities from your own. <br /><br />I know when I started looking in the neighborhood to buy, I ended up deciding on a place in the 80s, even though I had initially wanted to be closer to the 74th Street station. Some people like to walk -- it&#039;s good for your long-term health -- and the reality is between the local 7 or the express E &amp; F lines, you gain and lose something on each commute. You&#039;re more likely to get a seat on the 7 at 82nd St at the expense of a longer commute. On the E &amp; F,&nbsp; you&#039;ll get to midtown faster, but are unlikely to get a seat. When I was younger and I rolled out of bed with the bare minimum necessary to get to work on time, I was more likely to take the E &amp; F (and walked from 80th Street to do so). Now that I seem to be adopting the sleep habits of my grandmother -- up before the sun more often than not-- I&#039;ll just take the 7 to get a seat and allow myself more commuting time. When I want to get a little more walking in for the day, I get off at 74th St. and walk up to the 80s.<br /><br />Different strokes for different folks.

				Captain Flannel--As it happens, I get a seat on the 7 every day at 74th Street. A lot of people get off the 7 to transfer to other trains there, so it usually empties out. You can have a zillion reasons why you prefer to live in the 80s, but asserting that the 7 line at 82nd St is just as convenient and possibly superior to having 5 subway lines, including the 7, at 74th St...well, that just doesn&#039;t make sense. Sure you can walk to 74th --who is disputing that? But in bad weather or bad health, it&#039;s just not as advantageous as being closer to more subway lines (and busses, at least for now....)

				Captain Flannel--relax, you&#039;ll have a cardiac event. Of course people have different tastes and priorities, live wherever you like for whatever reason--but it&#039;s just a fact that a transit hub with 5 subway lines is an advantage over the 82nd St station with just the 7.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of the pluses of the 70s. This is a fact--nothing to do with my &quot;perceived superiority.&quot; I just thought the idea that living farther away from the transit hub because then you can have the pleasure and extra exercise of walking more blocks to get there seemed kind of far-fetched as a reason to live in the 80s.

There are other factors that people other than yourself may consider and put different weight on that you do: foot traffic near transit hubs; traffic congestion and noise associated with a bus depot; real estate costs; and also how much walking they like to do on a daily basis.

				Since there&#039;ve been many posts, here are my impressions:<br /><br />I live on 82nd Street between 35th and 37th Avenues.&nbsp; Our place is in the back, so we literally hear no noise whatsoever, despite being on a bus route.&nbsp; 37th Avenue, and 82nd Street, as well as the area around 74th, tends to get messy during the day, but go beyond those blocks and it&#039;s clean.&nbsp; I actually prefer living on 82nd because in the morning, I stand on the subway for one stop, and then many people exit at 74th, so I almost always get a seat.&nbsp; Been here over 15 years, and I can count on one hand the times that I didn&#039;t get a seat.&nbsp; <br /><br />We moved here when we were in out 30&#039;s.&nbsp; We&#039;re a gay couple, but not much into nightlife, so this suited us.&nbsp; When we were in our 20&#039;s we lived in the East Village.&nbsp; If you go out at night, and still want to stay in Queens, try Sunnyside as the nightlife is better there.<br /><br />As for safety, as a guy, I&#039;ve never been scared.&nbsp; Having said that, I also never go on Roosevelt after, say, 11 p.m.&nbsp; And the residential streets can get spookily quiet at night, so if I was a woman, and someone was following me on them, I&#039;d have my guard up.&nbsp; When I find myself in that situation, I just sing along to the music on my headphones just to make myself known so the woman won&#039;t think I&#039;m sneaking up on them.&nbsp; Most of the times, I get a chuckle as I pass, but better than scaring the crap out of someone.
