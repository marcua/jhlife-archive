Why are they undocumented?, because they crossed the border illegally or overstayed their visa. This is a far cry from throwing a piece of paper on the ground. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why is it a far cry from committing a crime like running a red light? If you run a red light or a stop sign, which most people probably have, you could hit someone who&#039;s crossing the intersection. I see you went well out of your way to include the parenthetical notation &quot;illegals&quot; in your comment. You should know that the process for most undocumented people to become residents is now nearly impossible thanks to the ridiculous immigration laws being put in place by the racist president who also loves the term &quot;illegals.&quot; Go drive into the ocean.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />You break a law and get caught, you pay the penalty.&nbsp; Pass a red light, you get a ticket.&nbsp; Litter, you get a ticket.&nbsp; Hit someone in an intersection and it&#039;s due to negligence get ready to pay out lawsuits and potentially lose your license and/or go to jail.&nbsp; In the country illegally, you get deported.&nbsp; It&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />Illegal aliens can&nbsp; become residents as easily as anyone else wishing to immigrate to the United States.&nbsp; They need to go back to their own countries, start the application process, provide the required information and complete the requirements to get a visa.&nbsp; That includes inoculations and medical screening that are intended to protect current residents.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jumping the line ahead of those who are trying to come here legitimately should never be rewarded.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh, really? You live in JH, right? Every day of my life here I see people littering all over the street, triple-parking, running red lights, almost hitting people (including me, many times) as they drive. None of those people get penalized. Have you ever seen someone in this neighborhood get a ticket for littering? How many times have you almost been hit by a negligent driver?<br /><br />Coming to this country illegally isn&#039;t putting other people in harm&#039;s way like running a red light is. And you clearly know no one from a Latin American country who has tried to become a resident, because it&#039;s nearly impossible. The current administration has caused people to live in fear of ever getting a visa or gaining legal status. For people from certain countries, there is no &quot;jumping the line,&quot; because they&#039;re not being allowed in in the first place. Think of how many people apply to the visa lottery.<br /><br />This country was founded by immigrants, and surely your ancestors are among them. Ever look at an old census from the times when immigration to the US was booming in the 20th century? You can see clearly how many white immigrants came here illegally—look at an old NYC census and you&#039;d be surprised at how many people have &quot;Alien&quot; written next to their name. Many of those people never naturalized, even though it was WAY easier to do it back then. If it was that easy now, we&#039;d surely have close to no undocumented people.<br /><br />Maybe you should consider having empathy for those whose struggles are different than yours. If you live here, you know many of your neighbors—people who make your food, pour your drinks, sell you what you need—are undocumented. Are they bad people simply because they wanted a better life? If you actually took the time to talk to them, you&#039;d know that many put their own lives at risk to come here. No one WANTS to live a life of hiding and fear. If it was easy to become a resident, everyone would do it.

You&#039;re very pointedly calling them &quot;illegals,&quot; not even &quot;illegal aliens&quot; as you just mentioned. Calling them &quot;illegals&quot; minimizes their entire identity to the fact that they came here illegally. If you ran a stoplight and hit someone, people wouldn&#039;t be calling you an &quot;illegal driver&quot; or shortening that to &quot;an illegal&quot; simply because you drove through a light and hit someone. And hitting someone with your car is way more harmful than entering a country illegally to escape poverty, gangs, and crime. When you refer to someone as &quot;an illegal,&quot; you&#039;re being willfully obtuse. &quot;Illegal alien&quot; sounds harsh but yes, it&#039;s factual. It means someone is here illegally. But referring to someone simply as &quot;an illegal&quot; is where you&#039;re in the wrong.

I see you went well out of your way to include the parenthetical notation &quot;illegals&quot; in your comment. You should know that the process for most undocumented people to become residents is now nearly impossible thanks to the ridiculous immigration laws being put in place by the racist president who also loves the term &quot;illegals.&quot; Go drive into the ocean.

					Yesterday night at 3 am and just now at 2 am, I&#039;ve heard two loud booming noises, a few minutes apart on each night. Last night, it woke me up, terrified that something bad was happening.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if the noise is fireworks or something else, but whatever it is, it&#039;s THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT and no one wants to be jolted awake or to feel like something just exploded near their window.<br /><br />As I&#039;m writing this, I just heard another of the noises.

If they&#039;re &quot;illegal&quot; for coming to this country undocumented (many seeking asylum from situations that your stupid, ignorant self could never survive), then by that logic, anyone breaking a law in this country should be called an &quot;illegal.&quot; Have you ever littered? Ran a red light? Pocketed untaxed income off the books? I&#039;m sure you have. In that case, you&#039;re an illegal. God, I never realized there were so many stupid people in this neighborhood that I thought was inclusive and diverse. You trolls probably don&#039;t even live here anymore.

					I was forced to go to the gym out of the neighborhood for this reason, which is really inconvenient for most of us. Right now I go in Manhattan since it&#039;s close to my job, but before that I used to go to Retro Fitness. I believe it&#039;s considered Astoria, but it&#039;s right near Northern Boulevard.<br /><br />Retro was $20 a month, never overcrowded, and open very late (I think it might&#039;ve been 24 hours?). The machines worked and were in great shape, they had a variety of machines and equipment, and people at the gym were careful and respectful. The staff seemed knowledgeable. They also gave some free classes, had a smoothie bar, and had a really cool movie theater where you could work out while watching movies. I would definitely go back there if the commute from Retro to my place wasn&#039;t annoying.

Many of my friends who also went to CUNY schools and worked their way through college and early adulthood would really resent you saying that &quot;this generation&quot; thinks poverty is not having an iPhone... we paid our dues just like you did when &quot;America was great&quot; apparently.

					That&#039;s horrible, I&#039;m sorry your spouse had to go through that.<br /><br />I had a bad experience at that City MD too—I went there for a yeast infection (which I&#039;d been there for in the past) and had a male doctor (don&#039;t remember his name, I think he was a PA actually) who asked me a million times if I was pregnant. I reassured him that it was impossible for me to be pregnant at the time and he still kept asking, then made so many confusing and condescending comments regarding my treatment that the nurse/assistant apologized on his behalf after he left the room. He was asking me which medicine I take for a very common condition and then sitting at his computer Googling it, asking me to spell it for him and still spelling it wrong even after I told him like three times. He told me not to take two medicines together that the nurse later clarified were completely fine to be taken together. Won&#039;t be back there again.
