					Happy Holidays for Jackson Heights Greenmarket! As our gift to you, we bring you David Rowley, of Monkshood Nursery, located in Styvesant, NY.&nbsp; He is a certified organic grower who grows luscious greenhouse greens to help us through the lean months of winter. This weekend he is bringing his first cuttings from the greenhouses of baby greens and a small selection of root veggies and winter squashes. David will be at the market in person this week and is a great resource of information about vegetable farming and Organic practices. Come out and give him a warm JH welcome and help entice him to stick it out with us through the winter. <br /><br />And a quick reminder, the market, located on the corner of 34th Ave and 78th Street every Sunday, is going year round. Come out this weekend and stock up on local treats, sweets, veggies, and meats for all of your holiday entertaining. <strong>The market will be closed Sunday December 26 and January 2</strong> so the farmers can spend the holidays with their families but <span class="bbc_u"><strong>we will be reopen with snow boots and bells on Sunday January 9th</strong></span> and every Sunday thereafter no matter what the weather. Come snow, sleet, or cold, we will all be out there to provide you with the freshest, tastiest local produce anywhere around. Brave the cold and come out this winter to support our first year-round market in Queens! <br /><br />Jackson Heights Greenmarket<br /><a href="http://www.grownyc.org/jacksonheightsgreenmarket" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.grownyc.org/jacksonheightsgreenmarket</a><br />Sundays, 34th Ave and 78th Street<br />Closed December 26 and January 2, Reopen January 9 <br /><br />

They will be bringing fresh cut and dried lavender as well as sachets, eye pillows, and other delightful gifts. <br /><br />If you havenâ€™t been by the market in a bit, come check it out. You wonâ€™t believe your eyes! We have cheese from Cherry Grove, wine this week from Anthony Road vineyard, who was so well received as a special guest that they are coming back permanently, and it is the height of harvest season. We have produce running the gamut from late season tomatoes to the biggest and scariest in Halloween carving pumpkins. And of course for your protein needs, grass fed beef, eggs, chicken, pork and turkey. <br /><br />FYI Jackson Heights Greenmarket will be open until December 19th this year so keep checking JH Life for the latest fall events coming soon to the market!<br />&nbsp;<br />Jackson Heights Greenmarket is located on 34 Avenue between 77 &amp; 78 Streets, and on 78 St between 34 Avenue and Northern Blvd. Sundays through December 19, 8am-3pm.
