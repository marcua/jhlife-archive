				Does anyone know or have any experience with soundproofing their ceilings? I know of three companies in the NYC area that do this:<br /><br />https://www.brooklyninsulation.com/contact<br />http://www.citysoundproofing.com/<br />http://www.quietny.com/<br /><br />I have gotten general ranges of per square foot costs for these companies, but wondering if there are any others or general contractors anyone has used. We are looking to reduce impact (foot falls) and airborne noise so not just insulation. Basically the noise isolation channels, paired with layers of drywall with green glue.<br /><br />Also, if anyone simply redid their plaster ceilings with drywall and would recommend their contractor that would be very helpful as well.

				I was previously looking into sound-proofing last year due to loud neighbors, but ended up buying a bedside white-noise machine.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6D6LQY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E6D6LQY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)<br />Love it.&nbsp; It really did the trick.<br />I still use it, even tho the noisy neighbors have moved, to block out street noise.<br />MUCH cheaper than investing in sound-proof drywall.

				Hi jhresident82,<br /><br />I&#039;ll be speaking not as a realtor on this one, but rather someone who has worked with sound and sounds studios. <br />The only thing that stops sound is mass or distance. Since you can&#039;t get any farther from your neighbors :) the solution has to be mass.<br /><br />Let me elaborate. You won&#039;t be able to sound-proof fully unless you can create an air-tight seal around your entire apartment. Your goal is to do sound reduction, basically minimizing the amount of sound you get in. Insulation unfortunately does not stop sound, it may muffle it a tiny bit, but as a whole you need a layer with mass. You already mentioned sheet rock and green glue. Yes it&#039;s one of the methods often used, it&#039;s not a bad one, but you need to pick the thickness of the sheet rock correctly or it may have the opposite effect and amplify the sound like a resonator instead of muting it. Challenge is to stop the low frequency waves from coming through and they are the longest ones, therefore more mass the better. Often even the angle of installation of the extra layer of sheetrock may be different. Key is to break down the wave then block it.<br /><br />One thing to consider is what many studios, hotels and corporate buildings use for sound reduction, the product is Quiet Rock <br />https://www.quietrock.com/ (https://www.quietrock.com/)<br /><br />I am sure most companies or contractors familiar with soundproofing will be familiar with it. Hope this is helpful<br /><br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen
