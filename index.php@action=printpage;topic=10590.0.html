				I had to start a new topic on this because the closer the place gets to opening, the less likely it seems that the windows will be anything more than the backs of refrigeration units. I walked by this evening and in the corner now is a unit that is opposite a shelving unit.&nbsp; It looks like the only way to reach the windows in the corner, or on the 84th Street side is over the top of the refrigeration units.&nbsp; I doubt they will even be able to get the brown paper and the work permits off.&nbsp; Is the best we can hope for here a decal like we have with RiteAid?????&nbsp; It also looks like the units are blocking one of the doors.&nbsp; This must be a fire hazard - it certainly seems like it<br /><br />Please someone tell me I am wrong.&nbsp; If these window treatments remain, it will be a huge insult to the community and I for one will never shop there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anybody?<br /><br /><br />

				The answer to this question is yes. If your going to do it, you might as well do it right. Why would someone spend SO much money and not do something so simple as to benefit not only the business but the neighborhood as well. It just makes common business sense to do this. As far as a &quot;huge financial investment&quot;......well if the business is to succeed, they you should do something that pleases people in the neighborhood. I&#039;m looking forward to its&#039; opening and seeing what they will carry. It would be so much more pleasant if the windows were attractive and inviting.

				Geez, why don&#039;t you just speak to the owner if you are offended?<br /><br />I know him and he is very committed to the neighborhood. He has improved his business over the years, from a tiny store in a former pizzaria to this huge and dauting space he is now taking on.<br /><br />I have found him to be extremely accomodating. If you ask him to order something special he is happy to get it for you. He tries very hard to satisfy his customers. <br /><br />Really why don&#039;t you try to open a huge food business with permits&nbsp; and licenses and contractors and landlords and a huge lease&nbsp; and customers and everything else?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that you would find it a breeze and you would get it right before you even open your doors. Everyone would be thrilled by everything right off the bat and no one would have any suggestions ever.<br /><br />

				When it comes to a market, probably the least of my concerns is the storefront design. If they offer quality product at a good price, I will shop there. I could not care less if there&#039;s a bunch of refrigeration units in window displays. <br /><br />If it&#039;s really that big a deal, there are so many grocery options in JH that you can just choose another to patronize.

				I complain about a lot of things in JH, and while it&#039;s not 100 percent perfect, the JH Health Store is the &quot;little engine that could&quot;. The store is not cheap, they run out of things etc. but I am so happy to just be able to have one healthy food store.<br /><br />And seriously from day one when I move to JH in 2006, the people in this store are sweet, polite and helpful and yes, when I&#039;ve made suggestions: if they could do it (or get it for me) they happily did so. I understand that not everyone feels this way, but I personally feel like this store is an excellent local merchant.<br /><br />

				I have to agree&nbsp; with I live here too. The&nbsp; owner is&nbsp; a really nice guy and extremely receptive. I have not been down that way in a while&nbsp; and haven&#039;t seen the&nbsp; &nbsp;windows but couldn&#039;t imagine him purposely doing something negative. I&#039;ve been shopping at his store for many years-since the small original which I think is where the eyeglass place now is. The only problem I&#039;ve ever had is when the staff followed me around but after saying something they never bothered me again. I look forward to checking out the new space and encourage everyone else to do so.

				Unobstructed windows would of course be ideal. But notice that the health food store&#039;s current space does not exactly provide this either. The windows are blocked by shelving units. What they have done though is decorate the space with simple and pleasant window displays. To those disappointed by the newer space&#039;s layout, would a compromise of this sort serve as a sufficient solution? If so, it might be worth suggesting to the owner. (For all we know, he may already have this in mind.) To be honest, until I saw this thread, I had never even noticed that the current store&#039;s windows were obstructed. The displays offset this quite naturally. I see what people are saying about wanting the business to appear open and welcoming, but I for one am very much looking forward to their grand opening either way. Hopefully a reasonable accommodation such as window displays could prevent a boycott.

				I am surprised by everyone&#039;s responses and I am guessing that most of you have not seen the windows or you might feel differently.&nbsp; And let&#039;s be clear - I did not suggest a boycott.&nbsp; <br /><br />If they have the kind of display in the new place that they currently have across the street, that would be fine.&nbsp; But it looks like they cannot even get to windows.<br /><br /><br />

				Its all about the details.&nbsp; Unfortunately we often judge a book by its cover--and a store by its window display.&nbsp; Its Retailing 101--so hopefully once he is finished with the inside of the store, he will pay attention to the windows.&nbsp; Seeing the back of refrigerators is pretty ugly for a store that hopefully will be a great addition to the neighborhood and offer a great selection of healthy organic food and produce.

				I think many of us like the neighborhood&#039;s landmark designation in part because it keeps the area looking a certain way.&nbsp; Aesthetics apply to architecture, cleanliness and other factors that make the community desirable.&nbsp; Attractive window displays make strolling thru&#039; a neighborhood pleasurable. My comments have nothing to do with the owner&#039;s being a nice man or the fact that we are happy that he is opening.&nbsp; He is and we are, but these are separate issues.<br /><br />The new storefronts on 82nd off Roosevelt have metal gates on the INSIDE behind the window displays.&nbsp; This makes a HUGE difference when the stores are closed.&nbsp; The street is lighter and the block doesn&#039;t turn into a wall of metal at night.&nbsp; What a great improvement!

				The windows issue is easily remedied by putting up attractive posters. Or they can hand something attractive in the windows (curtains etc.) This is a low-cost solution.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the owner had much choice with how the room is laid out.&nbsp; The refrigerators had to go somewhere and that was probably the most practical and efficient use of space.&nbsp; I&#039;m certain the owner is open to suggestions.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				It&#039;s not ALL the windows…partially on 37th Avenue (also blocking a set of doors) and all windows on 84th Street. Unless they get a very agile small person to climb OVER the refrigeration units, it won&#039;t happen.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see if they can even get the work permits and brown paper out.&nbsp; Best case will likely be decals affixed to the windows from the outside if they even do that much.&nbsp; Between this and Rite Aid, the avenue is a becoming a corridor of retail shops with non-windows.&nbsp; <br />

				If someone would curate, I am sure the JHBG would offer copies of its original photos and ephemera on Jackson Heights, to be displayed in front of the refrigerator units, facing the street.&nbsp; Originals would be faded by the sun, so they could not be used, but copies should do just fine.&nbsp; If someone can arrange this, let me know.

				I walked over today. The windows are still papered over, but I found an unlocked door, went in and wandered around for about 10 minutes looking at stuff before someone approached me and said they are not open yet. They hope to do so tomorrow. The place looked pretty good though during my accidental sneak peak. It&#039;s not entirely finished yet, and it seems like some equipment still needs to be installed. Comparatively, the space feels spacious and the aisles are pretty wide. It&#039;s an all around upgrade. I&#039;m looking forward to a more authorized tour tomorrow or this weekend.

				They were open today--still stocking some of the shelves and getting organized a bit, but otherwise looking good inside. Certainly happy it&#039;s not another discount store or pharmacy.

				this is not about the windows, sorry to dissapoint ;) but now time to focus on what&#039;s on the inside folks!<br />I am very impressed by the size of the store, huge for a natural/organic market, as well as nicely organized.<br />Resembles markets I have been in, in Brooklyn and the prices are more or less what they would be in Brooklyn natural markets.&nbsp; It&#039;s simply another great addition to our &#039;hood ! 2014 is looking up for JH&nbsp; :D

				I just saw this thread and all I can say is this supermarket is a welcomed addition to JHs.&nbsp; The fact that they have so much organic and green products is so damn wonderful I was practically vibrating with joy when I was inside.&nbsp; Then add to that the place is bright, clean, attractively decorated …. I can&#039;t think of anything negative to say because I&#039;m thrilled to have something like this here.&nbsp; To complain about one side of the building seems so damn petty to me.&nbsp; I guess some people will always find something to complain about.&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t been there yet, but my husband went yesterday and said he likes this addition to the neighborhood. He thinks the prices for organic produce are pretty reasonable, and it&#039;s nice that we can walk there instead of having to drive to other places. He said that one of the workers were complaining about the door setup because cold air rushes in everytime the door opens. Maybe one of those plastic outer doors might help? Either way, welcome to the area, Natural Market!
