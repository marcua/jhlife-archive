				I bought some online and got them in 8 days, but they don&#039;t guarantee a certain delivery date so who knows. The ones I bought were $30 for 50 plus $8 delivery charge.<br /><br />The site is slow to load but it does seem to work if you wait long enough. https://lollicupstore.com/karat-face-mask-with-elastic-ear-loop-50-pcs.html<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/9dzmHY5.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/k0pqUYf.jpg)<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/a6VYoWW.jpg)<br /><br />

				Remember, unless you are a medical professional or essential worker, non-medical grade masks are just as effective. &#039;<br /><br />We bought a couple cotton masks from a maker in Brooklyn off of Etsy. And if you have any kind of cotton fabric or handkerchiefs, there are lots of videos on how to turn into effective masks.

I would share the Etsy links where I bought masks, but the first one I bought was so miserable I had to throw away (material I couldn’t breathe through and elastics too loose so it sagged on my face) and luckily, the second one from a different maker is fantastic, but the artisan is taking a break after being overwhelmed with work and sales. <br /><br />Thanks for the link to the disposable masks as well. Different types of products will suit people differently so it’s nice to have options.

				hi I ordered masks from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. They said deliver sometime in June- thought is was odd but the cost was very little so I thought &quot;whatever&quot; I know there is a shortage.<br /><br />I got the delivery this past week so maybe try there? <br />I WILL GIVE YOU SOME IF THERE IS A WAY TO MEET YOU!

				Thank you, Heightsman, for your generous offer, and thank you so much to all who replied. Fortuitously I encountered my upstairs neighbor and asked where they were getting theirs, and they very kindly gave me a few. I&#039;ve made notes of the suggested places for replenishing. <br /><br /><br />

				Most places&nbsp; are not selling b/c hospitals and nurses are in need.&nbsp; Best to use a neckerchief or shear scarf. Same difference.

				Small world, I also used https://rsmmedical.com/ - I think they&#039;re NYC based :) took a week or so to get mine, I got the 100 pack of FDA surgical masks for around $75. <br /><br />They had KN95 but those have been sold out for a while, hoping to find some around the city as I heard they&#039;re the highest grade - if anyone knows where those are sold I&#039;d love to know!!<br /><br />For quick errands like getting my mail I just use a cloth bandana but use the surgical masks for going out &amp; for groceries. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19854.msg98898.html#msg98898">Quote from: gemsiren on April 17, 2020, 03:13:22 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">An acquaintance of mine in Ridgewood is making and selling reusable cloth masks.

				In case anyone is still looking, I ordered some homemade masks from this place in Brooklyn and got them within a week. I wish they used a thicker fabric for the cotton layers, but they do have a non-woven polypropylene middle layer, which I’ve read is a good filter-type fabric. They are beautifully sewn, comfortable and easy enough to slit if one wanted to add a 4th layer of something. I’m still very much in the exploring and experimenting phase with masks but thought I’d share since these are at least nicely made and mail right away. They also have homemade face shields and “gowns”<br /><br />&nbsp;https://bk-textiles.com/

				Masks have become the fashion accessory. You can find all colors and patterns on eBay and Amazon. And you don&#039;t have to go out to get them. They are delivered to you. I would caution though against the real inexpensive ones. Most of those are made in China and it&#039;s takes a long time to get here. Besides, we should be supporting USA right now. I brought some that are made in USA and they have a lapel size flag off to the side to prove it.
