			I was born in Physicians hospital in 1950, lived on 84th Street and Roosevelt Ave till we moved to Bayside in 1969.&nbsp; Went to Garden School from 1955 to 1967, and we spent a lot of time in the park across 78th Street!&nbsp; Spent a lot of recesses there and remember being a crossing guard in 5th and 6th grade, and having the crossing from Garden as my post.&nbsp; Do they still allow kids to climb on Monkey Bars over asphalt? Remember in High School that&nbsp; Garden Varsity Home Soft Ball games we’re held in the Park. Also remember taking Driver’s Ed and starting and ending driving sessions at the park.&nbsp; Anyone remember Nick’s Coffee Shop on the north side of Northern Blvd?&nbsp; A long time ago!!

			LOL I have no idea who you, Lynne Brophy are but we have the exact opposite tastes/memories concerning the teachers you named. I had Mrs. Levy in the 4th Grade (I think it was 1961) and she was one of the nicest, kindest teachers I ever had. I had Mr. Jacobowitz&nbsp; who changed his name to Javits in the beginning of the 5th grade and he was one of the nastiest most miserable vile people I have ever had the misfortune to know. I had forgotten about him till now- thanks for reminding me of a truly evil human being I had forgotten about for over 50 years! Luckily after a few months they transferred part of the class including me to Mrs. Millstein&#039;s class. who was so-so. Jacobowirz was such a nasty work of art he tried to get a kid transferred out of the school (I don&#039;t remember if he did) because he lived a few blocks out of the district. The rest of your memories I share good thoughts on but that fish store that sold French Fries was not open that long or kids were forbidden to buy French Fries their or something- Maybe my nutso mother whose still living forbade me to go there in one of her insane actions. I have memories of being insane myself of going to the 78 street park in the middle of a freezing winter with ice on the ground &amp; playing basketball on the courts when I was 14 a few times.<br /><br />
