				Hi! Thanks for the interest. <br /><br />We&#039;ve been working away on the design-side of things while permit issues are getting sorted out. Things are complicated, but we&#039;re working them out. We don&#039;t have an estimated opening date yet, hopefully soon we&#039;ll be able to know roughly when that will be, and then we&#039;ll start posting news, updates and announcements. Right now there&#039;s nothing exciting to share, unless you&#039;re interested in learning about Alteration Type I permits and such&nbsp; ;D

				I don&#039;t see any evidence that anything is happening at that storefront. In fact, there&#039;s a &quot;stores for rent&quot; sign posted on the 80th St side of the building. Perhaps the venture was defeated by all the difficulties. How can anyone afford to rent space and wait endlessly for all these permits and approvals?

				Selling wine and beer seems to requires a different license than liquor. My understanding is it&#039;s easier to get than a liquor license. So a place that wants to forgo a bar and mixed drinks will have an easier time of it.

				I&#039;ve been wondering about this place myself for a while now. I walked passed it today and saw some serious construction going on. The gates were not open, they work with the gates closed. This place was huge inside. I asked the contractor what are you guys building? He told me &quot; a bar and bistro, it should be open in about three months &quot; Now we know for sure that it&#039;s coming so we can all relax now lol..

				The previous post is right on. As a former cafe owner I learned the hard way not to share too much info before you&#039;re ready. City permits can delay you at the last minute, as can cash crunches. When you tell people about an opening that then doesn&#039;t happen, you lose credibility. All news has to be carefully parsed out.

				I happened to walk by a few weeks ago and was able to see inside.&nbsp; I confirmed that there has been no work done on the space for several months.&nbsp; However, based on what has already completed, it has real potential with an open kitchen and a large bar area.&nbsp; If it ever gets completed it has the potential to be a neighborhood changing restaurant.&nbsp; So if the developers are reading this, I hope you find the money to keep going!&nbsp;

				according to his profile, it&#039;s been over a year since Dudley has been &quot;active&quot; on the board in any way -- not that he needs to keep anyone apprised of his doings, but for a once-regular poster to disappear entirely doesn&#039;t bode well for the venture. just hope nothing serious has happened.

				Here is something that puzzles me. When the heated discussions about gentrification get going--especially in regards to projects like The Queensboro and Swim Two Birds--there are always people who say that JH is a neighborhood of struggling immigrants and cannot support more upscale restaurants for that reason. And we should not expect--or want-- that fact to change. We are a neighborhood that showcases inexpensive cuisines from the many cultures represented here. Get over it--go to Manhattan or Brooklyn or okay, LIC if you want bistros and wine bars and craft cocktails, etc. <br /><br />Well, we had dinner Saturday night at Uncle Peter&#039;s on Northern, where we noticed the top entree price is now something like $46. The place is has been a fixture here for a long time and is busy whenever we&#039;ve been there. So how can Uncle Peter&#039;s survive here if nobody can afford to eat in a place like that? And it&#039;s not the only local restaurant that can be quite pricey. So I don&#039;t buy that argument that all JH can support based on &quot;what the market wants&quot; is 99 cent stores and budget-priced restaurants. There are plenty of people here from all over the world who frequent these pricey restaurants and bring their whole family--I&#039;ve seen large groups eating at places that were far from cheap, where I might hesitate to bring a gaggle of kids along with the grownups for that reason. Thoughts?
