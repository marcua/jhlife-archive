				...and this is its kitchen:<br />https://streeteasy.com/building/37_49-81st-street-queens/7a?similar=1<br /><br />Is this not unbelievable? This is a studio apartment sized kitchen. Who would design an apartment like this?

				It&#039;s a condo=liquidity/flexibility for investment.<br /><br />It has a terrace.....<br /><br />You could redesign the interior with pressure walls etc to something quite shiny. But yes, that is trash design.

				It is not unusual for developers to use stock kitchens and rental grade bath finishes to complete projects in order to get a certificate of Occupancy and pass on upgrade project to a purchaser (which is very well the case here). Bigger issue with this one is that the envelope in which they squeezed&nbsp; a 2 bed 2 bath layout into , would likely more comfortably fit one bed with a good sized windowed kitchen. Since an architectural compromise must have had to be made , they clearly have compromised a functional kitchen. Even if you add an island, you still may have a ventilation issue. <br /><br /><br />

				If I understand correctly, about $15 million worth of condos there were sold to an LLC which has created a new hotel there called the Elmhurst Hotel<br /><br />https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/elmhurst.html<br /><br />Not sure if this was always the plan, but it might also explain the underground parking and the weird room layouts and the small kitchen. And the holes in the walls for AC. The booking.com photos shows some AC installed in them, and also show a &quot;living room&quot; with two huge double beds in it.

				More info:<br /><br />https://www.brownstoner.com/queens/jackson-heights/jackson-heights-development-site-on-the-market-for-big-bucks/<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Feb 28, 2014 <br /><br />An unfinished development site is on the market at 37-59 81st Street, in Jackson Heights. It’s asking $13,000,000. The 5,600-square-foot lot, right off Roosevelt Avenue and close to the 82nd Street 7 train stop, already has major development plans in place. According to the listing, plans include two seven-story towers, one designated for residential use and the other for a hotel. Both buildings include commercial space. DOB permits (http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/JobsQueryByNumberServlet?requestid=2&amp;passjobnumber=410006960&amp;passdocnumber=03) say the design is by Michael Kang Architect.<br /><br />Construction’s already finished on the building foundations, the basement and the ground floor. It’s unclear to us how long the unfinished structure has been sitting there.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				These apts have been on the market sporadically for many months and they haven&#039;t been selling and they likely won&#039;t at that price for several reasons. The apartment is a stone&#039;s throw from Roosevelt and the rumble of the 7 train. The &quot;developer&quot; and &quot;seller&quot; aren&#039;t neighborhood folks and don&#039;t seem to understand the market. The finishes are terrible and while that may what many condo developers do it certainly isn&#039;t helping sell these.

				Someone mentioned that it has a balcony. With a view of Roosevelt Ave and the 7 train? I was amazed when I was first looking at apartments in JH and a realtor took me to see an apartment with a balcony right next to the 7.
