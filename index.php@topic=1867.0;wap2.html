			Google is now hosting an archive of photos from Life magazine. &nbsp;Of course I had to search on &quot;Jackson Heights&quot;. &nbsp;It turned up a very interesting, if uncomfortable, chapter in the neighborhood&#039;s history.<br /><br />In 1964, the city began an effort to integrate neighborhood schools through busing policy. &nbsp;Life magazine captured protests held in Jackson Heights over this issue.<br /><br />Hopefully JH has moved toward a much broader social consensus supporting social integration, but even today this type of busing policy would remain extremely unpopular.
