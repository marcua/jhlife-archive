			Are you or someone you know a &quot;sewist&quot;?&nbsp; NYTimes says that&#039;s the latest non-gender designation of someone who creates with a sewing machine.&nbsp; Want to pass on various types of fabric, mostly cotton of different weights, and various modest lengths.&nbsp; Good for masks, maybe curtains, pillow covers, children&#039;s clothes.&nbsp; Pick up in lobby of the Belvedere, 35th St between 84th-85th.&nbsp;
