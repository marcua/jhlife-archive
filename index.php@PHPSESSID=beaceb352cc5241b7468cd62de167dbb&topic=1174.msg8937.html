								<div class="inner" id="msg_8938">I do not dispute that there are different social norms in other countries, some of which lead to cleaner streets than ours, and some of which lead to dirtier streets than ours. &nbsp;However, I make the distinctly American demand that we treat all of our neighbors equally -- and not have special exceptions, explanations, or excuses for antisocial behavior within our own neighborhood based on ethnicity.<br /><br />Can we have a free, diverse society and clean streets? &nbsp;It&#039;s certainly a lot harder here than in countries where there is little diversity, or in countries where there is little liberty. &nbsp;The only solution as I see it is to put in the hard work as a community to create a new social norm. &nbsp;That means activating all of the various components of the community to participate in keeping it clean, including businesses, residents, enforcement agencies, community groups, etc. &nbsp;It requires putting in the time to meet with people face to face, and to communicate your seriousness of purpose while demonstrating that you respect the people you&#039;re meeting with. &nbsp;It really is hard work. &nbsp;And that it why I have tremendous admiration for our emerging community leaders who are putting in the time and effort. &nbsp;But every time somebody starts pointing at the supposed dirty habits of one or another ethnic group, or the neglectful behavior of one particular segment of the community, it makes it all that much harder to build the trust and working relationships they need to get this problem solved. &nbsp;People are forced into a defensive position, and the litter once again becomes somebody else&#039;s problem rather than a shared problem.<br /><br />I think the 73rd &amp; 74th Street situation can change rapidly when we have elected officials willing to provide leadership. &nbsp;Right now, neither our community board not our city councilwoman is willing to confront the issue. &nbsp;Part of the reason they find it so difficult is that the issue is being framed in terms of race and ethnicity, which makes it risky and infertile terrain for politicians to invest time and effort. &nbsp;I am optimistic that our current crop of candidates for City Council has a better understanding of how to address these issues, and a greater willingness to invest political capital in addressing them once in office. &nbsp;We need to hold their feet to the fire, but we also need to help them by developing ideas and communication channels.<br /><br />So, please, once again, can we discuss what can be done to begin addressing this problem? &nbsp;&#039;Cause I&#039;m really sick of hearing people whine about the dirty foreigners.<br /><br /></div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_8949">having caught up on this thread finally, one thing&nbsp; I&#039;ve noticed is that we&#039;re getting race and culture confused. There&#039;s a big difference between the two. An Inuit raised in Japan form an early age will very likely behave culturally like a Japanese person as opposed to what his / her race might otherwise dictate. Understanding the various cultures that exist in our neighborhood is the first step to solving the problem of litter in the street. Once we know why people behave in certain way we can better address, communicate, and educate. <br /><br />But, it&#039;s a lot harder to educate the masses then it is to deal with the commercial establishments on 73rd and 74th st. (there&#039;s certainly fewer businesses then there are people). Another complication is I&#039;m reasonably certain most of the people who patronize these businesses especially on the weekends do not live in or even near Jackson Heights (as evidenced by the license plates from NJ, PA ,CT). So a lot of these people don&#039;t see the impact of their dropping a coffee cup here or there etc. as they don&#039;t have to walk that way to work on Monday morning. <br /><br />82nd St. while busy and certainly not the perfect picture of cleanliness is still better off than 73rd and 74th streets partially because many of the people who use that street live in the area. Also, some years back 82nd St. was redesigned to allow for increased foot traffic, has more garbage cans, and the 82nd St. BID helps to keep the St. clean. I&#039;ve also noticed a higher police presence on the street. Why the difference ? My theory, the merchants on 82nd St. realized that they would lose local business if they didn&#039;t clean up their act, The merchants on 74th st. are not as affected by members of the local community since most of their business comes form outside the community.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Solutions ? <br /><br />Some coordinated effort on the part of the JH Community as whole that reaches out to the Jackson Heights Merchants Association<a href="https://a069-webapps3.nyc.gov/dsial/Agency_Detail.aspx?id=216" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://a069-webapps3.nyc.gov/dsial/Agency_Detail.aspx?id=216</a>, and the Bangladeshi Merchants Association (Sorry no URL), with petitions, letters, meetings and constant conversations asking these groups to take better care of their streets. <br /><br />Step up and continue calls to 311 to report litter, vandalism, broken laws, etc. to the appropriate departments. <br /><br />Constant communication with local elected officials highlighting these problems. <br /><br />Scrutinize our local electeds and those running for office on their associations, donations and endorsements from groups or orgs. that do not contribute to the JH community in a positive way. <br /><br />And as a last resort, boycott businesses that do not care about the cleanliness of their streets. This may be a challenge as I mentioned above most of the patrons come from outside JH, but with effective education and a visible protest maybe it might help. <br /><br />In the end it comes down to money, the merchants on 73rd and 74th st. are not going to make any more money if their streets are clean, in fact they will lose money (as far as they are concerned) by investing in a BID.&nbsp; But if their political power can be lessened, and they wind up getting more fines from Sanitation, etc. they might soon decide it&#039;s cheaper to invest in a BID.<br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents.</div>

Someone mentioned that maybe I should help with the problem.&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; On numerous occasions I have written and visited Helen Sears along with many others. I have worked and assisted the Beautification Group removing&nbsp; graffiti and planting flowers in the neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just because I posted the countries where the individuals come from which come to our neighborhood to shop and throw litter on the ground, that does not make me a racist.&nbsp; I am more of a racist when people walk around with blinders on and talk the talk like politicians, soft soaping the issues.&nbsp; People who do that are adding to the problem, not the solution.&nbsp; &#039;Politically Correct&#039; has created more of a racist environment in this country and has made a mess of the children of this country.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Children know they have the law behind them when parents want to smack them.&nbsp; Children killing children, a child burning his grandmother because she wouldn&#039;t let him go out, the stories continue every day.&nbsp; So to be Politically Correct,, we can&#039;t mention the country of origin that a group of people which come to our neighborhood and dirty it.&nbsp; &nbsp; That&#039;s garbage (no pun intended).<br /><br />When I found this site and read through some of the posts I saw many topics which are nice for people from the same neighborhood to talk about.&nbsp; Only a few topics that were about real issues.&nbsp; But they seemed kind of sugar coated.&nbsp; Now with this topic, we get into a discussion and someone turns into a racist topic which it&#039;s not.&nbsp; You need to take your blinders off and walk and see the issues.&nbsp; You really need to stop living in a dream land and look at reality.&nbsp; If not, then you should click your heals three times and wake up back in Kansas.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Someone mentioned the Petition, which I think is a great idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;This website is free and can be used.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gopetition.com/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.gopetition.com/</a><br /><br />So in closing, I thought this site was to talk about everything Jackson Heights including really serious issues, but it seems more of a Jackson Heights Fan site.<br /><br />Todd...if you want to delete me, fine.</div>

I see I am not the only one who bristled at the statements made. In real life as well as online, it seems people are more concerned with countering insinuations of bigotry than countering bigotry. I absolutely concur there is a distinction, as Andrew put it, between race and culture, but the particular posts on which I commented did not observe that distinction. Many wish to leap to the postsâ€™ defense by essentially saying many good and accurate things (â€œDifferent people coming from different cultures DO act differently.&nbsp; That is NOT RACISM.â€) that donâ€™t really address the initial problem of the original words of the specific posts which likely reveal something about the authorâ€™s beliefs. That my gripe about the bigoted tone of certain posts created more of a negative reaction than the original posts themselves is really telling. Many people donâ€™t notice bigotry when they see it, and thus are baffled when someone complains about it, and then conclude the complainer must just be upset an issue was brought up at all rather than that it was being addressed in a bigoted way. In other words, the initial provocative comments are seen as benign, and the reaction to it is seen as an inflammatory defamation of character. (â€œI am not a racist but a nice guy, because I do all these nice things and I am a good person who has friends of every colorâ€ rather than discussing the original words that prompted the response.) The nonsense about â€œSo to be Politically Correct,, we can&#039;t mention the country of origin that a group of people which come to our neighborhood and dirty it.â€ is very dismissive and seems a smokescreen to draw attention away from the initial bigotry by insinuating any response to it is by the thought police.</div>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_9000">I think Political Correctness, in this country, is living a lie.&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot; Let&#039;s not notice anyone is different because that&#039;s racist, sexist, etc.&quot;<br /><br />I hate it.&nbsp; Yes, abee, elyaqim words do have consequences.&nbsp; But too many people have &#039;victimized themselves&#039; to the extent that <span class="bbc_u">many</span> words have become offensive.&nbsp; And you&#039;re also right that people can hide behind PC or use it to their advantage but it&#039;s still suppressive.&nbsp; And now we&#039;re really &quot;off topic.&quot;&nbsp; A couple of thoughts I found online on the topic:<br /><br />&gt;&gt;The attitudes and values of the politically correct may well have had their origins in the civil rights and equality campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s, but political correctness is not about protecting the fundamental rights that lie at the heart of these campaigns.&nbsp; It is about limiting or suppressing the way people are able to think and express their views.&nbsp; Political correctness runs counter to the basic freedoms of society, precisely because it is intended to limit the debate on issues of rights and freedoms.&lt;&lt;<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />&gt;&gt;What began as a force for good (considering the number of people who really are racist, sexist and homophobic) has since become a laughing stock beacause of the ridiculous extremes to which certain neurotic ultra-liberals took it - cf. a person being &#039;vertically challenged&#039; rather than short. This has actually undone a lot of progress made in changing bigoted attitudes (as bigot can claim any offence taken at their views is &#039;political correctness gone mad), whilst making people feel guilty for enjoying anything but the blandest, most anaemic humour for fear of being &#039;offensive&#039;. I mean, seriously, what&#039;s funnier out of &#039;Friends&#039; and &#039;South Park&#039;? (Or &#039;The League of Gentlemen&#039; for the benefit of any Brits out there?) <br /><br />At the same time as straight white able-bodied men are going out of their way to talk about &#039;ethnic people&#039; (who ISN&#039;T ethnic!?) and those of &#039;different sexual orientation&#039;, there are blacks calling themselves niggas (which has been going on for years), gays calling themselves (and each other!) poof, queens and queers, and so on - the real way to neutralize a term used as&nbsp; an insult is for those to whom it was applied to use it themselves.<br /><br />AT its worst, political correctness is nothing different form Orwell&#039;s Newspeak - an attempt to change the way people think by forcibly changing the way they speak &lt;&lt;<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />I, personally, don&#039;t think Indians, Pakistanis, Asians are &quot;bad&quot; and German and other Europeans are &quot;good&quot;.&nbsp; That one group is &quot;dirty&quot; the other is &quot;clean&quot;.&nbsp; But I do think they, as people from different countries and cultures, ARE different in some ways.&nbsp; And I hate the fact that people have to pussyfoot around everyone&#039;s differences instead of just accepting that yes, people are different and behave different and think different in many ways.<br /><br />I bristle over that.<br /><br /><br /></div>
