				Hi,<br /><br />I used to live in this building--for about 20 yrs.&nbsp; While it&#039;s in a prime location, it is NOT a well-run co-op building.&nbsp; The sponsor--Centre Manor--still controls the board even though they are not supposed to at this point.&nbsp; Somehow they were able to get this bldg. converted to co-op from rent stabilized or controlled, they sold a few apartments with promises of major changes/updates, and then ended up doing nothing except holding the majority of units and renting these at market prices as longtime residents moved out or died.&nbsp; The small group of owners like myself were powerless in trying to demand changes and better upkeep of the house which the sponsor/owner purposely let deteriorate year after year.&nbsp; For years most of us were stuck with units that we could not sell because no bank would offer a mortgage for these types of co-ops.&nbsp; &nbsp;Our saving grace was cash buyers who were seeking a good co-op to rent in from day 1 and a nonexistent board that asked no questions and never met.&nbsp; While there were a lot of nice residents that live there,&nbsp; the corrupt management, the pest problems, shoddy conditions, and the fact that my unit appreciated so little compared to neighboring buildings eventually drove me to move.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please don&#039;t be fooled by the sham info like inflated prices and square footage that you&#039;ll see on MLS and other sites for apartments there.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a ploy by the sponsor to sell their units which are grossly overpriced.&nbsp; Better to stop by there and talk to a few residents to get the real deal on the building, and I believe you&#039;ll choose to look elsewhere.&nbsp; There are some really great coops in JH but sadly, this is definitely not one of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Also, just saw your post on Donner Gardens, and I can only say that it used to be a better run house compared to 33-33 82nd, in that it was cleaner and better kept, and there was a staff that one could call for maintenance issues.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know much more than that as it was just next door to us.&nbsp; But as I mentioned above, I encourage you to hang around the entrances and talk to some of the residents.&nbsp; Most will gladly give you genuine insider information on what conditions are really like.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hello:<br /><br />I live in the building and enjoy my life here. If you have any specific questions, feel free to contact me.<br />I own my co-op apartment and have for 3 years. The building has issues like any building here but are usually tended to (some later than others).&nbsp; I am not well informed as to the history of the building sponsors.<br />
