				Did anyone attend the community board meeting concerning the dog run last Thursday (May 1)? I am curious whether there&#039;s been any real progress. I know there was an architect at the previous meeting, but I haven&#039;t heard anything about whether it&#039;s really going to happen.

				We have decomposed granite going on the site which should be nice.&nbsp; Jackson Heights is starved for park space so we had little to choose from.&nbsp; We are going to have a large and small dog run.&nbsp; The noise level is not bad under the bridge.&nbsp; We had multiple organizations at the community board meetings looking for more park space but we got the dog run... it will have to do. <br /><br />LC

				I checked with somebody familiar with the dog run project why it had apparently fallen off the Community Board&#039;s agenda without a vote.&nbsp; The answer is that this is a New York State project, does not require CB approval, and will begin construction in early 2009.

				I assume it will be on the north side of the underpass. There&#039;s a large overgrown grassed area there that seems to be about the right size. It seems to be in shade, which is good. Our dog overheats like a bad American car in the summer.

				I just heard back from one of the organizers of the dog run. Apparently, since the land is owned by the Dept. of Transportation, and not city parks, the dog run has to pay for it&#039;s own liability insurance to protect the DOT. So they&#039;re looking into how this can happen, and what their options might be.

				I just moved from Manhattan, and know of at least 2 dog runs there that are not on city/state parks, and both charge a small annual membership fee partly to cover the landowner&#039;s liability insurance - it&#039;s certainly not a bad way to do things - without any additional burden to local taxpayers.

				I had an opportunity to speak with somebody involved in this project.&nbsp; It seems it would be very helpful for supporters of a dog park to show up.<br /><br />The existing design squeezes two separate parks (one for large dogs, one for small dogs) into the space available on the south side of 35th Avenue at 69th Street.&nbsp; A new proposal would allow the small dog park to spread over the entire space available south of 35th Ave., while opening up a larger space for big dogs north of 35th Ave.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how feasible the new larger park proposal is, but getting the Community Board to endorse it would certainly be helpful.

				There&#039;s a larger space north of 35th avenue? (Actually, one of the reasons we chose to move where we did - 35th and 72nd - was the proposed dog run for our large dog). I&#039;d be fine with that, as long as the large dog run isn&#039;t pushed too far out of the neighborhood!

				Marcus, if I&#039;m understanding that right, it just sounds like the larger run would be across the street (ie. still visible/ in the same vicinity of the small dog run), which would be really good, because I&#039;ve checked out the proposed space and wondered if it would be enough room for what was proposed. At least I hope so, because my dog falls under the large-dog category as well! (Though he *loves* small dogs-- he gets down all small on the ground when he sees them so they&#039;ll come over- that might be a bit of a &quot;puppy&quot; thing)

				Who suggested the deomposed granite surface?&nbsp; We have it here at the East River Esplanade dog run in Manhattan and most people hate it claiming it to be dirty and unhealthy.&nbsp; We are in the middle of a civil war over the issue with the renovators trying to convince people that they should like it.

				Update from tonight&#039;s CB meeting:<br /><br />The meeting tonight was well attended (approximately 16 people if I&#039;m not mistaken, including Board members and Jim Wilson of NYSDOT). Mr. Wilson presented a new proposal to the Community Board which will encompass a larger parchment of land on the north side of 35th Avenue, effectively increasing the area by 4,000 Sq. ft. The new proposal included 5 &quot;play elements&quot; which was unanimously voted down to one in each park to allow more space for the dogs to actually run. It was also presented by Mr. Wilson that wood chips would be used to which someone (I didn&#039;t get the gentleman&#039;s name) brought up the fact that much research was done and that the pebbles/stones requested in the original proposal would be preferred, should the budget allow. We&#039;re still in the preliminary stages and this is by no means set in stone as of yet. There is definitely plenty of support for this from the community. We all should expect an e-mail from the Community Board sometime either tomorrow or early next week, including attachments of schematics and the fact sheet that was handed out at the meeting, as well as a projected date for the ground breaking of the new proposal. We&#039;ll be looking forward to the next CB#3 announcement regarding this project!<br /><br />Respectfully submitted<br /><br />

				I was looking over the material that I got at the meeting the other night - which was very productive and encouraging!<br /><br />I noticed that the plans call for two signs â€“ one at the gate for the larger dogs, and an identical sign at the gate for the smaller dogs.&nbsp; It seems that one sign might be sufficient at the shared entrance gate or in the middle of the â€œvestibuleâ€ area - that is inside the first gate; before you make the left or right for the run for your size dog.&nbsp; I know that I am coming to this a bit late but was wondering if anyone else had any thoughts on this? (and I&#039;m sure it would save a few $$$)

				I thought the latest proposal would move the run for large dogs north of 35th Ave., so there would no longer be a shared vestible.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or are they now planning to move both dog runs to the north side?

				The Fall 2009 issue of the Jackson Heights Beautification Group&#039;s newsletter has some information about the dog run.&nbsp; The following is an excerpt from the JHBG&#039;s President, Edwin O&#039;Keefe Westley&#039;s introduction:<br /><br /><strong><em>&quot;Our first Dog Park/Run is a step closer to being built.&nbsp; The JHBG executive committee agreed to co-sponsor it and create a committee within the JHBG.&nbsp; A group of neighbors, JH Crew, will run the committee and be responsible for the Dog Park/Run.&nbsp; We have been working with Community Board 3, NYS Department of Transportation, and JH Crew over the past couple of years to make this a reality.&nbsp; The Dog Park/Run will be located on 69th Street and 35th Avenue at the northwest corner.&nbsp; There will be a 1,700 sq. ft. small dog (25 lbs &amp; under) area and a 4,500 sq. ft. area for large dogs.&nbsp; The surface will be 3 inches of wood chip mulch.&nbsp; One entry box will serve both areas with separate gate panels (small/large) inside the entry box, one trash receptacle for each, and several 8 feet long 1964 World Fair benches with back and arms.&quot;</em></strong><br /><br />By the way, I spotted several copies of JHBG&#039;s latest newsletter at Espresso 77.
