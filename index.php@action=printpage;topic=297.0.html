				I stopped by for some shopping earlier today at the Fairway in Red Hook.&nbsp; Before leaving, I had to visit the customer service desk where I happened to notice a delivery service sign.&nbsp; As I casually mentioned to my husband that I was pretty sure they didn&#039;t deliver to our place, the woman attending the desk asked if we lived in Brooklyn.&nbsp; I said no...Queens.&nbsp; She said, &quot;Oh...then you&#039;ll be happy to know that Fairway will be opening another market in Queens.&quot;&nbsp; She went on to explain that they had not narrowed down the location yet, but were strongly considering either Astoria or Five Towns.&nbsp; If this indeed happens down the road, I would much prefer an Astoria location. :rockon:<br /><br />Has anyone heard any info on this?

Thanks for taking the time to contact us. It is very gratifying to hear that you enjoy shopping our Red Hook location and that you even bring your friends!<br />&nbsp;<br />Regarding your request, our upper management regularly reviews potential sites for new stores throughout the greater NYC metro area, including of course the 5 boroughs. It is a somewhat exhaustive process, weighing both the pros and cons for each site.<br />&nbsp;<br />I cannot commit to a site in Queens or even the possibility of a site. I can say that we give careful consideration to all of the site proposals or areas put before us.<br />&nbsp;<br />Thank you for your continued patronage and we hope to continue to serve you in the future.<br />&nbsp;<br />Respectfully,<br />Joe Lucido<br />Fairway Markets<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />----- Original Message -----<br />From: Lorrie&nbsp; &lt;mailto:NYCMacUser@att.net&gt;<br />To: info@fairwaymarket.com<br />Sent: Sunday, January 06, 2008 4:26 PM<br />Subject: Pulleeze Open A Store in Astoria<br /><br />I have been schlepping down to Red Hook (Brooklyn) almost every week now for months to do my weekly shopping. Every time I go I have to take 3-4 friends with me. That limits me to my shopping because there is just so much my trunk can hold. Sure there are supermarkets in Astoria, but they are, errr, hmmm, how shall I say this . . . really crappy by comparison.<br /><br />And if you could find a location that would offer parking, I promise I will never shop anywhere else ever again in my whole life!<br /><br />Lorrie<br />

				Lorrie, you managed to get a response.&nbsp; I sent off two e-mails on two separate occasions, and have yet to receive an answer.&nbsp; From the response you received, is it safe to assume that this person just doesn&#039;t want to let the cat out of the bag prematurely, or is he just bursting our Queens Fairway bubble?<br /><br />Thinking back on my visit to Fairway, the employee that gave me the Queens scoop seemed more convinced than not that a Queens location is in the works.&nbsp; I can keep hoping!&nbsp;

				I have often thought that the vacant bank that is across from LaGuardia Community College would be a good place for this type of business. Balducci&#039;s on 14th took over a former bank site. I have written to both Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#039;s.&nbsp; Will now write to Fairway.

				I like Fairway because it&#039;s like having a huge specialty market bundled together with a traditional style supermarket.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many one stop shopping places that stock both artisan aged Manchego and Oscar Mayer Turkey Bologna!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; I shop at the Red Hook location, and have never had issues with cleanliness, other than with the small messes that some people leave at the tables out back after eating.

				Fairway doesn&#039;t strike me as dirty but I could see why, in this age of pretty stores, it could make somebody think that. It&#039;s sort of set up in more of a functional, put out as much as possible store than a modern pretty sort of place. I think the lack of beautiful shelving, really nice flooring, etc. gives it kind of a disheveled old look. But it&#039;s actually also what I like about it -- it has a crazy energy to it and it really is packed with a ton of good stuff.

				OK, so the following may be read as a confirmation that there indeed will be a Fairway Market coming to Queens. &nbsp;Alas, its location will be Douglaston as posted above.<br /><br />Another Fairway Market For Long Islanders (And Queens) (http://www.longislandpress.com/2009/07/23/another-fairway-market-for-long-islanders-and-queens/)<br /><br />You know what? &nbsp;If I&#039;m going to be driving to a Fairway, it&#039;s going to be the one in Red Hook! &nbsp;BTW, that Fairway on the Upper West Side (Broadway &amp; 76th) is a madhouse. &nbsp;Steer clear!

				There&#039;s been a bit more news lately on the Fairway opening in Douglaston. &nbsp;But for those who get around mainly via subway, the one being planned for the Upper East Side might be more convenient. &nbsp;(It will still be a haul.) &nbsp;Apprarently there&#039;s a Whole Foods being planned for the UES as well.<br /><br />http://www.realnydeal.com/2010/02/fairway-grocery-store-may-be-coming-to.html<br /><br /><em>Upper East Side residents may soon have a better selection of produce and dairy products to choose from. Fairway Market is in negotiation for a lease at 240 E. 86th St., between Second and Third avenues, according to two real estate sources.<br /><br />...The Upper East Side spot would be the supermarket&#039;s third Manhattan spot and would give neighborhood residents access to a popular supermarket alternative that often hands out free samples. Other than Gristedes, D&#039;Agostino and the Food Emporium, the area also has gourmet options such as Citerella and Agata &amp; Valentina. Whole Foods is planning to open in two years at the corner of East 57th Street and Second Avenue, but will be too far south to impact the neighborhood.</em>

				Totally agree with you Buddy I have always found Fairway a bit too dirty for my taste.&nbsp; I have never shopped at just one market I head over to Astoria for my favorite Italian and Greek foodstuff and for my Asian items, pork and seafood I shop at a market on 31st Ave. in the low 50&#039;s and for Latin food and produce it&#039;s the Food Bazaar on Junction and 34Th Ave.&nbsp; Sadly JH lacks a good Italian bakery but Astoria has many.&nbsp; Unfortunately if you don&#039;t have a car this kind of shopping would be a bit diffcult but for me there has never been such a thing as &quot;one stop shopping&quot;.<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=297.msg3780.html#msg3780">Quote from: buddy on March 23, 2008, 11:59:54 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have a friend in the City who likes Fairway.&nbsp; Buys great olives and cheeses there.&nbsp; I went once and thought it was so dirty.&nbsp; Am I missing it&#039;s charm????<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I have never found the Fairways to be dirty.&nbsp; The original location on UWS is too crowded and chaotic; I agree the best one for now is in Red Hook.&nbsp; The food quality at Fairway is superior to anything you can find in JH (although the quality has gone down a bit with all the expansion).&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to find a decent orange or apple in the markets in JH.&nbsp; For some reason even the small fruit and produce stores do not offer the quality you can find in Astoria markets.&nbsp; When I do not have time to go to Fairway, the Berry Farms in the shopping center on Ditmars &amp; 48th is best alternative.&nbsp; I look forward to the Douglaston Fairway -- and hope drive is better than down the BQE to Red Hook. <br />

				The Douglaston branch of Fairway is now scheduled to open November 16th.&nbsp; It&#039;s been a long time coming! <br /><br />I&#039;m still driving to Red Hook.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br /><strong>New York Daily News</strong><br />Fairway to heaven: Queens residents anxiously await opening of 55,000 square-foot food oasis (http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/10/04/2011-10-04_boros_fairway_to_heaven.html)<br />BY Lisa L. Colangelo<br />DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER <br />Tuesday, October 4th 2011, 4:00 AM<br /><br />In a few short weeks, the gutted former Waldbaum&#039;s in Douglaston will be transformed into a food oasis.<br /><br />Fairway is set to open its first Queens store on Nov. 16 and, at 55,000-square feet, will be its largest in the five boroughs.<br /><br />Owner Howie Glickberg said shoppers will be greeted with rows of fresh produce when they walk through the doors of the new store, currently under construction at the Douglaston Plaza shopping center off the Long Island Expressway.<br /><br />&quot;We are recreating what people had 30 or 40 years ago when they had their own neighborhood butcher, fish and produce stores,&quot; Glickberg told the Daily News during a tour of the construction site yesterday. &quot;We even roast our own coffee. We&#039;re doing it the old-fashioned way.&quot;<br /><br />Community Board 11 Chairman Jerry Iannece said the community has been &quot;anxiously awaiting&quot; the opening of the store.<br /><br />He pointed out that residents who live in the area, especially seniors and people without cars, have had to travel long distances to buy basic groceries.<br /><br />&quot;This was unacceptable,&quot; he said.<br /><br />The store will offer a large selection of organic food as well as Kosher meat and poultry, Glickberg said. Bread, pastry and other items also will be baked on site, he said.<br /><br />Shoppers can also take a break in the 60-seat cafe.<br /><br />Glickberg said Fairway, which has eight stores in the metro area - including Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island - has staked its reputation on providing high quality at low prices.<br /><br />&quot;We have 60 different kinds of olives, over 600 different kinds of cheese,&quot; he said, walking through the future deli section, as construction workers buzzed around him.<br /><br />Plans for the borough&#039;s first Fairway have been in the works for over two years. Transfer of the property was slow and there were some minor zoning issues to contend with.<br /><br />Fairway also did a top-to-bottom renovation of the former Waldbaum&#039;s building, which included new infrastructure and a 15,000-foot expansion.<br /><br />&quot;We have tremendous support from the community,&quot; said Glickberg. &quot;People are telling us there are no good food stores around here. They just want a Fairway.&quot;<br /><br />

				Yes, agree that until Douglaston opens the best Fairway choice for JHers is Melville.... it is right off the Northern State and tvl. time should be 25-30 mins. sans tfc. jams. The Douglaston store will be bigger...

				And yes, Plainview is MUCH easier to get to and to deal with than Red Hook... although Red Hook is interesting for other reasons!

The drive to Red Hook should take no less than 21 minutes and no more than 30, even on the weekend. Plainview is at least 40 minutes and can be as much as an hour. So that&#039;s almost twice as long. Plus Red Hook has Ikea down the road&nbsp; :D

				Red requires getting on the dreaded BQE; Plainview is a straight shot on Northern St.!

				And you prefer the Northern St, aka the speedway, over the BQE? The BQE has improved alot in the last couple of years. I used to hate it too. The only bad part of it is the Kosciusko bridge. If you exit at Atlantic ave instead of Hamilton it takes an extra 5 mins off the drive.

				I&#039;ve long had a rule about the BQE...which is quite simple - never, ever get on it. (Sidney Lumet also had that as a rule for making movies in NYC.) <br />Is it really better? I may have to try it.<br />One minute from F&#039;way to the Northern St. and then about 25 minutes to Exit 5 in old JH. Works for me. Plus a lot of cool things to do in the Plainview/Huntington area.

				Yes, the Fairway is pretty amazing. Great selection, great deals, amazing quality, and cool cafe. Every food market should be like this. And it is great to have one so near and with a parking lot!

				This last time I stopped in on the way back from further out on the island, but from JH it is not a super-quick drive... one feels like it is a real trip out to LI... from JH it is about 20-25 mins. Check your route first or use GPS... it can be a bit confusing. It is awesome... plan to have a meal at their cafe, and look around end caps for special deals.
