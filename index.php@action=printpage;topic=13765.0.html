				YES! Thank you for posting this info about the meeting. I&#039;ve been following the threads here regarding the noise for a while, first time posting a comment about it. I will be going to that meeting, just as we all should!! <br /><br />It&#039;s becoming UNBEARABLE. I was out running errands last weekend, in and around the 70&#039;s &amp; Northern Blvd -- Huge 747 came roaring right overhead directly towards me. Simply too low and too loud -- it was frightening. Dreading waking up at 6am tomorrow to do a repeat of it all again this weekend.<br /><br />

While the planes leaving LGA are horribly loud, there are no 747s at LaGuardia right now. A 747 can be recognized because it&#039;s a double-decker with a second upper set of windows in a &quot;hump.&quot;<br /><br />But yeah, that&#039;s been an awfully loud area the past few weekends. We should get some screen caps of when the noise monitors go red on Webtrak. They go REALLY red.

				Thanks for sharing Abu!<br /><br />Would&#039;ve been nice to have the meeting scheduled on an upper floor classroom or Travers Park to get a good sense of the noise that the typical resident experiences.<br /><br />
