				&nbsp; Thanksgiving happens to be one of my favorite holidays and being from the deep South I have some traditional dishes I serve every year.&nbsp; I will admit that I have tweaked my mama&#039;s recipes to make them my own and thankfully she approves!&nbsp; This year I will be smoking a turkey in a ceramic kamado grill using hickory chips for that wonderful smokey flavor along with rutabagas (yellow turnips), collard greens, macaroni and cheese, candied sweet potatoes, garlic mashed Yukon potatoes, cornbread dressing, giblet gravy, homemade cranberry sauce and for dessert we will have sweet tater pie and a sinfully rich black bottom pie.&nbsp; A meal laden with carbs and mucho calories but what the hell it&#039;s only once a year!!&nbsp; :smitten:

				What time should I be there?<br /><br />Seriously, if I were home I would be making a mixed green salad with lots of other colors in it - radish, red and yellow peppers, scallions, and a little of the mixture saved out to be tossed with some drained canned mandarin oranges for those who like a little sweet bite with the salad. A light dijon dressing on the side.<br /><br />We are a big family and each member cooks one dish. I will report back from the home front when I get the report. These are black belt cooks, and the first few years I was there, I got to bring the paper plates and napkins. Working up to salad and desserts before I decided to be away this year.<br /><br />Have a Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!!

				mine&#039;s kind of basic. as the only child of a single mom, we didn&#039;t do a lot of fanciness, but my mom and grandma went to great pains to make sure we had traditions. i hold to the homemade cranberry sauce -- coarse ground with orange zest and rind -- and sage-y bread stuffing. my own additons over the years now include a maple walnut yam bake and a corn pudding that sometimes includes crab meat (this year, it&#039;s in there). my former significant other was vegetarian, so for a few years, my main course was an acorn squash, baked, with a wild rice, dried fruit and walnut stuffing. kinda yum in its own right.

				In the past my family has traditionally eaten poppy seed and caraway seek salt sticks as the dinner roll - something like this <br /><br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/4138879152_1f93dfd9e6.jpg)<br />http://en.petitchef.com/recipes/poppy-and-caraway-seed-rolls-fid-551359<br />except the recipe I have used in the past is different (no shortening).<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering if there might be some less labor-intensive dinner rolls I can make? &nbsp;I know I may not exactly win points for great Thanksgiving chef of the year.<br /><br />How does this recipe look?<br />http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipes/1465<br /><br />I have to decide quickly - Wednesday is baking (or buying) day.<br /><br />P.S. I don&#039;t have a bread machine or a dough mixing machine.

				@Shelby you can buy premade dough at the met. It is in a little refrigerator in front of the deli counter. If they don&#039;t have anymore you can ask the deli counter person. They cost 75 cents. I use them when I don&#039;t want to fuss with making dough and have made a variety of things (pizza, zeppoles, calzones, rollups, rolls, bread, cinnamon buns etc). I am cooking so much turkey, ham, Lasagne, mac and cheese, veggies, cheesecake, cookies etc. I try to make a few things easier!!

				It&#039;s that time of year again, so I&#039;m reviving this thread.&nbsp; Maybe we can try some of the foods discussed within.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smitten:<br /><br />Can someone please explain if there is a significant difference in flavor between sweet potatoes and yams?&nbsp; Some markets label them incorrectly making it hard to choose.&nbsp; Also, can yams be substituted in a sweet potato casserole without sacrificing flavor?

				Reviving this thread since Thanksgiving is not too far off.<br /><br />I just came across a group of Thanksgiving recipe videos from the New York Dining section.&nbsp; Each video highlights holiday favorites as well as the not so traditional.&nbsp; Thought I&#039;d share.&nbsp; <br /><br />New York Times Dining - Thanksgiving Recipes (http://www.nytimes.com/video/thanksgiving-recipes/?ref=dining&amp;smid=tw-nytdining)<br /><br />Editing to add a link to Serious Eats.&nbsp; They have a few nice variations on how to prepare cranberry sauce.&nbsp; <br /><br />Serious Eats (http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/11/sauced-five-cranberry-sauce-variations-for-thanksgiving.html)

				Thanks for reviving this thread.<br /><br />The recipe links are nice but I liked reading about other people&#039;s meals, family customs and traditions.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m probably going to go with my standby meal:<br /><br />Smoked turkey split peat soup with sage rubbed croutons<br />Oven roasted turkey with gravy<br />Whole grain bread stuffing (dressing) with carrots, celery, leeks, chestnuts, cognac, and<br />&nbsp; turkey stock<br />Yam casserole with fresh orange juice and rum<br />Garlic mashed potatoes<br />Sauteed snap peas with carrot batons<br />Sauteed mushroom medley (depending on market)<br />My mother-in-law&#039;s cranberry relish<br />My neighbor&#039;s cranberry chutney<br />My pear/ginger/star anise chutney<br /><br />Either an apple tart or tart tatin with homemade cinnamon ice cream<br />Calvados<br />Coffee/Espresso/Tea/etc<br /><br />Assorted Chocolates<br /><br />What are others making?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				for years, I had a vegetarian significant other, so I had to make a second main course, which was, as a rule, acorn squash stuffed with veggie sausage, walnuts, water chestnuts and root veg.<br /><br />now, I have a rotation that involves:<br />roast turkey. nothing fancy<br />old-school sage-onion bread stuffing<br />orange-maple sweet potatoes<br />corn pudding<br />Brussels sprouts with bacon<br />green beans with greenmarket mushrooms<br />one more wildcard veg.<br /><br />

				We&#039;re hosting this year for the first time and will not have a traditional turkey.&nbsp; True to my guy&#039;s Texan roots, we are instead making turkey chili!&nbsp; Half my family is not pleased but they&#039;ll have to deal.&nbsp; The other half is relieved because they not-so-secretly hate turkey on the bone.&nbsp; We plan to placate the traditionalists with green bean casserole, garlic sour cream mashed potatoes, cranberry something or other, and pumpkin pie.&nbsp;

				Years ago my sister declared that she was the &quot;Official and only Thanksgiving Dinner Provider&quot;.&nbsp; Since she lived in that wonderland called &quot;South Jersey&quot;, dinner was on the Saturday after Thanksgiving:&nbsp; so you don&#039;t have to deal with the traffic; as my brother-in-law decreed. <br /><br />Not wanting to have two huge &quot;Thanksgiving Dinners&quot; the NY family would have a traditional lasagne with sausage, meatballs, etc.<br /><br />Miss my sister but not the rest<br /><br />But you know, somehow Grandma&#039;s and my Mom&#039;s no frills, no measure, just throw it the oven meals were the best ever.&nbsp; And a Mrs. Smith&#039;s Pie for dessert.

				I&#039;m always looking for a way to make Thanksgiving seem a bit more traditional.&nbsp; Coming from an Ecuadorian household, our Thanksgivings have always included roast pork in addition to a turkey with Latino flavor.&nbsp; Throw in some empanadas, some rice with pigeon peas, beet salad, stuffing and pumpkin pie, and we&#039;re set.&nbsp; Oh, cranberry sauce pairs very nicely with roast pork.

				Hi. Thanks for your help. I decided to try my hand at a three sisters stew, white corn arepas, apple-cranberry-honey-my-invention side dish, currant wine or Cassis (which I can transform into Kir Royale for Christmas), and dried cherries for desert, maybe mint tea. <br />For the three sisters, do you have any ideas to perk up the flavor other than cook one day beforehand and reheat? Which pole bean should I use?<br />As an aside, chocolate truffles drenched in Cassis is the bomb. And leftover three sisters should make a nice soup; add wild rice.
