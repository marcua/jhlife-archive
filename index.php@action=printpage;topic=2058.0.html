				http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/01/07/2009-01-07_zap_con_ed_wins_56_rate_increase.html<br /><br />Taxes, water bills and the cost of a subway ride are all rising - and so is your electric bill.<br /><br />Con Edison won approval Wednesday to hike its power bills by 5.6% in April, citing higher costs and the higher property taxes it has to pay to the city.<br /><br />The proposed increase is less than the 7.3% Con Ed had been requesting - but comes a year after customers were hit with a 4.7% rate increase.<br /><br />Much of the increase was driven by higher property taxes, but the judicial panel that approved the hike reduced what Con Ed said it needed for new employee salaries and stockholder profits.

				It all hurts but in my situation it will represent an increase of $4 a month.&nbsp; What hurts is the cooperative maint increase in 2009 which is $88.&nbsp; I feel sorry for the business owners such as restaurants who already pay an enormous monthly electric bill and are now faced with customers who are eating out less.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even begin to imagine what laudermats pay each month for electricity.&nbsp; I&#039;ve cut back on electricity by installing the new energy smart light bulbs and turning off the computer at the end of the day and restarting it the next morning.&nbsp;

				Interestingly enough one of Con Ed&#039;s justifications for an increase was that people were actually using LESS electricity !!!! <br /><br />The price of oil has dropped significantly too, so I&#039;m not sure I understand why they need to raise rates.
