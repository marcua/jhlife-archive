			When I moved to JH about 5 1/2 years ago, I wanted to move into a rental building for two reasons -- first, I was moving here from out of town and didn&#039;t have time to do much pavement pounding to visit individual-owned apartments; and second, in the past I had much better experiences dealing with larger building management companies than with small-time landlords/property managers.<br /><br />I read an article in the Village Voice about JH featuring Washington Plaza (73-12 35th Ave.), and decided I wanted to live there.&nbsp; But I could find no information online about who to contact about renting an apartment there.&nbsp; I ended up asking my parents, who live on Long Island, to visit the building to see if they could find somebody to talk with.&nbsp; Fortunately, that one building happens to have an office out front, and they were able to get the contact information for the management company (via a broker who charged me 1 month&#039;s rent). <br /><br />Perhaps information on rental buildings in JH is now more readily available than it was 5 years ago.&nbsp; For example, I found the broker for the Washington Plaza here: http://www.rentanapt.net/rental_new_features_page2.htm.&nbsp; But I haven&#039;t seen a list of JH rental buildings, and I imagine something of the sort would be useful if it doesn&#039;t exist.<br /><br />So my questions for the board are:<br />Do you know of an online list of JH rental buildings, including contact information?<br />If not, do you know of any other buildings besides the Washington Plaza?&nbsp; &nbsp;Please provide the building name, address, and (if known) contact information.<br /><br />Thanks!

			Erospolitico mentioned a rental building in a separate post.&nbsp; Mind you, his post wasn&#039;t very favorable toward the property.&nbsp; He listed it as:<br /><br />The Crestwood<br />35-55 73rd Street<br /><br />Management:&nbsp; http://www.pelcorp.com/<br /><br />The Crestwood name appears on the Pelcorp website.

			I know someone who lives in a rental building on 84th St. between 37th and 35th Ave.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have the address available, but it is the first residential building on the right as you turn off 37th Ave on to 84th St.&nbsp; As far as I know, it&#039;s a nice place to live.&nbsp; The building is owned and run by Fisher Management in Manhattan. <br />
