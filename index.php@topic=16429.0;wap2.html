			<strong>Nagelberg</strong>:
			<br />
			I am sorry to report the passing of Rod L. Ekstam, who departed this&nbsp; life at his home in Paducah. Kentucky on May 1, 2017.&nbsp; He was 75 years old and is survived by his wife, Marilyn Ekstam of Paducah.<br />Rod was my oldest friend. and we grew up in a Jackson Heiths that has all but faded from memory. I met Rod in the P.S. 69 schoolyard when we were both in the Third Grade.&nbsp; Our home room teacher was<br />a buck toothed hawk-nose old biddy named Mrs. McKey who was rumored to have hated boys--especially wise guys like us.&nbsp; &nbsp;We probably spent more time in the 69 schoolyard than the school itself,<br />but the schoolyard is where we parked ourselves all the way through high school graduation.&nbsp; I could write volumes about this one aspect of Jackson Heights Life, but the task is daunting.&nbsp; The point of putting words to paper now is to remember what a Jackson Heights boy rod was. Rod lived in Hampton Court, attended Community Methodist Church, dated girls from the Chateau -- and was pals with John Connolly. Charlie Berry, Nick Carter, Dick Garrett, Butch Speer and me, John Witek.&nbsp; Rod and I were rarely out of touch and one of the bonds that held us together was&nbsp; a mutual affection for &quot;the Heights&quot; as we called it, our dear old home town.&nbsp; How lucky we were to have been there in its golden age.

			Sorry for the loss of your friend. I also lost my friend Barbara, another old time&nbsp; Heights friend in March. So any memories of that wonderful town in that wonderful era.

			I believe he had an older brother whose claim to fame was that he consumed a 1/2 dozen martinis at the Continental (37th Ave, between 82 and 83) and walked home.
