				My usual dog watcher cannot do it. We are going on vacation in early august for around 10days. we also have cats that need to be fed but could probably have a neighbor do that. I don&#039;t think we can leave the dog alone all day and have someone come in because he needs to be around humans-the cats don&#039;t really care. We have a happy friendly fixed all shots housebroken pup. Anyone in the area that does boarding in their cage free home? I would even consider trading boarding in our home for your pet. I know there are alot of boarding places around queens but we are doing a budget vacation and the dog boarding would probably cost more than our hotel!&nbsp; So if you know anyone in the hood or you want to trade boarding please let me know thanks!

				My friend in Elmhurst sometimes boards pets in her home.&nbsp; She works for a vet in Manhattan and the vet&#039;s clients often refer my friend to one another --so she has great references.&nbsp; She already has pets at home, so the pets she boards from time to time must be able to be in an environment with her two cats and her dog.<br /><br />PM me if you would like her contact info (click on my alias &quot;Shelby2&quot; on the upper left corner of the post and you should see the option to send a message).

				I live in Jackson Heights and would be available to do any of the weekends to watch your dog and feed your cats if you need it! Thanks.

				I&#039;m terribly unhappy with my day job and am seriously thinking about doing this as my new job. Will keep you all posted and let you know by next week.
