				The recent shut down of coral aquarium, followed by the rad cat company have left us scrambling for cat food for our cats. I know there are more of you because we often went into coral to find rad cat had sold out.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found a few alternatives, mostly west coast based companies who can ship to NY but for a ridiculous sum. <br /><br />Wondering if there&#039;s an off chance 2-3 other cat owners are searching for an alternative and in the same predicament, not really ready to spend $60+ on shipping food over. <br /><br />What i&#039;m suggesting is ordering as a group (on a schedule) and splitting the shipping fee.<br /><br />Since the foods are frozen (provided you have freezer space) we could in theory order a months (or more) worth to further lessen the burden.<br /><br />Anyone?

				I was also bummed that Rad Cat closed down. <br /><br />Whiskers in Astoria and the E Village have a wide variety of raw foods, and the Astoria location delivers to JH. I&#039;ve always bought cat food from there because Coral was never reliable.

				I found a small independent pet store called Vitality &amp; Health Pets at 46-20 Broadway in Astoria. 718.440.8993&nbsp; They carry a frozen equivalent to RAD called Raw Dynamic.&nbsp; My cat loves it.&nbsp; Owner is very nice and helpful.&nbsp; They are open until 9 weekdays.&nbsp;

				https://www.chewy.com/ <br /><br />is the standard (late capitalism) answer. Doesn&#039;t address local issues - and may not have your exact brand, but does address affordable shipping.
