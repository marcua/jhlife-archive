					Thirty years ago, the JHBG first launched its Historic Jackson Heights Weekend highlighting our unique garden community.&nbsp; And over the decades people have come from far and wide (and, of course, close to home) to attend the exhibit of original photographs and ephemera, a slide presentation, the garden tour and the walking tour.&nbsp; Attendance has grown to a total of over 300 for all events over the last few years.<br /><br />Sadly, the pandemic forced the cancellation of the June 2020 and June 2021 events. However, we are preparing for a “slimmed down” version this September (only the Garden and Walking Tours). We invite you to join us.&nbsp; Tickets are $10 for each tour.<br /><br />Garden Tour: September 18th from Noon to 4pm (raindate: September 25th)<br />We anticipate 12 gardens participating this year.&nbsp; And since we have never had a fall garden tour, here is a chance to see what they look like as the summer comes to a close.&nbsp; Tickets can be purchased at Espresso 77 (35- 77th Street) beginning in early September.&nbsp; On the day of the event tickets can be purchased in front of Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets between 11am and 2pm.&nbsp; We hope to have some books and T-shirts also available for sale.<br /><br />Walking Tour: September 19th at Noon<br />Tours will meet at 11:45 in front of the Community Church, on 35th Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets).&nbsp; We ask that you reserve in advance by calling 347-766-9129 so that enough guides are available to keep each tour group to under 20 people.<br /><br />POST THE FLYER IN YOUR BUILDING!&nbsp; THANK YOU.<br />

					<span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Below you will find my commentary from my latest quarterly Jackson Heights Real Estate Report, the most authoritative assessment of current sales activity in the 11372 zip code.&nbsp; To subscribe and receive the full, three-part report, simply go to <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br /><br /><br />We now have two quarters showing the effects of the pandemic “under our belt.”&nbsp; The results, thus far, are not very surprising:<br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales volume has declined.&nbsp; Given the relatively low volume of houses sold each quarter – generally between five and fifteen, in both good times and bad – not much change was evident.&nbsp; However, the drop in sales was significant for apartments, which fell by almost two-thirds compared with the third quarter of 2019.&nbsp; The third quarter is typically when properties listed during the busy spring selling season will close.&nbsp; Being that we had almost no spring selling season, the decline was to be expected.&nbsp; Unwelcome, but expected.<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average sales price remained relatively stable.&nbsp; The main reason for this is that the vast majority of properties that closed in the third quarter (July through September) were priced and went into contract in the first quarter.&nbsp; Real estate activities, you may recall, came to a virtual halt in the second quarter (from mid-March through the end of June).<br /><br />With that said, what the future holds, remains materially uncertain.<br /><br />Five houses sold in the third quarter, down from ten a year ago, but up from three in the first quarter.&nbsp; Average sales prices fell between 5.5% and 10.5% for one-family houses.&nbsp; Two-family house prices were flat compared to 3Q2019, but rose by over 17% versus the second quarter.&nbsp; Again, low sales volume tends to magnify changes in average sales prices – especially if a particularly expensive or inexpensive property closes.&nbsp; Year-to-date, a better barometer of market conditions, sales volume declined by over 42%, to 19 houses.&nbsp; Average sales prices were down slightly for one- and three-family houses, but climbed by over 11% for two-family houses.<br /><br />Third quarter apartment sales declined in all four categories: in total by 65% compared with the year-ago quarter and by 14% compared with the second quarter.&nbsp; The sharpest decline, of just over 77% versus one year ago, was for prewar elevator cooperatives, our “bread and butter” apartment type.&nbsp; Sales results were mixed versus the second quarter.&nbsp; Compared with 3Q2019, average sales prices rose only for postwar cooperatives, advancing over 16% (this property type has always had the lowest average sales price).&nbsp; All other categories declined between 0.8% and 14.5%.&nbsp; And relative to the second quarter, sales prices rose for prewar and postwar elevator cooperatives, by 5.2% and 0.3% respectively.&nbsp; Year-to-date total apartment sales fell by 44.1%.&nbsp; Average sales prices were relatively stable for all cooperative types – ranging between (0.6%) to 5.4%, but fell by 9.2% for condominiums.<br /><br />For the fourth quarter, sales volume for houses and apartments may rise a bit, given that sales activity will have been possible for six straight months.&nbsp; Average sales prices may trend downward as inventory, especially for apartments, continues to rise, and buyers are increasingly confident that they now hold “the better hand.” <br /><br />Finally, the following paragraph, taken from my second quarter commentary, still holds true:<br /><br />It will take a few years to determine if, after a generation of renewal and success, cities – with their density, diversity, cultural attractions – continue to attract young people and start-up businesses.&nbsp; If working from home becomes more permanent, the long commute into the city will be less of a concern.&nbsp; All in all, a large number of factors will come into play which will help determine what the future will look like.&nbsp; Just as it has for the last 100 years, the quality of our housing stock, a true neighborhood feel, and convenient transportation alternatives will continue to serve Jackson Heights well.&nbsp; But given the continuing economic dislocations, the path ahead remains uncertain, not just for us, but for everyone.&nbsp; Stay tuned. <br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Please feel free to contact me with your real estate needs, and referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />78-27 37th Avenue&nbsp;

					Hello,<br /><br />I have just issued my third quarter 2014 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report.&nbsp; You can always obtain a copy of the latest report, and subscribe to future reports, by going to: <a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a brief overview of the results:<br /><br />For houses, sales were flat – for both the current quarter and year-to-date results.&nbsp; &nbsp;Average sales prices are indeed higher, as demand outstrips supply.&nbsp; Most telling are the year-to date numbers, with average sales prices up between 9% and 17% versus 2013.&nbsp; In the third quarter I sold a beautifully maintained 1920s two-family house (outside the Historic District) for $1 million (all right, it was $999,000 to escape the mansion tax).&nbsp; There were about ten offers in less than one week.&nbsp; Two three-family houses sold for similar amounts this year as well.&nbsp; However,with few comparables, appraisals can still be a problem.<br /><br />While unit sales of apartments were below the prior and year-ago quarters (again not accounting for closings in the last 10 days of the quarter), average sales prices were up across the board.&nbsp; Year-to-date unit sales were higher, a strong indicator of current market strength.&nbsp; And year to date, average sales prices were up between 5.7% (for prewar walkup coops) and 10.4% for (prewar elevator coops).&nbsp; <br /><br />The last few months saw record prices realized at a number of the original garden apartment complexes: $915,000 for a seven-room at the Towers, and $805,000 for a seven-room at the Chateau.&nbsp; A six-room at Hampton Court closed at $580,000, a five-room at Hawthorne Court at $625,000 and, finally, a six-room at Hawthorne Court for $750,000.<br /><br />With that said inventory remains very low, as are mortgage rates.&nbsp; <br /><br />[Again, the City truncated September’s results, leaving off the last ten days of the month, so the actual results for apartments are likely to be a bit higher than what is seen here.&nbsp; I will revise the third quarter numbers for the fourth quarter report.]<br /><br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />Cell: 646 285 7762<br /><br /><a href="http://www.beaudoinrealty.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.beaudoinrealty.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.jhrealestatereport.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">www.jhrealestatereport.com</a><br />
