			Why can&#039;t all our local parades be routed down the 34th Avenue Open Street now? This is going to be a traffic nightmare.

This is going to be a traffic nightmare.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />IMO parades shouldn&#039;t be on purely residential streets like 34th Ave. If they want to hold parades on commercial avenues like Northern or 37th, then 34th Ave should be open to vehicle traffic on those days.<br /><br />I do agree that there will be a traffic nightmare with both 34th and Northern closed to cars.

			Thanks for posting!&nbsp; I&#039;ll be getting the hell out of Dodge.&nbsp; Shutting down Northern and 34th avenue is just insane.
