				Well... it&#039;s NOT that I have anything against a celebration of Bolivian national pride... BUT considering how many other threads on this site complain about traffic gridlock, cars honking, lack of parking, excessive garbage and noise in our neighborhood... the last thing we need is another annual parade on 37th Avenue closing off our streets for two hours on a Sunday, IMHO. But I&#039;ll cope, as I have for the past four years I imagine.&nbsp; ::)

				i do know how you feel. see, i love this paradey, festivalish stuff. but i can see how it would get old. i am on 76th not far off the main path -- and the only parade that makes my eyes cross is the pride version (which i take part in...but when i can hear the bass from the stage on 37th road two blocks away, inside my house, gulp!). we give and take. after more than a decade here, i&#039;ve gotten used to it....

				I live on 88 th St. Park in a gargae on 87 th St. I always have a problem during parades/festivals when getting to my car and parking. I go out east on weekends to care for an elderly blind relative. I have to leave there early sunday morning to get my car back to garage. It&#039;s just inconvenient.

				I could understand how frustrating it is do deal with the noise and congestion of the parades but all of you that chose to live in Jackson Heights stay there because its a wonderful neighborhood to live in. There is no other neighborhood as diverse and full of excitement as Jackson Heights. If the festivals and parades bother you then you should try moving to East Elmhurst or College Point where it is much quieter.<br /><br />As for the Bolivian Parade, the reason it didn&#039;t show up on precinct calendars is because the people in charge of this parade were fighting for the right to have this parade up until the very end. Does anyone on this website actually think that any group could close down a major street without all the permits and licenses fully signed off on and without the full approval from One Police Plaza? There is so much more to hosting a parade then just closing down a street. If your precinct is not alerting you to all that is going on in your neighborhood then the right forum to complain about it is at a town hall meeting or at your local precinct meetings not here when the person who posted the original thread was obviously so excited that this event was taking place.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that if this was a parade that had its roots based solely on customs from the United States then this wouldn&#039;t be an issue. Instead of complaining you should have gone to watch it, our people were proud and respectful to the community. There is no other parade in the world like a Bolivian parade!&nbsp; :rockon: Viva Bolivia !!!!

				OK, well, street closures can be a sticky isue. But interesting side note: on the day of the Bolivian parade, Bolivia was becoming the first country in Latin America to hold judicial elections:<br /><br />http://aje.me/oMtKA4<br /><br />

				mr grey:<br /><br />you didn&#039;t say a racist word in this thread. overall, though, there is a lot of subtle and not so subtle racism in this forum, from &#039;why do we need another sari store&#039; to &#039;i hate tamale vendors, where&#039;s my bistro&#039; to &#039;how dare you object to trash bins being emptied in mid-sidewalk?&#039;<br /><br />not suggesting you&#039;ve gone there. but a lot of people have. we all need thicker skin, to a large degree. you immediately jumped to conclusions, just as the person you were addressing did. <br /><br />people often toss aroud the false notion that new york is a melting pot. nope. never has been. in a perfect world, it&#039;s a lovely jigsaw puzzle where unlike pieces manage to fit together to form an intriguing picture. in an imperfect world, it&#039;s a mess of stuff piled up and swept into an ugly pile. i&#039;d like to go for the former.

				I&#039;d be willing to sign a petition for noise regulations on these parades. Personally, I don&#039;t think there should be any amplified sound allowed. <br />The Dominican Parade on Northern is impossible to take a child to. Unbearable for just about everyone, i&#039;d think. <br />

				You should simply call the 115th precinct to express your concerns about the noise levels.&nbsp; Make sure the Deputy Inspector is informed.&nbsp; There are supposed to be sound/decibel limits, but they don&#039;t seem to ever be enforced.

I didn&#039;t really mean to imply that you personally were being racist. And I believe I expressed my sympathy in the beginning about how hard it is to live in an area like Jackson Heights. What I was trying to imply was that if this was a 4th of July parade or a veterans parade this might never have been an issue. However, when a group of people work for many years to reach this goal, after having been denied for so many years - its kind of hard to see people complaining that they have to deal with another parade.<br /><br />The police were actually very happy with our event, the noise level was moderate, our dancers and our people on the sidelines were polite and calm and there was very minimal clean up required after we were done. They told us that they wished more parades were as uneventful and as colorful as ours. Once again, my apologies. I love Jackson Heights, I am from Sunnyside myself.

				i only caught the tail end of the parade, but it was really vibrant and fun. in tandem with the diwali festival on 74th, it was a perfect reminder of why jackson heights is such a great place to live!
