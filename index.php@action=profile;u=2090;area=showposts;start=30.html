					Hey, I love Jackson Heights but it lacks some things I wish it had and maybe, in the coming years, it will.&nbsp; I wish it had a park-- a real park.&nbsp; Travers reminds me of an asphalt parking lot I used to hang out in when I was a kid.&nbsp; It&#039;s not my idea of a park.&nbsp; So much green space here is private.&nbsp; We need more open public green space.&nbsp; Also, A couple of Irish pubs wouldn&#039;t hurt.&nbsp; Love all the So. American chicken places, Indian restaurants, Tibet, Thai (love Chinese Saw Shack) etc but it would be nice to have a couple pubs with good burgers etc.&nbsp; And brunch with good bloody marys &amp; mimosas would be great.&nbsp; And restaurants with outdoor seating is non-existent.&nbsp; I&#039;d spend more money in the hood.&nbsp; Who would not like a few of these things here?&nbsp; Just sayin&#039;<br />

					What we do not need here are more apartments.&nbsp; We are over-developed as it is.&nbsp; Our streets are crowded.&nbsp; Our schools are over-crowded to handle the student population.&nbsp; Our services are strained.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for development but developing the spaces we already have not creating more spaces to be occupied.&nbsp; We really need more open space.&nbsp; Lower buildings (more light &amp; air) and more green space.&nbsp; My two cents.

					I love this neighborhood.&nbsp; The diversity.&nbsp; Having said that what I would like to see is a nice Irish Pub like some of the ones in Woodside.&nbsp; No, I don&#039;t want to always go to Woodside for a burger &amp; pint.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to be able to walk a few blocks and hang out in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Most of the bars in our neighborhood are not always the kind of place one would go to to just hangout for hours.&nbsp; They are either restaurants disguised as bars, or a bit pretentious (trying to be something like latin hip/pricey), or places you wouldn&#039;t (especially a woman) want to go into.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can go to Donovan&#039;s or Saints &amp; Sinners etc. Woodside and feel they are places you can relax in.&nbsp; Good unpretentious food (burgers, pot pies, fish &amp; chips etc) and a nice selection of beers and wines--and all reasonable.&nbsp; They are not trying to be slick but several steps above Ready Penny.&nbsp; I think we have the crowd here for something like this but maybe not.&nbsp; This is a heavy Hispanic neighborhood and we&#039;re seeing more Asians as well and the Veggie/family crowd so maybe this isn&#039;t the place.&nbsp; Would be nice for some of us.&nbsp; I believe that &quot;if you build it, they will come.&quot;

					Why not just refurbish the existing space?&nbsp; Or, add just one floor?&nbsp; Why the drive to add more apartments to an already congested neighborhood?&nbsp; We&#039;re suffocating here.&nbsp; We have no real parks to speak of (that asphalt thing called Travers is not a &quot;park&quot; it&#039;s an paved over chainlink fence lot.)&nbsp; We have less parks than almost anywhere in the city.&nbsp; And they want ot build more apartments?&nbsp; All this will do is continue the precedent of adding more tall buildings along 37th.&nbsp; Just look east of 82 and you an imagine all those low buildings being replaced by tall structures with more apartments.&nbsp; If there is this craven need to build tall structures at least build them on Northern.&nbsp; They could replace the car dealerships with highrises and few would care.&nbsp; But even there it would be nice if they preserve some of the older buildings.&nbsp; The whole history of JH is about open space and light.&nbsp; That&#039;s why it was orginally created.&nbsp; We can&#039;t go back but we can at least be sensible about development for the future of our neighborhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Here we go again.&nbsp; They presented their plan to the community board last year and then dropped their plans.&nbsp; They are hoping the Landmarks people are amenable to their plan now.&nbsp; They&#039;ll probably try and pitch it as affordable housing.&nbsp; Yeah, right.&nbsp; The fact that it will create another tall building along the narrow 37 Ave. seems not a concern.&nbsp; it&#039;s amazing they could even get this far with the fact that JH is a very congested neighborhood.&nbsp; We are already overbuilt.&nbsp; You walk down 37 Ave. or 82nd Street and it&#039;s like walking down 5th Ave. in Manhattan on a Saturday.&nbsp; Do we really need more apartments?&nbsp; The building next door is an eyesore.&nbsp; Looks like they got the plans from Architects R Us.&nbsp; It&#039;s Flushing coming to JH.&nbsp; You can hardly walk down Main St. Flushing.&nbsp; What ever happened to quality of life as an issue?&nbsp; If they cared about the neighborhood (and they probably don&#039;t) they could renovate the building for it&#039;s present business tenants and give them a reasonable lease.&nbsp; Patel would still make a profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					A good enough place but I wonder if the lack of diversity did it in?&nbsp; There are so many good restaurants of this type (and better) in the hood.&nbsp; A good French or Italian might have done better.&nbsp; The space is small, however, and more for take-out.&nbsp;

					Sadly, there is little live music in JH.&nbsp; As a musician I find this disappointing.&nbsp; There are one or two exceptions but it&#039;s no &quot;music scene&quot; here.&nbsp; It&#039;s ironic because there are so many musicians living in this neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen some places struggle to get something together but i guess the qudience for live music just may not be here.&nbsp;

					i agree that City Coffee on 37th has great burgers.&nbsp; Their Mexican burger is the best in the city.&nbsp; As for our new arrival--my two cents:&nbsp; Make it simple.&nbsp; Great burgers, fries, large selection of craft beers, good wine, simple menu (chili, chicken pot pies, whatever).&nbsp; Avoid the Sports Bar look, lots of wood, low noise level, make it homey/comfy.&nbsp; If you have the room a spot for local musicians might be cool.&nbsp; If you do that you&#039;ll need to watch the acoustics a bit.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp; Looking forward to a good burger/beer joint, where we can hang out for hours.&nbsp;

					I always thought this building was designed for an Asian market.&nbsp; That&#039;s the reason for the extra bathrooms.&nbsp; Probably geared towards large extended families sharing cramped quarters.&nbsp; My problem with this building, and the one designated to be constructed next to it, is the added congestion to our neighborhood.&nbsp; More cars, more people to an already crowded streetscape.&nbsp; And the developers will continue to build these large buildings along 37th Avenue.&nbsp; And there is nothing that can be done.&nbsp; Watch what goes up on the recently burned out building that housed Armando&#039;s.&nbsp;

					If these prices are correct I can&#039;t, for the life of me, figure out who would pay these prices for an apartment in this aesthetically challenged building.&nbsp; No, it&#039;s not ugly but a cookie cutter of others on the avenue and pretty bland.&nbsp; (The probably bought the plans at a Walmart.)&nbsp; If you have this kind of money you could get something much nicer in this neighborhood.&nbsp; My theory is they will probably be bought by large, extended families or, perhaps, two families might live in one apartment.&nbsp; Or it could be people who will buy the apartments and rent them out.&nbsp; It&#039;s a condo so they probably can do that.&nbsp; But maybe I&#039;m wrong.&nbsp; It&#039;ll be interesting to see what happens.&nbsp; It may be a glimpse into where the neighborhood might be headed.&nbsp;

					I agree with ECG.&nbsp; Some need to chill and end the rants.&nbsp; Whatever type of restaurant/bar they open I wish them well.&nbsp; It&#039;s a tough market and I hope they get a lot of local support.&nbsp; I remember the rants about Starbucks and it&#039;s turned out well enough and has a very diverse clientele.&nbsp; The problem is landlords (most don&#039;t live in JH) and their need to charge exorbitant rents.&nbsp; The only businesses that can pay them are chains and those funded through questionable means.&nbsp; I talk to some local business owners and many have only month to month leases.&nbsp; As for the question at hand:&nbsp; Available space -- that&#039;s a difficult one.&nbsp; The old Natural Food store is not moving anytime soon.&nbsp; They have a lease for another year and the owners will run the two stores simultaneously.&nbsp; There might be a better chance of finding some space farther past 85th to 90th.&nbsp; But I&#039;m certain they&#039;ve already looked there.&nbsp; &quot;Build it and they will come&quot; (?)&nbsp;
