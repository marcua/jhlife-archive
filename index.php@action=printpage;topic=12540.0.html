				Hello,<br /><br />I have just issued my third quarter 2014 Jackson Heights Real Estate Report.&nbsp; You can always obtain a copy of the latest report, and subscribe to future reports, by going to: www.jhrealestatereport.com&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is a brief overview of the results:<br /><br />For houses, sales were flat – for both the current quarter and year-to-date results.&nbsp; &nbsp;Average sales prices are indeed higher, as demand outstrips supply.&nbsp; Most telling are the year-to date numbers, with average sales prices up between 9% and 17% versus 2013.&nbsp; In the third quarter I sold a beautifully maintained 1920s two-family house (outside the Historic District) for $1 million (all right, it was $999,000 to escape the mansion tax).&nbsp; There were about ten offers in less than one week.&nbsp; Two three-family houses sold for similar amounts this year as well.&nbsp; However,with few comparables, appraisals can still be a problem.<br /><br />While unit sales of apartments were below the prior and year-ago quarters (again not accounting for closings in the last 10 days of the quarter), average sales prices were up across the board.&nbsp; Year-to-date unit sales were higher, a strong indicator of current market strength.&nbsp; And year to date, average sales prices were up between 5.7% (for prewar walkup coops) and 10.4% for (prewar elevator coops).&nbsp; <br /><br />The last few months saw record prices realized at a number of the original garden apartment complexes: $915,000 for a seven-room at the Towers, and $805,000 for a seven-room at the Chateau.&nbsp; A six-room at Hampton Court closed at $580,000, a five-room at Hawthorne Court at $625,000 and, finally, a six-room at Hawthorne Court for $750,000.<br /><br />With that said inventory remains very low, as are mortgage rates.&nbsp; <br /><br />[Again, the City truncated September’s results, leaving off the last ten days of the month, so the actual results for apartments are likely to be a bit higher than what is seen here.&nbsp; I will revise the third quarter numbers for the fourth quarter report.]<br /><br /><br />Please contact me should you have any real estate needs, plus referrals to friends and neighbors are always welcome.<br /><br />Daniel Karatzas<br />The Trusted Expert for Properties in Historic Jackson Heights<br />Associate Broker, Beaudoin Realty Group<br />Cell: 646 285 7762<br /><br />www.beaudoinrealty.com<br />www.jhrealestatereport.com<br />
