					i grew up in the greystones in the 80s and was always told NEVER to go into the garden. it was expressly forbidden and i longingly gazed at it whenever going down to do laundry or from my window above. one time i snuck down in a snowstorm and made snow angels, but i lived in fear of my cankanerous neighbors who would yell at me if they caught me setting a foot in their precious garden. god forbid i upset one blade of grass or anything! now that i&#039;m poor and live in a rental building in jackson heights, i have no garden to even gaze at longingly. a more well off friend lives in a building in jackson heights that just opened a roof deck!

					it&#039;s definitely corny--would like to see the jacq heights or jak heightz characters realized instead.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/realestate/05post.html?_r=5" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/realestate/05post.html?_r=5<br /></a><br /><br />INVENTIVE brokers have racked their brains for years to brand up-and-coming neighborhoods with pithy acronyms. (South Harlemâ€™s SoHa never quite caught on.) But cartoon mascots?<br /><br />Jack Heights is the star of a new neighborhood-themed comic strip by the artist David Heatley. The strip is to appear on a locally distributed map of Jackson Heights businesses. The brokerage firm MPC Properties was behind the creation of the cartoon mascot. <br />It happened, last year, in Jackson Heights, the northern Queens outpost that has enticed young couples and families with its affordable prewar apartments and access to the No. 7 train. <br /><br />Real estate watchers issued a collective groan at the introduction of Jack Heights, a stick-figured fellow consisting of the stylized letters â€˜Jâ€™ and â€˜H.â€™ <br /><br />â€œBilly Burg, meet Jack Heightsâ€ proclaimed a bus shelter placard that popped up around Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where rents are typically higher. A billboard loomed over the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, in a campaign by CG+M Advertising and Design.<br /><br />The bloggers deemed him â€œa pregnant Mr. Peanutâ€ and the whole business was quickly forgotten. <br /><br />But Michael P. Carfagna, who created the character as a vehicle for MPC Properties, his Jackson Heights-based real estate brokerage firm, was not prepared to give up on a potentially profitable spokesman.<br /><br /><em><strong>[Mod note: Similar topics merged]</strong></em>

					delhi palace has the worst service ever. i recall at least two occasions when the people i was dining with and i had to remind the wait staff multiple (like 5x) times to give us our check. they were also slow to refill our water glasses as well. i am going to stand by delhi heights for its ambience, great service, and yummy food. i haven&#039;t been to jackson diner in at least a year so i&#039;m not sure what it&#039;s like these days, but the food was always good, though not great. ambience is obviously lacking there (cafeteria style set up). i still need to get my butt to mehfil. and i&#039;ve had take out from deshi biryani, which was really flavorful. the decor from the outside looks nice and homey. i also like rice ave. for ambience and food. some might say armando&#039;s is good for ambience (if you like the sort of old world style), though i haven&#039;t been there in years because it&#039;s simply overpriced for the neighborhood. what about tibetan yak? it looks cute from the outside and i&#039;ve also heard good things about the food (if you know how and what to order). <br /><br />no, there are no super cutesy cafes or bistros here (yet?), but that&#039;s not to say we don&#039;t have a lot of good options.<br /><br />

					yay, jim leff has reared his head like putin from russia. you are an enigma because all the &quot;photos&quot; i&#039;ve ever seen of you show you from the back or wearing the chowhound mask, sort of like wilson from home improvement, if i may be allowed to make such a lousy analogy. anyway, it sounds like you are very far from nyc these days. i hope you are still hounding out good local spots wherever you are and posting them, perhaps anonymously, for all to benefit from.<br /><br />on a really unrelated note, i am more than halfway through the omnivore&#039;s dilemma, which has been a fascinating read. i will no longer view food in exactly the same light ever again. while shopping at whole foods yesterday, i was overcome with a feeling of guilt for buying &quot;industrial organic&quot; products. but it&#039;s not like it&#039;s realistic for city dwellers like me (or the rest of you on this board) to purchase produce only from farmers&#039; markets or a farm share all the time. i realize my own limitations (laziness, sometimes frugality, other times frivolity) and do the best that i can in terms of making conscious decisions about what i choose to buy and fuel myself with. as a vegetarian, i (believe i) am already doing more than the average person to combat a multitude of environmental and agricultural problems. <br /><br />

					not sure if this belongs here, but i guess it will be moved it it doesn&#039;t. anyway, i was wondering--jim leff, of chowhound fame, lives or used to live in the neighborhood. has anyone here ever met him or seen him in the flesh? he seems to be quite the enigma. i guess part of it is he doesn&#039;t want to be recognized by rabid fans (or haters). to make this more food related--maybe this has been discussed before (i&#039;m too lazy to search, ok?) but are any of you die hard arepa lady fans like jim? has she been out and about yet this spring?

					i like the fage/greek style yogurt, though it&#039;s awfully expensive. otherwise i really like the cream top brown cow brand, which is really yummy. i&#039;ve only seen this brand in manhattan, and also at the health food store on 83rd, though not recently.

					my beloved roommate is moving out in august and i&#039;ll need to reassess my living situation before then. since i don&#039;t think i can stomach living with a stranger after having such a sweet situation, i&#039;m going to look into renting a studio or 1 bedroom in the neighborhood. does anyone know roughly how much the market rate is these days? right now, i&#039;m spending $650 (roommate is paying $710, combined rent is $1360 for a 2 bedroom), and can&#039;t afford that much more, maybe up to $1000, $1100 max a month.<br />

					yeah yeah, i know they get a mention or two in the mass indian/bangladeshi/etc restaurant thread, but i don&#039;t see why mehfil gets its own thread while delhi heights doesn&#039;t. so i&#039;m rectifying matters. all the delhi heights lovers, present yourselves. i, personally, love their buffet (consistently fresh, as in they don&#039;t let the food sit for too long, and give fresh naan to each table) as well as their regular menu options. i don&#039;t love the chinese-indian palate so i don&#039;t venture to that side of the menu often, but i do love their paneer dishes. plus it&#039;s simply the classiest looking restaurant in the neighborhood, that i know of, anyway. <br /><br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; Similar threads merged.]</strong>
