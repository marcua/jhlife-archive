				I just read an interesting article in Time Magazine entitled Chicken for Breakfast (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1818200,00.html).&nbsp; Prompted by spotting a McDonalds offering a chicken sandwich for breakfast, the writer asks the question of &quot;...why we accept certain food at certain times.&quot;&nbsp; There&#039;s an accompanying video whereby he tries the sandwich at breakfast time even though his brain is craving what he considers a more traditional breakfast food such as eggs.<br /><br />As a kid in Ecuador, I remember adults eating just assorted fresh baked breads/rolls with real butter and accompanied by a cup of coffee.&nbsp; Nowadays, when family visits us in the States, they crave soups and heartier meals and sort of frown on the egg thing.&nbsp; So, what do you guys eat for breakfast?&nbsp; I&#039;m a cereal person.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s different all the time.&nbsp; At home Irish oatmeal with organic raisins or high fiber cereal, organic milk and those raisins or Greek plain yogurt.<br /><br />At work, caterers cook for us: omelettes with cheese or veggies, sometimes oatmeal, fresh fruit, fresh oj.&nbsp; <br /><br />Coffee.

				I love steel cut oatmeal as well, but am sometimes lazy and impatient about preparing it.&nbsp; There have been a few occasions when I&#039;ve gone to City Coffee Shop for breakfast and have seen people eating rice and beans.&nbsp; It looks good, but I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m ready to eat that type of meal during the breakfast hours.<br /><br />Here&#039;s another one of my little Ecuadorian stories...this one from when I was a visiting teen.&nbsp; I remember sleeping over at my aunt&#039;s house and waking up to the aroma of food being cooked.&nbsp; My morning breakfast that day consisted of tallarines de pollo (spaghetti with stewed chicken).&nbsp; It definitely was not what I perceived as a traditional breakfast in my mind, but it was absolutely delicious!&nbsp; My cousin seemed shocked that I would prefer eggs to a meal like the one I had been presented with.

				Hmm having grown up overseas I&#039;m accustomed to rather unorthodox breakfasts, though nothing beats the sheep-brain curry I was once served (for breakfast) in Pakistan. Don&#039;t think they have it on the menu here ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m fine with eating rice or noodles for breakfast, preferably spicy! Wakes you right up. One of my favorite breakfasts is paratha dipped in curry, hmm. Dimsum makes a fine breakfast too.<br /><br />Here in the States I make do with cereal or yoghurt with frozen blueberries...(also courtesy of Trader Joe&#039;s!) sometimes a soft-boiled egg or a veggie omelette...if not, there&#039;s always IHOP!

				I can&#039;t leave the house without eating--I&#039;m always amazed that so many people can just skip breakfast and run off and start their day.<br /><br />My kitchen has a shelf that looks like the one in Jerry Seinfeld&#039;s kitchen--about 10 boxes of cereal, all different varieties.&nbsp; I have a bowl every morning, with organic skim milk. Then 2 cups of coffee.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I have the cereal for dinner, too!

				i&#039;ve gotten in the habit of boiling myself an egg a good amount of mornings, but i&#039;m too lazy to do that right now....<br /><br />sometimes, when i&#039;m really lazy or running late, i&#039;ll buy a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich at one of the breakfast carts near work in harlem.&nbsp; so tasty and quite cheap... only $2.50 i believe.&nbsp; but i&#039;m not running late, and hopefully i won&#039;t be that lazy....<br /><br />so it&#039;s either corn flakes or a Thomas&#039; cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese....&nbsp; i think i&#039;ll go with the bagel.

				I used to buy breakfast once I got to work, so I&#039;d end up spending $30 a week ($6 day) just on breakfast. It was an extravagance. Now I have a boiled egg and 2 Trader Joe&#039;s toasted cinnamon crumpets. I also switched to the work coffee but I don&#039;t think it &quot;works&quot; -- yesterday I had 4 cups black &amp; still felt sleepy all day. I always have some type of tea.

				I have a healthy breakfast (oatmeal, cereal, fruit) at home six days a week but one day a week unhealthy.&nbsp; The unhealthy breakfast is at Jahns (week day special) which is usually eggs, home fries, rye toast &amp; coffee.&nbsp; They have such good home fries of course with ketcup.&nbsp; Its also nice to eat breakfast out once a week and at a bargain price.&nbsp; Somehow, its always been Jahn&#039;s but may try the others (City Coffee, Ricky&#039;s, Jackson House).&nbsp; I just heard of a breakfast club that meets every Thursday at 9AM at City Coffee.&nbsp; Anything off the menu for $5.&nbsp;

				During the week I, much like Really4Rob, live on DD coffee and horrible bagels, though I only get bagels prepared in ways I would never get at a real bagel shop- like with strawberry cream cheese. Why disappoint myself with a bad everything bagel?<br /><br />On weekends I&#039;m really big on cooking breakfast at least one day. Most weekends, one day I&#039;ll walk up to Bagel House on 90th and get bagels and coffee there or from Espresso 77 if I&#039;m not in the mood to walk so far. I like the coffee better at 77, but the bagels better at Bagel House, so really, it&#039;s a draw.<br /><br />In general I make a lot of eggs, sometimes using up leftovers, sometimes just scrambled with cheese, sometimes fried. I&#039;ve made very good home fries the past few weeks with some red potatoes from the farmer&#039;s market. When fruit is in season, I really like berry pancakes. Pancakes from scratch are some of the easiest and delicious things you can make. Once I realized it was basically as easy as a mix it&#039;s all I do. I love throwing crazy things in there too- like pumpkin puree, sour cream or ricotta cheese. Yum!

				On Saturday and Sunday I go to the Colombian bakery on 37th between 80th and 81st, south side of the street near Jahn&#039;s.&nbsp; It has the best coffee in the neighborhood and really good bread that is still warm if you go in there around 7:30 or 8:00 am.&nbsp; Get the brown bread with the raisins or the lighter bread with guava (I think) jelly inside and some white sugar on top.&nbsp; Great inexpensive food and very friendly ladies behind the counter even if you don&#039;t speak Spanish, like me.

				I&#039;ve been substituting quinoa for rice for a while now, but have come across many recipes for its use as a breakfast cereal. &nbsp;I recently found the recipe on the link below, tried it and absolutely loved it, so I thought I&#039;d share. &nbsp;Quinoa doesn&#039;t take as long as steel cut oats to cook, and another plus is that it&#039;s just as delicious.<br /><br />Warm and Nutty Cinnamon Quinoa Recipe (http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/warm-and-nutty-cinnamon-quinoa-recipe.html)
