				I am considering getting a dog and wanted to see what kind of dog boarding or dog walking services people have used before. Are there any dog boarding places and/or dog walking services in the neighborhood that you would recommend?&nbsp; I&#039;m just trying to get an idea what kind of prices to expect.<br /><br />Also, are there any corgi owners in the neighborhood? Think I may have seen one or two around recently, and wanted to chat about their experiences with a corgi in Jackson Heights<br /><br />Thank you.

				We grew up here in JH, and love dogs, cats. Unfortunately, had to put our adopted doggie “Baby”&nbsp; to sleep due to health complications.&nbsp; Huge loss for our family. It’s been a while now, but, missing her does not go away. I would consider boarding your doggie in the future if you need someone to take care of him/her.

				Dog walking will run you about $15-$20 for a half hour. I have used the Rover app, which allows you to search by location/neighborhood. I don&#039;t love the app but it has helped me find walkers, especially in a pinch. <br /><br />There is a doggy day care place in Astoria that charges $35 for a full day and $18 for a half. I have never tried it but it&#039;s called NYC Pet Services.
