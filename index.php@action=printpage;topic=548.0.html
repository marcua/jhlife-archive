				It&#039;s always interesting to read about who has roots in our neighborhood.&nbsp; The JH origins of Lucy Liu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Liu) and Don Rickles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles) have received a lot of attention.&nbsp; Some people try to blame us for Howard Stern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern), but while he was born here, I don&#039;t think he ever lived here.&nbsp; On this board, Chuckster posted an appreciation of an actress who lived in JH named Helen Kane (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=29.msg884#msg884).&nbsp; The Wikipedia entry on Jackson Heights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Heights%2C_Queens) lists other celebrities who have lived in the neighborhood.<br /><br />I bring this up because I was interested to read that Newsweek columnist and McLaughlin Group regular Eleanor Clift also grew up in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; She discusses this in an interview in tomorrow&#039;s NY Times Magazine (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/magazine/02wwln-Q4-t.html).<br /><br />Anybody know any other famous former residents of the neighborhood?<br />

				Remember Chip, the young son from the comedy Kate &amp; Allie starring Jane Curtain and Susan St. James?&nbsp; Chip was played by Frederick Koehler.&nbsp; My brother claims to have seen him many times roaming the neighborhood.<br /><br />Kevin Dobson, well known for his role on the once popular nighttime serial called Knots Landing was also a JH resident.<br /><br /><br />

				While reading Bob&#039;s post, it occurred to me that Jackson Heights has always been a hot bed for musicians and performers dating back to vaudevillian days.&nbsp; I would love to learn more on this topic.&nbsp; So far, I&#039;ve come across information stating that Benny Goodman shared an apartment in Jackson Heights along with his family.&nbsp; A while back I also discovered a vintage video of a group of musicians from the Big Bad era that also called Jackson Heights home.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, the video details the building where the band&#039;s jam sessions were held.&nbsp; Imagine that from your neighbors!&nbsp; Anyway, I can&#039;t seem to find the video now, so if anyone knows what I&#039;m talking about, please post a link!&nbsp;

				In fact, three of the greatest bandleaders of the jazz era -- Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman and Woody Herman -- were all residents of Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I can&#039;t understand why this amazing bit of information is omitted from the Wikipedia entry, as their stature dwarfs that of nearly all those listed.

				Wow!&nbsp; Great finds here - I guess we all had to do a little digging.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also found that Les Paul and Mary Ford lived in Jackson Heights in 1953 and in fact, invented the 8-track tape recorder (not the 8-track tape player) while there...<br /><br />ref: http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan07/articles/classictracks_0107.htm<br /><br /><br />Quote from web page:<br /><br />Eight-track came along a short time after &#039;How High The Moon&#039;; conceived in 1953 when Les and Mary were living in Jackson Heights, a neighbourhood of Queens, New York, and operational by 1956. Originally, he presented his idea to Westrex in LA, and after this and another company rejected it he found more receptive ears at Ampex in San Francisco.<br />&quot;We had a meeting, which was attended by everybody in the place, and they were terribly excited about it,&quot; Les recalls. &quot;They said, &#039;It can be done. It means we&#039;re going to have to develop a staff of people and go to work on this thing, but we will make you a multitrack machine.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />Which they did, developing &#039;Sel-Sync&#039; (Selective Synchronous Recording) while the resultant unit was twice flown back to San Francisco to correct problems that Les unearthed at his home in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />&quot;For one thing, they didn&#039;t have a master bias oscillator,&quot; he explains. &quot;They had eight individual oscillators controlling each track â€”there were eight tape recorders, eight sets of electronics, each self-powered with their own biasing, and of course they would conflict with each other. One master oscillator was the way to go, so we did that. Then the second error they made was to make the machine 30/60 [ips] instead of 15/30, so all the EQs were wrong, both on the recording side and on the playback side, and they therefore had to redo that. There were also two or three other minor errors that they had to correct, and after quite a while of going back and forth and debugging the system we basically changed it almost completely from what it originally was going to be.<br /><br />&quot;We built the board at the same time, we got the remotes in so that all the controls were right on there, and that board, which did everything that I wished it to do, was married to the eight-track. The board we called the Monster and the eight-track we called the Octopus. I still have that all-tube board â€” it hasn&#039;t gone to the museum yet â€” which was just about as modern as you could get, with inbuilt EQ, vibro, filters, you name it, and a great, warm, sound. People would fight for it today.<br /><br />&quot;At the same time as all that was being developed, across the hallway [in their San Francisco facility] Ampex was working on colour video picture â€” I could walk over there and talk to Ray Dolby and the guys working on the video, and then walk back to the room where we were doing the audio. Both those things would make history and change the world, but at the time I had no idea we were going to change anything. All I knew was that I had a machine with tape delay on it, the ability to change speeds and fidelity that was good. It was just a blessing.&quot;

				Our nation&#039;s next Attorney General, Eric Holder, grew up in East Elmhurst.<br /><br />The New York Times<br />High Achiever Poised to Scale New Heights (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/nyregion/01holder.html)<br />By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ<br />Published: November 30, 2008<br /><br />Nine-year-old Eric Holder sat in the basement of his familyâ€™s house in Queens, enraptured by the inaugural words of the fresh-faced president from Massachusetts. The broadcast on the tiny television set faded in and out, muffled by the steady roar of jetliners at nearby La Guardia Airport, but John F. Kennedyâ€™s call for hope and change was enough to stir the boyâ€™s desire to serve.<br />&nbsp;<br />By ninth grade, Ricky, as he was known to his friends, was standing before his peers in the auditorium making his case for student body president. In high school, towering above his classmates and teachers at 6 feet 3 inches tall, he passionately debated how to rid African-Americans of their second-class status.<br /><br />Now, four decades later, Eric Himpton Holder Jr., 57, the Bronx-born son of Miriam, an Episcopal church secretary from New Jersey, and Eric Sr., a real estate broker from Barbados, is expected to be nominated on Monday by President-elect Barack Obama to become the attorney general of the United States. He would be the first black person to do so.<br /><br />â€œI didnâ€™t have any idea what I would be when I grew up,â€ Mr. Holder said in an interview last week, his first public comments since reports of his selection emerged in November. Attorney general, he added, was â€œnot on the radar.â€<br /><br />Growing up in East Elmhurst, Queens, Mr. Holder lived in two worlds. There was the neighborhood kid, a basketball addict who drew smiles from girls and once cut class to watch the Mets. Then there was the overachiever, a history scholar who buried himself in books and newspapers and was plucked from his local public elementary school to attend a program for gifted students at another school.<br /><br /><em>(Follow link for complete article)</em>

				One of the academic stars at JHS 145&nbsp; back in the 50&#039;s was Nikki Yerby who was the daughter of Frank Yerby. I am not sure if his work is read very much anymore but he wrote about the antebellum days of plantations and slavery but without any of the racial stereotyping of other authors. He was the first African-American author to be generally popular as far as I know. His Wikipedia entry says he left America in 1955 to live for the rest of his life in Spain. Presumably that&#039;s when his daughter left the school and the country. The film &quot;the Foxes of Harrow&quot; was I think the only one his novels made into a movie.<br /><br />The Oscar winning composer Red Evans whose list of hits is endless(Silver Bells,Mona Lisa,Too Young, Que Sera Sera,etc,etc.) lived on on 73rd Street and his son Tommy was someone I knew. They were certainly around for a good part of the 50s however I am not sure how long they stayed beyond 1956<br />.<br />The fighter Tony Canzoneri lived in JH and I remember seeing him walking to the subway. He was a very well known fighter in the thirties and also beat Marlon Brando up in the finale of On the Waterfront. <br /><br />The rest of my recollections might be flawed and certainly you would have to be&nbsp; on Medicare to remember some of these names. Dorothy Collins and Raymond Scott of Your Hit parade I think lived in JH<br /><br />Dr Harry Cagney.Jimmy&#039;s brother,had a practise in JH and I think lived here as well (not sure of that).<br /><br />This might be something I dreamed up but I recollect that Whitey Ford lived on 71st Street and 35th for a brief time. I think Mel Allen lived in JH as well briefly but that might be apocryphal.<br /><br />The principal of PS 69 when I went there was Mr. Jaffe whose daughter was Rona Jaffe who wrote romantic novels in the 50s one of which was made into a film(The Best of Everything) <br />&nbsp;<br />Helen Kane who someone else mentioned lived in the Berkeley on 35th Avenue. She had retired many years ago but was remembered as the inspiration for Betty Boop she being the original Boop a doop girl. She even appeared in a film with Cary Grant. I remember seeing her occasionally with her husband . She died in JH where she had lived for many years.<br />I am not sure if all of these names qualify as famous but they added something to the interesting history this community has had

				Just a slight correction to the Whitey Ford reference. It was 71st and 37th where I believe he lived. The reason I think he lived there was that I like a lot of other Jackson Heights kids went trick or treating in those dear old innocent days and rumor had it that Whitey lived there. My love for the Yankees is limitless so either I knocked on the Ford household door and was met by a little girl who shouted &quot;Whitey there&#039;s another one&quot; or it was all a Yankee-inspired dream that remains in the never-never land of truth and fiction.<br /><br />What is absolutely true is that I shook Yogi Berra&#039;s hand when he opened his diner called the Dugout on the corner of 74th Street and 37th Avenue(now a sort of bedraggled pizza joint) back in the 50&#039;s.I was one of the 100s of kids who surrounded Yogi as he got out of black limo to make a dash into his place which I don&#039;t think lasted very long. In those days most of the kids I knew were Giants&#039; fans as presumably were their parents.

				<br /><br />Thank you Citizen for confirming an ancient recollection to be true. Did the the Ebay photo give the address? Having the Whitey Ford connection to JH proved I am feeling more confident that my locating him on 71st Street was correct. In those days living on 72nd Street as I did, I really wasn&#039;t allowed to wander very much further than 74th Street on the upside and the&quot; lots &quot;(open fields just beyond what is now Legends bar) to 37th Ave. I was probably only 7 or 8 back in those Whitey days.<br /><br />So 71st is what I remember and I am sticking with it.

				Jackson Heights has had a number of residents whose celebrity we can all take pride in even if their time in our community was fleeting. The first is Orson Welles who in his early years in New York was involved in theatre both as a director and performer. In the book Young Orson by Patrick McGilligan there is a brief mention of him living in Jackson Heights. The book doesn&#039;t say where and if there are any known details it would be very useful to add that to the historical record of previous JH residents.<br /><br />The other is the infamous Fritz Kuhn who was the head of the German-American Bund, a Nazi front organization that was once strong enough to hold a rally in Madison Square Garden where some twenty thousand brown shirted followers attended. Kuhn was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement(he was a crook as well as being a fascist) and then deported to Germany where he died unmourned and unknown. He lived in Jackson Heights where his residence had a police guard.The newspaper archives always described him as living in Jackson Heights so he wasn&#039;t just a visitor in the community. Does anyone know where this infamous artifact of the 30&#039;s lived?<br />

				<br />One mystery solved-and many thanks for that. Would it be fair to ask if he lived in a house or an apartment? I wonder if the current residents know that Kuhn lived there? Apparently even after his citizenship was revoked,served time in jail, and deported back to Germany he still wanted to come back-such is the magnetic pull of Jackson Heights. Perhaps his shade in full brown shirt uniform&nbsp; walks in the still of the night up and down 73rd street(note to all-this is not an encouragement to revive Fritz Kuhn in the annual JH Halloween parade)<br /><br />And now on to the great and maybe the greatest former resident of Jackson Heights-Orson Welles. Could it be that Welles and Kuhn had breakfast at Jahns at the same time. Or eyed each other from a safe distance on the platform waiting for the F train? Who knows or as Welles might have said when he was playing The Shadow on the radio- &quot;the Shadow knows&quot;

				She had 8 siblings and moved to NJ as a kid because they outgrew their apartment. Here&#039;s what she said about JH (not sure if it means the building is gone?):<br /><br />Susan Sarandon: When I was doing Romance &amp; Cigarettes with John Turturro, I went back, called my mom, and asked, “What was the exact address of our apartment building?” Of course that lot was gone. I used to love to ride the train with my mom — I remember thinking the subway was really cool.
