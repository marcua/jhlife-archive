				Does it have to be fried to be good?&nbsp; Yes I&#039;m afraid so.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I like the greek salad at Jackson House. Also if you just get the rotisserie chicken at any of the numerous places and have a salad with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Indian restaurants must also have some good options with all the lentil and veggie dishes.<br /><br />If you venture into Sunnyside, Turkish Grill, on Queens Blvd. 43/42 street has options. The #32 bus stops almost in front of it. They have several salads, lots of eggplant dishes and 2 yogurt spreads that are tasty. The hummus is good as well. The chicken kebab is good too.

				I don&#039;t like fried food that much.&nbsp; I eat french fries maybe half a dozen times a year. I prefer my food grilled.&nbsp; But I&#039;m not opposed to fried foods if they&#039;re really tasty and not just greasy.&nbsp; Last time my cholesterol shot up I ate oatmeal every morning and got it back down to normal numbers.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t have a genetic predisposition so I guess I&#039;m lucky.&nbsp; I definitely want to try UFC before I knuckle down and eat right again.&nbsp; I figure I&#039;m on a roll what with the burgers and fries this week.

				Afghan Kebab House on 37th Ave. around 74th St. is a good restaurant without a lot of fried stuff.&nbsp; At least what I&#039;ve had hasn&#039;t been fried.&nbsp; Any of the Thai places are pretty good in that regard too.&nbsp;

				I have to avoid fried food for medical reasons (though sometimes I slip up...). I still find it fairly easy to eat in our neighborhood. The chicken at Pio Pio (and most of the other places that serve whole chickens) are rotisserie and not fried. Civiche is very good and very good for you, and available in gigantic portions at Inti Raymi. Lots of places that serve calamari give the option of grilled instead of fried. And it may not be great for your cholesterol, but steak (mostly) isn&#039;t fried- and is delicious!

				So ECG, I had the fried drumsticks at UFC last nite.&nbsp; And even though they were good, fried food is still not my fave.&nbsp; They weren&#039;t good enough to change my mind.<br /><br />Final answer: does it have to be fried to be good? No.

				Thanks, all. No surprise I guess that chicken and seafood and vegetarian foods are better for you. <br /><br /><br />Now, another question for another thread perhaps.<br /><br />What do you think a &#039;reasonable dinner&#039; should cost? Minus alcohol because almost all drinks are similar in cost? And how much do you factor in ambience into the reasonableness?<br /><br />

				I saw this discussion about Jade Bamboo at 7024 35th Ave in JH on chowhound - maybe it would be healthy and tasty enough for you? (though who knows how healthy it really is. . .)<br /><br />&quot;Jade has a lunch special everyday until 5PM instead of 3PM. I go close to 5PM and bring back for dinner an entree + soup which includes hot &amp; sour for just $5 no tax and they have 40 choices. They also have an <strong>excellent Special Health Diet</strong> which includes 11 items such as Scalllops &amp; Jumbo Shrimp with vegetables &amp; brown rice for $5.75 served all day. They have 7 special Steamed Dishes for just $5 &amp; Cantonese Style Soup for under $5 served all day.&quot;<br /><br />http://www.chowhound.com/topics/508523

				ECG, also factor in pasta vs. steak.&nbsp; A bowl of pasta with a salad at my favorite mom pop Italian restaurant is under $20.&nbsp; A steak with one side a is about $24 and up.&nbsp; I usually spend closer to $35 dollars for dinner since I like appetizers, veggies with my meal.&nbsp; And I&#039;ll always spend more for ambiance.&nbsp;

				Should we make this a separate topic?<br /><br />I really like to go to Novo on Mondays for the jazz, sitting in a comfy chair, and having Currasco (SP!), veggies and sometimes a side of potatoes&nbsp; for under $20. I totally enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.
