				Does anyone notice the increasing number of male teenagers hanging out on the playground in Travers Park in the late afternoon? My concern is that these young men are running around and chasing each other where our babies and toddlers are also walking slowly and learning to walk.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometimes, these teenagers are seen jumping over fences, opening doors, and failing to close the metal gates after they exit.&nbsp; It is dangerous to have open doors, since it will allow our kids to run out.&nbsp; The fast running also means that kids are pushed around by their frantic running.&nbsp; Any opinions on this?

				Talk to one of them. They are teenagers, so I&#039;m not really surprised they&#039;d be horsing around in a playground or not mindful that what they are doing isn&#039;t the greatest for little kids. If no adults tell them to take their horseplay to an area without little kids, they won&#039;t get the message.

				&nbsp;Agreed, talking to them is the best idea. They are still young people and if things are this crazy when we <br />have asphalt at Travers, think of the madness when people are trying to keep them off the grass/mud hill.<br /><br />&nbsp;We need more help at Travers from Parks, NYPD and us, the community, to make sure it is a safe space<br />for all. Your little ones will be teens one day too and you will want adults to treat them respectfully and<br />give them a chance to alter their behavior if needed. I was able to ask them to move away from the <br />exercising seniors when I saw it was an issue and they did comply when it was explained.

				Yes and it&#039;s annoying!.&nbsp; They act like wild animals.&nbsp; I remember about two years ago they were ready to lite a joint right there in the early afternoon.&nbsp; I told them to get the eff out.

				Awesome advice Captain Flannel! I work with teenagers all day, and their behaviors. It disappoints me sometimes when I see problems that could be prevented by simple communication. Teenagers totally CAN be intimidating, but at the same time adults might generally be surprised by how they can change their behavior when they are reminded that they are sharing a space with others that could be their own sisters, mothers and other relatives. If people never say anything, the message is sent that what they are doing is acceptable. Of course everyone should take care of their own personal safety, but in general, a request to move is not met with blades and violence. If no one teaches them, how can they know?

				Well, talk to them is not always problem solver. Few women tried to talk to them with no results. <br /><br />Also, I see many caregivers leave the gates open, it&#039;s&nbsp; annoying!

				Nothing is &quot;always&quot; a problem solver. If the choice is something that &quot;always&quot; works or nothing and complaining about it on a board that I sincerely doubt is a hub for Jackson Height&#039;s teens, I think talking to teenagers is more likely to lead the outcomes parents and caregivers of small children want, don&#039;t you?<br /><br />Teenagers aren&#039;t monsters. Many of them have younger siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews. What teenagers often are though is caught up in their own fun and goofing around and not thinking through the consequences of their actions. That&#039;s kind of a hallmark of being a teenager. Talking to them, and getting a bit stern if necessary, is unlikely to be a negative.

				In my own experience, I&#039;ve found that teen boys respond better than teen girls. I&#039;m not sure how my gender plays in to the reaction though. <br /><br />I recently had the misfortune of being on the 7 train right after school let out, and predictably a group of loud teenagers, mostly boys, got on at 33rd St. They were just acting like typical teens -- speaking loudly to one another, yelling and joking with one another with mild insults being thrown back and forth between groups. At least they weren&#039;t cursing non-stop. After a couple stops, and one of them sitting next to me and speaking with a really, really loud, resonant voice, I just told them loud enough for the whole group to hear that no one else on the train found their conversation interesting and I pointed out to the guy next to me that he had a pretty loud voice and could take it down a couple of notches indoors.&nbsp; There was a bit of mild resistance &quot;that&#039;s just my voice,&quot; but you know what? They quieted down considerably.<br /><br />Teens make me cringe, because I&#039;m pretty sure I was just awful at their age. I think about school trips on buses, and I look back with deep sympathy for those poor bus drivers
