				I didn&#039;t even know there was a gallery over there, or really anywhere in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;m so wrung out at the end of the day that I don&#039;t look around to see what&#039;s in my own backyard so to speak.&nbsp; Unfortunately can&#039;t make it over there tonight but if there is some kind of website or mailing list I&#039;d like to know about it. Thanks.

				The gallery&#039;s website is http://www.ygallerynewyork.com/ and they do have an email mailing list you can get on so that you will know about future events.<br /><br />They are also open regular hours, and if you don&#039;t have to work on weekends you could walk over there on a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; Maybe you could combine it with a trip to Despana Brand Foods a few doors down for some gourmet Spanish food products and a free glass of wine.<br /><br />http://nymag.com/listings/stores/despana_brand_foods/

				From the Y Gallery:<br /><br />Dear friends,<br />&nbsp; <br />Come and join us for Jim Avignon&#039;s delightful performance art on January 25th, 2007 from 6-9pm<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Y&nbsp; Gallery is pleased to present â€œi looked in the mirror and i saw a ghost,â€ an exhibition of paintings, furniture and murals by German Pop artist Jim Avignon. In this exhibition, Avignon has chosen to work with the idea of multiple lives in a fictional world that is threatening to become a â€œreality.â€ <br /><br /><br /><br />Curator Cecilia Jurado says,&nbsp; â€œI am fascinated by the amount of time people devote to creating other identities online. Jimâ€™s work addresses this in a playful and sharp commentary.â€<br /><br /><br /><br />Jim Avignon is known for his sense of humor, for instance here he introduces ghosts as the main characters in various quotidian life situations. <br /><br /><br /><br />We believe this exhibition is pertinent to the context and diversity of Jackson Heights. Individuals from all over the globe coexist in this community where they have few things in common. Integrating into American culture often leads to reassessing oneâ€™s self and native culture. This may stimulate individuals to re-evaluate their innate identities, which many artists believe are the results of cultural clashes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Avignon introduces the general public to art collecting by having his exhibition pieces priced under 200 dollars. He declares it an act of democratic art distribution. <br /><br /><br /><br />Jim Avignon was born in Munich, Germany. His work has been showcased at Documenta, Kassel; Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona; Museum of Modern Art, in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland, as well as in many galleries around the world. There are also numerous television documentaries about Avignon broadcast on BBC, Arte and DWTV and the 60-minute documentary â€œdie welt des Jim Avignonâ€œ. He currently lives and works in New York and Berlin.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />32-70 85th Street (corner with Northern Boulevard) <br />Jackson Heights- Queens, New York 11370-2012 <br />&nbsp; <br />718.565.6285 <br />info@ygallerynewyork.com <br />www.ygallerynewyork.com <br />&nbsp; <br />Gallery Hours: Tuesday thru Saturday 12 - 7 pm <br />&nbsp; <br />By Train: 7 train to 82nd St. - Roosevelt Ave. F, E, V, R, G trains to 74th St. Roosevelt Ave. then take the bus Q33 to Northern Boulevard.

				I went to this performance and it was fun watching the artist work, but the best part was seeing what he&#039;s done with the space for the duration of the show.&nbsp; He&#039;s really turned the gallery into an environment.&nbsp; Check it out if you have a chance.&nbsp; Even if you can only walk by when the gallery is closed, you should still be able to get a sense of the show from the sidewalk since the outside wall is entirely glass.

				I bought a piece by Paul Dacey about 3 years ago. His work is original, complex and every day when I see it on the living room wall, I&#039;m glad I made the purchase!<br /><br />No, I have no stake in the Y Gallery or any other promotional subtext.

				From Artcal (http://www.artcal.net/event/view/14/7899)...<br /><br />Artemio, <em>13</em><br />Y Gallery<br />32-70 85th Street, Jackson Heights, 718-565-6285<br />September 13 - October 11, 2008 <br /><br />Y Gallery is pleased to present 13, the first solo exhibition in New York by Artemio curated by Cecilia Jurado. For this exhibition Artemio has chosen to confront our massive industrial production of weapons, their intromission into our daily lives and the subtle effects this has on our minds. He combines the aesthetic qualities of mosaics and mandalas with the easy, desirable shape of guns, creating attractive pieces that remind us how quickly we can digest anything if it is nicely presented.<br /><br />War and violence are themes Artemio has addressed from early in his career. The concept for this particular exhibition was born as he flipped through a magazine devoted to guns and weapons. At the time Artemio was fascinated with fractals and mandalas and the spiritual aspect of their traditions. He decided to create his own using images of weapons. At first, they were intended as stencils for street graffiti though over time, they evolved into photographic impressions on canvas. In addition, Artemio presents carpet and flooring influenced by Spanish and Arabic geometric figures as well as spaces reflecting our seemingly appetite for destruction.<br /><br />The presentation of this new series coincides with this moment in New York and the U.S. where people are considering what has happened in the past in order to decide the best way to go in the future.<br /><br />Artemio was born in Mexico City in 1976. He has shown internationally in galleries and museums such Museo de Arte ContemporÃ¡neo Carrillo Gil, CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art San Francisco, MUSAC Museo de Castilla y Leon, CECCH Centre dâ€™edition Contemporaine Geneve, Musee d Art Contemporain de Lyon, Hayward Gallery in London among others. He had participated in Sexta Bienal de Video y Nuevos Medios and in the 1st Torino Triennial. Artemio lives and works in Mexico City.<br /><br />This project is possible thanks to the generous support of The Mexican Cultural Institute of New York.

				Title: <strong>18 Beats: Sonic Survey Along the 7 Train</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>toddg</strong> on <strong>January 12, 2009, 12:04:49 AM</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				From the press release...<br /><br />Hector Canonge<br />18 BEATS<br />Sonic Survey Along The 7 Train<br />January 3-24, 2009<br /><br />(http://www.ygallerynewyork.com/images/ehib09jan.jpg)<br /><br />Y Gallery is pleased to present &quot;18 BEATS&quot;, a interactive exhibition by New York based artist Hector Canonge.<br />For the past few years, Canonge has been investigating connections between the public sphere and art practice in different cultures through the integration of technology, research and field work. For this exhibition, he uses touch screen -URBIS18- and commercial scanning technology -IRTag- to explore sonic perception in relation to various ethnic communities along the #7 Train line in Queens, New York. The artist studied the borough&#039;s diverse cultures, traditions and ethnic heritage as well as its history to present audio imprints (sound recordings and reproductions) and archival graphic material (maps and photo documentation).<br /><br />Through two interactive environments and a site specific installation, 18 BEATS serves as an audio/visual experience that not only gives us a wider approach to specific locations along the 18 stops the #7 Train makes in Queens, but also makes us aware how much investigation and art practice can reveal in the common, daily behaviors that are important in understanding the differences in ourselves. In a world full of messages with visual impact, Hector Canonge&#039;s sound projects narrate the embedded wealth of information in a fragment of music, a piece of dialogue, or a bit of sound captured in the streets.<br /><br />Hector Canonge studied literature, film and Integrated Media Arts. His work has been exhibited at the Jersey City Museum, Bronx Museum of The Arts, Queens Museum of Art. He was commissioned in 2008 to make a public project for the Corona Plaza Center. His film and documentary work has been presented and won several awards in festivals around the world; Il Mercosul Biennial, Brazil; The Museum of Modern Art, Dominican Republic; Mix Festival, Mexico City; Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, Turin, Italy; and Kino Im Schwulz, Cologne, Germany; among many others. Hector Canonge lives and works in New York City.<br /><br />This project is made possible in part with funds from the Decentralization Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts, administered by the Queens Council on the Arts, and private donations.

			</dt>
			<dd class="postbody">
				<em>From the Press Release...</em><br /><br />Blanka Amezkua / Eunah Kim<br />TWO TO DOMINATE<br />curated by Cecilia Jurado<br />&nbsp;<br />Opening Reception: January 31st, 6 - 9 pm<br />January 31st - February 28th<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Y Gallery is pleased to present &quot;TWO TO DOMINATE&quot;, a two person exhibition by Mexican artist Blanka Amezkua and Korean artist Eunah Kim curated by Cecilia Jurado. For this exhibition both artists address ideas of powerful women, women with extraordinary physical attributes. Amezkua goes for the stereotypically hip, ultra sexy and dramatic woman,&nbsp; Kim has chosen to showcase the happy healthy one.<br /><br />Since her early work, Eunah Kim has focused on the ambivalence of medicine, the need for cure for the body and the experimentation in the will to get more knowledge about our unseen interiors. Also, she has investigated death and spiritual acts around it. Last year, the artist was diagnosed with lung cancer, a fact that changed her work dramatically. She thought her deep research had coincided with her real life, as dark as this can sound. For her new project she wanted to produce as many vibrant and lively works as she could to keep herself in good health. Thus she produced a group of exquisite objects with human organs representing what looks like a sect of healthy superwomen. Flags, medallions, a beauty queen with happy lungs and more. Like an equation, health=happiness, success.<br /><br />In her way, Blanka Amezkua has being reusing mass media imagery from her native Mexico. For some of her work she takes representations of women in erotic comic books, usually produced for a male audience, and replaces them with objects that are more related with to domestic, housewife activities such as embroidering and collecting baroquely framed family portraits.&nbsp; This time she presents a group of manipulated comic covers with sexy women in tragic scenes, where the drama gives even more sex appeal to the protagonists. Also the artist presents a big collection of women&#039;s breasts from comics, delicately sewn onto one another emphasizing the well known devotion to them.<br /><br />Born in Mexico City and now based in New York City, Amezkua originally trained as a painter, studying in Florence, Italy and receiving her BA from California State University in Fresno. She has shown in numerous galleries, museums and biennials in the United States and Mexico including The Bronx Museum of the Arts, El Museo del Barrio, Queens Museum of Art, Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, and Movimiento de Arte y Cultura Latino Americana (MACLA). She runs the project space Bronx Blue Bedroom.<br /><br />Eunah Kim is a&nbsp; graduate from Rhode Island School of Design and was awarded with the emerging artist grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Her inventive work has been shown across the United States and Europe. She lives and works in Cambridge.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Y Gallery<br />www.ygallerynewyork.com<br />info@ygallerynewyork.com / 718-565-6285<br />32-70 85th Street at Northern Blvd Jackson Heights, Queens, NY 11370<br />F,E,V,R trains to 74th St.-Roosevelt Ave and 7 train to 82nd St.-Roosevelt Ave

Catya Plate creates a new mythology that responds to our angst-ridden times. In this adventure she mixes diverse cultures in a seriocomic way that could be read in many different layers as her multiple characters and stories are presented to the spectator.<br /><br />The artist returns to the modern discourse where the possibility of an emancipatory new world can be the only hope. Like Aldous Huxley, Plate structures her universe with clones of an ideal that will work more productively and live freely. The paradoxical and naÃ¯ve, work was entirely handmade by the artist.<br /><br />Catya Plate was born in Barcelona, Spain and grew up in KÃ¶ln, Germany. She came to New York through a Fulbright Scholarship in 1987. Her work has been included in exhibitions at The Bronx Museum, Islip Art Museum, Hunterdon Museum of Art and Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria. Her solo shows include the Robert V. Fullerton Art Museum, Art Resources Transfer and Galerie Elten &amp; Elten in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. Her art is held in numerous private and public collections including The Brooklyn Museum, The Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library and Museo dei Tarocchi, Bologna, Italy.<br /><br /><br /><br />

In Spanish, â€œEl Finâ€ means â€œThe Endâ€ but it is also the â€œthe focal point of an idea, its planned consequenceâ€ when one is determined to take something far away from its point of origin to its furthest limit.<br /><br />Christoph Draeger has been working rigorously for years with different aspects of catastrophe: building mockups of destroyed towns, staging moments of terror, and focusing on locations of real disasters such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Tlatelolco. For &quot;El Fin&quot;, using installation, photography and film stills, Draeger brings to Y Gallery a new group of work that emphasizes his strong sense of irony and sensibility to present lifeâ€™s darkness in a more poetical form. Draeger leads us to &quot;the end&quot; through death and loss of communication.<br /><br />Miguel Aguirre, a Peruvian artist working in Barcelona, has been using the modality of painting throughout his career. Having begun with large scale canvases and now, for â€œEl Finâ€, using miniature paintings, Aguirre has shown an amazing control over the medium, making everything he paints look incredibly beautiful. For the last 3 years, Aguirre has addressed episodes of terror in our history through various mass media representations (TV, cinema, newspapers). Focusing on iconic images of powerful characters involved in wars and massacres, Aguirre presents a new set of paintings based directly on international news items such as the portrait of the recently rescued Ingrid Betancourt and a faux heroic homage to Chilean Army General Pinochet.<br /><br />While Draeger digs into our own graveside fears, Aguirre examines the faces of power in Goyaesque grandiosity. Both artists effectively layer the double meanings of chance and intention of â€œEl Fin.â€<br /><br />Christoph Draegerâ€™s work has been featured in many solo exhibitions, including shows at The Kitchen, the PaÃ§o das Artes SÃ£o Paulo, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as in group exhibitions at P.S.1, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and at KunstWerke, Berlin, among other venues. He is a regular participant in international festivals and biennials in cities such as KwangJu, Havana, Valencia, Turin, and Liverpool, among others. The Centre Pompidou, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Centre pour lâ€™image Contemporaine are among the public collections that house his work. He lives and works in New York.<br /><br />Miguel Aguirre Vega has been shown internationally, having solo shows in Spain, Switzerland, Chile, Ecuador and Peru. He has participated in the 3rd Mercosur Biennial (Brazil), Bienal de Arte de Valls (Museu de Valls), Popular / Pop (vanguardia, conflicto &amp; modernidad visual) and TrÃ¡nsito de imÃ¡genes (MALI, Museo de Arte de Lima), Boda (MEIAC. Badajoz) among others. He lives and works in Barcelona.<br /><br /><br />Y Gallery<br />www.ygallerynewyork.com<br />info@ygallerynewyork.com / 718-565-6285<br />32-70 85th Street at Northern Blvd Jackson Heights, Queens, NY 11370<br />F,E,V,R trains to 74th St.-Roosevelt Ave and 7 train to 82nd St.-Roosevelt Ave<br />

Each photo is accompanied by short text with the workerâ€™s name, hometown, number of years working in New York, and amount of money they send to their families each week. Like the â€œSuperheroes,â€ the NICE community and membership is made up of new and largely overworked Latino immigrants who work in often precarious conditions to help support families back home. Dulceâ€™s artwork aims to â€œreintroduce the Latino immigrant in New York in a satirical documentary style featuring ordinary men and women in their work environment donning superhero garb, raising questions of both our definition of heroism and our ignorance of and indifference to the workforce that fuels our ever-consuming economy.â€<br /><br />Dulce Pinzon will be generously donating all proceeds of the calendar sales to NICE (non-profit organization that works to ensure that new immigrants can build social, political and economic power in their communities and beyond)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Y Gallery<br />www.ygallerynewyork.com<br />info@ygallerynewyork.com / 917 721 4539
