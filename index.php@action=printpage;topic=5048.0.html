				I have a fading memory of a store that used to occupy the west side (facing Met Food, on the right side)of the then SHOP WISE supermarket..about a quarter of the present length. I remember a Big Wheel trike hanging in the window that I always wanted. Does anyone remember the name of that store?

				I lived in JH from 1944 until 1980. My first memories of that block was on the corner of 77th and 37th was a small diner called the Toddle House, then came Shop Right&nbsp; ( which was called &quot;Save-on&quot; back then) and then the Public Linrary until the one was built on 81st Street in 1953.&nbsp; Hope this helps

				That&#039;s it then Rob, <strong>must</strong> have been a pharmacy. Probably had a few toys in the window to make peace with the kids. Now I wonder if anyone knows the name of that pharmacy?<br /><br />Oh yeah remember that KFC. Can&#039;t believe my dad would send me there to buy him his pack of Tarrytons (sp?) - they had one of those coffin nail machines there.<br /><br />Would have enjoyed that Library Kestral!

If memory serves, I believe it was moved by Gerosa Heavy Hauling.
