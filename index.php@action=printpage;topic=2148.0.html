				For me the hardest part of winter is when the holidays pass and it is bitterly cold and dark.&nbsp; My first sign of Spring is when the days start to get longer.&nbsp; We are now gaining about 8-9 minutes of daylight every week in the evening (the morning daylight change is slower this time of year).&nbsp; I think I hate the darkness of winter more than anything else.&nbsp; I actually like snow while it is falling but hate it afterwards because of the parking headaches it causes and the sloppiness of melting dirty snow. <br /><br />Do you realize that the sun sets tomorrow at 5:00 PM which is 32 minutes later than when it set at 4:28 PM on December 14th and that on February 28th the sun will set at 5:45!&nbsp; Spring is coming!&nbsp; To me the glass is always half full!

				For me it is a very distinct scent in the air.&nbsp; It is difficult to describe.&nbsp; Usually there will be a day in early March when it first appears.&nbsp; There is a freshness about it.&nbsp; That is when I know Spring is not far away.

				The first poking through the ground of the daffodil greens.&nbsp; I worry about them every year because they always seem to come up when it&#039;s still way too cold out.&nbsp; I guess they have their own wisdom about things though, like most natural things.
