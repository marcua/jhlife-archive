Whole-heartedly. One of my favorites so far this year. some of those great, off-the-wall Neil solos, great songs, and Nils Lofgren fits in perfectly.

			This is so cool! Some good artists I didn&#039;t know about.<br />And yeah, had he stopped me I probably wouldn&#039;t have made the cut, because chances are I would&#039;ve been listening to Hall &amp; Oates.

I&#039;m a musician by passion and profession. And even though I&#039;m not so familiar with Young&#039;s huge catalog, I checked this album out and fell in love.
