				<strong>Jackson Heights Life Photo Contest #4- Spring 2010</strong><br /><br />Welcome to the Fourth Jackson Heights Life Photo Contest! &nbsp;We are looking for an excellent photograph to use on the banner of our website. &nbsp;Here are the rules for our contest:<br /><br />1. Three submissions per person only - show us your best work.<br />2. Images should be in digital format, taken with at LEAST a 3mp camera. Scanned images must be HIGH quality.<br />3. Photos should not portray identifiable individuals.<br />4. Photos should have a horizonal composition to look good as a banner, which is approximately 5 times as wide as it is tall.<br />5. A small version of the image should be posted or linked to this thread with a brief title or description.<br />6. The contest starts immediately and will run until April 30, 2010. At that time the contest will be closed to new entries.<br />7. After the submission period is closed, the JHLife community will vote on the submitted images.<br />8. In mid-May, a winner will be announced and the graphics will go live on the homepage shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Further details:<br />By your submission, you are giving us permission to use your image on the Jackson Heights Life homepage. &nbsp; <br /><br />If selected, your image will run for several months. &nbsp;It should be a picture that captures some aspect of Jackson Heights... photos that capture a sense of the season are especially welcome. &nbsp;<br /><br />There is no need to crop your photo before posting it for this contest. &nbsp;If your photo is selected, we will work with you to turn the photo into an appropriate banner. &nbsp;We will put your name, username or email on the bottom of the banner so people can contact you.<br /><br />FYI, there are two ways to post photos on this site. &nbsp;The first way is to upload them to another site, like Flickr or Photobucket, and link to the image from here. &nbsp;An explanation of how to do this is over here (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=374.msg1700#msg1700).<br /><br />The second way is to attach a file directly to your post. &nbsp;At the bottom of the page, click on &quot;Additional Options,&quot; and then enter the filename in the box next to &quot;Attach:&quot;. &nbsp;Files must be smaller than 128 kB.<br /><br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br /><em>signed,<br />Moderators shelby2 and chuckster<br />and Calendar Editor toddg</em><br /><br />P.S. Thanks to LillithdeSade for the excellent photo we have been using for the past several months.<br /><br />P.P.S. For a trip down memory lane, here are the past winners:<br /><br />Photo Contest #1 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=550.0):<br />(http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2186/2418653711_77d9d2c2b3_o.jpg)<br /><br />Photo Contest #2 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=1678.0):<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/3577078347_722b638d96_o.jpg)<br /><br />Photo Contest #3 (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=2829.0):<br />(http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3714529431_870032a826_o.jpg)

				By popular demand, the deadline is now <strong>Friday, May 7th</strong>.<br /><br />Okay, it wasn&#039;t popular demand (it was more like deafening silence). &nbsp;But Crabbypatty, now that we have extended the deadline, you have to submit something! &nbsp;:)<br /><br />

				Since I moved to JH I&#039;ve always admired the beautiful doorways and pediments of many of our lovely buildings here.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pity that such architectural detail seems to be disappearing.

				<br />It&#039;s time to vote!&nbsp; Since I&#039;m about to leave on a road trip for the weekend, I&#039;m closing this contest 5 hours early... if you submit something between now and midnight tonight, I&#039;ll add it to the poll when I return on Monday.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that some of the images have been severely compressed to fit into the website&#039;s upload restrictions.&nbsp; Higher-quality versions of these photos are available, and will be used for the final banner.<br /><br />Please also keep in mind that the final image we use will have approximately the same proportions as the banner we&#039;re currently using.&nbsp; So any standard-sized photo will need to be cropped significantly.&nbsp; But a thin slice of a squarish photo can still look great!&nbsp; Once a winning photo is selected, we will work with the photographer to find the best way to crop the image for the banner.<br /><br />Apologies to any contestants who don&#039;t like the names I&#039;ve given to your photos... I&#039;d be happy to edit them on Monday if you let me know that you&#039;d like a change.<br /><br />Voting will remain open for two weeks.&nbsp; Good luck, everyone!<br /><br />
