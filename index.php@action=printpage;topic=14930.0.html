				Today my mother was standing outside of Fillmore Hall waiting for her friend when the super ( or I assume the super) came out of the apartment building telling her she was standing on private property. He became incredibly aggressive for no reason, told her she was standing on private property, gave her the finger, said &quot;fuck you&quot; and walked inside. My mother took out her phone and then the super returned with his phone, charged towards her screaming &quot;take your glasses off, take your glasses off&quot; and got up into her face as she recorded him.<br /><br />Can someone please tell me how I can get in touch with Fillmore Hall management to report this? I went online but only found a number for the estate agency.

				You should report it, but describe the person and&nbsp; make sure it&#039;s the super and not some other employee or random resident before accusing them!

				Yikes. <br /><br />If it&#039;s an older gentleman with a gruff voice and an accent (eastern European), that&#039;s the super.&nbsp; He&#039;s a bully and no threat to anyone.&nbsp; Just a very, very grumpy old man.&nbsp; It&#039;s a lovely building with an attentive (but not an overbearing board) and management would want to know of this incident if it was in fact the super.<br /><br />So sorry that this happened! So weird.
