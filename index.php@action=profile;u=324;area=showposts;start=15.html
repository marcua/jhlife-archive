					I think Breezie is giving Caffe Bene a bit too hard of a time, given that they opened their doors so recently!&nbsp; My partner and I went to Caffe Bene this afternoon around 1:30 p.m.&nbsp; They are still definitely working out some kinks (the ordering situation was a bit chaotic, and it seems like they have yet to get the hang of their computers, as they ended up writing orders for the kitchen down with a sharpie on register tape), but the space is quite cute, with lots of warm light from the copious Edison bulbs, planters in the windows, and comfortable chairs.&nbsp; Breezie is right that the tables are a bit on the tiny side, and the chairs don&#039;t tuck away entirely, but it&#039;s certainly far more comfortable than the perpetually overrun Starbucks!&nbsp; We split a ham, egg, and cheese bagel, which was pretty tasty (though just between you and me, the best ham, egg, and cheese bagel in the neighborhood is to be had at Central Cafe), and a cinammon raisin bagel with walnut cream cheese, which was delightful!&nbsp; Their bagels have a nice chew to them, and they don&#039;t go overboard with the cream cheese, mercifully.&nbsp; The drip coffee was fine, but I preferred the americano, which was a bit stronger.&nbsp; I was jealous of all of the people having waffles, which looked quite delicious indeed.&nbsp; They have a wide selection of upscale beverages--flavored Pellegrinos, multiple types of mineral water, Ronnybrook drinkable yogurts, kombucha, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Put simply, it&#039;s a welcome addition to the neighborhood--a clean, well-lighted place with some novel snacks and a nice atmosphere.&nbsp; Do they have some wrinkles to iron out?&nbsp; Certainly!&nbsp; But it&#039;s to be expected, and I look forward to going back and seeing Caffe Bene grow into a new neighborhood institution.&nbsp;

					As an initial matter, I wouldn&#039;t trust Seamless reviews as far as I can throw them -- people don&#039;t take time to leave positive reviews on there as often as they take the time to go on there and zing restaurants for some minor delivery malfeasance.&nbsp; Yelp is slightly better, except that, as with predecessors like Chowhound, reviewers seem to delight in nothing more than remarking that &quot;X restaurant has gone downhill,&quot; or that &quot;there is no good [insert type of food] in Jackson Heights anymore.&quot;&nbsp; But enough with my rant.&nbsp; As for your specific question, I have had great luck with Juquila.&nbsp; They are on Seamless, and while I haven&#039;t had their enchiladas, their burritos, tacos, various platos, and their Mexican Cobb salad have all been solid, and really quite tasty indeed! I order from them on a fairly regular basis, and have not been let down yet.&nbsp; And if you are in the mood to leave the apartment, their physical location has a pretty cute atmosphere too (not your standard former-travel-agency drop-ceiling-and-plastic-tables delivery joint).&nbsp;

					Agreed.&nbsp; This place is really outstanding!&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone a couple of times so far--beautiful presentation of the dishes, and everything I&#039;ve ordered so far has been quite tasty.&nbsp; The tortilla soup, with the tortilla strips sticking up like a Frank Gehry building and the soup poured tableside, is a particular fave.&nbsp; And the owners are super nice and friendly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing my best to patronize the place as much as possible, as it&#039;s nice to have a clean, inviting, delicious, and affordable new place in the nayb. Do give it a try!

					Don&#039;t know if this has already been posted about, but there&#039;s a tasty new pizza joint on Northern around 84th.&nbsp; It&#039;s called Pagliaccio Pizza, and I&#039;ve ordered from there several times already -- fast delivery, good prices, and pizza that is definitely a cut above anything else available in the neighborhood.&nbsp; They don&#039;t have a website, but search for them on Facebook -- they have their menu posted there.&nbsp; Cash only, unfortunately.&nbsp; Worth a shot if you are in the mood for good pizza!

					Gosh, this sure was a busy crime weekend!&nbsp; I was mugged and assaulted on my walk home from the subway at around 4:15am Sunday morning.&nbsp; I was only about ten steps away from my building on 85th Street when two guys walking in the other direction punched me repeatedly and took my wallet and messenger bag. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure the tanking economy has something to do with rising violence, but I hope that increased vigilance and enforcement can keep things from escalating further.&nbsp;

					I know it&#039;s not exactly hidden, but Rudy Volcano on 37th really is a lovely store for gifts, especially textiles.&nbsp; Plus they have an adorable (and famous!) store cat!&nbsp;

					Yes! Cesar is great!&nbsp; He is currently doing a bunch of renovation work in my apartment--his plaster work is incredible and VERY fast.&nbsp; He did a great job painting as well, and seems to have a good eye for detail (at least when it comes to walls--I haven&#039;t had him do any tilework, so not sure about that).&nbsp; Good price too.&nbsp; I&#039;m having him do some floor and moulding work, and I&#039;ll post about it once it&#039;s done.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=391.msg2605.html#msg2605">Quote from: orzabelle on February 22, 2008, 08:09:28 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bob from Elmwood Plumbing is awesome.<br /><br />Agree also on Antonio Electric<br /><br />The FASTEST and best skim-coat/plaster guys I know are from El Campeon Construction.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cesar only speaks Spanish, but he is a lovely man, and he is awesome at skim coating.&nbsp; (And very reasonable)<br />646-245-5961<br /><br />If you call him, tell him that Claudia (pronounce it Cloudia!) rec&#039;d him.&nbsp; He also did our tilework in our kitchen and bathroom, and though they are inexpensive, they didn&#039;t do the most perfect job (my dh is an architect and notices imperfections I never would notice in a million years, but he agrees that they are great at skim-coating)<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
