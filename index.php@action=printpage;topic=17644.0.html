				It&#039;s been a source of frustration to me that we can&#039;t seem to get a really good gym to come to Jackson Heights (I have looked into Blink and Planet Fitness and opted to continue to going to NYSC in Astoria).<br /><br />For those of you who are already traveling to a gym outside the neighborhood, you&#039;ll soon have another option in LIC on Northern Blvd, which is not that hard to get to by subway from Jackson Heights. I&#039;m not sure if they will have parking.<br /><br />This is an article from 2017 but they&#039;ve been posting recently on instagram that the facility is almost ready to open.<br /><br />https://commercialobserver.com/2017/08/powerhouse-gym-alma-realty-corp-30-30-northern-boulevard/

				Blast from the past.&nbsp; I was a member of this gym in the 90&#039;s when I lived downtown in the city.&nbsp; They used to have several branches there, but they eventually closed all of them.&nbsp; From what I can remember, membership was cheap, and the equipment was not very well maintained.&nbsp; As a result, once the city started to get better gyms, the chain folded there.&nbsp; Maybe they learned their lesson.

				I&#039;d love for JH to have a boutique fitness studio that has circuit training classes like Fhitting Room. Closest one is Urban Jungle in Woodside but it&#039;s still a trek.
