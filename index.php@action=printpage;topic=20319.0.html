				Have you ever been to a Lidl? <br /><br />This article mentions Lidl&#039;s first store in Queens, opening in Astoria in 2021. https://www.connect.media/lidl-to-open-first-queens-location/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20an%20East,new%20format%20early%20next%20year. Most likely only convenient for JH&#039;ers who have a car, since it&#039;s not near transit.<br /><br />This one talks about how special Lidl is: What is Lidl? Why this discount grocery store is giving Aldi a run for its money (https://www.today.com/food/what-lidl-discount-grocery-store-giving-aldi-run-its-money-t182688)<br /><br />(https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_22/1574841/lidl_exterior-what_is_lidl-300520_15784688d84e6c1490f5490c3929503b.fit-2000w.jpg)<br /><br />

				Went to one a couple of weeks ago in Long Island. <br />I preferred it to Aldi, as Aldi in ReGo is a bit too warehousey for my taste. Lidl is basically a supermarket with a big cheese, meat section and includes a small bakery. Lots of other stuff too. Reminded me more of a walmart supermarket combined with a Fairway. Not sure what the standouts are yet. I wouldn&#039;t make a special trip for it but I would love to live next door.

				Like the article mentions, this new Lidl is replacing a Best Market. We were getting groceries delivered from Best Market last spring but what&#039;s interesting is that all the paper bags already had Lidl printed on the side. Seems that this transition has been in the works for a while.

				I LOVE going to Lidl in Europe - I hope they are able to bring in some of the same goodies they stock there!

				&nbsp;I can&#039;t imagine the Lidl&#039;s in Astoria being a patch on its European cousins. The UK Lidls which I know well had an interesting and sometimes surprisingly good wine and spirits section-many no-name brands but often winners in blind tastings. Their cheese section was very good, croissants were baked in-store ovens so they were fresh and their sweet smell would waft through the store. They had a full range of Spanish, German, and Italian ham along with Scottish smoked salmon, smoked mackerel,et al. Of course, the prices were consistently discounted so they were much cheaper than US equivalents. Everything else was proprietary brands-they cloned everything Initially, the first Lidls were seen as downmarket no-frills places for shoppers only interested in bargain basement produce but because Lidls managed to provide quality and budget pricing they pretty rapidly became a major and influential player in the supermarket world. Their check-out system btw was as Trader Joe&#039;s one long line for a free register No friendly guidance however just a very long line. <br />I would add that Lidl can be found right across Europe and they are all the same so that going to the Lisbon Lidl feels like your local supermarket back home. I hope this marketing concept will apply to the Astoria store although I am not sure that car-less, as I am even a Lidl, would tempt me to go to the difficult to reach Astoria store more than once.

				I go to either Lidl or Aldi every other week. They usually empty out after 6 PM so the crowds are much smaller than other Long Island supermarkets. Nothing like Fairway as the only service areas are the deli and bakery counters which have mostly been unattended during the pandemic. I miss the Fairway salmon counter and cheese counter with their free samples, and I miss the antipasto bar with the olives and pickles veggies (something Best Yet also had, though on a smaller scale.) Lidl is mostly pre-packaged goods as the produce is in cello wrap and the meats are good quality and fairly priced. The fish is mostly frozen. Limited selection of brands with mostly private label versions rather than the actual name brands. Flower bouquets are available, and there is a rotating stock of clothing and kitchen wares available at attractive prices. Small in size and sparsely staffed. Major difference between Lidl and Aldi seems to be that Aldi makes you pay a 25 cent deposit to use a shopping cart. Clean restrooms in both stores. One has self checkout but I forget which one, sorry.

				&nbsp;Am excited to try this as I think the Aldi items are great quality and it&#039;s less of a pain in the butt to get to than our local TJ&#039;s. I am pretty happy with the new Fresh something supermarket on 79th and Northern as <br />it is clean and the aisles are wide enough to stand in front of items while you make your selection. Sorry to<br />see the Best market go but this may be a great replacement.
