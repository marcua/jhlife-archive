Dare to dream.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />My observation is that online... contrary opinions are called pablum by certain posters. These posters should look in the mirror. Their own opinions are equally pablum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Their monotonous negative pablum is being met by similar toned, but contrary and apposite positive pablum. <br /><br />One recurring lesson from the online world...often folks can dish it out...but they sure can&#039;t take it.

			in debates, online or otherwise, people believe they are making statements that are &quot;positive&quot; (or &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;helpful&quot;), and believe the opposing viewpoint is &quot;negative.&quot; it&#039;s a knee-jerk reaction, and it&#039;s human nature, not learned behavior.

			Yes.<br /><br />Positive and negative are relative.<br /><br />And an online environment makes this obvious. (It&#039;s a philosophical discussion. Does absolute truth exist? Probably not. According to Godel, not even in Math.) <br /><br />People online definitely don&#039;t communicate as they do in real life. <br /><br />From Grindr to this forum, the style of communication online is specific to the environment online.<br /><br />People&#039;s character traits, like wanting to correct others, for instance, ...which may be a control issue...do come through of course.<br /><br />But an online environment is certainly a parallel world to reality. <br /><br />Does it have similarities to online gaming...but with words? Maybe. <br /><br />
