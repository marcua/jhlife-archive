				On Tuesday, September 23rd, the UN is convening an unprecedented summit on climate change. On Sunday, September 21st, the largest climate march in history is set to take place to demand en masse that heads of state take real, immediate, and urgent action on the most severe crisis we have ever known. <br /><br />This march will be in the history books. I really hope Jackson Heights comes out strong for this.<br /><br />For details check the website: http://peoplesclimate.org/. And if you have 50 minutes to spare, check out this short documentary that was released today documenting the buildup to the march: http://watchdisruption.com/.<br /><br />Please spread the word to friends, neighbors, and coworkers. This will be a truly historic event happening just a short subway ride away. All we need to do is get the word out and show up.

				I hope to see many Jackson Heights faces at the People&#039;s Climate March tomorrow! It is gearing up to be the largest in history but it needs to be even larger. If you do come, do not try to enter at Columbus Circle -- the police will redirect you further north. It is best to take the subway to somewhere in the West 60s, 70s, or 80s, and join the march there.<br /><br />For details, check the website: http://peoplesclimate.org/march/<br /><br />Hope to see Jackson Heights represented in this historic event. It&#039;s too big to sit out.

				Tomorrow is the climate change march starting at Columbus Circle. Was wondering if there was anyone from Jackson Heights going. Pretty important.

				My family will be there, and I&#039;ve heard about several other families in the neighborhood who are going as well.<br /><br />As 83Street indicated, information about the march is here:<br />http://peoplesclimate.org/march/<br /><br />Note that groups will be gathering on Central Park West around 11 am.&nbsp; You will only be able to access Central Park West via 65th, 72nd, 77th, 81st, or 86th streets.&nbsp; <br /><br />The march itself is lining up according to a &quot;narrative&quot; -- with different groups that tell a similar part of the overall story marching together.&nbsp; &nbsp; More information on this narrative and where the various groups fit in is available here:<br />http://peoplesclimate.org/lineup/<br /><br />Have fun!

				Thanks to all the Jackson Heights community members who came out to the People&#039;s Climate March today. The sheer number of people who attended the event blew any historical precedent out of the water. You will all be in the history books.

				ECG:&nbsp; I know, it all feels futile sometimes, especially with an issue as complex and murky as climate change.&nbsp; The issue is all about rates of change over the long run.&nbsp; We&#039;re probably never going to see the dramatic action we need to avoid significant damage to the climate (and/or mitigation at great expense down the road), but there&#039;s still a good chance we can see enough change to avoid the very worst scenarios.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some change is already happening.&nbsp; New York City, at least, is undertaking ambitious efforts to reduce its emissions (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/nyregion/new-york-city-plans-major-energy-efficiency-improvements-in-its-buildings.html).&nbsp; And internationally, the U.S. and China have started working together on pollution reduction strategies (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-climate-policy19-20140919-story.html#page=1).&nbsp; There&#039;s still a long way to go, and I know our nation&#039;s politics feel broken, but I have to believe that the spectacle of 300,000-400,000 people participating in the largest environmental march in history will make a difference in demonstrating to elected officials that there is poltical support for action.&nbsp; The economics of energy have actually been shifting rapidly in recent years, and it&#039;s not entirely impossible to imagine that the politics of energy could begin to shift as well.
