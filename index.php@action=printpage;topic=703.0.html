				Any comments on this?<br /><br />There&#039;s an article in the Times today (April 5, 2008) called Taking the Pulse of the Boroughs (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/06cov.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=realestate). <br /><br />The overall gist is that prices have dropped, but in the section on Queens, it starts off by saying &quot;Queens may be the most difficult market to explain, because prices can vary by neighborhood and even by block. &quot;<br /><br />Then on the next page there are a few paragraphs on one couple&#039;s experience in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />&quot;Last month, Steven Toledo and his partner, Pedro Julio Serrano, signed a contract on a one-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights for $220,000. They negotiated the original asking price down from $240,000 after pointing out to the sellerâ€™s agent, Jorge Mejia of the Argo Corporation, that the bathroom tiles needed to be replaced. <br /><br />Mr. Toledo said they bought now because they didnâ€™t think the apartmentâ€™s price would drop any further. The apartment they bought is a sponsor unit, and they had to put down only 10 percent, or $22,000. They also were able to get a mortgage at 6 percent interest. <br /><br />Mr. Toledo pointed out that this is an established immigrant community, not a gentrified neighborhood that is dependent on Manhattan transplants for price appreciation. <br /><br />â€œWhen I see other neighborhoods around there,â€ he said, â€œI think this neighborhood has so much room to grow.â€<br /><br />

				Generalizations again.<br /><br />We just are not &#039;immigrant&#039; or &#039;yuppy&#039;! What about the many many native JH people who are, some of them, 4th generation natives. Don&#039;t we count here somewhere?<br /><br />Glad to know that the prices are holding steady, though.<br /><br />Sorry for the mini-rant. It probably belongs in another thread.

				Just noticed this paragraph in a &quot;just updated&quot; article about JH in Time Out NY Kids (http://www.timeout.com/newyork/kids/articles/features/10818/if-you-want-a-nabe-chockablock-with-great-ethnic-cuisine-try-jackson-heights).<br /><br />It says:<br /><strong>What youâ€™ll pay</strong>Prices range from $225,000 to $550,000 for a two-bedroom apartment, depending on amenities such as elevators, doormen, resident garages, balconies and fireplaces. One recent listing featured a 1,250-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath prewar apartment for $455,000. The unit included a full dining room, eat-in kitchen, hardwood floors and laundry in the basement. A 975-square-foot two-bedroom with two exposures listed for just $240,000. Broker Daniel Karatzas, of Beaudoin Realtor, was born in the area and wrote a book on Jackson Heightsâ€™ history. He is passionate about his native â€™hood: â€œThis area&nbsp; has character and charm, and people move here because itâ€™s a great place to raise kids.â€ <br /><br />I find it odd that they chose to highlight a &quot;975 square foot&quot; 2 bedrrom for 240K.&nbsp; In my experience (and I have been helping a friend apartment hunt) this price is well below market for a 2 bedroom apartment of that size in JH.&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s possible the unit is in Northridge, where I&#039;ve noticed that prices tend to be lower than those within the historic district.<br /><br />What I&#039;ve seen lately in the 240K range are 750 sq foot one bedrooms.<br /><br />

				Also, even the places that do allow subletting have restrictions.&nbsp; Perhaps the rules might say you must live in the bldg for 18 monhts, and then if you want to sublet you can do it only for a max. of 2 years --and then only with board approval.<br /><br />You really have to read the rules very carefully.<br /><br />On the other issue - the restriction on the transfer of shares - that&#039;s something I don&#039;t know anything about and I should educate myself.

				<strong>If I was going to buy a a coop in which I plan to stay for a very long time because I may be raising children or say it was my last purchase because I plan to retire there than I would absolutely go for a 100% owner occupied.&nbsp; Don&#039;t misunderstand me please.&nbsp; Getting to know your neighbor will likely happen more often in a 100% owner occupied building vs others.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is something quite positive to be said about living in &quot;owner occupied coops&quot;. In NYC we don&#039;t live in a <br />homogeneous society and some may not feel comfortable purchasing a property and living in a building or complex that may have a big turn out like a rental building or in a complex with a large percentage of sponsor owned units like the Acropolis in Astoria.&nbsp; In my personal experience, generally coop Boards will interview and assure that the person moving into the bldg meets a minimum socioeconomic status, unlike most condominiums (I said most, since that is changing as well).<br />&nbsp;<br />The Southride is a good complex for those that wish for 100% owner occupied.&nbsp; It is in fact an original Coop and they do have the most stringent of bylaws which may not fit a large percentage of buyers,&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that most buyers of coops are 1st time buyers and generally younger, we can assume that they will outgrow the apartment and have to either buy a larger unit or a house.&nbsp; This is when as Shelby mentioned, reading the bylaws are extremely important.&nbsp; Items like flip taxes, sublet policies, minimum deposits, share transfer or ownership by family members and landmark status can dramatically affect the sale price of the unit. <br />&nbsp;<br />To make a long story even longer...lol, Southridge limits a parent and children ownership and/or transfer of the units to one another or owning in the same building at the same time.&nbsp; These tactics are typically cooked up to ensure a fair control of shares and prevents the monopolization during the elections of Board of Directors.&nbsp; I don&#039;t recall their bylaws exactly but some of those rules are rarely used other than original Coops.&nbsp; In fact, I was reading their bylaws at one time for a person that was looking to buy there and I remember some of those bylaws.&nbsp; I want to say that I will not discourage anyone to buy in original coops, I am simply agreeing that one should make sure that the bylaws are read and make sure you understand what they mean before you sign and commit yourself because they may not meet your immediate or future requirements..&nbsp; </strong> &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m curious about how all these figures should be interpreted.&nbsp; The curbed report stresses that the average sales price in Queens is down 8.8% from the last quarter.&nbsp; However, if you look at the same quarter from the previous year, the average sales price in Queens didn&#039;t fall at all - it bascially remained exactly the same.<br /><br />So basically the reason it shows an 8.8% drop in sales price from the last quarter is because there was a spike in the sales price in the last quarter, and it has now declined by approx. the same amount it had spiked - therefore it shows what looks like a big decline in one quarter.<br /><br />Am I reading these numbers right? The report I clicked on was http://www.prudentialelliman.com/NYCPhotos/retail_reports/li-qu2q08locked.pdf<br /><br />Somehow given the gloom and doom of the market in general, I don&#039;t feel too worried about Queens when I see that the average sales price in Queens remained the same as a year ago.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also feel like Queens is a huge place with many factors affecting sales and pricing, and I would really like to see just stats for JH.<br /><br /><br />

				I agree, the numbers are confusing, and almost meaningless.&nbsp; Another issue is that they&#039;re no effort to control for comparables.&nbsp; We don&#039;t know, for example, if last quarter slightly larger apartments sold in pricier neighborhoods, and this quarter slightly smaller apartment sold in cheaper neighborhoods.&nbsp; If the mix changed like that, &quot;average price&quot; could fall even if prices for comparable apts. in comparable neighborhoods are rising.&nbsp; Of course, the opposite could be true when these data show prices going up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the big real estate firms have their own more complex models that provide a more detailed picture of what&#039;s going on, and just release these aggregate numbers for public consumption. <br />

				Todd and Shelby I agree with both of you.&nbsp; As a financial person who is used to creating or looking at statistics this information doesn&#039;t tell you much.&nbsp; Western Queens real estate has surged in the last few years which was in stark contrast to what happened 15-20 years ago when Eastern Queens real estate was on the upswing and Western Queens on the downswing.&nbsp; I also think that houses and coops/condos have a market unto themselves and Astoria, LIC, Woodside and Sunnyside may be&nbsp; a very different market then Richmond Hill, Ozone Park and Jamaica.

				I&#039;m no expert and a bit of a &quot;debbie-downer&quot; at times. What I think happens is the foreclosed property goes to auction on the steps of the County Courthouse. The highest bidder wins. The bad news is that real estate companies and developers will always outbid you. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

				Yeah,Eddie, I agree.&nbsp; &nbsp;how can u compare sales of Co-ops with sales of houses anyway?&nbsp; Even in tough economic times, houses do better than Co-ops, I think. But I don&#039;t like Co-ops with strict rules here in Queens.&nbsp; Yes, they may seem to create a higher quality of life but in well run buildings that exists.&nbsp; In buildings with all those restrictions, people who have to move and can&#039;t sell, take a hit which I don&#039;t like.<br /><br />I have friends in Bayside who moved to N.C. and have had trouble selling and can&#039;t sublet.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard.

				The price cuts have started in brooklyn where i live, but havent really seen any significant drops in JH. <br /><br />I have been watching the JH market since i intend to buy. Over all, I think asking prices have gone down a little bit (maybe 5% of 300K properties that i&#039;ve been looking at) but they may have wiggle room since some of these have been listed since spring, if the owners really want to sell.<br /><br />buddy, i find that some of the no sublet coops also have the some of the strictest downpayment requirements, making them unaffordable to many. i can see how 33% worked when apartments were selling for 150K but really tough once that price doubles. On a 300K apt, you&#039;d need around 130K in your account for down,closing cost and money left over that the coop usually wants to see. So like you said, a tougher sell.<br /><br /><br />

				Guess the market must still be pretty good if there are listings like this one still out there.<br />What amazes me most is that not the slightest attempt was made at cleaning up before the photos were taken.<br />http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/reb/973614788.html<br /><br />And I love the &quot;small spare bedroom off the kitchen&quot; phrase.&nbsp; Usually this is just called either an eat-in-kitchen or a junior 4.

				I think people need to be careful in confusing the asking price with the market price.&nbsp; A friend of mine has been trying to sell his coop in the historic district for 9 months without one offer.&nbsp; He has only lowered his price $15,000 (or about 3%) since his original listing because similar units sold for his asking amount 15 months ago.&nbsp; It is a very different market now with lenders harder to come by and much more inventory on the market.

				Isn&#039;t that the case only if you are ALREADY in a rent stabilized apartment? What if I am moving into an apartment in a rent stabilized building, doesn&#039;t the owner/landlord have the ability to bring a lower rent up to market level?

				The way I understand it, if there&#039;s a vacancy in a rent-stablized building, the owner can charge approximately an 18% increase for a new tenancy.&nbsp; Also the owner has the opportunity to do improvements to the unit and to the building.&nbsp; For each improvement, he&nbsp; can then apply to the rent stablization board to raise the rent based on that improvement.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Even if you are already living in the apartment, if the landlord makes certain improvements he can apply to have your rent raised.&nbsp; For instance, if he puts in a new stove and refrigerator, your rent can go up.)<br /><br />I think many of the rent stablized apartments that are listed are already at market rents due to vacancies and improvements.&nbsp; And apartments that are not stablized are not subject to any rules - the landlord can set a new rent at whatever he wants if the lease is up.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a fact sheet about how much rents are allowed to be raised in rent stablized units (http://www.housingnyc.com/html/resources/dhcr/dhcr26.html)

				One other comment.&nbsp; Once an apartment has reached $2,000 and the occupant(s) has an income of $175,000+ for the past two years the unit is no longer subject to Rent Stablilization.&nbsp; &nbsp;This would be more common in Manhattan than the other areas of NYC.&nbsp;

				This is more about renting...<br /><br />On our sister site, Astorians.com, a member has posted a very detailed account of his recent apartment search in both Astoria and the Upper East Side.&nbsp; It&#039;s a good read and I think it gives some indication of what the current climate is for renting in both a desirable neighborhood in Queens and in Manhattan.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thread (http://www.astorians.com/community/index.php?topic=13565.0).<br /><br /><strong>And here&#039;s a short selection </strong> <br /><em>For the past couple of days I&#039;ve been looking for apartments exclusively in the Upper East Side, Manhattan.&nbsp; There are a ton of deals floating around.&nbsp; In fact, the deals are so good that people in other parts of Manhattan are voluntarily breaking their current lease to snatch up the massive price drops.&nbsp; Listings that easily were $2,500 a couple of months ago are now going for $1,900 with some wiggle room to bargain.&nbsp; In fact, my friends tell me that most of their friends who currently reside in Astoria are moving into Manhattan due to the rental market crash.&nbsp; It seems like quite a few people are really trying to capitalize on this opportunity to get into the city.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ve actually found something in the UES that I like.&nbsp; It is a 3rd floor, large 1 bedroom in the 80s on First Ave.&nbsp; It is roughly 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the entire unit is in pristine condition.&nbsp; The asking price is $1,900 although the broker said that the landlord is flexible and will most likely take $1,800.<br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;ve also found something I like in Astoria just east of Steinway by Astoria Boulevard.&nbsp; It is a 2nd floor, large 1 bedroom, approximately 700 sq feet with modern appliances and the unit is in very good condition.&nbsp; AND it accepts pets!!!&nbsp; The asking price is $1,575 and the broker said that the landlord probably won&#039;t budge too much on the price.&nbsp; &nbsp;Herein lies my dilemma...</em>

				<strong>Trulia is a very weak reporter of statistics.&nbsp; Most of their sales reports are theirs.&nbsp; I used them all the time but I can tell you it doesn&#039;t tell you half the story.&nbsp; Jackson Heights last year was selling so well that it was impossible to keep stock of the average apartment.&nbsp; There was many more construction filings and work going on so therefore much more activity.&nbsp; Many <em><span class="bbc_u">NEW</span></em> 3 family houses sold for over a million plus thus showing a larger than true representation of comparable sales.&nbsp; Jackson Heights has many different areas.&nbsp; I would point out south and north of Northen Blvd., the Historical district, the 90&#039;s vs the 70&#039;s and so on.&nbsp; The smarter owner is not putting their units out there into the market right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of the better and more &quot;exclusive&#039; buildings have nothing in the market.&nbsp; Meanwhile last year there were many more of those units or &quot;better properties&quot; in the market.&nbsp; It would be unfair to explain the market in areas like Jackson Heights using web sites like Trulia.&nbsp; &nbsp;Trulia does not have the ability to differentiate between a &quot;Good Block&quot; or a &quot;Not so good Block&quot;.&nbsp; Trulia does provide great &quot;general data&quot; but I can tell you that there are many units out there selling well in good buildings but unfortunately not sufficient to accurately compare apples with apples.&nbsp; Trulia reported 2 open house but we know there were over a dozen of them this past week alone.&nbsp; &nbsp; I bet if you pick the better buildings and compare them to the not so sought after buildings you will see that there are many crappy apartments for sale and no competition.&nbsp; In other words, people looking for nice apartments cannot find the real deals out there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many went out there and paid a tremendous amount of money for 1 and 2 or even 3 family houses and they thought they were going to flip them. Reality check, it&#039;s over and now many of those people that paid top dollar for houses are trying to dump them and the banks are now taking them in and short selling them.&nbsp; <em>This is not representative of Coops I assure you.</em></strong>

				<strong>hunnybear,<br /><br />Trulia uses sophisticated software to link other websites into theirs (and vise versa)and somehow uses fancy mechanism to interact with each other and converts numbers into weekly, monthly and or yearly statistics.&nbsp; The problem is that they depend on people that actually use Trulia to list their listings and they represent such a small percentage of sold or even listed properties I wouldn&#039;t use them to report statistics.&nbsp; Now, if I were selling in a specific neighborhood and Trulia said the prices here have increased and that the properties is this or that and overall they are saying something positive I would say to a prospective buyer that &quot;Trulia has reported positive statistics for this zip code&quot; etc, and this would be a statement of facts.&nbsp; Not a statement of the market as factual but a fact that Trulia said so.<br />u<br />I rarely use Trulia and neither most of the realtors I know.&nbsp; Trulia may become a great listing source one day but today it&#039;s more of a pop thing.&nbsp; They rarely produce real buyers and even though you will have the occasional Turlia Pro user that swear by it when you really look closely they will still tell you that Trulia is good as a complement to whatever you are already doing to market listings.&nbsp; Remember, I wrote they were a poor source of statistical reporting.&nbsp; LIBOR has a great statistic mechanism and monthly reports but it is for the use of members.&nbsp; They will regularly produce reports for the general public.&nbsp; MLS is the standard marketing tool.&nbsp; Basically, a listing agent list and trows it in the pool hoping some other agent sells it while he or she simply list the property.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with that, especially in a good market where everything sells.&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong> &nbsp;

				I think geographic boundaries are a little strange in that report too, but no matter where you draw the line, someone&#039;s gonna be unhappy. I&#039;d argue that easy-commutable-to-Manhattan queens (LIC, Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside, JH, Elmhurst, Rego Park, Forest Hills, KG) versus other, more car dependent neighborhoods (East Elmhurst, Ridgewood, Middle Village, Glendale etc) might bring up interesting results. <br /><br />I think what&#039;s interesting in that report, however, is the strength of coops versus houses in Queens - coops have essentially stayed stable (a 2% drop in median sales prices over prices a year ago) versus houses (a 16% drop in median sale prices over a year ago). Yay, coops!
