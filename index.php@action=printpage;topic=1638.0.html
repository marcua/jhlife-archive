				This is a wonderful idea.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Not for me, mind you, I&#039;m married, but I have two unmarried local friends (JH residents) who I am passing this on to.) <br /><br />The singles scene was always a bit harsh here (even when I was single in the early 90s), there were few options (Budd&#039;s Bar???) in the neighborhood.&nbsp; The bar/local mini-club scene was more Sunnyside based as I recall.<br /><br />The singles of all ages must still have a hard time (though I imagine the coffee shops are the answer for the &#039;Gen Y&#039; crowd) ... one day last month, an older lady (I say that respectfully, but I&#039;m 38 and she looked at least 50), teenage son in tow no less, actually hit on me outside the fruit market and asked for my number!&nbsp; <br /><br />So the question this begs is .. the singles event at the cafe, is it all ages?&nbsp; Seems there would be a 20s night, a 30s night, 40+ etc.&nbsp; (Because the friends I just emailed about this are both in their 30s.)&nbsp; Or is more like &quot;any singles all ages feel free to stop by&quot; ...?<br />

				For this first go-round, it&#039;s all ages - the main thing is that people really need to bring along a friend of the opposite sex - that way, the ratio will be even.&nbsp; We have started dreaming up follow-up singles night ideas and will tailor future nights based on how next week&#039;s turns out.<br /><br />

				WOW...Will there be a sign on the door saying &quot;FAGS STAY OUT&quot;. If the American People have spoken the&nbsp; times have gone back to before June 27,1969. How would people feel if a establishment had a function in Jackson Heights and said no Indians tonight or Spanish speaking people tomorrow. We are looking for a night for overweight people if we get requests. If that sounds insensitive that&#039;s my point. Jackson Height is a very Gay Community with a long struggle. I wonder who the American People are that have spoken? Espresso 77 has many Gay customers like myself who&#039;s money is keeping it going, so maybe the patriotic thing to do is spend it somewhere else.

And the post didnâ€™t say gays were unwelcome, but that â€œSo far it&#039;s just our straight latte-lovers who have been asking for this opportunity.â€ And for all we know, some members of the opposite-sex couples who attend may be transsexual. As you say, â€œEspresso 77 has many Gay customers,â€ so I wouldnâ€™t leap to the conclusion this is necessarily discrimination. (And for those not in the know, 27 June 1969 is the date of the Stonewall Rebellion credited with galvanizing the gay liberation movement.)<br />

				Update:<br />I was standing in front of e77 at around 9ish tonight with my girlfriends and I didn&#039;t see much movement.&nbsp; Where was everybody.&nbsp; Was I the only married, Puerto Rican, Irish, Italian, straight woman that wanted to attend?&nbsp; My other Roumanian girlfriends had no clue, but was updated immediately on the event.&nbsp; I think I saw one gorgeous man inside.&nbsp; Ladies you missed it.&nbsp; I think he was hiding behind the counter with Afzal the owner.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I went tonight at 730 and checked back at 830. There was one lady in there and a worker. No one else. I was really disappointed. I even did my hair.<br /><br />Also, I dont think you should be offended that it was straight singles night, there was no mention that gays were not allowed tonight. I told my gay friend that there might be a gay singles night, and he said he would go. Being straight, I wouldnt go that night because there would be no point for me. A mixed crowd would be fine too but that cafe is so small. Wait, what am I saying? There wasnt even anyone in there tonight... Maybe it should be mixed so at least more than one person would fill a chair.<br /><br />What a bust.

				Tsinnyc, I find your post really inflammatory and personally really hurtful.&nbsp; If you knew me or my husband, then you would know that we are friendly with and supportive of the GBLT community and that we do not discriminate in who we welcome to our store and who we hire.&nbsp; Please get to know us!<br /><br />Dividing things up between GBLT and Straight was really just determined by our space issues. <br /><br />JH LIfer Aronan and I are working on the GBLT Singles Night as I write...<br /><br />

				This initiative reminds me of the cafe, Drip, on the Upper West Side that doubled as a matchmaking service in the neighborhood.&nbsp; Anyone remember reading about this place in the late &#039;90s?<br /><br />Personal Ads Draw Love-Parched To (Mainly Coffee) Bar &nbsp;(http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFD7123CF93BA35751C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all)<br /><br />I think the only way the &quot;Drip&quot; idea would work at E77 would be the binder system--not a bulletin board--, and the only way you get to look in the binder is if you agree to submit your own info.&nbsp; Otherwise, I think people would feel too self-conscious and you might also get too many curiosity-seekers who have no intention of putting themselves out there.

				Julesnyc... Sorry if I said anything hurtful.&nbsp; The line the American people have spoken and it is the patriotic thing to do.When it comes to people meeting people of the opposite sex&nbsp; Was hurtful to many of us too. The Gay Community comes from a history of being seen as, illegal and Un-American and can still not do the patriotic thing as to serve the military openly. I am sure you and your husbands are good people with good intension&#039;s. But things must be said.

				Suggestion:&nbsp; <br />When you have an art opening you invite everyone.&nbsp; Therefore, if you have a singles gay, straight, or otherwise event, invite everyone as well.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Especially after the most recent uneventful singles night.&nbsp; I love my gays boys.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine being at a gathering without them.&nbsp; My lesbian girls, I LOVE YOU TOO! ;)

				I think if you want an event to happen, it&#039;s important you recruit for it too to make it a success. Not just mention it and expect 77 to do all the legwork for you. I&#039;m not sure if they do any advertisement outside of the coffee shop. I&#039;m not faulting them though, they can do whatever they want. It is your responsibility though to create a word of mouth if you want to have a good time. <br />so, lesbians, if you get yours, tell your friends, tell your friends friends, post it on event sites and message boards and slip it into conversations with strangers. Learn from straights&#039;s mistakes&#039;s. take ownership of your event and make it big!
