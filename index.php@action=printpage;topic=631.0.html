				I found a really good bakery called Martha&#039;s Country Bakery on Ditmars in Astoria. It has all types of pastries from cakes to cup cakes that are similar to the Magnolia famous cup cakes except with a variety of flavors.&nbsp; The bakery is open late and has seating so you can enjoy a beverage as well as a pastry.&nbsp; I know its not JHts but, its close enough and I thought I would share.&nbsp; :smiley6600:<br />

				There&#039;s a Martha&#039;s in Forest Hills too.&nbsp; I like the cupcakes from Magnolia better, but my friend swears by Martha&#039;s red velvet cake.

				There&#039;s a couple of great bakeries on Ditmars.&nbsp; The one I&#039;ve always gone to (but you can&#039;t sit down inside) is Giuli&#039;s Italian bakery.&nbsp; In summer they have delicious gelato.

				I stopped by Martha&#039;s earlier tonight for the first time.&nbsp; The bakery is nicely organized and they offer outdoor seating.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t in the mood for cake (very rare occasion for me ::)), so I tried a cranberry scone instead.&nbsp; Trying one scone may not be the best way rate this place, but I have to say that I&#039;ve had better scones.&nbsp; Strangely, I found it a bit on the salty side and much too dry.&nbsp; To be fair though, I&#039;ll have to go back and try something else...maybe a cupcake.&nbsp; Any recommendations on what&#039;s good?
