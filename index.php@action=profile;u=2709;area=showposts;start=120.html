					Oh thats horrible!&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the only way for it to ever change is to start complaining to 311 each and every time you see anything - if we pester them enough they should send enforcement agents to patrol, once they catch enough people in the act and give tickets hopefully people will start cleaning up.&nbsp; I really feel bad for the elderly population that I&#039;ve seen on my block, shuffling along with their shopping carts... I can&#039;t imagine that they are able to navigate that well.<br /><br />You can report online here:<br /><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/apps/311universalintake/form.htm?serviceName=SCAN+-+Dirty+Condition+-+Dog+Waste+-+Sidewalk&amp;referPage=%2Fapps%2F311%2FallServices.htm%3FrequestType%3Dservice%26levelOneId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE%26levelTwoId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3%26levelThreeId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3-0%26serviceName%3DDog%2Bor%2BAnimal%2BWaste%2BComplaint%26finalSubLevel%3D3%26intentId%3DE9E66310-8137-11DE-8E9F-96DAE110FEB8" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://www.nyc.gov/apps/311universalintake/form.htm?serviceName=SCAN+-+Dirty+Condition+-+Dog+Waste+-+Sidewalk&amp;referPage=%2Fapps%2F311%2FallServices.htm%3FrequestType%3Dservice%26levelOneId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE%26levelTwoId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3%26levelThreeId%3DD7C8F010-05B5-11DE-AC9C-EF5AFBC474DE-3-0%26serviceName%3DDog%2Bor%2BAnimal%2BWaste%2BComplaint%26finalSubLevel%3D3%26intentId%3DE9E66310-8137-11DE-8E9F-96DAE110FEB8</a><br /><br />Perhaps also there is some way we could work with the city and area buildings to install pet waste stations in some spots?

					I just moved into the Hampshire House last week and can&#039;t figure out why this thing is in my wall. I&#039;ve asked an electrician, google, the real estate agent (unfortunately the seller left the country and is hard to reach and he also had tenants after he moved out so he&#039;s not a sure answer anyway) as well as all my facebook friends and no one has a clue as to what this is for.<br /><br />Bad cellphone photo: <img src="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a2/ABedelia3/circuit.jpg" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />Its a circuit board, hardwired directly into the electrical system.&nbsp; My friend uninstalled it and nothing adverse has happened... yet.&nbsp; The facebook consensus was that it was a government or organized crime listening device (albeit a rather conspicuously placed one&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/rolleyes.gif" alt="&#58;&#58;&#41;" title="Roll Eyes" class="smiley" />). The one serial number I could get off one of the things on the board brought up timers on google.<br /><br />Someone went to some trouble to install it, make a plate cover and etc. for it so I&#039;d hate to toss it if it has some practical purpose... I just can&#039;t figure what purpose that might be.&nbsp; Misc details that are probably unrelated but since it was on my electrical system... I think this building was built late &#039;30s, I have no phone jack in the place, no electrical outlets in the bathroom but I have 7 circuit breakers for a 1 bedroom and while this was installed in the entryway it happened to be on the same breaker as my refrigerator.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone here have an answer or theories?<br />

I&#039;m in a completely different place than I ever would have planned for 2011, not better or worse... just unexpected.&nbsp; Happy to be out of Brooklyn and starting 2011 in Jackson Heights - looking forward to this year

					Lol thanks! I&#039;m afraid we&#039;ll need a lot of sugar and some big spoons...<br /><br />My former landlady let her dogs bite us tenants... As long as the general dog owning population isn&#039;t that selfish I&#039;ll be pretty happy <br />Everyone I&#039;ve met so far and the general vibe of what I know of the neighborhood just seems like there would be more consciencious types than those who can&#039;t bring themselves to bag it up. Rather disappointing to park my zipcar full of new neighborhood dreams and then realize I&#039;m trotting my stuff back and forth across a fecal mine field LOL its been the move from the bad warm place on sooo many levels... The feces were just the welcoming committee

					I just moved in and I&#039;m surprised at the amount of fecal matter on the sidewalk along my street (79th St) I have to do some serious watching where I step! Sad part is I can tell where others who were not watching have tracked it up the block.&nbsp; Is there just no enforcement here so no one bothers to pick up after their dog?<br /><br />Urine is gross enough but I can see how someone could plead ignorance, however there is no excuse for crap on the sidewalks.

					A good friend of mine is with sanitation - even he is at a loss for how bad this cleanup has been. But even though the entire force was called in, he was so snowed under he couldn&#039;t get out to get to work. Said half the force was out either as &quot;sick&quot; or car-down since they are as stuck as us and honestly a lot of the garages aren&#039;t that accessible by trains so they need their cars.<br /><br />Since so many are out a lot of the guys out driving have never driven a plow which is probably why we&#039;re seeing videos on youtube of cars being smashed :-)<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why everyone dwells on the inches. I think wind, drifting and ice conditions make more of a difference than several inches here or there... Once you go over a foot its all the same until about 2.5 feet :-). We should just have a grading system using ranges of accumulation as well as wind and temperature conditions to compare storms<br /><br />I think I&#039;m developing a deep hatred for snow after a few years here. Whereas I used to love it as I&#039;m from the south... But there we knew to just shut down at the prediction of snow: everyone buys out the grocery store, the nurses camp at the hospitals, no dares to drive and no one has to try to carry on as usual.&nbsp; Just drink hot chocolate with all the milk you bought at the store because you don&#039;t normally buy milk, its just survival instinct...:-)

					I just moved in and need a locksmith. Anyone have any recommendations and a guesstimate for prices?<br /><br />The set of keys I got from the seller is lacking a key to the deadbolt... But he did include a random key to nowhere to make up for the missing key.&nbsp; And the door knob is on wrong so I have the potential to get locked into my apartment... Which would be an interesting reason to call out of work I suppose :-)<br /><br />So, a cylinder change, reconfigure the knob and perhaps change that lock too. Any ideas what that will run me?<br /><br />Thanks!

					So, currently I have my dentist in Staten Island, ob-gyn in Bay Ridge, general practitioner in Gravesend and chiropractor in Bensonhurst...&nbsp; but after some time trekking all over, even from within Brooklyn, now that I&#039;m joining you all in JH I&#039;d really love to share a zip code or at least the same train with all my doctors<br /><br />Anyone care to share suggestions for providers in JH, or at least convenient to the F or 7 between Midtown and JH?<br /><br />Would prefer the ob-gyn to be female but no preference for the others<br /><br /><br />Many thanks in advance!

					Eh I&#039;m ready to buy and tired of the rental drain.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve got the money and rates are low.&nbsp; I realize I&#039;m looking for something other than the norm.&nbsp; I&#039;m just young, single and childless and hoping that all three rather than just the first will change&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/wink.gif" alt=";&#41;" title="Wink" class="smiley" />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m buying it for the long term but I don&#039;t want currently unknown life changes to force me to have to sell and potentially waste a bunch of money when I could just find that needle-in-a-haystack building now that will work for short and long term.&nbsp; I may live there 2 years or 20 but I need something that will work under both scenarios.&nbsp; <br /><br />I understand the board and long-term residents concerns and I know I&#039;ll do everything in my power to make it as easy as possible... I don&#039;t want sucky subletter anymore than they do.&nbsp; &nbsp;But thats partially why a building that doesn&#039;t have a cumbersome approval process or has the subletting business down to a science through the managing agent would be appealing, so my unit isn&#039;t a burden to them.&nbsp;

					Hi there,<br /><br />First I want to say that this board is invaluable.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been watching for a while and I&#039;m really impressed by all the helpful people on here! <br /><br />I&#039;m looking to buy and need a large 1 bedroom. Extra space for an office would be great but I don&#039;t think that exists in my price range.&nbsp; Depending on maintenance the budget tops around 215k... outdated, fixer-upper stuff I&#039;m totally cool with.<br /><br />Big issue that I can&#039;t always tell from listings, and where this forum&#039;s knowledge is needed... I need immediate subletting or unlimited subletting allowed after a couple years.&nbsp; I want this to be a long-term investment but I hope to only need to live there for a few years.<br /><br />Also I need to move ASAP (psychotic landlord/neighbor, mildly scared for my life) so any insight as to buildings with quick and efficient board approval would be helpful too.&nbsp; I can get my paperwork together in a snap... I&#039;ve read the NY Co-op Bible so I&#039;m armed with enough knowledge to make myself dangerous&nbsp; <img src="http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/Smileys/default/grin.gif" alt=";D" title="Grin" class="smiley" /><br /><br />Any buildings to suggest and/or buildings/addresses to definitely pass over when I see them show up in searches?<br />
