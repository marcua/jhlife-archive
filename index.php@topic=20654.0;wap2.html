			Anyone have recommendation for a Garage Door contractor? Our garage door needs to be replaced, as well as the wooden frame around it. <br /><br />It&#039;s been like pulling teeth to get any responses from many vendors online. And I always think...if it&#039;s this much trouble getting them to show up or respond to messages before they&#039;ve been hired, it&#039;ll probably be ten times worse once you&#039;ve signed a contract! <br /><br />So I&#039;m hoping someone in the neighborhood has had a good experience having a garage door replaced, and can vouch for the vendor they used.<br /><br />Thanks!
