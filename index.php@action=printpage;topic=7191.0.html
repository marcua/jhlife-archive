				Dear Community Member:<br />Each spring (starting in March) Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) provides a series of group sessions, <span class="bbc_u">at no fee</span>, as a service to the community.<br /><strong>For Children and Parents:</strong> The social skills program is based on extensive research, with the goal of increasing children&#039;s self-esteem &amp; social skills in a supportive environment. The children&#039;s activities focus on the development of life skills such as problem solving, using appropriate social skills, making and keeping friends, and how to deal with stress &amp; conflict.&nbsp; A parent&#039;s group will meet concurrently and focus on understanding the cues and specific needs of their child, how to respond to their child in developmentally appropriate &amp; nurturing ways, and on how to effectively manage common but challenging issues such as sleep, discipline, homework, siblings, &amp; routines.<br /><strong>For Adults: </strong>The Women&#039;s Group program, based on extensive research, provides a safe, respectful and accepting environment to learn about the impact of attachment styles through the life cycle, explore current patterns, and learn skills targeted to helping develop healthy relationships and connectedness, as well as to enhance self-esteem and well-being.<br /><strong>Queens College Psychological Center is located on the Queens College Campus at 65-30 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, Queens.&nbsp; For more information please call at: 718-570-0500 or email at&nbsp; QCPC@qc.cuny.edu&nbsp; Visit us at http:www.qc.cuny.edu/QCPC </strong> [The Queens College Psychological Center (QCPC) offers compassionate, high quality, evidence-based, psychological services for children, adolescents, and adults regardless of ability to pay. Treatment is provided by doctoral candidates in the Clinical Psychology: Neuropsychology Doctoral Program who are closely supervised by experienced and licensed faculty. All services are confidential.]<br />
