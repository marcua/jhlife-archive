It also showed strong growth of immigrant-owned businesses in the city.<br /><br />Between 1994 and 2004, the number of businesses in New York City increased 9.6 percent, from 192,405 to 210,783.<br /><br />Queens is the country&#039;s most ethnically diverse county filled with large immigrant communities, such as Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Flushing.<br /><br />During that same period, the number of businesses in Jackson Heights increased by 14.3 percent from 1,284 in 1994 to 1,468 in 2004. The number of businesses in Elmhurst climbed by 25.1 percent during the same period from 1,040 to 1,301, and the number of businesses in Flushing shot up by 54.6 percent from 2,364 to 3,654 over the decade<br /><br />&quot;These figures should wipe away any impression that immigrants are holding the New York economy back,&quot; said David Dyssegaard Kallick, principal author of the report. &quot;In fact, immigrants are a central component of New York&#039;s economic growth.&quot;<br /><br />In New York City, immigrants comprise 37 percent of the population. As part of the work force, the study showed 75 percent of immigrant men were employed, compared to 65 percent of U.S-born men.<br /><br />The study also found the majority of immigrants living in the state speak English and their English gets significantly better over time, the number of Hispanic- and Asian-owned businesses is growing rapidly, and about two-thirds of immigrants in the upstate and downstate suburbs own their own homes.<br /><br />Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said the report was evidence of the need for comprehensive immigration reform.<br /><br />&quot;For us to maximize immigrant contributions to the economy, we must stop treating immigrants like criminals and terrorists,&quot; she said in a prepared statement.<br /><br />Reach reporter Jeremy Walsh by e-mail at <a href="mailto:jwalsh@timesledger.com" class="bbc_email">jwalsh@timesledger.com</a> or by phone at 718-229-0300, Ext. 154.<br /><br /><br />

District 30, which covers Astoria, Long Island City and Jackson Heights, drew $10 million. To the south, District 27, which includes the Rockaways, received $12.6 million.<br /><br />Debra Wexler, spokeswoman for the city Department of Education, said the concentration of funding is no coincidence.<br /><br />&quot;We took a look at student characteristics and identified schools that have been underfunded relative to similarly situated schools,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Contracts for Excellence are designed to improve school and student performance by linking new investments to proven practices and programs. Under the law, a school district&#039;s Contract for Excellence must specify how the district will spend its increase in state aid.<br /><br />&quot;Providing additional resources without accountability is the same as throwing money at a problem and hoping it will just go away,&quot; Gov. Eliot Spitzer said when he announced the allocations.<br /><br />The money given to schools under Contract for Excellence is allocated for class size reduction, which may lead to the hiring of new teachers or the conversion or construction of new classroom space; for extending classroom hours or hiring new teachers so that students get more instruction; for staff training and development; and for restructuring middle schools and high schools.<br /><br />The overwhelming bulk of the funding in Queens districts will be used to reduce class size.<br /><br />Dmytro Fedkowskyj, vice president of Community Education Council 24, said District 24 has larger class sizes than most other districts in the city.<br /><br />He was skeptical about how the funding would actually be used.<br /><br />&quot;You have all these different agencies talking about how the money should be spent,&quot; he said. &quot;The DOE has its own way of thinking about and doing things, but then these advocacy groups come in with their own informed opinions. Not everyone&#039;s singing the same tune here.&quot;<br /><br />New York City Chancellor of Schools Joel Klein praised the program, calling it a &quot;plan that makes success more likely for our highest-need students and schools.&quot;<br /><br />The state Department of Education also recently approved the city&#039;s five-year class-size reduction plan. More than $153 million of the City&#039;s Contracts funding was designated for class-size reduction efforts, with these resources used to hire more than 1,300 additional teachers and create more than 925 additional classrooms.<br /><br />Fedkowskyj was emphatic about his district&#039;s overcrowding problem.<br /><br />&quot;At the end of the day, we need more classrooms to reduce class size,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Reach reporter Jeremy Walsh by e-mail at <a href="mailto:jwalsh@timesledger.com" class="bbc_email">jwalsh@timesledger.com</a> or by phone at 718-229-0300, Ext. 154.<br />

					A different type of food cart in the neighborhood...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/nyregion/thecity/25dinn.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/nyregion/thecity/25dinn.html</a><br /><br />The New York Times<br />The Chicken and Rice Man<br />By ADAM B. ELLICK<br />Published: November 25, 2007<br /><br />EVERY weekday, starting as early as 7 in the morning and continuing until 7 at night, weary-looking men dressed in threadbare jackets and worn running shoes gather at the corner of Roosevelt Avenue and 73rd Street in Jackson Heights, Queens, under the gloomy shadow of the el.<br /><br />Swiveling their heads as if watching a tennis match, the men scan each passing car, in the hope that a driver will stop and offer up $100 in exchange for a 10-hour day of grueling labor on a construction or demolition project on Long Island.<br /><br />But offers of work are few these days, and competition for jobs is intense. As winter approaches, a man can easily spend the entire day shivering and desperately hungry, because these day laborers, many of them from Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America, are not only poor immigrants in need of work; many are also homeless, or nearly.<br /><br />&quot;We come here to look for work,&quot; said a 47-year-old Ecuadorean named Carlos Suarez as he hugged a cheap leopard-print comforter that serves as his bed. &quot;There is none. What can we do?&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Suarez says that he has sometimes gone days without eating and has on occasion survived only on bread. But for the past three months, he has eaten at least one hot meal a day, thanks to a former illegal immigrant who, with the help of his mother, has become a guardian angel for these workers.<br /><br />The man, Jorge Muñoz, is an elfin 43-year-old who goes by the nickname Colombia, a reference to the country from which he emigrated 21 years ago.<br /><br />Every night around 9:30, he arrives at the intersection from his home in Woodhaven, driving a white pickup truck laden with enough home-cooked fare to feed the dozens of day laborers who congregate there.<br /><br />For many New Yorkers, Thanksgiving is a weekend to indulge in a brief stint of volunteerism at a church or soup kitchen. For Mr. Muñoz, the holiday is just another night devoted to feeding his unofficial flock.<br /><br />&quot;Every single night, Jorge is here,&quot; said one worker, his leathery face peering out from a hooded sweatshirt. &quot;Doesn&#039;t matter. Rain, thunderstorm, lightning. He do that from his good will, you know.<br /><br />&quot;He feeds everybody, make the stomach happy,&quot; the worker added. &quot;He&#039;s an angel.&quot;<br /><br />When Mr. Muñoz&#039;s truck pulled in, several workers pressed their faces to the tinted windows, hoping to catch a glimpse of dinner. Hopping into the back of the truck, Mr. Muñoz began untying steaming containers filled with hot chocolate and foil-covered trays of homemade barbecued chicken. As the workers accepted Styrofoam containers stuffed with hearty portions of chicken and rice, they thanked him as respectfully as if he were a parent, never mind that the 5-foot-2 Mr. Muñoz, with his buzz cut and boyish grin, could pass for 20-something.<br /><br />&quot;God bless you,&quot; one burly worker said as he dug into his meal. &quot;I haven&#039;t eaten in three days.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Muñoz replied with a smile, &quot;You can eat here every day at 9:30.&quot;<br /><br />The relationship between Mr. Muñoz and many of the men he feeds is personal. &quot;Uribe, you want more coffee?&quot; he asked as he saw a familiar face. &quot;Simon, do you want seconds on this pasta?&quot;<br /><br />In a way, Mr. Muñoz seems to need these men as much as they need him. His unofficial meal program gives meaning and focus to his life. He is as eager to help his motley clientele as they are to be helped.<br /><br />&quot;I know these people are waiting for me,&quot; he said of the emotions that fuel his quixotic and perhaps obsessive crusade. &quot;And I worry about them. You have to see their smile, man. That&#039;s the way I get paid.&quot;<br /><br />Big Heart, Special Tamales<br /><br />The operation through which these workers have been fed without charge began three years ago and is financed mainly from the $600 a week Mr. Muñoz earns driving a school bus.<br /><br />His life revolves almost entirely around preparing and serving the meals. All the cooking is done in the small house with gray vinyl siding where he lives with his 66-year-old mother, Doris Zapata, and his sister, Luz, who works for the Social Security Administration.<br /><br />He telephones home from the road a dozen times a day to plan the menus. He has few friends, and no hobbies.<br /><br />&quot;I haven&#039;t seen a movie in two years,&quot; Mr. Muñoz said one afternoon in his kitchen as he boiled milk for hot chocolate. &quot;But sometimes I listen to music when I&#039;m driving.&quot;<br /><br />His sister described the situation more bluntly. &quot;He got no life,&quot; she said, looking awkwardly away from her brother as she stirred a boiling pot of lentils. &quot;But he got a big heart. He really does.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Muñoz also has stamina. Every morning he gets up at 4:45 to assess his inventory of food, which is made available in part with the help of friends and acquaintances. He doesn&#039;t have to go far.<br /><br />A mammoth freezer that occupies nearly half the dining room is stocked with cooked meats and vegetables that he collects twice a week from Colombian acquaintances who work in the food industry on Long Island, but whose names Mr. Muñoz will not disclose so as not to jeopardize their jobs. The dining room table is laden with boxes of fresh but slightly wounded bagels and rolls donated weekly by Monteforte, an Italian bakery in Richmond Hill. From Tia Betty Mexica Bakery and Tortilleria in Woodhaven come bulging bags of sweet breads.<br /><br />&quot;One day Jorge just came in and asked for extra food for his guys,&quot; said Tomas Gutierrez, owner of Tia Betty. &quot;Tortillas, breads -- last week we made special tamales for his guys.&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Muñoz&#039;s porch is walled with bulk-size bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise, and the living room is littered with the bounty from his weekly trips to Costco: 15 bags of spaghetti, six cans of tomato sauce, and boxes of plastic containers in front of the television. Mr. Muñoz says he has not watched the television in more than a year.<br /><br />A Family&#039;s Tortured Journey<br /><br />Although Ms. Zapata does not help deliver meals, she is an equal partner in her son&#039;s operation, and her involvement is born in part from her own experiences.<br /><br />For the first years of her marriage, the family lived in a small city in Colombia. In 1974, her husband was killed when a passing truck sent a rock sailing into his head as he sat on a curb outside the coffee distribution factory where he worked. Although her parents visited monthly bringing food to feed Jorge and Luz, then 9 and 10, the help was not enough.<br /><br />In 1984, after a decade of struggle, Ms. Zapata left her children with her parents and began the journey that eventually would take her to Bushwick, Brooklyn, where she found work as a live-in nanny, earning $120 a week.<br /><br />Over the next two years she saved enough to bring her children to the city -- all three are now United States citizens -- but the osteoporosis and arthritis that have twisted her hands and hunched her back forced her into retirement seven years ago.<br /><br />All these experiences have given her particular empathy for the workers her son feeds.<br /><br />&quot;We were immigrants and we were illegal,&quot; Ms. Zapata said one afternoon as she poured lemon juice into a bowl of rice. &quot;So I imagine that the workers may also be going around in fear, hiding from the police, hiding from immigration.&quot;<br /><br />Ms. Zapata thinks she understands the feelings that motivate her son, whom she calls Georgie. He always had a good Samaritan side, she said, which was on display when he was just 7 and a man came by their house asking for food.<br /><br />Ms. Zapata told the visitor they had none. &quot;But Jorge gave him his plate,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I said, &#039;Jorge, you have to eat for school.&#039; And he said, &#039;No, I&#039;ll just have bread.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Guys Are Waiting for Me&quot;<br /><br />The mission shared by mother and son started three years ago when Colombian acquaintances who work in the food industry mentioned to Mr. Muñoz that excess food was thrown out at their workplaces. One evening around the same time, he noticed the knot of day laborers clustered under the el.<br /><br />Stopping to talk, he learned that most of them sleep under the bridge across the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway at 69th Street or in the emergency room of Elmhurst Hospital, where they can stay until they are booted out at 5 a.m. To save money, they skimp on meals, and the little money they pocket is immediately wired to destitute relatives back home.<br /><br />In the beginning, Mr. Muñoz&#039;s commitment to feeding these men was modest. Three nights a week, he stuffed each of eight brown bags with a piece of fruit, a cookie and a juice box, loaded the bags into his truck, and drove to the corner where the men congregated. Word spread, and within a year, Mr. Muñoz and his mother were churning out 15 hot dinners a night. Now they feed several dozen on a single evening.<br /><br />&quot;Once I started, I can&#039;t go back,&quot; he said as he headed off one recent evening. &quot;Those guys are waiting for me. These guys, they got nothing. They live in the street. They have no family. They have no relatives, nothing. They just wait for me. And I say, &#039;O.K., no problem.&#039;&quot;<br /><br />If It&#039;s Thursday ...<br /><br />Because donations are sporadic and quantities unpredictable, cooking for a crowd in a kitchen the size of a parking space presents a nightly logistical challenge.<br /><br />At 3 o&#039;clock one recent afternoon, Ms. Zapata could be found staring dubiously at a tray of cooked, frozen barbecued chicken that had been donated by one of her son&#039;s benefactors. By 4, the chicken had thawed, but she estimated that it would feed only 20 people. Her son, who had just returned from his afternoon bus run, said 30 meals were needed. And so began the nightly process of ad hoc menu revision.<br /><br />Time was of the essence. Mr. Muñoz tries hard to make sure the workers are fed at the same time every night; otherwise, he fears, he will lose them.<br /><br />On a calendar pinned to the refrigerator, which bears 10 images of Christ, Ms. Zapata had scribbled the week&#039;s menus. Tuesday: baked pork with beans. Wednesday: burgers in barbecue sauce with hash browns. Thursday: pasta with beef.<br /><br />As if seven nights weren&#039;t enough, on Fridays Mr. Muñoz collects donated waffles and pancakes, and he serves Saturday breakfast for 200 workers at seven locations in Queens. For Sunday dinner, on what he describes as his &quot;day off,&quot; he and his sister make 40 ham and cheese sandwiches.<br /><br />This afternoon, Mr. Muñoz and his mother scrutinized the week&#039;s menus to figure out what they could scrounge from storage without upending the rest of the week&#039;s schedule. After a quick survey of items on the porch, Mr. Muñoz decided on pasta with tuna.<br /><br />Soon, pots on all four burners on the stove were bubbling with milk, pasta, and white and yellow rice. While waiting for the chicken to warm, Ms. Zapata and her children began sorting bills on a chair in a bedroom; no other space was available. Electricity runs about $120 a month, and gas $100 every two months.<br /><br />According to Mr. Muñoz, the family spends about $200 a week on the meals.<br /><br />&quot;If I had a choice,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#039;d do a good breakfast with a proper budget. And I&#039;d do lunch, too.&quot;<br /><br />By 5 p.m. he was fading. He slouched against the kitchen wall and closed his eyes for a moment. Then he straightened up, poured his sixth cup of coffee of the day, and served himself a bowl of lentils over buttered rice. This was his dinner, and as the workers do, he ate standing up.<br /><br />By 8:30, the truck was loaded. &quot;Bye, Mami,&quot; Mr. Muñoz said as he gave his mother a kiss. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br /><br />En route, he stopped off at the International Ministerial Church of Jesus Christ in Woodside, as he does every night. When he arrived on the corner, the men lined up in single file in front of the bed of the truck, which functioned as a counter. He handed takeout containers to the men, who almost all returned for seconds. One man stuffed plastic boxes of orange juice into his pockets to tide him over until the next meal. Within 10 minutes, the truck was empty.<br /><br />Mr. Muñoz tipped over the hot chocolate cooler. &quot;I think there is a little bit left,&quot; he announced to one of the workers. &quot;There is a little, brother. You got the last drop.&quot;<br /><br />Hector Peralta, a ponytailed Mexican who came to the United States five years ago, has been eating Mr. Muñoz&#039;s dinners for four months. Without them, he said, he would go hungry. &quot;We wouldn&#039;t even know what to do,&quot; he said. &quot;This is my first meal since yesterday.&quot;<br /><br />Gratitude goes both ways.<br /><br />&quot;I feel great when I see these guys with their smiling face,&quot; Mr. Muñoz said. &quot;Because they got something to eat before they go to sleep.&quot;<br /><br />Ana Toro contributed reporting.

					<em>Where do you see Jackson Heights in 10 years?</em><br /><br />Are we doomed to succumb to the standardization and homogenization that so many other NYC neighborhoods have seen over the past decade?&nbsp; Or can we find a way to evolve in a direction that emphasizes the uniqueness that drew many of us newcomers to Jackson Heights to begin with?<br /><br />What&#039;s your vision for a more perfect Jackson Heights?&nbsp; <br /><br />To start this discussion off, I&#039;ve got a few (hopefully provocative) ideas to put on the table.&nbsp; I&#039;m an urban planner, but am admittedly a relative newcomer to the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure some of these ideas will be controversial, and perhaps naive, and I&#039;ll probably disavow half of them by the time this discussion is through.&nbsp; But I&#039;d be very interested in the perspectives of community residents -- newcomers and oldtimers alike -- on what ideas we can reach agreement on for a policy agenda for the neighborhood.<br /><br />So here are 10 proposals I&#039;d like to see implemented in our neighborhood:<br /><br />1. Expand Travers Park.&nbsp; Purchasing the auto dealership/repair shop property at the north end of Travers Park would provide a much-needed expansion of parkspace in our community.&nbsp; It would also remove an environmental nuissance -- fumes from the repair shop can be quite noticeable at the existing playground.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jhgreen.org/goals.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">JH Green</a> has been taking the lead on this effort.<br /><br />2. Fix the 73rd Street traffic mess.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.wjha.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">Western Jackson Heights Alliance</a> has been working to get the city to address the noise and other problems that originate from backed-up traffic on 73rd Street.&nbsp; The traffic on this street is problematic for a number of reasons:<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>73rd Street provides one of the few southbound routes through the neighborhood.</li><li>Traffic must exit 73rd Street at the intersection with Broadway.</li><li>Several of the retail businesses at 73rd Street and 37th Avenue have a regionwide customer base, which means that more of their customers arrive by car than might otherwise be the case.</li><li>There is insufficient turn-over in parking to accommodate the needs of these businesses&#039; customers and suppliers.&nbsp; This results in a high incidence of vehicles causing traffic congestion by double-parking</li></ul><br />In my view, there are several things the city can do to improve the situation: <br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Replace some parking spaces with loading/standing zones, so that cars and trucks don&#039;t need to double-park for deliveries and pick-ups.&nbsp; One way this could be implemented would be to remove 8-10 parking spaces fronting commercial properties on the west side of 73rd Street, and on both sides of 35th Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Streets.&nbsp; These spaces would become No Parking (Standing Only) zones, half of them for 24 hours/day and the other half for 7am-7pm.</li><li>Reverse the direction of 73rd &amp; 74th Streets between Broadway and Woodside Avenue, so that 73rd Street runs southbound and 74th Street runs northbound.&nbsp; This would improve overall traffic circulation, and would reduce backups at the 73rd &amp; Broadway intersection.</li></ul><br />3. Encourage the redevelopment of the blocks between Roosevelt Avenue and 37th Road.&nbsp; The commercial strip on the north side of Roosevelt Avenue, across from one of the busiest transit hubs in all of NYC, is surprisingly underutilized.&nbsp; There is clearly a need for more small-scale office space in the neighborhood, especially for small businesses serving the immigrant community (as demonstrated by the mini-explosion of development along 73rd Street).&nbsp; This strip should have buildings 5-6 stories high with small offices in the upper floors.&nbsp; This would hopefully take some of the pressure off development pressures along 73rd Street.<br /><br />4. Undertake an aggressive anti-pigeon initiative.&nbsp; The MTA should take aggressive measures to eliminate pigeon nesting under its structures along Roosevelt Avenue.&nbsp; And just as property owners are responsible for removing litter from their sidewalks, they should be held responsible for cleaning up any bird seed dumped there by well-meaning but misguided pigeon-lovers.<br /><br />5. Make Nortern Boulevard into an efficient transit corridor, with more frequent, faster, and more reliable bus service.&nbsp; The Mayor&#039;s plan for transportation improvements that short-term transit improvements that could implemented in conjunction with Congestion Pricing includes two proposals for Northern Boulevard (see <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/downloads/pdf/cb_report_queens.pdf" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">this document</a>, p. 29):<br /><br /><ul class="bbc_list"><li>Add a new bus on N. Boulevard that mirrors the Q66 and begins in Flushing. It would run on N. Boulevard, take a left on 61st street and connect to the LIRR station at Woodside.</li><li>Accelerate service on the Q66 by allowing it to run with limited stops.</li></ul><br />Eventually, the city should also enable traffic signals on Northern Blvd. to provide late buses with &quot;extended greens&quot; to improve bus reliability and reduce bunching.<br /><br />6. Rezone Northern Boulevard to eliminate auto-oriented development.&nbsp; All new development should feature continuous streetwalls without curb cuts or parking lots.&nbsp; <br /><br />7. Eliminate free parking.&nbsp; Allow residents to purchase annual parking permits, with revenues used for local public improvement projects.<br /><br />8. Build more rental housing near transit.&nbsp; NYC is facing tremendous growth pressures, and is expected to add 900,000 new residents by 2030.&nbsp; In our part of Queens, we are seeing an accelerating pattern of small houses being torn down and replaced with apartment buildings in areas that are inaccessable to transit and virtually require automobile ownership.&nbsp; I&#039;d argue that this trend will lead to a very congested, ugly future for our neighborhood.&nbsp; Instead, I would advocate building up the areas most accessible to transit -- along Broadway and Roosevelt Avenues -- to build higher-density apartment buildings that can meet the demand for rental housing.&nbsp; <br /><br />9. Establish a &quot;Neighborhood mobility hub&quot; at the parking lot on 75th Street.&nbsp; This is an urban planning concept taking hold across Europe that is especially well suited for the outer boroughs of NYC.&nbsp; It could include 2-3 parking spots for <a href="http://www.zipcar.com" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">carshare vehicles</a>, a <a href="http://www.nybikeshare.org/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">bikeshare rental station</a>, secure bike parking (and even perhaps bike repairs), an automated parcel delivery center (<a href="http://www.tower24.de/english/frameset_start_eng.htm" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">such as this one in Germany</a>), rental of hand trucks and other equipment, etc.<br /><br />10. Please, oh please, somebody open an excellent Middle Eastern/North African restaurant!<br /><br /><br />Do you like this platform?&nbsp; Hate it?&nbsp; What would you like to see change in our community?&nbsp; Or are things already perfect as they are?<br />

Brown | Special to amNewYork<br />November 19, 2007<br /><br /><br />Armed with scissors, tape, and a few yards of pink twine, the leaders of New York City&#039;s Bengali community yesterday turned the Alauddin Sweet Meat Restaurant in Jackson Heights into makeshift fundraising headquarters for cyclone victims in Bangladesh.<br /><br />Members of the Bangladesh Society of New York and Bengali social-help group the Probashi Barisal Divisional Association covered the restaurant tables with fliers and banners encouraging help, taking to the streets of Jackson Heights to raise money for the people back home.<br /><br />The death toll from the country&#039;s most devastating storm in a decade climbed to at least 2,300 yesterday and relief officials warned the figure could jump sharply as rescuers reach more isolated areas. Tropical Cyclone Sidr struck Thursday in southwest Bangladesh, rendering much of the country without phones or electricity.<br /><br />&quot;When we heard the government announce Sidr was a No. 10, we were thinking maybe Bangladesh is going to be finished,&quot; said Mamun Rashid, 35, joint secretary of the Probashi Barisal Divisional Association, about the highest-category cyclone. &quot;Now our goal is to raise as much money as possible for the needy people there, which is basically the whole country.&quot;<br /><br />Golam Mollick, 50, a journalist at the Weekly Bengalee, said he tried to reach his sister for several days, and only yesterday received a call from her.<br /><br />&quot;She said her house was OK, but her neighbors are fisherman and many lost their boats,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#039;m sending money this week.&quot;<br /><br />Mollick says that because of flooding, his sister will not be able to operate her fishing business for weeks at least, costing her up to $3,000.<br /><br />The Barasial Divisional Association and the Bangladesh Society of New York have paired up with state Sen. John Sabini (D-Jackson Heights) and Giash Ahmed, president of the American-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce, to form a fundraising committee.<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;re just trying to get them money, fast, because the transportation costs of shipping food and supplies will outweigh the benefits,&quot; Sabini said. They join relief efforts from the Red Cross, International Red Cross and the Red Crescent.<br /><br />Standing at the corner of 74th Street and 37th Avenue, holding a brown cardboard box with &quot;donations&quot; scrawled across it in black Sharpie, Rashid points out that every cent of the relief effort counts.<br /><br />&quot;One dollar can feed four people in Bangladesh,&quot; he said, urging New Yorkers to reach out and help.<br /><br /><br /><br />

There are Greeks, Jews and many Italians who come see me to cure them of all kinds of things â€“ stomachaches, cataracts, cancer, migraines. Iâ€™ve cured them all with nature and God.â€<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Gallegoâ€™s store, which has operated in Jackson Heights for 18 years, is covered with packets of dried herbs, roots, scented candles and beads from Brazil, Spain and the Caribbean Islands. There is dandelion root for indigestion, rosemary for stress, sage for stomachaches and an array of accompanying candles meant for luck, blessings and wishes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Gallego, however, isnâ€™t the only skeptic about modern medicine in Jackson Heights. Mohsin Khan, an immigrant from Bengal who came to the United States over 30 years ago, is a firm believer in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian science of natural healing. He currently has two Ayurvedic practices in the city, one in Jackson Heights and one in Coney Island.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;His office in Jackson Heights is on 74th Street, in the heart of Little India. The modest three-room facility consists of his office, a receptionistâ€™s room and a small waiting area. â€œI have been practicing Ayurveda for 15 years. I was looking for a way to really help people after I got my masters in public health â€¦ this is really it.â€<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Kahn is a man in his 60s with white hair, a relaxed demeanor and baby-soft skin, which he swears is the result of Ayurveda. His patients seem to regard him as more of a guru than a health specialist and frequent his office as if they were stopping by to chat with a neighbor or friend.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;One of Khanâ€™s patients, Ken Overgaard, 59, of Manhattan, heard of Kahn through his pharmacist. â€œMy pharmacist said Kahn cured his painful hemorrhoids in one week when it took other doctors years to get rid of the problem. We initially went to see him because my fiancÃ©eâ€™s mother was going through dialysis. Khan cured her pain but then we stayed and he has cured my back pain too,â€ Overgaard said.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead of candles and beads used in the botanicas, Kahn prescribes herbal tonics and a holistic approach to an organic diet. â€œAll I had to do was teach Ken how to eat, and then the rest fell into place,â€ he said.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, Overgaard is so taken with Khan that he is currently financing Khanâ€™s third Ayurvedic practice in Manhattan.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Overgaard is not Kahnâ€™s only success story, though. Dilgit Singh, 51, an Indian immigrant who now lives in Jackson Heights, came to Kahn after having been to over 20 doctors.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œI have problem with sugar in my blood and have a hole in (my) foot,â€ Singh said. As he continued to speak, he pointed to his foot, which was covered in dead black skin cells, blood specks and had a hole about one-half- inch-deep in the heel.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;â€œThe hole in his foot used to be 2 inches and I made it one-half an inch through the use of herbs and organic diet,â€ said Khan as Singh nodded in agreement while putting his worn sandal back on his foot.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;While botanicas and Ayurvedic clinics are only two places to get traditional folk remedies, they are the most popular, according to resident Amelia Zanes. â€œI always go to the botanica, especially when I know the kind of illness I have and donâ€™t want to waste money at the doctor. Plus, I would rather take a bath in rosemary than eat medicine that makes me feel sick.â€<br />
