				“ Another said that for AOC, &#039;legislation was never her focus. It was media and narrative.”<br /><br />Truer words have never been spoken. It’s not really comedy gold...the problem with AOC is that she is can be obnoxious and doesn’t seem to work well with her colleagues. If she doesn’t get more savvy to the system, then she’ll never be effective. Sadly, career politicians know how to play this game. With experience, she will learn too.<br /><br />I’m just going to go ahead and say that personally, I am not a fan of AOC at all. She is all theatrics and drama all the time. I feel to my core that she loves the media attention more than she actually cares about the job or this community. :(

				<em>Another said that for AOC, &#039;legislation was never her focus. It was media and narrative.&#039; <br /></em><br /><br />So an anonymous, un-attributable quote from the right wing of the democratic party. Gotcha.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m <em>sure</em> all of the people in this thread and in voting populace, can name the &quot;effective&quot; congressmen according to the metric that this study used - how many pieces of legislation they sponsored, how they got it passed, what the bills did, RIGHT?<br /><br />Congressmembers don&#039;t just sponsor legislation. They have a bully pulpit, and most are blatherers for the status quo or corporate interests. <br /><br />---<br /><br />Look, someone has to drag this country, kicking and screaming towards justice for the poor and fucked over, and try and get the US govt to use its waning power for good.<br /><br />Someone has to try and bend government away from spending <strong>TRILLIONS, yes, TRILLIONS, of YOUR dollars every year <br /></strong> on pointless wars, locking up black and brown people and subsidizing industries that are destroying the planet for you <em>and your kids.</em><br /><br />&nbsp;Every single interview I&#039;ve seen with AOC has spoken truth in language people can understand. She takes no lobbyist cash, regularly advocates for real issues and real systemic change, and by force of will moved the conversation and priorities in the democratic party towards justice with amazing skill.<br /><br />She has advocated for striking workers in the Bronx (her district), <br />e.g. she lead the charged to repeal the faircloth amendment, which allows much needed public housing to be built<br />https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/07/02/fair-housing-advocates-celebrate-passage-aocs-repeal-faircloth-amendment<br /><br />She introduced the just society set of bills,<br />https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/ajs<br />&nbsp;versions of which have a much greater chance of being passed now the dems are in control of house, senate(barely) and the whitehouse.<br /><br />She co-sponsored 78 pieces of legislation, - 14 of which have been passed into law.<br /><br />She&#039;s relentless in congressional investigation, asking real questions to the powerful, not just scoring cheap rah-rah-America points for the camera.<br /><br />She advocated for her people in her districts: striking workers in the bronx, taxicab drivers who have been screwed over by predatory loans. She signal-boosted local COVID mutual aid networks and the Homework Helpers program (which she partially helped organize), she helped set up multilingual outreach teams for the census. <br /><br />When ted cruz fucked off to cancun, she helped raise $5m for people who had been impacted by the storm.<br /><br />She has also been a fierce advocate for the marginalized on -&nbsp; yes - twitter, and the media.<br /><br />I could go on.....<br /><br />---<br />She ALSO is the subject of the concerted efforts of the right-wing disinfo machine to <strong>destroy</strong> her. <br /><br />Because she&#039;s left wing, and brown and a woman she&#039;s relentlessly demonized by fox, newsmax etc. If you have the misfortune to watch fox, there are stories about her every day as the boogie-woman, and are mostly straight up lies. These stories are amplified all over social media have a cost.<br /><br />She has multiple, ongoing investigations about credible death threats to her.<br /><br /><strong>She&#039;s the MOST talented and real young politician I&#039;ve seen in the last two decades.<br /><br />I support her wholeheartedly.</strong><br />

				I see AOC advocating for marginalized people nationwide and in isolated cases in her district. But given her influence, I’d like to see AOC bring more benefits to the local community. <br /><br />Biden is passing a $2.3T infrastructure bill, and AOC is among the ~4 most famous Democratic voices. Ergo, bring home the bacon, please!<br /><br />AOC should draft and advocate for a set of infrastructure projects that will improve her constituents (read: our)&nbsp; lives. Maybe that’s a Triboro subway line, an LGA Airtrain alternative, or new park space. But there’s finally some serious money in play, and, love her or hate her, she’s got the attention and influence.

				&nbsp;Much of what has been stated here is true - but on both sides. She is a terrific voice for the poor and historically underserved. She does have the pulpit now. But she has also not canvassed us in the very local sense as to what might improve our neighborhoods on the macro scale. And in Florida, it is estimated that the socialist label caused a 50 pt reversal/loss of voters amongst Latin voters in a once democratic stronghold. So there is work to do and some think she walks on water and others feel disappointment. BUT if AOC is listening, please do walking, zooming and questioning tour soon and ask where some of the Build Back Better funds are most needed. <br />&nbsp; Personally, I think we could get the <strong>JH community center </strong>here that we so desperately need and deserve with these $$$.

				In her first two years of elected service, Alexandria co-sponsored 78 pieces of legislation that passed the House of Representatives and 14 bills that were signed into law. Alexandria successfully shifted $5 million in funds to treatment for opioid addiction from the DEA, secured $10 million in funds to clean up toxic bombardment sites in Vieques, Puerto Rico, banned funds going to the transfer of lethal military equipment to Bolivia, and repealed the Faircloth Amendment in the House, which paves the way for the U.S. to build more public housing for the first time in decades.<br />As a result of committee hearings, Alexandria&#039;s lines of questioning have helped: pressure Big Pharma into bringing down the price of PrEP to prevent HIV transmission; expose TransDigm, a defense contractor, into returning $16.1 million in price-gouged profits to the public; pressure Facebook on fact-checking political advertising and expose Mark Zuckerberg’s dinner parties with radical right-wing figures; to get President Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen to state on the record that President Trump was engaging in tax fraud and to name other potential witnesses; and overturned the unjust citizenship question on the Census.<br />At home in The Bronx and Queens, Alexandria and her congressional team helped over 1000 constituents with the VA, Social Security, immigration visas and other federal services, attended over 600 events in the district, and hosted 25 town halls. Alexandria was nominated for two Democracy Awards, the first time a Member of Congress was recognized in two categories, for Workplace Environment and Innovation &amp; Modernization. She also called for the bailout for taxi cab drivers targeted in predatory lending schemes and tougher oversight of New York City taxi medallion lending.<br />When NY-14 became the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, Alexandria and Team AOC mobilized a full relief operation response that made 200,000 community check in calls, distributed 80,000 meals and 100,000 masks to teachers, small businesses, essential workers, and families in need, and raised $1.25 million for local organizations and charities doing COVID-19 relief. As the pandemic worsened, Alexandria introduced and passed the COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Act, alongside Sen. Chuck Schumer, which will help families get up to $9K in funeral expenses who lost loved ones to the coronavirus. The campaign also hosted 8 training sessions to teach over 10,000 people how to unionize their workplaces, form mutual aid networks and childcare collectives, and more during the pandemic. In October, as COVID rates spiked again and NYC schools closed, Team AOC organized and launched a Homework Helpers program that has recruited over 11,000 tutors to offer 1-on-1 help for kids in remote learning. While the pandemic surged, Alexandria also led a multilingual outreach effort on the Census, which brought in over $58 million to NY-14.<br />

				Many thanks to lalochezia &amp; Dssjh for listing some of the concrete accomplishments of AOC.&nbsp; <br />She has the entire GOP quaking in their boots, and frankly I am happy she is there, even if she is simply a disrupter, but I believe she is much,much more than that. <br />I am finding that as I get older, I am becoming more and more lefty in my opinions.&nbsp; <br />I want to wish her good health, and a long run as my representative. <br />

				I think the &quot;ineffective&quot; moniker is just spin. The cited study from the Center for Effective Lawmaking simply lists effective politicians based on a set of criteria that they very clearly lay out. The report never mentions AOC nor calls her ineffective. It simply shows that according to their criteria she comes at near the bottom of their list of effective lawmakers, i.e. those who author and pass legislation. I vote for her because I used to live in Sunnyside and she is a &quot;real person&quot; but that doesn&#039;t mean she isn&#039;t &quot;really annoying&quot; when she gets her taste of celebrity.

(No free enterprise here if it affects the proletariat.) She wants “open borders” which would totally alter everyones way of life in this country economically ( except the billionaires). (Doesn’t she have a degree in economics?). (And would be the communist chinese wet dream) She wants to “defund the police”. which is not the way to fix the problems that we have. It’s just a way to incite more problems. She needs a lesson in making slogans. But saying defund the police is an easy way to pander to the proletariat.&nbsp; (I am not saying we do not have problems with the police.&nbsp; I am saying that making broad nonsense slogans incites the problems and plays into her opponents hands.)&nbsp; None of this seems woke, just 1920’s commie.

Eisenhower was not against large stores. Didn’t malls start around that time?<br /><br />Eisenhower built infrastructure that gave people jobs, like a mini FDR. Eisenhower was a general; he did not say defund the police. He was not someone who helped “minorities”. ( In quotes because that is what people used to say. ) He kept the status quo.&nbsp; Jim crow, redlining....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />He did not make wild claims, no rabble rousing slogans. He kept social things the way they were, but made infrastructure improvements.&nbsp; He provided for the soldiers of World War II, while “keeping people in their place.” <br /><br />After World War II, we did not have an exemplary record allowing war affected immigrants to come here. I don’t know if that was more Truman than Eisenhower. I see Eisenhower more as a tepid (after ww2) peacemaker or placater.&nbsp; <br /><br />AOC states things in an exaggerated way. She could learn from her opponents who cloak things in patriotic terms which appeal to their base. Freedom this, opportunity that... not no police so we have murders on every street corner, or let everyone move here so you lose your job. Eisenhower had a dad or grandfather vibe, not the annoying sister who you want to avoid at Thanksgiving.

				The irony, of course, is that one and all flock to (and those born here stay in) the USA with the dream of &quot;making it&quot;.<br /><br />Economically.<br /><br />In other words, becoming wealthy.<br /><br />It&#039;s the dream that the poor and the middle class, the immigrant and the non immigrant, share. <br /><br />The American Dream.<br /><br />A dream that unites Americans.<br /><br />The American Dream is fundamentally pretty much at odds with other agendas. <br /><br />
