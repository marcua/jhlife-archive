				I didn&#039;t watch the debate, but I did get a ridiculous campaign flyer from MCC today.&nbsp; I&#039;m not the biggest AOC fan, but I respect her conviction and overall beliefs.&nbsp; This flyer was from her &quot;Democratic&quot; primary opponent, quoting articles from the National Review and Washington Examiner, two highly conservative rags.&nbsp; While National Review has history of being reasonable/intellectual conservatism, it is not that anymore.&nbsp; The Washington Examiner is Fox News-ish, with articles from today like &quot;Ivanka Trump&#039;s Commencement Speech was Cancelled because Social Justice is a Disease.&quot;&nbsp; The articles quoted talked about how AOC was hiding in her luxury DC condo, which they went out of their way to stress, &#039;doesn&#039;t let poor people in&#039;.&nbsp; I&#039;m so tired of this stupid narrative that Democrats who care about social justice can&#039;t live in luxury condos or something like that.&nbsp; And by &#039;not letting poor people in&#039; they were saying there aren&#039;t subsidized units like there are in many NYC developments.<br /><br />I&#039;d absolutely welcome a legitimate Democratic primary challenger to AOC, but MCC isn&#039;t that.&nbsp; I&#039;d almost certainly have voted for AOC anyway, but MCC&#039;s flyer sealed the deal for me.

				i&#039;ve been getting her mailers, too. they&#039;re borderline hysterical (and i don&#039;t mean in terms of humor) with the Over! The! Top! scare tactics and Exclamation! Points! the gist? AOC hates poor people and only exists to serve the moneyed classes, since she doesn&#039;t live in a tenement.

				Yeah, dssjh, today&#039;s had a picture of AOC on the front looking like a crazy person, and the flip side was MCC standing alongside healthcare workers, as though somehow those are the options: a bad person who hates the poor, and a good person who cares about nurses.<br /><br />Again, I like AOC overall but I&#039;m not a die-hard supporter and would absolutely consider voting for someone else in the primary, but you&#039;re right that MCC is hysterical in a not-funny way.

				I&#039;m undecided but have to point out that MCC is running an aggressive campaign and AOC seems to be asleep at the wheel. I&#039;ve not received a single thing from the AOC campaign in my mailbox, whereas MCC sends 1-2 pieces per week and runs TV spots. At this point given the uncertainty about voter turnout, I would not be totally surprised if AOC gets upset in the primary in much the same way she had upset the Joe Crowley campaign.

				MCC is definitely flush with campaign cash. I&#039;ve received three calls from &quot;pollsters&quot; who are actually consultants testing out anti-AOC messaging, and have stopped counting the number of hysterical mailers showing up in my post box. It&#039;s all so cynical. I enjoy putting those mailers through the shredder.
