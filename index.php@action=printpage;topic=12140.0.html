				The newly renovated Kitchen79 is open.&nbsp; It is in the space that was formerly Arunee.&nbsp; They are in the process of getting their liquor license.&nbsp; Their website is www.kitchen79nyc.com&nbsp; I talked to one of the owners and she is extremely nice.&nbsp;

				<br />Looking forward to trying, they definately made an effort with the decor, which is always a pleasure to see, and will hopefully inspire new restaurants in our &#039;hood&nbsp; to do the same :)<br /><br />Check out their facebook pg for pics: kitchen 79<br />

				Just ate lunch there. Very nice! Food was flavorful and nicely presented. I had a yummy won-ton for an appetizer and chicken in green curry all for about $8.50. Decor is not my style -- very shiny and silver and black and white -- but it is stylish and a step above most of what you see in the area. Took a takeout menu to alert others in the building...we have a plethora of Thai riches and i couldn&#039;t be happier since it is one of my favorite cuisines...

				We had it for delivery tonight.<br />The breakdown --<br />Looking at the menu, they have some Thai dishes that the others in our delivery range don&#039;t, seemingly from southern Thailand.<br />We had:<br />Po pia sod: Veggies were nice and crisp in the spring roll. Thankfully the included tamarind sauce was there because it would have been uber-bland otherwise.<br />Yum ma mong: a mango salad with shrimp, cashew nut, red onion, chili and scallion. A nice mix of flavors, but it was definitely mild compared to the som tum dishes in the area.<br />Gauy tiew nam tok moo: We wanted to try it to gauge it against Ayada, as their version is arguably our favorite thing on the menu there. It had a heat theirs lacks, but wasn&#039;t quite as well-rounded. Still, a pretty good rendition that&#039;s a notch below, but behind.<br />Kua klong moo: That heat we were expecting from the mango salad? It was in this dish in spades. Curry and herbs with ground pork and lime leaves. The curry heat concentrated down as there isn&#039;t really a sauce in this dish. The pork was nicely cooked, but this dish had a definite lingering burn. I&#039;d have it again, but it&#039;s definitely on the short list of spicy dishes I&#039;ve had in the last couple years.<br /><br />Overall, Ayada&#039;s going to remain the No. 1 go-to, but the overall quality of our first go-round, along with the fact that there are some dishes on their menu that aren&#039;t available from the others, probably puts this place at No. 2 ahead of Arunee and well ahead of Black Thai.<br />KUA KLING&nbsp; MOO / <br />

				Just checked this place out tonight and really enjoyed it. The lady couldn&#039;t have been nicer and the decor is quite elegant and a HUGE change from the old Arunee space that used to be here. <br /><br />As mentioned earlier, many of the options are Southern Thai, a nice change of pace from the Northern Thai that can be found often. Now for the run down of what we ordered: <br /><br />KA NOM JEEN GANG KIEW WARN GAI (Thai Pasta with Chicken, Basil Leaves, Eggplant <br />and Coconut Milk in Green Curry) - Really enjoyed this one, the green curry and coconut milk mix was excellent and had a nice amount of heat to it.<br /><br />PAD PED MOO PHA (Sauté Wild Boar with Young Pepper, Mixed Vegetable and Mix in Chili Sauce) - First time seeing wild boar on a Thai menu, so this was a must-order. This dish really stood out - nice amount of heat and complex layers of flavor with galangal and green peppercorns. <br /><br />PLAH SALMON (Grilled Filleted Salmon Salad with Mints, Lemongrass and Herbs in Red Chili Paste) - Refreshing and light dish, although I felt that there could have been a bit more lemongrass in it. <br /><br />The mango sticky rice was quite tasty - very fresh ripe mangos and a nice presentation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looking forward to checking out more of the dishes and the lunch special looks great, as you can choose from a long list of appetizers to go along with the main (rather than the appetizer just being a toss-in). <br /><br />No liquor license yet, but the lady said that it should be coming shortly. She was very accommodating and said that we could BYOB if we liked. A big positive is that there looked like some nice draft beer taps including Long Trail (!!). <br /><br />Really hope they succeed and highly recommend checking it out. <br />

				I ordered from them tonight, via Seamless, and I&#039;m sad to say I was a little disappointed. Delivery was quick, which is a plus, but the food was just ok. <br />Some of the stuff, like the chicken seemed like it wasn&#039;t fresh. Both the white rice and the fried rice were hard and dry. The chicken dumplings were good, and the dish I had, the Phad Kratiem was pretty good. Overall, it was better than Black Thai, but I thought Arunee was better (if not for service) and it&#039;s nowhere near Sripraphai. <br />I really wanted to love this place. I&#039;m hoping the long holiday weekend is the reason they were off, and hopefully they&#039;ll be better the next time.

				I got delivery from here tonight (I called directly, and had no problem placing the order).&nbsp; I thought the Guay Tiew Pad Kee Mau and Mango Salad were particularly good.&nbsp; &nbsp;My only complaint is that the portions for the Nuea Yaan (grilled tender beef) were quite small like an appetizer -- if I had known I would have ordered something different or an additional dish.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, I was pleased and will definitely be a return customer.&nbsp; They&#039;ll have stiff competition from all of the other amazing Thai places around, but they&#039;re off to a good start.

				I had the pad kaprow for lunch; it was quite good- I&#039;ll definitely go back to sample offerings from the full dinner menu. As others have mentioned, they&#039;re waiting on a liquor license, so they&#039;ll have beer, wine, and sake soon. The staff were all really warm- it was sadly pretty empty went in; I hope others will give this place a try!

				Well, I did indeed try them again, and I&#039;m pleased to say it was much better the second time around. Everything tasted fresher and just better. Maybe it was what I ordered. I&#039;m very happy to get a Thai place that delivers to me (and quickly!) that serves up good, affordable food. <br /><br />One question for Thai &quot;experts&quot; - I had the fried calamari, which I always like and it was very good here. Every Thai place in NYC seems to serve up this dish. Is it actually an authentic Thai dish that would be served in Thailand, or is it Americanized for our tastes? Just curious.

I would say it&#039;s more common with shrimp in the same style though. Some Thai people would associate this more with Chinese food as it is usually served with plum sauce, sweet and sour but not spicy (no chili).<br /><br />Too bad, I have never tried the same dish in the US so I do not know if it&#039;s Americanized. I have learned the hard way how Americanized pad thai is.

Herbs and condiments taste different here too. <br /><br />To me, American pad thai is generally bad because of poor stir-fry technique, incomplete ingredients (no hard tofu, dried shrimp, or banana flower), and substitutes for tamarind and palm sugar.

				gotta say I was a bit skeptical.&nbsp; Figured we already had a ton of Thai places and really good ones at that.&nbsp; Why one more?&nbsp; But we ordered in from them last night and it was great and not exactly like the others.&nbsp; My knowledge of Thai food by region isn&#039;t good enough to know the exact differences but, in particular, the Gaeng Massaman was one of the best dishes I&#039;ve tried recently (and everything else was great as well).

The décor is sleek—black and white chairs, black walls, a black-and-white-patterned floor and chandeliers.<br /><br />The menu makes a mark, too. Diners get an appetizer and an entree, the lunch special, for one price: $7.50 for chicken, tofu or vegetable, and $8.50 for shrimp or beef.<br /><br />Unlike many places that offer only soup or salad as lunch appetizers, Kitchen 79 offers seven—soup and salad, of course, but also fried tofu with sweet chili sauce; a pastry pocket stuffed with curried chicken, potato and onion; and steamed or fried dumplings filled with chicken, for example.<br /><br />The traditional pad thai—rice noodles with bean sprouts, egg, scallion and peanuts—is the entree recommendation of co-owner Thawatchai Thadchan. The phad prik sod is made with chili, long hot pepper, onion and scallion. Other dishes include fried rice, green and red curries, and a couple of kinds of noodles.</em>

				Finally made it the other night. The space is awesome and the owner was so warm and inviting. And the food&#039;s flavor was everything Thai cooking should be; proper spice but doesn&#039;t overwhelm all the other nuisances of the dishes. <br /><br />Quality blows Arunee away and is actually welcoming. Its&nbsp; great to have a southern Thai place to augment the central and northern places in Elmhurst. <br /><br />Not sure why she is waiting so long for her liquor license, but nice that its BYOB for time being.

				79 is Superior these days. Arunee in its new space has slipped alas; it has gone somewhat western flavored-thai. When we went last week, t he food reminded me some of the mediocre thai stuff in hell&#039;s kitchen .<br /><br />We order takeout from 79 all the time; fresh, complex spicing, good stuff.<br /><br />

				Wife and I went to Thai 79 the other day for lunch and it was great.&nbsp; Staff is very helpful and food was out of sight, much better than Arunee Thai

				Last week there was a handful of beers. I also think there was wine, sake and sangria.
