					When I’ve chatted to non-driving friends outside the neighborhood about the possible creation of a linear park, the typical reaction has been, “That’s amazing — it’ll be so nice to have that space so close by” followed by, “What are they going to do with the street? Will there be food trucks and plants and stuff?”<br /><br />My assumption is that this is good for property values for those close to, but not on, 34th Ave — especially if they cater to the preferences of people with money in redesigning the open street. So pretty trees, art installations, and bougie vendors with attractive dedicated seating areas are going to be much better than the current arrangement.

They must match the paint color , shape etc... To the best of my knowledge, these types of custom windows are very expensive. It must vary from building to building, but the client I have in the Chateau redid his windows at his own expense, it was not an all-building project. <br /><br />you can see the windows in the listing: <a href="https://corenyc.com/property/34-37-80th-st-52-3212927/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">https://corenyc.com/property/34-37-80th-st-52-3212927/</a><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That would explain the inconsistency. But Armen, from the looks of it, your client’s windows swing open on hinges rather than raise with sliders like other windows on the building. Perhaps there’s a bit more flexibility there on the part of the landmark rule keepers that could enable replacements that are either less costly or more functional.

					Each Chateau building is a separate coop, and I’ve also noticed that the quality of the windows (in particular the paint, but storm windows, too) varies by building. Perhaps erecting scaffolding just to strip and repaint only to solve for a cosmetic problem is a tall order. But I’d certainly get an estimate if I were a resident.&nbsp; <br /><br />Meanwhile, the Greystones (also separate coops, albeit less ritzy) seem to have spiffier, fresh green paint. Perhaps they can recommend a contractor to the Chateau’s management company!<br /><br /><br /><br />

					Washington Plaza seems like a different vibe compared to coops in the high-70s/low-80s closer to 34th Ave, both in surroundings and style. I assume the “bones” are befitting a rental vs. the quality of Towers, Chateau, or Hawthorne Court — all 3 of which have sold or gone into contract at $900k+ for a 3-4 bedroom flat. <br /><br />I have no clue what typical supply looks like, but this year, fewer than 10 of these larger apartments have hit the market, so owners must be sticking with the neighborhood.<br /><br />My 2c: for NYC professionals commuting less often that want great restaurants, a hip community, city access, and an easy trip to LGA for weekend getaways, this is the place. I’m just surprised they’re not putting their 1BR Manhattan shoe boxes on the market and moving here.

					We shall see, though I’m also hearing that deal activity has picked up, especially as NYC recovers more quickly than some other areas. I’m a believer that the same cultural forces that have been attracting people to cities for decades will rapidly overcome pandemic headwinds. <br /><br />Also, the suburbs have gotten so expensive so quickly — Jackson Heights becomes the not-so-hidden gem that can offer a best-of-both-worlds appeal. Who’s even leaving (and selling) given these possible dynamics?

					In the past couple weeks I’ve seen several co-ops listed and go into contract, even in the higher price points of $900k+. And a few of these deals happened FAST, like within two weeks of listing. It looks like some buyers know what they’re looking for and are eager to move in.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the country, real estate is going for 20%+ over pre-pandemic prices, while here in Jackson Heights it still seems a bit lower than before. Yet the nicer Jackson Heights co-ops have many of the benefits of suburbs (space, community feel, gardens) coupled with urban appeals.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />So, what’s the outlook? A new crop of young professionals moving in? Prices rising quickly as Jackson Heights takes on more of a Park Slope/Prospect Heights vibe? Yuppies spoiling the neighborhood? Omakase sushi? A subsequent drop in prices if many new sellers emerge?<br /><br />

					Once everyone who wants to get vaccinated has done so, then it’ll make sense to reduce precautions. That way, everyone has gotten the chance to make their choice about how careful they want to be, while recognizing that once you’re as protected as possible, you have to return to a more normal life (unless you intend to continue living with those precautions forever). <br /><br />Let’s hope mid-May is the ticket!

					Over time, mask guidance has evolved, but one concern has always been that frequently touching masks negates the benefits and can even increase exposure to germs (dirty hands touch dirty faces and then other people or surfaces and so on). The younger the child, the more likely they are to fiddle with their masks (and they’re unlikely to be infected or contagious anyway). <br /><br />But realistically, given what the community has been through, their typical political leanings, and the trust placed in Dr. Fauci, I don’t expect any change until Fauci makes a call. And that will be based on some mixture of science, public health intuition, and politicking. I would guess it doesn’t change until 2022 but would love for things to move faster in alignment with mass vaccination.

					This seems like a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Nice to see some more upscale drinking-forward establishments joining the local bars. <br /><br />And I’m glad we’ll have a way to get local brews without venturing all over the borough.

					I see AOC advocating for marginalized people nationwide and in isolated cases in her district. But given her influence, I’d like to see AOC bring more benefits to the local community. <br /><br />Biden is passing a $2.3T infrastructure bill, and AOC is among the ~4 most famous Democratic voices. Ergo, bring home the bacon, please!<br /><br />AOC should draft and advocate for a set of infrastructure projects that will improve her constituents (read: our)&nbsp; lives. Maybe that’s a Triboro subway line, an LGA Airtrain alternative, or new park space. But there’s finally some serious money in play, and, love her or hate her, she’s got the attention and influence.

					I also managed to snag one by constantly refreshing the vax4nyc page until I found a nearby appointment. New appointments seemingly appear every 15 minutes, with larger batches on the hour. PITA, but worth monitoring. <br /><br />I just wish there were a way to trade your appointment with someone else to get closer to home. Many appointments that pop up are in the Bronx or Staten Island, and I assume some folks from those boroughs found their appointment in Queens.
