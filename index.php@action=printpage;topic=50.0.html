				Well hello all. <br /><br />I grew up in Jackson Heights but make my home in Astoria now.&nbsp; Found this forum through our own Astorians.com site and since I never did post in the &quot;Hello&quot; thread there, I&#039;d make up for it by starting one here.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m a home improvement contractor (not a plug) and part time super in my building.&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss the Sizzler and the Archer Store across from it, along with Record Room on 82nd St, and the Hobby Hut on 83rd.&nbsp; Glad to see Jahn&#039;s is still holding on and played darts a few times over at Budds.<br /><br />See, I don&#039;t know what to say.&nbsp; Which is probably why I never posted on the &quot;Hello&quot; thread in Astoria.<br /><br />Congrats to you all on your new forum.&nbsp; Hope it is addictive as our own is. :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;Have fun.

				If this is a &quot;hello&quot; thread- I will say hello too.<br /><br />I am Shelby2.&nbsp; I chose my username after the small town of Shelby, Montana, where my dad lived once upon a time when he was growing up.&nbsp; Even though I&#039;m originally from Massachusetts and my dad is from the west, my mother&#039;s family is from right here in Queens. My mother was born in Flushing; my grandmother graduated from Hunter College High in 1918, and I had a great aunt living in Elmhurst and another one living in Whitestone.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in Jackson Heights for almost two years and Brooklyn before that.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the arts and am finding more and more that JH is a great neighborhood for people in this field.<br /><br />I&#039;m also on the Astorians forum so I guess we&#039;ll see each other here and there.<br /><br />

				Hello Jackson Heights! I spent my unguided youth hanging out in JH. Most of my friends lived there. I am in Astoria. I graduated W. C. Bryant High School in 1961. Yes, I AM old! I wish you as much success with this forum as we at astorians.com (http://www.astorians.com/) have had. Remember, the Help button at the top of each page is your friend, and the Spell Check button saves a lot of embarrassment! Spread the word about jacksonheightslife.com (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/) to all your online friends and neighbors.

				Hi.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been living at the east end of Woodside for about six months.&nbsp; I&#039;ve lived in every borough of NYC throughout my life (all 46 years) and grew up in The Bronx.&nbsp; Although I technically live in Woodside (64th St.), I spend a lot of time around the 73rd-75th Street area (for Indian food and music, great supermarkets, the nice and fast E train...), so I kind of feel as though I am resident of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />I arrived here via a Jackson Heights blog that I discovered because they linked to some reviews that I wrote about some CDs that I&#039;d bought in one of the stores on 74th Street.&nbsp; I do a blog on global electronic music, among other things.&nbsp; (Maybe I&#039;ll send the URL for that...sometime.)&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m looking forward to getting more deeply acquainted with the neighborhood.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had to move a lot lately (bad apartment luck), but I&#039;d like to settle in the Jackson Heights area for a while.<br /><br />

				HIIIIIII<br /><br />I&#039;m Jen. I came from Astorians.com too. I live in neither astoria nor jackson heights. I&#039;m from Sunnyside, but we don&#039;t have a forum&nbsp; :( But I spend most of my leisure time in Astoria as it&#039;s where I went to hs &amp; jhs and got familiar with and am comfy. I also spend time in JH as several extremely close friends live there, and I know the neighborhood rather well. I can&#039;t wait for this site to get all full of ppl and posts like astorians.com<br /><br />sunnyside.com next? maybe just 1110.com? That&#039;d be cool.

				Howdy&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;m Andrew. Born and raised in Jackson Heights (OK well I was born in St. Vincnet&#039;s Hospital, but they brought me home to JH just as soon as they could). <br /><br />Grew up here, went to PS 69, IS 145, an did a stint in Astoria @ Bryant High School (Class of &#039;93). Nice to see a fellow alum on here&nbsp; NYCMacUser.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I worked in film and theatre production for a long time, and after a 4 year gig @ Queens Theatre in the Park I left the world of arts administration to be a teaching artist. I can, at times, be found at the Renaissance Charter School (founded by my 4th grade teacher) creating theatre with the 9th, 10th, and 11th graders. If you&#039;re curious to see what I do, we made a documentary about a year ago: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hufzu2ylAo (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hufzu2ylAo)<br /><br />I&#039;m having a great time rediscovering my neighborhood, I&#039;ve found a new network of friends, some great bars&nbsp; ;), and have been getting a little more involved in the political scene. I&#039;m happy we have a place online to share ides and keep on eye on JH&#039;s next (or current) transition.&nbsp; &nbsp;

If you were ever down there during christmas you&#039;d recognize my house because my mom added so many lights that she could land planes...<br /><br />I come from a theater background but I moved to Fl for a year to study film from the school of life. I came back and lived in Woodside for a year where I made this short:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2353Ecfd5s (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2353Ecfd5s)<br /><br />My mom after many christmas&#039;s past decided to move to PA and in turn I now rent out her 1st floor. I am back home again.<br />My biggest accomplishments would have to be my first Doc that I got interview for....<br /><br />http://h.zeitbyte.com/o1/altvnetwork/latination/index.html?videoName=altvnetwork/latination/flv/lnm_Second_position<br />&nbsp;(http://h.zeitbyte.com/o1/altvnetwork/latination/index.html?videoName=altvnetwork/latination/flv/lnm_Second_position)<br /><br />I actually have worked with a few fellow forum member here (ARonan). I have tried my best to stumble through an at home production company I run where my former bedroom use to be. <br /><br />I made friends with other local filmmaker especially my best friend who is the owners son from the transfer shop in Woodside (RK Video)...<br />http://www.fftlproductions.com/commercials.html (http://www.fftlproductions.com/commercials.html)<br /><br />...but I am always looking to make more...<br /><br />I currently work filming programs/workshops and performances for Queens Theater in the Park and occasionally teach theater or film for afterschool programs. <br /><br />If you ever see me in the street just say hi! I&#039;m always usually wearing a fedora hat... <br />Hope to see you guys around!

I regret that I haven&#039;t found this website earlier, cause I&#039;ve spent the whole vacations on Jackson Heights. 37Th Ave&nbsp; 81st street. I truly enjoyed every single day on Jackson Heights&nbsp; ;D I don&#039;t know when will I come for another time but maybe next summer, I hope. In my opinion 37Th Ave. is so cool;) especially the stores between 81st and 78Th street :). <br /><br />Oh, and guys I have a question.

				I just want to introduce myself to everyone within this forum.&nbsp; I lived in Jackson Heights my entire life (28 years) minus some years for college.&nbsp; My parents purchased their 82nd Street home when I was barely walking.&nbsp; I must say many things have changed in both positives and negatives within JH and its surrounding areas.&nbsp; I mainly grew up playing in my parentsâ€™ backyard or at the local parks (78th and 34th, 85th and 30th) and running to Joeâ€™s Candy Store on Northern and 85th.&nbsp; I learned a lot growing up in JH. I learned not to leave your bike leaning on the front steps while eating ice cream 2 feet away from it (some guy hopped on it and took off, I was 13&nbsp; :&#039;().&nbsp; But most importantly I learned about diversity, culture, respect and street smarts. <br /><br />I went to PS148, IS145 &amp; Long Island City HS before moving to a SUNY Upstate NY university.&nbsp; To be honest I never really looked in the history and background of Jackson Heights until the past year or so.&nbsp; I must say I have learned a lot and learned to look up at the detailed buildings more often.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like all neighborhoods JH has its positive and negative cycles.&nbsp; I remember back in the early 90â€™s when I couldnâ€™t walk home from IS145 without a gang of kids asking me for a quarter (I never gave up a dime).&nbsp; During that same time the local park grounds were littered with broken malt liquor bottles and graffiti filled the benches and handball courts.&nbsp; Now, I noticed that the area became a lot better.&nbsp; Business owners on Northern seem to care more about the people in front of their establishments.&nbsp; I also noticed that IS145 now requires khaki bottoms and a white top which is a great idea.&nbsp; This eliminates a student going home shirtless since he has a trendier shirt that a bully wanted.<br /><br />I didnâ€™t mean to create a multi paragraph introduction but I have a lot of thoughts and opinions when it comes to the neighborhood I spent my youth in.&nbsp; To cut this short, I want to say that this is a great online forum filled with people that have car and concern when it comes to Jackson Heights.&nbsp; If there are any questions please let me know. Thanks&nbsp; :)<br />

				Hello! I just found this site and discovered the &quot;any long time jackson heighters out there&quot; thread.&nbsp; I was born in the Heights and lived there for 41 years, until 12 years ago.<br /><br />I&#039;m getting nostalgic now hearing about all the places that I went to while growing up and as an adult.<br /><br />I used to hang out at Northern Lanes bowling alley on 75th &amp; Northern---we lived right behind the parking lot. My friends and I &quot;owned&quot; the place until it closed.<br /><br />Used to work at the grandly named &quot;Jackson Heights Institute for Music and Dancing&quot; on 82nd Street between 37th &amp; Roosevelt. I worked there when Larry Downes was a guitar instructor there, before he opened his own place on 37th Ave. I would love to get in touch with him again.<br /><br />My brother owned &quot;Arts &#039;n Flowers&quot; florist on the corner of 81st and 37th. The whole family always helped out on the holidays and we got to know so many people in the area.<br /><br />Went to PS 69, and then the first year of 6th grade ever at IS 145. That year there were 2 graduating classes at PS 69 - 6th graders and 5th graders. I felt like pioneer.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been checking out the google street views of the neighborhood and I&#039;m astonished at all the changes. <br /><br />Hope to be part of this community and maybe reconnect.

				Just thought I would formally introduce myself here. I moved to Jackson Heights with my husband &amp; our daughter in October from Michigan. I&#039;m a librarian &amp; I work for Queens Library (feel free to contact me with all your library questions, comments &amp; complaints, I am happy to try &amp; help). My husband&#039;s an archivist &amp; our daughter is finishing up 6th grade at IS 230. I am originally from Manhattan &amp; my dad &amp; stepmom still live there.<br />We moved to Jackson Heights primarily for its wonderful diversity &amp; central location in Queens &amp; every day I find one more reason I love Jackson Heights &amp; Queens in general.<br />Hope to meet some of you face to face for the July restaurant thing...it sounds like fun.

				Hi Joe ! Welcome !<br /><br />While the early evening bar scene in JH is lacking there are a couple of spots that might suit your needs.<br /><br />Novo on 37th Ave. bet 78 &amp; 79 has a decent happy hour and good bar tender (Brian) on Mondays and Tuesdays.<br /><br />Terraza 7 Train Cafe on Glean St. just off Roosevelt Ave &amp; 83rd St. is small, funky, and fun.<br /><br />Legends on 72nd St. and 35th has draft beer, and old style townie bar feel, and GREAT barbecue (except on Tuesdays)<br /><br />Cassidy&#039;s on 75th and 31st Ave. lots of beer options and food.<br /><br />Jardi on Northern and 86th St. Good Sangia and GREAT Tappas.<br /><br />These are the places where I go most often, I am sure there are a couple more. Certainly there are a few folks out there with places to add to the list.

				Hello Everybody!! I posted here once before that my wife and I were moving to Jackson Heights and everybody welcomed us..Thank you.&nbsp; We finally moved in 3 weeks ago.<br /><br />I asked a question about bars in the area and how we liked to go out early (happy hour times) and be home early (We are lame).&nbsp; I read a few past posts and the only places that seem to have what we are looking for are Legends, Cassidy&#039;s and the Ready Penny Inn.<br />I wouldn&#039;t consider us beer snobs but I do like a better selection then the usual belly wash I been reading these places serve. Are there any other suggestions or is that it for now.<br /><br />Hopefully it gets better. I lived in Williamsburg my whole life and with easy access to the city and then the area chinging itself, I got a little spoiled.<br />

				not really a beer snob area, for better or worse. a dear friend who works as a vintner in oregon gave a reasonably warm review to novo for wines by the glass; delhi heights bartender actually makes a decent martini and other mixed drinks (with a nibble or two thrown in). but as far as hoppiness? sorry, i am baffled.

				Hi. &nbsp;I&#039;ve been living at the east end of Woodside for about six months. &nbsp;I&#039;ve lived in every borough of NYC throughout my life (all 46 years) and grew up in The Bronx. &nbsp;Although I technically live in Woodside (64th St.), I spend a lot of time around the 73rd-75th Street area (for Indian food and music, great supermarkets, the nice and fast E train...), so I kind of feel as though I am resident of Jackson Heights.<br />I arrived here via a Jackson Heights blog that I discovered because they linked to some reviews that I wrote about some CDs that I&#039;d bought in one of the stores on 74th Street. &nbsp;I do a blog on global electronic music, among other things. &nbsp;(Maybe I&#039;ll send the URL for that...sometime.) &nbsp;Anyway, I&#039;m looking forward to getting more deeply acquainted with the neighborhood. &nbsp;I&#039;ve had to move a lot lately (bad apartment luck), but I&#039;d like to settle in the Jackson Heights area for a while.<br /><br /><strong>[Moderator&#039;s note: spam links removed]</strong><br /><br />

I&#039;d love to chat. I&#039;m 6&#039;2&quot;, Caucasian, with brown hair and glasses. And I&#039;ll probably have a dorky messenger back with me. <br /><br />See you around!<br /><br />~Richard

				Hi! <br />I&#039;m a graduate student at Columbia University studying journalism.&nbsp; For my graduate work I have been assigned to write about Peruvian-Americans. I heard there were plenty of Peruvian restaurants and even some clubs in Jackson Heights so I was hoping to find some leads for stories in this community. Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; I&#039;m also looking for any story that sounds interesting, unique, or that has been overlooked by other New York newspapers.&nbsp; Email me at NathanAVickers@gmail.com if you have any ideas!<br />

				Hello all! &nbsp;My name is Whitney Light; I&#039;m in Jackson Heights this year as a student reporter from the Columbia School of Journalism. I&#039;m from Winnipeg, Canada, and I just arrived to New York City in late July. I&#039;m thrilled to have been assigned Jackson Heights as my neighborhood beat, which I will cover for The Metropolitan Monitor (a publication of Columbia; more details on that soon) and local news outlets. I will frequently be out in the community doing research and gathering story ideas. If you would like to send me a story idea--could be news, culture, business, life, people, etc--please feel free to send me an email. My address is wml2106@columbia.edu.<br /><br />One of my first assignments in August was to create a 2-minute audio slideshow, and for it I worked with Margarita Bermejo, a longtime JH resident, to create a story about her experiences as an immigrant, mother and small business person. You can check it out here: https://vimeo.com/48622879<br /><br />Thanks and I look forward hearing from some of you and to getting to better know your neighborhood. <br /><br />Whitney
