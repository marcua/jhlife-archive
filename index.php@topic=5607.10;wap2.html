			I&#039;ve lived here all my life. 1941-1963 at 34-20 83rd St, then on 80th between 34th and 35th from 1965-present.<br /><br />My father had a bunch of plots in the victory gardens behind Saint Marks Church.<br /><br />I went to St. Marks and still do.<br /><br />Mine is a small world.<br /><br />The number of interesting stores has almost disappeared. I think most people just go into Manhattan to work and shop there.<br /><br />Travers Park between 77th and 78th is still the only playground, but the city has 1. Demapped 78th between Northern and 34th Ave for a PlayStreet, and 2. bought the Garden School playing field for a park. So there will be, hopefully, some greenspace and full-time park space from 79th St to 77th between Northern and 34th.<br /><br />Alex Pizza on 37th turned into Romeo Pizza turned into the current Gustosa Pizza. Opposite PS 69.<br /><br />The Boulevard Theater is now the Boulevard restaurant. The Jackson Theater is now the Jackson Cinema, showing Hollywood and Bollywood movies and the Colony Theater is now stores.<br /><br />Jahn&#039;s is still there. Carroll Pharmacy is now Taco Bell. Dragon Seed, Cavalier and any decent bar hangouts are gone.<br /><br />That&#039;s all for now.<br />

			Hi Folks-<br /><br />My 91 year old mother lived in Jackson Heights at 127 Hawthorne Court when she was in public school so that would have been in the 1920s. Her father was a pediatrician and had an office attached to their main floor garden apartment. We live in Canada now. Does that address still exist? Does anyone have info or pictures? My mom&#039;s short term memory is really poor but she has sweet stories of her youth there. Thanks to anyone who has info to share.

			<strong>Beech Court</strong>:
			<br />
			The 14 buildings called Hawthorne Court were built in 1922 for the Queensboro Corporation by George H. Wells, architect. In those years the original street numbers and names were different. They were changed later to fit in with the grid numbers of the surrounding neigborhoods.<br /><br />Originally building number 127 Hawthorne Court was in the middle of the block on the West side of 20th Street between Polk and Fillmore Avenues. In the renumbering of the streets the addresses also changed accordingly. Today 127 20 Street is now called 35-34 77th Street between 37th (Polk) and 35th (Fillmore) Avenues. There is no 36th Avenue.<br /><br />We&#039;d love to hear some of your mother&#039;s stories!
