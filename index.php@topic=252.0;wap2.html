			Can anyone recommend a good place(s) to buy high quality bread, i.e. soft on the inside crusty on the outside, and whole wheat?<br />I haven&#039;t had much luck up and down 37th (yet)

			I have been buying GREAT french bread the past two days at Cannelle -- 31st ave bet. 75/76.&nbsp; They have other kinds, but I haven&#039;t tried them yet.&nbsp; But I can strongly recommend their baguettes.&nbsp; They&#039;re crispy on the outside, with a light and airy inside.&nbsp; Enjoy!

			Hey thanks for the tip.&nbsp; I always view that area as &quot;out of the way and down the hill&quot; although it really isn&#039;t that far, and I could walk off some calories.&nbsp; For those shorter trips, does anyone have other favorite spots for bread closer to 37th?&nbsp; Thanks!

			A while back, Shelby2 recommended the Polish Market on 37th near 80th.
