				Any other recommendations for good accountants for individual tax prep, either in the neighborhood or somewhat nearby (Astoria, Long Island City, etc)? <br /><br />I&#039;d like someone experienced, competent, trustworthy, non-judgmental, efficient, and pleasant to work with. Ideally also someone who responds quickly to questions, and whose office doesn&#039;t feel like the DMV. If this person is a woman, even betterâ€”I&#039;ve found many (not all) male accountants really talk down to female clients.<br /><br />Personal recommendations really seem to be the ticket with things like this rather than online reviews, so many of which seem faked, so would love to hear from anyone on this board who has had a great (or terrible) experience with local accountants. Any details about why you&#039;re recommending would be helpful too. Thanks!
