				Seeing that the Oscars were awarded recently, I should have started this thread sooner.&nbsp; Hey, better late than never...right?&nbsp; Anyway, being the huge movie fan that I am, I&#039;d love to get some recommendations on your favorite movies.&nbsp; I just recently joined Netflix, and am looking to add some movies to my queue.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking forward to renting No Country for Old Men and La Vie en Rose, but since there&#039;s still a long wait for these and other popular movies, I thought I&#039;d enlist your help.&nbsp; So, please post your favorites.&nbsp; All genres are acceptable...remember, I love movies.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />If anyone is interested, I think it would be fun to start something like a Jackson Heights movie club where we can watch a movie (at our leisure of course), and then post comments, etc. <br /><br />Here are some of my recent rental favorites:<br /><br />Pan&#039;s Labyrinth<br />Eastern Promises<br />The Namesake<br />Marie Antoinette<br />Tales from the Crypt<br />Hotel Rwanda<br />Volver<br />The Devil&#039;s Backbone<br /><br />Hubby and I have a nice selection of the old classic Hollywood movies at home, so if anyone wants a recommendation on that front, please say so.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; Horror movie fan here!<br />

				Wow!&nbsp; Eraserhead.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t watched this movie since I was a teen and perhaps much too young to appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing it out Buddy.&nbsp; I&#039;ll definitely add it to my list and even invite a few friends over for movie night.&nbsp; Interesting pick!<br /><br />B movie recommendation:&nbsp; Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, starring John Cusack, Kevin Spacey and Jude Law.<br /><br />If anyone is into odd type movies, I recommend Being John Malkovich.&nbsp; We&#039;re big John Cusack fans, and will watch pretty much any movie he stars in.&nbsp; I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with Room 1408, his most recent horror flick...strange ending.&nbsp; Classic Cusack -- Say Anything and Sixteen Candles.&nbsp; I&#039;m still in love with those!<br /><br />NYCMac -- Last King of Scotland was amazing, and Notes on a Scandal is currently on my queue.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to move it to the top.&nbsp; All the Bourne movies are highly rated here as well.&nbsp; My husband loves the intrigue and the incredible special effects, and how about that Moby song?&nbsp; I recently read that Matt Damon will not be playing the role of Jason Bourne anymore.&nbsp; He&#039;s afraid of being typecast in this type of role.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how successful another Bourne movie would be without Damon though.&nbsp; His involvement is a huge contributing factor to the success these movies have experienced.<br /><br />Buddy, I noticed that you have Shawshank Redemption on your list.&nbsp; Have you see The Green Mile?&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been a Stephen King fan, but these two movies were outstanding in my opinion and rate right up there with The Shining, one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />Silent Movie pick:&nbsp; Speedy -- 1928 Harold LLoyd classic.&nbsp; Babe Ruth has a cameo appearance in this movie as well as a few Civil War vets.&nbsp; TCM just recently played it, so I&#039;m not sure if this is available for rental from a club.&nbsp; I&#039;d say this film can be classified as a silent action film with amazing views of New York City.&nbsp; It was filmed on location throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.&nbsp; A definite must see!<br /><br />Has anyone seen Alfred Hitchcock&#039;s The Wrong Man, starring Henry Fonda and Vera Miles?&nbsp; This is the movie that was partially filmed in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have to check Netflix to see if they have it.&nbsp; There&#039;s a trailer for the movie at Turner Classic Movies:<br /><br />http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=96319

				Do you mean this version of <span class="bbc_u"><strong>The Wrong Man</strong></span> (http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Wrong_Man/70002875?trkid=222336&amp;lnkctr=srchrd-sr&amp;strkid=2018146378_0_0)? (http://cdn-5.nflximg.com/us/boxshots/large/70002875.jpg)<br /><br />Netflix has all the <span class="bbc_u"><strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong></span> (http://www.netflix.com/RoleDisplay/Alfred_Hitchcock/42141?lnkctr=srchrd-sr&amp;strkid=495525257_0_0) movies.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using Netflix for the past 7+ years.

				YEP.&nbsp; That&#039;s the one!&nbsp; Did you watch the trailer?&nbsp; You have to be quick, otherwise you miss the Jackson Heights street scenes.<br /><br />NYCMac, I&#039;ve found many of the more obscure horror flicks at Netflix.&nbsp; I confess, I&#039;ll watch any type of horror, but nothing beats an old fashioned tale of the supernatural for true chills.&nbsp; I&#039;ll also continue going to the movies.&nbsp; Hey, where else can two people catch a movie, eat processed food and pay $40+?&nbsp; I&#039;m being sarcastic of course.&nbsp; I&#039;ve enjoyed the theater scene since the days when the Rocky Horror Picture Show was all the rage.&nbsp; Yes, we dressed in costume and made terrible fools of ourselves!&nbsp; What were we thinking? ::)

				I&#039;ve seen the Wrong Man, and while I enjoyed the JH dimension, it is dated and not among Hitchcock&#039;s best.&nbsp; At the very least, it struck me as naive and quaint, especially with the way the government has rounded up and detained immigrants in recent years, in this very same neighborhood.&nbsp; The movie&#039;s not to blame for this, of course, but it just really seemed to miss the mark because of this.

				Dated?&nbsp; I suppose one can make that claim on many of the older movies.&nbsp; Todd, so you feel your general perception of the movie was affected given the fact that you live in Jackson Heights today?&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp; It hadn&#039;t occurred to me that my actual experience in the neighborhood could somehow affect my judgment of the movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now you&#039;ve made me even more curious!&nbsp; Straight to the top of my queue!&nbsp; Consider this an experiment in sociological filmography, if there is such a thing!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Have you seen The Godfather?&nbsp; This film, widely known as a classic, has been labeled &quot;dated&quot; by few.&nbsp; I happen to disagree.

				In my defense, I am also a tremendous fan of old films.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoy classics like &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; even though it, too, takes place in a very different world from today.<br /><br />In my view, the Wrong Man isn&#039;t as artistic or suspenseful as Hitchcock&#039;s best.&nbsp; Its central story only works from a dramatic point of view if the viewer sees the character&#039;s situation as outrageous or ridiculous.&nbsp; In today&#039;s context, what the lead character experiences is not at all uncommon, so it was hard for me to muster the surprise or outrage necessary to experience the film as Hitchcock intended it. <br /><br />In any case, I&#039;m glad I saw it because of the scenes in the subway station and because the lead character has my exact commute.&nbsp; I just wouldn&#039;t put it high on my recommendation list.<br /><br />I&#039;ll put together a list of the films I have enjoyed recently, and will post it later tonight.

				Since you mention suspense, I recommend The Day of the Jackal, 1973 version.&nbsp; Political thriller centered around the events of a plot to execute Charles De Gaulle.&nbsp; The ingenious plotting by the hired killer and the French Police out to get this guy defines edge of your seat excitement!

				I&#039;ve seen over 300 movies on Netflix over the past 3 years... egads!&nbsp; And it turns out that the majority of these have either been kids&#039; videos or new releases.&nbsp; Before having kids, I would see new releases in the theaters, and mostly rent classics.<br /><br />In any case, looking down my list, here are some recent films I&#039;ve seen on Netflix that were particularly interesting or memorable:<br />Paris, Je T&#039;aime (2007)<br />Paprika (2007)<br />The Lives of Others (2007)<br />Hairspray (2007)<br />The Prestige (2006)<br />The Astronaut Farmer (2006)<br />Volver (2006)<br />Inside Man (2006)<br />Street Fight (2005)<br />The World&#039;s Fastest Indian (2005)<br />Rang de Basanti (2006)<br />Lackawana Blues (2005)<br />Everything is Illuminated (2005)<br />Maria Full of Grace (2004) <br />American Splendor (2003)<br />Talk to Her (2002)<br />Rabbit Proof Fence (2002)<br />Shaolin Soccer (2001)<br /><br />In the comedy/horror genre:<br />The League of Gentlemen (1999) (bizarre BBC miniseries)<br />Shaun of the Dead (2004)

Now, the only sample I could get is a little too yellow, but don&#039;t let whoever does it go to the other extreme and get it too blue. It should just be a sort of grayish-yellow-green. Now, the dining room. I&#039;d like yellow. Not just yellow; a very gay yellow. Something bright and sunshine-y. I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you&#039;ll send one of your men to the grocer for a pound of their best butter, and match that exactly, you can&#039;t go wrong! Now, this is the paper we&#039;re going to use in the hall. It&#039;s flowered, but I don&#039;t want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. There&#039;s some little dots in the background, and it&#039;s these dots I want you to match. Not the little greenish dot near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. Is that clear? Now the kitchen is to be white. Not a cold, antiseptic hospital white. A little warmer, but still, not to suggest any other color but white. Now for the powder room - in here - I want you to match this thread, and don&#039;t lose it. It&#039;s the only spool I have and I had an awful time finding it! As you can see, it&#039;s practically an apple red. Somewhere between a healthy winesap and an unripened Jonathan. Oh, excuse me... <br /><br />Mr. PeDelford: You got that Charlie? <br /><br />Charlie, Painter: Red, green, blue, yellow, white.<br /><br />Mr. PeDelford: Check. &gt;&gt;<br /><br />

				Buddy, what&#039;s hysterical about Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House is that many of the antics that the Myra Loy and Cary Grant characters go through while building their country home are events that plague builders/renovators even today.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cary Grant&#039;s comedic timing is right on as the frustrated husband, and Myrna Loy, elegant as ever, plays the composed and determined wife.&nbsp; A true classic.<br /><br />Todd, I&#039;ve enjoyed about 4 of the of the movies from your list so far.&nbsp; One of them, Volver struck me as a dark comedy.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cemetery scene at the very beginning was the clincher for me...plenty of fear potential here.&nbsp; Penelope Cruz truly demonstrates that she&#039;s more than just a pretty face and she&#039;s very believable in her role.&nbsp; Also, the relationships between sisters, mothers and daughters, as well as the superstitions most believe in, are very true to what you would encounter in many small towns in Latin America and in Spain.&nbsp; I&#039;m partial to Pedro Almodovar, but this happens to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />If you like foreign films, I recommend Live-in Maid, an Argentinean film detailing the relationship between a down on her luck socialite and her humble live-in maid.

				So I finally watched Alfred Hitchcock&#039;s, <strong>The Wrong Man</strong>.&nbsp; While I admit that this is not one of my favorite Hitchcock films, I have to confess that I did find it somewhat of a gripping tale...not edge of your seat gripping, but fascinating nonetheless.&nbsp; The frightening notion that a seemingly innocent person may be arrested simply because he/she may resemble a criminal is something that may be considered unconventional by today&#039;s high-tech standards, but when you think about it, the concept is not so far-fetched at all.&nbsp; This story further pokes into the main characters&#039; psyches and proves how such a crisis can immensely and adversely affect not only the accused, but the immediate family as well.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t aware that this film is based on a true story.&nbsp; Truth be told, my interest was solely rooted on the fact that parts of the movie were filmed in the neighborhood.&nbsp; I appreciated the opportunity of catching quick glimpses of Jackson Heights in the 1950s.&nbsp; Recommended?&nbsp; Yes. :)

				Chuckster I&#039;m a big John Cusack fan myself. SAY ANYTHING, MUST LOVE DOGS, HIGH FIDELITY, RUNAWAY JURY are a few favorites.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve come up with a few more old movies that I really like:<br /><br />MIDNIGHT RUN starring Bob DeNiro and Charles Grodin (love this movie. must have watched it half dozen times.) 1988<br />CATCH 22 (1970) directed by Mike Nichols<br />SOMETHING WILD with Melanie Griffith (b4 she destroyed her face with endless surgeries) and Jeff Daniels<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame I can&#039;t think of anything in the last few years that I really loved except silly comedies:<br />WEDDING CRASHERS<br />SUPERBAD<br /><br />Oh and almost any comedy out of Australia or New Zealand:<br />THE CHANT OF JIMMY BLACKSMITH<br />MAD MAX<br />DEAD CALM<br />LORD OF THE RINGS<br />(Todd I haven&#039;t seen the WORLD&#039;S FASTEST INDIAN yet or it&#039;d probably be here)<br /><br /><br />

				Buddy, if you like Cusack, rent out Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.&nbsp; Cusack plays a magazine writer sent to Savannah, Georgia to cover the holiday parties of the local elite.&nbsp; He ends up covering a murder trial involving an affluent art collector and his dead boyfriend.&nbsp; In the process, he meets some eccentric characters that truly make this movie interesting.&nbsp; Check it out!<br /><br />Wedding Crashers?&nbsp; I like the Wedding Singer!&nbsp; I can truly relate to the awesome soundtrack.

				Anyone watch the Japanese film <strong>The Woman in the Dunes</strong>?&nbsp; Amazing film about an entomology teacher that gets trapped by locals into living and working in a sand dune in some far off desert.&nbsp; He&#039;s forced to share a living space with a woman who has been working for monthly rations by shoveling sand into buckets that are collected nightly.&nbsp; Without giving too much of the film away, it&#039;s interesting to see how the teacher develops an attraction to this unknown woman and how he manages to adjust to an extremely difficult lifestyle, and even goes so far as to develop a personal bond with the sand that now dominates his life.&nbsp; There are phenomenal visual affects in this film involving sand storms and attempts at escape.&nbsp; Huge thumb&#039;s up!

				So I watched an independent film last night called <strong>Open Water</strong>, loosely based on the true story of a young couple that gets inadvertently left behind in the ocean by a tour boat while on a scuba diving trip.&nbsp; At first I thought this movie would be a cheesy attempt at replicating the drama of Jaws or similar box office hits, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised that the movie focused more on the plight of two people trying to maintain their calm while at the same time managing to avoid shark attacks.&nbsp; The film is not a blood gore fest....nonetheless, I wouldn&#039;t recommend it for the squeamish type.&nbsp; It runs approximately 1 1/2 hours and does manage to keep you on the edge of your seat wondering whatâ€™s going to happen next.<br /><br />Another film from our horror movie night was <strong>El Orfanato</strong> (The Orphanage), produced by Guillermo del Toro, the director of Panâ€™s Labyrinth.&nbsp; I would classify this as more of a psychological thriller rather than horror with a few â€œghostsâ€ thrown in here and there for fear effect.&nbsp; Geraldine Chaplin, the daughter of silent film star Charlie Chaplin plays a minor role as a medium in a sÃ©ance scene.&nbsp; The film, although not overly frightening, is effective in its use of creepy music, sound and visual effects and, of course, its haunted mansion (orphanage).&nbsp; The story is centered on a young family that decides to operate a home for special needs childrenâ€¦the home originally being an orphanage where one of the main characters was raised.&nbsp; Overall a well done movie, and I&#039;d go so far as to say that it&#039;s even thought provoking.&nbsp; At least for our small, horror movie loving group it was.&nbsp; &nbsp;:coolsmiley:<br />

				After having it sit next to my TV for almost two weeks, I finally sat down to watch The Third Man.&nbsp; In my opinion, this movie is a classic example of film noir at its best.&nbsp; It has all the timeless elements of the genre including a story full of mystery and intrigue, shady characters, dark alleys and creepy shadows, in addition to outstanding performances by lead actors Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli and of course, Orson Welles.&nbsp; The camera work and lighting effects are exceptional, as is the catchy Zither tune that is played throughout.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you like Citizen Kane, this movie is a must see.<br /><br />Set in postwar Vienna, the story focuses on the character, Holly Martins, a down-on-his-luck American that decides to take his friend up on an offer to work with him in Vienna.&nbsp; Upon his arrival in Vienna, Martins discovers that his friend has died a mysterious death.&nbsp; This is where all the sleauthing and mystery begin, as Martins sets out to find out what really happened to his friend Harry Lime.&nbsp; I loved this movie!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />

				Other than his performance in the movie Tombstone, I can&#039;t seem to recall if I&#039;ve seen Val Kilmer in any role that I&#039;ve said to myself, &quot;wow&quot;.&nbsp; He just hasn&#039;t had that break-out role as an actor, in my opinion.

Even now, some four decades on, when the optimistic buzz of the space race has drifted away and we&#039;re awash in films whose special effects dwarf the imaginations of an earlier Hollywood, and our media-saturated selves have been assaulted by more homages and parodies than one can even begin to count, there is still nothing quite like the film&#039;s opening, with the sun and crescent moon perfectly aligned and the soundtrack blasting Wagner&#039;s &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra.&quot; <br /></em><br /><br />I loved it.&nbsp; Classic Kubrick.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Lately Iâ€™ve been discovering â€œnewâ€ movies that make me wonder why theyâ€™ve been hiding from me for so long.&nbsp; Or at least thatâ€™s the justification Iâ€™ve been using to explain why I havenâ€™t seen some venerable classics yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;My latest discovery is a Billy Wilder movie called <strong>Witness for the Prosecution</strong>, starring Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power (I think this may have been his last movie performance), Marlene Dietrich, Elsa Lanchester and a few easily recognizable character actors such as Una Oâ€™Connor, the maid from the horror classic The Bride of Frankenstein.&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on an Agatha Christie story, the movie is a courtroom drama that also offers a few laughs via the relationship of a cranky English barrister and his obsessive live-in nurse.<br /><br />Charles Laughton is convincing as the curmudgeon Sir Wilfred, whom against doctorâ€™s orders, has decided to take on one last criminal case.&nbsp; Heâ€™s supposed to be convalescing from a recent hospital stay due to a heart attack.&nbsp; Lanchester plays his nurse that is just as stubborn in her overbearing and comical treatment of his medical condition.&nbsp; Tyrone Power is the defendant accused of murdering an older woman whom heâ€™s been frequenting unbeknownst to his wife, played by Marlene Dietrich, the prosecutionâ€™s main witness.<br /><br />This is a whodunit, comedy and suspense filled drama all rolled into one great movie.&nbsp; The plot has twists and turns and the ending even has a surprise built in.&nbsp; Needless to say, the acting is as noteworthy as the movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;Suspenseful and fun to watch! <br />

				The Dark Knight is bar none the best comic book movie ever.&nbsp; I saw it a couple of days ago and it exceeds all the hype.&nbsp; The Joker is as dark as Hannibal Lecter, Heath Ledger was superb.&nbsp; There is a lot of talk about Ledger deserving and Oscar nomination.&nbsp; I actually predict an Oscar nomination for this masterpiece.<br /><br />BTW I strongly suggest that kids under 13 do not go to see this movie.&nbsp; It should have been rated R&nbsp;

				<strong>The Dark Knight</strong> was really good.&nbsp; Heath Ledger&#039;s performance was phenomenal.&nbsp; It&#039;s totally his film.<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend <strong>The Wackness</strong>.&nbsp; It&#039;s a nice little coming-of-age story set in the 90s, in NYC.&nbsp; Ben Kingsley gives an excellent performance as a wacky, weed-smoking, therapist for the protagonist teenager.&nbsp; Cool soundtrack.&nbsp; :rockon:

				Buddy..I agree with you when it comes to violent movies.&nbsp; Some are so real that it&#039;s disturbing to watch.&nbsp; &nbsp; Two movies which are extremely good movies and I found that once is enough ( even though I have both of them on DVD ) because of the disturbing nature are The Passion of The Christ and United 93.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though I enjoy watching good movies more than once because I see things I didn&#039;t notice the first time, I can&#039;t find myself to see these again.

				I just saw Moonstruck (1987) with Cher, Nicholas Cage and Olympic Dukakis. It was utterly charming! Romantic comedies these days barely compare. I love how all the important scenes took place around the dining table, the focus on family, and all those long, tracking shots of New York. And almost every line is a quotable classic!

The satanic like Insomnia moves along with destruction in its shadow. The only clan able to stand up to Insomnia is Omei. These are Zu&#039;s warriors risking it all to secure peace at Zu. The story, sort of weak specially with the immortals bickering about what seems irrelevant at the beginning but the special effects were so amazing most of you will agree with me.&nbsp; It had it all, warriors walking the mountains, saints looking from the havens, evil spirits. Heck there were people standing on meteorites of some sort looking down and metal-winged warriors battling &#039;till the end.<br /><br /><div align="center">(http://picasion.com/pic3/fac9579355052a7ce85fa6139112dd64.gif)&nbsp; (http://picasion.com/pic3/ee8ce962dd9c9de79bcbbac4ad1c4628.gif)</div><br />The fight with the super fast and disappearing demon warriors and the one on one with the metal winged warriors scenes (This will freak you out).&nbsp; I am a big fan of FX&#039;s but the Chinese have made me a real fan of their work.&nbsp; For those that don&#039;t care much for action / fantasy flicks give this one a chance.&nbsp; The customs, the hair, the music and while I don&#039;t speak Mandarin I truly found this movie beautiful.&nbsp; After seen it a few times you can immerse yourself in the movies story which was basically the same as the 1983 original version (I never saw the original one but read about it) but with 100 X&#039;s the FX.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x3_drAAfbY&amp;feature=related (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x3_drAAfbY&amp;feature=related)<br />

				<strong>The Washington Post&#039;s</strong> DVD &amp; Home Video section recently had a write-up on the release of Universal&#039;s box set of the 80&#039;s Brat Pack movies.&nbsp; The newly released set, the <em>High School Flashback Collection</em>, contains some of my all time favorite blasts from the past, including <em>The Breakfast Club</em>!&nbsp; According to the writer, the set also boasts an improved, albeit still not great, section on special features.&nbsp; <br /><br />(http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d107/Raespix/breakfastclub.jpg)<br /><br /><strong>washingtonpost.com</strong><br />Don&#039;t You Forget This DVD Collection (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/movies/features/bonus-points/091608.html)<br />By JEN CHANEY<br />washingtonpost.com Staff Writer<br />Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2008<br /><br />John Hughes saved my generation. Maybe that sounds like hyperbole, but to the kids who struggled with their own particular brand of adolescent angst in the 1980s, Hughes&#039;s coming-of-age films served as the best kind of cinematic comfort food. Collectively, they reminded teens that it&#039;s okay to be confused, jaded, occasionally depressed and completely comfortable with eating Cap&#039;n Crunch and Pixy Stix sandwiches for lunch.<br /><br />Unlike many pop culture phenomena from the &#039;80s (see parachute pants or virtually any episode of &quot;Solid Gold&quot;), the Hughes canon still resonates with young people who weren&#039;t even born when the movies first projected onto theater screens. And that&#039;s why it always seemed shameful that the DVDs for flicks like &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; came with barely any bonus features.<br /><br />This week, Universal attempts to rectify that error with the &quot;High School Flashback Collection&quot; ($39.98), a box set that includes brand new releases of three quintessential Hughes pictures: the aforementioned &quot;Breakfast Club,&quot; &quot;Sixteen Candles,&quot; and &quot;Weird Science.&quot; While the special features on each still aren&#039;t as robust as one might hope, they definitely note a marked improvement over the multiple lackluster versions that preceded them.<br /><br />Packaged together in a tin box designed to look like a high school locker, the collection not only dredges up some fun trivia about each film, it attempts to put the impact of the Hughes films into a larger cultural context. Everyone from teen-movie experts Amy Heckerling (director of &quot;Clueless&quot;) and Diablo Cody (writer of &quot;Juno&quot;) to journalists like Entertainment Weekly&#039;s Owen Gleiberman and the Post&#039;s own Hank Stuever appear in the documentaries to discuss the deeper meanings of the Brat Pack genre. Numerous cast members, including Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy, also participate.<br /><br />Since all of these discs are available for individual sale ($19.98), you may be tempted to just buy one and skip the collection. If you do, go with &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; ($19.98). In addition to being the most influential of the Hughes films, it also boasts the most solid DVD extras, including a 51-minute documentary, a featurette about the Brat Pack and an engaging commentary track with Hall and Nelson.<br /><br />The extras on &quot;Weird Science&quot; -- which comes with a brief documentary and the pilot for the TV series based on the comedy, about two geeks who create their own dream woman -- are the most limited. But it&#039;s the ones for &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; that may be the most disappointing. Yes, the DVD does deliver a 38-minute look at the movie&#039;s legacy, with contributions from cast members like Hall, Justin Henry, Gedde Watanabe and Paul Dooley. But that&#039;s the only bonus material we get. And what&#039;s worse, there is no sign of Michael Schoeffling -- the since-retired actor who played the iconic dreamboat Jake Ryan -- or John Hughes muse Molly Ringwald. &quot;The core of &#039;Sixteen Candles&#039; is Molly,&quot; says John Kapelos, who played &quot;oily bohunk&quot; Rudy. He&#039;s right, and that makes her absence all the more glaring.<br /><br />Speaking of absent, the now reclusive Hughes, not surprisingly, doesn&#039;t make a single appearance on the collection. In recent years, he has turned into an almost J.D. Salinger-like figure: rarely seen or heard from but still admired by filmmaker and film lovers who were influenced by his work. We can only hope that someday he&#039;ll emerge to talk about these movies, for a DVD documentary or a commentary. And when he does, yet another box set -- perhaps an even more comprehensive version than this one -- will celebrate the return of the Teen Movie King.<br /><br />Best Brat Pack Bonus Point: &quot;The Most Convenient Definitions,&quot; a featurette on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; DVD, allows journalist David Blum to explain how he first coined the term Brat Pack in a New York magazine article. And Nelson, it seems, is still a little miffed about the way he and his actor friends were depicted in that story. &quot;He portrayed us as bad people and we weren&#039;t,&quot; he says. &quot;We had fun. That, I guess, is not allowed.&quot;<br /><br />Best Trivia in a Bonus Point: This one&#039;s a tie. I appreciated learning that Sheedy is responsible for suggesting the quote from David Bowie&#039;s &quot;Changes&quot; that marks the beginning of &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; But it was even more delicious to discover that -- in the uproarious wedding scene from &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; -- the woman who scoots over in the pew so that drugged-up bride Ginny (Blanche Baker) can sit down is none other than John Belushi&#039;s mother.

				I remember watching Bette Davis for the first time in <em>Of Human Bondage</em> alongside Leslie Howard.&nbsp; I also remember how much I disliked her character in that movie.&nbsp; &nbsp;She was very convincing in that role, and as a result I became a fan.&nbsp; Needless to say, I never get tired of watching her movies.<br /><br />Anyone remember Davis in <em>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</em>&nbsp; Buddy, maybe that&#039;s the movie you have in mind?&nbsp; Joan Crawford was in Mildred Pierce and she also co-starred with Bette Davis in Baby Jane.&nbsp; Eve Arden was also in Mildred Pierce.<br /><br />Edited: Buddy, just realized you were listing your favs!<br /><br />

				Among the movies now playing, I have seen three recently.<br /><br />If you believe the words of Dr. Martin Luther King that &quot;an injustice done to one, is an injustice done to all&quot;, then whether you&#039;re gay or not, MILK is an important film as it chronicles a chapter in the history of civil rights.&nbsp; Sean Penn, as Harvey Milk, portrays not only Milk&#039;s efforts to obtain equal rights, but also his journey from narcissism to activism.<br /><br />The violence depicted in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE made it a difficult film to watch.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t the gratuitous violence of a Matrix or Bond flick.&nbsp; It is a type of real violence too often experienced by the poor.&nbsp; There were scenes where I wanted to close my eyes, but closed eyes allow this type of evil to exist.&nbsp; This is an important film to see.<br /><br />For a well earned &quot;feel good&quot; moment this holiday season Will Smith&#039;s SEVEN POUNDS is one to see.&nbsp; It has been criticized for being &quot;schmaltzy&quot; but this is a &quot;schmaltzy&quot; time of year.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t take a genius to see where this film is going but the seven people provide an excuse to sit back and enjoy an old fashioned &quot;good guy&#039; wins story.&nbsp; I have to confess I am a big fan of Will&#039;s and would probably applaud if he simply came center stage and recited the alphabet, but his performance here is better than the critics assessment.<br /><br />Bring on the popcorn.....<br />

				Caught a showing of &quot;Gran Torino&quot; in Sunnyside tonight.&nbsp; I am not a big Clint Eastwood fan so there was little motivation to see this.&nbsp; Enter my brothers who prodded me into going and am really glad they did and that I went.&nbsp; Archie Bunker lives again!&nbsp; Eastwood explodes every politically incorrect landmine as he steps into the lives of the people around him.&nbsp; Most curse him and walk away but the three who don&#039;t--a young priest who epitomizes &quot;the deer caught in the headlights&quot; and two young Asian neighbors who are brother and sister--challenge him and cause him to rethink the stereotypes that have molded his worldview and are sapping the life force out of him.&nbsp; What follows is the classic frog to prince next act.&nbsp; The acting is uneven, some of script is a little to corny but it&nbsp; achieves the effect and takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride not unlike Magic Mountain.&nbsp; Well worth a view.<br />Two-Thumbs up.

				<strong>I had a couple of Hrs to burn yesterday during the day...I went to College Point and saw &quot;The Soloist&quot;<br /><br />I liked it, I wish there would have been more music.&nbsp; I&#039;m a fan Jamie Foxx and he didn&#039;t disappoint as Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man with remarkable musical talent and he is also remarkably schizophrenic.&nbsp; At first i wanted to laugh at Foxx&#039;s rendition of the crazy guy but then i realize it wasn&#039;t very funny at all, it was actually very sad.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ayers grasp of reality may be tenuous, but his sense of self is incredibly vivid. Sometimes it may get melodramatic but the film was different, less Hollywood-ish and better than I expected. Ayers and Lopez are intense and very complicated...it worked.&nbsp; I guess the drugs did Downey a whole lot of good after all...LOL</strong><br /><br /><div align="center">(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/story.jpg?t=1240966413)</div>

				I just saw &quot;Frozen River.&quot;&nbsp; I really liked it, although it is a bit depressing.&nbsp; Melissa Leo received a best actress nomination and I believe the writer/director received a screen writing nomination.&nbsp; Both were well deserved.&nbsp; What I like best about it is that, although it seems like it takes place in North Dakota, it actually takes place in upstate New York, near the town of Massena.&nbsp; I&#039;ve visited that area and it does seem as far removed from JH as the Dakotas.&nbsp; Give the movie a shot.

It&#039;s a Southern story about a friendless shy boy who grows up with his puppy Skip.&nbsp; The puppy becomes a well known character in the small town and it is through the puppy that the boy transcends his shyness and grows up.&nbsp; Kevin Bacon&#039;s performance as a bitter WWI Medal of Honor winner crippled from his act of heroism on the battlefield who cannot adequately express his love for his son is very moving.&nbsp; This is a tremendous and restrained performance.<br /><br /><br /><strong>&quot;Marley and Me&quot; </strong>was surprisingly good.&nbsp; Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston from whom I didn&#039;t expect too much&nbsp; were good ... really good ... as a couple from falling in love to marriage to competing careers&nbsp; and raising their children&nbsp; along with their&nbsp; Cesar Milan failure of a puppy who grows up to be very naughty (discipline challenged) and very wonderful family pet.&nbsp; Marley (named after Bob Marley) becomes the subject of Wilson&#039;s, a reporter, newspaper column.&nbsp; <br /><br />A young and loving family ... smart, educated, attractive, responsible grappling with what we all suffer through sans drugs, booze, beatings, car chases, swearing, terminal illness, adultery, teen pregnancy, criminal acts, shootings, racism, self hatred&nbsp; and children who hate their parents and beat up their teachers.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Grey Gardens</strong> <br />Starring Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange<br /><br />The Bouvier relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy who, because of hardtimes, inability to cope with their precariously dwindling finances and just plain loopiness make headlines in the sixties because of their bizarre&nbsp; living conditions, in a once beautiful but now crumbling decaying mansion, Grey Gardens, in Southampton.&nbsp; The mansion that falls on hard times where raccoons, hundreds of feral cats&nbsp; along with its human residents&nbsp; Edie and Edie Biele, mother and daughter live with tons of garbage, no hot water, no electricity, no heat, leaking ceilings and walls falling down, no friends and, of course, no money.&nbsp; They have only themselves and their house and their memories of a time long gone.&nbsp; Grey Gardens is one of the stars of films.&nbsp; It is a metaphor for the lives of its human residents.&nbsp; Once rich and beautiful filled with servants and music and parties&nbsp; and children and a not so happy couple it gets old and decrepit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The parents divorce, the house falls into disrepair because there is no money for upkeep.&nbsp; Slowly their friends disappear, hopes for a career on stage or movies becomes impossible, a transient love affair does not survive.&nbsp; Only the love of the mother and daughter survives all.&nbsp; A couple of brave documentarians, the Maysles, willing to film their wretched lives as is recreates the dreams and hopes for both mother and daughter.&nbsp; No rewrites, no makeovers, no scripts, no second takes ... just a hand held camera and the Bieles as they are.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barrymore is an American treasure.&nbsp; It is one of the finest performances ever ... on a par with the best of Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn and Patricia Neal.&nbsp; Barrymore is Barrymore&nbsp; ... brilliant, moving, funny, sad and triumphant!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; She was always a good actress but this role puts her in another pantheon.&nbsp; She is a pure joy to watch.

				TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has a blog called MovieMorlocks.com.&nbsp; There&#039;s a blog entry today where the writer compiles a list of the top 10 movie quotes he thinks should just go away.<br /><br /><strong>â€œGo aheadâ€¦ make my day.â€</strong>&nbsp; Check out the list of 10 classic movie quotes I want to go away (http://moviemorlocks.com/2009/06/19/10-classic-movie-quotes-i-wish-would-go-away/)<br /><br />It&#039;s a good thing that none of The Godfather quotes are included on the list. ::)

				Turner Classic Movies is showing Rear Window right now.&nbsp; This is the Alfred Hitchcock film that&#039;s rumored to have been filmed at the Belvedere Co-op in Jackson Heights.&nbsp; Rumor?&nbsp; Anyone have any new information to report on this?<br /><br />I did catch some of the window scenes, and the garden area does look vaguely familiar.&nbsp; Keyword = vaguely.&nbsp; I think the movie started at 10:00 pm in case anyone is interested in tuning in.

				I was told my friend to watch a film, but it was (a) a documentary, and (b) about video game battles, so I was skeptical.&nbsp; But since it was on instant Netflix, I watched <strong>The King of Kong:&nbsp; A Fistful of Quarters</strong>.&nbsp; (www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/)<br /><br />It was actually very compelling, and I recommend it.&nbsp; Especially for those in my generation (child of the 80s) ...

				And, semi related (since I can&#039;t find the iPhone thread right now) ... iPhone users can download the freeload Netflix app and watch movies on their phones.&nbsp; For those of us with a 30 minutes bus ride commute, that&#039;s quite handy!

				Horror movie fans... Guillermo del Toro&#039;s remake of the 1973 (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069992/) creepy horror flick, &quot;Don&#039;t Be Afraid of the Dark,&quot; opens Friday, August 26th. &nbsp;The original made for TV movie was quite effective in scaring the heck out of me as a kid. &nbsp;I&#039;m due for another good scare. &nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Movie Trailer: &nbsp;Don&#039;t Be Afraid of the Dark 2010 (http://www.dontbeafraidofthedark.com/mobile/)
