				I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on with Fruita Dona, the produce/natural store on 37th and 83rd on the south side of the street. This is not the Downtown Natural Market, but a different store that started off as a produce market and then expanded into some natural items. It&#039;s possible they might be closing.<br /><br />In any case, if you&#039;re looking for some packaged products, they have some really good prices right now due to a 30% off clearance sale. I didn&#039;t really look at many specific items, but I did buy a Hu chocolate bar for $3.15, and those bars are $5.99 at another nearby place.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/Plm7p0E.jpg)<br />(https://i.imgur.com/4asrwIr.jpg)<br />(https://i.imgur.com/PzyerAx.jpg)<br /><br />

				The current name of this place is Natural Farm Fresh, but it was Fruita Dona for a long time.

				They&#039;re definitely closing. It&#039;s a shame--people who work there are lovely.

				I spoke to one of the managers and he said they are not closing.&nbsp; They are just not going to be a &quot;health&quot; food store as there is too much competition with Downtown Market. If the store was in the 70&#039;s or on Northern it probably would have done well. Most probably it will be another vegetable market.&nbsp; Too bad because I really like that store.&nbsp; At least it is still in business.
