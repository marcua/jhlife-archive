				Hello folks,<br />&nbsp;<br />Good news! The very much awaited art classes are here! <br />I would love to hear from you if you are interested in in enrolling your child, if the hours work for you etc...I will follow shortly with additional information, web site and precise starting date. <br />&nbsp;<br />Background:<br />&nbsp;<br />With school budgets being drastically cut, one of the first subjects to be eliminated is the art class. Children are magnificently creative.&nbsp; They want to make art, explore, touch and experiment with materials. They need to make art as much as they need to learn how to read, write, do math exercises etc... To fill this critical void, we will be conducting art classes for children to explore the exciting and enjoyable process of art making.&nbsp; Working out of a centrally located space (The Jewish Center) in Jackson Heights, this convenient location allows parents to catch up with some local errands or shopping while your child is in class. <br />&nbsp; <br />Philosophy and curriculum:<br />&nbsp; <br />All classes will be conducted under the supervision of Deborah Wasserman.&nbsp; Deborah has been teaching art to children for over 15 years.&nbsp; She has worked in the Art Education Departments of many major museums in NYC (the Guggenheim Museum, The New Museum of contemporary Art, The Bronx Museum, the Jewish Museum) and has developed an â€˜inquiry basedâ€™ approach to teaching art. An open-ended dialogue replaces â€˜Lecturingâ€™ and the students will be encouraged to create their own vocabulary and set of tools to perceive, understand and make art. The main emphasis of these classes is on the process of art making and the wondrous exploration of the studentâ€™s unique vision. None of the projects assigned to the students is a â€˜Cookie cutterâ€™.&nbsp; The projects are designed in such a way that students will employ their imagination, make choices, learn techniques, discover new materials and get creative! If time permits,&nbsp; Deborah will lead monthly museum tours for families and children as an extension of these classes.<br />&nbsp; <br />Schedule:<br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will start in October.&nbsp; They will run parallel to the public school schedule. Additional classes may be offered during the holidays while the kidâ€™s ore out of school.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Classes will run Mon-Thursday. Length of classes: 1 hour&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. After School: 2 classes each afternoon: 3:15-4:15, or 4:30-5:30. Classes are divided into ages:&nbsp; 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 <br />&nbsp;2. Morning Toddlers (with parents or nannies), ages 3-4: 10:00AM-11:00AM, 11:15AM to 12:15AM. <br />&nbsp; <br />Subjects to explore throughout the year: <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. Techniques in drawings <br />&nbsp;2. Painting techniques <br />&nbsp;3. Sumi drawing <br />&nbsp;4. Collage techniques <br />&nbsp;5. Sculpture and 3-d <br />&nbsp;6. Puppet making. <br />&nbsp;7. Bookmaking classes (with parents) <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Charge: The charge is $15 for a one-hour class. The monthly fee is $60.<br />Materials included.<br />&nbsp; <br />Deborah Wasserman&#039;s biography:<br />&nbsp;<br />Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and raised in Israel, Deborah Wasserman is currently living and working in Queens, NY.&nbsp; She is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program.&nbsp; Deborah Wasserman has received grants from the Experimental Television Center, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Aljira Center for the Arts and the America-Israel cultural foundation. Her work has been exhibited in the USA, Brazil, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel, in such venues as The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Tel Aviv Museum of the Arts, The World Wide Video Festival, White Columns, Gale Gates Gallery, GenArt and A.I.R gallery.<br />&nbsp;<br />To see my teaching resume, please go to my we site at:<br />&nbsp;<br />http://www.deborahwasserman.com/teaching_art.html<br /><br />Looking forward to working together,<br />&nbsp;<br />Deborah<br />www.deborahwasserman.com &lt;http://www.deborahwasserman.com&gt; <br /><br />If you would like to enroll your child, please contact me at: debwass@earthlink.net<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />

				Hi Deb,<br />I emailed you through the site a few days ago like you suggested and I still have not received a response.&nbsp; But what I really would like to know (and perhaps did not properly phrase in my earlier post) is will you have a class for older kids on the weekends which will be easier for working mommies to bring their children to.&nbsp; My daughter is 11 years old and loves to draw.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a shred of artistic skill.&nbsp; But I do have a a 9-5 job. So, anything on the weekends maybe coming up?
