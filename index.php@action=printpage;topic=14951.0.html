				Recently moved to JH, and find the commute to be much longer than anticipated.&nbsp; Residents, realtors and even the MTA suggest travel to midtown is 30-40 min but the shortest time has been 45 min.&nbsp; Wondering what others are experiencing.&nbsp; Thanks

				It does not take 45 minutes to get to midtown. I commute from JH way down to the financial district every day and it takes between 45 minutes to an hour door to door.&nbsp; When agents say it takes X minutes to get to midtown, they are referring to the first stop in Manhattan, not Penn Station.&nbsp; So yes, sometimes it takes more than a half hour to get to lower midtown. <br /><br />But it does not take 45 minutes to get to midtown unless there&#039;s a delay. Even when I take the slow boats (R or M). I never take the 7 so I have no idea if it takes longer on that line.<br /><br />Edited to say Welcome to the neighborhood!

				I make it door to door in about 30 minutes to Hells Kitchen. <br /><br /><br />You have 3 elements -<br /><br /><br />Walk to the subway<br />Train ride<br />Walk to work<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m lucky though. I live a block and a half away from the station, I can take either the E or F (saves a minute or two), and I citibike it to work from there (saves 10 minutes). <span style="font-family: Verdana;" class="bbc_font"><span style="font-size: 2px;" class="bbc_size">I love shaving time off my commute. </span></span><br /><br /><br />I just plotted on google maps going to &quot;midtown&quot; and it says 22 minutes. I believe this to be true. Google isn&#039;t working for the realtor. <br /><br /><br />Where are your bottlenecks? Is the subway stopping too frequently? Is your walk too far at either end? <br /><br />

				What an absurd statement by a realtor. door-to-door. Where in JH do you live? By the 7? Not included. In the mid 80s? Allow 15 minutes walk to the subway. 10 minute walk at the end?

Like a goddamn teleporter?<br /><br />If you take the E or F train (not the locals)&nbsp; -AND- they are running OK without delays.<br />Roosevelt Avenue to 5-53 or 47-50 St at rush hour takes ~15 minutes on the train*<br /><br />In reality this means that with delays and stoppages you should allow for 25 minutes riding time.&nbsp; Add your walk time!<br /><br />YMMV!<br /><br />* which is an INCREDIBLY short journey time to midtown for an area this affordable.

				The subway ride on the express F train from Roosevelt Ave to 42nd Street is about 16 minutes if there are no delays.&nbsp; Add a 10 minute walk to the subway........5 minute wait time.......and another 5 minutes to walk to where you are going and you&#039;ve got a 36 minute commute.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy for that to extend to 40 or 45 minutes if there is just a little bit of train traffic.&nbsp; The E train commute is a wee bit longer since it runs down 8th Avenue.&nbsp; The local M or R train....add 5 to 10 minutes.&nbsp; The 7 has a zillion stops so I avoid that for the most part.&nbsp; I would agree that a 30-40 commute is accurate (door to door) if there are no delays.

				I&#039;m a 5 minute walk to the Roosevelt Ave station and I take the F train to 42nd St for work every morning. With no delays the ride is 20 min, then another quick 5 min walk to work. So total commute time is 30 min without delays, but I do account for train traffic/sick passenger, etc and give myself 45 min.

				simone, I think you misread lalochezia&#039;s response.&nbsp; She was agreeing with you and making fun of the way realtors magically find ways to shorten the commute.&nbsp; She is a regular commenter here and you are brand new&nbsp; - please note that we aim for civility on this board.

				To me, 30 min door to desk on a good day to Times Sq, including 5 min bus to the express stop. Or 35 to 40 min if I walk to express. Or 1 hour riding the bicycle (respecting all traffic laws). <br />

It&#039;s not even an agent thing; it&#039;s a New Yorker thing. When people say &quot;x minutes to Midtown,&quot; they&#039;re referring to the 1st stop in Manhattan, whether that be 59th/Lex or 53rd/Lex. If you&#039;re talking about the commute to Times Square or 34th Street, then you mention that specific location.

				I live 10min walk to the train, my best option is F as I work near Bryant Park, on good days, I am 30/35 min door to door. Generally speaking, my commute has gotten better, experiencing less train delays. <br />This week is an exeption though, trains delays :(

				I live a block from the 82nd Street stop and work across from Grand Central.&nbsp; Less than 30 minutes is about right, door to door, but that&#039;s also because there&#039;s an underground passage that takes me right to the entrance of my office building, with little to no walking.&nbsp; I am probably the exception, but as a rough estimate, it&#039;s accurate.<br /><br />I also like my stop.&nbsp; Train usually empties at 74th, and I almost always thereafter get a seat.&nbsp; Almost always means that, over the past decade, I haven&#039;t gotten a seat about 10 times.&nbsp; Pretty good odds.

				Door to desk (mid 80s and 34th) to Flatiron district: 35 minutes with good connections - taking 7 and 6 locals.<br /><br />Midtown can mean many locations - five minutes longer than what the realtors told you is fair, no?

				I said that it seemed fair/reasonable because you said your commute was <strong>much</strong> longer. In my mind, five minutes didn&#039;t seem out of line with what you were told.&nbsp; <br /><br />EDITED: I just re-read your original post.&nbsp; Seems that :45 was your shortest...hopefully there are more of those than not.
