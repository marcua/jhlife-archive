				&nbsp;There is an obscene amount of money being spent on 34th Avenue, not in the median, or to fix the many issues but to replant those hulking planters that were just installed. It&#039;s a waste of resources when so many other areas in the neighborhood are looking very shabby right now. The HORT is the same group that I believe does those overly fancy displays at Diversity Plaza, am I right? They are beautiful arrangements, kind of like hotel landscaping, and it looks odd juxtaposed with the rest of the scene there. Anyone know who is working with this well financed group and how they could interact more with the local gardening community to conserve and spread around resources??

				Why should only Manhattan get beautiful plantings?&nbsp; <br /><br />We deserve them equally. <br /><br />Complaining about something beautiful is weird. <br /><br />What? We only deserve straggly weeds and half dead plants?<br /><br />I am appreciative of the beauty. Thank you HORT.<br /><br />

				&nbsp;to ABC...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Point of clarification here, do you actually walk on 34th Ave because my point is that the plants in the large planters were far from dead as they were only recently installed. They were oddly replaced with even newer plants all the while, the median plants are scraggly and half dead as you say. Very odd use of resources for planting to replace the newish ones and ignore the areas of high need, don&#039;t you think?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do disagree with this use of seasonal plantings a la Rockefeller Center or similar public space as we are a residential neighborhood and a more green, sustainable approach would seem more in line with the area. Look at the various permaculture gardens in the neighborhood for more info.

And yes, that amount of money - not the flowers!- is obscene by comparison to what is spent by our local gardeners for a much more sustainable and green approach. The plantings at Diversity Plaza last a matter of days and are expensive installations in an area that has high social needs along with physical plant issues that could benefit from that spending. The median is so filled with dog urine and waste and residual Roundup that was used by NYC Parks on most blocks that we probably should not have anyone gardening in those spaces at this time.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

And how much is being spent monthly since HORT began working on 34 OS?<br /><br />BTW, HORT is under a contract with the DoT, so if you don&#039;t like how money is being spent contact DoT.

				I was wondering about the planters on 34th Avenue.&nbsp; They seem oddly placed near fire hydrants.&nbsp; Will these eventually become trash receptacles like at Diversity Plaza?

				^the planters replace the extra barricades DoT had set out on the corners with fire hydrants. Because of where the hydrants are on those blocks there isn&#039;t a legal parking space between the hydrant and the crosswalk (though people park there), so the planters serve to beautify and deter cars from entering the block.<br /><br />I think the HORT funding runs through December for now, so HORT employees can clean on out planters. We&#039;ll have to see what happens after that - with both the DoT proposal for 34 OS and funding for employees. I haven&#039;t seen any collecting trash, and I think they&#039;ve been out for about six weeks now.
