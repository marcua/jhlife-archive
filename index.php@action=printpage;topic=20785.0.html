				&nbsp;I do think the numbers and the level of sickness don&#039;t warrant the restrictions with the current level of information available. But if this falls into the category of &quot;with an abundance of caution&quot; and certain decisions are made at this time that confuse us all, I&#039;ll go along. Everyone in my immediate and extended circle who has passed from Covid, or gotten really ill, has seen it progress very, very quickly so if this is the early response and it&#039;s tempered later, I&#039;m ok with that. But your point is taken here.

				It appears that current vaccines are less resistant to to Omicron variant. Today&#039;s report from South Africa says that the Omicron may be 3 times more likely to create breakthrough infections&nbsp; That is a cause for concern for public health officials and pharmaceutical companies that have been advocating the vaccines as the best solution for the pandemic. Investors who speculate on the market have to react on early news and public health officials may have to prepare alternative measures. It remains to be seen if this variant is more dangerous than others. So far it seems mild, but we&#039;ll need a few weeks to really judge its impact.

				Sorry, it seems I misunderstood the report from South Africa.&nbsp; It was referring to re-infections in particular, or people who had previously been infected, not vaccinated people.&nbsp; The study was not peer reviewed.&nbsp; <br /><br />CBS News has the story here: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/omicron-variant-covid-cases-reinfection-boosters-africa-vaccine-equity/ (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/omicron-variant-covid-cases-reinfection-boosters-africa-vaccine-equity/)

				The spread of the Omicron variant only underscores the failure of the major Western countries, the US above all, to develop a strategy for eliminating this deadly virus worldwide. Instead, we are told we must learn to &quot;live with COVID&quot;, i.e., to accept more than 1,000 people, 400,000 a year, dying from it, and no one knows how many contracting long Covid that will potentially affect them for the rest of their lives. If people in our neighborhood are still wearing masks outside, it is because they know so many people who died or were sickened by the virus.

				Thank you for having the patience to argue with &quot;common sense&quot;. China, with more than three times the US population has less than 5,000 recorded deaths, compared to more than 800,000 here.

It is not &quot;human nature&quot; to destroy ourselves. It is the nature of a system that places profits over human lives.

China, with more than three times the US population has less than 5,000 recorded deaths, compared to more than 800,000 here. This is not to blame the American people, who have been fed lies, half-truths and anti-science backwardness, but rather those who are responsible. It is not &quot;human nature&quot; to destroy ourselves. It is the nature of a system that places profits over human lives.

				Covid is a medical issue. <br />The only sensible way to combat it is with science and medicine.<br />It is a threat and danger to all.<br />The more some make it a political issue or economic issue, the more chance it has to mutate into new strains. And that only serves to complicate eradicating it.<br /><br />Covid doesn&#039;t care about your agendas.... it kills!

				What a difference a couple of weeks made! In a most disturbing way, we have gone into a scary place once again. I am hearing that it is possible that in a couple of weeks this wave may have washed over us and leave. Good riddance. <br />&nbsp; Be safe out there everyone!

				Funny, I was just about to link to the NYT today:<br /><br />https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/22/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests/new-cases-slow-in-south-africa-suggesting-its-omicron-wave-may-have-peaked<br /><br />Gotta love the NYT.. always a week or two behind the actual facts. Cases and hospitalizations been dropping like a stone for like.. a week? in South Africa. Literally plunging. Pfizer covid pill just got FDA approval. We&#039;re seeing a completely predictable (and predicted) winter Delta wave, the same one that already tore its way through the Midwest.<br /><br />One thing is for sure though, the media will try to incite and create panic where none is needed. Another dumb headline in the Times said they spoke to &quot;more than two dozen people&quot; who are tired of Omicron. Um. Yeah. Stay smart, keep washing your hands, perhaps limit your indoor dining and activities and you&#039;ll see, this wave will peak and come down.

				&nbsp;Am watching the South African story closely and yes, it&#039;s almost half from a week ago with new<br />infections. My group of family and friends are being cautious but not shutting down and hopefully we can ride out this wave. The current news outlets definitely incite panic.

				Believe it or not, I&#039;m not a *it&#039;s just a flu* person. The only point of this limited and specific thread is that the dreaded omicron variant is a red herring, trumped up by doom-porn peddling news outlets. Now that the CDC has downgraded their *estimate of the Omicron percentage AND shortened asymptomatic to five days, I&#039;m sure cases and deaths will skyrockets right past the James Webb telescope. (Note my withering sarcasm)..&nbsp; long story short? Stay vigilant, get a booster, and live life!

				&nbsp;Thanks Chickenring. We&#039;ve been too just that. Hyper vigilant, mask wearing, avoiding congregant setting (except for the needed subway/bus rides) and knock wood, life goes on. <br />Relatives have spoken of growing up in areas of long term conflict in a similar way. Just putting one foot in front of the other and taking the necessary as best as possible.
