				Years ago, there was a proposal to make 37th one way eastbound and 35th one way westbound. The theory was that even if someone double parked there would still be room to pass. The city had done something similar in Sunnyside and it seemed to have worked.&nbsp; Many residents here loudly opposed it so the proposal was scrapped. I sometimes wonder if it would have made things better.

				i think a lot of the opposition came from people who live on 35th avenue - a group i am part of, though i didn&#039;t have a strong opinion one way or the other on this.<br /><br />the one way idea would seem guaranteed to alleviate congestion on 37th, but it would necessitate rerouting the buses that run along 35th, and, yes, it would lead to increased speeds on both avenues, despite the 115th&#039;s traditionally strong&nbsp; ::) enforcement of speed limits.

Emergency vehicles are slowed. DPing causes accidents, especially near intersections. It can make access to a fire hydrant impossible. Ppl/kids/animals not in the crosswalk are put in double danger. And what happens to bike lanes?<br /><br />One ways also contribute to air pollution as drivers who are trying to park legitimately are forced to circle twice the distance. <br /><br />Enforcement is the only really good option for a number of reasons, but it won&#039;t happen.<br />
