				Following up dssjh’s comment, I note that many businesses on that block have been shuttering. Next to the deli on 76th was Al Araf; that’s now closed. The building next to it was going to house Swim Two Birds; then there is the old photo shop; I noticed earlier this week that his window display has been removed, and looks like it’s in transition. Rico Tinto and Growing Farm have been shuttered today. That leaves the bodega and the laundromat, aside from the two corner businesses (HSBC and the deli on the corner of 76th. Looked that way and without having done any research, I wonder if other plans are afoot on that block.

				Al-Araf changed hands (I think) and is being changed to an Indonesian restaurant. I saw inside the other day, and it looks like the renovation is well along. That space has regularly changed hands over the past few years. I asked the proprietor of the bodega today if he knew anything about the closings, and he said no, but it&#039;s what happens when you don&#039;t pay the rent, and he went on a bit about how hard it is to pay everything you have to pay (including wages) to keep a business going. He said both Growing Farm and El Rico Tinto were good neighbors with nice owners. Maybe it&#039;s a cash flow problem and not permanent, we can hope, I guess. Soon we will have wall-to-wall pharmacies and banks and literally nothing else. The poster who said the whole block is closing exaggerated. There is still the corner deli and the pizza place, and -yes-the bank. I have to say that JH isn&#039;t even as bad as Manhattan in terms of empty storefronts now.It&#039;s a citywide problem.

				&nbsp;This is a real sad issue for the neighborhood. Personally, I have always paid rent or mortgage before anything else knowing that you can get booted out if you don&#039;t keep up with payments. But I know a number of people who do the opposite and some who withhold as leverage for getting things done. I like both Growing Farm and El Rinco Tinto alot and think they are stellar establishments as consumer for various reasons. Was recently on Metropolitan Ave near Forest Hills and they have some wonderfully diverse storefronts that look like they would be paying much lower rents than here.

				the rent was around 6000. that&#039;s probably pre increase, if an increase is in the picture. the GNC is now paying 9000, for a space that was 4500. heck, the dry cleaner that occupied the space before Paradise Biryani Pointe (which gave way to Al Araf) was paying $3000 before being priced out with an increase to $6000.

				Rico Tinto&#039;s closing is very upsetting.<strong>We always thought it was one of the best restaurants in Jackson Heights.</strong> We were there a week ago Saturday, introduced it to some friends, who loved it,&nbsp; and had a lovely conversation with the waitress and the chef/partner.<br />Along with the number of now-empty storefronts, as previously noted here lots of the older store signs were removed from the building and replaced with temporary-looking vinyl signs. Something is going on.

				What a load of BS! I live in the coop mentioned. Yes, we have been filing complaints against the landlord-- not the tenants-- of those shops--because he is not complying with regulations regarding the storage of garbage, which is resulting in a serious rat problem emanating from the alleyway behind those stores and traveling up the block. It&#039;s the landlord&#039;s responsibility to ensure that garbage be handled properly and according to city regulations. Nobody has ever singled out ERT or GF as offenders --in fact, I have heard it mentioned that the deli, K&amp;L, is not doing a good job with garbage. And nobody has closed down the deli, right? Plus these businesses have leases--I don&#039;t believe the landlord can shut them down because of a complaint about the storage of garbage by his tenants. The complaints are totally legitimate--we have called in city inspectors who have actually filed the complaints-- and they have zero to do with gentrification. The coop has been here since 1921, and many of the residents have been here for decades--dating from well before the recent influx of people from Manhattan and Brooklyn. Many are retirees, not hipsters from Brooklyn. I can&#039;t imagine who this poster is or why he/she would post a totally uninformed comment like this.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the most likely cause of the closings is a rent increase. Hopefully we will know more soon and maybe it can be worked out so the businesses can remain. They are both very well-loved businesses, and this just seems part of the overall problem of greedy landlords and tax laws that allow them to benefit via tax deductions by raising rents to unaffordable levels. To blame it on gentrifiers is absurd. Do gentrifiers want a bunch of empty storefronts instead of the excellent food and produce that those two stores provided? The only person who benefits from empty storefronts is the landlord who can take a tax write off, as I understand it.

				The landlord is &quot;76 01 37TH AVE REALTY&quot; and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to this page: https://www.newyorkbusinessgo.com/company/456613/.

				Maple - According to the online records I linked before, that corporation has owned the building since 1977, so records before then will be difficult to access.<br /><br />Jeffsayyes - I understand your claim that ERT was a gentrifying force, but I fundamentally disagree since the business catered to the neighborhood as it is, not to a clientele it wished for. All people in the neighborhood could be seen there and the atmosphere made people feel welcome.<br /><br />My original statement has been misconstrued: nowhere did I state or imply that white people were the ones to blame for their closing. As neighbors, we all contribute to and shape our neighborhood through our actions. I am against those who act to change the neighborhood into something they want it to be without consideration for (or inclusion of) the existing residents and cultures of Jackson Heights. These considerations are particularly relevant given the existing links between race, class, and power that have so indelibly shaped the history of New York and the country as a whole.<br /><br />To answer your question clearly: I am upset only with gentrifiers acting in bad faith (as defined in the above statement).<br /><br />Finally at this point, I realize that my commentary on gentrification, at large, maybe tangential to this particular thread. However, I feel that it was important to voice it in a broad setting. Most on the thread believe the closing of ERT is due solely to a rent increase, so I chimed in with information I gathered. The co-op complaints I spoke of were verified, though supposedly directed at the landlord rather than the business as I originally heard. Regardless, my source directly linked these complaints to the closing of the establishment. This, like all the other information we know about the situation thus far, is conjecture. Let&#039;s hope we can get closer to the truth.

				El Rico Tinto was a beautiful place. I met a lot of my Jackson Heights neighbors there. I remember sitting down for coffee one time and ending up in a long conversation with an older man about his first-hand experience with the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Another time--same thing, coffee and a conversation that ending up going for hours--with a woman who had been a go-go dancer back in the day. It was my favorite place to grab a cookie with the kids after school, and take my parents when they were visiting from out of town. The owner was friendly and would always give us updates about his daughter. And the food was so creative, fresh, and affordable.<br />The whole debate about whether ERT was a &quot;gentrifying force&quot; is silly. It was a neighborhood joint, a small business, an employer. I hope it isn&#039;t gone for good.<br />

				Yes the definition of &quot;gentrifying&quot; seems extremely elastic. I think of it more like when existing buildings are torn down so a huge new office or condo building can take its place. Some people seem to think of even a place like ERT, which offers a specific world cuisine in a nice setting with high quality ingredients, as &quot;gentrifying,&quot; simply because of the way it looks (nice, not ugly) and is not on the dirt cheap end of the price scale. They seem to think the neighborhood is at risk if it is not limited to the very cheapest and least fancy eating establishments possible. But yes, this is a neighborhood business, not a fast food chain, that appealed to a wide swath of the neighborhood. Why does that make it a &quot;gentrifying&quot; threat? And do people think of GF as a &quot;gentrifying&quot; business? It&#039;s absurd. And tying the garbage/rat issue to gentrification is also absurd. Don&#039;t lower income people wish to live rat-free, too?

This is further tinted by the innuendos and, sometimes, blatant remarks made regarding lower income people in some other threads on this forum. <br /><br /><br />To clarify, I support one&#039;s right to vocalize garbage/rat issues and it is completely reasonable for residents to want their premises maintain hygienic standards. But it baffles me that there is no consideration of the “potential” consequences of such legal action. In the context of gentrification, the greedy landlords and tax laws that benefit from removing smaller businesses for ones that can pay unaffordable rents, can and will easily take advantage of such complaints – so in essence the legal approach being used may play into their hands (knowingly or unknowingly). Who is leaving that garbage out there? Looks like some may like to now pin it on K&amp;L (jk – please, I beg, don’t take K&amp;L away too)<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not that was the cause of their closing, this is not a novel link between garbage/pest complaints and gentrification. In fact, this may be an interesting read for those shocked by the absurdity of the connection: https://nypost.com/2018/06/06/the-most-rat-infested-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city/<br /><br />Highlight: “I think there are a lot of neighborhoods that have a lot of rats but not a lot of 311 complaints,” ...“There are rats in almost every corner of certain neighborhoods, but people just don’t call 311 because they don’t speak the language or they find [rats] to be part of their daily lives living there. But as the neighborhoods are being gentrified, more people are saying, ‘Hey, I don’t want to see that.’ &quot;<br /><br />Otherwise, if ridiculous rent increase was the issue... we have gentrification sans rats. <br />

				Doesn&#039;t every single new business gentrify an area? Aren&#039;t they all trying to maneuver the neighborhood&#039;s tastes or needs into their own direction rather than the previous tenant? I just have a problem with people using the word &#039;gentrification&#039; as a catch-all for everything evil without nuance. Organizations like Queens Neighborhood United have their heart in the right direction but their mouths are using the rallying cry of Gentrification and anti-white rhetoric and it loses the real message (same with so many other bluntheads).

				What exactly is gentrification?<br />Gentrification is the phenomenon of affluent folks moving into less wealthy neighborhoods, renovating homes and attracting new businesses. ... Or, as summed-up by the Centers for Disease Control: “Gentrification is often defined as the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value.”<br /><br />Gentrification is a general term for the arrival of wealthier people in an existing urban district, a related increase in rents and property values, and changes in the district&#039;s character and culture. The term is often used negatively, suggesting the displacement of poor communities by rich outsiders.

				Well, you picked what is probably the second most expensive coop in the neighborhood after the Towers for your example, so it&#039;s not an apt example. <br />No one is arguing that prices are going up for real estate. But gentrification requires a location that has few amenities like supermarkets, drug stores and banks. We have more than we need. <br />For gentrification, commercial rents have to be cheap to allow for the places that start to change an under-served neighborhood (like cafes and hipster bars) that starts the cycle of rents starting to increase. JH has prohibitive commercial rents.<br />Call it what you want, but it ain&#039;t gentrification. All I&#039;m saying is that we are defining urban growth incorrectly when we call it gentrification. Bushwick is gentrifying. East New York is probably next. JH is not. Plenty of people get priced out of &quot;urban growth&quot; neighborhoods too, but it&#039;s still not gentrification.&nbsp;

				Actually, I picked Washington Plaza because it is an apt example of gentrification.&nbsp; Unlike the Towers, Hawthorne Court or the Chateau, it didn&#039;t start out as a coop.&nbsp; For decades it was a rental that served generations of middle class Jackson Heights families.&nbsp; It was recently converted into a high priced condo.&nbsp; Scores of rental units taken off the market and replaced by expensive condos.<br /><br />Maybe gentrification used to mean more affluent people moving into downtrodden neighborhoods without amenities, but does that definition still apply when condos in JH are selling for a million?&nbsp; Also, when I was in Park Slope 30 years ago, there were plenty of amenities.&nbsp; They just weren&#039;t the amenities that the new arrivals wanted.&nbsp; But the old residents, long gone now, wouldn&#039;t have traded the corner bodega for a shiny new health food store if they knew it was the beginning of the end for them (and, yes, the bodega that was on my old corner is now a health food store, and all the rental units in the surrounding row houses are expensive coops or condos).

				Just about when I moved into the neighborhood, a long-time standing Italian restaurant-bar, family owned, locally owned, located on 37th Avenue in the mid eighties, closed.

				I do not live in the co-op and therefore I don’t have enough information to decide whether or not to believe that there is a rat problem in the building. I have frequented the establishments in that building numerous times over the years and never encountered any rats. However, given logical reasoning, I do know that it would be fairly counter-productive for all of those who complained to waste that much time and energy if there was no problem to begin with. To quote my previous post: “To clarify, I support one&#039;s right to vocalize garbage/rat issues and it is completely reasonable for residents to want their premises maintain hygienic standards.”<br /><br />And since you ask, what <strong>could</strong> friendly neighbors have done <strong>instead</strong> of immediately filing numerous complaints against the landlord without concern for the stores that generate this garbage…<br /><br />Another, perhaps more harmonious, approach might be complaining but through more community-based, informal networks (i.e. talk to the super they seem to know, or the businesses directly – as they seem to have already identified potential culprits). <br />As I have previously stated, in line with the unpopular link I am considering on this thread, those in gentrifying neighborhoods might feel more comfortable accessing formal or legal means of action (i.e. 311) rather than actually speaking to their neighbors. <br /><br />For example, we have had issues with our neighbors about noise. Our first steps were to speak with the neighbor, and then the super - not jumping straight to calling the police or landlord. Had they not been cooperative, we would have followed through with legal means.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=18315.msg89237.html#msg89237">Quote from: jeanette on September 27, 2018, 08:19:34 PM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;people moving into a neighborhood and wanting it to change to accommodate them and their tastes.&quot;<br /><br />Jasonic, that&#039;s like saying don&#039;t move into a black neighborhood unless you want to live on fried chicken.

Sure kale is a superfood, but so are spinach and legumes - both of which are prominent in South Asian cuisine; so are several berry types - easily obtained (without sugar if you please) in the several juice/shake vendors in the neighborhood. JH is NOT a food desert - try out some of the healthy dishes at our Thai, Japanese, Tibetan, South Indian, Mexican, Peruvian, American ... places.<br /><br />And, I must note, it is quite inaccurate to assert that African-Americans live on fried chicken.

				<em>I do not live in the co-op and therefore I don’t have enough information to decide whether or not to believe that there is a rat problem in the building. I have frequented the establishments in that building numerous times over the years and never encountered any rats. However, given logical reasoning, I do know that it would be fairly counter-productive for all of those who complained to waste that much time and energy if there was no problem to begin with. To quote my previous post: “To clarify, I support one&#039;s right to vocalize garbage/rat issues and it is completely reasonable for residents to want their premises maintain hygienic standards.”<br /></em><br />Your suggestion that adjacent Hawthorne Court complaints resulted in the eviction of the two businesses is ridiculous. <br />I’m a long-time resident of the Court and here are some facts:<br />There was a serious rat infestation in the garden complex that peaked 2 years ago. Unsanitary conditions in the alleyway behind the storefronts were an obvious source of at least part of the problem. Open garbage, spilled cooking oil and most definitely rats regularly observed scurrying about. Calls to 311 were made, inspectors came out and working with the city, the coops and the commercial tenants the situation has improved. The alleyway is cleaner and rat sightings this past summer have been negligible. <br />The Marshall’s notices of eviction are most likely a result of non-payment of rent or business tax default. Certainly not because the landlord decided that those 2 out of the 5 food establishments on the block had to go because of neighbor complaints. <br />Ludicrous.

				I can&#039;t help but wonder.. especially since it&#039;s happening on another block just 10 blocks away..<br />could this be the beginning of an effort to push out those businesses and eventually tear down this two story building for <br />development into a higher-rise building?&nbsp; I doesn&#039;t seem like it&#039;s technically part of the &quot;historic district? -- any one know if it is?<br />imagine what the property would be worth to a developer looking to go tall.&nbsp; Plus as we saw with Target building, the city only<br />says YES to that idea in our neighborhood.<br /><br />

				Not sure if 37th ave is included in Historic District, but I know that it starts at 76th St literally in the middle of the street, with the houses on the east side of the street included and the houses on the west side of the street not included.So those businesses are east of 76th St--but not sure if the avenue is included or not. Empty storefronts all over the city are due to unsustainable rent increases, is my understanding. Doesn&#039;t an entire building usually get sold as a prelude to one of those development deals? As far as I know, there is one landlord who owns that entire retail block (on that side) and the building has not been sold. It&#039;s probably due to not paying the rent or the taxes, as a previous poster suggested.

Additionally, the owner also offered buyouts to tenants - I could have gotten 30K to move out and the larger apartments got even more.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d like to expand on that (especially because I wrote a response before I saw yours, Lilybell!).<br /><br />Most Washington Plaza tenants who rented pre-conversion are rent-stabilized. (I think there&#039;s at least one rent-controlled tenant.) But that doesn&#039;t mean their rents have stayed affordable. This is mostly due to the preferential rents Lilybell mentioned. With preferential rents, the landlord offers tenants a lease for somewhat less than what the law will allow (since the law might allow a higher rent than the landlord could get for the apartment). So there&#039;s the rent you pay, but there&#039;s also the higher rent the landlord <em>could</em> be charging you. Whenever you renew your lease, the landlord can raise you all the way up to the maximum rent allowed for your apartment. That can mean a sudden leap of hundreds of dollars. <br /><br />One reason landlords have wanted to offer preferential rents is that the legal stabilized rents become inflated due to the landlords&#039; practice of renovating kitchens and baths between tenants and then being allowed to increase the stabilized rent for doing it. Some landlords do this whenever an apartment is vacated in order to get a higher rent. The rate a landlord could legally charge might be $2400 but for that neighborhood and type of apartment, $1800 is the going rate, so the tenant gets a lease for $1800. But if the landlord wants to get rid of the tenant for some reason—say, for coop conversion, or because the tenant complains about repairs not being made, or lack of heat—whenever the lease comes up for renewal, the rent can legally be increased to $2400 (plus whatever yearly rent increases are allowable under stabilization).<br /><br />Landlords can also make major capital improvements that hike up the rent. This has been done at Washington Plaza. The landlord has been doing massive work for the past few years, like redoing the water pipes, replacing all the windowsills, replacing the walkways in the courtyard, and so on. Most of these things are considered MCIs. We have already gotten one MCI for the repiping and windowsills. I&#039;m sure there will be more coming for the courtyard walkways and other work that&#039;s in progress or planned, such as replacing fencing around the property and installing gates at the front of the courtyard.<br /><br />These things all add up. And many people can&#039;t afford to pay $50 more a month, much less $100 or $200. <br /><br />About the buyout offers, yes, a number of tenants took those. I&#039;m sure some were happy to take them because they were thinking of leaving anyway. But some took them because they had no choice—they couldn&#039;t afford to stay. (Most of the buyouts were $25K-$35K.)

				I used to live in Washington Plaza and moved last July. My lease was up in September and they could legally increase my rent from $1850 to $2650.

				If the landlord was getting violations and complaints due to bad managing of the garbage, that is definitely a reason for them not to want to want to renew the lease to ERT. I have worked in restaurants for years and where there is food, there are rats. While following the right steps to get rid of waste can definitely impact the amount of rodents, there will always be some present as long as there is food.Perhaps that block should not be packed with so many restaurants?
