				A female friend is considering moving to Jackson Heights, to an apartment in the area of 35th Avenue and 88th St. She is asking me about how safe she will feel walking home from the 7 train at night to that location, and I can&#039;t really say because I live in the mid-70s and have never used that subway station. I think there is also the option of taking a bus from the Roosevelt/74 St station to that location--isn&#039;t there? Can anyone advise on this?

				I&#039;ve come home pushing a double bass as late as 4 in the morning with no problems, either from the 82nd street stop or the 90th street, we&#039;re on 87th and 34th. Kate has come home pretty late (12 to 1 ish) with no problems. We&#039;ve been here since 2002.<br />(http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v424/bassbird/EdBassHamptonCt-1.jpg) (http://smg.photobucket.com/user/bassbird/media/EdBassHamptonCt-1.jpg.html)<br />

				Oh and yes, the Q49 goes up 35th Ave to 89th Street and then hangs a left.

				I lived on 88th and 37th for years. It was actually pretty safe, but it&#039;s not pleasant to take the train to 90th Street.&nbsp; And there have been some serious events at 90th street. <br /><br />&nbsp;I work long hours and would come home at 11-12 very often.&nbsp; There were lots of people on the street at that hour, but the week I moved there were two daytime violent attacks around 90th street station.&nbsp; That was last year, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s happening these days.&nbsp; I hated the 90th Street station so much, I now go to 82nd or take the bus from 74th.<br /><br />I am a recent convert to that bus, it&#039;s just much more convenient inbound to 74th.

				I live here too: Thanks for your comment. I also posted this question on another neighborhood listserv, and yours has been the only comment that said the 90th St. station is problematic. It&#039;s not clear to me: have you moved away from that location or are you still there but you now avoid the 90th St. station? Why is that station worse than the 82nd St station? More deserted? Most commenters are saying that there are lots of people at that station even late at night, and always others getting off the train and walking towards 37th. I&#039;m just wondering why you now avoid that station.&nbsp; And does the bus come pretty often?

				I&#039;ve been taking the 7 train to &amp; from 90th Street for the last 4 years or so. While it&#039;s mostly during the day, I sometime travel as late as midnight. <br />I have personally never felt threatened or worried at all from 90th St. Honestly, no one has really given me a second look. My only complaint is that the fruit stand there blocks the sidewalk sometimes. <br />But this is only my experience. I consider myself a fairly average man; a woman might have different experiences. <br /><br />Last year I came home as usual, and access to the north stairs was blocked off by the police, as was 90th bet. 37th &amp; Roosevelt. It turns out this happened:<br />http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130916/elmhurst/man-stabbed-death-near-elmhurst-7-train-station-anti-gay-attack-cops<br />Pretty horrible, of course. If my memory serves, there was then another murder a few days later on Roosevelt (I really don&#039;t recall the details) that might have been gang or revenge related. I don&#039;t know of any other similar serious crimes happening since, or in the few years before. <br />

I lived in&nbsp; the Bronx for twenty years, also coming home late at night; 90th street was worse in terms of overall experience. And yes, there were two daytime attacks the week before I moved over to 34th Street, and&nbsp; two-three years earlier (or thereabouts in terms of time), a young boy was murdered on Halloween by a gang. Most nights it was fine, I lived a five minute walk to my apartment and just put on autopilot. I&#039;ve been doing this late night urban walk home thing my entire adult life, I know how to handle myself. <br /><br />82nd street is not perfect, but it is generally cleaner because of the BID daily cleaning, the stores are higher quality. and I think it is on the upswing. I can stop at Rite Aid on my way home, or the health store. So personally, I&#039;d rather walk a little further to get home, to have a less stressful experience, at least in terms of my sensory experience.<br /><br />The Q49 bus doesn&#039;t come as often at night, you often have to wait for it, or sit in it, at 74th Street. I thinkit&#039;s every 10-15 minutes, which can be frustrating when you just want to get home. But it is an option.&nbsp; My husband and I have been taking it TO 74th street in the morning and taking the F to work, that has been infitely more reliable and faster than the &amp; train.

				I&#039;ve never had any problems commuting to/from the 90th St. station and have lived on 91st St. &amp; 34th Ave. for 6 years.&nbsp; My husband and I used to come home late at night fairly frequently (after having a baby, much less so) and always felt fine as there were plenty of people getting on and off the train at all hours.&nbsp; I probably wouldn&#039;t make the walk home by myself very late, like after midnight, but not because I&#039;ve ever felt unsafe--I just wouldn&#039;t do that in most neighborhoods.&nbsp; I take the Q49 now when it&#039;s cold/raining/snowing or if I&#039;m feeling lazy since it&#039;s only a block away and takes me to the express F.&nbsp; It takes about the same amount of time as walking to the 7 for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do remember that stabbing incident and really couldn&#039;t believe it at the time since, to my knowledge, nothing like that had happened in the time I&#039;d been living in JH.&nbsp; Pretty shocking that it occurred in broad daylight but I have to believe those kinds of crazy, rare events could happen just about anywhere.

				OK, I never had any &quot;problems&quot; either, I did it for 7 years. But 82nd street is generally less of a scene, with better stores etc. So whatever you&#039;re comfortable with.

				<br />Being a woman, and having lived very close to the area you are describing for 6 years, I have honestly never really felt unsafe. That&#039;s one of the great about this neighborhood.<br /><br />But my personal policy is that if I would arrrive at the 74th roosevelt station after 11pm, and felt too lazy to wait for a bus, I jumped in a car service, costs about $8-$10 to get to 88th &amp; 35th from that sta. <br /><br />
