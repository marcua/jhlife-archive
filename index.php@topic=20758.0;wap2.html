			I noticed a legal notice on the door of the restaurant that never opened called Swim Two Birds located at<br />7605 37th Ave.&nbsp; It was scheduled to open in 2016.&nbsp; The legal notice is from the landlord seeking $269,000 in back rent.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have a camera so I could not post the notice.&nbsp; Its a combination of a legal notice demanding payment and eviction.&nbsp; I&#039;m not certain when it was posted but I noticed it yesterday afternoon. <br /><br />I remember the owner Stuart was very sincere about opening and he did spend a significant sum of money renovating but was faced with many issues from NYC, the landlord and possibly the Liquor Authority.&nbsp; I don&#039;t remember all the details.&nbsp; There was a lot of excitement about this restaurant opening.&nbsp; Sadly, it never happened.&nbsp;

			it would have been nice to see the place open since it sounded like a very interesting concept, but Stew didn&#039;t do himself any favors by attacking pretty much everyone -- from the operators of longstanding restaurants to the community board members who had to approve his permits.

			I was going to say that with the demise of this site we will lose the fascinating Swim Two Birds saga--which I thought would make a great mystery-type podcast. So only now after 6 years is an eviction notice being served? The whole thing was so very strange. I wonder what Stew is up to nowadays. It was a sad tale, really.

			I recall seeing the interior of that space being amazingly renovated.<br /><br />Incredibly fancy. <br /><br />The next person who leases the space will have a maybe $250K (or more?) head start re:renovations.
