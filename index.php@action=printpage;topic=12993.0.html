				I received a call from a woman who googled my name and contacted me about an email exchange which the thought was coming from me.<br /><br />The sender stated that she was chosen as a candidate for the rent controlled property for a low monthly rent and proceeded to ask for a deposit and first month&#039;s rent. Because this woman happened to be looking for a rental she engaged in the exchange, then her husband found it suspicious and they searched and called me. I should add that the sender also created a fake email account through outlook using my last name. We reported it to Microsoft, and they took appropriate action on their end.<br /><br />This is obviously a new fishing scam which uses known agents names in <br />your area. Easiest way to detect them is that no office phone and address are in the signature line of the communication - which happens to be a legal mandate of the NY Department of State. When in doubt, call the brokerage main number to verify authenticity. <br /><br />If you have received similar emails please share them on this post as well.<br />

				that is dreadful.<br />back in the mid-&#039;90s, my ex and i owned a house on 75th street -- the one that she recently sold, as profiled in a times story a few weeks back. we lived in the duplex and rented the top floor apartment. we had friends live there at first, but needed to find tenants, placed an ad in the times and set up an open house. <br /><br />since we didn&#039;t put a &quot;no brokers&quot; caveat in the ad, a couple showed up to scope it out, hand us cards and so on. three or four days later, a young Mexican couple showed up at our door and asked for keys, saying they&#039;d rented the place using a broker claiming to work for a realty on Roosevelt avenue. they&#039;d given him first, last and security -- about four grand in total -- and we knew nothing about it. <br /><br />called the realty, they told us the guy had been fired for shadiness weeks before he pulled this scam. they weren&#039;t willing to even speak to the ripped off couple, who spoke very little English. we put them in touch with a lawyer and i hope they were able to find some resolution. they didn&#039;t get back in touch with us, so i think perhaps they did.

				I saw that an apartment was listed for rent in my building on CL, responded to the ad, and the Fake Outlook Armen replied! I didn&#039;t take it any further. This was mid-Feb. I hope you are able to get it cleared up, Armen.

				dssjh and Ms. Jackson<br /><br />Thank you for sharing! So far in the Email scams there is still lack of sophistication in the MO, so in most cases such as this past one and in the case of <strong>Ms. Jackson</strong> it does not go past an email exchange. But <strong>dssgh</strong>&#039;s case is far more concerning. My advice to all folks out there is to get complete contact information from any broker you come in contact with which <span class="bbc_u">must</span> include:<br /><br />1. Company name<br />2. Office address<br />3. Office phone number<br /><br />Only then you must get the <span class="bbc_u">agent&#039;s full name and number</span>. You can then check this information in NY Department of State records to verify authenticity and affiliation. Here is the direct link on DOS site: <br /><br />https://appext20.dos.ny.gov/nydos/selSearchType.do<br /><br />We ourselves once identified two <span class="bbc_u">unlicensed</span> individuals who represented themselves to be agents at a brokerage in Woodside by doing this search. A legitimate real estate license represents that an individual has passed all the state requirements and background checks in order to operate in the state of New York, and no individual without a license can transact any real estate business in the state of New York. <br /><br />Since agent information is public, it does not prevent criminals from exploiting it, therefore it is important that the word spread the word about these cases, and I thank you all for doing so!<br /><br />
