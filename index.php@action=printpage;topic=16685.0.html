				Good morning, <br />I said I wouldn&#039;t write to much on this list about my run for City Council...but a couple of neighbors have stopped recently and asked about it, and how they could help. <br /><br />If you&#039;re a registered democrat in any district you can help me petition, host a meet and greet, or contribute to the campaign- https://nycvot.es/2rUbPeD The campaign finance board matches contributions 6:1. <br /><br />I decided to run when Council Member Ferreras-Copeland bowed out two weeks ago. <br />The challengers, Hiram Monserrate and Francisco Moya are both career politicians. Monserrate having done some time in federal prison for fraud involving misused $100,000. He also has a domestic violence charge. <br />People love Hiram in the district, and the resounding call I hear on the streets is that he deserves a second chance. <br /><br />I was also dismayed by the fact that Assemblyman Moya would drop the important work he does in Albany to run locally. <br /><br />And, there&#039;s the sad situation of only 12 women in City Council... <br />I don&#039;t want to write too many policy initiatives here, but you can read about me and my concerns for the district at cristinafurlong2017.com . I also have fb, Cristina Furlong for District 21 and Twitter- D21Cristina<br /><br />I&#039;ll run on an agenda of rebuilding the safety, housing security, and quality education within the district. I&#039;ll be a council person directly involved in the community.<br /><br />The district only includes 81- 94th St, between Roosevelt and 37th- then expands to LGA, Flushing Meadows Corona Park and LeFrak City above Junction Blvd. <br /><br />Please write me, if you&#039;re interested in learning more or would like to help out. <br />Thanks.
