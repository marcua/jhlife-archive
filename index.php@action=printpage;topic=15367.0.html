				just wondering if i have to use their preferred mortgage broker/bank since it&#039;s a coop.&nbsp; I know that many credit unions do not offer loans on unwarranted condos and coops.&nbsp; How do I shop for best deals on mortgage?

				If it&#039;s their &quot;preferred&quot; broker, then I don&#039;t think you have to use them. <br /><br />To make sure you are getting the best deal, get a quote from several different banks.

				thank you for the input. My experience with unwarranted condo is that the preferred lenders sometimes are the only ones who would providing financing on that particular building but they have higher rates and fees.&nbsp; Does this apply to the Coops as well?

If it is the latter situation, run.

				As also a former mortgage lender for nearly a decade and now a real estate broker in Jackson Heights I can say this: <br /><br />1. to get the most favorable pricing on a coop loan, you want to be in a conforming loan with guidelines that would allow it to be sold to FNMA or Freddie Mac. Any portfolio loan product will likely be marked up on rate pricing, but the virtue of the fact it&#039;s a higher risk loan to the lender which they have to hold, at least until the project conforms to the federal agency guidelines. <br /><br />2. As a real estate broker in Jackson Heights (Historic District Specifically) specifically there are few non-conforming buildings that I&#039;ve run into. Most coops seem to have a pretty conforming structure. Unless it&#039;s a new conversion or it&#039;s a building that has a disbalance of rental to owner-occupied units, you should be able to obtain conventional financing.<br /><br />3. I&#039;ve seen sponsor contracts which stipulate a preferred lender in the contract as a default, in case your lender of choice (which you are free to choose) is unable to come through with the financing, as a way of keeping buyer with the deal if the main reason for the decline is project approval. <br /><br />Hope you find this information helpful.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen<br /><br /><br />
