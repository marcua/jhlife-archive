				I had one of my earliest crushes on a girl at 6 years old around 1958 with an older girl (by around 3 years) named Mercedes who occasionally helped her mother, my first grade teacher (as I remember). I thought Mercedes was beautiful and she was so nice to me. The next year Mercedes was not so nice and she threatened to beat me up a few times for something I did. That ended that crush and the last time I saw Mercedes was a few years later in 1964 or 65 or maybe it was 1966 when I went to play basketball at the PS 69 indoor ground floor court and some pretty girl who I didn&#039;t recognize came over to me with a smile and started talking. I said &quot;who are you&quot;. She smiled and said &quot;don&#039;t you recognize me?&quot; I took a long look and said unsurely &quot;Mercedes&quot;? She smiled and said &quot;yes&quot; and we had a nice long talk and she mentioned she was going to some performing arts school in Long Island. I never saw her again unfortunately but I never forgot that moment as that was really the first time I ever talked/flirted with a good looking teenage girl. Somehow like an idiot I never put two and two together until recently when I realized that she was Mercedes Rheul. I had seen her in many movies including The Fisher King and TV Shows and somehow never connected that she was Mercedes who I &quot;knew&quot; as a kid. Duh!<br />

				I fell in love with her when I saw her on Broadway in Neil Simon&#039;s &quot;Lost in Yonkers.&quot; She was, and still is a marvelous actress. I saw her recently in &quot;Torch Song Trilogy.&quot; She was hilarious.<br />
