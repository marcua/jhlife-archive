				<em><strong>I haven&#039;t gone to the Bx Zoo in a while<br /><br />I decided to take a few hours off and exercise a bit with my young son<br /><br />The place as you know is huge and almost 900 acres (as their famous saying states <em><span style="font-size: 11pt;" class="bbc_size">&quot;You cannot see it in one day&quot;</span></em> )<br /><br />Anyway - I have been there dozens of times before but now i started noticing things:<br />Architecture to be exact. &nbsp;I was flabbergasted at all the things I missed. &nbsp;I was impressed and I was proud to see such wonderful buildings in my place of birth (<span class="bbc_u">Callate Chuckster</span>! - NO I was not born in the Zoo - I was born in the BX -Geez - ADM) &nbsp;Sometimes we forget that the outer boroughs are part of NYC. &nbsp;What would NYC be without the Shea Stadium (oops - citifield - heh), Yankee Stadium (Imagine it being called JP Morgan or TD Field..heh) - BAM or Flushing Meadows Park. &nbsp;What about a NYC without Brooklyn Botanical or the Bronx Zoo.<br /><br />I could not help look and be awed at all the wonderful details I saw there. &nbsp;Is there any Zoo that can even come close in architecture and detail?<br /><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0567.jpg?t=1248919262) &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></strong></em><div align="center">(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0569.jpg?t=1248920111)</div><br /><div style="text-align: right;">(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0570.jpg?t=1248920154)</div><div align="center"><br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0574.jpg?t=1248920242)<br />(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0571.jpg?t=1248920189)</div>(http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr316/nycgotham/100_0578.jpg?t=1248920300)

				OMG Native!&nbsp; I would never suggest you were born at the zoo.&nbsp; &nbsp;:angel:&nbsp; I love the Bronx Zoo.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I was there last month with some friends!&nbsp; And you&#039;re right, the place covers a lot of area, so my advice to anyone going is to wear comfy shoes.<br /><br />Great pics!

				The zoo is awesome!&nbsp; Been going since I was a kid. My whole family has pix of us in the children&#039;s zoo where you put your head between those big ears. :D&nbsp; We took my bf there a couple months ago and made him get that pic taken too.<br /><br />Tiger Mountain is my favorite. :)

				Wow,<br /><br />I have much to say about the Bronx Zoo.&nbsp; First, just to be clear, I love it.&nbsp; Yes, even as a Vegan I love it.&nbsp; To fact check, the zoo is 250 acres.&nbsp; It is part of the great Bronx Park which also comprises the New York Botanical Garden and Fordham University.&nbsp; There are so many wonderful architectural elements about the Bronx Zoo.&nbsp; I did my senior thesis on the design of that zoo.&nbsp; A few things to note (of many).&nbsp; One of my favorite buildings in the entire city is there (perhaps the world)&nbsp; -- The World of Birds designed by Morris Ketchum, Jr. and Associates.&nbsp; From a bird&#039;s eye view it is a nest sitting on a hilltop aerie.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the NY Times Magazine did a great piece on this structure back in &#039;75? called Rara Avis.&nbsp; His firm also designed the now obsolete World of Darkness.&nbsp; The zoo is a design laboratory of zoological display over the past 100+ years.&nbsp; As a vegan I most understand why the zoo is there and I am in agreement.&nbsp; I interned at the zoo in 1981 at the World of Birds walking cranes.&nbsp; They would be bowlegged if they weren&#039;t exercised and thus unable to return to the wild.&nbsp; We introduced them back into the wild.<br /><br />I digress.&nbsp; Check out the sculptures of Anna Hyatt Huntington.&nbsp; Check out Jungle World.&nbsp; Check out the first exhibit of predator and prey ever on the African Plains.&nbsp; The Lions and the Antelope can eye each other.&nbsp; Bear in mind that it is only for our enjoyment and not so much for those well fed creatures there.&nbsp; That being said, anything that has people thinking about a greater engagement with the planet is good.<br /><br />Most of the pictures that I see on this website are of elements designed by Heins and LaFarge.&nbsp; This firm also did the subway stations along the original Broadway line.&nbsp; The exterior buildings you can experience are at Bowling Green, Astor Place and a few along the Upper West Side.&nbsp; Pretty Cool.<br /><br />Let&#039;s not forget our own WCS administered Queens Zoo.&nbsp; It is world class in its own right.<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about zoo design or the architecture of zoos around the world please let me know.

				<strong>Right you are 85Th.&nbsp; The Zoo itself is about 250 acres...it is the <span class="bbc_u">park</span> that is over 700 acres.&nbsp; I actually took more photos of the architecture than I did of the animals&nbsp; &nbsp;:D .</strong><br /><br />http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/bronxpark (http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/bronxpark)
