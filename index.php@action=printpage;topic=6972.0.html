				Dear Friends and Neighbors,<br /><br />We&#039;re thrilled to present the third installment of our Jackson Heights Trilogy, JACKSON HEIGHTS, 3AM! Our run in Jackson Heights is a bit shorter this time around, as we&#039;re at PS 69 for two weeks and then moving to Queens Theatre in Flushing Meadows Park for two weeks.&nbsp; We&#039;re very excited about the transfer, but also want to make sure that all of our Jackson Heights friends get to see the play while we&#039;re here!&nbsp; We&#039;ve had such amazing experiences researching the piece in Jackson Heights for the past 8 months!<br /><br />So....here is all the info! Tickets are available via our website, www.theatre167.org!<br /><br />Happy New Year!<br />Ari Laura Kreith<br />Artistic Director--Theatre 167<br /><br />***<br /><br />A new play inspired by late nights in the most diverse neighborhood in the world!&nbsp; From the creators of 167 TONGUES&nbsp;and&nbsp;YOU ARE NOW THE OWNER OF THIS SUITCASE...<br /><br />Theatre&nbsp;167&nbsp;in association with&nbsp;Queens Theatre is thrilled to announce the world premiere of <br /><strong>JACKSON HEIGHTS 3AM!</strong><br />Conceived and Directed by Ari Laura Kreith<br />Written by Jenny Lyn Bader, J. Stephen Brantley, Ed Cardona, Les Hunter, Tom Miller, Melisa Tien and Joy Tomasko&nbsp;<br /><br />At PS 69 in Jackson Heights Jan 13-Jan 22<br />At Queens Theatre in Flushing Meadows Park Jan 27-Feb 5, 2012<br /><br />A Bangladeshi cab driver working the midnight shift yearns for an Ecuadorian woman who rises at dawn to bake bread, but does not speak her language. A closeted policeman from Long Island comes to Jackson Heights for a date. &nbsp;At Club Atlantis, a drag pageant contestant has a run-in with one of her fans, while farther down Roosevelt Avenue a Russian immigrant discovers that redemption comes in the strangest ways. &nbsp;A rookie cop tries his best to do right by everyone, a beloved dog mysteriously disappears, and in Elmhurst Hospital a heartbroken ER doctor helps her patients fulfill their deepest dreams. &nbsp;Car dispatchers, sex workers, drag queens, E.R. doctors, gamblers, and insomniacs collide in the colorful world of Jackson Heights after hours.<br /><br />Seven playwrights explored the most culturally diverse neighborhood in the world from 10pm-4am&nbsp;â€” its brightest lights and loneliest corners â€” in dance clubs, all-night bakeries, sex shops, laundromats, side streets, and alleyways. They ate arepas prepared by the â€œsainted arepa ladyâ€ and, two blocks away, saw the homeless fed by the local hero a.k.a. â€œAngel of Queensâ€ under the elevated trains. They interviewed numbers-players, sex trafficking experts, bartenders, cops, and crossÂ­dressers. &nbsp;They were invited to dance, to gamble, and to watch an undercover police operation.&nbsp; And they were invited to let their imaginations run dark, funny, sexy, and very very late...<br />WARNING: This one&#039;s not for all ages.&nbsp;<br /><br />Co?produced as part of Queens Theatre&#039;s new play development program,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Immigrant Voices Project,&nbsp;JACKSON HEIGHTS 3AM will play January 13-22 at PS 69 in Jackson Heights and January 27-February 5 at Queens Theatre in Flushing Meadows Corona Park.&nbsp;Tickets for both engagements are $18.<br /><br />Starring Roberto Araujo, Varin Ayala*, Farah Bala*, Cynthia Bastidas, Rajesh Bose*, J. Stephen Brantley, Arlene Chico-Lugo*, Ross DeGraw*, Nick Fehlinger, Marcelino Feliciano, Kevin Hoffman, John P.
