				Has anyone else noticed that since Fresh Direst moved they have tanked.<br /><br />Scheduled delivery times are a joke.&nbsp; My 5 - 7 PM today, when I called at 7:30pm, was scheduled for 9:30 at the earliest.<br /><br />More items are missing from the order when delivered.<br /><br />Several weeks ago, only my frozen items arrived.&nbsp; The rest were lost.&nbsp; FD agreed to replace the order the next day, only some items were no longer available.&nbsp; Then they double billed me for a hand full or items.<br /><br />Too many items are unavailable without recourse ( I ordered 3 specific items I needed to make a particular dish, I got one; what was I supposed to do with it?)<br /><br />Is there another online vendor of quality?

				Yes! Delivery times haven&#039;t been a problem but missing items--with no notification--have been a real problem. Makes it difficult to plan a meal or recipe. There has been an improvement in my last few orders.

				Foodtown on 37th does computer orders too! They shop and deliver or you can pick up. The prices are the same in the store or online and you can shop the sales flyer. They call when something is not available and ask if you want to substitute. Delivery is usually a bit late, but lately they have been getting better.
