				Hi everyone--<br /><br />My husband, son, and I will be moving to JH in October. We are looking <br />for a nanny to take care of our son, who will be 5 months in Oct, three <br />days a week (Tuesday, Thursday, Friday for about 9 hours/day). We will <br />most likely only need a nanny until March, when we can enroll him in day care. <br /><br />If you, or anyone you know, would be interested please e-mail me and I <br />can give you more info. <br /><br />Thanks!<br />Versha<br />

				I&#039;m only aware of one.<br />She was working in a bridal shop in Flushing, Queens, <br />Til her boyfriend kicked her out in one of those crushing scenes. <br />What was she to do, where was she to go <br />She was out on her fanny. <br /><br />So over the bridge from Flushing to the Sheffield&#039;s door, <br />She was there to sell make up but the father saw more, <br />She had style, she had flair, she was there, <br />That&#039;s how she became the Nanny. <br /><br />Who would have guessed that the girl we described <br />was just exactly what the doctor prescribed? <br /><br />Now, the father finds her beguiling, watch out C.C., <br />The kids are actually smiling, such joie de vivre <br />She&#039;s the lady in red when everybody else is wearing tan. <br />The flashy girl from Flushing, the Nanny named Fran :D<br /><br />Honestly, I&#039;ll ask around in my building for you.

				Thanks for the poem, Birch-Ed!&nbsp; Actually, we&#039;ll be living in the Birchwood House.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s where your name comes from.

				I just wanted to say that some licensed family day care providers will take children that young.&nbsp; I am very very happy with my family day care provider.&nbsp; She says she has taken kids as young as 4 months, but she doesn&#039;t have any openings right now.<br /><br />At first I thought I was going to get a nanny because I thought it was the best thing to do.&nbsp; But honestly, I am so glad that my daughter is interacting with other kids.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although 5 months is too young to really interact, the baby can watch the other kids, and he will probably learn quite a bit... especially if he is an only child.<br /><br />If you are interested, you can get a list of family day care providers by calling 311.&nbsp; You will find a LOT of differences in terms of style, environment, size of group, age of kids, philosophy, etc.&nbsp; I interviewed nannies and visited day care centers before I started visiting family day cares, and the first few that I visited did not impress me.&nbsp; Then I found the right fit!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Good luck with your search!

				I would actually have loved to put my son in family day care, and I think I called all of the ones that are within walking distance of our new apt.&nbsp; Unfortunately, none are taking babies right now.<br /><br />He&#039;s at a day care center right now, and I wanted to start him at Rainbowland right when we moved, but they only take kids who are 9 months+.&nbsp; Hence the need for a temporary nanny!&nbsp;
