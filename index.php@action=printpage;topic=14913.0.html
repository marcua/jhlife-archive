				Recently, a few friends decide to start a book club. we all live in different parts of New York City. (Long Island, Manhattan, Brooklyn) The traffic &amp; commute has made it difficult for us to gather together to discuss the books we read.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are there any book clubs here in JH or nearby? I would love to join one in my own neighborhood. <br /><br />Thanks!

				I was in one in JH a few years ago, that did not work out. Would be interested to try again. It&#039;s important that members be on the save wavelength in terms of reading tastes. For example, the organizer of the club I was in first proposed Fifty Shades of Grey. This should have tipped me off that this was not the right group for me. This person also seemed to want to segregate by age--she put up a flyer that solicited new members and noted: &quot;Average age of the group mid-20s to 40.&quot; Since I am considerably older than this range, and was by far the oldest member of the group, I interpreted that as a message: we don&#039;t want old people. Am I wrong to take it that way? That was the final straw for me, and I dropped out. Eventually everyone did, and the group no longer exists. There are many mixed-age book groups. My sister upstate belongs to several with a wide range in age. I think this person was looking for other single women friends, like her, and/or dates in forming a book group for which she seemed to want to dictate the age range of members. (Not to mention the taste displayed by her suggestion for the initial book...ugh...) Thanks for letting me vent!<br />

				Kscher, if you are willing to start a new book club, there are 4 of us so far who would definitely be interested and I would gladly assist in starting up this book club. I will email you my email address if you want to discuss further. <br /><br />ljr, sorry you had to experience age discrimination with that individual. I personally prefer members ranging from all ages which would make it much more interesting when discussing books. <br /><br /><br />

				My local-ish (mostly Astoria) book club devolved into a Facebook discussion group. We talk about what we are reading/plan to read and when a few of us sync up, we&#039;ll meet for a discussion. My previous forays into a book club ended in the similar fashion of others: series of books picked I had no interest in reading (50 Shades, Deborah Harkness witch series).

				Have enjoyed reading all the comments but let&#039;s take some action. I&#039;ve been looking for a diverse book club too.<br /><br />How&#039;s about meeting <strong>Sunday June 5, 4 p.m. at Espresso 77</strong>. And please buy a drink, Afzul runs an establishment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bring your ideas, suggestions for the first book and a place to meet, all ages, all sexes, etc, all smiles welcome....

				I would be willing to set up a Facebook group to get this organized.. definitely seems like there&#039;s some interest in the forum. I&#039;m curious to see what types of books other&#039;s would want to read and discuss. I think as long as there&#039;s some common interest, anyone should be invited to join! <br />

				82oldie, thank you for taking the bull by the horn by arranging the date &amp; location for our first ever JH Book Club! I&#039;m looking forward to it. <br /><br />Emliv85, a Facebook page is such an excellent idea. It will provide a forum for us to plan &amp; discuss. Once you create the Facebook page would you please post the link here. <br /><br />I want to echo what 82oldie previously said, ALL are welcome just bring a smile&nbsp; :)

				Will the book club be discussing a book on the 4th?<br /><br />If not, and it&#039;s planning, may I suggest as a book club organizer, everyone be prepared to suggest a book, and then all those in attendance vote for their choice and pick a date/time. (My experience is if you don&#039;t nail down the details for the next meeting at your current meeting, things just fall apart. And, it gives people an incentive to participate and attend if those at the meetings are the ones doing the choosing.) Things to consider when pitching a book: length; length of time until the discussion; availability (is it in paperback? How many are in the Queens Library system?); subject matter and how it lends itself to discussion.

				May I suggest that you put out a small list of potential books you are interested in reading for the book club? Rather than guessing tastes by age, race, or creed, this would get to the heart of the shared direction of the group.

				I&#039;ve created our facebook page! You can visit here: https://www.facebook.com/JHbookclub<br /><br />Please let me know if you&#039;re interested in editing/admin&#039;ing for the page, and I can add you to that role.<br /><br />I unfortunately won&#039;t be able to make the first meeting on Sunday, but it would be great if someone could recap and post the book that we&#039;ll be reading and when the next meeting will be. <br /><br />My suggestion would be to pick a theme ahead of time, we can post the theme on the facebook page and members can suggest a book in that theme to read for the following month. I just came across this list on Buzzfeed that has me a little intrigued: https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/criming-while-true?utm_content=bufferc055e&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=pinterest.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_term=.oxj93QYQK#.ngYryKjKL (https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/criming-while-true?utm_content=bufferc055e&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=pinterest.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_term=.oxj93QYQK#.ngYryKjKL)

				I&#039;d encourage the organizers of the group think about what the mission of the group is.<br /><br />The book club I run is about meeting new people who share an interest in books, while also expanding our reading horizons. So, this manifests itself in a couple of ways: I want active participation from members for book suggestions so we all get to read things that we might not normally pick up; if someone hasn&#039;t finished a book in time for the club, that&#039;s fine as long as they understand the discussion will include spoilers; and hating a book so much the person can&#039;t even finish it is a perfectly valid experience of a book - just be able to articulate what you hated and listen to what others enjoyed or got from it.<br />

				Not sure where the person who said let&#039;s meet at 4PM, June 5th at E77 was, but there was a small group who did indeed meet. Actually there were three of us who showed up because of this thread, and then we found a fourth who happened to be sitting at the table who was interested in joining. So we have begun. If others from this thread are interested, PM me and I will provide details on what we decided to read and when we decided to meet.<br />

				This is awesome. Anyone up for starting a bookstore/cafe? I can get used books cheap. Though they don&#039;t make much profit, they are a value added for anything else in the store because they draw people in. Great way to sell $3.50 cappuccinos.

				Link appears to be broken, so probably not.<br /><br />I considered moving my book club to FB but decided against it in the end. People treat like FB events they&#039;ve RSVPed pretty casually, which is really pretty disrespectful on a small and local level for whoever is taking care of logistics of the meeting.

				I&#039;d be interested as well; however, not really a fan of Espresso 77 since they wanted to charge me a $1.00 extra to have 1/2 &amp;1/2 in my cappuccino.&nbsp; If you find yourself at a different venue, I&#039;d be interested in knowing.&nbsp; I would even be happy to host occasionally if it gets off the ground.

				The FB page for the book club was originated by people who subsequently dropped out of the book club, so it&#039;s not an active page anymore. But the club is still active and new people do keep joining up. It winds up being about 8 people at each meeting. Click on the link posted above to get on the mailing list.
