				Real estate prices are definitely not decreasing evenly in NYC.<br /><br />Tiny Manhattan apartments which are pointless to live in now with everything around them closed or dangerous have been losing a lot more value than other parts of NYC.<br /><br />Jackson Heights prices seem pretty flat so far, sometimes up a little, sometimes down a little. Houses/townhouses/etc are especially in demand. Apartments might be a little down, although there are probably a lot of people still drooling over how big the apartments are here compared to Manhattan.<br /><br />And most of the shops and restaurants are still open here, which is pretty handy

				There used to be a lot of good reasons to prefer living in Manhattan to the rest of NYC but over the past 6 months those reasons have mostly all ceased to exist. It doesn&#039;t seem so strange for prices in Manhattan to be behaving differently now.<br /><br />I agree that prices in Jackson Heights could fall over the next few years (probably - but who knows).

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to speak about the market as a whole now, but I can speak from direct experience with our own Jackson Heights portfolio. <br /><br />Recently, most (not all) our properties traded with a 20-30k discounts in comparison where they would have traded before the pandemic. They all started listed at pre-pandemic prices. Some sellers also adjusted pricing in 20-30k range. As more properties sell and come on/off market, we will be able to tell IF we are on continuous downward trajectory OR the 20-30k range is the extent of the COVID era market correction. <br /><br />Ahead of us are elections, hopefully a vaccine and what will ultimately be the post-vaccine economic report. These are all moving parts that based on outcome, will move the market needle.

				Are you mostly listing smaller co-op apartments?<br /><br />I wonder why Redfin and Zillow think that prices are still up overall in Jackson Heights. Besides buyers driving up prices of houses/townhouses/etc, maybe more larger homes are being sold in Jackson Heights than usual?

				20k-30k is only a problem for a recent purchaser in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />The real problem for the real estate is the non-liquidity.<br /><br />Right now, very few people want to enter the market.<br /><br />Just using my own apartment as an example, the price has been doubled after the past seven years. I&#039;m even willing have to 10% drop if it can be sold right away so that I can purchase a bigger apartment with the proceeded sale.<br /><br />However, if I put the apartment for sale, it is going to be involved with a lot of work. Say with 10% drop and some buyer jumped in. Due to the long process, if the buyer wants to back down his purchase due to the price further drop, (there is some legal protection to prevent this to happen, but I&#039;m not going to be dragged into a legal battle who only profits the lawyers),&nbsp; I&#039;m back to square one.&nbsp;

				I know someone with a large, highly desirable apartment in JH who recently listed it for sale--and had a buyer lined up right away. This narrative that has &quot;everyone&quot; fleeing NYC seems quite exaggerated. The only people I know who are leaving are doing so to be closer to family--kids or parents--at a time when travel has become more difficult. Not because NYC is &quot;dead&quot;. The person who listed their place is not leaving NYC either--only moving to a larger space (a house) in another neighborhood.

				You are the one ignoring facts and generalizing. <br /><br />It looks like Armen has only been selling 1 and 2 bedroom co-op apartments.

				According to the realtor that has my 1 BR listing, houses in Jackson Heights are doing well but not cooperatives especially studios and 1 BR&#039;s.&nbsp; Since I listed 42 days ago, I&#039;ve reduced my price three times for a total of $30,000.&nbsp; Its just 42 days, so I remain patient.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the cooperative market continues to remain weak, I&#039;ll remove my listing late next month.&nbsp;

				Categorizing 1 and 2 bedroom apartments together makes no sense. One-bedrooms have always been harder to sell to my knowledge--I think there are more of them (high supply, less demand) and larger units are more desirable in general, even more so with work and school at home for the time being. So 2-bedrooms would sell faster than 1-bedrooms or studios. The unit I mentioned in this thread is a 3-bedroom, and those are still snapped up quickly. I will be interested in the ultimate price--the listing was just as high as it would have been before the pandemic.

				I can only speak about co-op apartments - I&#039;m noticing that those sellers that are willing to reduce their asking prices are selling their apartments and those that are defiantly sticking to pre-pandemic pricing are not. 1 bedrooms in desperate need of a renovation shouldn&#039;t be asking over $400,000 in Jackson Heights now and I&#039;d argue that they shouldn&#039;t have been last year.

An apartment in my building went into contract in October and did not close until May. I&#039;m guessing there were other factors that delayed the closing, but the pandemic definitely didn&#039;t help. I was surprised by the relatively high price that apartment sold for.

				^do you think it possible the closing on the apartment was delayed due to the pandemic and the price reflects a pre-pandemic offer? I&#039;d be curious what someone knowledgeable about real estate contracts would say about if Covid could be a legit reason to break a contract and get a deposit back?<br /><br />An apartment in my coop sold in July for a price that reflects closing prices from early this year. I wonder if the offer was made in Feb/early March or possibly earlier. I recall it took us a good 3+ months to go from offer being accepted to closing on our apartment.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">An apartment in my building closed in June at the price it was listed at before the pandemic.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				^thanks for the tip. It wasn&#039;t on StreetEasy, but I did find it listed as sold on another site with less than 80 days on the market. So if closing date was in July, I guess that means it went on the market some time in May-ish.

				There are 3.4 million apartments in NYC.<br /><br />At least 1/3 would be 1 bedroom or studios.

				That depends.&nbsp; If I combined with the unit next to mine, I&#039;d have 3 good sized bedrooms, 2 baths, living room and dining room.&nbsp; Combined maintenance would be @ $800 which I&#039;m guessing is quite a bit lower than most 3 bedrooms.&nbsp; Would run into extra costs renovating......especially turning one kitchen into a bedroom.

They all started listed at pre-pandemic prices. Some sellers also adjusted pricing in 20-30k range. As more properties sell and come on/off market, we will be able to tell IF we are on continuous downward trajectory OR the 20-30k range is the extent of the COVID era market correction. <br /><br />Ahead of us are elections, hopefully a vaccine and what will ultimately be the post-vaccine economic report.

Appraisals really are divided into purchase appraisals and bank refinance appraisals. In a purchase it&#039;s a bit simpler, because in a purchase we have a contract price, which the bank appraiser must justify by comps and agree with contract price value.

Happy to answer. <br /><br />Appraisals really are divided into purchase appraisals and bank refinance appraisals. In a purchase it&#039;s a bit simpler, because in a purchase we have a contract price, which the bank appraiser must justify by comps and agree with contract price value. In refinance appraisals, the value is pulled through a &quot;lottery&quot; of similar comps. I find refinance appraisals to be far more conservative than purchase appraisals. <br /><br />One very important point: It&#039;s important not to mistake an appraiser&#039;s price opinion for market value. Only buyers&#039; value perception drives the actual market value of an apartment.<br /><br />Since most of last 6-12 months sale closings are of units that entered contract PRE covid, those comps are very healthy and do not reflect the impact of the covid dip. As more post covid deals close, harder it will be to drum up comps as values begin to rise again. <br /><br />I am wondering however, what position lenders will take on comp properties that went into contract and closed during the pandemic. If they will look at them at face value, or factor in a credit for pandemic era dip. I think that will depend on how soon we will see a rise in prices after end of the pandemic. If say pandemic ends and prices remain unchanged for another year or so, then those comps will likely be taken at face value. <br /><br />Globally, for now, I can say that we don&#039;t have underappraisal concerns on properties that sell at a slight discount during covid. Those prices are easy to justify due to past 6-12 month closings. <br /><br />I hope this is helpful.<br /><br />Warmly,<br />Armen
