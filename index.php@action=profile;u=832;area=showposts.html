&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;I LOVE A MYSTERY&#039; - - PART 1<br /><br />Here is an interesting observation that I will share with you all, reflective of what is common in human nature, and detrimental to human progress:<br /><br />I have posted an offer of my services, in response to someone&#039;s inquiry regarding dog care, with a brief sketch of my qualifications (and an invitation to contact me for more information).&nbsp; I have offered the *good* news - - that a kennel is not your *only* option for boarding your pet.&nbsp; I have offered *good* and valid information.&nbsp; I have extended a *good* option to you and given you a *good* lead on services that exist (and, in fact, could direct you to a far, far better and more exclusive *kenneling* situation, if your dog would not be suitable for home-boarding, than the *commercial* one you are using).<br /><br />Thus far, I have gotten *three* *NEGATIVE* responses&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; NO positive response, no neutral response (say, a question or two, perhaps). - - but three negative responses.<br /><br />*NOTICE* - - that nothing that I wrote would, rationally, elicit such a negative response (but from, perhaps, a kennel owner), and it would seem contrary to logic, to respond in such a hostile, adversarial, and negative manner, to a *gift*.<br /><br />The lack of receptiveness to this, and to the entire prospect of gaining new knowledge, is striking.&nbsp; The three people who have responded (negatively) do not want to know more, they are apparently satisfied with what has been convenient for them, and they seem very threatened, in fact, by the prospect of something that challenges their preconceived notions, most particularly, it would seem, the one concerning whether or not they have, up to this point, been doing the *best* they could do with the arrangements they have made for their companion animals.<br /><br />One person has accused me of being &quot;condescending&quot; because I have provided information.&nbsp; She asserts that I have *assumed* that she is ignorant, uninformed, and incompetent - - yet, inherent and intrinsic to the very conversation that we are having - - about *kennel* boarding - - she *proves* that this is so.&nbsp; Otherwise, she would know, as my clients do, about in-home boarding, she would be boarding her dog with a competent home-board and not a kennel, and we wouldn&#039;t be having this conversation!<br /><br />She clearly has *not* done &quot;the best&quot; in researching her options, she has *not* done her &quot;homework&quot;, she does not like having this revealed to her, and considers the information I have provided a personal affront to her dignity (the hell with what&#039;s best for the dog, at this point!).<br /><br />This does not, however, discredit the information, nor should it disuade those inclined to take a more pro-active and successful approach to the introduction of new and better resources, from availing themselves of accomodations that might better facilitate their purposes (such as the gentleman who was concerned with doing business with someone who could be relied on in emergencies).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s fun to talk down to someone who knows more than you do, from the safe anonymous concealment of the internet - - but this is not productive; it will not be of any assistance to anyone, or their dogs.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, am *not* anonymous.&nbsp; I have put myself out here, and stand by the information I have given you, *by name*, and with traceable references.&nbsp; My qualifications, going back over thirty years, attest to my expertise in my field.&nbsp; It is then *curious* that anyone with less qualification would attempt to do anything but *learn*, and utilize that information that they have gotten from me to increase the efficiency of their performance, but would prefer, instead, to take meaningless pot-shots at me, by way of justifying their choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Oh - - you say you&#039;re doing everything *perfectly*, with *no* room for improvement?&nbsp; Gee - - wish I were *you*!).<br /><br /><strong>Before you reject something good that&#039;s offered to you, such as the information I am giving you - - ask yourself *WHY* you&#039;re doing that</strong>.&nbsp; (Just a little *behavioral* thing - - but as a behaviorist, I think we should all be more *aware* of our motivations).<br /><br />Here is one of the reasons why I prefer spending my time with dogs!&nbsp; They make more sense than many people do, and don&#039;t usually fight you when you&#039;re offering something nice.<br /><br />As long as Buddy (I believe it was) has quoted *Shakespeare*, perhaps I should cite a far more pertinent quotation, from the Bible; Matthew: 7:6<br /><br />&#039;Do not throw bread to dogs, or pearls to swine&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Stay tuned for Part 2.<br /><br />[/i]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;I LOVE A MYSTERY&#039; - - PART 2<br /><br />As I have been confronted with the assertion that I know &quot;nothing&quot; about a specific venue that has become the topic of this discussion, and I, in return, have accused some of you of not doing your &quot;homework&quot;, I felt it fair to do a little research on CBW; research that took me all of *five* minutes, to find the truth about the operation of this establishment (that you, too, can research for yourselves, in the same five minutes; you don&#039;t have to take my word for anything).<br /><br />The results of my five minutes of research were quite disturbing, but not uncommon.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take a look; shall we?&nbsp; (And I&#039;ll play this backward, just to keep it interesting, as a mystery should be).<br /><br />&quot;Camp Bow Wow - - North America&#039;s Premier Doggy-Day And Overnight Camp&quot;, is the header on the homepage of the Long Island City CBW website.&nbsp; And let&#039;s STOP RIGHT THERE for a moment, to examine this claim!<br /><br />WHO says this about them?&nbsp; Other than the *hype* that they, themselves, generate, WHO makes this claim about CBW?&nbsp; (And, by what criteria, in any case?!).&nbsp; *NO ONE*!&nbsp; NO ONE says this about them, other than themselves!&nbsp; There is *NO* ENDORSEMENT to back this spurious claim!&nbsp; *No* humane society, *no* animal-advocacy organization, *no*animal-oriented association, no animal-oriented publication!&nbsp; ABSOLUTELY NO ONE connected with anything that has anything to do with *animals*.<br /><br />They, further, say that they have been &quot;featured in newspapers, magazines, and on television shows&quot;, as &quot;a wonderful alternative to the traditional kennel&quot; (I, personally, fail to see the difference).&nbsp; BUT THEY DON&#039;T SAY *WHICH ONES*!!!&nbsp; *WHAT* newspapers?&nbsp; *WHAT* magazines?&nbsp; *WHAT* t.v. shows?&nbsp; Do you know how quick and eager commercial businesses are to cite specifics, in regard to such things, when they have something to tell, and names to drop?&nbsp; Holy cow!&nbsp; This is *why* businesses seek publicity - - so that they can promote themselves with it - - *specifically* and *by name*!!&nbsp; *WHY* would *this* business make such claims - - yet be so vague?&nbsp; The mystery deepens!&nbsp; Until you look into their &quot;PRESS&quot; section.&nbsp; But let&#039;s save that, for a moment; shall we?<br /><br />First, let&#039;s go back and look again at that home page, and what it advertises, which is contrary to one of the issues we&#039;ve been discussing:&nbsp; bloat.&nbsp; They say that they feature *&quot;ALL DAY PLAY&quot;*, and they show, in one photo shot, a small, inflatable, child&#039;s wading pool, filled with water.&nbsp; For all intents and purposes, that&#039;s some big, available water dish, probably loaded with bacteria, too, and BANG!&nbsp; Your &quot;bloat protocol&quot; is dead!&nbsp; The lecture and the handout on the subject?&nbsp; That&#039;s *their* liability disclaimer; demonstrably, it has no bearing on the true nature of the situation, or care of your dog.&nbsp; (Add a little something, here: Giardia.&nbsp; Small, common pools like these can be a hotbed of Giardia.&nbsp; And if you&#039;re not lucky, *you* and your dog can get to share something known as &quot;ping-pong Giardia&quot;!&nbsp; What fun!!).<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look into that &quot;Press&quot; section on that website, and see where those mentionable &quot;features&quot; have been.&nbsp; As I&#039;ve pointed out, there haven&#039;t been any endorsements from any sort of *dog* or *animal* associations; with all their elaborate internet *crap*, they fail to be endorsed by ONE valid source - - so what &quot;newspapers&quot;, &quot;magazines&quot;, and &quot;television shows&quot; are they talking about?<br /><br />And it&#039;s just *UNBELIEVABLE*!&nbsp; *ALL* of their &quot;press&quot; has been in *BUSINESS* publications!!!!!!!&nbsp; NOWHERE are they touted as animal-care specialists - - - but as *BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS*!&nbsp; <br /><br />They are referred to as a &quot;franchise SYSTEM&quot;; they&#039;re an &quot;industrial&quot; system, that boasts &quot;over 200 CBWs across the country!&nbsp; (All staffed by *incompetents*!!&nbsp; HOW do I know this?&nbsp; No one competent would work in a system like this!).&nbsp; <br /><br />All you see on their websites is the word &quot;BUSINESS&quot;, over and over again!&nbsp; *They&#039;re selling FRANCHISE BUSINESSES*; *that* is their primary interest, not dog care!&nbsp; That is what their websites are designed for.&nbsp; That is what their de facto businesses are designed for.&nbsp; They are a *pyramid* operation!&nbsp; (More on this, shortly).<br /><br />And it gets better.&nbsp; Curtis Moore, the guy behind this &quot;entrepreneurial business&quot; is a retired marketing strategy / entrepreneurship expert from Lucent, a giant technologies conglomerate.&nbsp; He worked there until 1996.&nbsp; He is assisted in his endeavors by his wife, who retired from MCI Technologies in the year 2000.&nbsp; NEITHER OF THESE PEOPLE WERE IN ANY PROFESSIONAL FIELD CONNECTED WITH ANIMAL OR DOG CARE, *EVER*.&nbsp; (Except for a summer, long ago, during which this character worked as a kennel-boy).&nbsp; HIS FIELD OF EXPERTISE IS NOT ANIMAL CARE, BUT BUSINESS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES.<br /><br />But that&#039;s not all.&nbsp; He has some very interesting side-line businesses, that may shed some light on the operations of CBW, as a corporate entity.&nbsp; *Brian, pay attention; I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be thrilled!*<br /><br />If you follow the very clear and frank path (this guy isn&#039;t hiding anything; he relies on your ignorance; he&#039;s right in your face, and insulting your intelligence!) you will find that he is also running a *puppy mill*!&nbsp; That&#039;s right!&nbsp; He breeds poor specimens of lousy, probably unsound, dogs (Bichons [unrecognizable as Bichons, by the way; looking like Maltese!] and Corgis) that are not exhibited (shown) or tested for genetic disease.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t go to the trouble or *EXPENSE* of having good stock, or exhibiting his dogs, but he does charge the unaware and unwary &quot;show quality&quot; prices for them!&nbsp; AND, he boasts, on his website, that he uses *Diamond* dog food (the very first brand to poison so many dogs, with terrible ingredients from China!) - - *meaning* that *he doesn&#039;t even so much as pay to *feed* his puppy-mill dogs*; for that mention, he gets his feed without charge from the company that makes it!&nbsp; (I&#039;m liking this guy less and less!).<br /><br />But it&#039;s not over yet!!!&nbsp; Because our CBW developer has yet another sideline business he&#039;s been working on!&nbsp; He&#039;s cashing in on the craze for organic beef, by breeding &quot;organic&quot; Lowline Black Angus cattle, for consumption!!!&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; know what &quot;organic&quot; means, when you live in Texas, and you&#039;re raising cattle?&nbsp; It means that they live outdoors and eat grass, which grows for *free* in the great state of Texas, where there&#039;s hardly any winter, and the costs of such an operation amount to not much more than the cost of the land itself, yet have high yields in the marketplace!&nbsp; (While we&#039;re at it, for those who think &quot;green&quot;, raising cattle is one of the most exploitative, planet-violating things you can do!). <br /><br />So - - a pattern emerges:&nbsp; here we have someone (who specializes in *marketing strategy* and *entrepreneurial development*) who runs three separate businesses that all *EXPLOIT* animals, and makes his income at the *expense* of animals.&nbsp; And his crowning achievement, thus far, is CBW, cited and written up, for being a marvelous entrepreneurial pyramid-system franchise *industry*, that has generated &quot;over 200 locations across the country&quot;, since 1996, started with income from his puppy mill (the &quot;breeding program&quot; referred to in the warm, fuzzy story of how Moore turned certain aspects of his business over to his wife, when she retired, in 2000).&nbsp; <br /><br />Returning to the issue of Mr. Moore, and CBW&#039;s press, I would direct you to the coverage that they&#039;ve gotten on Merchant&#039;sCircle - - *not* &#039;DogCircle&#039;, or &#039;AnimalCircle&#039; - - *MERCHANT&#039;s*Circle.&nbsp; (It&#039;s always about business, never about dogs!).&nbsp; And there we have a videotape, from YouTube - - CBW&#039;s *advertisement*!&nbsp; As such, the *BEST* view of their business that they have to offer!&nbsp; Take a look at that, and I&#039;ll be back soon with my assessment of that video, and the final chapter (and it isn&#039;t good news). <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

I have offered the *good* news - - that a kennel is not your *only* option for boarding your pet.&nbsp; I have offered *good* and valid information.&nbsp; I have extended a *good* option to you and given you a *good* lead on services that exist (and, in fact, could direct you to a far, far better and more exclusive *kenneling* situation, if your dog would not be suitable for home-boarding, than the *commercial* one you are using).<br /><br />Thus far, I have gotten *three* *NEGATIVE* responses&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; NO positive response, no neutral response (say, a question or two, perhaps). - - but three negative responses.<br /><br />*NOTICE* - - that nothing that I wrote would, rationally, elicit such a negative response (but from, perhaps, a kennel owner), and it would seem contrary to logic, to respond in such a hostile, adversarial, and negative manner, to a *gift*.<br /><br />The lack of receptiveness to this, and to the entire prospect of gaining new knowledge, is striking.&nbsp; The three people who have responded (negatively) do not want to know more, they are apparently satisfied with what has been convenient for them, and they seem very threatened, in fact, by the prospect of something that challenges their preconceived notions, most particularly, it would seem, the one concerning whether or not they have, up to this point, been doing the *best* they could do with the arrangements they have made for their companion animals.<br /><br />One person has accused me of being &quot;condescending&quot; because I have provided information.&nbsp; She asserts that I have *assumed* that she is ignorant, uninformed, and incompetent - - yet, inherent and intrinsic to the very conversation that we are having - - about *kennel* boarding - - she *proves* that this is so.&nbsp; Otherwise, she would know, as my clients do, about in-home boarding, she would be boarding her dog with a competent home-board and not a kennel, and we wouldn&#039;t be having this conversation!<br /><br />She clearly has *not* done &quot;the best&quot; in researching her options, she has *not* done her &quot;homework&quot;, she does not like having this revealed to her, and considers the information I have provided a personal affront to her dignity (the hell with what&#039;s best for the dog, at this point!).<br /><br />This does not, however, discredit the information, nor should it disuade those inclined to take a more pro-active and successful approach to the introduction of new and better resources, from availing themselves of accomodations that might better facilitate their purposes (such as the gentleman who was concerned with doing business with someone who could be relied on in emergencies).&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s fun to talk down to someone who knows more than you do, from the safe anonymous concealment of the internet - - but this is not productive; it will not be of any assistance to anyone, or their dogs.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, am *not* anonymous.&nbsp; I have put myself out here, and stand by the information I have given you, *by name*, and with traceable references.&nbsp; My qualifications, going back over thirty years, attest to my expertise in my field.&nbsp; It is then *curious* that anyone with less qualification would attempt to do anything but *learn*, and utilize that information that they have gotten from me to increase the efficiency of their performance, but would prefer, instead, to take meaningless pot-shots at me, by way of justifying their choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Oh - - you say you&#039;re doing everything *perfectly*, with *no* room for improvement?&nbsp; Gee - - wish I were *you*!).<br /><br /><strong>Before you reject something good that&#039;s offered to you, such as the information I am giving you - - ask yourself *WHY* you&#039;re doing that</strong>.&nbsp; (Just a little *behavioral* thing - - but as a behaviorist, I think we should all be more *aware* of our motivations).<br /><br />Here is one of the reasons why I prefer spending my time with dogs!&nbsp; They make more sense than many people do, and don&#039;t usually fight you when you&#039;re offering something nice.<br /><br />As long as Buddy (I believe it was) has quoted *Shakespeare*, perhaps I should cite a far more pertinent quotation, from the Bible; Matthew: 7:6<br /><br />&#039;Do not throw bread to dogs, or pearls to swine&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Stay tuned for Part 2.<br /><br />[/i]

I know exactly what I need with regard to dog care and they satisfy those needs. The web cam provides much more than fun entertainment. It provides an inside look at what your dog is doing as well as what care and supervision is being provided. We used this feature to evaluate the suitability of Camp Bow Wow for Blackjack&#039;s needs before we ever went through their doors. Naturally, we also use it when he is in their care. What we invariably see is staff either in the play areas with the dogs or immediately outside the play areas. We have seen them intervene when they judge that play may be becoming too rough and we have seen them also provide frequent hands-on affection to the dogs in their care. A web cam is the best alternative to actually being on the premises and watching your dog play in person. <br /><br />Blackjack himself provides evidence of how well Camp Bow Wow is satisfying his needs. Although he normally walks nicely at heel &amp; sits waiting to be invited before passing through doorways, he pulls at the leash as we approach their facility. As we said earlier, he loves it!<br /><br />I feel that the subject of inoculations is a bit off topic and would have been better addressed in a separate thread where opposition to inoculation might not be seen as self-promotional. Nevertheless, since it has been brought up here, I feel compelled to respond. As someone who lost a puppy in the past to distemper (he was infected before receiving the vaccine), spends a considerable amount of time in the woods upstate (i.e., possible rabies exposure), and who allows my dog frequent access to other canines, his health and well being is of primary concern. Both the North Shore Animal League &amp; our private vet recommend inoculations, including semiannual bordatella. However, since the recent posts did cause me concern, I asked a friend who is a vet in New Hampshire to comment. The following is his response:<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><em>Hi, Brian,<br /><br />I&#039;m glad that Camp Bow Wow is working out so well for you and Blackjack.&nbsp; I hope that it continues to serve your needs.&nbsp; For a variety of reasons, however, it may not serve the needs of other dogs or satisfy the requirements of every dog-person, and options are always nice.<br /><br />What I can offer, by way of response to your assessment of the overall quality of what this venue provides, is to tell you that you, as a kennel customer, present your (limited) experience, whereas I, as a dog-care professional, with extensive experience, going back decades, present the benefit of cumulative information, from a vast variety of sources.&nbsp; I will also assert that unless you are a behaviorist, a qualified dog-care provider, or an experienced dog handler, you have no way of recognizing &quot;risky business&quot;, when you observe it.&nbsp; You have also made mention of &quot;intervention&quot;, in situations that were becoming aggressive - - but then what?&nbsp; You have not told us what their solution is, in this situation.<br /><br />You have only commented on a single aspect of the Camp Bow Wow offerings, that being the dogs running around a great deal, which seems to please you entirely.&nbsp; But you do not mention many other things that are crucial to proper dog care.&nbsp; Since we are talking so much about how much the dogs *run around* - - WHAT - - for example - - ARE THEIR PROTOCOLS AROUND THE ISSUE OF *BLOAT*?&nbsp; <br /><br />Do you know anything *about* bloat, and how common it is in connection with *kennels*?&nbsp; Do you know how important cleanliness of feed and water pans is?&nbsp; How and when, what temperature, and what amount, of *water* is given to a dog that&#039;s been exercised that way?&nbsp; When, relative to such exercise, dogs may be *fed*, without incurring risk?&nbsp; What are the feeding protocols?&nbsp; What are the sleeping arrangements / supervision?&nbsp; What do the dogs do when they&#039;re *not* running around, and how and where and in what way do they do it?<br /><br />You come forth with your one instance, regarding your, individual, dog.&nbsp; I bring the knowledge accrued by association with *thousands* of dogs and case histories.&nbsp; How do you compare that?&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a *neighborhood*-oriented website, but have this discussion on a *dog*-oriented site, and at the mention of &quot;kennels&quot;, &quot;bloat&quot;, or &quot;innoculations&quot;, the tragic horror stories would begin to *pour* in!&nbsp; I hear them all the time, because ot the business I&#039;m in.<br /><br />As I have caused you sufficient concern for you to have inquired with your vet, I feel that I owe you address of both your reply to what I wrote, and to your vet&#039;s response.<br /><br />And oh, my!&nbsp; First I must comment on something (else) that you might think should be in another thread - - but it is just a quickie response:&nbsp; the North Shore Animal League IS BY NO MEANS AN AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE ON *ANYTHING*!&nbsp; The North Shore Animal League is a *tax shelter* for the Lewett family, that owns part of the town of Port Washington, and among those who have done rescue (as I have, for over forty years) well-known to be outright charlatans, with a disgraceful record.&nbsp; The A.S.P.C.A., when under contract to the city, had a dossier on them as long as your arm (even though they then, incongrously, out of desperation, released purebreed animals to them - - and that is *another* story!).&nbsp; My personal experience with North Shore was that when they irresponsibly handed out animals to anyone at all who would take one, at one of their &#039;free-dinner-free-watch-free-tank-of-gas&#039; promotional come-ons, and those animals were then *dumped*, still wearing their North Shore tags, and North Shore was contacted, in regard to the return of these animals&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; *they patently refused to take them back*!<br /><br />That being said, I see that your veterinarian friend has attempted to discredit me &quot;a bit&quot;, but has, essentially, done a lot of hedging and double-talk, including condoning a harmful procedure, because it is &quot;common practice&quot;, yet has revealed a half-way admission of the veracity of what I have told you.<br /><br />As for the veterinary take on this subject, I see that this vet (whom, for the sake of clarity, I shall refer to as &quot;he&quot;, though it may very well be a woman; if so, my apologies) has been quite prudent and careful in rendering his response to your inquiry, and has misinformed more by condescention, casting of aspersion, and gross omission, than by flagrant untruth (although there is some of that, as well, particularly as regards Bordatella vaccine).&nbsp; This practitioner straddles the fence on the truth pertaining to the issue of vaccines, and suggests that I am an &quot;extremist&quot; (which I am *not*; I did not say that I object to innoculations; I object, with *&quot;scientific&quot;* reason, to *repeated*, *unnecessary* vaccines on an animal already with immunity; I object to *improperly administered* vaccines, and improper administration schedules that harm animals) to distract from the fact that he subtly and grudgingly *agrees*, to some extent, with what I have told you, to the degree that he will render an admission.&nbsp; It is a very non-definitive statement.&nbsp; I will not make the same.&nbsp; I will make definitice statements about those things that I know definately.<br /><br />Veterinarians make 24% of their yearly income on unnecessary innoculations, and who knows how much more as a result of the illnesses they cause.&nbsp; I do not.&nbsp; My business caters to the well-being of animals; it relies on *well* animals, not sick ones.&nbsp; Therefore, I have no vested interest in promoting harmful innoculations.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are also highly respected *homeopathic* veterinarians , surely also &quot;scientists&quot; - - an entire cadre of them, from Martin Goldstein on - - who would oppose such casual regard to the consequences of yearly, unnecessary, incorrectly- administered innoculations, and who would cite *comparative* analysis, of the number of animals that die of a disease, against the number who die as a result of the vaccinations for that disease.&nbsp; Surely your vet does not mean to discredit *those* *scientists* (Goldstein is a microbiologist).<br /><br />Here&#039;s a little SCIENCE lesson for you (run this by your vet):&nbsp; YOUR DOG CAN ONLY BE 100% IMMUNE TO SOMETHING.&nbsp; HE CANNOT BE ANY MORE THAN 100% IMMUNE TO ANYTHING.&nbsp; THERE IS *NO MORE* THAN *100%* IMMUNITY.&nbsp; *100%* IS *AS* *IMMUNE* AS YOU CAN BE.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said that four different ways, just to make sure you really *get* this.<br /><br />Now - - *that being the case* - - when your dog is 100% immune to something&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; *why* is your vet calling you in for a yearly innoculation for that?<br /><br />If your vet is your dog&#039;s health-care advocate, even if you beat his door down, *asking* for more shots - - *why* would he agree to administer them to an animal he *knows* has *100%* immunity to that disease, *particularly* when he *knows* that by doing so he hazards permanently damaging or destroying your animal&#039;s health?&nbsp; (And then charging you for that!)&nbsp; And *why* is your kennel participating in this unconscionable scam, that puts your dog at risk?&nbsp; (The reason is *self-interest* via *no* legal liability, based on *outdated* standards).&nbsp; Moreover, why would this vet allow a *kennel* to dictate health-care protocols to *him*, when *he* is a *veterinarian*<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" /><br /><br />If your dog has had the standard vaccination series, even once, let alone twice and three times, or more - - HE IS *100% IMMUNE* TO THOSE DISEASES, and all you need to prove it is a yearly *BLOOD TITER* READING.&nbsp; Let any veterinarian contest this!<br /><br />As for Bordatella vaccine - - there most definitely *has* been a link found between intranasal application and the instance of lymphosarcoma, starting in the gland mass beneath the jaw, in even very young dogs, *not* &quot;genetically predisposed&quot;, and *why* is this vet vaccinating *&quot;yearly&quot;* for it when he has admitted that the vaccine onlly imparts a 6-month (alleged) &quot;immunity&quot;?&nbsp; Why vaccinate for it at *all*, then???&nbsp; Cha-ching, cha-ching!&nbsp; (That&#039;s the cash register you hear, folks!&nbsp; This is how vets are *trained* - - not only to practice medicine, but to do so in such a way as insures a thriving *business*).<br /><br />Regarding leptospirosis, the classic form of the disease does not require yearly re-administration.&nbsp; The *new* form of the disease, that emerged a few years ago, is something I alerted my clients to, and recommended innoculation for, with extreme care taken in proper administration, that being *no other vaccines given for at least ten days, if not two weeks, before or after that vaccine*.&nbsp; <br /><br />Considering the fact that one of the aspects of my profession is to stand in judgement of veterinary management, I am not surprised at all by the tone of this response.&nbsp; But I have been doing what I do for many years.&nbsp; I wonder how, relatively, experienced your vet friend is.&nbsp; &quot;Shit happens&quot; is a very poor disgnostic response from a medical practitioner.&nbsp; I do not pay my medical practitioners to tell me that &quot;shit happens&quot;.&nbsp; It most certainly *does*, particularly in the event of gross mismanagement of care.&nbsp; Then shit *really* happens.<br /><br />I am *not* a veterinarian.&nbsp; I do *not* have to lie to protect or justify the protocols of the veterinary profession.&nbsp; I have no interest in pushing unnecessary, injurious, costly veterinary procedures, and I have not been trained to include harmful practices to ensure vigorous business.<br /><br />Perhaps this veterinarian has missed the fact that I am an animal behaviorist, when he refers to &quot;scientists&quot; versus &quot;a member of a conspiracy&quot;; surely a veterinarian would understand that my branch of *science* requires a through knowledge and understanding of *all* matters pertaining to the animal, *starting*, first and foremost, with the *health* and *nutrition* of the animal, and issues thereof.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is not a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to be up-to-date in clinical knowledge, in the best interests of the subject of that knowledge, for which one advocates, and to educate the relevant public, in regard to these matters.&nbsp; Accusers of &quot;conspiracy&quot; assume an adversarial position to challenge, frequently because they have something to conceal.&nbsp; Abuse, and generation of business by unnecessary innoculation, is the veterinary industry&#039;s dirtiest little secret.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take my word for it; check out the subject yourself, in something of substance, for the layman, like the Whole Dog Journal, a highly competent and significantly respected publication, that would be difficult to discredit as being &quot;conspiracy propaganda&quot;.<br /><br />But, whatever you do - - remember the vital questions: &quot;IF MY DOG IS 100% IMMUNE TO THESE DISEASES, *WHY* DO YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM MORE SHOTS?&quot;&nbsp; And, &quot;IF YOU GIVE HIM MORE SHOTS, HOW MUCH *MORE* IMMUNE WILL HE *BE* THAN 100%?&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; And ask them of your vet, next time yearly innoculation time rolls around.&nbsp; <br /><br />THEN - - *ASK FOR A *BLOOD TITER* PANEL, INSTEAD - - and you will see, by the antibody readings, that your animal needs NO MORE SHOTS, and nothing more than that yearly blood titer to prove immunity.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for dog care facilities - - anyone who is worthy of your trust should be sufficiently concerned about the animals they care for, to be knowledgeable, and *currently* informed.&nbsp; That means that they should be asking for nothing more than a BLOOD TITER panel, for dogs that have already been immunized.<br /><br />People should not be compelled to put their dogs at serious and unnecessary risk in order to board them; it&#039;s that simple.&nbsp; It is unnecessary, it is irresponsible, and it is not in the best interests of the clients (or, customers, in the case of a kennel, as opposed to a service business), canine or human.<br /><br />Finally, regarding the assertion of &quot;self-promotion&quot;, I most certainly *do* promote myself!&nbsp; I am one of the most competent, qualified people in my field of endeavor, and I see no reason to be coy about this, or to be shy about offering my services.&nbsp; I know what I offer clients, and, most importantly, as this is my primary interest, their dogs.&nbsp; I am *not* in competition with boarding kennels.&nbsp; I run a *service* business, with which boarding kennels cannot in any way compare.&nbsp; Boarding kennels are commercial operations; they have *customers*; my business serves *clients*.&nbsp; There is a great difference.<br /><br />I want people to know the options that exist for them, and how to make informed decisions.<br /><br />Given the many years that I have devoted to the well-being and humane treatment of animals, and the caliber of the business that I run, those who know me understand very well why I am self-confident, and always, first and foremost, acting in the best interests of those animals I serve, that being the mission statement of my practice.&nbsp; I run a full-service business, where I *teach* my clients how to read a dog food label, what to expect by way of vet care, how to ascertain the quality of those businesses and practices that serve them and their dogs.<br /><br />As for *any*thing &quot;spreading like wildfire&quot;, this has never occured in (either my erstwhile rescue facility or in ) my home, in the many years that I have cared for animals - - and that is not a matter of lucky happenstance, but of expertise, conscientious attention and effort, and immaculate protocols.<br /><br />The only &quot;agenda&quot; I have, to &quot;push&quot; is the well-being of creatures who cannot speak for themselves, that they not be exploited in cruel ways, for convenience or the sake of someone&#039;s pocketbook.&nbsp; I don&#039;t need to make animals *sick* to make my living; I make a decent living *advocating* for them.<br /><br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; If anyone wishes to cast aspersions on my credibility?&nbsp; First - - find something I&#039;m *wrong* about!&nbsp; &nbsp; </em>
