				Sadly, Coral Aquarium Pet Supplies will be closing their doors on August 31st.&nbsp; They have been in business at that location for over 50 years.&nbsp; They have a lot of inventory to sell before then.&nbsp; Many items are on special.&nbsp; They also have a large selection of frozen and refrigerated pet foods, some of which cannot be found in the chain stores or ordered online.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coral Aquarium<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7505 Roosevelt Avenue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 718.429.3934<br />Mon-Fri. 10-8<br />Sat&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10-7<br />Sun&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noon-6<br /><br />Thanks<br />

				oh no!<br /><br />that&#039;s the only pet store i&#039;ve ever patronized in Jackson Heights. for cats we had ages ago, and for the rabbit we have now. the owners are so lovely and knowledgeable, so willing to help.<br /><br />i&#039;ll have to get there in the next week to stock up on non perishables and send regards.

				This is sad. I have to admit, I kept thinking how amazing it was that they were still hanging on. Nothing against them, it&#039;s just that so many independent businesses are closing.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop in and buy a few things.

				This is terrible news. It was a huge space though. Hopefully someone can fill the void of a small business pet food store. Lugging 10 lbs of specialty cat food from Manhattan is going to be a pain.

				According to Jackson Heights Post, the owner is citing the Clear Curbs initiative as playing a role in their closing. <br />I’ll be sad to see this store go - they had a lot of interesting brands of specialty wet cat food that PetCo, etc. don’t seem to carry. I often stop there on the way home. I’ll admit, we don’t buy our 20 lb bags of vat litter and food there because it’s a pain to lug home. But since I have a car, I’d buy those things at Target, PetCo, etc. where the prices are substantially better. Hopefully we can get another pet food store.&nbsp; <br /><br />https://jacksonheightspost.com/jackson-heights-pet-store-closing-after-48-years

				I had hoped they could negotiate with the landlord to go back to the original store size but I don&#039;t think that is happening.<br />I buy raw cat food made by small companies that do not sell to Petco etc.&nbsp; <br />It is truly a shame that small businesses are a being phased out.

				stopped in for a farewell visit today. the owners were nice as ever, but mostly blamed rising rents. 20K per month for that space. and they didn&#039;t sound eager to downsize to their old space, which would be more than half that for less than half the space.

				This is a major bummer. I started shopping here nearly 30 years ago. It has been a luxury to be able to buy all my pet supplies, including assorted high quality food, of all things, right here in the neighborhood.<br /><br />It would be one thing if the owners were retiring, but as it&#039;s yet another business forced out by crazy-high rent that makes it especially frustrating and sad.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m so sorry for them and have stopped in almost every day since I heard the news, yet I still can&#039;t believe it&#039;s happening!&nbsp; :&#039;( <br />

				One comment: when I moved here seven years ago, I went in and asked if they could make regular deliveries of&nbsp; cat food and litter. They said no, they do not deliver. So I ordered from Chewy.com. Why should I have to shlep heavy boxes of cat food and litter on a regular basis when I can have them delivered by Chewy or Amazon or any number of other companies? This may have been one factor that led to their demise.

				They probably&nbsp; also lost some business to the PetCo (or PetSmart, can&#039;t tell them apart) that opened a few years ago...<br /><br />And I see tons of boxes from Chewy in the guard booth where our packages get delivered.

				Yes virtually everyone I know who has a cat (or dog I guess) orders from Chewy. They got into the market early, I guess, and scooped up all the business. <br /><br />They also have good customer service--when I decided I had to switch litter brands and I&#039;d already stockpiled a bunch of it I bought from them, I called to ask if they would take the unopened litter back and they said no, just donate it someplace, and we will refund your money.<br /><br />They promptly replace anything that gets damaged in transit, etc. Cat food and litter are both really heavy to transport, so I would only buy from someplace that delivers. And some pet stores do--just not that one. <br /><br />Anyway, I also have started to patronize Petco in the mall near La Cannelle--big, clean store, huge selection, discount programs, they do grooming have adoption services, and they have great customer service, too. I go there when I can&#039;t wait for a delivery from Chewy, though I am on their autoship program, but sometimes I need something fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				A plug for Whiskers in Astoria - they do free deliveries to JH. They carry the raw cat food that I used to get from Coral and that is not available at Petco or from Chewy (which I know other ppl in JH buy because Coral used to run out of it when we went to buy!). They have a frequent buyers program too.
