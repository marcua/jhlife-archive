				I find it a little unnerving that people can say that because one is not gay, they should not be offended by a candidate&#039;s negative comments against the gay community.<br /><br />Substitute any of the adjectives below for gay in my above sentence, and see if you share that view ...<br /><br />Italian<br />African American<br />eldery<br />Martian<br />handicapped<br />immigrant<br />Irish<br />Asian<br />Haitian<br />veteran<br /><br />Discrimination is just that, no matter the group.
