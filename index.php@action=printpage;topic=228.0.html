				Wed. night.&nbsp; Dinner for my Mom&#039;s b-day.<br />need a place not too far a walk from 76 &amp; 34th.<br />Our stalwart is Spicy Mina, but looking for something new. <br />Tried Armondo&#039;s and the Argentinian BBQ next door.<br />Looking for nice atmosphere, convivial and of course good food.<br />We could travel, but it would be nice to do something local.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

				A few people including me recommended La Fusta on another thread, but that might be too far a walk for you. (across Roosevelt Ave on 82nd St.)&nbsp; There was another steakhouse recommended on that thread as well.<br /><br />Also try chowhound for &#039;fancy and romantic&#039; in Jackson Heights here http://www.chowhound.com/topics/327162<br /><br />(I know you&#039;re not looking for romantic with your mom, but sometimes people use the word romantic to describe a place with good ambiance.)<br /><br />Have a nice celebration.

				Maybe take a car service to Pio Pio? It&#039;s got a nice lively atmosphere that&#039;s birthday perfect. And the food is always so tasty.

				It would be either a long walk or a really short subway to the following places, but would be well worth it.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Sapori Dischia 55-15 37th avenue.&nbsp; Great Italian-with lots of atmosphere in a quirky way.&nbsp; A bit on the pricy side, but really good food and wine bar as well as music on the weekends.<br /><br />2. Sripriphai 64-13 39th avenue.-&nbsp; It is considered by many to be the best thai in new york city.&nbsp; If you like Thai, this is a must try.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would recommend the italian, it&#039;s more of a celebration type place.&nbsp;

				Thanks all for the recs.<br /><br />I really want to try La Fusta after reading that thread-I&#039;ll check it out. <br />We have walked to Pio Pio before and enjoyed it very much-that may be the best chicken I&#039;ve had.<br />We do have a vegetarian in the group however, so I have to consider the menu.<br />I haven&#039;t done Shripriphai yet, my brother thinks it somewhat over-rated, but that may work.<br /><br />I like this Sapori Dischia place. Sounds perfect. My parents are both Italophiles.<br />How pricey is it?<br /><br />Thanks again.

				Sapori has an &quot;Opera&quot; night during the week, it may be Wednesdays or Thursdays.&nbsp; It can be loads of fun!

				I highly recommend La Fusta.&nbsp; The prices are great for the quality and amount of food you get and the ambiance is very nice and intimate.&nbsp; I&#039;d go with the half skirt steak if you&#039;re a meat eater.&nbsp; Most people I know, even large men, cannot finish the full skirt steak - it&#039;s massive!!!!&nbsp; Their chimichurri in an incredible mix of garlic, olive oil and herbs.&nbsp; The ribs are also delicious and their tripe soup is a killer.&nbsp; Watercress salads are refreshing and they also have a nice selection of desserts.&nbsp; Their Argentinean malbec selections are also very nice for Elmhurst and reasonably priced.<br /><br />

				Forgot to post a sample menu link for Sapori d&#039;Ischia from New York Magazine.&nbsp; It lists pricing information.&nbsp; Keep in mind that Sapori is notorious for charging for bottled water, and they&#039;ve been known to bring it to your table even if you haven&#039;t ordered it!<br /><br />http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/sapori-dischia/menus/dinner.html

				One advice on Sapori d&#039;Ischia.&nbsp; They will charge you for bottled water, as will any other restaurants, but they will refuse to serve tap water when requested.<br /><br />Some people find this offensive, some don&#039;t.&nbsp; It&#039;s just a heads up.

				I think the water thing is a bit obnoxious but it won&#039;t stop me from going back for the right occasion.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only been once and thought it was great. Also, if you just stick to the Proseco (a sparkling Italian wine) who cares about water?

				Yes they do not offer tap water but you do not have to buy bottled water which I beleive is not pricey there-I never do.&nbsp; Also they do not have butter or ice (although you can bring in your own ice if you have to have it)&nbsp; If you can overlook these things, then the place is very good.&nbsp; Better than anything around unless you go to manducatis in LIC which is a bit farther away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am not 100 % sure, but I think the appetizers can run you up to 15 dollars and entres up to mid 30&#039;s.&nbsp; It is a more expensive meal say then ethnic restaurants in the area, but it is worth it if you can afford it.&nbsp; I have been a three times on Saturday and they have a singer after about 8.&nbsp; It is fun.&nbsp; I also took my parents and they liked it.&nbsp; It is a nice gift.&nbsp;

				Right, sorry, should have replied.<br /><br />We opted (the 5 of us) for La Fusta.<br />I really wanted to like the place but I wasn&#039;t blown away. <br />3 of us had the skirt steak, which was a nice piece of meat, very tender and tasty, but so so oily. <br />We tried the watercress salad per so many recs, but we found it too sodden with dressing.<br />One person had salmon cannelloni but found it bland, which I did too.<br />I was the only person brave enough to try the black sausage, which I thought had a nice flavor.<br /><br />Service was ok, but they had a huge table next to us (30+) so I understand why.<br />I liked the atmosphere.<br />The man who seems to run the place could not have been more pleasant.<br />I was so exited to go but left underwhelmed. I will try it again though.<br /><br />My father made some quip regarding the Italian influence on Argentine cuisine, stating something to the effect that the Argentines didn&#039;t learn perhaps as much as they should from Italian cooking. He did enjoy himself very much there though.<br /><br />thanks for all the help

				I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t enjoy your meal at La Fusta.&nbsp; When you say the meat was so so oily, was it greasier than other skirt steaks or other steaks (sirloin, filet, etc.) in general?&nbsp; Skirt steaks naturally have a very high fat content which gives it the flavor and &quot;greasiness&quot;.&nbsp; If it weren&#039;t for the fat, the meat would be way too chewy for humans.<br /><br />I always order the salad with the dressing on the side so that I can control its portion.<br /><br />The Argentinean cuisine is definitely strongly influenced by the Italians, as well as the Spanish, other Europeans, and native Indians.&nbsp; They may not be as good in terms of pasta, wine and cheese, but they&#039;ve one-upped the Italians in terms of steaks and meat.

				Yes, I&#039;ve eaten skirt steak before and it is noticeably greasier than other cuts, but this seemed more so. Now maybe I&#039;m being unfair and don&#039;t know enough about this cut of meat to pass fair judgement. Often when I eat skirt steak it is thinly sliced and so may not seem as greasy or oily than when in a large portion like La Fusta&#039;s.<br />I did eat every bite of my steak however, as did the other 2 skirt steak eaters.<br /><br />I&#039;ll definitely go back, the reviews are so consistently positive about the place and that menu is so extensive it is worth more attention. Even my very favorite restaurants will leave me less than inspired time and again.

				It may have been an off day.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had their skirt steak more than 10 times and 9 out of 10 have been great.
