				I&#039;ve been on Spectrum for a few years now and have only ever had basic internet service. I repeat basic. I am not a gamer at all, occasionally stream a movie, and do some light coding.&nbsp; <br /><br />I believe at one point I was paying $29.99, maybe 8 years ago. It then increased to $39.99. Then $49.99. At one point I asked why is the price increasing. They said something about improvements to their system and premium high-speed internet. I reminded them that I only have basic internet. They said that that was the premium service. ?! (call comparatively basic bandwidth premium and then charge for the designation?)<br /><br />This month&#039;s bill is now $59.99. I call to ask why the increase. They tell me that I have been on a $20 promotional introductory plan. I tell them I&#039;ve been on spectrum for years and if it was &quot;promotional&quot; wouldn&#039;t I now be paying $69.99.<br /><br />She spends 20 minutes &quot;talking to a manager&quot; and then tells me i have been a client since 2012, but that some glitch in the system allowed me to keep the $20 discount for this long. And then she tells me that i still have a $10 discount, but her system can only predict my billing statements through July. So basically I have $69.99/month to look forward to for basic internet service come August. <br /><br />Anybody else have an experience like this or can shed any light on this?

				I&#039;m on spectrum too. Just internet, 100MBit/s down 10Mbit/s up is $79.99 all inclusive. <br /><br />It went up 10 bucks a couple of years ago, but since 2014, it was this price.<br /><br />10 bucks cheaper for &quot;basic&quot; sounds like their advertised price....sorry, it&#039;s the going rate in NYC. <br /><br />

				Can you switch? Price shopping always works for me. But I am lucky and have FIOS, Spectrum and RCN available in our building.

				You probably had Time Warner Cable. When Spectrum took over they gave a lot of people a new cable modem and didn&#039;t charge them for it. Accepting the free modem means that you no longer have Time Warner internet, but have Spectrum internet, which is why they call it an introductory offer. A summer intern in one of the stores advised me to keep the Time Warner internet because the Spectrum was going to go up in price. My internet is 50 Mbps rather than 100, but that&#039;s fast enough for 4k Netflix and my price hasn&#039;t gone up yet. At least so far.<br />Next year home 5G service should be available so the ISP game is about to have real competition.

It&#039;s criminal the price we pay for basic internet. See if FIOS or RCN is an option in your building. Otherwise, I used https://www.asktrim.com/ (https://www.asktrim.com/), which somehow negotiates a bill reduction. They do charge for the service, which is a portion of their yearly savings, but you still end up ahead in the end.

				Same here, my bill went from $49 to $59 for the same basic 50MB service. They are actually claiming that I&#039;m getting $10 discount given that the &quot;official&quot; price for this service tier is $70! Of course they suggested to increase my speed as a &quot;special&quot; offer...and we all know that in 6 - 12 months the special offer will expire and we are back from where we started.<br /><br />Seems Verizon is still not available JH (or at least on my street) any suggestion how to push them to finally provide service? (not that they are much better, but at least have some leverage for negotiation with Spectrum)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				You should be able to buy your own modem and not pay a monthly fee for one.&nbsp; I did that back when the service was provided by TWC.&nbsp; Be sure to check that 1.it&#039;s supported and 2.that it&#039;s rated for whatever bandwidth you&#039;re paying for (and ideally faster so you don&#039;t have to get a new modem if you decide to upgrade).

				Having Time Warner doesn&#039;t exempt you from the price increase, as my own bill went up on today&#039;s statement to $59.99. Time to figure out if FIOS fees and taxes add up to any real savings when added to their promotional price.

				<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=19756.msg98148.html#msg98148">Quote from: sl on March 19, 2020, 09:59:56 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Maybe it’s just inflation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s important to point out that this is not at all an inflation driven process. If anything, the prices should be going down, just like the price of any other technology product has moved down in the last decade. For example, I remember paying as much as $2/min calling to Europe - now I pay 1 to 10 cents a min (no special plan required)! <br /><br />This is very much a company driven effort to increase revenues by moving existing TW customers to Spectrum branded plans that in many cases cost significantly more: https://www.syracuse.com/news/2017/05/thousands_of_time_warner_cable_video_customers_flee_spectrums_higher_prices.html (https://www.syracuse.com/news/2017/05/thousands_of_time_warner_cable_video_customers_flee_spectrums_higher_prices.html)<br />&nbsp;<br />For the last 4 years I&#039;ve been pushing back on the various attempts from Spectrum to increase my plan. At this point however, Spectrum is no longer willing to do so and has outright refused to extend my &quot;grandfathered&quot; plan any more. Why now? Because at this point they have managed to force a critical mass of TW customers to Spectrum branded plans and are no longer afraid of losing too many customers: https://www.syracuse.com/business/2020/04/spectrum-raising-prices-for-legacy-time-warner-cable-plans.html (https://www.syracuse.com/business/2020/04/spectrum-raising-prices-for-legacy-time-warner-cable-plans.html)<br /><br />Again, this is entirely profit driven and has nothing to do with inflation, equipment costs, and so on. The &quot;grandfathered&quot; plans are nothing more than a business gimmick trying to mask price hikes. Otherwise, they will be a subject of FCC oversight as they cant just charge significantly more (20%, 30%) for the same exact service.<br /><br />Ultimately, the root problem in this case is that Spectrum is the only broadband provider on my street. Verizon is nearby, but not yet available for me. As part of the NYC effort to break the ISP monopoly, Verizon was contractually required to provide coverage in the entire city, but failed to do so: &nbsp;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/nyc-blasts-broadband-competition-shortage-as-it-pursues-suit-against-verizon (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/nyc-blasts-broadband-competition-shortage-as-it-pursues-suit-against-verizon).<br /><br />Cheers!<br />
