					Many of you that live in the low 70s may have noticed the neon green signs notifying residents of a film shoot on Friday morning that would prohibit parking on 73 St. from 35 Ave. down past 37 Ave. beginning Thursday night. Just wanted to let you know that the City Office of Film will not allow towing as part of these permits due to the snow situation, and I was told that the signs should be coming down today or tomorrow. I called and spoke with them this afternoon. If you care to re-confirm, their contact info can be found at the link below, but my understanding is that you will not have to move your car for this film shoot. <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/contact/contact.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/film/html/contact/contact.shtml</a>

					Another vote for Astor Room, although I understand that they are closed temporarily for a remodel and will re-open on Friday with a new menu and a grand re-opening event. <br /><br />Another good, less fancy option, particularly if you like craft beer, is Sunswick 35-35. They offer simple bar food, but it&#039;s well done, and the service is always pleasant. They have a sandwich on the menu modeled after the famous Primanti sandwich (it&#039;s a Pittsburgh thing) that is my favorite. And they have about 20 beers on tap, all usually quite good, and many local.

					Lindsey, this article might be of interest to you, and the realtor quoted within might be a good resource:<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/your-money/43-questions-to-ask-before-picking-a-new-town.html?_r=0" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/your-money/43-questions-to-ask-before-picking-a-new-town.html?_r=0</a><br />Perhaps there&#039;s a town within commuting distance of NYC that has most/all of the good JH characteristics you love without the price tag. <br />Good luck!

					With the exception of a long outage (both internet and cable) on the evening of the Bruson Building fire, we haven&#039;t experienced any outages recently. About 15 months ago we were experiencing them regularly (internet only), and after a little research came to the conclusion that our wireless router needed to be replaced. We got an Apple Airport, and have been smooth sailing (surfing) since.

					In general, a bank won&#039;t consider you for a mortgage with less than 20% down (unless you&#039;re willing to pay for private mortgage insurance, which is not a good road to go down), and most co-ops allow won&#039;t allow more than 80% financing, so what you have in the bank would need to be equal to 20% of the price of the home (+ another 2-3% for closing costs).<br /><br />That said, money in the bank isn&#039;t the only thing considered when banks are evaluating a loan, and there are programs out there for folks with not a lot of $ to put down. If you have a good credit score and little to no debt, you could be an attractive borrower regardless of how much $ is currently in the bank. And given your income situation, you likely qualify for any number of programs that exist for first-time homebuyer assistance. See these links:<br /><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/downpayment.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/downpayment.shtml</a><br /><a href="http://www.nyshcr.org/Topics/Home/Buyers/" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyshcr.org/Topics/Home/Buyers/</a><br />There are additional programs out there if you are a military vet. <br /><br />All that said, NYC co-ops tend to have stricter financial requirements than lenders, so even with assistance you may still have difficulty. You could look at condos, which cost more up front but tend to not scrutinize finances as heavily.<br /><br />Another option is to look for city sponsored affordable condos/homes: <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/lotteries.shtml" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/buyers/lotteries.shtml</a><br />Again, given your situation, you seem to qualify for this program, and if the Mayor&#039;s new housing plan is pushed forward, you could see a LOT of affordable condos popping up around town (perhaps not in JH, but certainly other parts of Queens). So there&#039;s some waiting involved, as well as some luck (if there are more qualified purchasers than units, there is usually a lottery), but something to put on your radar.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a realtor, lender, or government employee with any expert knowledge of any of the above, just someone who, like you, is wanting to purchase a home and see what options are out there. The above is a bit of what I&#039;ve come across in my research so far.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />

					The meeting was very informative, and there was a pretty good turnout. Lots of new info, but really too much to share on this forum. There will be more meetings to follow, so you should keep an eye out and attend the next one if you can. <br /><br />In the meantime, the Tenant&#039;s Association is trying to get organized and put an email list together, so the best way to stay looped in is to join. They were handing out registration forms at the meeting - perhaps there are extras in the Super&#039;s office? If not, I&#039;m sure he could point you in the right direction as to how to register. (The forms do have the organizing members&#039; names on them, but I feel a little odd disclosing names and apartment numbers publicly on the web. Sorry.)

					So glad you enjoyed the suggestion! I have been going here for a couple years... Whenever we have dinner guests, this is my stop for charcuterie, and I&#039;ve yet to be disappointed with anything I&#039;ve tried. The options can be overwhelming, but the guys help guide you through it, and are always willing to answer questions and offer samples of any of their meats, regardless of how crowded the shop is. A true gem of Queens, in my opinion!<br /><br />If you like duck, I HIGHLY recommend the duck prosciutto... It&#039;s quite rich, but soooo good.

					ProdigalSon, I agree on the postings, I don&#039;t think the removal was deliberate. All notices were still up in my building yesterday evening and this morning. <br /><br />Reading through your questions, I think a few are answered in the offering, but I don&#039;t have the book with me, so going from memory and subject to my interpretation and paraphrasing:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">3. Can current tenants get out of their leases and get the insider prices if they want to purchase one of the vacant apartments on conversion? Maybe the tenant wants a better view, a quieter apartment, a bigger apartment, etc.. How about later on as tenants opt to move and more sponsor units go up for sale?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Per the offering, during the 90 day window in which tenants have the right to purchase their apartments, they can make an offer on only their apartment. After the 90 days, current tenants can make an offer on any apartment, but would no longer receive the preferential pricing. Even if the tenant decides they want to purchase their current apartment, once the 90 days is up, so is the price. Not sure if they&#039;d make exceptions, but I thought this part of the book was pretty clear.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">4. House Rules - if the current owners have been letting certain rules slide and not enforcing them (i.e.; cats, carpeting, etc.) since the co-op is technically a new owner, could non-compliance with these house rules be used as a reason not to renew leases? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is a little tricky. It looks like the current managing agency will remain in place well into the process (not sure at what % sold the management/maintenance is handed over to the co-op, but I think it&#039;s much higher than 15%), and the only thing that would subject you to a new set of house rules would be if your unit was purchased; your landlord would then be the individual owner of your apartment, and you&#039;d be subject to that individual&#039;s rules. There are City and State rules governing what the individual owner can do in terms of services and rent hikes, but I don&#039;t think there is anything governing what house rules they can impose/enforce.<br /><br />Now, whether or not the current managing agency will continue to be relaxed in their enforcement is another issue, and one I&#039;m not sure anyone can predict. Of note: Home Depot on Northern is having a tent sale on carpets in the parking lot.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="index.php@topic=11820.msg56327.html#msg56327">Quote from: ProdigalSon on April 25, 2014, 09:25:00 AM</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">6.

					The notices about the meeting were still up in my building this morning when I left. I&#039;ll report back when I get home if they are gone.<br /><br />In my research on co-op conversions, I did learn that upon receiving the &quot;red herring,&quot; tenants typically form a Tenants Association, which thoroughly reviews the document, up to and including hiring attorneys, engineers, etc. to validate the claims made within. So my biggest question for this meeting is... Who&#039;s paying for all that? I mean, attorneys and engineers aren&#039;t cheap, and if they are representing the tenants, it would be a conflict of interest for the Sponsor to pick up the tab, one would think. So there&#039;s that, plus a million other questions that have popped into my head since Monday evening. But I don&#039;t think there has always been a WPTA, to answer your question, ProdigalSon.<br /><br />Anyway, the Sponsor can&#039;t legally prevent us from forming a T.A., and I&#039;m sure they expect it, as it&#039;s all part of the process, so I wouldn&#039;t think the porters were told to remove them. But sometimes I give people too much credit.<br /><br />Re: the basements, a while back my upstairs neighbor who has lived in the building since birth told me that the restricted hours on the basement are for security, and date back to the late 70s/early 80s, when follow-in attacks were rampant in JH. I asked her if they&#039;d ever change it, and she said she hoped not, because it was really bad back then, and there are lots of places to hide down there with all the weird corners and such.

					Does anyone know if the Sponsor/Owner will have representation at the meeting on Monday? I have developed a fairly thorough list of questions, and I&#039;m really hoping this meeting will provide some clarity, though I imagine if it&#039;s a tenants-only meeting, I might leave with more questions than answers.<br /><br />Anyone have any insight into this?

					I believe my upstairs neighbor has never lived anywhere else, although she has switched apartments within the WP once. She knows a ton about the building, and I really can&#039;t wait to run into her and pick her brain about this.<br /><br />I&#039;m very curious to see how this meeting goes on Monday. I think many tenants are going to be upset. And I can&#039;t imagine where they&#039;re going to hold it - what space is big enough?!<br /><br />+2 on the shower problem, although I don&#039;t know if new piping will fix that. I think the temp regulation (or lack thereof) is just the unfortunate result of having a large boiler serving so many users.

					ProdigalSon, my interpretation was same as yours re: 15% of tenants declaring intent to buy for the co-op plan to go into effect. I did some additional research on the NYSAG&#039;s website, and found that vacant apartments with buyers lined up would contribute to this 15%, and that apartments occupied by senior citizens or disabled person(s) would not. So, there are 192 apartments, and 15% would be 27 units. However (and if I&#039;m reading correctly), any apartments in which the legal tenants are elderly or disabled don&#039;t count toward the total, so say there are 32 apartments that fall into that category... Now we&#039;re looking at 15% of 160 units, or 24 units. <br /><br />Also, I think the number of vacancies right now is quite high, and I&#039;m thinking that&#039;s probably deliberate on the part of the Sponsor/Owner so they can get to that 15% more easily, and without the buy-in of current residents.<br /><br />The tenant meeting notice was posted in the elevators and lobbies this morning. It will be Monday at 7pm, somewhere in the building TBD.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think this is a great opportunity to own property in the neighborhood if the majority of the residents are interested and financially capable, but otherwise, it&#039;s a sad loss for the neighborhood. It&#039;s one of the few rental-only buildings in the neighborhood, and it going co-op, combined with the rising housing prices that are well-documented in other threads on this site, are going to further limit options for middle class families. WP has a family-oriented, working-class vibe, and I think that will soon be a thing of the past. I imagine a lot of current residents will end up being displace by this, and that&#039;s a bummer.<br /><br />

					My husband and I just walked down to take a peek at the damage. We were viewing from 37 and 74. Looks like the fire tore through floors 3 &amp; 4 completely, and partially though floor 2; blinds in the windows on floor 2 at the west corner of the building were intact. However, it did appear that the ceiling of the bodega on the corner of 74 had collapsed - probably due to water damage. And there were still 5 ladders blasting water about an hour ago. So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s looking to good for the restaurants on the first floor, sadly. Hopefully they can guy it out and rebuild quickly, but certainly lots of work to be done.

					You might try Muncan for a ham. They&#039;re a European (Romanian, I think) butcher specializing in all types of cured and smoked meats. I&#039;ve never purchased a whole ham from them, but I&#039;ve tried many of their bacons, prosciutti, and salami and all are delish. And they just posted on Facebook about having nice bone-in hams available. They have 2 locations - Astoria (close to the 46 stop on the R) and Ridgewood, I think. Call ahead, they are probably jammed on account of the holiday.

					I haven&#039;t looked into FIOS, but did ask my super about DirecTV last year. He explained that the building was open to it, but in order to get it we&#039;d need to round up 35 units to commit - that&#039;s about 20% of the building&#039;s units. I imagine the building would have a similar policy for FIOS. It makes sense. There&#039;s a certain amount of building infrastructure that would need to be upgraded - cabling to all floors, ports on the roof, and for DirecTV they&#039;d need to install and maintain the dishes as well. Seems like an expensive endeavor if only a handful of people are interested. The super also mentioned that he had tried to drum up interest a few years ago - he had wanted DirecTV to get some soccer channels - and he was only able to get 5 signatures. So we didn&#039;t bother. But I imagine this is a common policy.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is a rental building. I imagine co-ops have a lot more flexibility to bring in new technology if they can get the board to approve and if they&#039;re willing to shell out the $.
