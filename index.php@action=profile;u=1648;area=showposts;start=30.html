					Again, the kitchen renovation is finally upon me, and anyone willing to (with help) walk this down from the fourth floor is welcome to have it.&nbsp; Purchased in 2006.&nbsp; Works fine.&nbsp; Aesthetically, the paint has worn off where hands have touched it (not like the old days with enamel finishes).&nbsp; Top freezer.&nbsp; enclosed back.&nbsp; I think it is about 28&quot; deep and wide, and about 5&#039; tall.<br /><br />Will be available in early September.

					Brace yourself.... in the proposal that went before the LPC on Tuesday, the storefront sign in the rendering says Old Navy. The sign is blank in the version on the store&#039;s window.&nbsp; Given that Gap and Banana Republic are already here, it is a distinct possibility.&nbsp; Or perhaps wishful thinking on behalf of the building owner.

					I believe you mean the mid-block site where Clark&#039;s women&#039;s store had been for decades.&nbsp; The building was sold two years ago for over $14 million.&nbsp; Now that the lease for the awful Beverly shop had ended, the new owner is gutting the building.&nbsp; Their proposed plan for the exterior - removing the 1970s accretions and restoring the façade - will go before the Landmarks Preservation Commission next week.&nbsp; There was, at one time, a buff-colored brick building under the current exterior.&nbsp; They posted a rendering of their proposal in one of the windows, but it depends on what they find under the current façade.<br /><br />Given the cost of the building, gutting it, and restoring the façade, you can expect that the likely tenant or tenants will be well-funded chain stores rather than &quot;mom and pop&quot; shops.

					I walked from 84th to 79th Streets as the parade (it was mostly noise, not much of a parade, since I saw one float followed by many vehicles with speakers blaring) as it was ending.&nbsp; My ears are still ringing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I did meet up with Councilmember Dromm, and also the policewoman in charge of the parade, Ms. Irizarry (I don&#039;t know her title).&nbsp; I could not communicate with our councilmember because of the noise, but I met Ms. Iriziarry after it had passed by.&nbsp; She said, of course, that they had a permit, however, NO ONE (OF COURSE) WAS MEASURING THE DEAFENING DECIBELS OF THIS EVENT.&nbsp; The organization responsible for this event should never be allowed to hold it on 37th Avenue again. Or anywhere for that matter.&nbsp; I explained that the noise disrespected our community (they were &quot;parading&quot; in a residential area) and that her &quot;report&quot; on the parade must include the unnecessary and deafening sound that emanated from the vehicles and speakers that paraded down 37th Avenue.&nbsp; Where in New York City would something like this be acceptable? <br /><br />If you feel likewise, you need to contact:<br /><br />1. 115th Precinct Community Affairs:&nbsp; 718 533 2010<br />2. Your councilmember&#039;s office:&nbsp; &nbsp;Dromm: 718 803 6373&nbsp; <a href="mailto:ddromm@nyc.council.gov" class="bbc_email">ddromm@nyc.council.gov</a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ferraras-Copeland: 718 651 1917&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="mailto:CD21invites@council.nyc.gov" class="bbc_email">CD21invites@council.nyc.gov</a><br />3. Community Board #3: 718 458 2707&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="mailto:communityboard3@nyc.rr.com" class="bbc_email">communityboard3@nyc.rr.com</a><br /><br />The police department ultimately approves every parade permit.&nbsp; Parade organizers that disrespect the communities they march in should not receive a permit the following year.&nbsp; We must make sure that the 115th Precinct and Ms. Irizarry accurately report on today&#039;s parade so it does not receive a permit in 2017.<br /><br />

					This has been a long time in coming, and I hope the effort is successful.&nbsp; Just remember, if these property owners and merchants were law abiding assets to our community, there would not be a need for this.&nbsp; As I have said for many years, &quot;if my grandmother could figure out was is going on, on Roosevelt Avenue, why can&#039;t our police/city agencies/fill in the blank?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />?&quot;&nbsp; And then, of course, why aren&#039;t they doing something about it?<img src="Smileys/default/huh.gif" alt="???" title="Huh" class="smiley" />&nbsp; Thank you Sen.

					Yes, Clark&#039;s - the women&#039;s clothing store whose name still appears in brass letters on the sidewalk - was a Jackson Heights institution for decades.&nbsp; The building was sold for over $14 million in 2014, and the new owners likely waited for the store leases, including Beverly&#039;s, to end.&nbsp; Their proposed renovation - which includes removing all of the ugly 1970-s era accretions installed by Clark&#039;s, can be found in the storefront next to the Beverly Boutique.&nbsp; They are going through the Landmarks process, so it looks like it will return to be a rather simple buff-brick building.&nbsp; It will be a dramatic aesthetic improvement.&nbsp; And here&#039;s hoping to some quality tenants.&nbsp; Given what the owners paid for this building, one can assume it will likely be larger, well-financed chain stores.&nbsp; And while we can bemoan the loss of mom and pop stores, there is certainly room for them along 37th and Roosevelt Avenues.&nbsp;

					Last Sunday was my breaking point.&nbsp; Having diligently written down the days the planes have taken off over us since last October, I decided to write to the Port Authority&#039;s Community Relations person.&nbsp; You may recall we had a local meeting on airplane noise in October 2015, which is where I met him.&nbsp; Below is his response to my email, which follows his....&nbsp; We will see if anything changes.&nbsp; Thought you all should be aware of the PA&#039;s response.<br /><br /><br />Daniel<br /><br />It is good to hear from you.&nbsp; Thank you for contacting me regarding&nbsp; Runway 22 Departures at LGA.&nbsp; &nbsp;With respect to the referenced flight activity over Jackson Heights, please know&nbsp; that LGA Operations works closely with the FAA Tower to minimize utilization of Runway 22 for departures to the extent possible, taking into consideration quality of life concerns of the local community.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; certain wind conditions occasionally necessitate the FAA’s determination to use this Runway for departing flights (even when we are not implementing construction).<br /><br />Last October, I did have the opportunity to brief you and members of the Jackson Heights community on 2 key projects that we were completing in 2015.&nbsp; As advised, both the Federally mandated safety areas and paving and milling of Runway 13-31, were successfully completed in 2015.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, there&nbsp; have been additional closures of Runway 13-31 due to the rehabilitation and construction of the high speed taxiways connected to Runway 13-31. Please note that while construction crews work diligently to complete the taxiway work in a timely manner, weather conditions which dictate the construction schedule, have sometimes been an impediment to this goal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, weather permitting, the completion of the taxiway work is scheduled to be completed by Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Please know that construction work is critical in order for us to meet and surpass all FAA regulations.&nbsp; Although, additional weekend closures will occur down the road, I do not anticipate any further closures of Runway 13-31 for the remainder of the Summer.&nbsp; &nbsp;If this changes, I will alert you.<br /><br />I understand your frustration and encourage you to file noise complaints either via the&nbsp; Port Authority’s toll-free phone&nbsp; number, 1-800-225-1071, or at the following link on our website: <a href="http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/qs114wbt.php" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://www.planenoise.com/panynj/daPRAbr9/qs114wbt.php</a>.<br /><br />Please also feel free to contact me if I may be of any further assistance on this matter.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ian<br /><br />Ian R.
