				I know this is technically East Elmhurst, but I&#039;m just curious.<br /><br />Anyone involved in this?&nbsp; Over the last few months I&#039;ve noticed a fenced in area of one of the Landing Lights parks being used as a dog park, but over the last few <em>weeks</em>, I&#039;ve seen &quot;NO DOGS&quot; signs posted, and last weekend on Saturday the doors to the fenced in area were padlocked shut and there were more &quot;NO DOGS&quot; signs - but the following day the locks and signs were gone and there were dogs/owners inside.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are some flyers around &quot;HELP US SAVE THE 78th STREET DOG PARK&quot; with the aim to formally recognize the space as a park.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a dog, so I have no horse in this race, so to speak.&nbsp; Just wondering what the consensus is, and if there were another dog park available in the nearby neighborhood - how could that be a bad thing? <br /><br />

				I walk my dogs over there but don&#039;t really let them use the &quot;dog park&quot; From My understanding it is informally used as a dog park with no permits. I do see a lot of people bring their dogs there and it is kept clean.&nbsp; There is a mean, vicious older woman that torments her neighbors and anyone who uses the field (even with permission) and has called cops, posted signs etc for many years. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if it was her posting the signs.&nbsp;
