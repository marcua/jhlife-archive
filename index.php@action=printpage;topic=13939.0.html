				Hi everyone, <br />We are considering to buy in Carlton house. The apts are going through renovations. We have family that live in the area so we know how it is...but I would still like feedback from people who live in the building as to how it is as a place to live? We considered many different options and this seems to be the best one as we do not need to be too close to subway...can anyone who lives in the building share their thoughts or offer any advice? We are thinking of buying on first floor. <br />Thank you in advance x

				Bought a 2 bedroom in Carlton House last year and have contributed to the building&#039;s recent baby boom.&nbsp; We spent a bit more than we had initially planned but have been very happy and my husband is now fond of saying that he would have happily paid even more had he known just how much we would like it here.&nbsp; Incredible neighbors and fabulous, unionized workers.&nbsp; So while maintenance may seem high, I think we&#039;re getting our money&#039;s worth.

				We don&#039;t have a baby room - I think she said we are having a baby boom. Lots of newborns this year.<br /><br />We love living here. The building is well kept. The doormen and porters are great. We got parking a few months after we moved in. That in itself was a life changer.<br /><br />What I really love? The layouts of the apartments are spacious and get great light. And it&#039;s quiet - the walls are very solid. I never hear any of my neighbors.

				Glad to hear. We&#039;re currently in contract and hope to close in mid-Dec. Very excited about calling Carlton House home. <br /><br />Is there a wait for a parking spot?

				Thanks Fw1986. Yeah, we were told the same about parking. Pretty much just sign up when you move in - hope it&#039;s pretty straight forward. <br /><br />Hope you had a good thanksgiving as well and good luck with the move. I hear someone in the building runs a resident website so will be good to eventually meet some of our new neighbors.

				Right after you close, see the super William about parking. <br /><br />The way it was explained to me when we moved in two years ago is that there is rarely if ever a wait.<br /><br />There are more spaces than shareholders who need them. Extra spots are rented to non-owners on a month to month basis, and they will terminate one of those leases if they need to provide a shareholder a spot.<br />

				I know prices in JH and in NYC in general are up.<br /><br />But is it me or is there a sponsor that has done a great job of renovating and marketing units at the Carlton? The prices there seem to have gone up exponentially and the units all seem to have the same renovation job.<br /><br />Just noticed another unit listed with the same reno job. 1st floor 2 bedroom, but the 2nd bedroom is tiny even by NYC standards and has no closet. Asking $429 for what is basically a JR4. Prices seem out of whack in that co-op.

				Thanks Minimal4me. Will talk to William. <br /><br />To be honest, the prices in JH have gone up too fast, but now that I&#039;ve purchased, I need that to continue. My wife and I have been searching and started with LIC and Astoria. Quickly realized we were late to the party and were priced out. I hear Sunnyside is also pretty frothy (at least Astoria and LIC have stuff to do), but I&#039;m not a fan. <br /><br />So the next &quot;neighborhood&quot; place was JH historic district. Stuff is getting snatched up so fast in JH - it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; We were outbid a couple of times. From what I understand Carlton House is a very well run building, good tenants, underground parking, and nicely renovated units. <br /><br />IMO, the only downside of CH is the hike to the train. Fine if you work in midtown, but if you&#039;re down in FiDi, it&#039;s almost an hour door-to-door. Ultimately, CH had all the right stuff and the walk to the train is our tradeoff.

				Anybody know what Carlton House charges to rent parking to an outsider? And who to talk to (phone, email, whatever)? Thanks.

				You definitely make some good points, but something still seems odd to me about the pricing in this building. Generally speaking, the further east you go in JH, the lower prices are. The reality is apartments have been selling at higher prices in CH if you look at the sales records, especially the 1 bedroom and larger units. Most seem to be sponsor units with similar renovations.<br /><br />As far as the studio I mentioned, it appears to have the same floor plan and to be directly above this renovated studio unit which was listed for $249,000 in Feb 2015 and sat on the market for a year. http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3441-85th-St-APT-1D-Jackson-Heights-NY-11372/82791302_zpid/ I&#039;m not sure if it finally sold as it only says &quot;listing removed&quot; on 2/26/16 and I can&#039;t find a record of a sale.<br /><br />This one bedroom at CH was listed around the same time as the studio above for $243,000 and sold for $250,000 in August: http://streeteasy.com/sale/1143489 This wasn&#039;t a sponsor unit and was not renovated, but still looks very nice and only in need of a few cosmetic upgrades. <br /><br />Maintenance seems high in this building as well.
