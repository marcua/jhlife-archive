You may want to contact them to be sure. On Nov. 24 they posted that their heaters were about to arrive in the coming week. They always pay attention to aesthetics and environment, so hopefully you&#039;d find what you&#039;re looking for there.<br /><br />Edited to add that I also saw a post on Nov. 4 where they already had some heaters, so maybe they were awaiting additional heaters on Nov. 24, or maybe I misunderstood. But in any case, they do have some outdoor heating available.<br /><br />(https://i.imgur.com/tgPqhWF.png)<br /><br />

				that looks like a nice setup, but, honestly, i&#039;d shy away from using shared blankets in this environment.

				Bistro Eloise is fully enclosed. I wish they would open up the tent wall facing the building, but they don&#039;t appear to be doing so. As far as I can tell, there is no added ventilation to the tent they&#039;ve set up, which is a requirement when enclosing more than 50% of the outdoor space and setting up partitions inside that space. <br /><br />One of the ways Covid spreads is airborne transmission, so since so many local restaurants are choosing to create environments that encourage that form of spread, which I happen to believe is likely how my loved one who died from Covid encountered the virus, I won&#039;t be dining out.

				that&#039;s disappointing. Bistro Eloise was our only dining-out experience during this period - in early October - and the tent seemed pretty open then, at least facing the building. there were openings on all sides. but that was a relatively warm day, and i haven&#039;t been up that way since. i&#039;m with you as far as holding off on dining out right now. we have a few rough months ahead, and i don&#039;t think a croque madame (even a good one) is worth getting sick for.

				^Yeah, since those folks didn&#039;t get the memo (or use Google), chances are good none of them will be ripping off some of the siding they erected to fully enclose the space. Even the fully enclosed individual pods that have been created seem to lack ventilation. I walk by places like Pollo la brasa Mario (I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve butchered the name) up around 83rd and 37th Ave, which has done&nbsp; an impressive job at created a totally encapsulated space even with individual doors, and I think &quot;who the heck wants to eat in there only a few minutes after some stranger with who knows what Covid status sat in their eating, drinking, laughing, and talking for an hour?&quot; Are people using these spaces? Every time I walk by, they are empty, but I&#039;m not&nbsp; out and about during dinner hours much anymore.<br /><br />But also, how many people are using those spaces now or will use them in the coming weeks?&nbsp; I guess we&#039;ll see.
