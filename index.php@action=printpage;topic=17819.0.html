				I couldn&#039;t find the original thread on this, but the Times now has a story on the high schooler challenging Peralta for his state senate seat: <em><br /><br />In New York City, Mr. Chowdhury plans to challenge an incumbent state senator, Jose Peralta, in a Democratic primary in Queens next fall. In New York State, candidates must be 18 to hold state or local office, and Mr. Chowdhury will turn 18 just in time for the 2018 primary.<br /><br />Mr. Chowdhury comes from a working-class immigrant family in Queens (his father works in a deli and his mother delivers newspapers). He said he became disillusioned with Senator Peralta’s record after learning that he had joined the Independent Democratic Conference.</em><br /><br />https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/nyregion/young-candidates-for-political-office.html<br /><br />

				Chowdhury won&#039;t be the only primary challenger.<br /><br />What&#039;s really important though, is that if you want support a primary challenger in the 2018 Democratic primary and are not currently a registered Democrat, you have exactly two weeks to change your party registration in order to vote in the 2018 primary.<br /><br />CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT (N.Y.

There is an upswell of support in my community to elect a real Democrat that fights for working families and helps call progressive legislation to the floor for a vote.” Asked if de Blasio is encouraging her candidacy, Ramos said, “The Mayor is supportive of a Democratic majority in the state Senate.”</em>

				Some background information on Jessica Ramos from the <strong>Queens Tribune</strong>:<br /><br />Ex-City Hall Aide Mulls Run Against Peralta (http://queenstribune.com/ex-city-hall-aide-mulls-run-peralta/)<br /><br /><em>She admits, “At this point, I’m only considering.” The idea of running had been stewing in her mind for some time, but Ramos knew that if she intended to run, she would have to leave her position at the mayor’s office as the director of Latino Media. On Dec. 1, she did just that.<br /><br />“I’m focusing on having conversations with my neighbors [and] getting a feel for problems across the district,” she said of her potential bid. “A lot of my neighbors feel betrayed. Jose was the second Latino elected official in Queens.”<br /><br />As the daughter of Colombian immigrants, Ramos said that she felt a personal connection to the state senator.<br /><br />“I had looked up to him for a long time,” she said. “His joining the IDC was a real betrayal. I feel duped.”</em>

				&nbsp;Feel strongly that Jessica Ramos should run for Peralta&#039;s seat. She would be an inspired choice for us as a community.<br />She&#039;s a solid neighborhood voice, a Latina, a mother and by living almost in the middle of the neighborhood, she is<br />seeing alot. Also know she has been involved in a number of community service groups here and with the schools.<br />&nbsp;Would vote for her in heartbeat!

				what questions are they asking?<br /><br />He has to canvas to get on the ballot, so I expected canvassing. Maybe that&#039;s what they are doing (staff &amp; volunteers)?<br /><br />Not shocked to hear he didn&#039;t show up to the primary debate. I was surprised to see his name and wondered how they got him to agree to come. Now I&#039;m guessing his name was included because he had been invited. He knows he&#039;ll get hammered by all his challengers on his defection to the IDC and voting for two Republican budgets, so it&#039;s hard to see an upside to his presence at a debate (hosted by the Democratic Club that kicked him out). I guess he found a more productive way to spend his evening.<br /><br />

				^no surprise there. under the deal to unite the Democrats in the NYS Senate, which Crowley (chair of the Queens County party) was a part of, the party agreed it would formally support the IDC members (and if they didn&#039;t rejoin the Democratic caucus, it would support their challengers). <br /><br />Never forget Peralta is the guy who talked about how bad the IDC was right up until he joined them.

				Happy to see Mr. Chowdhury has dropped out of race. He seems like a nice man, but we need a united front against the incumbent Senator. <br />Jessica Ramos is a real Democrat (not someone who leaves the party caucus to vote with the GOP,) a community activist and genuinely good person. We can make this happen. Remember every voter, votes. It&#039;s our right!<br />&nbsp;

				Anyone else getting them? A volunteer called me&nbsp; and when I interrupted her trying to explain she was wasting her time about 20 seconds in to her spiel about why he joined the IDC (because Trump) she told me it was rude of me to interrupt her and to also very angrily tell me I was uninformed.<br /><br />I also had a rather nice fellow stop by my door a day or two ago. He was good-natured and didn&#039;t take it personally when I told him Peralta&#039;s switch to the IDC made certain I&#039;d vote for his challenger. I wished him well.

				I can deal with the phone calls. I either turn off my ringer or ignore numbers that I don&#039;t recognize. It&#039;s the door to door campaigns that are driving me nuts though, because I mostly work from home, often working against tight deadlines. I&#039;ve made a habit of putting a sign on my door that reads &quot;WORKING! DO NOT DISTURB!&quot; It mostly works, but a couple of days ago someone from Peralta&#039;s team took it to mean &quot;ring the bell and knock until someone answers.&quot; They got a bit of an ear full for that.

				^well, the thing is, if you&#039;re registered with a party, it&#039;s public information. Considering how low turn out typically is for primaries&nbsp; -- and let&#039;s remember that if more moderate Republicans had actually voted in the primaries, chances are pretty good the troll-in-chief would not be the head of the Executive branch of the federal government -- I don&#039;t really have an issue with the campaigns reaching out to me. Especially on the sidewalk, that&#039;s public space after all. As an informed citizen, it&#039;s something I took in to account when I changed my political party.<br /><br />What I do take particular issue with is a representative of a campaign arguing with me aggressively and very rudely -- apparently she thought she was entitled to deliver a monologue to me and my interrupting her after I realized she was going to go on and on and on and on was the height of rudeness -- and conflating disagreement with the campaign&#039;s talking points about why her candidate aligned himself with a group helped Republicans have control over the NYS Senate in spite of being the minority with ignorance. I am confident Senator Peralta would not have approved of this volunteer&#039;s behavior.

				Walked by PS 69 (not my polling place, though it is the closest one to me) and saw a large man with a Peralta shirt handing out leaflets right in front of the polling place, which is illegal. i told him as much and he looked right through me, so i went in to raise the issue with a poll observer who told me she&#039;d deal with in. when i came back the other way about 20 mins later, he&#039;d moved to a space literally 18 inches off the curb. i didn&#039;t bother pressing the issue a second time.

				Re your question on turnout numbers-- I&#039;ve seen some preliminary things coming in, all suggesting pretty amazing turnout for a state primary.<br /><br />From an NBCNews reporter:<br />&quot;MASSIVE turnout surge in NY: Somewhere around 1.4 million will cast a ballot in the Dem gov primary, almost 2.5 TIMES the 2014 total.&quot; <br />https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/1040439653919350784<br /><br />From Gannett Albany reporter:<br />&quot;Turnout was way, way, way up compared to 2014.<br /><br />2014 NY Dem governor primary: 574,350 ballots cast<br />2018 NY Dem governor primary: 1.4 million ballots cast with 94% reporting and paper ballots left to count&quot;<br />https://twitter.com/JonCampbellGAN/status/1040442687634268161<br /><br />Haven&#039;t seen numbers for Queens, but a Washington Post reporter said on Twitter that turnout in Brooklyn was nearly 3 times what it was in 2014. https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1040439063340298240<br /><br />

Or carry them home with them to put in recycling. I took a card from one candidate for district leader on my way to the polls, and then returned it to him on my back and told him I had just voted for him.
