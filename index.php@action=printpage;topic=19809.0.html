				&nbsp;Listen to our own Catalina Cruz tell her story about how Covid-19 is affecting her constituents and what she is doing about it. She&#039;s a dynamo as we all know but this is a compelling listen to how she sees the pandemic from where we are in the eye of the storm. This podcast is 20minutes long and well worth a listen. The host is Alfonzo Quiros and the producer is Evie McKenna.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://soundcloud.com/user-570401025/the-eye-of-the-storm<br /><br />

				&nbsp;JHBG has another podcast available in its coping with COVID19 series here in Jackson Heights. Stefan Kenney, the proprietor of Stand Alone Cheese, speaks with the host, Alfonzo Quiros, about the issues facing a very small store that was less than one year old trying to survive the pandemic.<br />&nbsp;<br /><span class="bbc_u"><em>Note</em></span>- this is an uplifting story! It&#039;s true that many have taken an enormous hit in the retail sector here. But there are a few bright spots and Stand Alone Cheese is one of them as they pivoted quickly to online orders in an effort to keep their business alive. <br /><br />Give a listen here on Soundcloud:<br />https://soundcloud.com/user-570401025/small-businesses-surviving-coronavirus/s-sbHoa5HTdZN<br /><br />The previous stories are Ed Wesley, President of JHBG, talking about the impact that he sees on the group and it&#039;s JH activities going forward in 2020. And our beloved Catalina Cruz on the type of needs she is seeing and hearing about with her constituents during this time. Both on Soundcloud.

				Looking forward to checking this out. Thanks for sharing. Stand Alone has been providing excellent service during this pandemic. It was impressive how nimble they were when faced with the challenge of keeping their small space open and operating. Their online order form process and light touch pick up has been consistently terrific.<br /><br />There were two weeks where they were the only safe place I could get milk or eggs. If you can, treat yourself to something yummy for this long holiday weekend ahead. They have so much more than just cheese.

				to BEB- this is exactly the reason to share their story. It&#039;s an interesting tale of choices and some very good analytical thinking. They are relatively new to the neighborhood but are filling a void for those. They made some good decisions here in a very tough position and so far the results are positive. The store is full of delicious cheeses and meats, pastas, eggs, breads and a host of speciality items that are a real treat to have locally. They truly know their cheeses.Please visit online if you haven&#039;t already. <br />&nbsp;Wishing them continued success!
