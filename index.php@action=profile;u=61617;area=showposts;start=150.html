					Your biggest cost for a bathroom reno may be plumbing.<br /><br />Your sink and toilet may operate perfectly but not be up to current code. That&#039;s often true of pre-war bathrooms that haven&#039;t been updated. So you may need extensive plumbing work. Before you select tile and vanities you want to get a full bid and scope of work from a few contractors.<br /><br />Btw, IMHO pedestal sinks look nice but are very impractical day-to-day. You lose under-cabinet storage with one, which is a big thing in most bathrooms. Plus they require more cleaning and upkeep. With a regular sink you just clean the bowl and the top. With a pedestal you have to clean the whole darn thing and the visible dust and dirt that accumulates on the sides and back. I had one. Never again.

					With each Yahoo Group you do indeed need a moderator. It can be anyone who&#039;s interested. Their only responsibility would be granting owners access to the list and removing those who have left the building. It&#039;s not that time consuming. They aren&#039;t expected to &quot;moderate&quot; the tone or tenor of the listserve.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have experience with group texting. I&#039;ve heard it involves more complex technology. An e-mail to all the owners would likely be much easier and just as effective.

					Using Yahoo Groups has worked for a few large buildings I&#039;ve lived in.<br /><br />You may want to consider setting up two groups: One for the owners and another for the board.<br /><br />The owners one would be open to everyone in the building and used for whatever they like with the exception of making specific requests to the board or management. For that, the owners would message the board listserve. (The owners would not have open access to the board listserve, just messaging privileges.) The other benefit to a board listserve is it allows them to communicate soley with each other about day-to-day issues and make decisions in a timely manner. <br /><br />This all may sound complicated but it wasn&#039;t. None of these listserves replaced old-fashioned communication to residents. If the board was taking action on key issues they still either mailed notices or posted them in the lobby or placed them under everyone&#039;s door.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					I&#039;d start the managing agent of the building and ask them what procedures are required.<br /><br />There are two steps to adding or removing someone:<br /><br />Write a letter to the board and managing agent explaining what you want to do and providing proof. They will have to change the stock certificate that you have which proves ownership and likely will ask you to sign a new proprietary lease. You probably don&#039;t need a lawyer for either as you aren&#039;t transferring real property just the shares that you own in the co-op corporation.<br /><br />When you say you have the co-owners permission, you will likely need at the very least a notarized statement from the co-owner. This is probably where a lawyer would help as in addition to consent you may want to have a legal document drawn up that protects you from future claims by the co-owner and his or her heirs. You want the co-owner to certify this transaction wasn&#039;t done under duress, etc.<br /><br />If there&#039;s a mortgage in both names you definitely want to call the bank and ask them what the procedures are. This too may require a lawyer and you may even need to do another closing to transfer the mortgage.<br />

					Here are some details from the meeting last night, which I attended:<br /><br />--Top police officials led by the Chief of Patrol (roughly the No. 3 cop in the entire NYPD) came to unveil their new neighborhood community policing initiative. This plan has been rolled out in many precincts and basically assigns a set group of cops to individual sections of the neighborhood and makes them accountable to residents there. Here&#039;s a recent article on what it&#039;s all about: <a href="http://bit.ly/2uWQQfd" class="bbc_link" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2uWQQfd</a><br /><br />--The 115 precinct has now been divided into four sectors (versus nine previously). Each sector will be led by two officers who will oversee the cops assigned to the sector. The two officers main job is to work closely with residents to tackle crime, quality of life issues, whatever comes up, Each pair of cops was introduced and made it clear they intend to be available 24/7 to field calls, manage issues. Each pair gave out their e-mail address and cell phone numbers and said don&#039;t hesitate to call. I was pretty impressed. (I&#039;ll try to get the names and attach the sector map as soon as I can.) <br /><br />--Think of the two cops as local area managers who are there to address ongoing issues like car breakins, burglaries and the like. They made clear they would try to field anything and everything -- except an immediate emergency for which you ought to call 911. They also could serve as an alternative to calling 311, which a lot of people say is useless.<br /><br />--The overall precinct will get 29 more cops for a total of about 120. More patrol cars will also be on the streets.<br /><br />--They took questions and then set time for everyone to meet their sector cop &quot;managers.&quot; The pair I met were young, eager and appeared very ready to work with us. They said call or e-mail anytime and they said they&#039;d visit individually or groups to address concerns.<br /><br />--It&#039;s clear they want to involve the community but the cops were told overall they need to do a better job in initiating participation. As an example they were told how little community outreach was done to spread the word of this meeting. I didn&#039;t see one flyer posted anywhere about this meeting. I went to Daniel Dromm&#039;s website and didn&#039;t see information there. Nor did he appear to spread the word by e-mail. That would explain why there were only about 50 people there, most of them veteran neighborhood residents who have long been active in the area. <br /><br />--One ironic side note: The Chief of Patrol made clear how important it was to work with the community and serve the neighborhood. Yet for this event they closed the entire street and swept it of cars&nbsp; -- it seemed mostly to allow him to roll up in a gleaming black SUV and security. I understand the cops are probably freaked out lately due to recent events but it seemed a bit much to shut an entire street and inconvenience lots of people.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Sorry for the length.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

					I live on 80th Street between 37th and 35th Avenues and there&#039;s a lot of honking on my street, day and night, but especially on Saturday and Sunday. And I discovered the main reason is that cars and trucks double park on 37th and clog up traffic flow and so drivers think honking will help. I think if the traffic agents were more aggressive in cracking down on double parking on the avenue it would&nbsp; decrease slogs on the side street -- and honking.

					If you have signed the contract, a good real estate lawyer should be able to help you suss out if there are any issues with the building. A Google search will be of limited use. Most lawyers today send the co-op managing agent an extensive list of questions that the co-op is required to answer as part of due diligence. If there are red flags your lawyer ought to find them -- and can advise you to pull the plug on the deal.<br /><br />Prior to making an firm offer, you can also ask the broker to provide you with the financial statements of the building. Even if you don&#039;t have much of a financial background you can probably spot some issues. Things to be concerned about:<br />--Lack of an adequate reserve fund. What&#039;s adequate? Just ask yourself: If the building had to replace the roof tomorrow would there be enough money on hand to do so?<br />--High expenses for&nbsp; repairs such as plumbing.<br />--High expenses for legal advice.<br /><br />You should also ask the broker what the sublet policy is. If it&#039;s liberal, well, that&#039;s a red flag in that it may mean the building has lots of renters. Renters in and of themselves aren&#039;t bad but a large percentage could affect resale and/or quality of life.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
