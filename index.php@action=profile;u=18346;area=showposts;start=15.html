					Cubs at St. Mark&#039;s were a real eye opener to me as a tenderfoot when on Saturdays there were paper drives, scrap metal collections, tires, that we would collect in our wagons and bring back to the parish house where fathers would sort and load them onto trucks to deliver to scrap dealers and raise funds for aiding &quot;DP&#039;s&quot; (displaced persons) and other deserving charities. Cleaned up the neighborhood to my eye and got a lot of junk out of basements, cellars, and garages. The same with clothing drives, bake sales, going to Veterans Hospitals and pushing wheel chair bound folk to their activities. All wonderful events and great experiences for young kids to participate. North pointing principles were the goal of Pack 201. Fine leadership by Fr. Schofield and Cub master Fuller. My hero at the time was an older boy Bobby Case who lived in my apt. building and he was probably (15-16) an Explorer Scout and introduced me (9) to his St. Mark&#039;s friends. Listening to their camping and Jamboree activities started my interest in real scouting later on. Amazing to still be able to remember the names and some faces of kids have not seen or heard from in 40 years. Johnny Williams, Jimmy Laffin, Kevin Gordon, Ted Schroetter, Dicky Ryan, Morgan Healy, Ed Mazilauskas, Charlie Ramos La Salle, Jimmy Buckland........what a bunch of feather-merchants!&nbsp; You are right about the memories. Nice and mellow.

					Good morning! We also had a family Victory Garden in our lot (all the neighbors) on the corner of 82nd St. &amp; 35th Ave. NW where we all grew tomatoes, carrots, etc. around the edges. Was in the Cub Scouts at St. Mark&#039;s Pack 201. Pastor was Scofield and Cub Master Fuller. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school (right alongside Garden Country Day) then to kindergarten at P.S. 69, and grammar school at St. Joan of Arc. My folks moved to JH when they were married in 1930 and both passed away in JH in the 80&#039;s. Great memories.

					Physicians Hospital was the place my uncle went for a hernia operation and was in the place for the next 3 months back in the 50&quot;s. The Dr&#039;s there were really creepy. He must of had a good Blue Cross/Shield policy.<br /><br />Speaking of great soda places Jyust (Joost pronounced) had the best black and white sodas and the candy store opposite accross Northern Blvd to the west of the Boulevard Movie Theater Maxies had great Bryers ice cream milk shakes.<br /><br />There was a mens habidasher&nbsp; on 82Nd between 37th and Roosevelt Ave. on the east side named Cyril Anderson&#039;s that had really good upscale clothes. Mr. Anderson was an Englishman, very pleasant and half of Jackson Heights teenage boys were in like with his beautiful. smart daughter Lori. I believe she became a famous womens clothes designer after graduating from Syracuse Univ.<br /><br />In the late 40&#039;s early 50&#039;s there was a spectacular hamberger place on SW corner of 77th and 37th Ave, EDSON&#039;S, where our pal Pete Edsons dad cooked by the plate glass window. Pete worked for Ray Kroc in the early 60s as the guy who selected franchisees for McDonalds before they went public.<br /><br />Lots of really nice people chose Jackson Heights to live in. Nifty place to grow up in, even though the developers took all our lots away from us.&nbsp; <br /><br />7th and 37 Ave <br />

					Funny to think of your attending the Song of Bernadette at the movie theater, we had the same experience when Joan of Arc with Ingrid Bergman came out. The whole school went down to the auditorium one morning and saw the movie. That was the only time I can remember the whole school in the auditorium together! In 1954 had the good fortune to go to California, Santa Ana, for the Boy Scout Jamboree with a Scoutmaster Arthur Ryland from Carona. Good man and good leader. Went there by train through the South and back the northern route by way of Chicago stopping at grand places along the way. One of the famous Jackson Heights stars I went all through grammar school with is the playwright John E. CARE who wrote THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES (the apartment he lived in on 82nd Street left side just before 37th Avenue that had &quot;blue leaves&quot; wallpaper in the lobby.) TWO GENTELEMEN OF VARONA (adaptation of Shakespeares) as well as the movie ATLANTIC CITY starring Burt Lancaster. As a young boy John Guare wrote short stories about his life that were read aloud in class by Sister St. Catherine and again a few years later by Sister Carmella two very fine ladies who were members of the Gray Nuns of the Sacred Heart teaching at St. Joan&#039;s. His efforts were hysterical and very original at the time and he continued writing stories at St. Johns Prep and then at Georgetown and Yale. I believe it was Tony Hope (Bob Hope&#039;s son who was at Georgetown) was helpful to John Guare in his career. I recently learned that another schoolmate has moved back to Jackson Heights and lives in his parents apartment and loves living there.

					Born in 1938 and lived at 34-57-82nd Street with my folks who moved there when they were married in 1930. Went to nursery school at Mrs. Wills (right alongside of Garden Country Day School), P.S. 69 for Kindergarten, and St. Joan of Arc Grammar School graduating in 1952. Loved the lots in Jackson Heights for playing ball, burning Christmas trees, etc., and missed them in the late 40&#039;s after WW II when they all seemed to disappear.&nbsp; Was a cub scout in Pack 201 at St Mark&#039;s Episcopal Church, and a scout in Troop 217 at P.S. 69. Had many good friends growing up and remember many, many good times.&nbsp; &nbsp;

					Good story that I never heard. I was born in Jackson Heights in 1938 and lived on 82 Street and 35th Avenue. Went to Mrs. Wills nursery school, P.S. 69 for Kindergarten and graduated from St. Joan of Arc Grammar School in 1952. Nellie Spears&#039; cakes were always my birthday cakes of choice. Especially one white cake with white icing that was particularly delicious. Big event out was a hamburger at Edson&#039;s on 37th Avenue and picking up a Nellie Spear treat for desert. By the way Edson&#039;s son became an early executive with McDonalds before they went public in 1966.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;
