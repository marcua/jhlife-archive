			<br />--- Quote from: Shelby2 on December 15, 2021, 01:28:51 PM ---They already had their first class on Monday night of this week - figure drawing, or at least that&#039;s what showed on their IG (I am not certain if they had it or if it got rescheduled). Also they are making room to have gallery space where they can show the work of local artists. It&#039;s not really a gallery in the traditional sense but there is wall space to hang artwork -- above the shelving areas where the supplies are displayed. So you&#039;d look up to see the work, which will hang from molding hooks supported by the existing molding.<br /><br />There is a credit card surcharge of 3% on purchases, so bring cash if it bothers you to pay a surcharge. I understand why they are passing the charge on to the customer. Otherwise the store pays the fee, or else the products have to be priced higher.<br /><br />--- End quote ---<br /><br />Great!
