				Dear Parents,<br /><br />Are you frustrated that your child&#039;s school spends more time teaching skills rather than content?&nbsp; Are you looking for classes that give your child time to explore a topic in depth? Jackson Heights Enrichment Academy is offering classes in Geometry and Greek Mythology this fall on Saturday mornings (see descriptions below). If you would like more information, please email me at alexiskandrews@gmail.com or visit www.jhenrichment.com.&nbsp; Enjoy the rest of your summer!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Alexis Andrews <br />__________________________<br /><br />Greek Mythology/Write Your Own Myth (Ages 7-9)<br />Children are introduced to Greek Mythology through read alouds and writing activities.&nbsp; Each class focuses on a different myth, including The Story of Cronos and Zeus, Prometheus, Pandora&#039;s Box, Theseus and the Minotaur, The Labors of Hercules, and Demeter and Persephone.&nbsp; During the last few class sessions, students write and illustrate their own myths explaining a phenomenon in nature.&nbsp; We will publish our myths and students will receive a professionally-bound copy of their book.<br /><br />??Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Schedule:&nbsp; &nbsp; Once a weekâ€“Saturdays from 10:00 -11:00 a.m.<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Length:&nbsp; 10 weeks, 9/15/12 to 11/17/12<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tuition Fee:&nbsp; $175<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Materials Fee (optional): $20-$30 (for copy of book purchased from www.blurb.com)<br />&nbsp;Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Location:&nbsp; Community Church<br />&nbsp;<br />Fun with Geometry:&nbsp; Exploring Geometry through Tessellations, Origami and Tangrams (Ages 5-7 and 8-10)<br />Geometry is everywhereâ€”in everyday objects, in art, in the layout of our cities, and in nature.&nbsp; In this class we will explore math concepts such as symmetry, angles, congruence, fractions, proportions, and probability as we learn about tessellations, tangrams and origami. We will discover the connection between art and math by analyzing the geometry in architecture and works of art.&nbsp; We will also develop our critical thinking skills through the use of logic, deductive reasoning, analytical reasoning and problem solving.&nbsp; Hands-on activities, puzzles and games will stimulate your childâ€™s interest in geometry.&nbsp; Children will create their own Moroccan-inspired tiling pattern and Escher-style tessellations, make an origami mobile, solve tangram puzzles, and design a â€œGeometric Town.â€&nbsp; ? <br />&nbsp;<br />Ages 5-7:&nbsp; Once a week-- Saturdays from 9:15 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. at Community Church<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Length:&nbsp; 10 weeks, 9/15/12 to 11/17/12<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tuition Fee:&nbsp; $160<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Materials Fee: $10<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />?Ages 8-10: Once a week--Saturdays from 11:00 a.m. - 12 p.m. at Community Church<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Length:&nbsp; 10 weeks, 9/15/12 to 11/17/12<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tuition Fee:&nbsp; $175<br />Â·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Materials Fee: $10<br />&nbsp;
