				When I passed by Espresso 77 this evening n(~8pm), I noticed that there was art hanging on the walls. That felt like a &quot;near opening&quot; touch to me- does any one have any inside information about an opening date? I am on the list to get an email when they have an official date, but I&#039;m getting antsy! It&#039;s been a long time since August.

				pretty much what you&#039;d expect for an espresso drink - I&#039;m sure they are on par with starbucks, but MUCH more wonderfully made.&nbsp; The beans are very high quality and the baristas really know their business. The drip coffee and the pastries are totally reasonable as well and completely delicious.

				Considering some of the posts I&#039;ve seen recently about the neighborhood not needing upscale and &quot;expensive&quot; restaurants and cafes (in other blogs), the clientelle that was present today at 77, certainly told a different story. With the number of strollers outside the door, it certainly felt like we were in Park Slope. <br /><br />I hope this is the beginning of a trend of much more well thought out restaurants, cafes and retail shops, with a better ambience than is currently available in most of Jackson Heights.<br /><br />Go Espresso 77! I just wish your space was bigger!

				So I couldn&#039;t resist and stopped by Espresso 77.&nbsp; Had a mochachino (sp?) and a brownie.&nbsp; Both were absolutely delicious!&nbsp; The brownie had a deeply rich chocolate flavor, and I did detect a bit of a kick to it.&nbsp; Possibly some heat?&nbsp; Wonderful!

				Shelby, the sale of the coffee beans was planned ahead of time, but also a recent addition.&nbsp; With regard to their coffee, so far I&#039;ve only had their bold drip and a latte with skim milk.&nbsp; Both were delicious!&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard rave reviews from my neighbors about their holiday beverage offering.&nbsp; I can&#039;t recall the name, but they say it contains chocolate and peppermint and is very rich and smooth at the same time.

				So I bought another pound of coffee from here instead of going to a Starbucks.&nbsp; I have to see if it was a fluke last time that the coffee was DELICIOUS.&nbsp; Now my Starbucks ground coffee tastes more bitter than usual in comparison.&nbsp; We&#039;ll see tomorrow when I brew up a cup.

				IT&#039;S OFFICIAL!!!! (unofficially, of course&nbsp; :)) my ground coffee from Expresso 77 is much smoother and richer tasting than the ground coffees I usually buy from Starbucks.&nbsp; At $14 a pound they&#039;re more expensive than Starbucks.&nbsp; But definitely superior in taste.&nbsp; I think they should do what Starbucks does for that price: offer a free small cup of coffee with the purchase!!!

				Doesn&#039;t E77 have a promo card?&nbsp; You have it punched when you make a purchase.&nbsp; Punch the entire card and you get a free cup of brewed coffee.&nbsp; They still have this right?<br /><br />I spotted croissants in the small display case today.&nbsp; Wasn&#039;t aware that they were offering them, and had I not had a huge breakfast over at City Coffee, I would have settled on a cup of coffee and croissant. :smitten:

				I have a question that hopefully someone here might be able to answer (julesnyc, if you&#039;re around, feel free to chime in):<br /><br />If I bring a travel mug to espresso77, will they fill it for me? (Even if it&#039;s a starbucks mug?) And if so, how much would it cost? I&#039;m the worlds clumsiest person, and getting a regular cupful would result in a coffee covered abee. Not to mention the obvious perks of environmentalism!&nbsp;

				When is Espresso 77 going to start offering accompaniments to coffee that are not dry and tasteless?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get the loyalty to Ambrosia baked goods since the stuff is mediocre. With so many really wonderful vendors to supply great pastry in this city, why sell something so dreadfully boring. Of course, some people will be outraged by any hint that Ambrosia is not up to snuff. But those who know what really good baking is know that Ambrosia is second rate. What a shame that a place that serves such good coffee can&#039;t offer more savory sweets.

				Or even have some low-fat, low-calorie, healthy alternatives to pasteries--like fruit or vegtable plates, salads, etc. Can be nicely arranged and fresh, and have some creative combinations. I have to agree about the Ambroisa pasteries--not worth the empty calories.

				When I went, maybe it was awhile ago, they didn&#039;t. However, someone else on this list had mentioned that they were lacking in this. Seemed that individual was a regular there. Perhaps my misunderstanding. Also, <br />no need for sarcasm. Could&#039;ve just informed me they had this things. Sorry if I agree with the poster who feels Ambroisa is mediocre. I found Green Plaintains to be such as well, and it so did the Gazette. Just because it&#039;s homegrown in JH doesn&#039;t mean it has to be good. <br /><br />FYI, soup isn&#039;t necessarily healthy, esp if it&#039;s loaded with salt and yes, fat.

				I have a friend who recently spoke with someone from Ambrosia also requesting lower fat items.&nbsp; This seems to be in the works.&nbsp; In the meantime, I&#039;ve noticed that E77 has grown a lot in terms of food offerings since they opened.&nbsp; For the small business that they are, they&#039;re working quite hard to please all as much as possible by offering a decent variety of items ranging from sweet and savory pastries, soups and salads, wraps and sandwiches, bagels and croissants, cereal bars and even your basic hard boiled egg.&nbsp; They also have a small basket of apples and bananas for those opting for fruit.&nbsp; All this, and then add entertainment and small art viewings to the mix.&nbsp; Pretty amazing for such a small shop.<br /><br />My husband is not a coffee or tea drinker, so on our first visit to E77, he was a bit disappointed that they didn&#039;t sell Coke.&nbsp; Imagine my surprise when I spotted Coke bottles on their display!&nbsp; Wow...I&#039;m actually excited about Coke.&nbsp; Their amazing coffee is my first priority though!

				Hi there - Julie here from Espresso 77...<br /><br />Just want to post an update - we are definitely aware of the seating/computer issue and we are trying to find a way to solve it that works for everyone.&nbsp; Please bear with us - and if you have a creative suggestion for how to ease the space crunch, please let us know!

				hey Julie, orzabelle is right on about signs being posted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More ideas: <br /><br />A sign ON EACH TABLE that says &quot;during lunch hours -- say 12noon to 2pm -- no computers allowed so people can sit and eat their lunch&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Or better yet, how about &quot;please don&#039;t sit for longer than 30 minutes with your computer to allow patrons a place to eat&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />OR if you know certain hours are slower than others, designate the slow hours <strong>only </strong>for people with computers.&nbsp; Say after the morning rush, after lunch hour... etc.&nbsp; And post a sign with the &quot;computer friendly hours&quot;.<br /><br />If it were my business, I&#039;d lose the Wi-Fi.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like you have a ton of available seating.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t give a crap about the &quot;cool&quot; factor.&nbsp; But that&#039;s just me.

				I don&#039;t know about the new half hour rule...I prefer the idea to limit laptop usage to slow hours.&nbsp; The shop lost my husband and I as customers awhile ago when the laptop invasion started.&nbsp; There was never a seat available and I felt like the laptop users were given carte blanche on their time.&nbsp; Under the new rule, their time is limited, but that&#039;s not going to help me when I walk in (without a laptop) and want to sit down and eat for 15 minutes.&nbsp; There will just be more turnover of laptop users in there.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t make sense that such a small shop would include Wi-Fi as part of their business model.&nbsp; How many more customers like us are they losing to accommodate the smaller number of Wi-Fi users?

				And who says that all the laptop users are there for the free WiFi?&nbsp; Maybe they&#039;re just working offline, which if this is the case, WiFi is least of the issues.<br /><br />I really like Espresso 77, but I too have to admit that I find that I do more take-out than eat in because of the laptops.&nbsp; It just seems that the hours that I&#039;m available to stop in seem to coincide with the hours that people are working there.&nbsp; For example, I meet with a friend for coffee once a week and each time we&#039;ve tried to go to E77, the tables are occupied by LT users.&nbsp; As a result, we&#039;ll end up at Lety&#039;s.

				Hey folks,<br /><br />Each one of those tables has <span class="bbc_u">2</span> chairs. Sit in the other chair. That is why it&#039;s there. You don&#039;t give someone in the subway an extra seat, do you? You don&#039;t actually have to talk to the LT user. In fact, if they are working, give them their space, but don&#039;t let them take your space.<br /><br />The scrambled egg, ham &amp; cheese wrap, crisply toasted, is amazing for breakfast or anytime. It is huge and great for an early dinner. That and a coffee is a whole meal anytime. Mmm, tomorrow maybe.<br /><br /><br />

				In addition to the sign I saw posted today, which is a very reasonable policy, perhaps a computer section (yes I know it would be very small) would be a good idea, at least during peak hours. I don&#039;t know how popular the big seats in the window are, but perhaps they could be replaced by a narrow table set up just for computer users.

				I like E77 but the last two times I went there a girl who works there was not very professional.&nbsp; She talks about the customers when they are right there, in hearing range.&nbsp; She is mean to her fellow employees, I heard her yell at another quiet girl who works there.&nbsp; She waits a long time after you order 2 things to tell you one of the things is not available, then you have to get the one thing and go to another place to get something else to eat.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m torn. <br /><br />I really do LOVE that E77 exists and I applaud the owners for taking a risk and opening up such a great and needed place in JH.<br /><br />On the other hand, I work from home, and sometimes it&#039;s nice to get out of the house for a while. I admit E77 is small (and maybe these policies would change if they ever expand), but I try to be aware of the realities of the situation when I work at a coffee shop, and try to buy a beverage every hour or so, as well as lunch or a snack. If I&#039;m doing this, I don&#039;t really want to have to pay $5 for a half hour (I *think* that&#039;s the rate) for the right to use my laptop. <br /><br />I admit, this is a dicey issue. Like many other things in life, a few bad apples always seem to ruin it for everyone, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the majority of laptop users that are guilty of hogging the chairs. Yesterday I was there for an hour (no laptop) and there was very little turnover -- me, a guy reading a book in one of the leather chairs, 2 people from HSBC having a lunch meeting, a mom with a kid in a stroller, a guy writing in a notebook, and one woman working on a laptop. Based on this small sample, I&#039;m not sure I buy the fact that laptop users are the main or only reason it&#039;s hard to get a table there. The place is small, it&#039;s comfortable, and people (laptop users and others) like to hang out there. <br /><br />As the owners have said in a previous post, this is a work in progress. I think the wireless fees seem a little steep, but they will keep people from camping out at tables with a laptop. I&#039;m not sure what effect, if any, this will have on their bottom line, but I wish them the best.

				Hi - Julie here to clarify...<br /><br />You can credit purchases of food and drink toward the $5 per hour (on weekdays, it&#039;s per the half hour on weekends) - i.e., if you buy $3 worth of food or drink during your second hour, then the computer fee is only $2.<br /><br />Basically, this is helping us deal with the 5-hour campers who only bought one tea during the course of their stay and were slowly driving my sweet husband to a nervous breakdown...90% of our laptop users are good folks who are thoughtful with how they utilize this service.

				Julie here from e77:<br /><br />We do have vegetarian options and even a few things for vegans:<br /><br />-hummus and/or eggplant salad with pita and mixed greens<br />-grilled cheddar and swiss on sourdough<br />-mozzarella, tomato and basil (as a panini or cold sandwich)<br />-vegetable wrap<br />-many of our soups are vegetarian<br /><br />some of our vegan customers bring in tofu cream cheese for their bagels - if enough people ask, we can start stocking it.&nbsp; I was very excited to bring in honey hazelnut wafers because with no dairy and no eggs, I thought they would work for vegans, but then I found out that while European vegans eat honey, their American counterparts do not.<br /><br />with our limited space, we can&#039;t carry everything that our hearts desire, but we&#039;ll consider any suggestions that people share with us...<br /><br />

				Hi Julie<br />Sounds great! I will stop in for a good veggie sandwich.<br /><br />By the way, you should offer an extra shot of espresso in a drink for 50 cents.&nbsp; This way people can get a &quot;red eye&quot; which is&nbsp; cup of coffee with a shot of espresso.&nbsp; My partner went into Espresso 77 the other day and was told he would have to pay $4 plus tax for a cup of coffee and one shot of espresso, which is pretty outrageous.&nbsp; Two dollars for an extra shot? He would like to patronize your coffee shop, but he drinks red eyes and usually pays 50 cents for an extra shot, so regrettably, he goes elsewhere.&nbsp; Just some friendly feedback!<br /><br />Rachel

				Hi Chuckster,<br /><br />We discontinued the hard-boiled eggs a while ago...but if we get enough voiced interest, no reason why we couldn&#039;t bring them back!<br />We are also going to start doing some more brunchy-savory things, starting with a new quiche plate this week.<br /><br />Julie from e77

				I just noticed someone placed a new negative review (1 star out of 5) on yelp for E 77.&nbsp; The poster is mad, I guess, because E 77 does not want to serve as this person&#039;s all-day-internet hangout.&nbsp; I support E77 in the need to limit or get rid of wireless, because this service is abused.&nbsp; <br /><br />The people using the wireless tend to take up precious table space, while customers intending to come in and order $20 worth of food and drinks end up passing by and not going in because there is nowhere to sit.<br /><br />The person who posted the review on yelp threatens that he will take his business to Starbucks instead - which sounds to me like it wouldn&#039;t be such a bad thing because in fact it will probably allow E 77 to make more money and stay viable.&nbsp; I would hate for JH to lose Espresso 77 because they are not able to make it financially.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an article from the San Francisco chronicle about the issue of wireless users who stay too long in cafes.<br />&nbsp;Mind Your Business: Paying Customers crowded out of cafe by free wireless users &nbsp;(http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/12/14/BUGF0G7DBI1.DTL&amp;type=business)<br /><br />excerpt from article:<br /><br /><em>Rachel Herbert, owner of the Dolores Park Cafe in San Francisco, has purposefully avoided providing electrical outlets.

				I was disappointed by the lock boxes.&nbsp; I don&#039;t go to E77 too often with my computer except when the place is dead at night.&nbsp; I went in the other week on an off peak hour (I was one of 2 people in the place around 8pm) to get out of the house, get caffeinated, and and do some work for a college class.&nbsp; I saw the lock boxes and was turned off.&nbsp; I can understand having them on there during peak hours, but unless you have a brand-spankin&#039;-new computer, a battery doesn&#039;t last that long, especially if you are doing work that doesn&#039;t involve simply browsing the internet.&nbsp; <br /><br />I vote that they take the lock boxes off during non-peak hours (you know it is dead there after 7 or 8 pm every night pretty much).&nbsp; I was excited to get a lot of work done (not even by browing the internet), but my battery died shortly after I got there and I had to leave.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d hate to see this place go out of business as I really enjoy having it in the neighborhood, but I can&#039;t get behind the lock box policy as it is.<br /><br />It seems that they just need to make up their minds.&nbsp; Wireless or no wireless.&nbsp; I thought that the policy they had before (minimum purchase for computer use during peak hours, all access during off peak hours) worked pretty damn well.

				I think it&#039;s a good idea to just rely on battery life for computers. BUT, originally they wanted to create a space where people just hung out, like in the greenwich village beat style. back then, I assume people just read their books for hours instead of going on computers... but still, they were still just chilling for hours. I am pretty sure that&#039;s what espresso 77 wanted to create... well, do they want people to relax and chill there or not? <br /><br />If they wanted to discourage people from plugging in, they should have just plugged in lamps or other things into the outlets. The lock boxes are very offputting. makes you think they are &#039;the man&#039;. I am not confident they have it all together as far as a coffee shop goes. but at least they are trying.

				Recently I&#039;ve noticed that E77 has changed up some of the varieties of the breaksfast wraps they offer. Some of these are new, and I think it would be tremendously helpful if we knew specifically what each wrap contains prior to ordering. The staff is always pleasant and helpful and usually busy, so at times I&#039;m a bit apprehensive about getting into a discussion about ingredients, etc. On one occasion I ordered an egg and cheese wrap and was pleasantly surprised to find spinach and I believe red peppers or were they sun dried tomatoes?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Just some food for thought.

				Hi,<br /><br />I don&#039;t frequent many places in the &#039;hood with my children where they have to sit and stay still for more than 15 minutes, it&#039;s too exhausting for me. &nbsp;But I will say that when I do, I find myself constantly disciplining them and trying to teach them that when we are in an establishment, it&#039;s not the playground. &nbsp;<br /><br />It is really challenging and takes all the energy out of me. &nbsp;And with four kids, you can just imagine. But that&#039;s what I spend my life doing these days, in addition to a million other things.<br /><br />As I strive to be the best parent, I am not perfect. &nbsp;But I must say that I have as well noticed the children in our &#039;hood running wild. &nbsp;My kids don&#039;t stay still, but they are going to have to learn how to behave as we visit different establishments.<br /><br />I do have to say the following:<br /><br />While I was in front of the cafe a few days ago, there were a few chairs outside the storefront. &nbsp;I did see children lifting the chairs and throwing them around. &nbsp;And they were truly having a blast while the parent was having a conversation. &nbsp;I don&#039;t think anyone was aware of anything that was being done that was inappropriate. <br /><br />We all try our best to parent, and what I find uncomfortable is that when another child is kicking, screaming and simply being a brat, it&#039;s really hard to say something to the parent. And so I&#039;m learning to mind my own business and do the best I can with my children. &nbsp;And that&#039;s all I can do.<br /><br />When I had my first child, he was the boss. &nbsp;I used psychology, and he wiped me out. &nbsp;I was afraid to discipline my child. &nbsp;It was too hard. &nbsp;It was easier to let him do whatever he wanted. &nbsp;<br /><br />I then had the second and things changed dramatically. &nbsp;I learned that I could tell my child to sit and stay still or he would face the consequences. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And then when the third child came around, there was no discussion, no negotiating and really no time to spend on saying a word. &nbsp;It was all about the stare. &nbsp;I&#039;m sure many remember the stare.<br /><br />With the fourth, I use the stare and my commands.<br /><br />So to all the parents out there that have a child that is climbing the walls while you are sitting at a cafe, can you try just a little. &nbsp;&#039;Cause while I&#039;m going nuts trying to make sure my kids are behaving, you are relaxing, while your kids are running around and doing whatever they want to do. &nbsp;<br /><br />And to all that have read the above, I&#039;m just sharing.<br />Also, this was written after an espresso.&nbsp; &nbsp;:smiley6600:<br /><br />To Be Continued . . .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Marlene is totally right.&nbsp; My comment above was just a joke.<br /><br />We stopped going to sit-down restaurants, unless they are buffets or we have lots of family with us to help, about two months ago because the toddler can&#039;t sit still and wait for food.&nbsp; It&#039;s exhausting for everyone!&nbsp; You give up some things when you have kids, but some people have a hard time making the adjustments.&nbsp; One possible trick that friends have tried but not us yet is to call ahead and order so the food is ready when you get there.<br /><br />And in Espresso 77 we can&#039;t linger once the scone or muffin is gone, because toddlers aren&#039;t just going to sit there quietly for very long!

				I agree with both of you and yes, my mother had the stare mastered when I was young. I applaud any parent who makes the effort. Last weekend, however, I saw a group at the cafe that looked like they had been settled in for awhile, commandeered several tables, and were letting their kids run around in the 4 feet of space that Espresso 77 has without a word to them. We stayed only half an hour due to the noise, and they looked like they weren&#039;t budging when we left. Kids making noise outside doesn&#039;t bother me, they&#039;re kids, it&#039;s what they do. Heck, kids making noise at a restaurant that can accommodate it doesn&#039;t even bother me. I just wanted to make it a point that it is a tiny space and some people seem to believe that they provide daycare services.

				I, personally am the mom of two toddlers and I feel a little nervous just bringing the stroller in to buy something and leave NOT because the owners make me feel unwanted w/my kids but the customers always seem completely disgusted if my child (I have never dared take both in at the same time) makes a sound.&nbsp; I really love E77 but I think there are a lot of places I don&#039;t feel comfortable in because my fellow jh residents seem annoyed with young children and they don&#039;t try to hide it.&nbsp; I just figure it i karma because I was like that a little too before I had kids. lol

				wow, &quot;mom&quot;<br /><br />feels weird writing that to someone who&#039;s not my mom :)<br /><br />i am sorry to hear that and a little surprised. i&#039;ve been in there many times when the folks in charge have been around kids who were loud (that, i have no problem with, despite my earlier complaint) and really rowdy (that, i do have a problem with, as stated) and they have been fine with it, even to the point of doting on the kids of other patrons. i can&#039;t remember the last time i saw the place without a pile of strollers!

				I look at it this way:&nbsp; Espresso77 is a public place doing business. I don&#039;t have any more or less right to be there than anyone else. If I am annoyed by noisy kids, it&#039;s my responsibility to get over it. Besides, no one ever sticks around for very long there - unless they&#039;re studying or &#039;net surfing. A modicum of patience goes a long way.<br /><br />What I <span class="bbc_u">do</span> find irksome - and selfish, really â€“ is when parents attempt to wheel <em>double-wide strollers</em> into an already packed, narrow place of business. That&#039;s invasion of personal space, plain and simple. And I doubt a fire marshall would look kindly on such a scenario.<br /><br />Having moved here from Seattle, I am still mesmerized and highly entertained by the creative driving maneuvers of motorists in intersections: U-turns, extreme means of landing a parking space, etc.<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn&#039;t be surprised to see such machinations performed with strollers!

				Since I usually have a stroller, a sort of big one, I don&#039;t get many chances to go, but when I do I LOVE everything!!!! Wish I could go more but I don&#039;t like to feel unwanted by patrons there (the owners and workers are very nice).&nbsp; I am so craving a mocha with extra whipped cream right now!

				I have been in e77 many times with my daughter and have never once felt unwanted.&nbsp; Unless the kids are being unruly, why would you care that others might be staring at you? e77 needs your patronage just as much as they need the patronage of the jerks who might be giving you the evil eye. <br /><br />But honestly, I think its probably only a self-induced fear. Everyone there seems to be very welcoming of families and kids any time I&#039;ve been there. I&#039;ve never felt an urge to leave due to other patrons.

				I am a mother of a super rambunctious three-year-old boy. At one point in my life, I was a single, quiet mingler (yes, I made this word up) so I recall what it is like trying to read a book with a kid &nbsp;running around! Loud or not, it is distracting and irritating! So as much as I love Expresso 77, we rarely venture there! But we always try to go to Sue&#039;s story time which is fabulous!! &nbsp;<br /><br />I would like to add, I have never felt unwanted by the staff or the patrons at e77. It is just my personal thoughts on how I feel about children in small spaces!

				I noticed that the lattes at Espresso 77 has improved ten fold since when I first tried it a year ago. Maybe it was the barista who made it. Though, I&#039;m still upset that an extra shot costs twice as much as it does at Starbucks.

				Great to hear that we keep getting better &nbsp;- if you ever have a drink or food item that isn&#039;t quite what you expected, please tell one of our staff and we will do our best to get something that works for you.<br /><br />Regarding extra shots - please remember that all of our shots are doubles (requiring more ground coffee than a single) and all of our shots are hand-pulled one at a time. &nbsp;Probably works out about even in the end...<br /><br />Thanks for your comments!<br />Julie<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>[Moderator Note:&nbsp; The discussion on tea has been moved to the following thread:&nbsp; Coffee shop on 77 street - lousy hot cup of tea (http://www.jacksonheightslife.com/community/index.php?topic=4646.msg30576#msg30576)</strong>]

				I am very excited about local access to Timmy O&#039;s!&nbsp; I just went for the first time this weekend after a delicious visit to Tortilleria Nixtamal.&nbsp; Here&#039;s hoping it&#039;s not too pricey at Espresso 77!

				The website Groupon is offering a deal for Espresso 77:&nbsp; $2 for $4 worth of food/drink.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve never used Groupon, it&#039;s a site where they offer a daily deal at a big discount, and if a specific number of people buy the deal, then the offer is &quot;on&quot; (see FAQ on the site).&nbsp; It&#039;s a way for businesses to introduce new customers to their products.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only made one other purchase on the site (a spa deal) and everything went well.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been meaning to try Espresso 77, so I&#039;m excited about this one!&nbsp; You also get a $10 credit to your account for each person you refer to the site, so anyone making the purchase would make me happy, too:)<br /><br />Link:<br /><br />http://www.groupon.com/r/uu2897018
