					&nbsp;What if this poster were to delay looking for an apt to purchase in JH by 2 years, let&#039;s say, and they were to take advantage of this being a good market for job hunters. Look for a higher paying job as their current salary seems on the low side five years out of school and possibly have a side hustle that can just be dedicated to the home purchase? <br />&nbsp;Look at the financials that LaChoezia lays out and aim for some similar accounting. For personal reasons of fun/dating in your 20&#039;s, the possible inflated prices right now and a postponement to accumulate more funds, I would strongly suggest a different plan at this time. But best of luck in your search and JH is a great place but not for everyone at every point in their lives.<br /><br /><br /><br />

					<strong> Shopping local is great for so many reasons.</strong> Our local shopping streets, 37th Ave, Northern Blvd. Roosevelt Ave, 82nd St., 74th Street and Junction Blvd. have an huge selection of locally made and international items for your holiday gifting. Whether it&#039;s Hanukkah or Christmas or another holiday of the season, please consider shopping locally. These areas took a big hit with COVID as people were shopping the big box stores we see so much in the neighborhood with deliveries. If you only shifted your purchases locally for these next fours weeks, we could see a big uptick if you are shopping for multiple gifts. Consider adding a stop at a cafe, bakery or restaurant or pick up some wine or spirits while you are at it. Small business Saturday is officially Nov. 28th.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The whole neighborhood will benefit and we will add the holiday spirit to those streets and for those shopkeepers who keep us going these past 20 months and more. Keep it local if you can!<br /><br />&nbsp;FYI - if Saturday doesn&#039;t work for you, the Momo Crawl is back on Sunday and that supports a great local organization. Please try to come out...

					&nbsp;See the above post. Your friends will visit twice a year. You will be biking to neighbors where other young folks live - in the winter, in the rain, etc. If this works for you and you have more than Grandma&#039;s money to back you up, go for it! But am being very honest here in that one of the groups that seems least happy here is the twenty somethings and when we do see them in our building, they do not stay that long. The twenties can be so fun and adventurous that I think you should really consider proximity to your playful side before buying. Otherwise, you might find yourself online way too much...

					&nbsp;The silent majority is the opposition on 34th Ave. Mostly working class people who feel that the excessive street closure impacts them more than others. If you live two blocks away, you might feel that open streets is a delightful use of space. But if you asked most of the residents actually living on or right next to the street, it&#039;s like a party that has gone on way too long. Good while it was in full swing, but now it&#039;s time to get back to reality, back to the here and now...<br />&nbsp; Many of those residents are middle class working people, not heavily wired or available for in person protests. But believe me, they have a voice and are using various channels available. It&#039;s not lost on some people that we replaced a packed weekend soccer game with two tennis courts in Travers Park. Or that we have revamped the kiddie playground multiple times whilst we have slim to no senior facilities in the neighborhood. Or that the asphalt at Travers hosted cricket, soccer, girls softball, rollerblading and a host of misc. things which is now an expensive to maintain green mound used far fewer days of the year. I could go on but there are people who live here who think the ENTIRE community should be factored into the 34th Ave decision, not just those most vocal and most networked.

					&nbsp;I actually think you should look in a neighboring area first because of your age. JH doesn&#039;t have much going on for your age group and you might feel more comfortable in a neighborhood like Sunnyside or Astoria or Ridgewood with more young people. And circle back to JH in the future. The dominant group moving to the neighborhood now seems to be youngish couples, with or without dogs and with or without kids. If you don&#039;t mind being the youngster, go for it but I&#039;ve heard some of some rough treatment regarding income, savings and job security for people your age and am not sure it&#039;s a good process for you at the moment given your stated circumstances. This comes from lots of conversations with your age group with family members and personal history in the nabe. But good luck and buying is a great feeling!

					&nbsp;Open Streets is a runaway project gone amok and seriously needs trimming. And planning. The hours are too long and even many people who loved it initially are getting weary of the issues. People who live on the Ave include many, many detractors, who are not vocal online, but definitely are not happy with this change of circumstances and want the street back as the only street with decent vehicular traffic flow and a formerly excellent bike lane. In a recent report by Transportation Alternatives, the numbers indicated less than 10% of the city residents are active cyclists. So that&#039;s 90% that are not. And the sidewalks in JH are not so great and could use a serious upgrade. Open the discussions to town halls, local votes(specific) and much more information on who runs, who funds and who to call about 34th ave issues.<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>Let&#039;s take a good hard look at this project and make sure all parties are at the table whose lives are being affected. </strong>

					&nbsp; Ah, there are surveys and then there is reality. Please don&#039;t go to that underpass in the dark! The drug activity has increased significantly with the street closures and local residents are fed up. The massive attempts at clean up in recent years of the area around the overpass are commendable and Jimmy Van Bremer even got the HAZMAT folks there as it was so dangerous. But things got worse over the pandemic and even with so many one off Community Clean Ups on 69th street, the area is still very dirty and problematic. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Citibike can apparently put their bikes wherever but the ones I see in Woodside on 31st Ave and near the Habitat store are seldom used as there are many fewer residents there and these are not popular destinations in the area. Vs. mostly empty Citibike stations in Manhattan and here in Queens, near transit or popular dining areas, because many people are using them as transit alternatives.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;An analysis of where use is high vs. random placement is sure to come but why do this odd location to begin with? With the new data collection plans, we can finally access how many people even go beyond the lower 70&#039;s on 34th Ave and if the bikes would much better placed for the neighborhood in the Historic District. But oh no come the shouts, not the Historic District. If we can put up street dining, Citibikes along 37th and on Northern Blvd make much more sense.Because 69th street is actually the edge of Woodside and no one cares that much from either neighborhood about it&#039;s future. Sad but true. Put bike racks where they are needed and will be used please! Cease and desist with random bike rack droppings. <br /><br />note- This forum serves as a place for back and forth discussions on issues large and small in JH. It will be missed! But all good things must come to an end...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

					&nbsp;Exactly!! There is no there there. Nothing. And Citibikes are better used in places where people want to go. Like near amenities or transit. The ones on 31st Ave in Astoria are mostly full every time I see them because that is a more residential area and I imagine most cyclists have their own bikes. Up near Diversity Plaza or on that sad block of Roosevelt between 72-72rd would be great and they already have zipcars there. Placement to desired locations seems critical here and 34th Ave &amp; 69th st. just ain&#039;t that place.

					&nbsp;The funny thing about CITIbike coming here is that JH was offered those bikes early on. The opposition was that we have a full bike lane with bike owners using their own bikes for transit and the rental market for closer rides was not here. Full circle, I think it would be <em>great </em>for us to have Citibikes but not in this godforsaken underpass. Near Roosevelt Ave., someplaces on Northern, near the schools and in the denser parts of the community. Not in this sad area under the BQE unless you wanted to clean it up for real this time. BTW this bike rack is almost exactly in the spot where a man passed away in his TLC car and was unnoticed for many days until his family made police do a search. It was a very sad story.

					&nbsp;Was it Socrates who said the unexamined life is not worth living? No harm in looking at our surroundings and seeing ways to improve. Move the bike rack to where one is needed, not where bikes would be covered in bird crap and close the streets when needed but use sidewalks when few people are out walking, like most of the day in winter months. Seems like good planning, common sense and problem solving as opposed to pettiness.

					&nbsp;This NYT article was interesting about some pay for dog runs in NYC with a wide range of fees. There is a quiet, modest - and well run- dog park here in JH on 69th Street near the corner of 35th Ave with a suggested contribution but these some of the dog parks listed in the times are fancy and expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;If JH wants more dog parks, which direction makes sense for the whole community?

					&nbsp;So ABCD...,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Is that your final answer? Much appreciation for the bike rack here in the underpass of 34th Ave and 69th St ? Personally, I think a walk 3-4 blocks up 34th ave to IS230 which has bikes on every tree and fence around the school and no bike racks would been a better use of resources. That&#039;s just me.<br /><img src="http://" alt="" class="bbc_img" /><br />
