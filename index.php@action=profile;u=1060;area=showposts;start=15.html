					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I know. One part of the communities in Northern Queens and Western Queens are that they are highly trafficked with lots of cars around. Sometimes a person can have a horrible time with even trying to cross the street in those areas in many streets. There also is a severe lack of parking on the streets up there. I think all of us need an alternative route on how to get around up in these areas of Western Queens.

I really like how it is there to help beautify communities. With all the traffic congestion and noise and other things like this in Jackson Heights even high pedestrian travel, maybe if you speak to this group, they can help with this. It has lots of traffic and congestion as an area.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>similar topics merged by moderator</em>

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- What do you all in Jackson Heights think of the new 7 Trains that New York City Transit put on the lines??? I think they are better when it comes to seating. Where I live, you have the disguisting A Train, which I can not stand and they have both types of trains where you have the small box seats where you sit in one seat and the bench like seating where there is a row where you sit and you all sit together like you are on a bench or something like that. I think I like the new 7 Trains because they help the customer in terms of seating. You have the box seating now on these trains that are also used on lines like the 1 and 9 and used to be on the 4 and 5 like that. I think there is a better choice and selection of seats on the trains now. But, however, I think standing room went down, the train seems more congested in terms of standing room. This is just my thoughts. The A Train seems to now favor the bench seating and it is harder to find seats, they have trains like they have on the L Train or M Train on the A Train now, it is a disguisting way to ride. I do not like the A Train compared to other lines around you like the R or the V or the 7 for many reasons, but the seating has gotten bad on the A Train.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- One interesting part of Jackson Heights is that it has such an interesting selection of houses and apartments inside of it. If you travel down Broadway, you will see only businesses the same applies to Roosevelt Avenue, for example. But, if you start going down some of the back streets, you start to see apartments and houses. I never saw that before in my life. I know Sunnyside has lots of apartments, but apartments only. Another area that may mix apartments and houses is Woodside, I think. I never saw such a large selection of houses and apartments as I see in Jackson Heights. It has such a diverse selection of all types of homes. I was thinking since East Elmhurst is north of you, maybe the homes there are sort of a carry over to the mostly residential East Elmhurst north of you, but maybe not. But, it really has a diverse selection of houses inside of it, being Jackson Heights.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- If you have ever seen the intersection of Broadway and Roosevelt Avenue, you will see how ridiculous the intersection is to cross even with a car. Because of congestion on Broadway both ways and Roosevelt Avenue being congested and the pedestrians, it is one heck of a hard intersection to cross. I crossed that intersection by both car and by foot and almost got into an accident all times I crossed it. I think this is because of all the traffic on Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway and the pedestrians all around. This is one dangerous intersection though.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, that is so true about bus service in Queens. You can get around easy with them. One reason for that, my dad told me is like the Q46 may be that way because people who live out in Glen Oaks, New York or Lake Success out in Nassau County, New York may NEED to get to the New York City Subways. The same applies to routes that are in other eastern areas like Springfield Gardens, these people need a bus to go up Merrick Blvd and even part of Merrick Rd and Valley Stream to get them to the necessary subway to get them to Manhattan. Yes, bus service, especially in Queens can be that way, especially all the way out there. If you look at many New York City Transit bus routes they all go from the farms out there to the major areas where you can pick up buses like Jamaica Terminal or Queens Boulevard, for example because the people out there need public transportation to get them from Queens or even Western Nassau County, like the bus around Green Acres Mall to get to the necessary subways. yes, I agree with you on that. I think the buses and their routes out there are even more reliant in Eastern Queens and part of Western Nassau County, New York than where you are where you have trains also on top of buses. My dad told me this once. People rely on these buses.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I found that to be so unique for the area. You travel around and see lots of unique restaurants around the area. It is more in Sunnyside, but you may know the reason why for that because it is on Queens Blvd right by the border, the same may apply to Elmhurst and as far as Forest Hills because they are sort of on the road by the bridge. But, Jackson Heights is all the way up there, sort of hidden in the North there, the only real major connections around the bridge there is like Broadway which runs around the area of the bridge, but is like in Astoria before terminating in Elmhurst, New York. It seems so striking how the restaurants are diverse in Jackson Heights when it is like a small community up there North. It is not on Queens Blvd by the bridge!!!! Areas, I said, like Corona and Richmond Hill are just into really food of the people who live there, which are communities, one is, sort of by the airport. Wow. I can not believe that, it is a community up north there with only Broadway sort of,it begins in Astoria, the only way making it close to the bridge, you also have Roosevelt Avenue also. Yes. Thank you for your reply here. Yes.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I AGREE SO MUCH!!!! Track work is horrible by me. I live in Howard Beach, which is OK as an area but I like Western Queens better. Howard Beach is OK and you have the A Train there. They have this track diversion where you have to get off the A Train at Utica Avenue and get a bus upstairs to Downtown Brooklyn and take the bus to High Street and then get back on to the train again just to get to Manhattan for volunteer work or for enjoyment. Not only do I not like the A Train, I like trains like the R and V and F much much better, this diversion is ridiculous on the A Train by me. You live where buses can get you to a location, I have the Q60 which I rode on yesterday to get me into Manhattan. The R train is not bad either nor are the other trains around there!!!!! I mean I agree with you on the strange diversions the MTA has with trains, especially this one on the A Train. I do not really care for the A Train, however, in the least bit compared to trains by you like the N and R and 7, etc. Better service or something....

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- Yes, a fellow member was telling me that he was having problems with the MTA Website due to overcrowding of buses up there in Jackson Heights. Yes, I agree with him. I have used the MTA Website and it is really bad. Do they listen??? I think they are very busy or something at the MTA website. They do not really listen to me neither. They do not listen to letters or anything like that. I think they are just busy or something, like they will listen to your topic for a couple of weeks, dependant on the importance and then just forget about the topic because they have a brand new one to focus on. You should see how bad the New York City Transit website is. I think the best thing to do perhaps is just try to tell a driver about the problems. The sites are too busy in my opinion, especially New York City Transit for example.Too busy an amount of sites. Honestly. They are busy. They will listen to your topic like for one day if it is not important. Try to get the driver&#039;s attention and see if he or she listens or something. That is the best advice. I was sorry to hear this.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli- I can not believe how diverse restaurants can be in Jackson Heights, New York. You walk down the street there and see so many restaurants around. You may think all of them are like Spanish restaurants but you are wrong if you think that. Some are, but some have the most interesting of food. I find that to be interesting since Jackson Heights is like Hispanic mostly, I believe. It has like Dominican and Ecuadorians, etc. If you go to areas like Richmond Hill, New York, you will see an area which has only Indian restaurants. This is common because it is an Indian community, but Jackson Heights has more of a selection of restaurants and so does areas like Astoria and Sunnyside, I was thinking Astoria more. When I was there in Jackson Heights once, I was expecting only spanish food around the area, but it turns out it had restaurants from all around. Even areas like Corona have like only spanish food inside of them. Elmhurst is more diverse and so is Rego Park, but so is Forest Hills. I can not believe how diverse lots of the restaurants can be in Jackson Heights. It is unique. Some areas like Richmond Hill and Corona really have just the food for themselves. This area has a diversity of restaurants.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli Likes Western Queens and Brooklyn- What do you think of the bus service in Western Queens areas like Jackson Heights, Astoria, Sunnyside, and even areas like the East side of Manhattan across the bay??? Hah. That is some pretty good service by MTA Bus. Where I live, in Howard Beach, the service has improved a little since the MTA took it over, but it is still the same type of service. Today, I was riding on MTA Bus, the Q11 and as if Howard Beach and some other areas are full of electrical wires down, the bus today had an electrical wire that was down in the back of the bus. It was sort of blocking the back door. According to FDNY Office of Inspection, electrical wires in strange spots should be reported to 311, 911, or perhaps who is in charge of them. A bus on the Q 11 went out of service today because I reported the electrical wire slightly blocking the back door on the bus. Besides that, you have buses which were mostly Triboro Coach and Queens Surface up there. You should see how impressive these buses are. You see them almost everywhere around these areas including Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side across the bay. Wow. In some areas, the bus service is no good. You go out to Eastern Queens like Douglaston and Bayside and you have long waits for the bus to come, the area is a little bit like a farm a commercialzied farm and that continues all the way down Northern Blvd to Centereach to a certain degree and you have LONG waits for buses out there!!!!! I can not believe how well the bus service is over in certain areas like yours and Astoria and Sunnyside and even the Upper East Side. Wow. Very good service. If you talk about Long Island Bus, it is a bad wait and so are some buses East on Northern Blvd. Those areas out there are after Flushing, New York heading East are mostly commercial straight until Centereach to a degree, so there may be more people taking cars out there, but the bus service in some areas can be bad compared to how it is in Astoria, Jackson Heights, and even across the bay on the East Side.

					by:Anthony J Trimboli New Member likes Western Queens- Have you heard of a group in Jackson Heights called the Jackson Heights Beautification Group?? I really liked reading it. You have so many areas here around New York City today that are like commercialized areas and are commercialized areas that are like sort of filthy in some way, look at these electrical wires that you see that are cut improperly. Today, an MTA Bus I was on went out of service when I reported an electric wire over the back door that was not cut properly and the driver took it out of service up in Elmhurst. FDNY says that they are not there to pick up electrical wires, but if they are in the road or street or blocking you off, or perhaps live(most are not, funny enough), the people should call FDNY, according to the Office of Fire Investigation of FDNY. Besides that, I like the Jackson Heights Beautification Group because I think it is something which is there to create a positive look to areas like Jackson Heights. I like areas in Queens like Astoria, my own community, being Howard Beach(to a degree), Sunnyside, and yours. They are nice areas to live that appeal to me. I really like how you have a beautification group in Jackson Heights. It is something a little bit different, Queens can be commercialized especially down Northern Boulevard EAST past Flushing, you have commercial areas out there that extend all the way out to Centereach!!!!! I like Brooklyn, New York and Western Queens because it is not all about the commercialization thing. This group really shows that.&nbsp; I mean if you head east on Northern Blvd, you have commercial establishments after Flushing that go straight through to Centereach on Northern Blvd here!!!! At least Brooklyn and Western Queens has a break from that; Howard Beach can too a little.
