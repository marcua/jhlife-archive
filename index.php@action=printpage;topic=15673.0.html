				We probably should have noticed this BEFORE we purchased, but our apartment still has the fuse box (with glass fuses). We know we&#039;re not ripping out walls and re-wiring, but we may replace it with a circuit breaker. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious know anyone&#039;s experiences KEEPING the fuse box. (We have gas stove, no washer/dryer or dishwasher) Am I crazy for thinking that we can keep the fuse box, and just install GFCI outlets?

				i have a two bedroom apartment with a fuse box and we only have issues on summer nights when the AC is running along with too many other things. a blown fuse is just a buck or so, and there&#039;s not a huge problem.<br /><br />been thinking of switching to circuit breakers -- at a cost of about $2000 -- just to add some more outlets (the living room needs more light), but it hasn&#039;t been a big deal here.

				I had a fuse box for several years before I switched over to a circuit breaker. I had the work done when I redid my kitchen, as it seemed to make sense to do it at that time. One thing the former owners had put in was a dedicated line for the a/c in the living room. I think if they hadn&#039;t done that, it would have been hard or maybe impossible to run a high-BTU a/c, which is what the living room needs due to its large size.

				Thanks for the reassurance. Part of our panic was due to a contractor who told us that it would be risky to do floors w/fusebox instead of circuit breaker (but he was conveniently able to install circuit break). <br /><br />We invested in a box of 4 fuses for $5 instead.

				We had our fusebox replaced with a circuitbreaker box back in 2003 by Queensborough Electric and it was only a few hundred dollars. They didn&#039;t have to run any new wiring to the panel, apparently that had been done some time in the 90s. But that is one area of concern, particularly if you&#039;re trying to upgrade your electrical load. You want to make sure the wiring in the riser and in the panel can handle the increased load, otherwise you can burn out (emphasis on BURN) the wiring inside walls or risers.
