Yes, we all love JH and all that, but seriously, $1.45 million? I know a lot of the houses between 35th and 34th Avenues in the 80&#039;s are pretty big - but its a semi-detached, shared drive, tiny yard, regular lot - I can&#039;t see this price. I&#039;ve seen other semi-attached and fully attached listed for sale in recent months, all nice and big, but all under a million (usually in the 750-950 range, but who knows what they closed for). With no pics, I&#039;m suspicious this probably needs a ton of work too. Not familiar with this realtor either - so who knows if they are copying from another local guy who is (in)famous for inflated prices (yet tight lipped about eventual sale price) or if they truly think they&#039;ll be the first house in JH to go for over a million (plus mansion tax for the buyer). <br /><br />Curious about any thoughts you guys have to share - or is it just me?

					Hi all - <br /><br />I&#039;m in desperate need of recommendations for good, reliable and reasonable contractors in JH. <br /><br />I have been trying to get my mother&#039;s kitchen and bathroom done over for nearly a year now. My mother lives in a co-op - Northridge II - and so far the bloody Board has rejected 5 different contractors. These contractors have all worked in JH in places like the Chateau, the Warwick, the Berkley, the Greystones and other Northridge sections. All came recommended from friends or on here (or both) and all were rejected for silly reasons - one was rejected because they thought his insurance coverage was &quot;too convoluted&quot;, another because he wasn&#039;t a licensed plumber (the only one to get that reason even though all would have been installing a new dishwasher - didn&#039;t know a licensed plumber was needed for that!) and silly stuff like this. Needless to say, the contractors weren&#039;t happy and I&#039;m fairly furious over it all. I also have to admit, I don&#039;t understand why the Board rejects them - these contractors have worked and done far more construction-like work (ie; moving walls, putting in pass thrus, combining closets to make one big one, etc.) in buildings that are, in fairness, much better than Northridge and sell for much more - all without any issue. I suppose when a co-op is self managed like Northridge II, this is what you get - Board members making decisions that they have no qualifications or clue about. Annoying nonetheless. <br /><br />I need a contractor who carries all the normal licenses and insurance and who also has a $5 million dollar umbrella coverage. <br /><br />The job, as it is in a co-op, is pretty simple:<br /><br />1. Kitchen - remove the old cabinets, flooring and appliances; lay new floor, paint walls, install new cabinets and appliances<br /><br />2. Bathroom - remove old vanity, medicine chest and light, paint and install new vanity, medicine chest and light<br /><br />3. Painting - rest of the co-op needs to be painted - dining room, living room, foyer and two bedrooms. Removing old ceiling fans in the bedrooms and installing new ones as well as removing chandelier in DR and fixture in foyer and replacing.<br /><br />As I said, fairly desperate to get this done as soon as possible - the mother is insisting it be done by Christmas - so any recommendations, advice, etc. would be greatly appreciated!!!<br /><br /><br />THANKS!<br />J.

					Hi - <br /><br />I was recommended to this board by a friend and hoping someone on here could offer some help and direction. <br /><br />I&#039;m a native &quot;Jackson Heights-er&quot; - no matter how many times I move out, I always wind up back here. Anyway, I&#039;ve been living for the last 7 years in a great apt on 76th - however my landlord (it is a sublet) will be selling so I need to move. Why aren&#039;t I buying you may wonder? Honestly, I&#039;m still recovering from paying for the costs associated with two terminal cancer illnesses in my family. If I could, trust me I would. <br /><br />In any event, I want to stay in JH and am looking for a 1 (or 2) bedroom apt - preferably in the 70&#039;s and hopefully around the $14-1500 or so mark - and a real rental this time, not a sublet from a coop. As I&#039;ve begun looking, I&#039;m running into a lot of coop sublets (which are limited to 1 or 2 yrs max) but hardly anything on real rental units - and I know there are a ton in JH. Even the RE agents I&#039;ve contacted seem to deal pretty much in coop sublets. <br /><br />So anyone know of any or have a 1-2 bedroom rental available September at the $14-1500 mark - please get in touch!! <br /><br />Thanks very much for any and all help any of you may offer!! <br /><br />**If it helps - I&#039;m a 40 yr single white collar professional male with a solid work history; excellent references (professional and personal); references from current and previous landlord; good salary and &quot;OK&quot; credit (see above on paying for costs of two terminal cancer illnesses). Thanks Again!**
