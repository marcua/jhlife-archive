				Does anyone else find the location of this Satellite Museum a bit odd? Who will go to this other than the people that work there? It&#039;s not close to any subway line. There&#039;s an odd shuttle bus that goes there from 74th Street station, but I always assume it&#039;s just the employees riding it.

				Yes, the location is a bit odd, but I&#039;m happy about it anyway.&nbsp; And the location of the Queens Museum itself never seemed particularly convenient to me either, so I&#039;m not sure how much worse this is.<br /><br />If the curators do a good job with this space and the PR people give it enough attention, then it&#039;s possible for it to succeed despite its odd location.<br /><br />There are quite a few other examples of art spaces in weird locations that have ended up becoming a draw simply because the programs were good enough or what they were offereing was unique enough.&nbsp; I think when some galleries first started moving to Chelsea, the rest of the art world thought they were crazy - because who was going to walk all those blocks from the subway?&nbsp; Same thing in Boston when the galleries started their mass exodus from&nbsp; Newbury St. over to the South End.&nbsp; I think there was some amount of outrage and disbelief when MoMA temporarily relocated to Queens.<br /><br />Throughout the country there are other examples, too.&nbsp; Offhand I can think of Judd moving Marfa, TX in the &#039;70s (I&#039;m not sure how much other art was going on there at the time), and Jun Kaneko opened the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art in Omaha when there was not much else artistic there.&nbsp; Both are now widely regarded.<br /><br />So the challenge is to do something great enough that it transcends the location.&nbsp; This remains to be seen.

				It says &quot;ongoing&quot;.&nbsp; (last line of the OP - I know, easy to miss)<br /><br />I always think that if there&#039;s no deadline it means it might be easier to get a positive response - as it cuts down on the number of applicants who can manage to finish something without a firm deadline.
