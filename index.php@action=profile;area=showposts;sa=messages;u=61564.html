					When you are casting a voting to make a point, and not make the world better, you have become part of the problem IMHO.<br />The problem with Washington is the all-or-nothing mentality and the lack of compromise and civility. (well one of the problems)<br />Quite a disappointing move by AOC and the progressives since their constituents are likely the ones most in line to benefit from infrastructure spending.<br />The rich fly their copters to wherever. The rest of us rely on subways, roads and bridges that are not crumbling.&nbsp;

					To me it&#039;s criminal that there has not been a vaccination effort in Coronal/Jackson Heights where the epicenter was one year ago.&nbsp; <br />The politicians have been rushing to open centers where they can get votes, and sadly, many residents in these zip codes can&#039;t legally vote.<br />Shame on them!<br />(hopefully, someone will prove me wrong and there are a bunch of vaccine sites I don&#039;t know about!)

					Finally got to try this place today.&nbsp; <br />Hands down, the best cup of coffee I have had at any place in the Heights. Not even close. <br />(side note: how&nbsp; supposed &#039;French&#039; style bakeries can serve crappy American coffee always perplexes me)<br />Back to Parva.. The pastry selection isn&#039;t huge, but what I had rocked.&nbsp; <br />The place has a great style too.<br />Only negative is the seating is pretty limited, so I could see a situation where I go and there&#039;s no spot to sit.<br />But based on today&#039;s experience, I&#039;ll risk it. <br />Only hope they open as many of these around the neighborhood as they did Seba Seba.<br />The Velasquez brothers really should be congratulated (and supported) on this one!<br /><br /><br />

					First, let&#039;s just admit this is the sort of profiling that cops aren&#039;t allowed to do anymore. Not because it wasn&#039;t a<br />useful tool, but because they misused it, it became racial profiling, and now their hands are tied.<br />But I also have to say....<br />When I first moved to the neighborhood there were cops that would be on foot (some even on horseback)<br />patrolling the area, eyes on the street, etc. etc.<br />Now there are just cops in cars (other that late-nights when a few try to control things on Roosevelt).<br />It makes a difference IMHO

A sizable 17% are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />The survey of 1,000 Likely Voters was conducted on January 10 and 13, 2019 by Rasmussen Reports.

					And now this:<br /><br />Queens Housing Market Shifts In Wake Of Amazon HQ2 Announcement<br />Stribling &amp; Associates<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />QUEENS, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2019 -- Stribling &amp; Associates, a leading New York residential brokerage, today releases the fourth quarter Queens Market Report. The report is the only to cover inventory, reported contracts and sales across the entire borough. Like Manhattan and Brooklyn, Queens recorded a decline in the number of sales as the number of active listings increased. However, the borough managed to record both median and average price increases.<br /><br />&quot;Queens is one of the most diverse boroughs in the city, in terms of what drives prices,&quot; said Garrett Derderian, Director of Data &amp; Reporting at Stribling. &quot;Like Brooklyn, price increases for single and multi-family homes in the far-reaching markets drove overall price growth.&quot; Indeed, Southeastern Queens recorded a median price increase of 10%, and average increase of 11%. Southwestern Queens had equally impressive gains, with its median price up 9% and average up 12%.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We continue to see a spillover effect from Brooklyn, as purchasers get priced out of that borough,&quot; Derderian stated. &quot;We expect growth in those markets to continue at the steady pace it has been, notwithstanding some major shift in the market at-large.&quot;<br /><br />Northwestern Queens, for example, saw an immediate shift with the recent announcement that tech giant Amazon selected the neighborhood for half of its HQ2. Prior to the announcement, there were concerns over whether demand would keep pace with the thousands of new units coming to market. However, once Amazon made the official announcement, those concerns faded quickly.<br /><br />&quot;Long Island City shifted from a buyer&#039;s market to a seller&#039;s market in the blink of an eye,&quot; said Patrick W. Smith, Stribling&#039;s Long Island City specialist. &quot;The Amazon effect was immediate and has boosted interest in the area exponentially. Sellers no longer feel like they have to sell at a discount.&quot;<br /><br />To be sure, Northwestern Queens saw the greatest contract price increases: The median jumped 14%, the average surged 12%, and the average price-per-foot was up 9%. Derderian added, &quot;While we still have to wait to see what the final sales prices are, it is a promising sign for the area, especially as the rest of the city is in a &#039;reset mode&#039; regarding pricing.&quot;<br /><br />Properties in Queens spent an average of 118 days on the market in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than the 116 reported in Brooklyn. This was also the highest number of sales in a fourth quarter above $500K, and the highest percentage of sales above $1.5M.<br /><br />&quot;What we are seeing, especially in the Northwestern submarket, are some record or near-record setting transactions. This is a relatively new phenomenon for Queens but mirrors the heightened activity in the super-prime markets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, although at a lower price point,&quot; Derderian emphasized. Still, he advised these newly contracted sales are indeed a high price-point for Queens.<br /><br />Looking ahead, Derderian offered the following: &quot;We expect growth in all Queens submarkets to continue, although rising interest rates and affordability do present a challenge to that growth. Still, the borough offers many conveniences at a lower price point than Manhattan or Brooklyn, and along with the Amazon announcement, Queens is poised for a promising 2019.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Highlights from Stribling &amp; Associates Q4 Queens Market Report:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Median sales price was $598,781, up 4% year-over-year (record)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average sales price was $675,183, up 5% year-over-year (record)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average price per square foot was $573, down 9% year-over-year<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Average days on market was 118, up from 111 in Q3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There are 7.0 months of supply, up from 6.9 one year ago<br /><br />Recorded Sales:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There were 2,801 recorded sales to date, 5% less than one year ago<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condo units saw an average PPSF of $944<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses made up 65% of closings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-op units had a median price of $340,000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Properties sold between $500K-750K made up 31% of all closings<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 16% of closings were under $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the most expensive market and had 7% of recorded sales<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Southeastern and Southwestern Queens saw the greatest overall price increases<br /><br />Contracts Signed:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a 3% decrease in the number of reported contracts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses totaled 39% of contracts<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condos recorded the highest average PPSF at $1,056<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Houses and townhouses had the highest median price at $858,000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 16% of contracts were priced below $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 20% of contracts were priced above $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Central Queens had the most contracts, with 41%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens recorded the strongest price increases across all measures<br /><br />Inventory:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There were 2,700 active units in the borough, a 4% increase year-over-year<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condos made up 24% of inventory<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Condo units had the highest average PPSF at $963<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Co-op units were the most affordable, with an average PPSF of $475<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 29% of inventory was priced above $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10% of inventory was priced below $350K<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 46% of inventory was priced between $500K-1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the only submarket with a median and average price topping $1M<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Northwestern Queens was the only submarket with an average price-per-foot above $1,000<br /><br />About Stribling &amp; Associates<br /><br />Stribling &amp; Associates, Ltd. is a premier residential real estate firm with over 300 agents throughout five locations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island City.

					I recently used Ranshaw Plumbing and can recommend them.<br />They have insurance and are licensed which most buildings require.<br />They cost a bit more than some other out there but really top notch service.&nbsp; And they often have coupons on their website <br />718-767-0707
